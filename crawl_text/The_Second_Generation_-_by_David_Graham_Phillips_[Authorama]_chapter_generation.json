        "In six minutes the noon whistle would blow. But the workmen–the seven\nhundred in the Ranger-Whitney flour mills, the two hundred and fifty in\nthe Ranger-Whitney cooperage adjoining–were, every man and boy of them,\nas hard at it as if the dinner rest were hours away. On the threshold of\nthe long room where several scores of filled barrels were being headed\nand stamped there suddenly appeared a huge figure, tall and broad and\nsolid, clad in a working suit originally gray but now white with the\nflour dust that saturated the air, and coated walls and windows both\nwithin and without. At once each of the ninety-seven men and boys was\naware of that presence and unconsciously showed it by putting on extra\n\"steam.” With swinging step the big figure crossed the packing room. The\ngray-white face held straight ahead, but the keen blue eyes paused upon\neach worker and each task. And every “hand” in those two great factories\nknew how all-seeing that glance was–critical, but just; exacting, but\nencouraging. All-seeing, in this instance, did not mean merely\nfault-seeing.",
        "Hiram Ranger, manufacturing partner and controlling owner of the\nRanger-Whitney Company of St. Christopher and Chicago, went on into the\ncooperage, leaving energy behind him, rousing it before him. Many times,\neach working day, between seven in the morning and six at night, he made\nthe tour of those two establishments. A miller by inheritance and\ntraining, he had learned the cooper’s trade like any journeyman, when he\ndecided that the company should manufacture its own barrels. He was not a\nrich man who was a manufacturer; he was a manufacturer who was\nincidentally rich–one who made of his business a vocation. He had no\ntheories on the dignity of labor; he simply exemplified it, and would\nhave been amazed, and amused or angered according to his mood, had it\nbeen suggested to him that useful labor is not as necessary and\ncontinuous a part of life as breathing. He did not speculate and talk\nabout ideals; he lived them, incessantly and unconsciously. The talker of\nideals and the liver of ideals get echo and response, each after his\nkind–the talker, in the empty noise of applause; the liver, in the\nsilent spread of the area of achievement.",
        "A moment after Hiram roused the packing room of the flour mill with the\nmaster’s eye, he was in the cooperage, the center of a group round one of\nthe hooping machines. It had got out of gear, and the workman had bungled\nin shutting off power; the result was chaos that threatened to stop the\nwhole department for the rest of the day. Ranger brushed away the\nwrangling tinkerers and examined the machine. After grasping the problem\nin all its details, he threw himself flat upon his face, crawled under\nthe machine, and called for a light. A moment later his voice issued\nagain, in a call for a hammer. Several minutes of sharp hammering; then\nthe mass of iron began to heave. It rose at the upward pressure of\nRanger’s powerful arms and legs, shoulders and back; it crashed over on\nits side; he stood up and, without pause or outward sign of his exertion\nof enormous strength, set about adjusting the gearing to action, with the\nbroken machinery cut out. “And he past sixty!” muttered one workman to\nanother, as a murmur of applause ran round the admiring circle. Clearly\nHiram Ranger was master there not by reason of money but because he was\nfirst in brain and in brawn; not because he could hire but because he\ncould direct and do.",
        "In the front rank of the ring of on-looking workmen stood a young man,\ntall as himself and like him in the outline of his strong features,\nespecially like him in the fine curve of the prominent nose. But in\ndress and manner this young man was the opposite of the master workman\nnow facing him in the dust and sweat of toil. He wore a fashionable suit\nof light gray tweed, a water-woven Panama with a wine-colored ribbon, a\nwine-colored scarf; several inches of wine-colored socks showed below his\nhigh-rolled, carefully creased trousers. There was a seal ring on the\nlittle finger of the left of a pair of large hands strong with the\nsymmetrical strength which is got only at “polite” or useless exercise.\nResting lightly between his lips was a big, expensive-looking Egyptian\ncigarette; the mingled odor of that and a delicate cologne scented the\nair. With a breeziness which a careful observer of the niceties of manner\nmight have recognized as a disguise of nervousness, the young man\nadvanced, extending his right hand.",
        "“Hello, father!” said he, “I came to bring you home to lunch.”",
        "The master workman did not take the offered hand. After a quick glance of\npride and pleasure which no father could have denied so manly and\nhandsome a son, he eyed the young man with a look that bit into every one\nof his fashionable details. Presently he lifted his arm and pointed. The\nson followed the direction of that long, strong, useful-looking\nforefinger, until his gaze rested upon a sign: “No Smoking\"–big, black\nletters on a white background.",
        "“Beg pardon,” he stammered, flushing and throwing away the cigarette.",
        "The father went to the smoking butt and set his foot upon it. The son’s\nface became crimson; he had flung the cigarette among the shavings which\nlittered the floor. “The scientists say a fire can’t be lighted from\nburning tobacco,” he said, with a vigorous effort to repair the rent in\nhis surface of easy assurance.",
        "The old man–if that adjective can be justly applied to one who had such\nstrength and energy as his–made no reply. He strode toward the door, the\nson following, acute to the grins and winks the workmen were exchanging\nbehind his back. The father opened the shut street door of the cooperage,\nand, when the son came up, pointed to the big, white letters: “No\nAdmittance. Apply at the Office.”",
        "“How did you get in here?” he asked.",
        "“I called in at the window and ordered one of the men to open the door,\"\nexplained the son.",
        "“Ordered.” The father merely repeated the word.",
        "“Requested, then,” said the son, feeling that he was displaying\npraiseworthy patience with “the governor’s” eccentricities.",
        "“Which workman?”",
        "The son indicated a man who was taking a dinner pail from under a\nbench at the nearest window. The father called to him: “Jerry!” Jerry\ncame quickly.",
        "“Why did you let this young–young gentleman in among us?”",
        "“I saw it was Mr. Arthur,” began Jerry.",
        "“Then you saw it was not anyone who has any business here. Who gave you\nauthority to suspend the rules of this factory?”",
        "“Don’t, father!” protested Arthur. “You certainly can’t blame him. He\nknew I’d make trouble if he didn’t obey.”",
        "“He knew nothing of the sort,” replied Hiram Ranger. “I haven’t been\ndealing with men for fifty years–However, next time you’ll know what to\ndo, Jerry.”",
        "“He warned me it was against the rules,” interjected Arthur.",
        "A triumphant smile gleamed in the father’s eyes at this vindication of\nthe discipline of the mills. “Then he knew he was doing wrong. He must be\nfined. You can pay the fine, young gentleman–if you wish.”",
        "“Certainly,” murmured Arthur. “And now, let’s go to lunch.”",
        "“To dinner,” corrected the father; “your mother and I have dinner in the\nmiddle of the day, not lunch.”",
        "“To dinner, then. Anything you please, pa, only let’s go.”",
        "When they were at the office and the father was about to enter the inner\nroom to change his clothes, he wheeled and said: “Why ain’t you at\nHarvard, passing your examinations?”",
        "Arthur’s hands contracted and his eyes shifted; in a tone to which\nrepression gave a seeming lightness, he announced: “The exams, are over.\nI’ve been plucked.”",
        "The slang was new to Hiram Ranger, but he understood. In important\nmatters his fixed habit was never to speak until he had thought well;\nwithout a word he turned and, with a heaviness that was new in his\nmovements, went into the dressing room. The young man drew a cautious but\nprofound breath of relief–the confession he had been dreading was over;\nhis father knew the worst. “If the governor only knew the world better,\"\nhe said to himself, “he’d know that at every college the best fellows\nalways skate along the edge of the thin ice. But he doesn’t, and so he\nthinks he’s disgraced.” He lit another cigarette by way of consolation\nand clarification.",
        "When the father reappeared, dressed for the street, he was apparently\nunconscious of the cigarette. They walked home in silence–a\nstriking-looking pair, with their great similar forms and their handsome\nsimilar faces, typical impersonations of the first generation that is\nsowing in labor, and the second generation that is reaping in idleness.",
        "“Oh!” exclaimed Arthur, as they entered the Ranger place and began to\nascend the stone walk through the lawns sloping down from the big,\nsubstantial-looking, creeper-clad house. “I stopped at Cleveland half a\nday, on the way West, and brought Adelaide along.” He said this with\nelaborate carelessness; in fact, he had begged her to come that she might\nonce more take her familiar and highly successful part of buffer between\nhim and his father’s displeasure.",
        "The father’s head lifted, and the cloud over his face also. “How is she?\"\nhe asked. “Bang up!” answered Arthur. “She’s the sort of a sister a man’s\nproud of–looks and style, and the gait of a thoroughbred.” He\ninterrupted himself with a laugh. “There she is, now!” he exclaimed.",
        "This was caused by the appearance, in the open front doors, of a strange\ncreature with a bright pink ribbon arranged as a sort of cockade around\nand above its left ear–a brown, hairy, unclean-looking thing that gazed\nwith human inquisitiveness at the approaching figures. As the elder\nRanger drew down his eyebrows the creature gave a squeak of alarm and,\ndropping from a sitting position to all fours, wheeled and shambled\nswiftly along the wide hall, walking human fashion with its hind feet,\ndog fashion with its fore feet or arms.",
        "At first sight of this apparition Ranger halted. He stared with an\nexpression so astounded that Arthur laughed outright.",
        "“What was that?” he now demanded.",
        "“Simeon,” replied Arthur. “Del has taken on a monk. It’s the latest fad.”",
        "“Oh!” ejaculated Ranger. “Simeon.”",
        "“She named it after grandfather–and there is a–” Arthur stopped\nshort. He remembered that “Simeon” was his father’s father; perhaps his\nfather might not see the joke. “That is,” he explained, “she was looking\nfor a name, and I thought of ’simian,’ naturally, and that, of course,\nsuggested ’Simeon’–and–”",
        "“That’ll do,” said Hiram, in a tone of ominous calm which his family\nknew was the signal that a subject must be dropped.",
        "Now there was a quick froufrou of skirts, and from the sitting room to\nthe left darted a handsome, fair girl of nineteen, beautifully dressed in\na gray summer silk with simple but effectively placed bands of pink\nembroidery on blouse and skirt. As she bounded down the steps and into\nher father’s arms her flying skirts revealed a pair of long, narrow feet\nin stylish gray shoes and gray silk stockings exactly matching the rest\nof her costume. “Daddy! Daddy!” she cried.",
        "His arms were trembling as they clasped her–were trembling with the\nemotion that surged into her eyes in the more obvious but less\nsignificant form of tears. “Glad to see you, Delia,” was all he said.",
        "She put her slim white forefinger on his lips.",
        "He smiled. “Oh! I forgot. You’re Adelaide, of course, since you’ve\ngrown up.”",
        "“Why call me out of my name?” she demanded, gayly. “You should have\nchristened me Delia if you had wanted me named that.”",
        "“I’ll try to remember, next time,” he said, meekly. His gray eyes were\ndancing and twinkling like sunbeams pouring from breaches in a spent\nstorm-cloud; there was an eloquence of pleasure far beyond laughter’s in\nthe rare, infrequent eye smiles from his sober, strong face.",
        "Now there was a squeaking and chattering behind them. Adelaide whirled\nfree of her father’s arms and caught up the monkey. “Put out your hand,\nsir,” said she, and she kissed him. Her father shuddered, so awful was\nthe contrast between the wizened, dirty-brown face and her roselike\nskin and fresh fairness. “Put out your hand and bow, sir,” she went on.\n\"This is Mr. Hiram Ranger, Mr. Simeon. Mr. Simeon, Mr. Ranger; Mr.\nRanger, Mr. Simeon.”",
        "Hiram, wondering at his own weakness, awkwardly took the paw so uncannily\nlike a mummied hand. “What did you do this for, Adelaide?” said he, in a\ntone of mild remonstrance where he had intended to be firm.",
        "“He’s so fascinating, I couldn’t resist. He’s so wonderfully human–”",
        "“That’s it,” said her father; “so–so–”",
        "“Loathsomely human,” interjected Arthur.",
        "“Loathsome,” said the father.",
        "“That impression soon wears off,” assured Adelaide, “and he’s just like a\nhuman being as company. I’d be bored to death if I didn’t have him. He\ngives me an occupation.”",
        "At this the cloud settled on Ranger’s face again–a cloud of sadness. An\noccupation!",
        "Simeon hid his face in Adelaide’s shoulder and began to whimper. She\npatted him softly. “How can you be so cruel?” she reproached her father.\n\"He has feelings almost like a human being.”",
        "Ranger winced. Had the daughter not been so busy consoling her unhappy\npet, the father’s expression might have suggested to her that there was,\nnot distant from her, a being who had feelings, not almost, but quite\nhuman, and who might afford an occupation for an occupation-hunting young\nwoman which might make love and care for a monkey superfluous. But he\nsaid nothing. He noted that the monkey’s ribbon exactly matched the\nembroidery on Adelaide’s dress.",
        "“If he were a dog or a cat, you wouldn’t mind,” she went on.",
        "True enough! Clearly, he was unreasonable with her.",
        "“Do you want me to send him away?”",
        "“I’ll get used to him, I reckon,” replied Hiram, adding, with a faint\ngleam of sarcasm, “I’ve got used to a great many things these last\nfew years.”",
        "They went silently into the house, Adelaide and Arthur feeling that their\nfather had quite unreasonably put a damper upon their spirits–a feeling\nwhich he himself had. He felt that he was right, and he was puzzled to\nfind himself, even in his own mind, in the wrong.",
        "“He’s hopelessly old-fashioned!” murmured Arthur to his sister.",
        "“Yes, but such a dear,” murmured Adelaide.",
        "“No wonder you say that!” was his retort. “You wind him round\nyour finger.”",
        "In the sitting room–the “back parlor\"–Mrs. Ranger descended upon them\nfrom the direction of the kitchen. Ellen was dressed for work; her old\ngingham, for all its neatness, was in as sharp contrast to her daughter’s\ngarb of the lady of leisure as were Hiram’s mill clothes to his son’s\n\"London latest.” “It’s almost half-past twelve,” she said. “Dinner’s been\nready more than half an hour. Mary’s furious, and it’s hard enough to\nkeep servants in this town since the canning factories started.”",
        "Adelaide and Arthur laughed; Hiram smiled. They were all thoroughly\nfamiliar with that canning-factory theme. It constituted the chief\nfeature of the servant problem in Saint X, as everybody called St.\nChristopher; and the servant problem there, as everywhere else, was the\nchief feature of domestic economy. As Mrs. Ranger’s mind was concentrated\nupon her household, the canning factories were under fire from her early\nand late, in season and out of season.",
        "“And she’s got to wait on the table, too,” continued Ellen, too\ninterested in reviewing her troubles to mind the amusement of the rest of\nthe family.",
        "“Why, where’s the new girl Jarvis brought you?” asked Hiram.",
        "“She came from way back in the country, and, when she set the table, she\nfixed five places. ’There’s only four of us, Barbara,’ said I. ’Yes,\nMrs. Ranger,’ says she, ’four and me.’ ’But how’re you going to wait on\nthe table and sit with us?’ says I, very kindly, for I step mighty soft\nwith those people. ’Oh, I don’t mind bouncin’ up and down,’ says she; ’I\ncan chew as I walk round.’ When I explained, she up and left in a huff.\n’I’m as good as you are, Mrs. Ranger, I’d have you know,’ she said, as\nshe was going, just to set Mary afire; ’my father’s an independent\nfarmer, and I don’t have to live out. I just thought I’d like to visit\nin town, and I’d heard your folks well spoke of. I’ll get a place in the\ncanning factory!’ I wasn’t sorry to have her go. You ought to have seen\nthe way she set the table!”",
        "“We’ll have to get servants from the East,” said Arthur. “They know their\nplace a little better there. We can get some English that have just come\nover. They’re the best–thoroughly respectful.”",
        "He did not see the glance his father shot at him from under his heavy\neyebrows. But Adelaide did–she was expecting it. “Don’t talk like a cad,\nArtie!” she said. “You know you don’t think that way.”",
        "“Oh, of course, I don’t admire that spirit–or lack of it,” he replied.\n\"But–what are you going to do? It’s the flunkies or the Barbaras and\nMarys–or doing our own work.”",
        "To Hiram Ranger that seemed unanswerable, and his resentment against his\nson for expressing ideas for which he had utter contempt seemed\nunreasonable. Again reason put him in the wrong, though instinct was\ninsisting that he was in the right.",
        "“It’s a pity people aren’t contented in ’the station to which God has\ncalled them,’ as the English prayer book says,” continued Arthur, not\ncatching sensitive Adelaide’s warning frown.",
        "“If your mother and I had been content,” said Hiram, “you and Delia would\nbe looking for places in the canning factory.” The remark was doubly\nstartling–for the repressed energy of its sarcasm, and because, as a\nrule, Hiram never joined in the discussions in the family circle.",
        "They were at the table, all except Mrs. Ranger. She had disappeared in\nthe direction of the kitchen and presently reappeared bearing a soup\ntureen, which she set down before her husband. “I don’t dare ask Mary to\nwait on the table,” said she. “If I did, she’s just in the humor to up\nand light out, too; and your mother’s got no hankering for hanging over a\nhot stove in this weather.”",
        "She transferred the pile of soup plates from the sideboard and seated\nherself. Her husband poured the soup, and the plates were passed from\nhand to hand until all were served. “If the Sandyses could see us now,\nDel,” said Arthur.",
        "“Or the Whitneys,” suggested Adelaide, and both laughed as people laugh\nwhen they think the joke, or the best part of it, is a secret between\nthemselves.",
        "Nothing more was said until the soup was finished and Mrs. Ranger rose\nand began to remove the dishes. Adelaide, gazing at the table, her\nthoughts far away, became uneasy, stirred, looked up; she saw that the\ncause of her uneasiness was the eyes of her father fixed steadily upon\nher in a look which she could not immediately interpret. When he saw that\nhe had her attention, he glanced significantly toward her mother, waiting\nupon them. “If the Sandyses or the Whitneys could see us now!” he said.",
        "She reddened, pushed back her chair, and sprang up. “Oh, I never\nthought!” she exclaimed. “Sit down, mother, and let me do that. You\nand father have got us into awful bad ways, always indulging us and\nwaiting on us.”",
        "“You let me alone,” replied her mother. “I’m used to it. I did my own\nwork for fifteen years after we were married, and I’d have been doing it\nyet if your father hadn’t just gone out and got a girl and brought her\nin and set her to work. No; sit down, Del. You don’t know anything about\nwork. I didn’t bring you up to be a household drudge.”",
        "But Del was on her way to the kitchen, whence she presently reappeared\nwith a platter and a vegetable dish. Down the front of her skirt was a\nstreak of grease. “There!” exclaimed Mrs. Ranger, coloring high with\nexasperation, “your dress is spoiled! I don’t believe I can take it out\nof that kind of goods without leaving a spot. Hiram, I do wish you\nwouldn’t meddle with the children! It seems to me you’ve got enough to do\nto ’tend your own affairs at the mill.”",
        "This was unanswerable, or so it seemed to her husband. Once more he felt\nin the wrong, when he knew that, somehow, he was in the right.",
        "But Adelaide was laughing and going forward gracefully with her duties as\nwaitress. “It’s nothing,” she said; “the stain will come out; and, if it\ndoesn’t, there’s no harm done. The dress is an old thing. I’ve worn it\nuntil everybody’s sick of the sight of it.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger now took her turn at looking disapproval. She exclaimed:\n\"Why, the dress is as good as new; much too good to travel in. You ought\nto have worn a linen duster over it on the train.”",
        "At this even Hiram showed keen amusement, and Mrs. Ranger herself joined\nin the laugh. “Well, it was a good, sensible fashion, anyhow,” said she.",
        "Instead of hurrying through dinner to get back to his work with the one\no’clock whistle, Hiram Ranger lingered on, much to the astonishment of\nhis family. When the faint sound of the whistles of the distant factories\nwas borne to them through the open windows, Mrs. Ranger cried, “You’ll be\nlate, father.”",
        "“I’m in no hurry to-day,” said Ranger, rousing from the seeming\nabstraction in which he passed most of his time with his assembled\nfamily. After dinner he seated himself on the front porch. Adelaide\ncame up behind and put her arm round his neck. “You’re not feeling\nwell, daddy?”",
        "“Not extra,” he answered. “But it’s nothing to bother about. I thought\nI’d rest a few minutes.” He patted her in shy expression of gratitude for\nher little attention. It is not strange that Del overvalued the merit of\nthese trivial attentions of hers when they were valued thus high by her\nfather, who longed for proofs of affection and, because of his shyness\nand silence, got few.",
        "“Hey, Del! Hurry up! Get into your hat and dust-coat!” was now heard, in\nArthur’s voice, from the drive to the left of the lawns.",
        "Hiram’s glance shifted to the direction of the sound. Arthur was perched\nhigh in a dogcart to which were attached two horses, one before the\nother. Adelaide did not like to leave her father with that expression on\nhis face, but after a brief hesitation she went into the house. Hiram\nadvanced slowly across the lawn toward the tandem. When he had inspected\nit in detail, at close range, he said: “Where’d you get it, young\ngentleman?” Again there was stress on the “gentleman.”",
        "“Oh, I’ve had it at Harvard several months,” he replied carelessly. “I\nshipped it on. I sold the horses–got a smashing good price for ’em.\nYours ain’t used to tandem, but I guess I can manage ’em.”",
        "“That style of hitching’s new to these parts,” continued Hiram.",
        "Arthur felt the queerness of his father’s tone. “Two, side by side, or\ntwo, one in front of the other–where’s the difference?”",
        "True, reflected Hiram. He was wrong again–yet again unconvinced.\nCertainly the handsome son, so smartly gotten up, seated in this smart\ntrap, did look attractive–but somehow not as he would have had hisson look. Adelaide came; he helped her to the lower seat. As he watched\nthem dash away, as fine-looking a pair of young people as ever\ngladdened a father’s eye, this father’s heart lifted with pride–but\nsank again. Everything seemed all right; why, then, did everything\nfeel all wrong?",
        "“I’m not well to-day,” he muttered. He returned to the porch, walking\nheavily. In body and in mind he felt listless. There seemed to be\nsomething or some one inside him–a newcomer–aloof from all that he had\nregarded as himself–aloof from his family, from his work, from his own\npersonality–an outsider, studying the whole perplexedly and gloomily.",
        "As he was leaving the gate a truck entered the drive. It was loaded with\ntrunks–his son’s and his daughter’s baggage on the way from the station.\nHiram paused and counted the boxes–five huge trunks–Adelaide’s beyond\ndoubt; four smaller ones, six of steamer size and thereabouts–profuse\nand elegant Arthur’s profuse and elegant array of canvas and leather.\nThis mass of superfluity seemed to add itself to his burden. He recalled\nwhat his wife had once said when he hesitated over some new extravagance\nof the children’s: “What’d we toil and save for, unless to give them a\nbetter time than we had? What’s the use of our having money if they can’t\nenjoy it?” A “better time,” “enjoy\"–they sounded all right, but were\nthey really all right? Was this really a “better time”?–really\nenjoyment? Were his and his wife’s life all wrong, except as they had\ncontributed to this new life of thoughtless spending and useless activity\nand vanity and splurge?",
        "Instead of going toward the factories, he turned east and presently out\nof Jefferson Street into Elm. He paused at a two-story brick house\npainted brown, with a small but brilliant and tasteful garden in front\nand down either side. To the right of the door was an unobtrusive\nblack-and-gold sign bearing the words “Ferdinand Schulze, M.D.” He rang,\nwas admitted by a pretty, plump, Saxon-blond young woman–the doctor’s\nyounger daughter and housekeeper. She looked freshly clean and\nwholesome–and so useful! Hiram’s eyes rested upon her approvingly; and\noften afterwards his thoughts returned to her, lingering upon her and his\nown daughter in that sort of vague comparisons which we would not\nentertain were we aware of them.",
        "Dr. Schulze was the most distinguished–indeed, the only\ndistinguished–physician in Saint X. He was a short, stout, grizzled,\nspectacled man, with a nose like a scarlet button and a mouth like a\nbuttonhole; in speech he was abrupt, and, on the slightest pretext or no\npretext at all, sharp; he hid a warm sympathy for human nature,\nespecially for its weaknesses, behind an uncompromising candor which he\nregarded as the duty of the man of science toward a vain and deluded race\nthat knew little and learned reluctantly. A man is either better or worse\nthan the manner he chooses for purposes of conciliating or defying the\nworld. Dr. Schulze was better, as much better as his mind was superior to\nhis body. He and his motherless daughters were “not in it” socially.\nSaint X was not quite certain whether it shunned them or they it. His\nservices were sought only in extremities, partly because he would lie to\nhis patients neither when he knew what ailed them nor when he did not,\nand partly because he was a militant infidel. He lost no opportunity to\nattack religion in all its forms; and his two daughters let no\nopportunity escape to show that they stood with their father, whom\nthey adored, and who had brought them up with his heart. It was Dr.\nSchulze’s furious unbelief, investing him with a certain suggestion of\nSatan-got intelligence, that attracted Saint X to him in serious\nillnesses–somewhat as the Christian princes of mediaeval Europe\ntolerated and believed in the Jew physicians. Saint X was only just\nreaching the stage at which it could listen to “higher criticism” without\ndread lest the talk should be interrupted by a bolt from “special\nProvidence\"; the fact that Schulze lived on, believing and talking as he\ndid, could be explained only as miraculous and mysterious forbearance in\nwhich Satan must somehow have direct part.",
        "“I didn’t expect to see you for many a year yet,” said Schulze, as\nHiram, standing, faced him sitting at his desk.",
        "The master workman grew still more pallid as he heard the thought that\nweighted him in secret thus put into words. “I have never had a doctor\nbefore in my life,” said he. “My prescription has been, when you feel\nbadly stop eating and work harder.”",
        "“Starve and sweat–none better,” said Schulze. “Well, why do you come\nhere to-day?”",
        "“This morning I lifted a rather heavy weight. I’ve felt a kind of\ntiredness ever since, and a pain in the lower part of my back–pretty\nbad. I can’t understand it.”",
        "“But I can–that’s my business. Take off your clothes and stretch\nyourself on this chair. Call me when you’re ready.”",
        "Schulze withdrew into what smelled like a laboratory. Hiram could hear\nhim rattling glass against glass and metal, could smell the fumes of\nuncorked bottles of acids. When he called, Schulze reappeared, disposed\ninstruments and tubes upon a table. “I never ask my patients questions,\"\nhe said, as he began to examine Hiram’s chest. “I lay ’em out here and go\nover ’em inch by inch. I find all the weak spots, both those that are\ncrying out and those worse ones that don’t. I never ask a man what’s the\nmatter; I tell him. And my patients, and all the fools in this town,\nthink I’m in league with the devil. A doctor who finds out what’s the\nmatter with a man Providence is trying to lay in the grave–what can it\nbe but the devil?”",
        "He had reached his subject; as he worked he talked it–religion, its\nfolly, its silliness, its cruelty, its ignorance, its viciousness. Hiram\nlistened without hearing; he was absorbed in observing the diagnosis. He\nknew nothing of medicine, but he did know good workmanship. As the\nphysician worked, his admiration and confidence grew. He began to feel\nbetter–not physically better, but that mental relief which a courageous\nman feels when the peril he is facing is stripped of the mystery that\nmade it a terror. After perhaps three quarters of an hour, Schulze\nwithdrew to the laboratory, saying: “That’s all. You may dress.”",
        "Hiram dressed, seated himself. By chance he was opposite a huge image\nfrom the Orient, a hideous, twisted thing with a countenance of sardonic\nsagacity. As he looked he began to see perverse, insidious resemblances\nto the physician himself. When Schulze reappeared and busied himself\nwriting, he looked from the stone face to the face of flesh with\nfascinated repulsion–the man and the “familiar” were so ghastly alike.\nThen he suddenly understood that this was a quaint double jest of the\neccentric physician’s–his grim fling at his lack of physical charm, his\nironic jeer at the superstitions of Saint X.",
        "“There!” said Schulze, looking up. “That’s the best I can do for you.”",
        "“What’s the matter with me?”",
        "“You wouldn’t know if I told you.”",
        "“Is it serious?”",
        "“In this world everything is serious–and nothing.”",
        "“Will I die?”",
        "Schulze slowly surveyed all Hiram’s outward signs of majesty that had\nbeen denied his own majestic intellect, noted the tremendous figure, the\nshoulders, the forehead, the massive brow and nose and chin–an\nensemble of unabused power, the handiwork of Nature at her best, a\ncreation worth while, worth preserving intact and immortal.",
        "“Yes,” he answered, with satiric bitterness; “you will have to die, and\nrot, just like the rest of us.”",
        "“Tell me!” Hiram commanded. “Will I die soon?”",
        "Schulze reflected, rubbing his red-button nose with his stubby fingers.\nWhen he spoke, his voice had a sad gentleness. “You can bear hearing it.\nYou have the right to know.” He leaned back, paused, said in a low tone:\n\"Put your house in order, Mr. Ranger.”",
        "Hiram’s steadfast gray eyes met bravely the eyes of the man who had just\nread him his death warrant. A long pause; then Hiram said “Thank you,” in\nhis quiet, calm way.",
        "He took the prescriptions, went out into the street. It looked strange to\nhim; he felt like a stranger in that town where he had spent half a\ncentury–felt like a temporary tenant of that vast, strong body of his\nwhich until now had seemed himself. And he–or was it the stranger within\nhim?–kept repeating: “Put your house in order. Put your house in order.”",
        "At the second turning Arthur rounded the tandem out of Jefferson Street\ninto Willow with a skill that delighted both him and his sister. “But why\ngo that way?” said she. “Why not through Monroe street? I’m sure the\nhorses would behave.”",
        "“Better not risk it,” replied Arthur, showing that he, too, had had, but\nhad rejected, the temptation to parade the crowded part of town. “Even if\nthe horses didn’t act up, the people might, they’re such jays.”",
        "Adelaide’s estimate of what she and her brother had acquired in the East\nwas as high as was his, and she had the same unflattering opinion of\nthose who lacked it. But it ruffled her to hear him call the home folks\njays–just as it would have ruffled him had she been the one to make the\nslighting remark. “If you invite people’s opinion,” said she, “you’ve no\nright to sneer at them because they don’t say what you wanted.”",
        "“But I’m not driving for show if you are,” he retorted, with a\ntestiness that was confession.",
        "“Don’t be silly,” was her answer. “You know you wouldn’t take all this\ntrouble on a desert island.”",
        "“Of course not,” he admitted, “but I don’t care for the opinion of any\nbut those capable of appreciating.”",
        "“And those capable of appreciating are only those who approve,” teased\nAdelaide. “Why drive tandem among these ’jays?’”",
        "“To keep my hand in,” replied he; and his adroit escape restored his\ngood humor.",
        "“I wish I were as free from vanity as you are, Arthur, dear,” said she.",
        "“You’re just as fond of making a sensation as I am,” replied he. “And,\nmy eye, Del! but you do know how.” This with an admiring glance at\nher most becoming hat with its great, gracefully draped chiffon veil,\nand at her dazzling white dust-coat with its deep blue facings that\nmatched her eyes.",
        "She laughed. “Just wait till you see my new dresses–and hats.”",
        "“Another shock for your poor father.”",
        "“Shock of joy.”",
        "“Yes,” assented Arthur, rather glumly; “he’ll take anything off you.\nBut when I–”",
        "“It’s no compliment to me,” she cut in, the prompter to admit the truth\nbecause it would make him feel better. “He thinks I’m ’only a woman,’\nfit for nothing but to look pretty as long as I’m a girl, and then to\ndevote myself to a husband and children, without any life or even ideas\nof my own.”",
        "“Mother always seems cheerful enough,” said Arthur. His content with the\nchanged conditions which the prosperity and easy-going generosity of the\nelder generation were making for the younger generation ended at his own\nsex. The new woman–idle and frivolous, ignorant of all useful things,\nfit only for the show side of life and caring only for it, discontented\nwith everybody but her own selfish self–Arthur had a reputation among\nhis friends for his gloomy view of the American woman and for his courage\nin expressing it.",
        "“You are so narrow-minded, Artie!” his sister exclaimed impatiently.\n\"Mother was brought up very differently from the way she and father have\nbrought me up–”",
        "“Have let you bring yourself up.”",
        "“No matter; I am different.”",
        "“But what would you do? What can a woman do?”",
        "“I don’t know,” she admitted. “But I do know I hate a humdrum life.\"\nThere was the glint of the Ranger will in her eyes as she added:\n\"Furthermore, I shan’t stand for it.”",
        "He looked at her enviously. “You’ll be free in another year,” he said.\n\"You and Ross Whitney will marry, and you’ll have a big house in Chicago\nand can do what you please and go where you please.”",
        "“Not if Ross should turn out to be the sort of man you are.”",
        "He laughed. “I can see Ross–or any man–trying to manage you! You’ve\ngot too much of father in you.”",
        "“But I’ll be dependent until–” Adelaide paused, then added a\nsatisfactorily vague, “for a long time. Father won’t give me anything.\nHow furious he’d be at the very suggestion of dowry. Parents out here\ndon’t appreciate that conditions have changed and that it’s necessary\nnowadays for a woman to be independent of her husband.”",
        "Arthur compressed his lips, to help him refrain from comment. But he felt\nso strongly on the subject that he couldn’t let her remarks pass\nunchallenged. “I don’t know about that, Del,” he said. “It depends on the\nwoman. Personally, I’d hate to be married to a woman I couldn’t control\nif necessary.”",
        "“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” cried Del, indignant. “Is thatyour idea of control–to make a woman mercenary and hypocritical? You’d\nbetter change your way of thinking if you don’t want Janet to be very\nunhappy, and yourself, too.”",
        "“That sounds well,” he retorted, “but you know better. Take our case, for\ninstance. Is it altogether love and affection that make us so cautious\nabout offending father?”",
        "“Speak for yourself,” said Adelaide. ’I’m not cautious.”",
        "“Do try to argue fair, even if you are a woman. You’re as cautious in\nyour way as I am in mine.”",
        "Adelaide felt that he was offended, and justly. “I didn’t mean quite what\nI said, Artie. You are cautious, in a way, and sometimes. But often\nyou’re reckless. I’m frightened every once in a while by it, and I’m\nhaunted by the dread that there’ll be a collision between father and you.\nYou’re so much alike, and you understand each other less and less, all\nthe time.”",
        "After a silence Arthur said, thoughtfully: “I think I understand him.\nThere are two distinct persons inside of me. There’s the one that was\nmade by inheritance and by my surroundings as a boy–the one that’s like\nhim, the one that enables me to understand him. Then, there’s this other\nthat’s been made since–in the East, and going round among people that\neither never knew the sort of life we had as children or have grown away\nfrom it. The problem is how to reconcile those two persons so that\nthey’ll stop wrangling and shaming each other. That’s my problem, I\nmean. Father’s problem–He doesn’t know he has one. I must do as he\nwishes or I’ll not be at all, so far as he is concerned.”",
        "Another and longer silence; then Adelaide, after an uneasy, affectionate\nlook at his serious profile, said: “I’m often ashamed of myself,\nArtie–about father; I don’t think I’m a hypocrite, for I do love him\ndearly. Who could help it, when he is so indulgent and when even in his\nanger he’s kind? But you–Oh, Artie, even though you are less, much less,\nuncandid with him than I am, still isn’t it more–more–less manly in\nyou? After all, I’m a woman and helpless; and, if I seriously offend him,\nwhat would become of me? But you’re a man. The world was made for men;\nthey can make their own way. And it seems unworthy of you to be afraid to\nbe yourself before anybody. And I’m sure it’s demoralizing.”",
        "She spoke so sincerely that he could not have resented it, even had her\nwords raised a far feebler echo within him. “I don’t honestly believe,\nDel, that my caution with father is from fear of his shutting down on me,\nany more than yours is,” he replied. “I know he cares for me. And often I\ndon’t let him see me as I am simply because it’d hurt him if he knew how\ndifferently I think and feel about a lot of things.”",
        "“But are you right?–or is he?”",
        "Arthur did not answer immediately. He had forgotten his horses; they were\njogging along, heads down and “form” gone. “What do you think?” he\nfinally asked.",
        "“I–I can’t quite make up my mind.”",
        "“Do you think I ought to drudge and slave, as he has? Do you think I\nought to spend my life in making money, in dealing in flour? Isn’t there\nsomething better than that?”",
        "“I don’t think it’s what a man deals in; I think it’s how he deals.\nAnd I don’t believe there’s any sort of man finer and better than\nfather, Arthur.”",
        "“That’s true,” he assented warmly. “I used to envy the boys at\ncollege–some of them–because their fathers and mothers had so much\nculture and knowledge of the world. But when I came to know their\nparents better–and them, too–I saw how really ignorant and\nvulgar–yes, vulgar–they were, under their veneer of talk and manner\nwhich they thought was everything. ’They may be fit to stand before\nkings’ I said to myself, ’but my father is a king–and of a sort they\nain’t fit to stand before.’”",
        "The color was high in Del’s cheeks and her eyes were brilliant. “You’ll\ncome out all right, Artie,” said she. “I don’t know just how, but you’ll\ndo something, and do it well.”",
        "“I’d much rather do nothing–well,” said he lightly, as if not sure\nwhether he was in earnest or not. “It’s so much nicer to dream than to\ndo.” He looked at her with good-humored satire. “And you–what’s the\nmatter with your practising some of the things you preach? Why don’t you\nmarry–say, Dory Hargrave, instead of Ross?”",
        "She made a failure of a stout attempt to meet his eyes and to smile\neasily. “Because I don’t love Dory Hargrave,” she said.",
        "“But you wouldn’t let yourself if you could–would you, now?”",
        "“It’s a poor love that lags for let,” she replied. “Besides, why talk\nabout me? I’m ’only a woman.’ I haven’t any career, or any chance to\nmake one.”",
        "“But you might help some man,” he teased.",
        "“Then you’d like me to marry Dory–if I could?”",
        "“I’m just showing you how vain your theorizing is,” was his not\naltogether frank reply. “You urge me to despise money when you\nyourself–”",
        "“That isn’t fair, Arthur. If I didn’t care for Ross I shouldn’t think of\nmarrying him, and you know it.”",
        "“He’s so like father!” mocked Arthur.",
        "“No, but he’s so like you,” she retorted. “You know he was your ideal\nfor years. It was your praising him that–that first made me glad to do\nas father and mother wished. You know father approves of him.”",
        "Arthur grinned, and Del colored. “A lot father knows about Ross as he\nreally is,” said he. “Oh, he’s clever about what he lets father see.\nHowever, you do admit there’s some other ideal of man than successful\nworkingman.”",
        "“Of course!” said Adelaide. “I’m not so silly and narrow as you try to\nmake out. Only, I prefer a combination of the two. And I think Ross is\nthat, and I hope and believe he’ll be more so–afterwards.”",
        "Adelaide’s tone was so judicial that Arthur thought it discreet not to\ndiscuss his friend and future brother-in-law further. “He isn’t good\nenough for Del,” he said to himself. “But, then, who is? And he’ll\nhelp her to the sort of setting she’s best fitted for. What side\nthey’ll put on, once they get going! She’ll set a new pace–and it’ll\nbe a grand one.”",
        "At the top of the last curve in the steep road up from Deer Creek the\nhorses halted of themselves to rest; Arthur and his sister gazed out upon\nthe vast, dreamy vision–miles on miles of winding river shimmering\nthrough its veil of silver mist, stately hills draped in gauziest blue.\nIt was such uplifting vistas that inspired the human imagination, in the\ndays of its youth, to breathe a soul into the universe and make it a\nliving thing, palpitant with love and hope; it was an outlook that would\nhave moved the narrowest, the smallest, to think in the wide and the\nlarge. Wherever the hills were not based close to the water’s edge or\nrose less abruptly, there were cultivated fields; and in each field, far\nor near, men were at work. These broad-hatted, blue-shirted toilers in\nthe ardent sun determined the turn of Adelaide’s thoughts.",
        "“It doesn’t seem right, does it,” said she, “that so many–almost\neverybody–should have to work so hard just to get enough to eat and to\nwear and a place to sleep, when there’s so much of everything in the\nworld–and when a few like us don’t have to work at all and have much\nmore than they need, simply because one happened to be born in such or\nsuch conditions. I suppose it’s got to be so, but it certainly looks\nunjust–and silly.”",
        "“I’m not sure the workers haven’t the best of it,” replied Arthur. “They\nhave the dinner; we have only the dessert; and I guess one gets tired of\nonly desserts, no matter how great the variety.”",
        "“It’s a stupid world in lots of ways, isn’t it?”",
        "“Not so stupid as it used to be, when everybody said and thought it was\nas good as possible,” replied he. “You see, it’s the people in the world\nthat make it stupid. For instance, do you suppose you and I, or anybody,\nwould care for idling about and doing all sorts of things our better\njudgment tells us are inane, if it weren’t that most of our fellow-beings\nare stupid enough to admire and envy that sort of thing, and that we are\nstupid enough to want to be admired and envied by stupid people?”",
        "“Did you notice the Sandys’s English butler?” asked Adelaide.",
        "“Did I? I’ll bet he keeps every one in the Sandys family up to\nthe mark.”",
        "“That’s it,” continued Adelaide. “He’s a poor creature, dumb and\nignorant. He knows only one thing–snobbishness. Yet every one of us was\nin terror of his opinion. No doubt kings feel the same way about the\npeople around them. Always what’s expected of us–and by whom? Why, by\npeople who have little sense and less knowledge. They run the world,\ndon’t they?”",
        "“As Dory Hargrave says,” said her brother, “the only scheme for making\nthings better that’s worth talking about is raising the standards of the\nmasses because their standards are ours. We’ll be fools and unjust as\nlong as they’ll let us. And they’ll let us as long as they’re ignorant.”",
        "By inheritance Arthur and Adelaide had excellent minds, shrewd and with\nthat cast of humor which makes for justice of judgment by mocking at the\nsolemn frauds of interest and prejudice. But, as is often the case with\nthe children of the rich and the well-to-do, there had been no necessity\nfor either to use intellect; their parents and hirelings of various\ndegrees, paid with their father’s generously given money, had done their\nthinking for them. The whole of animate creation is as lazy as it dares\nbe, and man is no exception. Thus, the Ranger children, like all other\nnormal children of luxury, rarely made what would have been, for their\nfallow minds, the arduous exertion of real thinking. When their minds\nwere not on pastimes or personalities they were either rattling round in\ntheir heads or exchanging the ideas, real and reputed, that happened to\nbe drifting about, at the moment, in their “set.” Those ideas they and\ntheir friends received, and stored up or passed on with never a thought\nas to whether they were true or false, much as they used coins or notes\nthey took in and paid out. Arthur and Adelaide soon wearied of their\ngroping about in the mystery of human society–how little direct interest\nit had for them then! They drove on; the vision which had stimulated them\nto think vanished; they took up again those personalities about friends,\nacquaintances and social life that are to thinking somewhat as massage is\nto exercise–all the motions of real activity, but none of its spirit.\nThey stopped for two calls and tea on the fashionable Bluffs.",
        "When they reached home, content with tandem, drive, themselves, their\nfriends, and life in general, they found Hiram Ranger returned from work,\nthough it was only half-past five, and stretched on the sofa in the\nsitting room, with his eyes shut. At this unprecedented spectacle of\ninactivity they looked at each other in vague alarm; they were stealing\naway, when he called: “I’m not asleep.”",
        "His expression made Adelaide impulsively kneel beside him and gaze\nanxiously into his face. He smiled, roused himself to a sitting posture,\nwell concealing the effort the exertion cost him.",
        "“Your father’s getting old,” he said, hiding his tragedy of aching body\nand aching heart and impending doom in a hypocrisy of cheerfulness that\nwould have passed muster even had he not been above suspicion. “I’m not\nup to the mark of the last generation. Your grandfather was fifty when I\nwas born, and he didn’t die till I was fifty.”",
        "His face shadowed; Adelaide, glancing round for the cause, saw Simeon,\nhalf-sitting, half-standing in the doorway, humble apology on his\nweazened, whiskered face. He looked so like her memory-picture of her\ngrandfather that she burst out laughing. “Don’t be hard on the poor old\ngentleman, father,” she cried. “How can you resist that appeal? Tell him\nto come in and make himself at home.”",
        "As her father did not answer, she glanced at him. He had not heard her;\nhe was staring straight ahead with an expression of fathomless\nmelancholy. The smile faded from her face, from her heart, as the light\nfades before the oncoming shadow of night. Presently he was\nabsent-mindedly but tenderly stroking her hair, as if he were thinking of\nher so intensely that he had become unconscious of her physical presence.\nThe apparition of Simeon had set him to gathering in gloomy assembly a\nvast number of circumstances about his two children; each circumstance\nwas so trivial in itself that by itself it seemed foolishly\ninconsequential; yet, in the mass, they bore upon his heart, upon his\nconscience, so heavily that his very shoulders stooped with the weight.\n\"Put your house in order,” the newcomer within him was solemnly warning;\nand Hiram was puzzling over his meaning, was dreading what that meaning\nmight presently reveal itself to be. “Put my house in order?” muttered\nHiram, an inquiring echo of that voice within.",
        "“What did you say, father?” asked Adelaide, timidly laying her hand on\nhis arm. Though she knew he was simple, she felt the vastness in him that\nwas awe-inspiring–just as a mountain or an ocean, a mere aggregation of\nsimple matter, is in the total majestic and incomprehensible. Beside him,\nthe complex little individualities among her acquaintances seemed like\nthe acrostics of a children’s puzzle column.",
        "“Leave me with your brother awhile,” he said.",
        "She glanced quickly, furtively at Arthur and admired his\nself-possession–for she knew his heart must be heavier than her own. She\nrose from her knees, laid her hand lingeringly, appealingly upon her\nfather’s broad shoulder, then slowly left the room. Simeon, forgotten,\nlooked up at her and scratched his head; he turned in behind her, caught\nthe edge of her skirt and bore it like a queen’s page.",
        "The son watched the father, whose powerful features were set in an\nexpression that seemed stern only because his eyes were hid, gazing\nsteadily at the floor. It was the father who broke the silence. “What do\nyou calculate to do–now?”",
        "“Tutor this summer and have another go at those exams in September. I’ll\nhave no trouble in rejoining my class. I sailed just a little too close\nto the wind–that’s all.”",
        "“What does that mean?” inquired the father. College was a mystery to\nhim, a deeply respected mystery. He had been the youngest of four sons.\nTheir mother’s dream was the dream of all the mothers of those pioneer\nand frontier days–to send her sons to college. Each son in turn had,\nwith her assistance, tried to get together the sum–so small, yet so\nhugely large–necessary to make the start. But fate, now as sickness,\nnow as crop failure, now as flood, and again as war, had been too\nstrong for them. Hiram had come nearest, and his defeat had broken his\nmother’s heart and almost broken his own. It was therefore with a sense\nof prying into hallowed mysteries that he began to investigate his\nson’s college career.",
        "“Well, you know,” Arthur proceeded to explain; “there are five\ngrades–A, B, C, D, and E. I aimed for C, but several things came\nup–interfered–and I–just missed D.”",
        "“Is C the highest?”",
        "Arthur smiled faintly. “Well–not in one sense. It’s what’s called the\ngentleman’s grade. All the fellows that are the right sort are in\nit–or in D.”",
        "“And what did you get?”",
        "“I got E. That means I have to try again.”",
        "Hiram began to understand. So this was the hallowed mystery of higher\neducation. He was sitting motionless, his elbows on his knees, his big\nchest and shoulders inclined forward, his gaze fixed upon a wreath of red\nroses in the pattern of the moquette carpet–that carpet upon which\nAdelaide, backed by Arthur, had waged vain war as the worst of the many,\nto cultured nerves, trying exhibitions of “primitive taste” in Ellen’s\nbest rooms. When Hiram spoke his lips barely opened and his voice had no\nexpression. His next question was: “What does A mean?”",
        "“The A men are those that keep their noses in their books. They’re a\nnarrow set–have no ideas–think the book side is the only side of a\ncollege education.”",
        "“Then you don’t go to college to learn what’s in the books?”",
        "“Oh, of course, the books are part of it. But the real thing is\nassociation–the friendships one makes, the knowledge of human nature and\nof–of life.”",
        "“What does that mean?”",
        "Arthur had been answering Hiram’s questions in a flurry, though he had\nbeen glib enough. He had had no fear that his father would appreciate\nthat he was getting half-truths, or, rather, truths prepared skillfully\nfor paternal consumption; his flurry had come from a sense that he was\nhimself not doing quite the manly, the courageous thing. Now, however,\nsomething in the tone of the last question, or, perhaps, some element\nthat was lacking, roused in him a suspicion of depth in his simple\nunworldly father; and swift upon this awakening came a realization that\nhe was floundering in that depth–and in grave danger of submersion. He\nshifted nervously when his father, without looking up and without putting\nany expression into his voice, repeated: “What do you mean by\nassociations–and life–and–all that?”",
        "“I can’t explain exactly,” replied Arthur. “It would take a long time.”",
        "“I haven’t asked you to be brief.”",
        "“I can’t put it into words.”",
        "“Why not?”",
        "“You would misunderstand.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "Arthur made no reply.",
        "“Then you can’t tell me what you go to college for?”",
        "Again the young man looked perplexedly at his father. There was no anger\nin that tone–no emotion of any kind. But what was the meaning of the\nlook, the look of a sorrow that was tragic?",
        "“I know you think I’ve disgraced you, father, and myself,” said Arthur.\n\"But it isn’t so–really, it isn’t. No one, not even the faculty, thinks\nthe less of me. This sort of thing often occurs in our set.”",
        "“Your ’set’?”",
        "“Among the fellows I travel with. They’re the nicest men in Harvard.\nThey’re in all the best clubs–and lead in supporting the athletics\nand–and–their fathers are among the richest, the most distinguished men\nin the country. There are only about twenty or thirty of us, and we make\nthe pace for the whole show–the whole university, I mean. Everybody\nadmires and envies us–wants to be in our set. Even the grinds look up to\nus, and imitate us as far as they can. We give the tone to the\nuniversity!”",
        "“What is ’the tone’?”",
        "Again Arthur shifted uneasily. “It’s hard to explain that sort of\nthing. It’s a sort of–of manner. It’s knowing how to do the–the right\nsort of thing.”",
        "“What is the right sort of thing?”",
        "“I can’t put it into words. It’s what makes you look at one man and say,\n’He’s a gentleman’; and look at another and see that he isn’t.”",
        "“What is a ’gentleman’–at Harvard?”",
        "“Just what it is anywhere.”",
        "“What is it anywhere?”",
        "Again Arthur was silent.",
        "“Then there are only twenty or thirty gentlemen at Harvard? And the\ncatalogue says there are three thousand or more students.”",
        "“Oh–of course,” began Arthur. But he stopped short.",
        "How could he make his father, ignorant of “the world” and dominated by\nprimitive ideas, understand the Harvard ideal? So subtle and evanescent,\nso much a matter of the most delicate shadings was this ideal that he\nhimself often found the distinction quite hazy between it and that which\nlooked disquietingly like “tommy rot.”",
        "“And these gentlemen–these here friends of yours–your ’set,’ as you\ncall ’em–what are they aiming for?”",
        "Arthur did not answer. It would be hopeless to try to make Hiram Ranger\nunderstand, still less tolerate, an ideal of life that was elegant\nleisure, the patronage of literature and art, music, the drama, the turf,\nand the pursuit of culture and polite extravagance, wholly aloof from the\nfrenzied and vulgar jostling of the market place.",
        "With a mighty heave of the shoulders which, if it had found outward\nrelief, would have been a sigh, Hiram Ranger advanced to the hard part of\nthe first task which the mandate, “Put your house in order,” had set for\nhim. He took from the inside pocket of his coat a small bundle of papers,\nthe records of Arthur’s college expenses. The idea of accounts with his\nchildren had been abhorrent to him. The absolute necessity of business\nmethod had forced him to make some records, and these he had expected to\ndestroy without anyone but himself knowing of their existence. But in the\nnew circumstances he felt he must not let his own false shame push the\nyoung man still farther from the right course. Arthur watched him open\neach paper in the bundle slowly, spread it out and, to put off the\nhateful moment for speech, pretend to peruse it deliberately before\nlaying it on his knee; and, dim though the boy’s conception of his father\nwas, he did not misjudge the feelings behind that painful reluctance.\nHiram held the last paper in a hand that trembled. He coughed, made\nseveral attempts to speak, finally began: “Your first year at Harvard,\nyou spent seventeen hundred dollars. Your second year, you spent\nfifty-three hundred. Last year–Are all your bills in?”",
        "“There are a few–” murmured Arthur.",
        "“How much?”",
        "He flushed hotly.",
        "“Don’t you know?” With this question his father lifted his eyes without\nlifting his shaggy eyebrows.",
        "“About four or five thousand–in all–including the tailors and other\ntradespeople.”",
        "A pink spot appeared in the left cheek of the old man–very bright\nagainst the gray-white of his skin. Somehow, he did not like that word\n\"tradespeople,” though it seemed harmless enough. “This last year, the\ntotal was,” said he, still monotonously, “ninety-eight hundred odd–if\nthe bills I haven’t got yet ain’t more than five thousand.”",
        "“A dozen men spend several times that much,” protested Arthur.",
        "“What for?” inquired Hiram.",
        "“Not for dissipation, father,” replied the young man, eagerly.\n\"Dissipation is considered bad form in our set.”",
        "“What do you mean by dissipation?”",
        "“Drinking–and–all that sort of thing,” Arthur replied. “It’s considered\nungentlemanly, nowadays–drinking to excess, I mean.”",
        "“What do you spend the money for?”",
        "“For good quarters and pictures, and patronizing the sports, and\nclub dues, and entertainments, and things to drive in–for living as\na man should.”",
        "“You’ve spent a thousand, three hundred dollars for tutoring since you’ve\nbeen there.”",
        "“Everybody has to do tutoring–more or less.”",
        "“What did you do with the money you made?”",
        "“What money, father?”",
        "“The money you made tutoring. You said everybody had to do tutoring. I\nsuppose you did your share.”",
        "Arthur did not smile at this “ignorance of the world\"; he grew red, and\nstammered: “Oh, I meant everybody in our set employs tutors.”",
        "“Then who does the tutoring? Who’re the nobodies that tutor the\neverybodies?”",
        "Arthur grew cold, then hot. He was cornered, therefore roused. He stood,\nleaned against the table, faced his father defiantly. “I see what you’re\ndriving at, father,” he said. “You feel I’ve wasted time and money at\ncollege, because I haven’t lived like a dog and grubbed in books day in\nand day out, and filled my head with musty stuff; because I’ve tried to\nget what I believe to be the broadest knowledge and experience; because\nI’ve associated with the best men, the fellows that come from the good\nfamilies. You accept the bluff the faculty puts up of pretending the A\nfellows are really the A fellows, when, in fact, everybody there and all\nthe graduates and everyone everywhere who knows the world knows that the\nfellows in our set are the ones the university is proud of–the fellows\nwith manners and appearance and–”",
        "“The gentlemen,” interjected the father, who had not changed either his\nposition or his expression.",
        "“Yes–the gentlemen!” exclaimed Arthur. “There are other ideals of life\nbesides buying and selling.”",
        "“And working?” suggested Hiram.",
        "“Yes–and what you call working,” retorted Arthur, angry through and\nthrough. “You sent me East to college to get the education of a man in my\nposition.”",
        "“What is your position?” inquired Hiram–simply an inquiry.",
        "“Your son,” replied the young man; “trying to make the best use of the\nopportunities you’ve worked so hard to get for me. I’m not you, father.\nYou’d despise me if I didn’t have a character, an individuality, of my\nown. Yet, because I can’t see life as you see it, you are angry with me.”",
        "For answer Hiram only heaved his great shoulders in another suppressed\nsigh. He knew profoundly that he was right, yet his son’s\nplausibilities–they could only be plausibilities–put him clearly in the\nwrong. “We’ll see,” he said; “we’ll see. You’re wrong in thinking I’m\nangry, boy.” He was looking at his son now, and his eyes made his son’s\npassion vanish. He got up and went to the young man and laid his hand on\nhis shoulder in a gesture of affection that moved the son the more\nprofoundly because it was unprecedented. “If there’s been any wrong\ndone,” said the old man–and he looked very, very old now–\"I’ve done it.\nI’m to blame–not you.”",
        "A moment after Hiram left the room, Adelaide hurried in. A glance at her\nbrother reassured her. They stood at the window watching their father as\nhe walked up and down the garden, his hands behind his back, his\nshoulders stooped, his powerful head bent.",
        "“Was he very angry?” asked Del.",
        "“He wasn’t angry at all,” her brother replied. “I’d much rather he had\nbeen.” Then, after a pause, he added: “I thought the trouble between us\nwas that, while I understood him, he didn’t understand me. Now I know\nthat he has understood me but that I don’t understand him\"–and, after a\npause–\"or myself.”",
        "As Hiram had always been silent and seemingly abstracted, no one but\nEllen noted the radical change in him. She had brought up her children in\nthe old-fashioned way–her thoughts, and usually her eyes, upon them all\nday, and one ear open all night. When she no longer had them to guard,\nshe turned all this energy of solicitude to her husband; thus the\npassionate love of her youth was having a healthy, beautiful old age. The\nyears of circumventing the easily roused restiveness of her spirited boy\nand girl had taught her craft; without seeming to be watching Hiram, no\ndetail of his appearance or actions escaped her.",
        "“There’s mighty little your pa don’t see,” had been one of her stock\nobservations to the children from their earliest days. “And you needn’t\nflatter yourselves he don’t care because he don’t speak.” Now she noted\nthat from under his heavy brows his eyes were looking stealthily out,\nmore minutely observant than ever before, and that what he saw either\nadded to his sadness or took a color of sadness from his mood. She\nguessed that the actions of Adelaide and Arthur, so utterly different\nfrom the actions of the children of her and Hiram’s young days–except\nthose regarded by all worth-while people as “trifling and trashy\"–had\nsomething to do with Hiram’s gloom. She decided that Arthur’s failure and\nhis lightness of manner in face of it were the chief trouble–this until\nHiram’s shoulders began to stoop and hollows to appear in his cheeks and\nunder his ears, and a waxlike pallor to overspread his face. Then she\nknew that he was not well physically; and, being a practical woman, she\ndismissed the mental causes of the change. “People talk a lot about their\nmental troubles,” she said to herself, “but it’s usually three-fourths\nstomach and liver.”",
        "As Hiram and illness, real illness, could not be associated in her mind,\nshe gave the matter no importance until she heard him sigh heavily one\nnight, after they had been in bed several hours. “What is it, father?\"\nshe asked.",
        "There was no answer, but a return to an imitation of the regular\nbreathing of a sleeper.",
        "“Hiram,” she insisted, “what is it?”",
        "“Nothing, Ellen, nothing,” he answered; “I must have ate something that\ndon’t sit quite right.”",
        "“You didn’t take no supper at all,” said she.",
        "This reminded him how useless it was to try to deceive her. “I ain’t been\nfeeling well of late,” he confessed, “but it’ll soon be over.” He did not\nsee the double meaning of his words until he had uttered them; he stirred\nuneasily in his dread that she would suspect. “I went to the doctor.”",
        "“What did he say?–though I don’t know why I should ask what such a fool\nas Milbury said about anything.”",
        "“I got some medicine,” replied he, evading telling her what doctor.",
        "Instantly she sat up in bed. “I haven’t seen you take no drugs!” she\nexclaimed. Drugs were her especial abhorrence. She let no one in the\nfamily take any until she had passed upon them.",
        "“I didn’t want to make a fuss,” he explained.",
        "“Where is it?” she demanded, on the edge of the bed now, ready to rise.",
        "“I’ll show it to you in the morning, mother. Lie down and go to sleep.\nI’ve been awake long enough.”",
        "“Where is it?” she repeated, and he heard her moving across the room\ntoward the gas fixture.",
        "“In my vest pocket. It’s a box of pills. You can’t tell nothin’\nabout it.”",
        "She lit the gas and went to his waistcoat, hanging where it always hung\nat night–on a hook beside the closet door. He watched her fumble\nthrough the pockets, watched her take her spectacles from the corner of\nthe mantel and put them on, the bridge well down toward the end of her\nnose. A not at all romantic figure she made, standing beside the\nsputtering gas jet, her spectacles balanced on her nose, her thin neck\nand forearms exposed, and her old face studying the lid of the pill box\nheld in her toil- and age-worn hands. The box dropped from her fingers\nand rolled along the floor. He saw an awful look slowly creep over her\nfeatures as the terrible thought crept over her mind. As she began to\nturn her face toward him, with a motion of the head like that of a\nmachine on unoiled bearings, he closed his eyes; but he felt her\nlooking at him.",
        "“Dr. Schulze!” she said, an almost soundless breathing of the name that\nalways meant the last resort in mortal illness.",
        "He was trying to think of lies to tell her, but he could think of\nnothing. The sense of light upon his eyelids ceased. He presently felt\nher slowly getting into bed. A pall-like silence; then upon his cheek, in\nlong discontinued caress, a hand whose touch was as light and soft as the\nfall of a rose leaf–the hand of love that toil and age cannot make\nharsh, and her fingers were wet with her tears. Thus they lay in the\ndarkness and silence, facing together the tragedy of the eternal\nseparation.",
        "“What did he say, dearest?” she asked. She had not used that word to him\nsince the first baby came and they began to call each other “father” and\n\"mother.” All these years the children had been between them, and each\nhad held the other important chiefly as related to them. Now it was as\nin their youth–just he and she, so close that only death could come\nbetween them.",
        "“It’s a long way off,” said Hiram. He would not set ringing in her ears\nthat knell which was clanging to him its solemn, incessant, menacing “Put\nyour house in order!”",
        "“Tell me what he said,” she urged gently.",
        "“He couldn’t make out exactly. The medicine’ll patch me up.”",
        "She did not insist–why fret him to confess what she knew the instant\nshe read “Schulze” on the box? After an hour she heard him breathing as\nonly a sleeper can breathe; but she watched on until morning. When they\nwere dressing, each looked at the other furtively from time to time, a\ngreat tenderness in his eyes, and in hers the anguish of a dread that\nmight not be spoken.",
        "On the day after Mrs. Whitney’s arrival for the summer, she descended in\nstate from the hills to call upon the Rangers.",
        "When the front bell rang Mrs. Ranger was in the kitchen–and was dressed\nfor the kitchen. As the “girl” still had not been replaced she answered\nthe door herself. In a gingham wrapper, with her glasses thrust up into\nher gray hair, she was facing a footman in livery.",
        "“Are Mrs. Ranger and Miss Ranger at home?” asked he, mistaking her for\na servant and eying her dishevelment with an expression which was not\nlost on her.",
        "She smiled with heartiest good nature. “Yes, I’m here–I’m Mrs.\nRanger,” said she; and she looked beyond him to the victoria in which\nsat Mrs. Whitney. “How d’ye do, Matilda?” she called. “Come right in.\nAs usual when the canneries are running, I’m my own upstairs girl. I\nreckon your young man here thinks I ought to discharge her and get one\nthat’s tidier.”",
        "“Your young man here” was stiffly touching the brim of his top hat and\nsaying: “Beg parding, ma’am.”",
        "“Oh, that’s all right,” replied Mrs. Ranger; “I am what I look to be!”",
        "Behind her now appeared Adelaide, her cheeks burning in mortification she\nwas ashamed of feeling and still more ashamed of being unable to conceal.\n\"Go and put on something else, mother,” she urged in an undertone; “I’ll\nlook after Mrs. Whitney till you come down.”",
        "“Ain’t got time,” replied her mother, conscious of what was in her\ndaughter’s mind and a little contemptuous and a little resentful of it.\n\"I guess Tilly Whitney will understand. If she don’t, why, I guess we can\nbear up under it.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney had left her carriage and was advancing up the steps. She\nwas a year older than Ellen Ranger; but so skillfully was she got\ntogether that, had she confessed to forty or even thirty-eight, one who\ndidn’t know would have accepted her statement as too cautious by hardly\nmore than a year or so. The indisputably artificial detail in her\nelegant appearance was her hair; its tinting, which had to be made\nstronger year by year as the gray grew more resolute, was reaching the\nstage of hard, rough-looking red. “Another year or two,” thought\nAdelaide, “and it’ll make her face older than she really is. Even now\nshe’s getting a tough look.”",
        "Matilda kissed Mrs. Ranger and Adelaide affectedly on both cheeks. “I’m\nso glad to find you in!” said she. “And you, poor dear\"–this to Mrs.\nRanger–\"are in agony over the servant question.” She glanced behind her\nto make sure the carriage had driven away. “I don’t know what we’re\ncoming to. I can’t keep a man longer than six months. Servants don’t\nappreciate a good home and good wages. As soon as a man makes\nacquaintances here he becomes independent and leaves. If something isn’t\ndone, the better class of people will have to move out of the country.”",
        "“Or go back to doing their own work,” said Mrs. Ranger.",
        "Mrs. Whitney smiled vaguely–a smile which said, “I’m too polite to\nanswer that remark as it deserves.”",
        "“Why didn’t you bring Jenny along?” inquired Mrs. Ranger, when they were\nin the “front parlor,” the two older women seated, Adelaide moving\nrestlessly about.",
        "“Janet and Ross haven’t come yet,” answered Mrs. Whitney. “They’ll be on\nnext week, but only for a little while. They both like it better in the\nEast. All their friends are there and there’s so much more to do.” Mrs.\nWhitney sighed; before her rose the fascination of all there was to “do\"\nin the East–the pleasures she was denying herself.",
        "“I don’t see why you don’t live in New York,” said Mrs. Ranger. “You’re\nalways talking about it.”",
        "“Oh, I can’t leave Charles!” was Mrs. Whitney’s answer. “Or, rather\nhe’d not hear of my doing it. But I think he’ll let us take an\napartment at Sherry’s next winter–for the season, just–unless Janet\nand I go abroad.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger had not been listening. She now started up. “If you’ll excuse\nme, Mattie, I must see what that cook’s about. I’m afraid to let her out\nof my sight for five minutes for fear she’ll up and leave.”",
        "“What a time your poor mother has!” said Mrs. Whitney, when she and\nAdelaide were alone.",
        "Del had recovered from her attack of what she had been denouncing to\nherself as snobbishness. For all the gingham wrapper and spectacles\nanchored in the hair and general air of hard work and no “culture,” she\nwas thinking, as she looked at Mrs. Whitney’s artificiality and listened\nto those affected accents, that she was glad her mother was Ellen Ranger\nand not Matilda Whitney. “But mother doesn’t believe she has a hard\ntime,” she answered, “and everything depends on what one believes\noneself; don’t you think so? I often envy her. She’s always busy and\ninterested. And she’s so useful, such a happiness-maker.”",
        "“I often feel that way, too,” responded Mrs. Whitney, in her most\nprofusely ornate ’grande dame” manner. “I get so bored with leading\nan artificial life. I often wish fate had been more kind to me. I was\nreading, the other day, that the Queen of England said she had the tastes\nof a dairy maid. Wasn’t that charming? Many of us whom fate has condemned\nto the routine of high station feel the same way.”",
        "It was by such deliverances that Mrs. Whitney posed, not without success,\nas an intellectual woman who despised the frivolities of a fashionable\nexistence–this in face of the obvious fact that she led a fashionable\nexistence, or, rather, it led her, from the moment her masseuseawakened her in the morning until her maid undressed her at night. But,\nalthough Adelaide was far too young, too inexperienced to know that\njudgment must always be formed from actions, never from words, she was\nnot, in this instance, deceived. “It takes more courage than most of us\nhave,” said she, “to do what we’d like instead of what vanity suggests.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney did not understand this beyond getting from it a vague sense\nthat she had somehow been thrust at. “You must be careful of that skin of\nyours, Adele,” she thrust back. “I’ve been looking at it. You can’t have\nbeen home long, yet the exposure to the sun is beginning to show. You\nhave one of those difficult, thin skins, and one’s skin is more than half\none’s beauty. You ought never to go out without a veil. The last thing\nRoss said to me was, ’Do tell Adelaide to keep her color down.’ You know\nhe admires the patrician style.”",
        "Adelaide could not conceal the effect of the shot. Her skin was a great\ntrial to her, it burned so easily; and she hated wrapping herself in\nunder broad brims and thick veils when the feeling of bareheadedness was\nso delightful. “At any rate,” said she sweetly, “it’s easier to keep\ncolor down than to keep it up.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney pretended not to hear. She was now at the window which gave\non the garden by way of a small balcony. “There’s your father!” she\nexclaimed; “let’s go to him.”",
        "There, indeed, was Hiram, pacing the walk along the end of the garden\nwith a ponderousness in the movements of his big form that bespoke age\nand effort. It irritated Mrs. Whitney to look at him, as it had irritated\nher to look at Ellen; very painful were the reminders of the ravages of\ntime from these people of about her own age, these whom she as a child\nhad known as children. Crow’s-feet and breaking contour and thin hair in\nthose we have known only as grown people, do not affect us; but the same\nsigns in lifelong acquaintances make it impossible to ignore Decay\nholding up the mirror to us and pointing to aging mouth and throat, as he\nwags his hideous head and says, “Soon–you, too!”",
        "Hiram saw Matilda and his daughter the instant they appeared on the\nbalcony, but he gave no hint of it until they were in the path of his\nmonotonous march. He was nerving himself for Mrs. Whitney as one nerves\nhimself in a dentist’s chair for the descent of the grinder upon a\nsensitive tooth. Usually she got no further than her first sentence\nbefore irritating him. To-day the very sight of her filled him with\nseemingly causeless anger. There was a time when he, watching Matilda\nimprove away from her beginnings as the ignorant and awkward daughter of\nthe keeper of a small hotel, had approved of her and had wished that\nEllen would give more time to the matter of looks. But latterly he had\ncome to the conclusion that a woman has to choose between improving her\nexterior and improving her interior, and that it is impossible or all but\nimpossible for her to do both; he therefore found in Ellen’s very\nindifference to exteriors another reason why she seemed to him so\nsplendidly the opposite of Charles’s wife.",
        "“You certainly look the same as ever, Hiram,” Matilda said, advancing\nwith extended, beautifully gloved hand. The expression of his eyes as he\nturned them upon her gave her a shock, but she forced the smile back into\nher face and went on, “Ross says you always make him think of a tower on\ntop of a high hill, one that has always stood there and always will.”",
        "The gray shadow over Hiram’s face grew grayer. “But you ought to rest,\"\nMrs. Whitney went on. “You and Charles both ought to rest. It’s\nridiculous, the way American men act. Now, Charles has never taken a real\nvacation. When he does go away he has a secretary with him and works all\nday. But at least he gets change of scene, while you–you rarely miss a\nday at the mills.”",
        "“I haven’t missed a whole day in forty-three years,” replied Hiram,\n\"except the day I got married, and I never expect to. I’ll drop in the\nharness. I’d be lost without it.”",
        "“Don’t you think that’s a narrow view of life?” asked Mrs. Whitney.\n\"Don’t you think we ought all to take time to cultivate our higher\nnatures?”",
        "“What do you mean by higher natures?”",
        "Mrs. Whitney scented sarcasm and insult. To interrogate a glittering\ngenerality is to slur its projector; she wished her hearers to be\ndazzled, not moved to the impertinence of cross-examination. “I think you\nunderstand me,” she said loftily.",
        "“I don’t,” replied Hiram. “I’m only a cooper and miller. I haven’t had\nthe advantages of a higher education\"–this last with a steady look\ntoward his son, approaching from the direction of the stables. The young\nman was in a riding suit that was too correct at every point for good\ntaste, except in a college youth, and would have made upon anyone who\nhad been born, or initiated into, the real mysteries of “good form” an\nimpression similar to that of Mrs. Whitney’s costume and accent and\nmanner. There was the note of the fashion plate, the evidence of pains,\nof correctness not instinctive but studied–the marks our new-sprung\nobstreperous aristocracy has made familiar to us all. It would have\nstruck upon a sense of humor like a trivial twitter from the oboe\ntrickling through a lull in the swell of brasses and strings; but Hiram\nRanger had no sense of humor in that direction, had only his instinct\nfor the right and the wrong. The falseness, the absence of the quality\ncalled “the real thing,” made him bitter and sad. And, when his son\njoined them and walked up and down with them, he listened with heavier\ndroop of face and form to the affected chatter of the young “man of the\nworld” and the old ’grande dame” of Chicago society. They talked the\nlanguage and the affairs of a world he had never explored and had no\nwish to explore; its code and conduct, his training, his reason and his\ninstinct all joined in condemning as dishonorable shirking of a man’s\nand woman’s part in a universe so ordered that, to keep alive in it,\neveryone must either work or steal.",
        "But his boy was delighted with the conversation, with Mrs. Whitney, and,\nfinally, with himself. A long, hard ride had scattered his depression of\nmany weeks into a mere haze over the natural sunshine of youth and\nhealth; this haze now vanished. When Mrs. Whitney referred to Harvard, he\nsaid lightly, “You know I was plucked.”",
        "“Ross told me,” said she, in an amused tone; “but you’ll get back all\nright next fall.”",
        "“I don’t know that I care to go,” said Arthur. “I’ve been thinking it\nover. I believe I’ve got about all the good a university can do a man. It\nseems to me a year or so abroad–traveling about, seeing the world–would\nbe the best thing for me. I’m going to talk it over with father–as soon\nas he gets through being out of humor with me.”",
        "Hiram did not look at his son, who glanced a little uneasily at him as\nhe unfolded this new scheme for perfecting his education as “man of\nthe world.”",
        "“Surely your father’s not angry” cried Mrs. Whitney, in a tone intended\nto make Hiram ashamed of taking so narrow, so rural, a view of his son’s\nfashionable mischance.",
        "“No,” replied Hiram, and his voice sounded curt. He added, in an\nundertone: “I wish I were.”",
        "“You’re wrong there, Hiram,” said Mrs. Whitney, catching the words not\nintended for her, and misunderstanding them. “It’s not a case for\nseverity.”",
        "Arthur smiled, and the look he gave his father was a bright indication of\nthe soundness of his heart. Severity! The idea was absurd in connection\nwith the most generous and indulgent of fathers. “You don’t get his\nmeaning, Mrs. Whitney,” said he. “I, too, wish he were angry. I’m afraid\nI’ve made him sad. You know he’s got old-fashioned views of many things,\nand he can’t believe I’ve not really disgraced him and myself.”",
        "“Do you believe it?” inquired Hiram, with a look at him as sudden and\nsharp as the ray of a search light.",
        "“I know it, father,” replied Arthur earnestly. “Am I not right,\nMrs. Whitney?”",
        "“Don’t be such an old fogy, Hiram,” said Mrs. Whitney. “You ought to be\nthankful you’ve got a son like Arthur, who makes a splendid impression\neverywhere. He’s the only western man that’s got into exclusive societies\nat Harvard in years simply on his own merits, and he’s a great favorite\nin Boston and in New York.”",
        "“My children need no one to defend them to me,” said Hiram, in what might\nbe called his quiet tone–the tone he had never in his life used without\ndrying up utterly the discussion that had provoked it. Many people had\nnoted the curious effect of that tone and had resolved to defy it at the\nnext opportunity, “just to see what the consequences would be.” But when\nthe opportunity had come, their courage had always withered.",
        "“You can’t expect me to be like you, father. You wouldn’t, want it,” said\nArthur, after the pause. “I must be myself, must develop my own\nindividuality.”",
        "Ranger stopped and that stopped the others. Without looking at his son,\nhe said slowly: “I ain’t disputing that, boy. It ain’t the question.\"\nThere was tremendousness in his restrained energy and intensity as he\nwent on: “What I’m thinking about is whether I ought to keep on helpingyou to ’develop’ yourself, as you call it. That’s what won’t let me\nrest.” And he abruptly walked away.",
        "Mrs. Whitney and Arthur stared after him. “I don’t think he’s quite well,\nArtie,” she said reassuringly. “Don’t worry. He’ll come round all right.\nBut you ought to be a little more diplomatic.”",
        "Arthur was silent. Diplomacy meant deceit, and he hadn’t yet reached the\nstage of polite and comfortable compromise where deceit figures merely as\nan amiable convenience for promoting smoothness in human intercourse. But\nhe believed that his father would “come round all right,” as Mrs. Whitney\nhad so comfortingly said. How could it be otherwise when he had done\nnothing discreditable, but, on the contrary, had been developing himself\nin a way that reflected the highest credit upon his family, as it marched\nup toward the lofty goal of “cultured” ambition, toward high and secure\nsocial station.",
        "Mrs. Whitney, however, did not believe her own statement. In large part\nher reputation of being a “good, kind sort,” like many such reputations,\nrested on her habit of cheering on those who were going the wrong way and\nwere disturbed by some suspicion of the truth. She had known Hiram Ranger\nlong, had had many a trying experience of his character, gentle as a\ntrade wind–and as steady and unchangeable. Also, beneath her surface of\ndesperate striving after the things which common sense denounces, or\naffects to denounce, as foolishness, there was a shrewd, practical\nperson. “He means some kind of mischief,” she thought–an unreasoned,\ninstinctive conclusion, and, therefore, all-powerful with a woman.",
        "That evening she wrote her daughter not to cut short her visit to get to\nSaint X. “Wait until Ross is ready. Then you can join him at Chicago and\nlet him bring you.”",
        "Just about the hour she was setting down this first result of her\ninstinct’s warning against the danger signal she had seen in Hiram\nRanger’s manner, he was delivering a bombshell. He had led in the family\nprayers as usual and had just laid the Bible on the center-table in the\nback parlor after they rose from their knees. With his hands resting on\nthe cover of the huge volume he looked at his son. There was a\nsacrificial expression in his eyes. “I have decided to withdraw Arthur’s\nallowance,” he said, and his voice sounded hollow and distant, as\nunfamiliar to his own ears as to theirs. “He must earn his own living. If\nhe wants a place at the mills, there’s one waiting for him. If he’d\nrather work at something else, I’ll do what I can to get him a job.”",
        "Silence; and Hiram left the room.",
        "Adelaide was first to recover sufficiently to speak. “O mother,” cried\nshe, “you’re not going to allow this!”",
        "To Adelaide’s and Arthur’s consternation, Ellen replied quietly: “It\nain’t no use to talk to him. I ain’t lived all these years with your\nfather without finding out when he means what he says.”",
        "“It’s so unjust!” exclaimed Adelaide.",
        "There came into Ellen’s face a look she had never seen there before. It\nmade her say: “O mother, I didn’t mean that; only, it does seem hard.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger thought so, too; but she would have died rather than have\nmade the thought treason by uttering it. She followed her husband\nupstairs, saying: “You and Arthur can close up, and put out the lights.”",
        "Adelaide, almost in tears over her brother’s catastrophe, was thrilled\nwith admiration of his silent, courageous bearing. “What are you going to\ndo, Artie?”",
        "This incautious question drew his inward ferment boiling to the surface.\n\"He has me down and I’ve got to take his medicine,” said the young man,\nteeth together and eyes dark with fury.",
        "This she did not admire. Her first indignation abated, as she sat on\nthere thinking it out. “Maybe father is nearer right than we know,” she\nsaid to herself finally. “After all, Arthur will merely be doing as\nfather does. There’s something wrong with him, and with me, too, or we\nshouldn’t think that so terrible.” But to Arthur she said nothing.\nEncourage him in his present mood she must not; and to try to dissuade\nhim would simply goad him on.",
        "That night there was sleep under Hiram Ranger’s roof for Mary the cook\nonly. Of the four wakeful ones the most unhappy was Hiram himself, the\nprecipitator of it all. Arthur had the consolation of his conviction that\nhis calamity was unjust; Adelaide and her mother, of their conviction\nthat in the end it could not but be well with Arthur. For Hiram there was\nno consolation. He reviewed and re-reviewed the facts, and each time he\nreached again his original conclusion; the one course in repairing the\nmistakes of the boy’s bringing up was a sharp rightabout. “Don’t waste no\ntime gettin’ off the wrong road, once you’re sure it’s wrong,” had been a\nmaxim of his father, and he had found it a rule with no exceptions. He\nappreciated that there is a better way from the wrong road into the right\nthan a mad dash straight across the stumpy fields and rocky gullies\nbetween. That rough, rude way, however, was the single way open to him\nhere. Whenever it had become necessary for him to be firm with those he\nloved, it had rarely been possible for him to do right in the right way;\nhe had usually been forced to do right in the wrong way–to hide himself\nfrom them behind a manner of cold and silent finality, and, so, to\nprevent them from forming an alliance and a junction of forces with the\ntraitor softness within him. Besides, gentle, roundabout, gradual\nmeasures would require time–delay; and he must “put his house in order\"\nforthwith.",
        "Thus, even the consolation that he was at least doing right was denied\nhim. As he lay there he could see himself harshly forcing the bitter\nmedicine upon his son, the cure for a disease for which he was himself\nresponsible; he could see his son’s look and could not deny its justice.\n\"I reckon he hates me,” thought Hiram, pouring vitriol into his own\nwounds, “and I reckon he’s got good cause to.”",
        "But there was in the old miller a Covenanter fiber tough as ironwood.\nThe idea of yielding did not enter his head. He accepted his sufferings\nas part of his punishment for past indulgence and weakness; he would\nendure, and go forward. His wife understood him by a kind of intuition\nwhich, like most of our insight into the true natures of those close\nabout us, was a gradual permeation from the one to the other rather than\nclear, deliberate reasoning. But the next morning her sore and anxious\nmother’s heart misread the gloom of his strong face into sternness\ntoward her only son.",
        "“When did you allow to put the boy to work, father?” she finally said,\nand her tone unintentionally made Hiram feel more than ever as if he had\nsentenced “the boy” to hard labor in the degradation and disgrace of a\nchain gang.",
        "As he waited some time for self-control before answering, she thought her\ninquiry had deepened his resentment. “Not that I don’t think you’re\nright, maybe,” she hastened to add, “though\"–this wistfully, in a\nfeminine and maternal subtlety of laying the first lines for sapping and\nmining his position–\"I often think about our life, all work and no play,\nand wonder if we oughtn’t to give the children the chance we never had.”",
        "“No good never came of idleness,” said Hiram, uncompromisingly, “and to\nbe busy about foolishness is still worse. Work or rot–that’s life.”",
        "“That’s so; that’s so,” she conceded. And she was sincere; for that was\nher real belief, and what she had hinted was a mere unthinking repetition\nof the shallow, comfortable philosophy of most people–those “go easys\"\nand “do nothings” and “get nowheres” wherewith Saint X and the\nsurrounding country were burdened. “Still,” she went on, aloud, “Arthur\nhasn’t got any bad habits, like most of the young men round here with\nmore money than’s good for them.”",
        "“Drink ain’t the only bad habit,” replied Hiram. “It ain’t the worst,\nthough it looks the worst. The boy’s got brains. It ain’t right to allow\nhim to choke ’em up with nonsense.”",
        "Ellen’s expression was assent.",
        "“Tell him to come down to the mill next Monday,” said Hiram, after\nanother silence, “and tell him to get some clothes that won’t look\nridiculous.” He paused, then added; “A man that ain’t ready to do\nanything, no matter what so long as it’s useful and honest, is good\nfor nothing.”",
        "The night had bred in Arthur brave and bold resolves. He would not tamely\nsubmit; he would cast his father off, would go forth and speedily carve a\nbrilliant career. He would show his father that, even if the training of\na gentleman develops tastes above the coarseness of commerce, it also\ndevelops the mental superiority that makes fleeing chaff of the obstacles\nto fame and wealth. He did not go far into details; but, as his essays at\nHarvard had been praised, he thought of giving literature’s road to\ndistinction the preference over the several others that must be smooth\nbefore him. Daylight put these imaginings into silly countenance, and he\nfelt silly for having lingered in their company, even in the dark. As he\ndressed he had much less than his wonted content with himself. He did not\ntake the same satisfaction in his clothes, as evidence of his good taste,\nor in his admired variations of the fashion of wearing the hair and tying\nthe scarf. Midway in the process of arranging his hair he put down his\nmilitary brushes; leaning against the dressing table, he fixed his mind\nupon the first serious thoughts he had ever had in his whole\nirresponsible, sheltered life. “Well,” he said, half-aloud, “there issomething wrong! If there isn’t, why do I feel as if my spine had\ncollapsed?” After a long pause, he added: “And it has! All that held it\nsteady was father’s hand.”",
        "The whole lofty and beautiful structure of self-complacence upon which\nhe had lounged, preening his feathers and receiving social triumphs and\nthe adulation of his “less fortunate fellows” as the due of his own\npersonal superiority, suddenly slipped from under him. With a rueful\nsmile at his plight, he said: “The governor has called me down.” Then,\nresentfully, and with a return of his mood of dignity outraged and pride\ntrampled upon: “But he had no right to put me up there–or let me climb\nup there.” Once a wrong becomes “vested,” it is a “vested right,” sacred,\ntaboo. Arthur felt that his father was committing a crime against him.",
        "When he saw Adelaide and his mother their anxious looks made him furious.\nSo! They knew how helpless he was; they were pitying him. Pitying him!\nPitying him! He just tasted his coffee; with scowling brow he hastened\nto the stables for his saddle horse and rode away alone. “Wait a few\nminutes and I’ll come with you,” called Adelaide from the porch as he\ngalloped by. He pretended not to hear. When clear of the town he “took it\nout” on his horse, using whip and spur until it gripped the bit and ran\naway. He fought savagely with it; at a turn in the road it slipped and\nfell, all but carrying him under. He was in such a frenzy that if he had\nhad a pistol he would have shot it. The chemical action of his crisis\nprecipitated in a black mass all the poison his nature had been absorbing\nin those selfish, supercilious years. So long as that poison was held in\nsuspense it was imperceptible to himself as well as to others. But now,\nthere it was, unmistakably a poison. At the sight his anger vanished.\n\"I’m a beast!” he ejaculated, astonished. “And here I’ve been imagining I\nwas a fairly decent sort of fellow. What the devil have I been up to, to\nmake me like this?”",
        "He walked along the road, leading his horse by the bridle slipped over\nhis arm. He resumed his reverie of the earlier morning, and began a\nlittle less dimly to see his situation from the new viewpoint. “I deserve\nwhat I’m getting,” he said to himself. Then, at a twinge from the\nresentment that had gone too deep to be ejected in an instant, he added:\n\"But that doesn’t excuse him.” His father was to blame for the whole\nugly business–for his plight within and without. Still, fixing the blame\nwas obviously unimportant beside the problem of the way out. And for that\nproblem he, in saner mood, began to feel that the right solution was to\ndo something and so become in his own person a somebody, instead of being\nmere son of a somebody. “I haven’t got this shock a minute too soon,” he\nreflected. “I must take myself in hand. I–”",
        "“Why, it’s you, Arthur, isn’t it?” startled him.",
        "He looked up, saw Mrs. Whitney coming toward him. She was in a winter\nwalking suit, though the day was warm. She was engaged in the pursuit\nthat was the chief reason for her three months’ retirement to the bluffs\noverlooking Saint X–the preservation of her figure. She hated exercise,\nbeing by nature as lazy, luxurious, and self-indulgent physically as she\nwas alert and industrious mentally. From October to July she ate and\ndrank about what she pleased, never set foot upon the ground if she could\nhelp it, and held her tendency to hips in check by daily massage. From\nJuly to October she walked two or three hours a day, heavily dressed, and\nhad a woman especially to attend to her hair and complexion, in addition\nto the masseuse toiling to keep her cheeks and throat firm for the\nfight against wrinkles and loss of contour.",
        "Arthur frowned at the interruption, then smoothed his features into a\ncordial smile; and at once that ugly mass of precipitated poison began to\nredistribute itself and hide itself from him.",
        "“You’ve had a fall, haven’t you?”",
        "He flushed. She, judging with the supersensitive vanity of all her\nself-conscious “set,” thought the flush was at the implied criticism of\nhis skill; but he was far too good a rider to care about his\nmisadventure, and it was her unconscious double meaning that stung him.\nShe turned; they walked together. After a brief debate as to the time for\nconfessing his “fall,” which, at best, could remain a secret no longer\nthan Monday, he chose the present. “Father’s begun to cut up rough,” said\nhe, and his manner was excellent. “He’s taken away my allowance, and I’m\nto go to work at the mill.” He was yielding to the insidious influence of\nher presence, was dropping rapidly back toward the attitude as well as\nthe accent of “our set.”",
        "At his frank disclosure Mrs. Whitney congratulated herself on her\nshrewdness so heartily that she betrayed it in her face; but Arthur did\nnot see. “I suppose your mother can do nothing with him.” This was spoken\nin a tone of conviction. She always felt that, if she had had Hiram to\ndeal with, she would have been fully as successful with him as she\nthought she had been with Charles Whitney. She did not appreciate the\nfundamental difference in the characters of the two men. Both were iron\nof will; but there was in Whitney–and not in Hiram–a selfishness that\ntook the form of absolute indifference to anything and everything which\ndid not directly concern himself–his business or his physical comfort.\nThus his wife had had her way in all matters of the social career, and he\nwould have forced upon her the whole responsibility for the children if\nshe had not spared him the necessity by assuming it. He cheerfully paid\nthe bills, no matter what they were, because he thought his money’s power\nto buy him immunity from family annoyances one of its chief values. She,\nand everyone else, thought she ruled him; in fact, she not only did not\nrule him, but had not even influence with him in the smallest trifle of\nthe matters he regarded as important.",
        "The last time he had looked carefully at her–many, many years before–he\nhad thought her beautiful; he assumed thenceforth that she was still\nbeautiful, and was therefore proud of her. In like manner he had made up\nhis mind favorably to his children. As the bills grew heavier and\nheavier, from year to year, with the wife and two children assiduously\nexpanding them, he paid none the less cheerfully. “There is some\nsatisfaction in paying up for them,” reflected he. “At least a man can\nfeel that he’s getting his money’s worth.” And he contrasted his luck\nwith the bad luck of so many men who had to “pay up” for “homely frumps,\nthat look worse the more they spend.”",
        "But Arthur was replying to Mrs. Whitney’s remark with a bitter “Nobody\ncan do anything with father; he’s narrow and obstinate. If you argue with\nhim, he’s silent. He cares for nothing but his business.”",
        "Arthur did not hesitate to speak thus frankly to Mrs. Whitney. She seemed\na member of the family, like a sister of his mother or father who had\nlived with them always; also he accepted her at the valuation she and all\nher friends set upon her–he, like herself and them, thought her generous\nand unselfish because she was lavish with sympathetic words and with\nalms–the familiar means by which the heartless cheat themselves into a\nreputation for heart. She always left the objects of her benevolence the\npoorer for her ministrations, though they did not realize it. She adopted\nas the guiding principle of her life the cynical philosophy–\"Give people\nwhat they want, never what they need.” By sympathizing effusively with\nthose in trouble, she encouraged them in low-spiritedness; by lavishing\nalms, she weakened struggling poverty into pauperism. But she took away\nand left behind enthusiasm for her own moral superiority and humanity.\nAlso she deceived herself and others with such fluid outpourings of fine\nphrases about “higher life” and “spiritual thinking” as so exasperated\nHiram Ranger.",
        "Now, instead of showing Arthur what her substratum of shrewd sense\nenabled her to see, she ministered soothingly unto his vanity. His father\nwas altogether wrong, tyrannical, cruel; he himself was altogether right,\na victim of his father’s ignorance of the world.",
        "“I decided not to submit,” said Arthur, as if the decision were one which\nhad come to him the instant his father had shown the teeth and claws of\ntyranny, instead of being an impulse of just that moment, inspired by\nMrs. Whitney’s encouragement to the weakest and worst in his nature.",
        "“I shouldn’t be too hasty about that,” she cautioned. “He is old and\nsick. You ought to be more than considerate. And, also, you should\nbe careful not to make him do anything that would cut you out of\nyour rights.”",
        "It was the first time the thought of his “rights\"–of the share of his\nfather’s estate that would be his when his father was no more–had\ndefinitely entered his head. That he would some day be a rich man he had\naccepted just as he accepted the other conditions of his environment–all\nto which he was born and in which consisted his title to be regarded as\nof the “upper classes,” like his associates at Harvard. Thinking now on\nthe insinuated proposition that his father might disinherit him, he\npromptly rejected it. “No danger of his doing that,” he assured her, with\nthe utmost confidence. “Father is an honest man, and he wouldn’t think of\nanything so dishonest, so dishonorable.”",
        "This view of a child’s rights in the estate of its parents amused Mrs.\nWhitney. She knew how quickly she would herself cut off a child of hers\nwho was obstinately disobedient, and, while she felt that it would be an\noutrage for Hiram Ranger to cut off his son for making what she regarded\nas the beginning of the highest career, the career of “gentleman,” still\nshe could not dispute his right to do so. “Your father may not see your\nrights in the same light that you do, Arthur,” said she mildly. “If I\nwere you, I’d be careful.”",
        "Arthur reflected. “I don’t think it’s possible,” said he, “but I guess\nyou’re right. I must not forget that I’ve got others to think of\nbesides myself.”",
        "This patently meant Janet; Mrs. Whitney held her discreet tongue.",
        "“It will do no harm to go to the office,” she presently continued. “You\nought to get some knowledge of business, anyhow. You will be a man of\nproperty some day, and you will need to know enough about business to be\nable to supervise the managers of your estate. You know, I had Janet take\na course at a business college, last winter, and Ross is in with his\nfather and will be active for several years.”",
        "Thus it came about that on Monday morning at nine Arthur sauntered into\nthe offices of the mills. He was in much such a tumult of anger,\ncuriosity, stubbornness, and nervousness as agitates a child on its\nfirst appearance at school; but in his struggle not to show his feelings\nhe exaggerated his pose into a seeming of bored indifference. The door of\nhis father’s private room was open; there sat Hiram, absorbed in\ndictating to a stenographer. When his son appeared in the doorway, he\napparently did not realize it, though in fact the agitation the young man\nwas concealing under that unfortunate manner was calmness itself in\ncomparison with the state of mind behind Hiram’s mask of somber\nstolidity.",
        "“He’s trying to humiliate me to the depths,” thought the son, as he stood\nand waited, not daring either to advance or to retreat. How could he know\nthat his father was shrinking as a criminal from the branding iron, that\nevery nerve in that huge, powerful, seemingly impassive body was in\ntorture from this ordeal of accepting the hatred of his son in order that\nhe might do what he considered to be his duty? At length the young man\nsaid: “I’m here, father.”",
        "“Be seated–just a minute,” said the father, turning his face toward his\nboy but unable to look even in that direction.",
        "The letter was finished, and the stenographer gathered up her notes and\nwithdrew. Hiram sat nerving himself, his distress accentuating the stern\nstrength of his features. Presently he said: “I see you haven’t come\ndressed for work.”",
        "“Oh, I think these clothes will do for the office,” said Arthur, with\napparent carelessness.",
        "“But this business isn’t run from the office,” replied Hiram, with a\ngentle smile that to the young man looked like the sneer of a tyrant.\n\"It’s run from the mill. It prospers–it always has prospered–because\nI work with the men. I know what they ought to do and what they are\ndoing. We all work together here. There ain’t a Sunday clothes job\nabout the place.”",
        "Arthur’s fingers were trembling as he pulled at his small mustache. What\ndid this tyrant expect of him? He had assumed that a place was to be made\nfor him in the office, a dignified place. There he would master the\nbusiness, would gather such knowledge as might be necessary successfully\nto direct it, and would bestow that knowledge in the humble,\nout-of-the-way corner of his mind befitting matters of that kind. And\nhere was his father, believing that the same coarse and toilsome methods\nwhich had been necessary for himself were necessary for a trained and\ncultured understanding!",
        "“What do you want me to do?” asked Arthur.",
        "Hiram drew a breath of relief. The boy was going to show good sense and\nwillingness after all. “I guess you’d better learn barrel-making first,\"\nsaid he. He rose. “I’ll take you to the foreman of the cooperage, and\nto-morrow you can go to work in the stave department. The first thing is\nto learn to make a first-class barrel.”",
        "Arthur slowly rose to follow. He was weak with helpless rage. If his\nfather had taken him into the office and had invited him to help in\ndirecting the intellectual part of that great enterprise, the part that\nin a way was not without appeal to the imagination, he felt that he might\ngradually have accustomed himself to it; but to be put into the mindless\nroutine of the workingman, to be set about menial tasks which a mere\nmuscular machine could perform better than he–what waste, what\ndegradation, what insult!",
        "He followed his father to the cooperage, the uproar of its machinery\njarring fiercely upon him, but not so fiercely as did the common-looking\nmen slaving in torn and patched and stained clothing. He did not look at\nthe foreman as his father was introducing them and ignored his proffered\nhand. “Begin him at the bottom, Patrick,” explained Hiram, “and show him\nno favors. We must give him a good education.”",
        "“That’s right, Mr. Ranger,” said Patrick, eying his new pupil dubiously.\nHe was not skilled in analysis of manner and character, so Arthur’s\nsuperciliousness missed him entirely and he was attributing the cold and\nvacant stare to stupidity. “A regular damn dude,” he was saying to\nhimself. “As soon as the old man’s gone, some fellow with brains’ll do\nhim out of the business. If the old man’s wise, he’ll buy him an annuity,\nsomething safe and sure. Why do so many rich people have sons like that?\nIf I had one of his breed I’d shake his brains up with a stave.”",
        "Arthur mechanically followed his father back to the office. At the door\nHiram, eager to be rid of him, said: “I reckon that’s about all we can do\nto-day. You’d better go to Black and Peters’s and get you some clothes.\nThen you can show up at the cooperage at seven to-morrow morning, ready\nto put in a good day’s work.”",
        "He laid his hand on his son’s shoulder, and that gesture and the\naccompanying look, such as a surgeon might give his own child upon whom\nhe was performing a cruelly painful operation, must have caused some part\nof what he felt to penetrate to the young man; for, instead of bursting\nout at his father, he said appealingly: “Would it be a very great\ndisappointment to you if I were to go into–into some–some other line?”",
        "“What line?” asked Hiram.",
        "“I haven’t settled–definitely. But I’m sure I’m not fitted for this.” He\nchecked himself from going on to explain that he thought it would mean a\nwaste of all the refinements and elegancies he had been at so much pains\nto acquire.",
        "“Who’s to look after the business when I’m gone?” asked Hiram. “Most of\nwhat we’ve got is invested here. Who’s to look after your mother’s and\nsister’s interests, not to speak of your own?”",
        "“I’d be willing to devote enough time to it to learn the management,\"\nsaid Arthur, “but I don’t care to know all the details.”",
        "It was proof of Hiram’s great love for the boy that he had no impulse of\nanger at this display of what seemed to him the most priggish ignorance.\n\"There’s only one way to learn,” said he quietly. “That’s the way I’ve\nmarked out for you. Don’t forget–we start up at seven. You can breakfast\nwith me at a quarter past six, and we’ll come down together.”",
        "As Arthur walked homeward he pictured himself in jumper and overalls on\nhis way from work of an evening–meeting the Whitneys–meeting Janet\nWhitney! Like all Americans, who become inoculated with “grand ideas,\"\nhe had the super-sensitiveness to appearances that makes foreigners call\nus the most snobbishly conventional people on earth. What would it avail\nto be in character the refined person in the community and in position\nthe admired person, if he spent his days at menial toil and wore the\nlivery of labor? He knew Janet Whitney would blush as she bowed to him,\nand that she wouldn’t bow to him unless she were compelled to do so\nbecause she had not seen him in time to escape; and he felt that she\nwould be justified. The whole business seemed to him a hideous dream, a\nsardonic practical joke upon him. Surely, surely, he would presently wake\nfrom this nightmare to find himself once more an unimperiled gentleman.",
        "In the back parlor at home he found Adelaide about to set out for the\nWhitneys. As she expected to walk with Mrs. Whitney for an hour before\nlunch she was in walking costume–hat, dress, gloves, shoes, stockings,\nsunshade, all the simplest, most expensive-looking, most\nunpractical-looking white. From hat to heels she was the embodiment of\nluxurious, “ladylike\" idleness, the kind that not only is idle itself,\nbut also, being beautiful, attractive, and compelling, is the cause of\nidleness in others. She breathed upon Arthur the delicious perfume of the\nelegant life from which he was being thrust by the coarse hand of his\nfather–and Arthur felt as if he were already in sweaty overalls.",
        "“Well?” she asked.",
        "“He’s going to make a common workman of me,” said Arthur, sullen,\nmentally contrasting his lot with hers. “And he’s got me on the hip. I\ndon’t dare treat him as he deserves. If I did, he’s got just devil enough\nin him to cheat me out of my share of the property. A sweet revenge he\ncould take on me in his will.”",
        "Adelaide drew back–was rudely thrust back by the barrier between her and\nher brother which had sprung up as if by magic. Across it she studied him\nwith a pain in her heart that showed in her face. “O Arthur, how can you\nthink such a thing!” she exclaimed.",
        "“Isn’t it so?” he demanded.",
        "“He has a right to do what he pleases with his own.” Then she softened\nthis by adding, “But he’d never do anything unjust.”",
        "“It isn’t his own,” retorted her brother. “It belongs to us all.”",
        "“We didn’t make it,” she insisted. “We haven’t any right to it, except to\nwhat he gives us.”",
        "“Then you think we’re living on his charity?”",
        "“No–not just that,” she answered hesitatingly. “I’ve never thought it\nout–never have thought about it at all.”",
        "“He brought us into the world,” Arthur pursued. “He has accustomed us to\na certain station–to a certain way of living. It’s his duty in honesty\nand in honor to do everything in his power to keep us there.”",
        "Del admitted to herself that this was plausible, but she somehow felt\nthat it was not true. “It seems to me that if parents bring their\nchildren up to be the right sort–useful and decent and a credit,” said\nshe, “they’ve done the biggest part of their duty. The money isn’t so\nimportant, is it? At least, it oughtn’t to be.”",
        "Arthur looked at her with angry suspicion. “Suppose he made a will giving\nit all to you, Del,” he said, affecting the manner of impartial,\ndisinterested argument, “what would you do?”",
        "“Share with you, of course,” she answered, hurt that he should raise the\nquestion at a time when raising it seemed an accusation of her, or at\nleast a doubt of her.",
        "He laughed satirically. “That’s what you think now,” said he. “But, when\nthe time came, you’d be married to Ross Whitney, and he’d show you how\njust father’s judgment of me was, how wicked it would be to break his\nlast solemn wish and will, and how unfit I was to take care of money. And\nyou’d see it; and the will would stand. Oh, you’d see it! I know human\nnature. If it was a small estate–in those cases brothers and sisters\nalways act generously–no, not always. Some of ’em, lots of ’em, quarrel\nand fight over a few pieces of furniture and crockery. But in a case of\na big estate, who ever heard of the one that was favored giving up his\nadvantage unless he was afraid of a scandal, or his lawyers advised him\nhe might as well play the generous, because he’d surely lose the suit?”",
        "“Of course, Arthur, I can’t be sure what I’d do,” she replied gently;\n\"but I hope I’d not be made altogether contemptible by inheriting a\nlittle money.”",
        "“But it wouldn’t seem contemptible,” he retorted. “It’d be legal and\nsensible, and it’d seem just. You’d only be obeying a dead father’s last\nwishes and guarding the interests of your husband and your children. They\ncome before brothers.”",
        "“But not before self-respect,” she said very quietly. She put her arm\naround his neck and pressed her cheek against his. “Arthur–dear–dear–\"\nshe murmured, “please don’t talk or think about this any more.\nIt–it–hurts.” And there were hot tears in her eyes, and at her heart a\nsense of sickness and of fright; for his presentation of the other side\nof the case made her afraid of what she might do, or be tempted to do, in\nthe circumstances he pictured. She knew she wouldn’t–at least, not so\nlong as she remained the person she then was. But how long would that be?\nHow many years of association with her new sort of friends–with the sort\nRoss had long been–with the sort she was becoming more and more\nlike–how many, or, rather, how few years would it take to complete the\nprocess of making her over into a person who would do precisely what\nArthur had pictured?",
        "Arthur had said a great deal more than he intended–more, even, than he\nbelieved true. For a moment he felt ashamed of himself; then he reminded\nhimself that he wasn’t really to blame; that, but for his father’s\nharshness toward him, he would never have had such sinister thoughts\nabout him or Adelaide. Thus his apology took the form of an outburst\nagainst Hiram. “Father has brought out the worst there is in me!” he\nexclaimed. “He is goading me on to–”",
        "He looked up; Hiram was in the doorway. He sprang to his feet. “Yes, I\nmean it!” he cried, his brain confused, his blood on fire. “I don’t care\nwhat you do. Cut me off! Make me go to work like any common laborer!\nCrush out all the decency there is in me!”",
        "The figure of the huge old man was like a storm-scarred statue. The\ntragedy of his countenance filled his son and daughter with awe and\nterror. Then, slowly, like a statue falling, he stiffly tilted forward,\ncrashed at full length face downward on the floor. He lay as he had\nfallen, breathing heavily, hoarsely. And they, each tightly holding the\nother’s hand like two little children, stood pale and shuddering, unable\nto move toward the stricken colossus.",
        "When Hiram had so far improved that his period of isolation was obviously\nwithin a few days of its end, Adelaide suggested to Arthur, somewhat\ntimidly, “Don’t you think you ought to go to work at the mills?”",
        "He frowned. It was bad enough to have the inward instinct to this, and to\nfight it down anew each day as a temptation to weakness and cowardice.\nThat the traitor should get an ally in his sister–it was intolerable.\nThe frown deepened into a scowl.",
        "But Del had been doing real thinking since she saw her father stricken\ndown, and she was beginning clearly to see his point of view as to\nArthur. That angry frown was discouraging, but she felt too strongly to\nbe quite daunted. “It might help father toward getting well,” she urged,\n\"and make such a difference–in every way.”",
        "“No more hypocrisy. I was right; he was wrong,” replied her brother. He\nhad questioned Dr. Schulze anxiously about his father’s seizure; and\nSchulze, who had taken a strong fancy to him and had wished to put him at\nease, declared that the attack must have begun at the mills, and would\nprobably have brought Hiram down before he could have reached home, had\nhe not been so powerful of body and of will. And Arthur, easily reassured\nwhere he must be assured if he was to have peace of mind, now believed\nthat his outburst had had no part whatever in causing his father’s\nstroke. So he was all for firm stand against slavery. “If I yield an inch\nnow,” he went on to Adelaide, “he’ll never stop until he has made me his\nslave. He has lorded it over those workingmen so long that the least\nopposition puts him in a frenzy.”",
        "Adelaide gave over, for the time, the combat against a stubbornness which\nwas an inheritance from his father. “I’ve only made him more set by what\nI’ve said,” thought she. “Now, he has committed himself. I ought not to\nhave been so tactless.”",
        "Long after Hiram got back in part the power of speech, he spoke only when\ndirectly addressed, and then after a wait in which he seemed to have cast\nabout for the fewest possible words. After a full week of this emphasized\nreticence, he said, “Where is Arthur?”",
        "Arthur had kept away because–so he told himself and believed–while he\nwas not in the least responsible for his father’s illness, still seeing\nhim and being thus reminded of their difference could not but have a bad\neffect. That particular day, as luck would have it, he for the first time\nsince his father was stricken had left the grounds. “He’s out driving,\"\nsaid his mother.",
        "“In the tandem?” asked Hiram.",
        "“Yes,” replied Ellen, knowing nothing of the last development of the\nstrained relations between her husband and her “boy.”",
        "“Then he hasn’t gone to work?”",
        "“He’s stayed close to the house ever since you were taken sick, Hiram,\"\nsaid she, with gentle reproach. “He’s been helping me nurse you.”",
        "Hiram did not need to inquire how little that meant. He knew that, when\nanyone Ellen Ranger loved was ill, she would permit no help in the\nnursing, neither by day nor by night. He relapsed into his brooding over\nthe problem which was his sad companion each conscious moment, now that\nthe warning “Put your house in order” had been so sternly emphasized.",
        "The day Dr. Schulze let them bring him down to the first floor, Mrs.\nHastings–\"Mrs. Fred,” to distinguish her from “Mrs. Val\"–happened to\ncall. Mrs. Ranger did not like her for two reasons–first, she had\nmarried her favorite cousin, Alfred Hastings, and had been the\n\"ruination” of him; second, she had a way of running on and on to\neveryone and anyone about the most intimate family affairs, and\nclose-mouthed Ellen Ranger thought this the quintessence of indiscretion\nand vulgarity. But Hiram liked her, was amused by her always interesting\nand at times witty thrusts at the various members of her family,\nincluding herself. So, Mrs. Ranger, clutching at anything that might\nlighten the gloom thick and black upon him, let her in and left them\nalone together. With so much to do, she took advantage of every moment\nwhich she could conscientiously spend out of his presence.",
        "At sight of Henrietta, Hiram’s face brightened; and well it might. In\nold-fashioned Saint X it was the custom for a married woman to “settle\ndown” as soon as she returned from her honeymoon–to abandon all\nthoughts, pretensions, efforts toward an attractive exterior, and to\nbecome a “settled” woman, “settled” meaning purified of the last grain of\nthe vanity of trying to please the eye or ear of the male. And\nconversation with any man, other than her husband–and even with him, if\na woman were soundly virtuous, through and through–must be as clean\nshorn of allurement as a Quaker meetinghouse. Mrs. Fred had defied this\nancient and sacred tradition of the “settled” woman. She had kept her\nlooks; she frankly delighted in the admiration of men. And the fact that\nthe most captious old maid in Saint X could not find a flaw in her\ncharacter as a faithful wife, aggravated the offending. For, did not her\ndevotion to her husband make dangerous her example of frivolity retained\nand flaunted, as a pure private life in an infidel made his heresies\nplausible and insidious? At “almost” forty, Mrs. Hastings looked “about\"\nthirty and acted as if she were a girl or a widow. Each group of gods\nseems ridiculous to those who happen not to believe in it. Saint X’s set\nof gods of conventionality doubtless seems ridiculous to those who knock\nthe dust before some other set; but Saint X cannot be blamed for having a\nsober face before its own altars, and reserving its jeers and pitying\nsmiles for deities of conventionality in high dread and awe elsewhere.\nAnd if Mrs. Fred had not been “one of the Fuller heirs,” Saint X would\nhave made her feel its displeasure, instead of merely gossiping and\nthreatening.",
        "“I’m going the round of the invalids to-day,” began Henrietta, after she\nhad got through the formula of sick-room conversation. “I’ve just come\nfrom old John Skeffington. I found all the family in the depths. He\nfooled ’em again last night.”",
        "Hiram smiled. All Saint X knew what it meant for old Skeffington to “fool\n’em again.” He had been dying for three years. At the first news that he\nwas seized of a mortal illness his near relations, who had been driven\nfrom him by his temper and his parsimony, gathered under his roof from\nfar and near, each group hoping to induce him to make a will in its\nfavor. He lingered on, and so did they–watching each other, trying to\noutdo each other in complaisance to the humors of the old miser. And he\ngot a new grip on life through his pleasure in tyrannizing over them and\nin putting them to great expense in keeping up his house. He favored\nfirst one group, then another, taking fagots from fires of hope burning\ntoo high to rekindle fires about to expire.",
        "“How is he?” asked Hiram.",
        "“They say he can’t last till fall,” replied Henrietta; “but he’ll last\nanother winter, maybe ten. He’s having more and more fun all the time. He\nhas made them bring an anvil and hammer to his bedside, and whenever he\nhappens to be sleeping badly–and that’s pretty often–he bangs on the\nanvil until the last one of his relations has got up and come in; then,\nmaybe he’ll set ’em all to work mending his fishing tackle–right in the\ndead of night.”",
        "“Are they all there still?” asked Hiram. “The Thomases, the Wilsons, the\nFrisbies, and the two Cantwell old maids?”",
        "“Everyone–except Miss Frisbie. She’s gone back home to Rushville, but\nshe’s sending her sister on to take her place to-morrow. I saw Dory\nHargrave in the street a while ago. You know his mother was a first\ncousin of old John’s. I told him he ought not to let strangers get the\nold man’s money, that he ought to shy his castor into the ring.”",
        "“And what did Dory say?” asked Hiram.",
        "“He came back at me good and hard,” said Mrs. Fred, with a good-humored\nlaugh. “He said there’d been enough people in Saint X ruined by\ninheritances and by expecting inheritances. You know the creek that flows\nthrough the graveyard has just been stopped from seeping into the\nreservoir. Well, Dory spoke of that and said there was, and always had\nbeen, flowing from every graveyard a stream far more poisonous than any\ngraveyard creek, yet nobody talked of stopping it.”",
        "The big man, sitting with eyes downcast, began to rub his hands, one over\nthe other–a certain sign that he was thinking intently.",
        "“There’s a good deal of truth in what he said,” she went on. “Look at our\nfamily, for instance. We’ve been living on an allowance from Grandfather\nFuller in Chicago for forty years. None of us has ever done a stroke of\nwork; we’ve simply been waiting for him to die and divide up his\nmillions. Look at us! Bill and Tom drunkards, Dick a loafer without even\nthe energy to be a drunkard; Ed dead because he was too lazy to keep\nalive. Alice and I married nice fellows; but as soon as they got into our\nfamily they began to loaf and wait. We’ve been waiting in decent, or I\nshould say, indecent, poverty for forty years, and we’re still waiting.\nWe’re a lot of paupers. We’re on a level with the Wilmots.”",
        "“Yes–there are the Wilmots, too,” said Hiram absently.",
        "“That’s another form of the same disease,” Henrietta went on. “Did you\nknow General Wilmot?”",
        "“He was a fine man,” said Hiram, “one of the founders of this town, and\nhe made a fortune out of it. He got overbearing, and what he thought was\nproud, toward the end of his life. But he had a good heart and worked for\nall he had–honest work.”",
        "“And he brought his family up to be real down-East gentlemen and\nladies,” resumed Henrietta. “And look at ’em. They lost the money,\nbecause they were too gentlemanly and too ladylike to work to hold on to\nit. And there they live in the big house, half-starved. Why, really, Mr.\nRanger, they don’t have enough to eat. And they dress in clothes that\nhave been in the family for a generation. They make their underclothes\nout of old bed linen. And the grass on their front lawns is three feet\nhigh, and the moss and weeds cover and pry up the bricks of their walks.\nThey’re too ’proud’ to work and too poor to hire. How much have they\nborrowed from you?”",
        "“I don’t know,” said Hiram. “Not much.”",
        "“I know better–and you oughtn’t to have lent them a cent. Yesterday old\nWilmot was hawking two of his grandfather’s watches about. And all the\nWilmots have got brains, just as our family has. Nothing wrong with\neither of us, but that stream Dory Hargrave was talking about.”",
        "“There’s John Dumont,” mused Ranger.",
        "“Yes–he is an exception. But what’s he doing with what his father left\nhim? I don’t let them throw dust in my eyes with his philanthropy as they\ncall it. The plain truth is he’s a gambler and a thief, and he uses what\nhis father left him to be gambler and thief on the big scale, and so keep\nout of the penitentiary–’finance,’ they call it. If he’d been poor, he’d\nhave been in jail long ago–no, he wouldn’t–he’d have done differently.\nIt was the money that started him wrong.”",
        "“A great deal of good can be done with money,” said Hiram.",
        "“Can it?” demanded Mrs. Fred. “It don’t look that way to me. I’m full of\nthis, for I was hauling my Alfred over the coals this very morning\"–she\nlaughed–\"for being what I’ve made him, for doing what I’d do in his\nplace–for being like my father and my brothers. It seems to me, precious\nlittle of the alleged good that’s done with wealth is really good; and\nwhat little isn’t downright bad hides the truth from people. Talk about\nthe good money does! What does it amount to–the good that’s good, and\nthe good that’s rotten bad? What does it all amount to beside the good\nthat having to work does? People that have to work hard are usually\nhonest and have sympathy and affection and try to amount to something.\nAnd if they are bad, why at least they can’t hurt anybody but themselves\nvery much, where a John Dumont or a Skeffington can injure\nhundreds–thousands. Take your own case, Mr. Ranger. Your money has never\ndone you any good. It was your hard work. All your money has ever done\nhas been–Do you think your boy and girl will be as good a man and woman,\nas useful and creditable to the community, as you and Cousin Ellen?”",
        "Hiram said nothing; he continued to slide his great, strong,\nuseful-looking hands one over the other.",
        "“A fortune makes a man stumble along if he’s in the right road, makes him\nrace along if he’s in the wrong road,” concluded Henrietta.",
        "“You must have been talking a great deal to young Hargrave lately,” said\nHiram shrewdly.",
        "She blushed. “That’s true,” she admitted, with a laugh. “But I’m not\naltogether parroting what he said. I do my own thinking.” She rose. “I’m\nafraid I haven’t cheered you up much.”",
        "“I’m glad you came,” replied Hiram earnestly; then, with an\nadmiring look, “It’s a pity some of the men of your family haven’t\ngot your energy.”",
        "She laughed. “They have,” said she. “Every one of us is a first-rate\ntalker–and that’s all the energy I’ve got–energy to wag my tongue.\nStill–You didn’t know I’d gone into business?”",
        "“Business?”",
        "“That is, I’m backing Stella Wilmot in opening a little shop–to sell\nmillinery.”",
        "“A Wilmot at work!” exclaimed Hiram.",
        "“A Wilmot at work,” affirmed Henrietta. “She’s more like her great\ngrandfather; you know how a bad trait will skip several generations and\nthen show again. The Wilmots have been cultivating the commonness of work\nout of their blood for three generations, but it has burst in again. She\nmade a declaration of independence last week. She told the family she\nwas tired of being a pauper and beggar. And when I heard she wanted to do\nsomething I offered to go in with her in a business. She’s got a lot of\ntaste in trimming hats. She certainly has had experience enough.”",
        "“She always looks well,” said Hiram.",
        "“And you’d wonder at it, if you were a woman and knew what she’s had to\nwork on. So I took four hundred dollars grandfather sent me as a birthday\npresent, and we’re going to open up in a small way. She’s to put her name\nout–my family won’t let me put mine out, too. ’Wilmot & Hastings’ would\nsound well, don’t you think? But it’s got to be ’Wilmot & Co.’ We’ve\nhired a store–No. 263 Monroe Street. We have our opening in August.”",
        "“Do you need any–” began Hiram.",
        "“No, thank you,” she cut in, with a laugh. “This is a close corporation.\nNo stock for sale. We want to hold on to every cent of the profits.”",
        "“Well,” said Hiram, “if you ever do need to borrow, you know where to\ncome.”",
        "“Where the whole town comes when it’s hard up,” said Henrietta; and she\nastonished the old man by giving him a shy, darting kiss on the brow.\n\"Now, don’t you tell your wife!” she exclaimed, laughing and blushing\nfuriously and making for the door.",
        "When Adelaide, sent by her mother, came to sit with him, he said: “Draw\nthe blinds, child, and leave me alone. I want to rest.” She obeyed him.\nAt intervals of half an hour she opened the door softly, looked in at\nhim, thought he was asleep, and went softly away. But he had never been\nfurther from sleep in his life. Henrietta Hastings’s harum-scarum\ngossiping and philosophizing happened to be just what his troubled mind\nneeded to precipitate its clouds into a solid mass that could be clearly\nseen and carefully examined. Heretofore he had accepted the conventional\nexplanations of all the ultimate problems, had regarded philosophers as\ntime wasters, own brothers to the debaters who whittled on dry-goods\nboxes at the sidewalk’s edge in summer and about the stoves in the rear\nof stores in winter, settling all affairs save their own. But now,\nsitting in enforced inaction and in the chill and calm which diffuses\nfrom the tomb, he was using the unused, the reflective, half of his mind.",
        "Even as Henrietta was talking, he began to see what seemed to him the\nhidden meaning in the mysterious “Put your house in order” that would\ngive him no rest. But he was not the man to make an important decision in\nhaste, was the last man in the world to inflict discomfort, much less\npain, upon anyone, unless the command to do it came unmistakably in the\none voice he dared not disobey. Day after day he brooded; night after\nnight he fought to escape. But, slowly, inexorably, his iron inheritance\nfrom Covenanter on one side and Puritan on the other asserted itself.\nHeartsick, and all but crying out in anguish, he advanced toward the\nstern task which he could no longer deny or doubt that the Most High God\nhad set for him.",
        "He sent for Dory Hargrave’s father.",
        "Mark Hargrave was president of the Tecumseh Agricultural and Classical\nUniversity, to give it its full legal entitlements. It consisted in a\nfaculty of six, including Dr. Hargrave, and in two meager and modest,\nalmost mean “halls,” and two hundred acres of land. There were at that\ntime just under four hundred students, all but about fifty working their\nway through. So poor was the college that it was kept going only by\nefforts, the success of which seemed miraculous interventions of\nProvidence. They were so regarded by Dr. Hargrave, and the stubbornest\ninfidel must have conceded that he was not unjustified.",
        "As Hargrave, tall and spare, his strong features illumined by life-long\nunselfish service to his fellow-men, came into Hiram Ranger’s presence,\nHiram shrank and grew gray as his hair. Hargrave might have been the\nofficer come to lead him forth to execution.",
        "“If you had not sent for me, Mr. Ranger,” he began, after the greetings,\n\"I should have come of my own accord within a day or two. Latterly God\nhas been strongly moving me to lay before you the claims of my boys–of\nthe college.”",
        "This was to Hiram direct confirmation of his own convictions. He tried to\nforce his lips to say so, but they would not move.",
        "“You and Mrs. Ranger,” Hargrave went on, “have had a long life, full of\nthe consciousness of useful work well done. Your industry, your fitness\nfor the just use of God’s treasure, has been demonstrated, and He has\nmade you stewards of much of it. And now approaches the final test, the\ngreatest test, of your fitness to do His work. In His name, my old\nfriend, what are you going to do with His treasure?”",
        "Hiram Ranger’s face lighted up. The peace that was entering his soul lay\nupon the tragedy of his mental and physical suffering soft and serene\nand sweet as moonlight beautifying a ruin. “That’s why I sent for you,\nMark,” he said.",
        "“Hiram, are you going to leave your wealth so that it may continue to do\ngood in the world? Or, are you going to leave it so that it may tempt\nyour children to vanity and selfishness, to lives of idleness and folly,\nto bring up their children to be even less useful to mankind than they,\neven more out of sympathy with the ideals which God has implanted? All of\nthose ideals are attainable only through shoulder-to-shoulder work such\nas you have done all your life.”",
        "“God help me!” muttered Hiram. The sweat was beading his forehead and his\nhands were clasped and wrenching each at the other, typical of the two\nforces contending in final battle within him. “God help me!”",
        "“Have you ever looked about you in this town and thought of the meaning\nof its steady decay, moral and physical? God prospered the hard-working\nmen who founded it; but, instead of appreciating His blessings, they\nregarded the wealth He gave them as their own; and they left it to their\nchildren. And see how their sin is being visited upon the third and\nfourth generations! Industry has been slowly paralyzing. The young\npeople, whose wealth gave them the best opportunities, are leading idle\nlives, are full of vanity of class and caste, are steeped in the sins\nthat ever follow in the wake of idleness–the sins of selfishness and\nindulgence. Instead of being workers, leading in the march upward,\ninstead of taking the position for which their superior opportunities\nshould have fitted them, they set an example of idleness and indolence.\nThey despise their ancestry of toil which should be their pride. They\npride themselves upon the parasitism which is their shame. And they set\nbefore the young an example of contempt for work, of looking on it as a\ncurse and a disgrace.”",
        "“I have been thinking of these things lately,” said Hiram.",
        "“It is the curse of the world, this inherited wealth,” cried Hargrave.\n\"Because of it humanity moves in circles instead of forward. The ground\ngained by the toiling generations, is lost by the inheriting generations.\nAnd this accursed inheritance tempts men ever to long for and hope for\nthat which they have not earned. God gave man a trial of the plan of\nliving in idleness upon that which he had not earned, and man fell. Then\nGod established the other plan, and through it man has been rising–but\nrising slowly and with many a backward slip, because he has tried to\nthwart the Divine plan with the system of inheritance. Fortunately, the\ngreat mass of mankind has had nothing to leave to heirs, has had no hope\nof inheritances. Thus, new leaders have ever been developed in place of\nthose destroyed by inherited prosperity. But, unfortunately, the law of\ninheritance has been able to do its devil’s work upon the best element in\nevery human society, upon those who had the most efficient and exemplary\nparents, and so had the best opportunity to develop into men and women of\nthe highest efficiency. No wonder progress is slow, when the leaders of\neach generation have to be developed from the bottom all over again, and\nwhen the ideal of useful work is obscured by the false ideal of living\nwithout work. Waiting for dead men’s shoes! Dead men’s shoes instead of\nshoes of one’s own.”",
        "“Dead men’s shoes,” muttered Hiram.",
        "“The curse of unearned wealth,” went on his friend. “Your life, Hiram,\nleaves to your children the injunction to work, to labor cheerfully and\nequally, honestly and helpfully, with their brothers and sisters; but\nyour wealth–If you leave it to them, will it not give that injunction\nthe lie, will it not invite them to violate that injunction?”",
        "“I have been watching my children, my boy, especially,” said Hiram. “I\ndon’t know about all this that you’ve been saying. It’s a big subject;\nbut I do know about this boy of mine. I wish I’d ’a’ taken your advice,\nMark, and put him in your school. But his mother was set on the East–on\nHarvard.” Tears were in his eyes at this. He remembered how she, knowing\nnothing of college, but feeling it was her duty to have her children\neducated properly, a duty she must not put upon others, had sent for the\ncatalogues of all the famous colleges in the country. He could see her\nporing over the catalogues, balancing one offering of educational\nadvantage against another, finally deciding for Harvard, the greatest of\nthem all. He could hear her saying: “It’ll cost a great deal, Hiram. As\nnear as I can reckon it out it’ll cost about a thousand dollars a\nyear–twelve hundred if we want to be v-e-r-y liberal, so the catalogue\nsays. But Harvard’s the biggest, and has the most teachers and scholars,\nand takes in all the branches. And we ought to give our Arthur the best.\"\nAnd now–By what bitter experience had he learned that the college is not\nin the catalogue, is a thing apart, unrelated and immeasurably different!\nHis eyes were hot with anger as he thought how the boy’s mother, honest,\nconscientious Ellen, had been betrayed.",
        "“Look here, Mark,” he blazed out, “if I leave money to your college I\nwant to see that it can’t ever be like them eastern institutions of\nlearning.” He made a gesture of disgust. “Learning!”",
        "“If you leave us anything, Hiram, leave it so that any young man who gets\nits advantages must work for them.”",
        "“That’s it!” exclaimed Hiram. “That’s what I want. Can you draw me up\nthat kind of plan? No boy, no matter what he has at home, can come to\nthat there college without working his way through, without learning to\nwork, me to provide the chance to earn the living.”",
        "“I have just such a plan,” said Hargrave, drawing a paper from his\npocket. “I’ve had it ready for years waiting for just such an\nopportunity.”",
        "“Read it,” said Hiram, sinking deep in his big chair and closing his eyes\nand beginning to rub his forehead with his great hand.",
        "And Hargrave read, forgetting his surroundings, forgetting everything in\nhis enthusiasm for this dream of his life–a university, in fact as well\nas in name, which would attract the ambitious children of rich and\nwell-to-do and poor, would teach them how to live honestly and nobly,\nwould give them not only useful knowledge to work with but also the light\nto work by. “You see, Hiram, I think a child ought to begin to be a man\nas soon as he begins to live–a man, standing on his own feet, in his own\nshoes, with the courage that comes from knowing how to do well something\nwhich the world needs.”",
        "He looked at Hiram for the first time in nearly half an hour. He was\nalarmed by the haggard, ghastly gray of that majestic face; and his\nthought was not for his plan probably about to be thwarted by the man’s\npremature death, but of his own selfishness in wearying and imperiling\nhim by importunity at such a time. “But we’ll talk of this again,” he\nsaid sadly, putting the paper in his pocket and rising for instant\ndeparture.",
        "“Give me the paper,” said Hiram, putting out his trembling hand, but not\nlifting his heavy, blue-black lids.",
        "Mark gave it to him hesitatingly. “You’d better put it off till you’re\nstronger, Hiram.”",
        "“I’ll see,” said Hiram. “Good morning, Mark.”",
        "Judge Torrey was the next to get Ranger’s summons; it came toward\nmid-afternoon of that same day. Like Hargrave, Torrey had been his\nlife-long friend.",
        "“Torrey,” he said, “I want you to examine this plan\"–and he held up the\npaper Hargrave had left–\"and, if it is not legal, put it into legal\nshape, and incorporate it into my will. I feel I ain’t got much time.\"\nWith a far-away, listening look–\"I must put my house in order–in order.\nDraw up a will and bring it to me before five o’clock. I want you to\nwrite it yourself–trust no one–no one!” His eyes were bright, his\ncheeks bluish, and he spoke in a thick, excited voice that broke and\nshrilled toward the end of each sentence.",
        "“I can’t do it to-day. Too much haste–”",
        "“To-day!” commanded Hiram. “I won’t rest till it’s done!”",
        "“Of course, I can–”",
        "“Read the paper now, and give me your opinion.”",
        "Torrey put on his glasses, opened the paper. “Oh!” he exclaimed. “I\nremember this. It’s in my partner’s handwriting. Hargrave had Watson\ndraw it up about five years ago. We were very careful in preparing it.\nIt is legal.”",
        "“Very well,” continued Hiram. “Now I’ll give you the points of my will.”",
        "Torrey took notebook and pencil from his pocket.",
        "“First,” began Hiram, as if he were reciting something he had learned by\nheart, “to my wife, Ellen, this house and everything in it, and the\ngrounds and all the horses and carriages and that kind of thing.”",
        "“Yes,” said Torrey, looking up from his note making.",
        "“Second, to my wife an income of seven thousand a year for life–that is\nwhat it cost her and me to live last year, and the children–except the\nextras. Seven thousand for life–but only for life.”",
        "“Yes,” said Torrey, his glance at Hiram now uneasy and expectant.",
        "“Third, to my daughter, Adelaide, two thousand a year for her life–to be\ndivided among her daughters equally, if she have any; if not, to revert\nto my estate at her death.”",
        "“Yes,” said Torrey.",
        "“Fourth, to my son, five thousand dollars in cash.”",
        "A long pause, Torrey looking at his old friend and client as if he\nthought one or the other of them bereft of his senses. At last, he said,\n\"Yes, Hiram.”",
        "“Fifth, to my brothers, Jacob and Ezra, four hundred dollars each,\"\ncontinued Hiram, in his same voice of repeating by rote, “and to my\nsister Prudence, five thousand dollars–so fixed that her husband can’t\ntouch it.”",
        "“Yes,” said Torrey.",
        "“Sixth, the rest of my estate to be made into a trust, with Charles\nWhitney and Mark Hargrave and Hampden Scarborough trustees, with power to\nselect their successors. The trust to be administered for the benefit of\nTecumseh University under the plan you have there.”",
        "Torrey half-rose from his chair, his usually calm features reflecting his\ninner contention of grief, alarm, and protest. But there was in Hiram’s\nface that which made him sink back without having spoken.",
        "“Seventh,” continued Hiram, “the mills and the cooperage to be continued\nas now, and not to be sold for at least fifteen years. If my son Arthur\nwishes to have employment in them, he is to have it at the proper wages\nfor the work he does. If at the end of fifteen years he wishes to buy\nthem, he to have the right to buy, that is, my controlling interest in\nthem, provided he can make a cash payment of ten per cent of the then\nvalue; and, if he can do that, he is to have ten years in which to\ncomplete the payment–or longer, if the trustees think it wise.”",
        "A long pause; Hiram seemed slowly to relax and collapse like a man\nstretched on the rack, who ceases to suffer either because the torture is\nended or because his nerves mercifully refuse to register any more pain.\n\"That is all,” he said wearily.",
        "Torrey wiped his glasses, put them on, wiped them again, hung them on the\nhook attached to the lapel of his waistcoat, put them on, studied the\npaper, then said hesitatingly: “As one of your oldest friends, Hiram, and\nin view of the surprising nature of the–the–”",
        "“I do not wish to discuss it,” interrupted Hiram, with that gruff\nfinality of manner which he always used to hide his softness, and which\ndeceived everyone, often even his wife. “Come back at five o’clock with\ntwo witnesses.”",
        "Torrey rose, his body shifting with his shifting mind as he cast about\nfor an excuse for lingering. “Very well, Hiram,” he finally said. As he\nshook hands, he blurted out huskily, “The boy’s a fine young fellow, Hi.\nIt don’t seem right to disgrace him by cutting him off this way.”",
        "Hiram winced. “Wait a minute,” he said. He had been overlooking the\npublic–how the town would gossip and insinuate. “Put in this, Torrey,\"\nhe resumed after reflecting. And deliberately, with long pauses to\nconstruct the phrases, he dictated: “I make this disposal of my estate\nthrough my love for my children, and because I have firm belief in the\nsoundness of their character and in their capacity to do and to be. I\nfeel they will be better off without the wealth which would tempt my son\nto relax his efforts to make a useful man of himself and would cause my\ndaughter to be sought for her fortune instead of for herself.”",
        "“That may quiet gossip against your children,” said Torrey, when he had\ntaken down Hiram’s slowly enunciated words, “but it does not change the\nextraordinary character of the will.”",
        "“John,” said Hiram, “can you think of a single instance in which\ninherited wealth has been a benefit, a single case where a man has become\nmore of a man than he would if he hadn’t had it?”",
        "Hiram waited long. Torrey finally said: “That may be, but–” But what?\nTorrey did not know, and so came to a full stop.",
        "“I’ve been trying for weeks to think of one,” continued Hiram, “and\nwhenever I thought I’d found one, I’d see, on looking at all the facts,\nthat it only seemed to be so. And I recalled nearly a hundred instances\nright here in Saint X where big inheritances or little had been ruinous.”",
        "“I have never thought on this aspect of the matter before,” said Torrey.\n\"But to bring children up in the expectation of wealth, and then to leave\nthem practically nothing, looks to me like–like cheating them.”",
        "“It does, John,” Hiram answered. “I’ve pushed my boy and my girl far\nalong the broad way that leads to destruction. I must take the\nconsequences. But God won’t let me divide the punishment for my sins with\nthem. I see my duty clear. I must do it. Bring the will at five o’clock.”",
        "Hiram’s eyes were closed; his voice sounded to Torrey as if it were the\nutterance of a mind far, far away–as far away as that other world which\nhad seemed vividly real to Hiram all his life; it seemed real and near to\nTorrey, looking into his old friend’s face. “The power that’s guiding\nhim,” Torrey said to himself, “is one I daren’t dispute with.” And he\nwent away with noiseless step and with head reverently bent.",
        "The Rangers’ neighbors saw the visits of Hargrave and Torrey. Immediately\na rumor of a bequest to Tecumseh was racing through the town and up the\nBluffs and through the fashionable suburb. It arrived at Point Helen, the\nseat of the Whitneys, within an hour after Torrey left Ranger. It had\naccumulated confirmatory detail by that time–the bequest was large; was\nvery large; was half his fortune–and the rest of the estate was to go to\nthe college should Arthur and Adelaide die childless.",
        "Mrs. Whitney lost no time. At half-past four she was seated in the same\nchair in which Hargrave and Torrey had sat. It was not difficult to bring\nup the subject of the two marriages, which were doubly to unite the\nhouses and fortunes of Ranger and Whitney–the marriages of Arthur and\nJanet, of Ross and Adelaide. “And, of course,” said Mrs. Whitney, “we all\nwant the young people started right. I don’t believe children ought to\nfeel dependent on their parents. It seems to me that puts filial and\nparental love on a very low plane. Don’t you think so?”",
        "“Yes,” said Hiram.",
        "“The young people ought to feel that their financial position is secure.\nAnd, as you and Ellen and Charles and I have lived for our children, have\ntoiled to raise them above the sordid cares and anxieties of life, we\nought to complete our work now and make them–happy.”",
        "Hiram did not speak, though she gave him ample time.",
        "“So,” pursued Mrs. Whitney, “I thought I wouldn’t put off any longer\ntalking about what Charles and I have had in mind some months. Ross and\nJanet will soon be here, and I know all four of the children are anxious\nto have the engagements formally completed.”",
        "“Completed?” said Hiram.",
        "“Yes,” reaffirmed Matilda. “Of course they can’t be completed until we\nparents have done our share. You and Ellen want to know that Arthur and\nAdelaide won’t be at the mercy of any reverse in business Charles might\nhave–or of any caprice which might influence him in making his will. And\nCharles and I want to feel the same way as to our Ross and Janet.”",
        "“Yes,” said Hiram. “I see.” A smile of stern irony roused his features\nfrom their repose into an expressiveness that made Mrs. Whitney\nexceedingly uncomfortable–but the more resolute.",
        "“Charles is willing to be liberal both in immediate settlement and in\nbinding himself in the matter of his will,” she went on. “He often says,\n’I don’t want my children to be impatient for me to die. I want to make\n’em feel they’re getting, if anything, more because I’m alive.’”",
        "A long pause, then Hiram said: “That’s one way of looking at it.”",
        "“That’s your way,” said Matilda, as if the matter were settled. And\nshe smiled her softest and sweetest. But Hiram saw only the glitter in\nher cold brown eyes, a glitter as hard as the sheen of her\nhenna-stained hair.",
        "“No,” said he emphatically, “that’s not my way. That’s the broad and\neasy way that leads to destruction. Ellen and I,” he went on, his\nexcitement showing only in his lapses into dialect, “we hain’t worked\nall our lives so that our children’ll be shiftless idlers, settin’\n’round, polishin’ their fingernails, and thinkin’ up foolishness and\nbreedin’ fools.”",
        "Matilda had always known that Hiram and Ellen were hopelessly vulgar; but\nshe had thought they cherished a secret admiration for the “higher\nthings” beyond their reach, and were resolved that their son should be a\ngentleman and their daughter a lady. She found in Hiram’s energetic\nbitterness nothing to cause her to change her view. “He simply wants to\nhold on to his property to the last, and play the tyrant,” she said to\nherself. “All people of property naturally feel that way.” And she held\nsteadily to her programme. “Well, Hiram,” she proceeded tranquilly, “if\nthose marriages are to take place, Charles and I will expect you to meet\nus halfway.”",
        "“If Ross and my Delia and Arthur and your Jane are fond of each other,\nlet ’em marry as you and Charles, as Ellen and I married. I ain’t buyin’\nyour son, nor sellin’ my daughter. That’s my last word, Tillie.”",
        "On impulse, he pressed the electric button in the wall behind him.\nWhen the new upstairs girl came, he said: “Tell the children I want\nto see ’em.”",
        "Arthur and Adelaide presently came, flushed with the exercise of the\ntennis the girl had interrupted.",
        "“Mrs. Whitney, here,” said Hiram, “tells me her children won’t marry\nwithout settlements, as it’s called. And I’ve been tellin’ her that my\nson and daughter ain’t buyin’ and sellin’.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney hid her fury. “Your father has a quaint way of expressing\nhimself,” she said, laughing elegantly. “I’ve simply been trying to\npersuade him to do as much toward securing the future of you two as Mr.\nWhitney is willing to do. Don’t be absurd, Hiram. You know better than to\ntalk that way.”",
        "Hiram looked steadily at her. “You’ve been travelin’ about, ’Tilda,\"\nhe said, “gettin’ together a lot of newfangled notions. Ellen and I\nand our children stick to the old way.” And he looked at Arthur, then\nat Adelaide.",
        "Their faces gave him a twinge at the heart. “Speak up!” he said. “Do you\nor do you not stick to the old way?”",
        "“I can’t talk about it, father,” was Adelaide’s evasive answer, her face\nscarlet and her eyes down.",
        "“And you, sir?” said Hiram to his son.",
        "“You’ll have to excuse me, sir,” replied Arthur coldly.",
        "Hiram winced before Mrs. Whitney’s triumphant glance. He leaned forward\nand, looking at his daughter, said: “Del, would you marry a man who\nwouldn’t take you unless you brought him a fortune?”",
        "“No, father,” Adelaide answered. She was meeting his gaze now. “But, at\nthe same time, I’d rather not be dependent on my husband.”",
        "“Do you think your mother is dependent on me?”",
        "“That’s different,” said Adelaide, after a pause.",
        "“How?” asked Hiram.",
        "Adelaide did not answer, could not answer. To answer honestly would be\nto confess that which had been troubling her greatly of late–the\nfeeling that there was something profoundly unsatisfactory in the\nrelations between Ross and herself; that what he was giving her was\ndifferent not only in degree but even in kind from what she wanted, or\nought to want, from what she was trying to give him, or thought she\nought to try to give him.",
        "“And you, Arthur?” asked Hiram in the same solemn, appealing tone.",
        "“I should not ask Janet to marry me unless I was sure I could support her\nin the manner to which she is accustomed,” said Arthur. “I certainly\nshouldn’t wish to be dependent upon her.”",
        "“Then, your notion of marrying is that people get married for a\nliving, for luxury. I suppose you’d expect her to leave you if you\nlost your money?”",
        "“That’s different,” said Arthur, restraining the impulse to reason with\nhis illogical father whose antiquated sentimentalism was as unfitted to\nthe new conditions of American life as were his ideas about work.",
        "“You see, Hiram,” said Mrs. Whitney, good-humoredly, “your children\noutvote you.”",
        "The master workman brought his fist down on the arm of his chair–not a\ngesture of violence, but of dignity and power. “I don’t stand for the\nnotion that marriage is living in luxury and lolling in carriages and\nshowing off before strangers. I told you what my last word was, Matilda.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney debated with herself full half a minute before she\nspoke. In a tone that betrayed her all but departed hope of changing\nhim, she said: “It is a great shock to me to have you even pretend to\nbe so heartless–to talk of breaking these young people’s hearts–just\nfor a notion.”",
        "“It’s better to break their hearts before marriage,” replied Hiram, “than\nto let them break their lives, and their hearts, too, on such marriages.\nThe girl that wants my son only if he has money to enable her to make a\nfool of herself, ain’t fit to be a wife–and a mother. As for Del and\nRoss–The man that looks at what a woman has will never look at what\nshe is–and my daughter’s well rid of him.”",
        "A painful silence, then Mrs. Whitney rose. “If I hadn’t suspected, Hiram,\nthat you intended to cheat your children out of their rights in order to\nget a reputation as a philanthropist, I’d not have brought this matter up\nat this time. I see my instincts didn’t mislead me. But I don’t give up\nhope. I’ve known you too many years, Hiram Ranger, not to know that your\nheart is in the right place. And, after you think it over, you will give\nup this wicked–yes, wicked–plan old Doctor Hargrave has taken advantage\nof your sickness to wheedle you into.”",
        "Hiram, his face and hands like yellow wax, made no answer. Arthur and\nAdelaide followed Mrs. Whitney from the room. “Thank you, Mrs. Whitney,\"\nsaid Arthur, gratefully, when they were out of his father’s hearing. “I\ndon’t know what has come over him of late. He has gone back to his\nchildhood and under the spell of the ideas that seemed, and no doubt\nwere, right then. I believe you have set him to thinking. He’s the best\nfather in the world when he is well and can see things clearly.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney was not so sanguine, but she concealed it. She appreciated\nwhat was troubling Hiram. While she encouraged her own son, her Ross, to\nbe a “gentleman,” she had enough of the American left to see the flaws in\nthat new ideal of hers–when looking at another woman’s son. And the\nsuperciliousness which delighted her in Ross, irritated her in Arthur;\nfor, in him, it seemed a sneering reflection upon the humble and\ntoilsome beginnings of Charles and herself. She believed–not without\nreason–that, under Ross’s glossy veneer of gentleman, there was a shrewd\nand calculating nature; it, she thought, would not permit the gentleman\nto make mess of those matters, which, coarse and sordid though they were,\nstill must be looked after sharply if the gentleman was to be kept going.\nBut she was, not unnaturally, completely taken in by Arthur’s similar\ngame, the more easily as Arthur put into it an intensity of energy which\nRoss had not. She therefore thought Arthur as unpractical as he so\nfashionably professed, thought he accepted without reservation “our\nset’s” pretenses of aristocracy for appearance’s sake. “Of course, your\nfather’ll come round,” she said, friendly but not cordial. “All that’s\nnecessary is that you and Adelaide use a little tact.”",
        "And she was in her victoria and away, a very grand-looking lady, indeed,\nwith two in spick and span summer livery on the box, with her exquisite\nwhite and gold sunshade, a huge sapphire in the end of the handle, a\nstring of diamonds worth a small fortune round her neck, a gold bag,\nstudded with diamonds, in her lap, and her superb figure clad in a\nclose-fitting white cloth dress. In the gates she swept past Torrey and\nhis two clerks accompanying him as witnesses. She understood; her face\nwas anything but an index to her thoughts as she bowed and smiled\ngraciously in response to the old judge’s salutation.",
        "Torrey read the will to Hiram slowly, pausing after each paragraph for\nsign of approval or criticism. But Hiram gave no more indication of his\nthought, by word or expression or motion, than if he had been a seated\nstatue. The reading came to an end, but neither man spoke. The choir of\nbirds, assembled in the great trees round the house, flooded the room\nwith their evening melody. At last, Hiram said: “Please move that table\nin front of me.”",
        "Torrey put the table before him, laid the will upon it ready for\nthe signing.",
        "Hiram took a pen; Torrey went to the door and brought in the two clerks\nwaiting in the hall. The three men stood watching while Hiram’s eyes\nslowly read each word of the will. He dipped the pen and, with a hand\nthat trembled in spite of all his obvious efforts to steady it, wrote his\nname on the line to which Torrey silently pointed. The clerks signed as\nwitnesses.",
        "“Thank you,” said Hiram. “You had better take it with you, judge.”",
        "“Very well,” said Torrey, tears in his eyes, a quaver in his voice.",
        "A few seconds and Hiram was alone staring down at the surface of the\ntable, where he could still see and read the will. His conscience told\nhim he had “put his house in order\"; but he felt as if he had set fire to\nit with his family locked within, and was watching it and them burn to\nashes, was hearing their death cries and their curses upon him.",
        "The two young people, chilled by Mrs. Whitney’s manner, flawless though\nit was, apparently, had watched with sinking hearts the disappearance of\nher glittering chariot and her glistening steeds. Then they had gone into\nthe garden before Torrey and the clerks arrived. And they sat there\nthinking each his own kind of melancholy thoughts.",
        "“What did she mean by that remark about Doctor Hargrave?” asked Arthur,\nafter some minutes of this heavy silence.",
        "“I don’t know,” said Adelaide.",
        "“We must get mother to go at father,” Arthur continued.",
        "Adelaide made no answer.",
        "Arthur looked at her irritably. “What are you thinking about, Del?\"\nhe demanded.",
        "“I don’t like Mrs. Whitney. Do you?”",
        "“Oh, she’s a good enough imitation of the real thing,” said Arthur. “You\ncan’t expect a lady in the first generation.”",
        "Adelaide’s color slowly mounted. “You don’t mean that,” said she.",
        "He frowned and retorted angrily: “There’s a great deal of truth that\nwe don’t like. Why do you always get mad at me for saying what we\nboth think?”",
        "“I admit it’s foolish and wrong of me,” said she; “but I can’t help it.\nAnd if I get half-angry with you, I get wholly angry with myself for\nbeing contemptible enough to think those things. Don’t you get angry at\nyourself for thinking them?”",
        "Arthur laughed mirthlessly–an admission.",
        "“We and father can’t both be right,” she pursued. “I suppose we’re both\npartly right and partly wrong–that’s usually the way it is. But I can’t\nmake up my mind just where he begins to be wrong.”",
        "“Why not admit he’s right through and through, and be done with it?\"\ncried Arthur impatiently. “Why not tell him so, and square yourself\nwith him?”",
        "Adelaide, too hurt to venture speech, turned away. She lingered a while\nin the library; on her way down the hall to ascend to her own room she\nlooked in at her father. There he sat so still that but for the regular\nrise and fall of his chest she would have thought him dead. “He’s\nasleep,” she murmured, the tears standing in her eyes and raining in her\nheart. Her mother she could judge impartially; her mother’s disregard of\nthe changes which had come to assume so much importance in her own and\nArthur’s lives often made her wince. But the same disregard in a man did\nnot offend her; it had the reverse effect. It seemed to her, to the woman\nin her, the fitting roughness of the colossal statue. “That’s a man!\"\nshe now said to herself proudly, as she gazed at him.",
        "His eyes opened and fixed upon her in a look so agonized, that she\nleaned, faint, against the door jamb. “What is it, father?” she gasped.",
        "He did not answer–did not move–sat rigidly on, with that expression\nunchanging, as if it had been fixed there by the sculptor who had made\nthe statue. She tried to go to him, but at the very thought she was\noverwhelmed by such fear as she had not had since she, a child, lay in\nher little bed in the dark, too terrified by the phantoms that beset her\nto cry out or to move. “Father! What is it?” she repeated, then wheeled\nand fled along the hall crying: “Mother! Mother!”",
        "Ellen came hurrying down the stairs.",
        "“It’s father!” cried Adelaide.",
        "Together they went into the back parlor. He was still motionless, with\nthat same frozen yet fiery expression. They went to him, tried to lift\nhim. Ellen dropped the lifeless arm, turned to her daughter. And Adelaide\nsaw into her mother’s inmost heart, saw the tragic lift of one of those\ntremendous emotions, which, by their very coming into a human soul, give\nit the majesty and the mystery of the divine.",
        "“Telephone for Dr. Schulze,” she commanded; then, as Adelaide sped, she\nsaid tenderly to her husband: “Where is the pain? What can I do?”",
        "But he did not answer. And if he could have answered, what could she have\ndone? The pain was in his heart, was the burning agony of remorse for\nhaving done that which he still believed to be right, that which he now\nthought he would give his soul’s salvation for the chance to undo. For,\nas the paralysis began to lock his body fast in its vise, the awful\nthought had for the first time come to him: “When my children know what I\nhave done they will hate me! They will hate me all their lives.”",
        "Dr. Schulze examined him. “Somewhat sooner than I expected,” he muttered.",
        "“How long will it last?” said Ellen.",
        "“Some time–several weeks–months–perhaps.” He would let her learn\ngradually that the paralysis would not relax its grip until it had borne\nhim into the eternal prison and had handed him over to the jailer who\nmakes no deliveries.",
        "Mrs. Ranger consented to a third girl, to do the additional heavy work;\nbut a nurse–no! What had Hiram a wife for, and a daughter, and a son, if\nnot to take care of him? What kind of heartlessness was this, to talk of\npermitting a stranger to do the most sacred offices of love? And only by\nbeing on the watch early and late did Adelaide and Arthur prevent her\ndoing everything for him herself.",
        "“Everybody, nowadays, has trained nurses in these cases,” said Dr.\nSchulze. “I don’t think you ought to object to the expense.”",
        "But the crafty taunt left her as indifferent as did the argument from\nwhat “everybody does.”",
        "“I don’t make rules for others,” replied she. “I only say that nobody\nshall touch Hiram but us of his own blood. I won’t hear to it, and the\nchildren won’t hear to it. They’re glad to have the chance to do a little\nsomething for him that has done everything for them.”",
        "The children thus had no opportunity to say whether they would “hear to\nit” or not. But Arthur privately suggested to Adelaide that she ought\nto try to persuade her mother. “It will make her ill, all this extra\nwork,” said he.",
        "“Not so quickly as having some one about interfering with her,\"\nreplied Adelaide.",
        "“Then, too, it looks so bad–so stingy and–and–old-fashioned,” he\npersisted.",
        "“Not from mother’s point of view,” said Adelaide quietly.",
        "Arthur flushed. “Always putting me in the wrong,” he sneered. Then,\ninstantly ashamed of this injustice, he went on in a different tone, “I\nsuppose this sort of thing appeals to the romantic strain in you.”",
        "“And in mother,” said Del.",
        "Whereupon they both smiled. Romantic was about the last word anyone would\nthink of in connection with frankly practical Ellen Ranger. She would\nhave died without hesitation, or lived in torment, for those she loved;\nbut she would have done it in the finest, most matter-of-fact way in the\nworld, and without a gleam of self-conscious heroics, whether of boasting\nor of martyr-meekness or of any other device for signaling attention to\noneself. Indeed, it would not have occurred to her that she was doing\nanything out of the ordinary. Nor, for that matter, would she have been;\nfor, in this world the unheroic are, more often than not, heroes, and the\nheroic usually most unheroic. We pass heroism by to toss our silly caps\nat heroics.",
        "“There are some things, Artie, our education has been taking out of us,\"\ncontinued Del, “that I don’t believe we’re the better for losing. I’ve\nbeen thinking of those things a good deal lately, and I’ve come to the\nconclusion that there really is a rotten streak in what we’ve been\ngetting there in the East–you at Harvard, I at Mrs. Spenser’s Select\nSchool for Young Ladies. There are ways in which mother and father are\nbetter educated than we.”",
        "“It does irritate me,” admitted Arthur, “to find myself caring so much\nabout the looks of things.”",
        "“Especially,” said Adelaide, “when the people whose opinion we are afraid\nof are so contemptibly selfish and snobbish.”",
        "“Still mother and father are narrow-minded,” insisted her brother.",
        "“Isn’t everybody, about people who don’t think as they do?”",
        "“I’ve not the remotest objection to their having their own views,” said\nArthur loftily, “so long as they don’t try to enforce those views on me.”",
        "“But do they? Haven’t we been let do about as we please?”",
        "Arthur shrugged his shoulders. The discussion had led up to property\nagain–to whether or not his father had the right to do as he pleased\nwith his own. And upon that discussion he did not wish to reenter. He had\nnot a doubt of the justice of his own views; but, somehow, to state them\nmade him seem sordid and mercenary, even to himself. Being really\nconcerned for his mother’s health, as well as about “looks,” he strongly\nurged the doctor to issue orders on the subject of a nurse. “If you\ndemand it, mother’ll yield,” he said.",
        "“But I shan’t, young man,” replied Schulze curtly and with a conclusive\nsqueezing together of his homely features. “Your mother is right. She\ngives your father what money can’t buy and skill can’t replace, what has\noften raised the as-good-as-dead. Some day, maybe, you’ll find out what\nthat is. You think you know now, but you don’t.” And there the matter\nrested.",
        "The large room adjoining Hiram and Ellen’s bedroom was made over into a\nsitting room. The first morning on which he could be taken from his bed\nand partially dressed, Mrs. Ranger called in both the children to assist\nher. The three tried to conceal their feelings as they, not without\nphysical difficulty, lifted that helpless form to the invalid’s chair\nwhich Ellen wheeled close to the bedside. She herself wheeled him into\nthe adjoining room, to the window, with strands of ivy waving in and out\nin the gentle breeze, with the sun bright and the birds singing, and all\nthe world warm and vivid and gay. Hiram’s cheeks were wet with tears;\nthey saw some tremendous emotion surging up in him. He looked at Arthur,\nat Adelaide, back to Arthur. Evidently he was trying to say\nsomething–something which he felt must be said. His right arm trembled,\nmade several convulsive twitches, finally succeeded in lifting his right\nhand the few inches to the arm of the chair.",
        "“What is it, father?” said Ellen.",
        "“Yes–yes–yes,” burst from him in thick, straining utterances.\n\"Yes–yes–yes.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger wiped her eyes. “He is silent for hours,” she said; “then he\nseems to want to say something. But when he speaks, it’s only as just\nnow. He says ’Yes–yes–yes’ over and over again until his strength\ngives out.”",
        "The bursting of the blood vessels in his brain had torn out the nerve\nconnection between the seat of power of speech and the vocal organs. He\ncould think clearly, could put his thoughts into the necessary words; but\nwhen his will sent what he wished to say along his nerves toward the\nvocal organs, it encountered that gap, and could not cross it.",
        "What did he wish to say? What was the message that could not get through,\nthough he was putting his whole soul into it? At first he would begin\nagain the struggle to speak, as soon as he had recovered from the last\neffort and failure; then the idea came to him that if he would hoard\nstrength, he might gather enough to force a passage for the words–for he\ndid not realize that the connection was broken, and broken forever. So,\nhe would wait, at first for several hours, later for several days; and,\nwhen he thought himself strong enough or could no longer refrain, he\nwould try to burst the bonds which seemed to be holding him. With his\nchildren, or his wife and children, watching him with agonized faces, he\nwould make a struggle so violent, so resolute, that even that dead body\nwas galvanized into a ghastly distortion of tortured life. Always in\nvain; always the same collapse of despair and exhaustion; the chasm\nbetween thought and speech could not be bridged. They brought everything\nthey could think of his possibly wanting; they brought to his room\neveryone with whom he had ever had any sort of more than casual\nrelations–Torrey, among scores of others. But he viewed each object and\neach person with the same awful despairing look, his immobile lips giving\nmuffled passage to that eternal “Yes! Yes! Yes!” And at last they decided\nthey were mistaken, that it was no particular thing he wanted, but only\nthe natural fierce desire to break through those prison walls, invisible,\ntranslucent, intangible, worse than death.",
        "Sorrow and anxiety and care pressed so heavily and so unceasingly upon\nthat household for several weeks that there was no time for, no thought\nof, anything but Hiram. Finally, however, the law of routine mercifully\nreasserted itself; their lives, in habit and in thought, readjusted,\nconformed to the new conditions, as human lives will, however chaotic has\nbeen the havoc that demolished the old routine. Then Adelaide took from\nher writing desk Ross’s letters, which she had glanced at rather than\nread as they came; when she finished the rereading, or reading, she was\nnot only as unsatisfied as when she began, but puzzled, to boot–and\npuzzled that she was puzzled. She read them again–it did not take long,\nfor they were brief; even the first letter after he heard of her father’s\nillness filled only the four sides of one sheet, and was written large\nand loose. “He has sent short letters,” said she, “because he did not\nwant to trouble me with long ones at this time.” But, though this excuse\nwas as plausible as most of those we invent to assist us to believe what\nwe want to believe, it did not quite banish a certain hollow, hungry\nfeeling, a sense of distaste for such food as the letters did provide.\nShe was not experienced enough to know that the expression of the\ncountenance of a letter is telltale beyond the expression of the\ncountenance of its writer; that the face may be controlled to lie, but\nnever yet were satisfying and fully deceptive lies told upon paper.\nWithout being conscious of the action of the sly, subconscious instinct\nwhich prompted it, she began to revolve her friend, Theresa Howland,\nwhose house party Ross was honoring with such an extraordinarily long\nlingering. “I hope Theresa is seeing that he has a good time,” she said.\n\"I suppose he thinks as he says–that he’d only be in the way here.\nThat’s a man’s view! It’s selfish, but who isn’t selfish?”",
        "Thus, without her being in the least aware of the process, her mind was\npreparing her for what was about to happen. It is a poor mind, or poorly\nserved by its subconscious half, that is taken wholly by surprise by any\nblow. There are always forewarnings; and while the surface mind\nhabitually refuses to note them, though they be clear as sunset\nsilhouettes, the subconscious mind is not so stupid–so blind under the\nsweet spells of that arch-enchanter, vanity.",
        "At last Ross came, but without sending Adelaide word. His telegram to his\nmother gave just time for a trap to meet him at the station. As he was\nascending the broad, stone approaches of the main entrance to the house\nat Point Helen, she appeared in the doorway, her face really beautiful\nwith mother-pride. For Janet she cared as it is the duty of parent to\ncare for child; Ross she loved. It was not mere maternal imagination that\nmade her so proud of him; he was a distinguished and attractive figure of\nthe kind that dominates the crowds at football games, polo and tennis\nmatches, summer resort dances, and all those events which gather together\nthe youth of our prosperous classes. Of the medium height, with a strong\nlook about the shoulders, with sufficiently, though not aggressively,\npositive features and a clear skin, with gray-green eyes, good teeth, and\na pleasing expression, he had an excellent natural basis on which to\nbuild himself into a particularly engaging and plausible type of\nfashionable gentleman. He was in traveling tweeds of pronounced plaid\nwhich, however, he carried off without vulgarity. His trousers were\nrolled high, after the fashion of the day, to show dark red socks of the\nsame color as his tie and of a shade harmonious to the stripe in the\npattern of shirt and suit and to the stones in his cuff links. He looked\nclean, with the cleanness of a tree after the measureless drenching of a\nstorm; he had a careless, easy air, which completely concealed his\nassiduous and self-complacent self-consciousness. He embraced his mother\nwith enthusiasm.",
        "“How well you look!” he exclaimed; then, with a glance round, “How well\neverything looks!”",
        "His mother held tightly to his arm as they went into the house; she\nseemed elder sister rather than mother, and he delighted her by\ntelling her so–omitting the qualifying adjective before the sister.\n\"But you’re not a bit glad to see me,” he went on. “I believe you don’t\nwant me to come.”",
        "“I’m just a little cross with you for not answering my letters,\"\nreplied she.",
        "“How is Del?” he asked, and for an instant he looked embarrassed and\ncuriously ashamed of himself.",
        "“Adelaide is very well,” was her reply in a constrained voice.",
        "“I couldn’t stay away any longer,” said he. “It was tiresome up at\nWindrift.”",
        "He saw her disappointment, and a smile flitted over his face which\nreturned and remained when she said: “I thought you were finding Theresa\nHowland interesting.”",
        "“Oh, you did?” was his smiling reply. “And why?”",
        "“Then you have come because you were bored?” she said, evading.",
        "“And to see you and Adelaide. I must telephone her right away.”",
        "It seemed to be secretly amusing him to note how downcast she was by\nthis enthusiasm for Adelaide. “I shouldn’t be too eager,” counseled\nshe. “A man ought never to show eagerness with a woman. Let the women\nmake the advances, Ross. They’ll do it fast enough–when they find that\nthey must.”",
        "“Not the young ones,” said Ross. “Especially not those that have choice\nof many men.”",
        "“But no woman has choice of many men,” replied she. “She wants the best,\nand when you’re in her horizon, you’re the best, always.”",
        "Ross, being in the privacy of his own family, gave himself the pleasure\nof showing that he rather thought so himself. But he said: “Nonsense. If\nI listened to your partiality, I’d be making a fearful ass of myself most\nof the time.”",
        "“Well–don’t let Adelaide see that you’re eager,” persisted his\nmother subtly. “She’s very good-looking and knows it and I’m afraid\nshe’s getting an exaggerated notion of her own value. She feels socertain of you.”",
        "“Of course she does,” said Ross, and his mother saw that he was unmoved\nby her adroit thrust at his vanity.",
        "“It isn’t in human nature to value what one feels sure of.”",
        "“But she is sure of me,” said Ross, and while he spoke with\nemphasis, neither his tone nor his look was quite sincere. “We’re\nengaged, you know.”",
        "“A boy and girl affair. But nothing really settled.”",
        "“I’ve given my word and so has she.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney had difficulty in not looking as disapproving as she felt.\nA high sense of honor had been part of her wordy training of her\nchildren; but she had relied–she hoped, not in vain–upon their common\nsense to teach them to reconcile and adjust honor to the exigencies of\npractical life. “That’s right, dear,” said she. “A man or a woman can’t\nbe too honorable. Still, I should not wish you to make her and yourself\nunhappy. And I know both of you would be unhappy if, by marrying, you\nwere to spoil each other’s careers. And your father would not be able\nto allow or to leave you enough to maintain an establishment such as\nI’ve set my heart on seeing you have. Mr. Ranger has been acting very\nstrange of late–almost insane, I’d say.” Her tone became constrained\nas if she were trying to convey more than she dared put into words. “I\nfeel even surer than when I wrote you, that he’s leaving a large part\nof his fortune to Tecumseh College.” And she related–with judicious\nomissions and embroideries–her last talk with Hiram, and the events\nthat centered about it.",
        "Ross retained the impassive expression he had been cultivating ever since\nhe read in English “high life” novels descriptions of the bearing of men\nof the ’haut monde.” “That’s of no consequence,” was his comment, in a\ntone of indifference. “I’m not marrying Del for her money.”",
        "“Don’t throw yourself away, Ross,” said she, much disquieted. “I feel\nsure you’ve been brought up too sensibly to do anything reckless. At\nleast, be careful how you commit yourself until you are sure. In our\nstation people have to think of a great many things before they think of\nanything so uncertain and so more or less fanciful as love. Rest assured,\nAdelaide is thinking of those things. Don’t be less wise than she.”",
        "He changed the subject, and would not go back to it; and after a few\nminutes he telephoned Adelaide, ordered a cart, and set out to take her\nfor a drive. Mrs. Whitney watched him depart with a heavy heart and so\npiteous a face that Ross was moved almost to the point of confiding in\nher what he was pretending not to admit to himself. “Ross is sensible\nbeyond his years,” she said to herself sadly, “but youth is soromantic. It never can see beyond the marriage ceremony.”",
        "Adelaide, with as much haste as was compatible with the demands of so\nimportant an occasion, was getting into a suitable costume. Suddenly she\nlaid aside the hat she had selected from among several that were what the\nFifth Avenue milliners call the ’dernier cri.” “No, I’ll not go!” she\nexclaimed.",
        "Ever since her father was stricken she had stayed near him. Ellen had his\ncomfort and the household to look after, and besides was not good at\ninitiating conversation and carrying it on alone; Arthur’s tongue was\nparalyzed in his father’s presence by his being unable for an instant to\nforget there what had occurred between them. So Del had borne practically\nthe whole burden of filling the dreary, dragging hours for him–who could\nnot speak, could not even show whether he understood or not. He had never\nbeen easy to talk to; now, when she could not tell but that what she said\njarred upon a sick and inflamed soul, aggravating his torture by\nreminding him of things he longed to know yet could not inquire about,\ntantalizing him with suggestions–She dared not let her thoughts go far\nin that direction; it would soon have been impossible to send him any\nmessage beyond despairing looks.",
        "Sometimes she kissed him. She knew he was separated from her as by a\nheavy, grated prison door, and was unable to feel the electric thrill\nof touch; yet she thought he must get some joy out of the sight of\nthe dumb show of caress. Again, she would give up trying to look\ncheerful, and would weep–and let him see her weep, having an instinct\nthat he understood what a relief tears were to her, and that she let\nhim see them to make him feel her loving sympathy. Again, she would be\nso wrought upon by the steady agony of those fixed eyes that she would\nleave him abruptly to hide herself and shudder, tearless, at the utter\nmisery and hopelessness of it all. She wondered at her mother’s calm\nuntil she noticed, after a few weeks, how the face was withering with\nthat shriveling which comes from within when a living thing is dying\nat the core.",
        "She read the Bible to him, selecting consolatory passage with the aid of\na concordance, in the evenings after he had been lifted into bed for the\nnight. She was filled with protest as she read; for it seemed to her that\nthis good man, her best of fathers, thus savagely and causelessly\nstricken, was proof before her eyes that the sentences executed against\nmen were not divine, but the devilish emanations of brute chance. “There\nmay be a devil,” she said to herself, frightened at her own blasphemy,\n\"but there certainly is no God.” Again, the Bible’s promises, so\nconfident, so lofty, so marvelously responsive to the longings and\ncravings of every kind of desolation and woe, had a soothing effect upon\nher; and they helped to put her in the frame of mind to find for\nconversation–or, rather, for her monologues to him–subjects which her\ninstinct told her would be welcome visitors in that prison.",
        "She talked to him of how he was loved, of how noble his influence had\nbeen in their lives. She analyzed him to himself, saying things she would\nnever have dared say had there been the slightest chance of so much\nresponse as the flutter of an eyelid. And as, so it seemed to her, the\nsympathetic relations and understanding between them grew, she became\nfranker, talked of her aspirations–new-born aspirations in harmony with\nhis life and belief. And, explaining herself for his benefit and bringing\nto light her inmost being to show to him, she saw it herself. And when\nshe one day said to him, “Your illness has made a better woman of me,\nfather, dear father,” she felt it with all her heart.",
        "It was from this atmosphere, and enveloped in it, that she went out to\ngreet Ross; and, as she went, she was surprised at her own calmness\nbefore the prospect of seeing him again, after six months’\nseparation–the longest in their lives.",
        "His expression was scrupulously correct–joy at seeing her shadowed by\nsympathy for her calamity. When they were safely alone, he took her hand\nand was about to kiss her. Her beauty was of the kind that is different\nfrom, and beyond, memory’s best photograph. She never looked exactly the\nsame twice; that morning she seemed to him far more tempting than he had\nbeen thinking, with his head for so many weeks full of worldly ideas. He\nwas thrilled anew, and his resolve hesitated before the fine pallor of\nher face, the slim lines of her figure, and the glimpses of her smooth\nwhite skin through the openwork in the yoke and sleeves of her blouse.\nBut, instead of responding she drew back, just a little. He instantly\nsuspected her of being in the state of mind into which he had been trying\nto get himself. He dropped her hand. A trifling incident, but a trifle is\nenough to cut the communications between two human beings; it often\naccomplishes what the rudest shocks would not. They went to the far,\nsecluded end of the garden, he asking and she answering questions about\nher father.",
        "“What is it, Del?” he said abruptly, at length. “You act strained toward\nme.” He did not say this until she had been oppressed almost into silence\nby the height and the thickness of the barrier between them.",
        "“I guess it’s because I’ve been shut in with father,” she suggested.\n\"I’ve seen no one to talk to, except the family and the doctor, for\nweeks.” And she tried to fix her mind on how handsome and attractive he\nwas. As a rebuke to her heart’s obstinate lukewarmness she forced herself\nto lay her hand in his.",
        "He held it loosely. Her making this slight overture was enough to\nrestore his sense of superiority; his resolve grew less unsteady. “It’s\nthe first time,” he went on, “that we’ve really had the chance to judge\nhow we actually feel toward each other–that’s what’s the matter.” His\nface–he was not looking at her–took on an expression of sad reproach.\n\"Del, I don’t believe you–care. You’ve found it out, and don’t want to\nhurt my feelings by telling me.” And he believed what he was saying. It\nmight have been–well, not quite right, for him to chill toward her and\ncontemplate breaking the engagement, but that she should have been doing\nthe same thing–his vanity was erect to the last feather. “It’s most kind\nof you to think so considerately of me,” he said satirically.",
        "She took her hand away. “And you?” she replied coldly. “Are your\nfeelings changed?”",
        "“I–oh, you know I love you,” was his answer in a deliberately\ncareless tone.",
        "She laughed with an attempt at raillery. “You’ve been too long up at\nWindrift–you’ve been seeing too much of Theresa Howland,” said she,\nmerely for something to say; for Theresa was neither clever nor pretty,\nand Del hadn’t it in her to suspect him of being mercenary.",
        "He looked coldly at her. “I have never interfered with your many\nattentions from other men,” said he stiffly. “On the contrary, I have\nencouraged you to enjoy yourself, and I thought you left me free in the\nsame way.”",
        "The tears came to her eyes; and he saw, and proceeded to value still less\nhighly that which was obviously so securely his.",
        "“Whatever is the matter with you, Ross, this morning?” she cried. “Or is\nit I? Am I–”",
        "“It certainly is not I,” he interrupted icily. “I see you again after six\nmonths, and I find you changed completely.”",
        "A glance from her stopped him. “Oh!” she exclaimed, with a dangerous\nsmile. “You are out of humor this morning and are seeking a quarrel.”",
        "“That would be impossible,” he retorted. ’I never quarrel. Evidently\nyou have forgotten all about me.”",
        "Her pride would not let her refuse the challenge, convert in his words,\nfrank in his eyes.",
        "“Possibly,” mocked she, forcing herself to look amusedly at him. “I don’t\nbother much about people I don’t see.”",
        "“You take a light view of our engagement,” was his instant move.",
        "“I should take a still lighter view,” retorted she, “if I thought the way\nyou’re acting was a fair specimen of your real self.”",
        "This from Adelaide, who had always theretofore shared in his almost\nreverent respect for himself. Adelaide judging him, criticising him!\nAll Ross’s male instinct for unquestioning approval from the female was\nastir. “You wish to break our engagement?” he inquired, with a glance of\ncold anger that stiffened her pride and suppressed her impulse to try to\ngain time.",
        "“You’re free,” said she, and her manner so piqued him, that to nerve\nhimself to persist he had to think hard on the magnificence of Windrift\nand the many Howland millions and the rumored Ranger will. She, in a\nseries of jerks and pauses, took off the ring; with an expression and a\ngesture that gave no further hint of how she had valued it, both for its\nown beauty and for what it represented, she handed it to him. “If that’s\nall,” she went on, “I’ll go back to father.” To perfect her pretense, she\nshould have risen, shaken hands cheerfully with him, and sent him\ncarelessly away. She knew it; but she could not.",
        "He was not the man to fail to note that she made no move to rise, or to\nfail to read the slightly strained expression in her eyes and about the\ncorners of her mouth. That betrayal lost Adelaide a triumph; for, seeing\nher again, feeling her beauty and her charm in all his senses, reminded\nof her superiority in brains and in taste to the women from whom he might\nchoose, he was making a losing fight for the worldly wise course.\n\"Anyhow, I must tame her a bit,” he reflected, now that he was sure she\nwould be his, should he find on further consideration that he wanted her\nrather than Theresa’s fortune. He accordingly took his hat, drew himself\nup, bowed coldly.",
        "“Good morning,” he said. And he was off, down the drive–to the lower end\nwhere the stableboy was guarding his trap–he was seated–he was driving\naway–he was gone–gone!",
        "She did not move until he was no longer in sight. Then she rushed into\nthe house, darted up to her room, locked herself in and gave way. It was\nthe first serious quarrel she had ever had with him; it was so little\nlike a quarrel, so ominously like a–No; absurd! It could not be a\nfinality. She rejected that instantly, so confident had beauty and\nposition as a prospective heiress made her as to her powers over any man\nshe chose to try to fascinate, so secure was she in the belief that Ross\nloved her and would not give her up in any circumstances. She went over\ntheir interview, recalled his every sentence and look–this with\nsurprising coolness for a young woman as deeply in love as she fancied\nherself. And her anger rose against him–a curious kind of anger, to\nspring and flourish in a loving heart. “He has been flattered by Theresa\nuntil he has entirely lost his point of view,” she decided. “I’ll give\nhim a lesson when he comes trying to make it up.”",
        "He drove the part of his homeward way that was through streets with his\nwonted attention to “smartness.” True “man of the world,” he never for\nmany consecutive minutes had himself out of his mind–how he was\nconducting himself, what people thought of him, what impression he had\nmade or was making or was about to make. He estimated everybody and\neverything instinctively and solely from the standpoint of advantage to\nhimself. Such people, if they have the intelligence to hide themselves\nunder a pleasing surface, and the wisdom to plan, and the energy to\nexecute, always get just about what they want; for intelligence and\nenergy are invincible weapons, whether the end be worthy or not. As soon,\nhowever, as he was in the road up to the Bluffs, deserted at that hour,\nhis body relaxed, his arms and hands dropped from the correct angle for\ndriving, the reins lay loose upon the horse’s back, and he gave himself\nto dejection. He had thought–at Windrift–that, once he was free from\nthe engagement which was no longer to his interest, he would feel\nbuoyant, elated. Instead, he was mentally even more downcast a figure\nthan his relaxed attitude and gloomy face made him physically. His\nmother’s and his “set’s” training had trimmed generous instincts close to\nthe roots, and, also, such ideals as were not purely for material\nmatters, especially for ostentation. But, being still a young man, those\nroots not only were alive, but also had an under-the-soil vigor; they\neven occasionally sent to the surface sprouts–that withered in the\nuncongenial air of his surroundings and came to nothing. Just now these\nsprouts were springing in the form of self-reproaches. Remembering with\nwhat thoughts he had gone to Adelaide, he felt wholly responsible for the\nbroken engagement, felt that he had done a contemptible thing, had done\nit in a contemptible way; and he was almost despising himself, looking\nabout the while for self-excuses. The longer he looked the worse off he\nwas; for the more clearly he saw that he was what he called, and thought,\nin love with this fresh young beauty, so swiftly and alluringly\ndeveloping. It exasperated him with the intensity of selfishness’s\navarice that he could not have both Theresa Howland’s fortune and\nAdelaide. It seemed to him that he had a right to both. Not in the coldly\nselfish only is the fact of desire in itself the basis of right. By the\ntime he reached home, he was angry through and through, and bent upon\nfinding some one to be angry with. He threw the reins to a groom and,\nsavagely sullen of face, went slowly up the terrace-like steps.",
        "His mother, on the watch for his return, came to meet him. “How is Mr.\nRanger this morning?” she asked.",
        "“Just the same,” he answered curtly.",
        "“And–Del?”",
        "No answer.",
        "They went into the library; he lit a cigarette and seated himself at the\nwriting table. She watched him anxiously but had far too keen insight to\nspeak and give him the excuse to explode. Not until she turned to leave\nthe room did he break his surly silence to say: “I might as well tell\nyou. I’m engaged to Theresa Howland.”",
        "“O Ross, I’m so glad!” she exclaimed, lighting up with pride and\npleasure. Then, warned by his expression, she restrained herself. “I have\nfelt certain for a long time that you would not throw yourself away on\nAdelaide. She is a nice girl–pretty, sweet, and all that. But women\ndiffer from each other only in unimportant details. A man ought to see to\nit that by marrying he strengthens his influence and position in the\nworld and provides for the standing of his children. And I think Theresa\nhas far more steadiness; and, besides, she has been about the world–she\nwas presented at court last spring a year ago, wasn’t she? She is sucha lady. It will be so satisfactory to have her as the head of your\nestablishment–probably Mr. Howland will give her Windrift. And her\ncousin–that Mr. Fanning she married–is connected with all the best\nfamilies in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. They are at the top of\nour aristocracy.”",
        "This recital was not to inform, but to inspire–to remind him what a wise\nand brilliant move he had made in the game of life. And it had precisely\nthe effect she intended. Had she not herself created and fostered in him\nthe nature that would welcome such stuff as a bat welcomes night?",
        "“I’m going back to Windrift to-morrow,” he said, still sullen, but with\nthe note of the quarrel-seeker gone from his voice.",
        "“When do you wish me to write to her?”",
        "“Whenever you like,” he said. The defiance in his tone was for Adelaide.\n\"The engagement is to be announced as soon as I get back.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney was called away, and Ross tried to write to Theresa. But the\nwords wouldn’t come. He wandered restlessly about the room, ordered the\nelectric, went to the Country Club. After an hour of bitterness, he\ncalled up his mother. “You needn’t send that note we were talking about\njust yet,” he said.",
        "“But I’ve already sent it,” his mother answered. In fact, the note was\njust then lying on the table at her elbow.",
        "“What were you in such a devil of a hurry for?” he stormed–an\nunnecessary question, for he knew his mother was the sort of person\nthat loses no time in settling an important matter beyond possibility\nof change.",
        "“I’m sorry, Ross,” she replied soothingly. “I thought I might as well\nsend it, as you had told me everything was settled.”",
        "“Oh–all right–no matter.” He could break with Theresa whenever he\nwished. Perhaps he would not wish to break with her; perhaps, after a few\ndays he would find that his feeling for Adelaide was in reality no\nstronger than he had thought it at Windrift, when Theresa was tempting\nhim with her huge fortune. There was plenty of time before it would be\nnecessary to make final choice.",
        "Nevertheless, he did not leave Saint X, but hung round, sour and morose,\nhoping for some sign from “tamed” Adelaide.",
        "As soon as Theresa got Mrs. Whitney’s note, she wrote to Adelaide. “I’ve\npromised not to tell,” her letter began, “but I never count any promise\nof that kind as including you, dear, sweet Adelaide–”",
        "Adelaide smiled as she read this; Theresa’s passion for intimate\nconfession had been the joke of the school. “Besides,” Adelaide read on,\n\"I think you’ll be especially interested as Ross tells me there was some\nsort of a boy-and-girl flirtation between you and him. I don’t see how\nyou could get over it. Now–you’ve guessed. Yes–we’re engaged, and will\nprobably be married up here in the fall–Windrift is simply divine then,\nyou know. And I want you to be my ’best man.’ The others’ll be Edna and\nClarice and Leila and Annette and perhaps Jessie and Anita. We’re to live\nin Chicago–father will give us a house, I’m sure. And you must come to\nvisit us–”",
        "It is hardly fair to eavesdrop upon a young woman in such an hour as\nthis of Adelaide’s. Only those might do so who are willing freely to\nconcede to others that same right to be human which they themselves\nexercise, whether they will or no, when things happen that smash the\nveneer of “gentleman” or “lady” like an eggshell under a plowboy’s heel,\nand penetrate to and roil that unlovely human nature which is in us all.\nCriticism is supercilious, even when it is just; so, without criticism,\nthe fact is recorded that Adelaide paced the floor and literally raved in\nher fury at this double-distilled, double treachery. The sense that she\nhad lost the man she believed she loved was drowned in the oceanic flood\nof infuriated vanity. She raged now against Ross and now against Theresa\n\"She’s marrying him just because she’s full of envy, and can’t bear to\nsee anybody else have anything,” she fumed. “Theresa couldn’t love\nanybody but herself. And he–he’s marrying her for her money. She isn’t\ngood to look at; to be in the house with her is to find out how mean and\nsmall and vain she is. It serves me right for being snob enough to have\nsuch a friend. If she hadn’t been immensely rich and surrounded by such\nbeautiful things I’d never have had anything to do with her. She’s buying\nhim; he’s selling himself. How vile!”",
        "But the reasons why they were betraying her did not change or mitigate\nthe fact of betrayal; and that fact showed itself to proud, confident\nAdelaide Ranger in the form of the proposition that she had been jilted,\nand that all the world, all her world, would soon know it. Jilted!\nShe–Adelaide Ranger–the all-conqueror–flung aside, flouted, jilted.\nShe went back to that last word; it seemed to concentrate all the insult\nand treason and shame that were heaped upon her. And she never once\nthought of the wound to her heart; the fierce fire of vanity seemed to\nhave cauterized it–if there was a wound.",
        "What could she do to hide her disgrace from her mocking, sneering\nfriends? For, hide it she must–must–must! And she had not a\nmoment to lose.",
        "A little thought, and she went to the telephone and called up her brother\nat the Country Club. When she heard his voice, in fear and fright,\ndemanding what she wanted, she said:",
        "“Will you bring Dory Hargrave to dinner to-night? And, of course, don’t\nlet him know I wanted you to.”",
        "“Is that all!” exclaimed Arthur in a tone of enormous relief, which she\nwas too absorbed in her calamity to be conscious of.",
        "“You will, won’t you? Really, Arthur, it’s very important; and don’t\nsay a word of my having telephoned–not to anybody.”",
        "“All right! I’ll bring him.” A pause, then. “Father’s just the same?”",
        "“Yes,” she answered, in sudden confusion and shame.",
        "In the turmoil of his own affairs Arthur forgot his promise almost while\nhe was making it. Fortunately, as he was driving home, the sight of Dr.\nHargrave, marching absent-mindedly along near the post office, brought it\nto his mind again. With an impatient exclamation–for he prided himself\nupon fidelity to his given word, in small matters as well as in\nlarger–he turned the horse about. He liked Dory Hargrave, and in a way\nadmired him; Dory was easily expert at many of the sports at which Arthur\nhad had to toil before he was able to make even a passable showing. But\nDory, somehow, made him uncomfortable. They had no point of view in\ncommon; Dory regarded as incidental and trivial the things which seemed\nof the highest importance to Arthur. Dory had his way to make in the\nworld; Arthur had been spared that discomfort and disadvantage. Yet Dory\npersisted in pretending to regard Arthur as in precisely the same\nposition as himself; once he had even carried the pretense to the\nimpertinence of affecting to sympathize with Arthur for being so sorely\nhandicapped. On that occasion Arthur had great difficulty in restraining\nplain speech. He would not have been thus tactful and gentlemanly had he\nnot realized that Dory meant the best in the world, and was wholly\nunconscious that envy was his real reason for taking on such a\npreposterous pose. “Poor chap!” Arthur had reflected. “One shouldn’t\nblame him for snatching at any consolation, however flimsy.” In those\ndays Arthur often, in generous mood, admitted–to himself–that fortune\nhad been shamefully partial in elevating him, without any effort on his\npart, but merely by the accident of birth, far above the overwhelming\nmajority of young men. He felt doubly generous–in having such broad\nviews and in not aggravating the misfortunes of the less lucky by\nexpressing them.",
        "Dr. Hargrave and his son–his only child–and his dead wife’s sister,\nMartha Skeffington, lived in a quaint old brick house in University\nAvenue. A double row of ancient elms shaded the long walk straight up\nfrom the gate. On the front door was a huge bronze knocker which Arthur\nlifted and dropped several times without getting response. “Probably the\ngirl’s in the kitchen; and old Miss Skeffington is so deaf she couldn’t\nhear,” he thought. He had known the persons and the habits of that\nhousehold from earliest boyhood. He followed the path round the house\nand thus came in sight of a small outbuilding at the far corner of the\nyard, on the edge of the bank overlooking and almost overhanging the\nriver–Dory’s “workshop.” Its door was open and Arthur could see the\nwhole of the interior. Dory and a young woman were standing by a bench at\nthe window, were bending over something in which they seemed to be\nabsorbed. Not until Arthur stepped upon the doorsill did they lift their\nheads.",
        "“Hello, Artie!” cried Dory, coming forward with extended hand.",
        "Arthur was taking off his hat and bowing to the young woman. “Hello,\nTheo,” said he. “How d’ye do, Estelle?”",
        "Miss Wilmot shook hands with him, a shade constrainedly. “How are you,\nArthur?” she said.",
        "It was in his mouth to ask why she hadn’t been to see Adelaide. He\nchecked himself just in time. She and Adelaide were great friends as\nyoungsters at the public school, but the friendship cooled into\nacquaintance as Adelaide developed fashionable ideas and tastes. Also,\nEstelle had been almost a recluse since she was seventeen. The rest of\nthe Wilmots went into Saint X’s newly developed but flourishing\nfashionable society. They had no money to give return entertainments or\neven to pay their share of the joint, dances and card parties Arthur\ndecided to sheer off. “I came to ask you to the house for sup–dinner\nto-night,” said he. “It’s lonely–just mother and Del and me. Come and\ncheer us up. Come along with me now.”",
        "Dory looked confused. “I’m afraid I can’t,” he all but stammered.",
        "“Of course, I can’t blame you for not caring about coming.” This a\npoliteness, for Arthur regarded his invitation as an honor.",
        "“Oh, you didn’t understand me,” protested Dory. “I was thinking of\nsomething entirely different.” A pause during which he seemed to be\nreflecting. “I’ll be glad to come,” he finally said.",
        "“You needn’t bother to dress,” continued Arthur.",
        "Dory laughed–a frank, hearty laugh that showed the perfect white teeth\nin his wide, humorous-looking mouth. “Dress!” said he. “My other suit is,\nif anything, less presentable than this; and they’re all I’ve got, except\nthe frock–and I’m miserable in that.”",
        "Arthur felt like apologizing for having thus unwittingly brought out\nyoung Hargrave’s poverty. “You look all right,” said he.",
        "“Thanks,” said Dory dryly, his eyes laughing at Arthur.",
        "And, as a matter of fact, though Arthur had not been sincere, Dory did\nlook “all right.” It would have been hard for any drapery not to have set\nwell on that strong, lithe figure. And his face–especially the eyes–was\nso compelling that he would have had to be most elaborately overdressed\nto distract attention from what he was to what he wore.",
        "On the way to the Rangers, he let Arthur do the talking; and if Arthur\nhad been noticing he would have realized that Dory was not listening, but\nwas busy with his own thoughts. Also Arthur would have noticed that, as\nthey came round from the stables to the steps at the end of the front\nveranda, and as Dory caught sight of Adelaide, half-reclining in the\nhammock and playing with Simeon, his eyes looked as if he had been\nsuddenly brought from the darkness into the light.",
        "“Here’s Dory Hargrave, Del,” cried Arthur, and went on into the house,\nleaving them facing each other.",
        "“So glad you’ve come,” said Adelaide, her tone and manner at their\nfriendliest.",
        "But as she faced his penetrating eyes, her composure became less assured.\nHe looked straight at her until her eyes dropped–this while they were\nshaking hands. He continued to look, she feeling it and growing more and\nmore uncomfortable.",
        "“Why did you send for me?” he asked.",
        "She would have liked to deny or to evade; but neither was possible. Now\nthat he was before her she recalled his habit of compelling her always to\nbe truthful not only with him but–what was far worse–also with herself.\n\"Did Arthur tell you I asked him to bring you?” she said, to gain time.",
        "“No,” was his reply. “But, as soon as he asked me, I knew.”",
        "It irritated her that this young man who was not at all a “man of the\nworld” should be able so easily to fathom her. She had yet to learn that\n\"man of the world” means man of a very small and insignificant world,\nwhile Dory Hargrave had been born a citizen of the big world, the real\nworld–one who understands human beings, because his sympathies are broad\nas human nature itself, and his eyes clear of the scales of pretense. He\nwas an illustration of the shallowness of the talk about the loneliness\nof great souls. It is the great souls that alone are not alone. They\nunderstand better than the self-conscious, posing mass of mankind the\nweakness and the pettiness of human nature; but they also appreciate its\nother side. And in the pettiest creature, they still see the greatness\nthat is in every human being, in every living thing for that matter, its\nmajesty of mystery and of potentiality–mystery of its living mechanism,\npotentiality of its position as a source of ever-ascending forms of life.\nFrom the protoplasmal cell descends the genius; from the loins of the\nsodden toiler chained to the soil springs the mother of genius or genius\nitself. And where little people were bored and isolated, Dory Hargrave\ncould without effort pass the barriers to any human heart, could enter in\nand sit at its inmost hearth, a welcome guest. He never intruded; he\nnever misunderstood; he never caused the slightest uneasiness lest he\nshould go away to sneer or to despise. Even old John Skeffington was\nconfidential with him, and would have been friendly had not Dory avoided\nhim.",
        "Adelaide soon fell under the spell of this genius of his for inspiring\nconfidence. She had not fully disclosed her plans to herself; she\nhesitated at letting herself see what her fury against Theresa and Ross\nhad goaded her on to resolve. So she had no difficulty in persuading\nherself that she had probably sent for Dory chiefly to consult with him.\n\"There’s something I want to talk over with you,” said she; “but wait\ntill after din–supper. Have you and Artie been playing tennis?”",
        "“No, he found me at home. Estelle Wilmot and I were playing with a\nmicroscope.”",
        "“Estelle–she has treated me shamefully,” said Adelaide. “I haven’t seen\nher for more than a year–except just a glimpse as I was driving down\nMonroe Street one day. How beautiful she has become! But, then, she\nalways was pretty. And neither her father nor her mother, nor any of the\nrest of the family is especially good-looking. She doesn’t in the least\nresemble them.”",
        "“There probably was a time when her father and mother really loved,” said\nDory. “I’ve often thought that when one sees a beautiful man or woman,\none is seeing the monument to some moment of supreme, perfect happiness.\nThere are hours when even the meanest creatures see the islands of\nenchantment floating in the opal sea.”",
        "Adelaide was gazing dreamily into the sunset. It was some time before she\ncame back, dropped from the impersonal to the personal, which is the\nnormal attitude of most young people and of all the self-absorbed.\nSimeon, who had been inspecting Dory from the far upper end of the\nhammock, now descended to the floor of the veranda, and slowly advanced\ntoward him. Dory put out his hand. “How are you, cousin?” he said,\ngravely shaking Simeon’s extended paw. Simeon chattered delightedly and\nsprang into Dory’s lap to nestle comfortably there.",
        "“I always thought you would fall in love with Estelle, some day,\"\nAdelaide was saying.",
        "Dory looked at Simeon with an ironical smile. “Why does she say those\nthings to me?” he asked. Simeon looked at Adelaide with a puzzled frown\nthat said, “Why, indeed?”",
        "“You and Estelle are exactly suited to each other,” explained she.",
        "“Exactly unsuited,” replied he. “I have nothing that she needs; she has\nnothing that I need. And love is an exchange of needs. Now, I have hurt\nyour vanity.”",
        "“Why do you say that?” demanded Adelaide.",
        "“You’d like to feel that your lover came to you empty-handed, asking\neverything, humbly protesting that he had nothing to give. And you know\nthat I–” He smiled soberly. “Sometimes I think you have really nothing I\nneed or want, that I care for you because you so much need what I can\ngive. You poor pauper, with the delusion that you are rich!”",
        "“You are frank,” said she, smiling, but not liking it.",
        "“And why shouldn’t I be? I’ve given up hope of your ever seeing the\nsituation as it is. I’ve nothing to lose with you. Besides, I shouldn’t\nwant you on any false terms. One has only to glance about him to shrink\nfrom the horrors of marriage based on delusions and lies. So, I can\nafford to be frank.”",
        "She gave him a puzzled look. She had known him all her life; they had\nplayed together almost every day until she was seventeen and went East,\nto school, with Janet Whitney. It was while she was at home on her first\nlong vacation that she had flirted with him, had trapped him into an\navowal of love; and then, having made sure of the truth which her vanity\nof conquest and the fascination of his free and frank manliness for her,\nthough she denied it to herself, had led her on to discover beyond doubt,\nshe became conscience-stricken. And she confessed to him that she loved\nRoss Whitney and was engaged to him; and he had taken the disclosure so\ncalmly that she almost thought he, like herself, had been simply\nflirting. And yet–She dimly understood his creed of making the best of\nthe inevitable, and of the ridiculousness of taking oneself too\nseriously. “He probably has his own peculiar way of caring for a woman,\"\nshe was now reflecting, “just as he has his own peculiar way in every\nother respect.”",
        "Arthur came, and their mother; and not until long after supper, when her\nfather had been got to bed, did she have the chance to continue the\nconversation. As soon as she appeared on the veranda, where Dory and\nArthur were smoking, Arthur sauntered away. She was alone with Dory; but\nshe felt that she had nothing to say to him. The surge of fury against\nRoss and Theresa had subsided; also, now that she had seen Theodore\nHargrave again, she realized that he was not the sort of man one tries to\nuse for the purpose she had on impulse formed, nor she the sort of woman\nwho, in the deliberateness of the second thought, carries into effect an\nimpulse to such a purpose.",
        "When they had sat there in the moonlight several minutes in silence, she\nsaid: “I find I haven’t anything especial to say to you, after all.”",
        "A wait, then from him: “I’m sorry. I had hoped–” He halted.",
        "“Hoped–what?”",
        "“Hoped it was off with you and Whitney.”",
        "“Has some one been saying it was?” she asked sharply.",
        "“No. I thought I felt it when I first saw you.”",
        "“Oh!” she said, enormously relieved. A pause, then constrainedly, “Your\nguess was right.”",
        "“And was that why you sent for me?”",
        "The assent of silence.",
        "“You thought perhaps you might–care for–me?”",
        "It seemed almost true, with him looking so earnestly and hopefully at\nher, and in the moonlight–moonlight that can soften even falsehood until\ntrue and false seem gently to merge. She hesitated to say No. “I don’t\nknow just what I thought,” she replied.",
        "But her tone jarred on the young man whose nerves were as sensitive as a\nthermostat. “You mean, when you saw me again, you felt you really didn’t\ncare,” he said, drawing back so that she could not see his face.",
        "“No,” she replied, earnestly and honestly. “Not that.” And then she flung\nout the truth. “Ross has engaged himself to Theresa Howland, a girl with\na huge big fortune. And I–I–”",
        "“You needn’t say it,” he interrupted, feeling how it was distressing her\nto confess. “I understand.”",
        "“I wasn’t altogether–wicked,” she pleaded. “I didn’t think of you wholly\nbecause I thought you cared for me. I thought of you chiefly because I\nfeel more at home with you than with anyone else. It has always seemed to\nme that you see me exactly as I am, with all the pretenses and\nmeannesses–yet not unkindly, either. And, while you’ve made me angry\nsometimes, when you have refused to be taken in by my best tricks, still\nit was as one gets angry with–with oneself. It simply wouldn’t last.\nAnd, as you see, I tell you anything and everything.”",
        "“You thought you’d engage yourself to me–and see how it worked out?”",
        "“I’m afraid I did.”",
        "A pause. She knew what he was going to say next, and waited for him to\nsay it. At last it came. “Well, now that there’s no deception, why\nshouldn’t you?”",
        "“Somehow, I don’t seem to mind–about Ross, so much. It–it was while I\nwas in with father this evening. You haven’t seen him since he became so\nill, but you will understand why he is a rebuke to all mean thoughts. I\nsuppose I’ll be squirming again to-morrow, but to-night I feel–”",
        "“That Ross has done you a great service. That you’ve lost nothing but a\ndangerous illusion; that you have been honorable with him, and all the\nwrong and the shame are upon him. You must feel it, for it is true.”",
        "Adelaide sighed. “I wish I were strong enough to feel it with my friends\njeering at me, as I can feel it now, Dory.”",
        "He moved nearer the hammock in which she was sitting. “Del,” he said,\n\"shall we become engaged, with the condition that we’ll not marry unless\nwe both wish to, when the time comes?”",
        "“But you’re doing this only to help me–to help me in a weakness I ought\nto be ashamed of.”",
        "“Not altogether,” he replied. “You on your part give me a chance to win\nyou. You will look at me differently–and there’s a great deal in that, a\nvery great deal, Del.”",
        "She smiled–laughed. “I see what you mean.”",
        "But he looked gravely at her. “You promise to do your best to care? An\nengagement is a very solemn thing, Del. You promise?”",
        "She put out her hand. “Yes,” she answered. And, after a moment, in tones\nhe would have known meant opportunity had he been less in love with her,\nless modest about his own powers where she was concerned, she went on:\n\"The night you told me you loved me I did not sleep. What you said–what\nI saw when you opened your heart to me–oh, Dory, I believed then, and I\nbelieve now, that the reason I have not loved you is because I am not\nworthy of you. And I’m afraid I never can–for just that reason.”",
        "He laughed and kissed her hand. “If that’s all that stands in the way,\"\nsaid he, “you’ll love me to distraction.”",
        "Her spirits went soaring as she realized that she had gained honorably\nall she had been tempted to gain by artifice. “But you said a while ago,\"\nshe reminded him mischievously, “that you didn’t need me.”",
        "“So I did,” said he, “but the fox shouldn’t be taken too literally as he\ntalks about the grapes that are out of reach.”",
        "Suddenly she was longing for him to take her in his arms and compel her\nto feel, and to yield to, his strength and his love. But he, realizing\nthat he was in danger of losing his self-control, released her hand and\ndrew away–to burn aloof, when he might have set her on fire.",
        "Ross Whitney found his cousin, Ernest Belden, in the Chicago express\nnext morning. When they were well on their way, Belden said: “I’m really\nsorry it’s all off between you and Adelaide, Ross.”",
        "Ross was silent, struggling against curiosity. Finally curiosity won.\n\"How did you know, Ernest?” he asked.",
        "“On the way to the station I met Dory Hargrave looking like a sunrise. I\nasked him what was up–you know, he and I are like brothers. And he said:\n’I’ve induced Adelaide Ranger to promise to marry me.’ ’Why, I never knew\nyou cared about her in that way,’ said I. And he said: ’There’s lots of\nthings in this world you don’t know, Ernest, a lot of important things,\nand this is one of ’em. I’ve never cared about anybody else.’”",
        "Belden had been thinking that the engagement between Ross and Adelaide\nwas dissolved by mutual consent. A glance at Ross and he changed his\nmind; for, Ross was so amazed at Adelaide’s thus challenging him–it\ncould be nothing more than an audacious challenge–that he showed it. “I\nbeg your pardon, old man,” Belden said impulsively. “I didn’t appreciate\nthat I was making a prying brute of myself.”",
        "Ross decided that a “gentleman” would be silent under the suspicion of\nhaving been jilted, and that therefore he must be silent–on that\nsubject. “Not at all,” said he. “I suppose you haven’t heard yet that I’m\nengaged to Miss Howland, of Chicago.”",
        "“Ah–Really–I congratulate you,” said Belden.",
        "And Ross, seeing that his cousin understood precisely what he had\nintended he should, felt meaner than ever.",
        "Not until Adelaide told Arthur and saw the expression that succeeded his\nfirst blank stare of incredulity did she realize what the world, her\n\"world,” would think of her engagement to Theodore Hargrave. It was\nilluminative of her real character and of her real mind as to Ross, and\nas to Dory also, that, instead of being crushed by her brother’s look of\ndownright horror, she straightway ejected the snobbish suggestions with\nwhich her vanity had been taunting her, and called her heart, as well as\nher pride, to the defense of Dory.",
        "“You’re joking,” said Arthur, when he was able to articulate; “and a\nmighty poor joke it is. Dory! Why, Del, it’s ridiculous. And in place of\nRoss Whitney!”",
        "“Be careful what you say, Artie,” she warned in a quiet, ominous tone,\nwith that in her eyes which should in prudence have halted him. “I am\nengaged to Dory, remember.”",
        "“Nonsense!” cried Arthur. “Why, he hasn’t a cent, except his beggarly\nsalary as professor at that little jay college. And even if he should\namount to something some day, he’ll never have anything or any standing\nin society. I thought you had pride, Del. Just wait till I see him! I’ll\nlet him know what I think of his impudence. Of course, I don’t blame him.\nNaturally, he wants to get up in the world. But you–” Arthur’s laugh\nwas a sneer–\"And I thought you were proud!”",
        "From Del’s eyes blazed that fury which we reserve for those we love when\nthey exasperate us. “Shame on you, Arthur Ranger!” she exclaimed. “Shame\non you! See what a snob you have become. Except that he’s poor, Dory\nHargrave has the advantage of any man we know. He’s got more in his head\nany minute than you or your kind in your whole lives. And he is honorable\nand a gentleman–a real gentleman, not a pretender. You aren’t big\nenough to understand him; but, at least, you know that if it weren’t for\nyour prospects from father, you wouldn’t be in the same class with him.\nHe is somebody in himself. But you–and–and your kind–what do youamount to, in yourselves?”",
        "Arthur lowered at her. “So this is what you’ve been leading up to,\nwith all the queer talk you’ve been giving me on and off, ever since\nwe came home.”",
        "That remark seemed to Adelaide for an instant to throw a flood of light\nin amazing revelation upon her own innermost self. “I believe it is!” she\nexclaimed, as if dazed. Then the light seemed to go, seemed to have been\nonly imaginary. It is not until we are much older than Del then was, that\nwe learn how our acts often reveal us to ourselves.",
        "“So you’re in love with Dory,” scoffed Arthur. “You’re a wonder–you are!\nTo go about the world and get education and manners and culture, and then\nto come back to Saint X and take up with a jay–a fellow that’s never\nbeen anywhere.”",
        "“Physically, he hasn’t traveled much,” said Del, her temper curiously\nand suddenly restored. “But mentally, Artie, dear, he’s been distances\nand to places and in society that your poor brain would ache just at\nhearing about.”",
        "“You’ve lost your senses!”",
        "“No, dear,” replied Del sweetly; “on the contrary, I’ve put myself in the\nway of finding them.”",
        "“You needn’t ’bluff’ with me,” he retorted. He eyed her suspiciously.\n\"There’s some mystery in this.”",
        "Del showed that the chance shot had landed; but, instantly recovering\nherself, she said: “It may interest you to know that a while ago, when\nI told you I was engaged to him, I felt a little uneasy. You see, I’ve\nhad a long course at the same school that has made such a gentleman of\nyou. But, as the result of your talk and the thoughts it suggested, I\nhaven’t a doubt left. I’d marry Dory Hargrave now, if everybody in the\nworld opposed me. Yes, the more opposition, the prouder I’ll be to be\nhis wife!”",
        "“What’s the matter, children?” came in their mother’s voice. “What are\nyou quarreling about?” Mrs. Ranger was hurrying through the room on her\nway to the kitchen; she was too used to heated discussions between them\nto be disturbed.",
        "“What do you think of this, mother?” almost shouted Arthur. “Del here\nsays she’s engaged to Dory Hargrave!”",
        "Mrs. Ranger stopped short. “Gracious!” she ejaculated.",
        "She felt for her “specs,” drew them down from her hair, and hastily\nadjusted them for a good look, first at Arthur, then at Del. She looked\nlong at Del, who was proudly erect and was at her most beautiful best,\neyes glittering and cheeks aglow. “Have you and Ross had a falling out,\nDel?” she asked.",
        "“No, mother,” replied Adelaide; “but we–we’ve broken our engagement,\nand–What Artie says is true.”",
        "No one spoke for a full minute, though the air seemed to buzz with\nthe thinking and feeling. Then, Mrs. Ranger: “Your father mustn’t\nhear of this.”",
        "“Leave me alone with mother, Artie,” commanded Adelaide.",
        "Arthur went, pausing in the doorway to say: “I’m sorry to have hurt you,\nDel. But I meant every word, only not in anger or meanness. I know you\nwon’t do it when you’ve thought it over.”",
        "When Arthur had had time to get far enough away, Adelaide said: “Mother,\nI want you to hear the whole truth–or as much of it as I know myself.\nRoss came and broke off our engagement so that he could marry Theresa\nHowland. And I’ve engaged myself to Dory–partly to cover it, but not\naltogether, I hope. Not principally, I believe. I’m sick and ashamed of\nthe kind of things I’ve been so crazy about these last few years. Before\nthis happened, before Ross came, being with father and thinking over\neverything had made me see with different eyes. And I–I want to try to\nbe–what a woman ought to be.”",
        "Ellen Ranger slowly rolled her front hair under her fingers. At length\nshe said: “Well–I ain’t sorry you’ve broke off with Ross. I’ve been\nnoticing the Whitneys and their goings on for some time. I saw they’d got\nclean out of my class, and–I’m glad my daughter hasn’t. There’s a\ncommon streak in those Whitneys. I never did like Ross, though I never\nwould have said anything, as you seemed to want him, and your father had\nalways been set on it, and thought so high of him. He laid himself out to\nmake your pa think he was a fine character and full of business–and I\nain’t denying that he’s smart, mighty smart–too smart to suit me.” A\nlong reflective pause, then: “But–Dory–Well, my advice is to think it\nover before you jump clear in. Of course, you’ll have enough for both,\nbut I’d rather see you taking up with some man that’s got a good\nbusiness. Teachin’ ’s worse than preachin’ as a business. Still, there’s\nplenty of time to think about that. You’re only engaged.”",
        "“Teachin’ ’s worse than preachin’\"–Adelaide’s new, or, rather, revived\ndemocracy was an aspiration rather than an actuality, was–as to the part\nabove the soil, at least–a not very vigorous looking forced growth\nthrough sordid necessity. In this respect it was like many, perhaps most,\nhuman aspirations–and, like them, it was far more likely to wither than\nto flourish. “Teachin’ ’s worse than preachin’\"–Del began to slip\ndismally down from the height to which Arthur’s tactless outburst had\nblown her. Down, and down, and down, like a punctured balloon–gently,\nbut steadily, dishearteningly. She was ashamed of herself, as ashamed as\nany reader of these chronicles is for her–any reader with one standard\nfor judging other people and another for judging himself. To the credit\nof her character must be set down her shame at her snobbishness. The\nsnobbishness itself should not be set down to her discredit, but should\nbe charged up to that class feeling, as old as property, and fostered\nand developed by almost every familiar fact in our daily environment.",
        "“I shouldn’t be surprised but your father’d be glad, if he knew,” her\nmother was saying. “But it’s no use to risk telling him. A shock\nmight–might make him worse.” She started up. “I must go to him. I\ncame to send you, while I was looking after Mary and the dinner, and I\nclean forgot.”",
        "She hurried away. Adelaide sat thinking, more and more forlorn, though\nnot a whit less determined. “I ought to admire him more than I did Ross,\nand I ought to want to marry him–and I will!”",
        "The birds had stopped singing in the noonday heat. The breeze had died\ndown. Outdoors, in the house, there was not a sound. She felt as if she\nmust not, could not breathe. The silence, like a stealthy hand, lifted\nher from her chair, drew her tiptoeing and breathless toward the room in\nwhich her father was sitting. She paused at its threshold, looked. There\nwas Hiram, in his chair by the window, bolt upright, eyes open and\ngazing into the infinite. Beside that statue of the peace eternal knelt\nEllen, a worn, wan, shrunken figure, the hands clasped, the eyes closed,\nthe lips moving.",
        "“Mother! Mother!” cried Del.",
        "Her mother did not hear. She was moaning, “I believe, Lord, I believe!\nHelp Thou my unbelief!”",
        "On the day after the funeral, Mrs. Ranger and the two children and young\nHargrave were in the back parlor, waiting for Judge Torrey to come and\nread the will. The well-meant intrusions, the services, the burial–all\nthose barbarous customs that stretch on the rack those who really love\nthe dead whom society compels them publicly to mourn–had left cruel\nmarks on Adelaide and on Arthur; but their mother seemed unchanged. She\nwas talking incessantly now, addressing herself to Dory, since he alone\nwas able to heed her. Her talk was an almost incoherent stream, as if she\nneither knew nor cared what she was saying so long as she could keep that\nstream going–the stream whose sound at least made the voice in her\nheart, the voice of desolation, less clear and terrible, though not less\ninsistent.",
        "There was the beat of a man’s footsteps on the side veranda. Mrs. Ranger\nstarted up, listened, sat again. “Oh,” she said, in the strangest tone,\nand with a hysterical little laugh, “I thought it was your father coming\nhome to dinner!” Then from her throat issued a stifled cry like nothing\nbut a cry borne up to the surface from a deep torture-chamber. And she\nwas talking on again–with Adelaide sobbing and Arthur fighting back the\ntears. Hargrave went to the door and admitted the old lawyer.",
        "He had a little speech which he always made on such occasions; but\nto-day, with the knowledge of the astounding contents of that will on his\nmind, his lips refused to utter it. He simply bowed, seated himself, and\nopened the document. The old-fashioned legal phrases soon were steadying\nhim as the harness steadies an uneasy horse; and he was monotonously and\nsonorously rolling off paragraph after paragraph. Except the judge, young\nHargrave was the only one there who clearly understood what those wordy\nprovisions meant. As the reading progressed Dory’s face flushed a deep\nred which slowly faded, leaving him gray and haggard. His father’s\nbeloved project! His father’s! To carry out his father’s project,\nArthur and Adelaide, the woman he loved and her brother, were to lose\ntheir inheritance. He could not lift his eyes. He felt that they were all\nlooking at him, were hurling reproaches and denunciations.",
        "Presently Judge Torrey read: “I make this disposal of my estate through\nmy love for my children and because I have firm belief in the soundness\nof their character, and in their capacity to do and to be. I feel they\nwill be better off without the wealth which would tempt my son to relax\nhis efforts to make a useful man of himself and would cause my daughter\nto be sought for her fortune instead of for herself.”",
        "At the words “without the wealth,” Arthur shifted sharply in his chair,\nand both he and Adelaide looked at Judge Torrey in puzzled wonder. The\njudge read on, read the names of signer and witnesses, then laid the will\ndown and stared gloomily at it. Mrs. Ranger said: “And now, judge, can\nyou tell us in plain words just what it means?”",
        "With many a pause and stammer the old lawyer made it clear: the house and\nits contents and appurtenances, and seven thousand a year to the widow\nfor life; two thousand a year to Adelaide; five thousand in cash to\nArthur and the chance to earn the mill and factory; the rest, practically\nthe whole estate, to Tecumseh University.",
        "“Any further questions?” he asked, breaking the silence that followed his\nexplanation.",
        "No one spoke.",
        "Still without looking at anyone, he put away his glasses? “Then I\nguess I’ll be going. It won’t be necessary to do anything further for\na day or two.”",
        "And, with face like that of criminal slinking from scene of crime, he\ngot himself to the door by a series of embarrassed bows and shuffling\nsteps. Outside, he wiped the streaming sweat from his forehead. “It\nwasn’t my fault,” he muttered, as if some one were accusing him. Then, a\nlittle further from the house, “I ain’t sure Hiram hasn’t done right.\nBut, God help me, I couldn’t never save my children at such a price.”",
        "He was clear of the grounds before Adelaide, the first to move, cast a\nfurtive glance at her brother. Her own disaster was swallowed up for her\nin the thought of how he had been struck down. But she could read nothing\nin his face. He was simply gazing straight ahead, and looking so like\nhis father at his most unfathomable. As soon as he had fully realized\nwhat the will meant, his nerves had stopped feeling and his brain had\nstopped thinking. Adelaide next noted Dory, and grew cold from head to\nfoot. All in a rush it came over her how much she had relied upon her\nprospective inheritance, how little upon herself. What would Dory think\nof her now? And Ross–what a triumph for him, what a narrow escape! Had\nhe suspected? Had others in the town known that of which they of the\nfamily were in complete ignorance? Oh, the horror of the descent–the\nhorror of the rude snatching away of the golden aureole! “Father, father,\nhow could you do it? How could you hurt us so?” she muttered. Then, up\nbefore her rose his face with that frightful look in the eyes. “But how\ndoing it made him suffer!” she thought. And the memory of those hours\non hours she had spent with him, buried alive, flooded over her. “Doing\nit killed him!” she said to herself.",
        "She felt cruel fingers grinding into her arm. With a sharp cry she sprang\nup. Her brother was facing her, his features ablaze with all the evil\npassions in his untrained and unrestrained nature. ’You knew!” he\nhissed. “You traitor! You knew he was doing this. You honeyfugled him.\nAnd you and Hargrave get it all!”",
        "Adelaide shrank as she would not have shrunk under a lash.",
        "“O Arthur! Arthur!” she cried, clasping her hands and stretching them\ntoward him.",
        "“You admit it, do you?” he shouted, seizing her by the shoulders like a\nmadman. “Yes, your guilty face admits it. But I’ll undo your work. I’ll\nbreak the will. Such an outrage as that, such a robbery, won’t stand in\ncourt for a minute.”",
        "Dory had risen, was moving to fling the brother from the sister; but Mrs.\nRanger was before him. Starting up from the stupor into which Judge\nTorrey’s explanation had thrown her, she thrust herself between her\nchildren. “Arthur!” she said, and her voice was quiet and solemn. “Your\nfather is dead.” She drew herself up, and facing her son in her widow’s\nblack, seemed taller than he. “If I had needed any proof that he was\nright about what he did with his own,” she went on, “I’d have found it in\nyour face and in what you just said to your sister. Go to the glass\nthere, boy! Look at your face and remember your words!”",
        "Young Hargrave left the room, went to the garden where they could see him\nfrom the windows and call him if they wished. Arthur hung his head before\nhis mother’s gaze. “It isn’t his will,” he muttered. “Father in his\nright mind would never have made such a will.”",
        "“He never would have made such a will if his children had been in their\nright mind,” replied his mother sternly; and sternness they had never\nbefore seen in those features or heard in that voice. “I know now what he\nwas broodin’ over for weeks. Yes–” and her voice, which rose shrill, was\nthe shriek of the tempest within her–\"and I know now what made him\nbreak so sudden. I noticed you both driftin’ off into foolishness,\nashamed of the ways of your parents, ashamed of your parents, too. But I\ndidn’t give no attention to it, because I thought it was the silliness of\nchildren and that you’d outgrow it. But he always did have a good head\non him, and he saw that you were ridin’ loose-rein to ruin–to be like\nthem Whitneys. Your pa not in his right mind? I see God in that will.”",
        "She paused, but only for breath to resume: “And you, Arthur Ranger, what\nwas in your head when you came here to-day? Grief and love and\nwillingness to carry out your dead father’s last wishes? No! You came\nthinking of how you were to benefit by his death. Don’t deny! I saw your\nface when you found you weren’t going to get your father’s money.”",
        "“Mother!” exclaimed Arthur.",
        "She waved him down imperiously; and he was afraid before her, before her\noutraged love for her outraged dead. “Take care how you stamp on my\nHiram’s grave, Arthur Ranger!”",
        "“He didn’t mean it–you know he didn’t,” pleaded Adelaide. At that moment\nshe could not think of this woman as her mother, but only as the wife,\nthe widow.",
        "But Ellen’s instinct told her that her son, though silent, was still in\ntraitorous rebellion against her idol. And she kept on at him: “With\nHiram hardly out of the house, you’ve forgot all he did for you, all he\nleft you–his good name, his good example. You think only of his money.\nI’ve heard you say children owe nothing to their parents, that parents\nowe everything to the children. Well, that’s so. But it don’t mean what\nyou think. It don’t mean that parents ought to ruin their children.\nAnd your pa didn’t spare himself to do his duty by you–not even though\nit killed him. Yes, it killed him! You’d better go away and fall on your\nknees and ask God to forgive you for having shortened your father’s\nlife. And I tell you, Arthur Ranger, till you change your heart, you’re\nno son of mine.”",
        "“Mother! Mother!” cried Arthur, rushing from the room.",
        "Mrs. Ranger looked vacantly at the place where he had been, dropped into\na chair and burst into a storm of tears.",
        "“Call him back, mother,” entreated Del.",
        "“No! no!” sobbed Ellen Ranger. “He spoke agin’ my dead! I’ll not forgive\nhim till his heart changes.”",
        "Adelaide knelt beside her mother and tried to put her arms around her.\nBut her mother shrank away. “Don’t touch me!” she cried; “leave me\nalone. God forgive me for having bore children that trample on their\nfather’s grave. I’ll put you both out of the house–” and she started up\nand her voice rose to a shriek. “Yes–I’ll put you both out! Your\nfoolishness has ate into you like a cancer, till you’re both rotten. Go\nto the Whitneys. Go among the lepers where you belong. You ain’t fit for\ndecent people.”",
        "She pushed Adelaide aside, and with uncertain steps went into the hall\nand up toward her own room.",
        "Adelaide was about to go in search of her brother when he came hunting\nher. A good example perhaps excepted, there is no power for good equal to\na bad example. Arthur’s outburst before his mother and her, and in what\nseemed the very presence of the dead, had been almost as potent in\nturning Adelaide from bitterness as the influence her father’s\npersonality, her father’s character had got over her in his last illness.\nAnd now the very sight of her brother’s face, freely expressing his\nthoughts, since Ellen was not there to shame him, gave double force to\nthe feelings her mother’s denunciations had roused in her. “We’ve got to\nfight it, Del,” Arthur said, flinging himself down on the grass at her\nfeet. “I’ll see Torrey to-morrow morning.”",
        "Adelaide was silent.",
        "He looked fiercely at her. “You’re going to help me, aren’t you?”",
        "“I must have time to think,” she replied, bent on not provoking him to\ngreater fury.",
        "He raised himself to a sitting posture. “What has that Hargrave fellow\nbeen saying to you?” he cried. “You’ll have to break off with him. His\nfather–the old scoundrel!–got at father and took advantage of his\nillness and his religious superstition. I know just how it was done.\nWe’ll bring it all out.”",
        "Adelaide did not answer.",
        "“What did Dory say to you?” repeated Arthur.",
        "“He went as soon as I came out from mother,” she replied. She thought it\nbest not to tell him that Dory had stopped long enough to urge her to go\nto her brother, and to make and keep peace with him, no matter what he\nmight say to anger her. “Don’t you think,” she continued, “that you ought\nto see Janet and talk with her?”",
        "Artie sank back and stared somberly at the ground.",
        "“When is she coming?” asked his sister.",
        "“I don’t know,” he answered surlily. “Not at all, perhaps. The Whitneys\nwon’t especially care about having any of us in the family now.” He\nlooked furtively at Adelaide, as if he hoped she would protest that he\nwas mistaken, would show him that Janet would be unchanged.",
        "“Mrs. Whitney won’t,” said Adelaide. “But Janet–she’s different, I\nthink. She seems to be high-minded, and I believe she loves you.”",
        "Arthur looked relieved, though Adelaide was too honest to have been able\nto make her tone as emphatic as her words. Yes, Janet was indeed\nhigh-minded, he said to himself; did indeed love him. Her high-mindedness\nand the angel purity of her love had often made him uneasy, not to say\nuncomfortable. He hated to be at the trouble of pretenses; but Janet,\nliving on a far higher plan than he, had simply compelled it. To let her\nsee his human weaknesses, to let her suspect that he was not as\nhigh-minded as she told him he was, to strip from himself the saintly\nrobes and the diadem with which she had adorned him–well, he would put\nit off until after marriage, he had always told himself, and perhaps by\nthat time he would feel a little less like a sinner profaning a sanctuary\nwhen he kissed her. He had from time to time found in himself a sinful\nlonging that she were just a little less of an angel, just a little more\nof a fellow sinner–not too much, of course, for a man wants a pure wife,\na pure mother for his children. But, while the attitudes of worship and\nof saintliness were cramped, often severely so, still on the whole Arthur\nhad thought he was content with Janet just as she was.",
        "“Why don’t you go to Chicago and see her?” suggested Adelaide. “You ought\nto talk with her before anyone else has a chance. I wouldn’t put\nanything past her mother.”",
        "“That’s a good idea!” exclaimed Arthur, his face clearing before the\nprospect of action. “I’ll take the night train. Yes, I must be the one to\ntell her.”",
        "Adelaide had a sense of relief. Arthur would see Janet; Janet would\npour balm upon his wounds, would lift him up to a higher, more generous\nview. Then, whatever he might do would be done in the right spirit,\nwith respect for the memory of their father, with consideration for\ntheir mother.",
        "“You had better not see mother again until you come back,” she suggested.",
        "His face shadowed and shame came into it that was from the real Arthur\nRanger, the son of Hiram and Ellen. “I wish I hadn’t burst out as I did,\nDel,” he said. “I forgot everything in my own wrongs. I want to try to\nmake it all right with mother. I can’t believe that I said what I\nremember I did say before her who’d be glad to die for us.”",
        "“Everything’ll be all right when you come back, Artie,” she assured him.",
        "As they passed the outbuilding where the garden tools were kept they both\nglanced in. There stood the tools their father had always used in\npottering about the garden, above them his old slouch and old straw hats.\nArthur’s lip quivered; Adelaide caught her breath in a sob. “O Artie,\"\nshe cried brokenly, “He’s gone–gone–gone for ever.” And Artie sat on\nthe little bench just within the door and drew Del down beside him, and,\neach tightly in the other’s arms, they cried like the children that they\nwere, like the children that we all are in face of the great tragedy.",
        "A handsome and touching figure was Arthur Ranger as he left his cab and\nslowly ascended the lawn and the steps of the Whitney palace in the Lake\nDrive at eleven the next morning. His mourning garments were most\nbecoming to him, contrasting with the fairness of his hair, the blue of\nhis eyes, and the pallor of his skin. He looked big and strong and sad,\nand scrupulously fashionable, and very young.",
        "The Whitneys were leading in Chicago in building broad and ever broader\nthe barriers, not between rich and poor, but between the very, very rich\nand all the rest of the world. Mrs. Whitney had made a painstaking and\nreverent study of upper-class life in England and on the Continent, and\nwas endeavoring to use her education for the instruction of her\nassociates, and for the instilling of a proper awe into the multitude. To\nenter her door was at once to get the impression that one was receiving a\nhigh privilege. One would have been as greatly shocked as was Mrs.\nWhitney herself, could one have overheard “Charley” saying to her, as he\noccasionally did, with a grin which he strove to make as “common” as he\nknew how, “Really, Tillie, if you don’t let up a little on this putting\non dog, I’ll have to take to sneaking in by the back way. The butler’s a\nsight more of a gent than I am, and the housekeeper can give you points\non being a real, head-on-a-pole-over-the-shoulder lady.” A low fellow at\nheart was Charley Whitney, like so many of his similarly placed\ncompatriots, though he strove as hard as do they, almost as hard as his\nwife, to conceal the deficiencies due to early training in vulgarly\ndemocratic ways of living and thinking.",
        "Arthur, ushered by the excruciatingly fashionable butler into the\nsmallest of the series of reception salons, fell straightway into the\nmost melancholy spirits. He felt the black, icy shadow of the beginnings\nof doubt as to his right to admittance on terms of equality, now that his\ntitles to nobility had been torn from him and destroyed. He felt that he\nwas in grave danger of being soon mingled in the minds of his fashionable\nfriends and their servants with the vulgar herd, the respectable but\n\"impossible” middle classes. Indeed, he was not sure that he didn’t\nreally belong among them. The sound of Janet’s subdued, most elegant\nrustle, drove out of his mind everything but an awful dread of what she\nwould say and think and feel when he had disclosed to her the hideous\ntruth. She came sweeping in, her eyes full of unshed tears, her manner a\nmodel of refined grief, sympathetic, soothing. She was tall and slim, a\nperfect figure of the long, lithe type; her face was small and fine and\ndreamy; her hair of an unusual straw color, golden, yet pale, too, like\nthe latest autumn leaves in the wan sun of November; her eyes were hazel,\nin strange and thrilling contrast to her hair. To behold her was to\nbehold all that man finds most fascinating in woman, but so illumined by\nthe soul within that to look on it with man’s eye for charms feminine\nseemed somewhat like casting sensuous glances upon beauty enmarbled in a\ntemple’s fane. Janet was human, but the human that points the way to\nsexless heaven.",
        "“Dear Artie!” she said gently. ’Dear Artie!” And she took both his\nhands and, as she looked at him, her tears fell. Arthur, in his new\nhumility of poverty, felt honored indeed that any loss of his could\ncause her matchless soul thus to droop upon its dazzling outer walls\nthe somber, showery insignia of grief. “But,” she went on, “you have\nhim still with you–his splendid, rugged character, the memory of all\nhe did for you.”",
        "Arthur was silent. They were seated now, side by side, and he was,\nsomewhat timidly, holding one of her hands.",
        "“He was so simple and so honest–such a man!” she continued. “Does it\nhurt you, dear, for me to talk about him?”",
        "“No–no,” he stammered, “I came to you–to–to–talk about him.” Then,\ndesperately, seizing her other hand and holding both tightly, “Janet,\nwould it make any difference with you if I–if I–no–What am I saying?\nJanet, I release you from our engagement. I–I–have no prospects,” he\nrushed on. “Father–They got round him and wheedled him into leaving\neverything to the college–to Tecumseh. I have nothing–I must give you\nup. I can’t ask you to wait–and–”",
        "He could not go on. He longed for the throbbing, human touch that beauty\nof hers could make so thrilling. But she slowly drew away her hands. Her\nexpression made him say:",
        "“What is it, Janet? What have I said that hurt you?”",
        "“Did you come,” she asked, in a strange, distant voice, “because you\nthought your not having money would make a difference with me?”",
        "“No,” he protested, in wild alarm. “It was only that I feel I–”",
        "“You feel that there could be a question of money between us?” she\ninterrupted.",
        "“Not between us, Janet,” he said eagerly; “but there is\nyour–your mother.”",
        "“I beg you,” she replied coldly, “not to speak of mamma in that way to\nme, even if you have such unjust thoughts of her.”",
        "Arthur looked at her uncertainly. He had an instinct, deep down, that\nthere was something wrong–something in her that he was not fathoming.\nBut in face of that cloud-dwelling beauty, he could only turn and look\nwithin himself. “I beg your pardon, dear,” he said. “You know so little\nof the practical side of life. You live so apart from it, so high above\nit, that I was afraid I’d be doing wrong by you if I did not put that\nside of it before you, too. But in the bottom of my heart I knew you\nwould stand by me.”",
        "She remained cold. “I don’t know whether I’m glad or sorry, Arthur, that\nyou let me see into your real self. I’ve often had doubts about our\nunderstanding each other, about our two natures being in that perfect\nharmony which makes the true marriage. But I’ve shut out those doubts as\ndisloyal to you. Now, you’ve forced me to see they were only too true!”",
        "“What do you mean, Janet? Of course, I’m not good enough for you–no one\nis, for that matter; but I love you, and–Do you care for me, Janet?”",
        "“Yes,” she replied mournfully. “But I must conquer it. O Arthur, Arthur!\"\nHer voice was tremulous now, and her strange hazel eyes streamed\nsorrowful reproach. “How could you think sordidly of what was sacred and\nholy to me, of what I thought was holy to us both? You couldn’t, if you\nhad been the man I imagined you were.”",
        "“Don’t blame a fellow for every loose word he utters when he’s all upset,\nJanet,” he pleaded. “Put yourself in my place. Suppose you found you\nhadn’t anything at all–found it out suddenly, when all along you had\nbeen thinking you’d never have to bother about money? Suppose you–But\nyou must know how the world, how all our friends, look on that sort of\nthing. And suppose you loved–just as I love you. Wouldn’t you go to her\nand hope she’d brace you up and make you feel that she really loved you\nand–all that? Wouldn’t you, Janet?”",
        "She looked sadly at him. “You don’t understand,” she said, her rosebud\nmouth drooping pathetically. “You can’t realize how you shook–how you\nshattered–my faith in you.”",
        "He caught her by the arms roughly. “Look here, Janet Whitney. Do you love\nme or don’t you? Do you intend to throw me over, now that I have lost my\nmoney, or do you intend to be all you’ve pretended to be?”",
        "The sadness in her sweet face deepened. “Let me go, Arthur,” she said\nquietly. “You don’t understand. You never will.”",
        "“Yes or no?” he demanded, shaking her. Then suddenly changing to\ntenderness, with all his longing for sympathy in his eyes and in his\nvoice, “Janet–dear–yes or no?”",
        "She looked away. “Don’t persist, Arthur,” she said, “or you will make me\nthink it is only my money that makes you, that made you, pretend to–to\ncare for me.”",
        "He drew back sharply. “Janet!” he exclaimed.",
        "“Of course, I don’t think so,” she continued, after a constrained\nsilence. “But I can’t find any other reason for your talking and acting\nas you have this morning.”",
        "He tried to see from her point of view. “Maybe it’s true,” he said, “that\nother things than our love have had too much to do with it, with both of\nus, in the past. But I love you for yourself alone, now, Janet. And, you\nhaven’t a fortune of your own, but only expectations–and they’re not\nalways realized, and in your case can’t be for many a year. So we don’t\nstart so unevenly. Give yourself to me, Janet. Show that you believe in\nme, and I know I shall not disappoint you.”",
        "Very manly his manner was as he said this, and brave and convincing was\nthe show of his latent, undeveloped powers in his features and voice.\nShe hesitated, then lowered her head, and, in a sad, gentle voice,\nsaid, “I don’t trust you, Arthur. You’ve cut away the foundation of\nlove. It would be fine and beautiful for us to start empty-handed and\nbuild up together, if we were in sympathy and harmony. But, doubting\nyou–I can’t.”",
        "Again he looked at her uneasily, suspicious, without knowing why or what.\nBut one thing was clear–to plead further with her would be\nself-degradation. “I have been tactless,” he said to her. “Probably, if I\nwere less in earnest, I should get on better. But, perhaps you will judge\nme more fairly when you think it over. I’ll say only one thing more. I\ncan’t give up hope. It’s about all I’ve got left–hope of you–belief in\nyou. I must cling to that. I’ll go now, Janet.”",
        "She said nothing, simply looked unutterable melancholy, and let her hand\nlie listlessly in his until he dropped it. He looked back at her when he\nreached the door. She seemed so sad that he was about to return to her\nside. She sighed heavily, gazed at him, and said, “Good-by, Arthur.\"\nAfter that he had no alternative. He went. “I must wait until she is\ncalm,” he said to himself. “She is so delicately strung.”",
        "As he was driving toward the hotel, his gloom in his face, he did not see\nMrs. Whitney dash past and give him an anxious searching glance, and sink\nback in her carriage reassured somewhat. She had heard that he was on the\nChicago express–had heard it from her masseuse, who came each morning\nbefore she was up. She had leaped to the telephone, had ordered a special\ntrain, and had got herself into it and off for her Chicago home by\nhalf-past eight. “That sentimental girl, full of high ideals–what mayn’t\nshe do!” she was muttering, almost beside herself with anxiety. “No doubt\nhe’ll try and induce her to run away with him.” And the rushing train\nseemed to creep and crawl.",
        "She burst into the house like a dignified whirlwind. “Where’s Miss\nJanet?” she demanded of the butler.",
        "“Still in the blue salon, ma’am, I think,” he replied. “Mr. Arthur\nRanger just left a few moments ago.”",
        "Clearing her surface of all traces of agitation, Mrs. Whitney went into\nthe presence of her daughter. “Mamma!” cried Janet, starting up. “Has\nanything happened?”",
        "“Nothing, nothing, dear,” replied her mother, kissing her tenderly. “I\nwas afraid my letter might have miscarried. And, when I heard that Arthur\nhad slipped away to Chicago, I came myself. I’ve brought you up so purely\nand innocently that I became alarmed lest he might lead you into some\nrash sentimentality. As I said in my letter, if Arthur had grown up into\na strong, manly character, I should have been eager to trust my daughter\nto him. But my doubts about him were confirmed by the will. And–he is\nsimply a fortune-hunter now.”",
        "Janet had hidden her face in her handkerchief. “Oh, no!” she exclaimed.\n\"You wrong him, mother.”",
        "“You haven’t encouraged him, Janet!” cried Mrs. Whitney. “After what I’ve\nbeen writing you?”",
        "“The loss of his money hasn’t made any difference about him with me,\"\nsaid Janet, her pure, sweet face lighting up with the expression that\nmade her mother half-ashamed of her own worldliness.",
        "“Of course not! Of course not, Janet,” said she. “No child of mine could\nbe mercenary without being utterly false to my teachings.”",
        "Janet’s expression was respectful, yet not confirmatory. She had often\nprotested inwardly against the sordid views of life which her mother\nunconsciously held and veiled with scant decency in the family circle in\nher unguarded moments. But she had fought against the contamination, and\nproudly felt that her battle for the “higher plane” was successful.",
        "Her mother returned, somewhat awkwardly, to the main point. “I hope you\ndidn’t encourage him, Janet.”",
        "“I don’t wish to talk of it, mother,” was Janet’s reply. “I have not been\nwell, and all this has upset me.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney was gnawing her palms with her nails and her lip with her\nteeth. She could scarcely restrain herself from seizing her daughter and\nshaking the truth, whatever it was, out of her. But prudence and respect\nfor her daughter’s delicate soul restrained her.",
        "“You have made it doubly hard for me,” Janet went on. “Your writing me to\nstay away because there was doubt about Arthur’s material future–oh,\nmother, how could that make any difference? If I had not been feeling so\ndone, and if father hadn’t been looking to me to keep him company, I’d\nsurely have gone. For I hate to have my motive misunderstood.”",
        "“He has worked on her soft-heartedness and inexperience,” thought Mrs.\nWhitney, in a panic.",
        "“And when Arthur came to-day,” the girl continued, “I was ready to fly to\nhim.” She looked tragic. “And even when he repulsed me–”",
        "“Repulsed you!” exclaimed Mrs. Whitney. She laughed disagreeably. “He’s\nsubtler than I thought.”",
        "“Even when he repulsed me,” pursued Janet, “with his sordid way of\nlooking at everything, still I tried to cling to him, to shut my eyes.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney vented an audible sigh of relief. “Then you didn’t let him\ndeceive you!”",
        "“He shattered my last illusion,” said Janet, in a mournful voice.\n\"Mother, I simply couldn’t believe in him, in the purity of his love. I\nhad to give him up.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney put her arms round her daughter and kissed her soothingly\nagain and again. “Don’t grieve, dear,” she said. “Think how much better\nit is that you should have found him out now than when it was too late.”",
        "And Janet shuddered.",
        "Ross dropped in at the house in the Lake Drive the next morning on his\nway East from the Howlands. As soon as he was alone with his mother, he\nasked, “How about Janet and Arthur?”",
        "Mrs. Whitney put on her exalted expression. “I’m glad you said nothing\nbefore Janet,” said she. “The child is so sensitive, and Arthur has given\nher a terrible shock. Men are so coarse; they do not appreciate the\ndelicateness of a refined woman. In this case, however, it was most\nfortunate. She was able to see into his true nature.”",
        "“Then she’s broken it off? That’s good.”",
        "“Be careful what you say to her,” his mother hastened to warn him. “You\nmight upset her mind again. She’s so afraid of being misunderstood.”",
        "“She needn’t be,” replied Ross dryly.",
        "And when he looked in on Janet in her sitting room to say good-by, he\nbegan with a satirical, “Congratulations, Jenny.”",
        "Jenny looked at him with wondering eyes. She was drooping like a sunless\nflower and was reading poetry out of a beautifully bound volume. “What is\nit, Ross?” she asked.",
        "“On shaking Artie so smoothly. Trust you to do the right thing at the\nright time, and in the right way. You’re a beauty, Jen, and no mistake,\"\nlaughed Ross. “I never saw your like. You really must marry a\ntitle–Madame la Duchesse! And nobody’s on to you but me. You aren’t\neven on to yourself!”",
        "Janet drew up haughtily and swept into her bedroom, closing the door with\nalmost coarse emphasis.",
        "Arthur ended his far from orderly retreat at the Auditorium, and in the\nsitting room of his suite there set about re-forming his lines, with some\nvague idea of making another attack later in the day–one less timid and\nblundering. “I’d better not have gone near her,” said he disgustedly.\n\"How could a man win when he feels beaten before he begins?” He was not\nnow hazed by Janet’s beauty and her voice like bells in evening quiet,\nand her mystic ideas. Youth, rarely wise in action, is often wise in\nthought; and Arthur, having a reasoning apparatus that worked uncommonly\nwell when he set it in motion and did not interfere with it, was soon\nseeing his situation as a whole much as it was–ugly, mocking, hopeless.",
        "“Maybe Janet knows the real reason why she’s acting this way, maybe she\ndon’t,” thought he, with the disposition of the inexperienced to give the\nbenefit of even imaginary doubt. “No matter; the fact is, it’s all up\nbetween us.” This finality, unexpectedly staring at him, gave him a\nshock. “Why,” he muttered, “she really has thrown me over! All her talk\nwas a blind–a trick.” And, further exhibiting his youth in holding the\nindividual responsible for the system of which the individual is merely a\nvictim, usually a pitiable victim, he went to the opposite extreme and\nfell to denouncing her–cold-hearted and mercenary like her mother, a\ncoward as well as a hypocrite–for, if she had had any of the bravery of\nself-respect, wouldn’t she have been frank with him? He reviewed her in\nthe flooding new light upon her character, this light that revealed her\nas mercilessly as flash of night-watchman’s lantern on guilty, shrinking\nform. “She–Why, she always was a fakir!” he exclaimed, stupefied by\nthe revelation of his own lack of discernment, he who had prided himself\non his acuteness, especially as to women. “From childhood up, she has\nalways made herself comfortable, no matter who was put out; she has\ngotten whatever she wanted, always pretending to be unselfish, always\nmaking it look as if the other person were in the wrong.” There he\nstarted up in the rate of the hoodwinked, at the recollection of an\nincident of the previous summer–how she had been most gracious to a\nyoung French nobleman, in America in search of a wife; how anybody but\n\"spiritual” Janet would have been accused of outrageous flirting–no, not\naccused, but convicted. He recalled a vague story which he had set down\nto envious gossip–a story that the Frenchman had departed on learning\nthat Charles Whitney had not yet reached the stage of fashionable\neducation at which the American father appreciates titles and begins to\nlisten without losing his temper when the subject of settlements is\nbroached. He remembered now that Janet had been low-spirited for some\ntime after the Frenchman took himself and title and eloquent eyes and\n\"soulful, stimulating conversation” to another market. “What a damn fool\nI’ve been!” Arthur all but shouted at his own image in a mirror which by\nchance was opposite him. A glance, and his eyes shifted; somehow, it gave\nhim no pleasure, but the reverse, to see that handsome face and\nwell-set-up, well-dressed figure.",
        "“She was marrying me for money,” he went on, when he had once more seated\nhimself, legs crossed and cigarette going reflectively. The idea seemed\nnew to him–that people with money could marry for money, just as a\ncapitalist goes only where he hopes to increase his capital. But on\nexamining it more closely, he was surprised to find that it was not new\nat all. “What am I so virtuous about?” said he. “Wasn’t I after money,\ntoo? If our circumstances were reversed, what would I be doing?” He\ncould find but one honest answer. “No doubt I’d be trying to get out of\nit, and if I didn’t, it’d be because I couldn’t see or make a way.” To\nhis abnormally sensitized nerves the whole business began to exude a\ndistinct, nauseating odor. “Rotten–that’s the God’s truth,” thought he.\n\"Father was right!”",
        "But there he drew back; he must be careful not to let anger sweep him\ninto conceding too much. “No–life’s got to be lived as the world\ndictates,” he hastened to add. “I see now why father did it, but he went\ntoo far. He forgot my rights. The money is mine. And, by God, I’ll get\nit!” And again he started up; and again he was caught and put out of\ncountenance by his own image in the mirror. He turned away, shamefaced,\nbut sullenly resolute.",
        "Base? He couldn’t deny it. But he was desperate; also, he had been too\nlong accustomed to grabbing things to which his conscience told him he\nhad doubtful right or none. “It’s mine. I’ve been cheated out of it. I’ll\nget it. Besides–” His mind suddenly cleared of the shadow of shame–\"I\nowe it to mother and Del to make the fight. They’ve been cheated, too.\nBecause they’re too soft-hearted and too reverent of father’s memory, is\nthat any reason, any excuse, for my shirking my duty by them? If father\nwere here to speak, I know he’d approve.” Before him rose the frightful\nlook in his father’s eyes in the earlier stage of that second and last\nillness. ’That’s what the look meant!” he cried, now completely\njustified. “He recovered his reason. He wanted to undo the mischief that\nold sneak Hargrave had drawn him into!”",
        "The case was complete: His father had been insane when he made the will,\nhad repented afterward, but had been unable to unmake it; his only son\nArthur Ranger, now head of the family, owed it to the family’s future and\nto its two helpless and oversentimental women to right the wrong. A\ncomplete case, a clear case, a solemn mandate. Interest and duty were\nsynonymous–as always to ingenious minds.",
        "He lost no time in setting about this newly discovered high task of love\nand justice. Within twenty minutes he was closeted with Dawson of the\ngreat law firm, Mitchell, Dawson, Vance & Bischoffsheimer, who had had\nthe best seats on all the fattest stranded carcasses of the Middle West\nfor a decade–that is, ever since Bischoffsheimer joined the firm and\ntaught its intellects how on a vast scale to transubstantiate technically\nlegal knowledge into technically legal wealth. Dawson–lean and keen,\ntough and brown of skin, and so carelessly dressed that he looked as if\nhe slept in his clothes–listened with the sympathetic, unwandering\nattention which men give only him who comes telling where and how they\ncan make money. The young man ended his story, all in a glow of\nenthusiasm for his exalted motives and of satisfaction with his eloquence\nin presenting them; then came the shrewd and thorough cross-examination\nwhich, he believed, strengthened every point he had made.",
        "“On your showing,” was Dawson’s cautious verdict, “you seem to have a\ncase. But you must not forget that judges and juries have a deep\nprejudice against breaking wills. They’re usually fathers themselves, and\nguard the will as the parent’s strongest weapon in keeping the children\nin order after they’re too old for the strap or the bed slat, as the case\nmay be. Undue influence or mental infirmity must be mighty clearly\nproven. Even then the court may decide to let the will stand, on general\nprinciples. Your mother and sister, of course, join you?”",
        "“I–I hope so,” hesitated Arthur. “I’m not sure.” More self-possessedly:\n\"You know how it is with women–with ladies–how they shrink from\nnotoriety.”",
        "“No, I can’t say I do,” said Dawson dryly. “Ladies need money even more\nthan women do, and so they’ll usually go the limit, and beyond, to get\nit. However, assuming that for some reason or other, your mother and\nsister won’t help, at least they won’t oppose?”",
        "“My sister is engaged to the son of Dr. Hargrave,” said Arthur uneasily.",
        "“That’s good–excellent!” exclaimed Dawson, rubbing his gaunt,\nbeard-discolored jaw vigorously.",
        "“But–he–Theodore Hargrave is a sentimental, unpractical chap.”",
        "“So are we all–but not in money matters.”",
        "“He’s an exception, I’m afraid,” said Arthur. “Really–I think it’s\nalmost certain he’ll try to influence her to take sides against me. And\nmy mother was very bitter when I spoke of contest. But, as I’ve shown\nyou, my case is quite apart from what they may or may not do.”",
        "“Um–um,” grunted Dawson. He threw himself back in his chair; to aid him\nin thinking, he twisted the only remaining crown-lock of his gray-black\nhair, and slowly drew his thin lips from his big sallow teeth, and as\nslowly returned them to place. “Obviously,” he said at length, “the\ndoctor is the crucial witness. We must see to it that\"–a significant\ngrin–\"that the other side does not attach him. We must anticipate them\nby attaching him to us. I’ll see what can be done–legitimately, you\nunderstand. Perhaps you may have to engage additional counsel–some such\nfirm as, say, Humperdink & Grafter. Often, in cases nowadays, there is\ndetail work of an important character that lawyers of our standing\ncouldn’t think of undertaking. But, of course, we work in harmony with\nsuch other counsel as our client sees fit to engage.”",
        "“Certainly; I understand,” said Arthur, with a knowing,\n\"man-of-the-world” nod. His cause being good and its triumph necessary,\nhe must not be squeamish about any alliances it might be necessary to\nmake as a means to that triumph, where the world was so wicked. “Then,\nyou undertake the case.”",
        "“We will look into it,” Dawson corrected. “You appreciate that the\nlitigation will be somewhat expensive?”",
        "Arthur reddened. No, he hadn’t thought of that! Whenever he had wanted\nanything, he had ordered it, and had let the bill go to his father;\nwhenever he had wanted money, he had sent to his father for it, and had\ngot it. Dawson’s question made the reality of his position–moneyless,\nresourceless, friendless–burst over him like a waterspout. Dawson saw\nand understood; but it was not his cue to lessen that sense of\nhelplessness.",
        "At last Arthur sufficiently shook off his stupor to say: “Unless I win\nthe contest, I shan’t have any resources beyond the five thousand I get\nunder the will, and a thousand or so I have in bank at Saint X–and what\nlittle I could realize from my personal odds and ends. Isn’t there some\nway the thing could be arranged?”",
        "“There is the method of getting a lawyer to take a case on contingent\nfee,” said Dawson. “That is, the lawyer gets a certain per cent of what\nhe wins, and nothing if he loses. But we don’t make such arrangements.\nThey are regarded as almost unprofessional; I couldn’t honestly recommend\nany lawyer who would. But, let me see–um–urn–” Dawson was reflecting\nagain, with an ostentation which might have roused the suspicions of a\nless guileless person than Arthur Ranger at twenty-five. “You could,\nperhaps, give us a retainer of say, a thousand in cash?”",
        "“Yes,” said Arthur, relieved. He thought he saw light ahead.",
        "“Then we could take your note for say, five thousand–due in eighteen\nmonths. You could renew it, if your victory was by any chance delayed\nbeyond that time.”",
        "“Your victory” was not very adroit, but it was adroit enough to bedazzle\nArthur. “Certainly,” said he gratefully.",
        "Dawson shut his long, wild-looking teeth and gently drew back his dry,\nbeard-discolored lips, while his keen eyes glinted behind his spectacles.\nThe fly had a leg in the web!",
        "Business being thus got into a smooth way, Dawson and Arthur became great\nfriends. Nothing that Dawson said was a specific statement of belief in\nthe ultimate success of the suit; but his every look and tone implied\nconfidence. Arthur went away with face radiant and spirit erect. He felt\nthat he was a man of affairs, a man of consequence, he had lawyers, and a\nbig suit pending; and soon he would be rich. He thought of Janet, and\naudibly sneered. “I’ll make the Whitneys sick of their treachery!” said\nhe. Back had come his sense of strength and superiority; and once more he\nwas “gracious” with servants and with such others of the “peasantry” as\nhappened into or near his homeward path.",
        "Toward three o’clock that afternoon, as he was being whirled toward Saint\nX in the Eastern Express, his lawyer was in the offices of Ramsay &\nVanorden, a rival firm of wreckers and pirate outfitters on the third\nfloor of the same building. When Dawson had despatched his immediate\nbusiness with Vanorden, he lingered to say: “Well, I reckon we’ll soon be\nlined up on opposite sides in another big suit.”",
        "Confidences between the two firms were frequent and natural–not only\nbecause Vanorden and Dawson were intimate friends and of the greatest\nassistance each to the other socially and politically; not only because\nRamsay and Bischoffsheimer had married sisters; but also, and chiefly,\nbecause big lawyers like to have big lawyers opposed to them in a big\nsuit. For several reasons; for instance, ingenuity on each side prolongs\nthe litigation and makes it intricate, and therefore highly expensive,\nand so multiplies the extent of the banquet.",
        "“How so?” inquired Vanorden, put on the alert by the significant\nintonation of his friend.",
        "“The whole Ranger-Whitney business is coming into court. Ranger, you\nknow, passed over the other day. He cut his family off with almost\nnothing–gave his money to Tecumseh College. The son’s engaged us to\nattack the will.”",
        "“Where do we come in?” asked Vanorden.",
        "Dawson laughed and winked. “I guess your client, old Charley Whitney,\nwon’t miss the chance to intervene in the suit and annex the whole\nbusiness, in the scrimmage.”",
        "Vanorden nodded. “Oh, I see,” said he. “I see! Yes, we’ll take a\nhand–sure!”",
        "“There won’t be much in it for us,” continued Dawson. “The boy’s got\nnothing, and between you and me, Len, the chances are against him. But\nyou fellows and whoever gets the job of defending the college’s rights–\"\nDawson opened his arms and made a humorous, huge, in-sweeping gesture.\n\"And,” he added, “Whitney’s one of the trustees under the will. See?”",
        "“Thanks, old man.” Vanorden was laughing like a shrewd and mischievous\nbut through-and-through good-natured boy. The two brilliant young leaders\nof the Illinois bar shook hands warmly.",
        "And so it came about that Charles Whitney was soon indorsing a plan to\ncause, and to profit by, sly confusion–the plan of his able lawyers.\nThey had for years steered his hardy craft, now under the flag of\npeaceful commerce and now under the black banner of the buccaneer. The\nbest of pilots, they had enabled him to clear many a shoal of bankruptcy,\nmany a reef of indictment. They served well, for he paid well.",
        "By the time he reached Saint X our young “man of affairs” believed his\nconscience soundly converted to his adventure; and, as he drove toward\nthe house, a final survey of his defenses and justifications satisfied\nhim that they were impregnable. Nevertheless, as he descended from the\nstation hack and entered the grounds of the place that in his heart of\nheart was all that the word “home” can contain, he felt strangely like a\ntraitor and a sneak. He kept his manner of composed seriousness, but he\nreasoned in vain against those qualms of shame and panic. At the open\nfront door he dared not lift his eyes lest he should be overwhelmed by\nthe sight of that colossal figure, with a look in its face that would\nforce him to see the truth about his thoughts and his acts. The house\nseemed deserted; on the veranda that opened out from the back parlor he\nfound Dory Hargrave, reading. He no longer felt bitter toward Dory.\nThinking over the whole of the Ranger-Whitney relations and the sudden\ndouble break in them, he had begun to believe that perhaps Adelaide had\nhad the good luck to make an extremely clever stroke when she shifted\nfrom Ross Whitney to Hargrave. Anyhow, Dory was a fine fellow, both in\nlooks and in brains, with surprisingly good, yes, really amazing air and\nmanner–considering his opportunities; he’d be an ornament to any family\nas soon as he had money enough properly to equip himself–which would be\nvery soon, now that the great Dawson was about to open fire on the will\nand demolish it.",
        "“Howdy,” he accordingly said, with only a shade less than his old\nfriendliness, and that due to embarrassment, and not at all to ill\nfeeling. “Where’s mother–and Del?”",
        "“Your sister has taken your mother for a drive,” replied Hargrave.",
        "“Smoke?” said Arthur, extending his gold cigarette case, open.",
        "Dory preferred his own brand of cigarettes; but, feeling that he ought to\nmeet any advance of Arthur’s, he took one of the big, powerful Egyptians\nwith “A.K.” on it in blue monogram. They smoked in silence a moment or\nso, Arthur considering whether to practise on Dory the story of his\nproposed contest, to enable him to tell it in better form to his mother\nand sister. “I’ve been to Chicago to see about contesting the will,” he\nbegan, deciding for the rehearsal.",
        "“I supposed so,” said Hargrave.",
        "“Of course, for mother’s and Del’s sake I simply have to do it,” he went\non, much encouraged. “Anyone who knew father knows he must have been out\nof his mind when he made that will.”",
        "“I see your point of view,” said Dory, embarrassed. Then, with an effort\nhe met Arthur’s eyes, but met them fearlessly. “You misunderstood me. I\nthink a contest is a mistake.”",
        "Arthur flamed. “Naturally you defend your father,” he sneered.",
        "“Let us leave my father out of this,” said Dory. His manner made it\nimpossible for Arthur to persist. For Dory was one of those who have\nthe look of “peace with honor” that keeps to bounds even the man\ncrazed by anger.",
        "“You can’t deny I have a legal right to make the contest,” pursued\nArthur.",
        "“Undoubtedly.”",
        "“And a moral right, too,” said Arthur, somewhat defiantly.",
        "“Yes,” assented Dory. The tone of the “yes\"–or was it Arthur’s own\nself-respect–made him suspect Dory of thinking that a man might have the\nclearest legal and moral right and still not be able to get his honor’s\nconsent. “But why discuss the matter, Arthur? You couldn’t be changed by\nanything I’d say.”",
        "“We will discuss it!” exclaimed Arthur furiously. “I see what your plan\nis. You know I’m bound to win; so you’ll try to influence Del and mother\nagainst me, and get the credit for taking high ground, and at the same\ntime get the benefit of the breaking of the will. When the will’s broken,\nmother’ll have her third; you think you can stir up a quarrel between her\nand me, and she’ll leave all of her third to Del and you.”",
        "Arthur had started up threateningly. There showed at his eyes and mouth\nthe ugliest of those alien passions which his associations had thrust\ninto him, and which had been master ever since the reading of the will.\nThe signs were all for storm; but Dory sat impassive. He looked steadily\nat Arthur until Arthur could no longer withstand, but had to drop his\neyes. Then he said: “I want you to think over what you have just said to\nme, Artie–especially your calculations on the death of your mother.”",
        "Arthur dropped back into his chair.",
        "“Honestly, Artie, honestly,” Dory went on, with the friendliest\nearnestness, “isn’t there something wrong about anything that causes the\nman you are by nature to think and feel and talk that way, when his\nfather is not a week dead?”",
        "Arthur forced a sneer, but without looking at Dory.",
        "“Do you remember the day of the funeral?” Dory went on. “It had been\nannounced in the papers that the burial would be private. As we drove out\nof the front gates there, I looked round–you remember it was raining.\nThere were uncovered farm wagons blocking the streets up and down. There\nwere thousands of people standing in the rain with bared heads. And I saw\ntears thick as the rain drops streaming down faces of those who had known\nyour father as boy and man, who had learned to know he was all that a\nhuman being should be.”",
        "Arthur turned away to hide his features from Dory.",
        "“That was your father, Artie. What if he could have heard you a few\nminutes ago?”",
        "“I don’t need to have anyone praise my father to me,” said Arthur,\ntrying to mask his feelings behind anger. “And what you say is no reason\nwhy I should let mother and Del and myself be cheated out of what he\nwanted us to have.”",
        "Dory left it to Arthur’s better self to discuss that point with him. “I\nknow you’ll do what is right,” said he sincerely. “You are more like\nyour father than you suspect as yet, Artie. I should have said nothing\nto you if you hadn’t forced your confidence on me. What I’ve said is\nonly what you’d say to me, were I in your place and you in mine–what\nyou’ll think yourself a month from now. What lawyer advised you to\nundertake the contest?”",
        "“Dawson of Mitchell, Dawson, Vance & Bischoffsheimer. As good lawyers as\nthere are in the country.”",
        "“I ought to tell you,” said Dory, after brief hesitation, “that Judge\nTorrey calls them a quartette of unscrupulous scoundrels–says they’re\nregarded as successful only because success has sunk to mean supremacy in\ncheating and double-dealing. Would you mind telling me what terms they\ngave you–about fee and expenses?”",
        "“A thousand down, and a note for five thousand,” replied Arthur,\ncompelled to speech by the misgivings Dory was raising within him in\nspite of himself.",
        "“That is, as the first installment, they take about all the money in\nsight. Does that look as if they believed in the contest?”",
        "At this Arthur remembered and understood Dawson’s remark, apparently\ncasual, but really crucial, about the necessity of attaching Dr. Schulze.\nWithout Schulze, he had no case; and Dawson had told him so! What kind of\na self-hypnotized fool was he, not to hear the plainest warnings? And\nwithout waiting to see Schulze, he had handed over his money!",
        "“I know you think I am not unprejudiced about this will,” Dory went on.\n\"But I ask you to have a talk with Judge Torrey. While he made the will,\nit was at your father’s command, and he didn’t and doesn’t approve it. He\nknows all the circumstances. Before you go any further, wouldn’t it be\nwell to see him? You know there isn’t an abler lawyer, and you also know\nhe’s honest. If there’s any way of breaking the will, he’ll tell you\nabout it.”",
        "Hiram Ranger’s son now had the look of his real self emerging from the\nsubsiding fumes of his debauch of folly and fury. “Thank you, Hargrave,\"\nhe said. “You are right.”",
        "“Go straight off,” advised Dory. “Go before you’ve said anything to your\nmother about what you intend to do. And please let me say one thing more.\nSuppose you do finally decide to make this contest. It means a year, two\nyears, three years, perhaps five or six, perhaps ten or more, of\nsuspense, of degrading litigation, with the best of you shriveling, with\nyour abilities to do for yourself paralyzed. If you finally lose–you’ll\nowe those Chicago sharks an enormous sum of money, and you’ll be\nembittered and blighted for life. If you win, they and their pals will\nhave most of the estate; you will have little but the barren victory; and\nyou will have lost your mother. For, Arthur, if you try to prove that\nyour father was insane, and cut off his family in insane anger, you know\nit will kill her.”",
        "A long silence; then Arthur moved toward the steps leading down to the\ndrive. “I’ll think it over,” he said, in a tone very different from any\nhe had used before.",
        "Dory watched him depart with an expression of friendship and admiration.\n\"He’s going to Judge Torrey,” he said to himself. “Scratch that veneer of\nhis, and you find his mother and father.”",
        "The old judge received Arthur like a son, listened sympathetically as the\nyoung man gave him in detail the interview with Dawson. Even as Arthur\nrecalled and related, he himself saw Dawson’s duplicity; for, that past\nmaster of craft had blundered into the commonest error of craft of all\ndegrees–he had underestimated the intelligence of the man he was trying\nto cozen. He, rough in dress and manners and regarding “dudishness” as\nunfailing proof of weak-mindedness, had set down the fashionable Arthur,\nwith his Harvard accent and his ignorance of affairs, as an unmitigated\nass. He had overlooked the excellent natural mind which false education\nand foolish associations had tricked out in the motley, bells and bauble\nof “culture\"; and so, he had taken no pains to cozen artistically. Also,\nas he thought greediness the strongest and hardiest passion in all human\nbeings, because it was so in himself, he had not the slightest fear that\nanyone or anything could deflect his client from pursuing the fortune\nwhich dangled, or seemed to dangle, tantalizingly near.",
        "Arthur, recalling the whole interview, was accurate where he had been\nvisionary, intelligent where he had been dazed. He saw it all, before he\nwas half done; he did not need Torrey’s ejaculated summary: “The\nswindling scoundrel!” to confirm him.",
        "“You signed the note?” said the judge.",
        "“Yes,” replied Arthur. He laughed with the frankness of self-derision\nthat augurs so well for a man’s teachableness.",
        "“He must have guessed,” continued the judge, “that a contest is useless.”",
        "At that last word Arthur changed expression, changed color–or, rather,\nlost all color. “Useless?” he repeated, so overwhelmed that he clean\nforgot pride of appearances and let his feelings have full play in his\nface. Useless! A contest useless. Then–",
        "“I did have some hopes,” interrupted Judge Torrey’s deliberate, judicial\ntones, “but I had to give them up after I talked with Schulze and\nPresident Hargrave. Your father may have been somewhat precipitate,\nArthur, but he was sane when he made that will. He believed his wealth\nwould be a curse to his children. And–I ain’t at all sure he wasn’t\nright. As I look round this town, this whole country, and see how the\nsecond generation of the rich is rotten with the money-cancer, I feel\nthat your grand, wise father had one of the visions that come only to\nthose who are about to leave the world and have their eyes cleared of the\ndust of the combat, and their minds cooled of its passions.” Here the old\nman leaned forward and laid his hand on the knee of the white, haggard\nyouth. “Arthur,” he went on, “your father’s mind may have been befogged\nby his affections in the years when he was letting his children do as\nthey pleased, do like most children of the rich. And his mind may have\nbeen befogged by his affections again, after he made that will and went\ndown into the Dark Valley. But, I tell you, boy, he was sane when he\nmade that will. He was saner than most men have the strength of mind to\nbe on the best day of their whole lives.”",
        "Arthur was sitting with elbows on the desk; his face stared out, somber\nand gaunt, from between his hands. “How much he favors his father,\"\nthought the old judge. “What a pity it don’t go any deeper than looks.\"\nBut the effect of the resemblance was sufficient to make it impossible\nfor him to offer any empty phrases of cheer and consolation. After a long\ntime the hopeless, dazed expression slowly faded from the young man’s\nface; in its place came a calm, inscrutable look. The irresponsible boy\nwas dead; the man had been born–in rancorous bitterness, but in strength\nand decision.",
        "It was the man who said, as he rose to depart, “I’ll write Dawson that\nI’ve decided to abandon the contest.”",
        "“Ask him to return the note,” advised Torrey. “But,” he added, “I doubt\nif he will.”",
        "“He won’t,” said Arthur. “And I’ll not ask him. Anyhow, a few dollars\nwould be of no use to me. I’d only prolong the agony of getting down to\nwhere I’ve got to go.”",
        "“Five thousand dollars is right smart of money,” protested the judge. “On\nsecond thought, I guess you’d better let me negotiate with him.” The old\nman’s eyes were sparkling with satisfaction in the phrases that were\nforming in his mind for the first letter to Dawson.",
        "“Thank you,” said Arthur. But it was evident that he was not\ninterested. “I must put the past behind me,” he went on presently. “I\nmustn’t think of it.”",
        "“After all,” suggested Torrey, “you’re not as bad off as more than\nninety-nine per cent of the young men. You’re just where they are–on bed\nrock. And you’ve got the advantage of your education.”",
        "Arthur smiled satirically. “The tools I learned to use at college,” said\nhe, “aren’t the tools for the Crusoe Island I’ve been cast away on.”",
        "“Well, I reckon a college don’t ruin a young chap with the right stuff in\nhim, even if it don’t do him any great sight of good.” He looked uneasily\nat Arthur, then began: “If you’d like to study law\"–as if he feared the\noffer would be accepted, should he make it outright.",
        "“No; thank you, I’ve another plan,” replied Arthur, though “plan” would\nhave seemed to Judge Torrey a pretentious name for the hazy possibilities\nthat were beginning to gather in the remote corners of his mind.",
        "“I supposed you wouldn’t care for the law,” said Torrey, relieved that\nhis faint hint of a possible offer had not got him into trouble. He liked\nArthur, but estimated him by his accent and his dress, and so thought him\nprobably handicapped out of the running by those years of training for a\ncareer of polite uselessness. “That East!” he said to himself, looking\npityingly at the big, stalwart youth in the elaborate fopperies of\nfashionable mourning. “That damned East! We send it most of our money\nand our best young men; and what do we get from it in return? Why, sneers\nand snob-ideas.” However, he tried to change his expression to one less\ndiscouraging; but his face could not wholly conceal his forebodings.\n\"It’s lucky for the boy,” he reflected, “that Hiram left him a good home\nas long as his mother’s alive. After she’s gone–and the five thousand,\nif I get it back–I suppose he’ll drop down and down, and end by clerking\nit somewhere.” With a survey of Arthur’s fashionable attire, “I should\nsay he might do fairly well in a gent’s furnishing store in one of those\ndamn cities.” The old man was not unfeeling–far from it; he had simply\nbeen educated by long years of experience out of any disposition to\nexaggerate the unimportant in the facts of life. “He’ll be better off and\nmore useful as a clerk than he would be as a pattern of damnfoolishness\nand snobbishness. So, Hiram was right anyway I look at it, and no matter\nhow it comes out. But–it did take courage to make that will!”",
        "“Well, good day, judge,” Arthur was saying, to end both their reveries.\n\"I must,” he laughed curtly, “’get a move on.’”",
        "“Good day, and God bless you, boy,” said the old man, with a hearty\nearnestness that, for the moment, made Arthur’s eyes less hard. “Take\nyour time, settling on what to do. Don’t be in a hurry.”",
        "“On the contrary,” said Arthur. “I’m going to make up my mind at once.\nNothing stales so quickly as a good resolution.”",
        "A crisis does not create character, but is simply its test. The young man\nwho entered the gates of No. 64 Jefferson Street at five that afternoon\nwas in all respects he who left them at a quarter before four, though he\nseemed very different to himself. He went direct to his own room and did\nnot descend until the supper bell sounded–that funny little old jangling\nbell he and Del had striven to have abolished in the interests of\nfashionable progress, until they learned that in many of the best English\nhouses it is a custom as sacredly part of the ghostly British\nConstitution as the bathless bath of the basin, as the jokeless joke of\nthe pun, as the entertainment that entertains not, as the ruler that\nrules not and the freedom that frees not. When he appeared in the\ndining-room door, his mother and Del were already seated. His mother, her\nwhite face a shade whiter, said: “I expect you’d better sit–there.” She\nneither pointed nor looked, but they understood that she meant Hiram’s\nplace. It was her formal announcement of her forgiveness and of her\nrecognition of the new head of the family. With that in his face that\ngave Adelaide a sense of the ending of a tension within her, he seated\nhimself where his father had always sat.",
        "It was a silent supper, each one absorbed in thoughts which could not\nhave been uttered, no one able to find any subject that would not make\noverwhelming the awful sense of the one that was not there and never\nagain would be. Mrs. Ranger spoke once. “How did you find Janet?” she\nsaid to Arthur.",
        "His face grew red, with gray underneath. After a pause he answered:\n\"Very well.” Another pause, then: “Our engagement is broken off.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger winced and shrank. She knew how her question and the effort\nof that answer must have hurt the boy; but she did not make matters worse\nwith words. Indeed, she would have been unable to say anything, for\nsympathy would have been hypocritical, and hypocrisy was with her\nimpossible. She thought Arthur loved Janet; she realized, too, the savage\nwound to his pride in losing her just at this time. But she had never\nliked her, and now felt justified in that secret and, so she had often\nreproached herself, unreasonable dislike; and she proceeded to hate her,\nthe first time she had ever hated anybody–to hate her as a mother can\nhate one who has made her child suffer.",
        "After supper, Mrs. Ranger plunged into the household duties that were\nsaving her from insanity. Adelaide and Arthur went to the side veranda.\nWhen Arthur had lighted a cigarette, he looked at it with a grim\nsmile–it was astonishing how much stronger and manlier his face was, all\nin a few hours. “I’m on my last thousand of these,” said he. “After them,\nno more cigarettes.”",
        "“Oh, it isn’t so bad as all that!” said Adelaide. “We’re still\ncomfortable, and long before you could feel any change, you’ll be making\nplenty of money.”",
        "“I’m going to work–next Monday–at the mills.”",
        "Adelaide caught her breath, beamed on him. “I knew you would!” she\nexclaimed. “I knew you were brave.”",
        "“Brave!” He laughed disagreeably. “Like the fellow that faces the fight\nbecause a bayonet’s pricking his back. I can’t go away somewhere and get\na job, for there’s nothing I can do. I’ve got to stay right here. I’ve\ngot to stare this town out of countenance. I’ve got to get it used to the\nidea of me as a common workingman with overalls and a dinner pail.”",
        "She saw beneath his attempt to make light of the situation a deep and\ncruel humiliation. He was looking forward to the keenest torture to which\na man trained in vanity to false ideals can be subjected; and the thing\nitself, so Adelaide was thinking, would be more cruel than his writhing\nanticipation of it.",
        "“Still,” she insisted to him, “you are brave. You might have borrowed of\nmother and gone off to make one failure after another in gentlemanly\nattempts. You might have\"–she was going to say, “tried to make a rich\nmarriage,” but stopped herself in time. “Oh, I forgot,” she said,\ninstead, “there’s the five thousand dollars. Why not spend it in studying\nlaw–or something?”",
        "“I’ve lost my five thousand,” he replied. “I paid it for a lesson that\nwas cheap at the price.” Then, thoughtfully, “I’ve dropped out of the\nclass ’gentleman’ for good and all.”",
        "“Or into it,” suggested she.",
        "He disregarded this; he knew it was an insincerity–one of the many he\nand Del were now trying to make themselves believe against the almost\nhopeless handicap of the unbelief they had acquired as part of their\n\"Eastern culture.” He went on: “There’s one redeeming feature of the–the\nsituation.”",
        "“Only one?”",
        "“And that for you,” he said. “At least, you’ve got a small income.”",
        "“But I haven’t,” she replied. “Dory made me turn it over to mother.”",
        "Arthur stared. “Dory!”",
        "“Yes,” she answered, with a nod and a smile. It would have given Dory a\nsurprise, a vastly different notion as to what she thought of him, had he\nseen her unawares just then.",
        "“Made you?”",
        "“Made,” she repeated.",
        "“And you did it?”",
        "“I’ve promised I will.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“I don’t just know,” was her slow reply.",
        "“Because he was afraid it might make bad blood between you and me?”",
        "“That was one of the reasons he urged,” she admitted. “But he thought,\ntoo, it would be bad for him and me.”",
        "A long silence. Then Arthur: “Del, I almost think you’re not making such\na mistake as I feared, in marrying him.”",
        "“So do I–sometimes,” was his sister’s, to him, astonishing answer, in an\nabsent, speculative tone.",
        "Arthur withheld the question that was on his lips. He looked curiously at\nthe small graceful head, barely visible in the deepening twilight. “She’s\na strange one,” he reflected. “I don’t understand her–and I doubt if she\nunderstands herself.”",
        "And that last was very near to the truth. Everyone has a reason for\neverything he does; but it by no means follows that he always knows\nthat reason, or even could extricate it from the tangle of motives,\nreal and reputed, behind any given act. This self-ignorance is less\ncommon among men than among women, with their deliberate training to\nself-consciousness and to duplicity; it is most common among those–men\nas well as women–who think about themselves chiefly. And Adelaide,\nhaving little to think about when all her thinking was hired out, had of\nnecessity thought chiefly about herself.",
        "“You guessed that Janet has thrown me over?” Arthur said, to open the way\nfor relieving his mind.",
        "Adelaide made a gallant effort, and her desire to console him conquered\nher vanity. “Just as Ross threw me over,” she replied, with a successful\nimitation of indifference.",
        "Instead of being astonished at the news, Arthur was astonished at his not\nhaving guessed it. His first sensation was the very human one of\npleasure–the feeling that he had companionship in humiliation. He moved\ncloser to her. Then came an instinct, perhaps true, perhaps false, that\nshe was suffering, that Ross had wounded her cruelly, that she was not so\ncalm as her slim, erect figure seemed in the deep dusk. He burst out in\nquiet, intense fury: “Del, I’ll make those two wish to God they hadn’t!”",
        "“You can’t do it, Artie,” she replied. “The only power on earth that can\ndo them up is themselves.” She paused to vent the laugh that was as\nnatural in the circumstances as it was unpleasant to hear. “And I think\nthey’ll do it,” she went on, “without any effort on your part–or mine.”",
        "“You do not hate them as I do,” said he.",
        "“I’m afraid I’m not a good hater,” she answered. “I admit I’ve got a sore\nspot where he–struck me. But as far as he’s concerned, I honestly\nbelieve I’m already feeling a little bit obliged to him.”",
        "“Naturally,” said he in a tone that solicited confidences. “Haven’t you\ngot what you really wanted?”",
        "But his sister made no reply.",
        "“Look here, Del,” he said after waiting in vain, “if you don’t want to\nmarry, there’s no reason why you should. You’ll soon see I’m not as\ngood-for-nothing as some people imagine.”",
        "“What makes you think I don’t want to marry?” asked Adelaide, her face\ncompletely hid by the darkness, her voice betraying nothing.",
        "“Why, what you’ve been saying–or, rather, what you’ve not been\nsaying.”",
        "A very long silence, then out of the darkness came Adelaide’s voice,\neven, but puzzling. “Well, Artie, I’ve made up my mind to marry. I’ve got\nto do something, and Dory’ll give me something to do. If I sat about\nwaiting, waiting, and thinking, thinking, I should do–something\ndesperate. I’ve got to get away from myself. I’ve got to forget myself.\nI’ve got to get a new self.”",
        "“Just as I have,” said Arthur.",
        "Presently he sat on the arm of her chair and reached out for her hand\nwhich was seeking his.",
        "When Hiram was first stricken, Adelaide’s Simeon had installed himself as\nattendant-in-chief. The others took turns at nursing; Simeon was on duty\nevery hour of every twenty-four. He lost all interest in Adelaide, in\neverything except the sick man. Most of the time he sat quietly, gazing\nat the huge, helpless object of his admiration as if fascinated. Whenever\nHiram deigned to look at him, he chattered softly, timidly approached,\nretreated, went through all his tricks, watching the while for some sign\nof approval. The first week or so, Hiram simply tolerated the pathetic\nremembrancer to human humility because he did not wish to chagrin his\ndaughter. But it is not in nature to resist a suit so meek, so\npersistent, and so unasking as Simeon’s. Soon Hiram liked to have his\nadorer on his knee, on the arm of his chair, on the table beside him;\noccasionally he moved his unsteady hand slowly to Simeon’s head to give\nit a pat. And in the long night hours of wakefulness there came to be a\nsoothing companionship in the sound of Simeon’s gentle breathing in the\nlittle bed at the head of his bed; for Simeon would sleep nowhere else.",
        "The shy races of mankind, those that hide their affections and rarely\ngive them expression, are fondest of domestic animals, because to them\nthey can show themselves without fear of being laughed at or repulsed.\nBut it happened that Hiram had never formed a friendship with a dog. In\nhis sickness and loneliness, he was soon accepting and returning Simeon’s\nfondness in kind. And at the time when a man must re-value everything in\nlife and put a proper estimate upon it, this unselfish, incessant, wholly\ndisinterested love of poor Simeon’s gave him keen pleasure and content.\nAfter the stroke that entombed him, some subtle instinct seemed to guide\nSimeon when to sit and sympathize at a distance, when to approach and\ngive a gentle caress, with tears running from his eyes. But the death\nSimeon did not understand at all. Those who came to make the last\narrangements excited him to fury. Adelaide had to lock him in her\ndressing room until the funeral was over. When she released him, he flew\nto the room where he had been accustomed to sit with his great and good\nfriend. No Hiram! He ran from room to room, chattering wildly, made the\ntour of gardens and outbuildings, returned to the room in which his quest\nhad started. He seemed dumb with despair. He had always looked\nludicrously old and shriveled; his appearance now became tragic. He would\nstart up from hours of trancelike motionlessness, would make a tour of\nhouse and grounds; scrambling and shambling from place to place;\nchattering at doors he could not open, then pausing to listen; racing to\nthe front fence and leaping to its top to crane up and down the street;\nalways back in the old room in a few minutes, to resume his watch and\nwait. He would let no one but Adelaide touch him, and he merely endured\nher; good and loving though she seemed to be, he felt that she was\nsomehow responsible for the mysterious vanishing of his god while she had\nhim shut away.",
        "Sometimes in the dead of night, Adelaide or Arthur or Mrs. Ranger,\nwaking, would hear him hurrying softly, like a ghost, along the halls or\nup and down the stairs. They, with the crowding interests that compel the\nmind, no matter how fiercely the bereaved heart may fight against\nintrusion, would forget for an hour now and then the cause of the black\nshadow over them and all the house and all the world; and as the weeks\npassed their grief softened and their memories of the dead man began to\ngive them that consoling illusion of his real presence. But not Simeon;\nhe could think only that his friend had been there and was gone.",
        "At last the truth in some form must have come to him. For he gave up the\nsearch and the hope, and lay down to die. Food he would not touch; he\nneither moved nor made a sound. When Adelaide took him up, he lifted dim\ntragic eyes to her for an instant, then sank back as if asleep. One\nmorning, they found him in Hiram’s great arm chair, huddled in its\ndepths, his head upon his knees, his hairy hands stiff against his\ncheeks. They buried him in the clump of lilac bushes of which Hiram had\nbeen especially fond.",
        "Stronger than any other one influence for good upon Adelaide and Arthur\nat that critical time, was this object lesson Simeon gave–Simeon with\nhis single-hearted sorrow and single-minded love.",
        "Arthur, about to issue forth at a quarter to seven on Monday morning to\nbegin work as a cooper’s apprentice, felt as if he would find all Saint X\nlined up to watch him make the journey in working clothes. He had a bold\nfront as he descended the lawn toward the gates; but at the risk of\nopening him to those with no sympathy for weaknesses other than their\nown, and for their own only in themselves, it must be set down that he\nseemed to himself to be shaking and skulking. He set his teeth together,\ngave himself a final savage cut with the lash of “What a damned coward I\nam!” and closed the gate behind him and was in the street–a workingman.\nHe did not realize it, but he had shown his mettle; for, no man with any\nreal cowardice anywhere in him would have passed through that gate and\nfaced a world that loves to sneer.",
        "From the other big houses of that prosperous neighborhood were coming,\nalso in working clothes, the fathers, and occasionally the sons, of\nfamilies he was accustomed to regard as “all right–for Saint X.” At the\ncorner of Cherry Lane, old Bolingbroke, many times a millionaire thanks\nto a thriving woolen factory, came up behind him and cried out, ’Well,\nyoung man! This is something like.” In his enthusiasm he put his arm\nthrough Arthur’s. “As soon as I read your father’s will, I made one\nmyself,” he continued as they hurried along at Bolingbroke’s always\nfurious speed. “I always did have my boys at work; I send ’em down half\nan hour before me every morning. But it occurred to me they might bury\ntheir enthusiasm in the cemetery along with me.” He gave his crackling,\nsnapping laugh that was strange and even startling in itself, but seemed\nthe natural expression of his snapping eyes and tight-curling, wiry\nwhiskers and hair. “So I fixed up my will. No pack of worthless heirs to\nmake a mockery of my life and teachings after I’m gone. No, sir-ee!”",
        "Arthur was more at ease. “Appearances” were no longer against\nhim–distinctly the reverse. He wondered that his vanity could have made\nhim overlook the fact that what he was about to do was as much the\nregular order in prosperous Saint X, throughout the West for that matter,\nas posing as a European gentleman was the regular order of the “upper\nclasses” of New York and Boston–and that even there the European\ngentleman was a recent and rather rare importation. And Bolingbroke’s\nhearty admiration, undeserved though Arthur felt it to be, put what he\nthought was nerve into him and stimulated what he then regarded as pride.\n\"After all, I’m not really a common workman,” reflected he. “It’s like\nmother helping Mary.” And he felt still better when, passing the little\nmillinery shop of “Wilmot & Company” arm in arm with the great woolen\nmanufacturer, he saw Estelle Wilmot–sweeping out. Estelle would have\nlooked like a storybook princess about royal business, had she been down\non her knees scrubbing a sidewalk. He was glad she didn’t happen to see\nhim, but he was gladder that he had seen her. Clearly, toil was beginning\nto take on the appearance of “good form.”",
        "He thought pretty well of himself all that day. Howells treated him like\nthe proprietor’s son; Pat Waugh, foreman of the cooperage, put “Mr.\nArthur” or “Mr. Ranger” into every sentence; the workingmen addressed him\nas “sir,” and seemed to appreciate his talking as affably with them as if\nhe were unaware of the precipice of caste which stretched from him down\nto them. He was in a pleasant frame of mind as he went home and bathed\nand dressed for dinner. And, while he knew he had really been in the way\nat the cooperage and had earned nothing, yet–his ease about his social\nstatus permitting–he felt a sense of self-respect which was of an\nentirely new kind, and had the taste of the fresh air of a keen, clear\nwinter day.",
        "This, however, could not last. The estate was settled up; the fiction\nthat he was of the proprietorship slowly yielded to the reality; the\nmen, not only those over him but also those on whose level he was\nsupposed to be, began to judge him as a man. “The boys say,” growled\nWaugh to Howells, “that he acts like one of them damn spying dude sons\nproprietors sometimes puts in among the men to learn how to work ’em\nharder for less. He don’t seem to catch on that he’s got to get his\nmoney out of his own hands.”",
        "“Touch him up a bit,” said Howells, who had worshiped Hiram Ranger and in\na measure understood what had been in his mind when he dedicated his son\nto a life of labor. “If it becomes absolutely necessary I’ll talk to him.\nBut maybe you can do the trick.”",
        "Waugh, who had the useful man’s disdain of deliberately useless men and\nthe rough man’s way of feeling it and showing it, was not slow to act on\nHowells’s license. That very day he found Arthur unconsciously and even\npatronizingly shirking the tending of a planer so that his teacher, Bud\nRollins, had to do double work. Waugh watched this until it had “riled\"\nhim sufficiently to loosen his temper and his language. “Hi, there,\nRanger!” he shouted. “What the hell! You’ve been here goin’ on six months\nnow, and you’re more in the way than you was the first day.”",
        "Arthur flushed, flashed, clenched his fists; but the planer was between\nhim and Waugh, and that gave Waugh’s tremendous shoulders and fists a\nchance to produce a subduing visual impression. A man, even a young man,\nwho is nervous on the subject of his dignity, will, no matter how brave\nand physically competent, shrink from avoidable encounter that means\ndoubtful battle. And dignity was a grave matter with young Ranger in\nthose days.",
        "“Don’t hoist your dander up at me,” said Waugh. “Get it up agin’\nyourself. Bud, next time he soldiers on you, send him to me.”",
        "“All right, sir,” replied Bud, with a soothing grin. And when Waugh was\ngone, he said to Arthur, “Don’t mind him. Just keep pegging along, and\nyou’ll learn all right.”",
        "Bud’s was the tone a teacher uses to encourage a defective child. It\nstung Arthur more fiercely than had Waugh’s. It flashed on him that the\nmen–well, they certainly hadn’t been looking up to him as he had been\nfondly imagining. He went at his work resolutely, but blunderingly; he\nspoiled a plank and all but clogged the machine. His temper got clean\naway from him, and he shook with a rage hard to restrain from venting\nitself against the inanimate objects whose possessing devils he could\nhear jeering at him through the roar of the machinery.",
        "“Steady! Steady!” warned good-natured Rollins. “You’ll drop a hand under\nthat knife.”",
        "The words had just reached Arthur when he gave a sharp cry. With a cut\nas clean as the edge that made it, off came the little finger of his\nleft hand, and he was staring at it as it lay upon the bed of the\nplaner, twitching, seeming to breathe as its blood pulsed out, while the\nblood spurted from his maimed hand. In an instant Lorry Tague had the\nmachine still.",
        "“A bucket of clean water,” he yelled to the man at the next planer.",
        "He grabbed dazed Arthur’s hand, and pressed hard with his powerful thumb\nand forefinger upon the edges of the wound.",
        "“A doctor!” he shouted at the men crowding round.",
        "Arthur did not realize what had happened until he found himself forced to\nhis knees, his hand submerged in the ice-cold water, Lorry still holding\nshut the severed veins and arteries.",
        "“Another bucket of water, you, Bill,” cried Lorry.",
        "When it came he had Bill Johnstone throw the severed finger into it. Bud\nRollins, who had jumped through the window into the street in a dash for\na physician, saw Doctor Schulze’s buggy just turning out of High Street.\nHe gave chase, had Schulze beside Arthur within two minutes. More water,\nboth hot and cold, was brought, and a cleared work bench; with swift,\nsure fingers the doctor cleaned the stump, cleaned the severed finger,\njoined and sewed them, bandaged the hand.",
        "“Now, I’ll take you home,” he said. “I guess you’ve distinguished\nyourself enough for the day.”",
        "Arthur followed him, silent and meek as a humbled dog. As they were\ndriving along Schulze misread a mournful look which Arthur cast at his\nbandaged hand. “It’s nothing–nothing at all,” he said gruffly. “In a\nweek or less you could be back at work.” The accompanying sardonic grin\nsaid plain as print, “But this dainty dandy is done with work.”",
        "Weak and done though Arthur was, some blood came into his pale face and\nhe bit his lip with anger.",
        "Schulze saw these signs.",
        "“Several men are killed every year in those works–and not through\ntheir carelessness, either,” he went on in a milder, friendlier tone.\n\"And forty or fifty are maimed–not like that little pin scratch of\nyours, my dear Mr. Ranger, but hands lost, legs lost–accidents that make\ncripples for life. That means tragedy–not the wolf at the door, but with\nhis snout right in the platter.”",
        "“I’ve seen that,” said Arthur. “But I never thought much about\nit–until now.”",
        "“Naturally,” commented Schulze, with sarcasm. Then he added\nphilosophically, “And it’s just as well not to bother about it. Mankind\nfound this world a hell, and is trying to make it over into a heaven. And\na hell it still is, even more of a hell than at first, and it’ll be still\nmore of a hell–for these machines and these slave-driving capitalists\nwith their luxury-crazy families are worse than wars and aristocrats.\nThey make the men work, and the women and the children–make ’em all work\nas the Pharaohs never sweated the wretches they set at building the\npyramids. The nearer the structure gets toward completion, the worse the\ndriving and the madder the haste. Some day the world’ll be worth living\nin–probably just about the time it’s going to drop into the sun.\nMeanwhile, it’s a hell of a place. We’re a race of slaves, toiling for\nthe benefit of the race of gods that’ll some day be born into a habitable\nworld and live happily ever afterwards. Science will give them\nhappiness–and immortality, if they lose the taste for the adventure into\nthe Beyond.”",
        "Arthur’s brain heard clearly enough to remember afterwards; but Schulze’s\nvoice seemed to be coming through a thick wall. When they reached the\nRanger house, Schulze had to lift him from the buggy and support his\nweight and guide his staggering steps. Out ran Mrs. Ranger, with theterror in her eyes.",
        "“Don’t lose your head, ma’am,” said Schulze. “It’s only a cut finger. The\nyoung fool forgot he was steering a machine, and had a sharp but slight\nreminder.”",
        "Schulze was heavily down on the “interesting-invalid” habit. He held that\nthe world’s supply of sympathy was so small that there wasn’t enough to\nprovide encouragement for those working hard and well; that those who\nfell into the traps of illness set in folly by themselves should get, at\nmost, toleration in the misfortunes in which others were compelled to\nshare. “The world discourages strength and encourages weakness,” he used\nto declaim. “That injustice and cruelty must be reversed!”",
        "“Doctor Schulze is right,” Arthur was saying to his mother, with an\nattempt at a smile. But he was glad of the softness and ease of the big\ndivan in the back parlor, of the sense of hovering and protecting love he\ngot from his mother’s and Adelaide’s anxious faces. Sorer than the really\ntrifling wound was the deep cut into his vanity. How his fellow-workmen\nwere pitying him!–a poor blockhead of a bungler who had thus brought to\na pitiful climax his failure to learn a simple trade. And how the whole\ntown would talk and laugh! “Hiram Ranger, he begat a fool!”",
        "Schulze, with proper equipment, redressed and rebandaged the wound, and\nleft, after cautioning the young man not to move the sick arm. “You’ll\nbe all right to strum the guitar and sport a diamond ring in a fortnight\nat the outside,” said he. At the door he lectured Adelaide: “For God’s\nsake, Miss Ranger, don’t let his mother coddle him. He’s got the makings\nof a man like his father–not as big, perhaps, but still a lot of a man.\nGive him a chance! Give him a chance! If this had happened in a football\ngame or a fox-hunt, nobody would have thought anything of it. But just\nbecause it was done at useful work, you’ve got yourself all fixed to make\na fearful to-do.”",
        "How absurdly does practice limp along, far behind firm-striding theory!\nSchulze came twice that day, looked in twice the next day, and fussed\nlike a disturbed setting-hen when his patient forestalled the next day’s\nvisit by appearing at his office for treatment. “I want to see if I\ncan’t heal that cut without a scar,” was his explanation–but it was a\nmere excuse.",
        "When Arthur called on the fifth day, Schulze’s elder daughter, Madelene,\nopened the door. “Will you please tell the doctor,” said he, “that the\nworkman who cut his finger at the cooperage wishes to see him?”",
        "Madelene’s dark gray eyes twinkled. She was a tall and, so he thought,\nrather severe-looking young woman; her jet black hair was simply, yet not\nwithout a suspicion of coquetry, drawn back over her ears from a central\npart–or what would have been a part had her hair been less thick. She\nwas studying medicine under her father. It was the first time he had seen\nher, it so happened, since she was in knee dresses at public school. As\nhe looked he thought: “A splendid advertisement for the old man’s\nbusiness.” Just why she seemed so much healthier than even the\nhealthiest, he found it hard to understand. She was neither robust nor\nradiant. Perhaps it was the singular clearness of her dead-white skin and\nof the whites of her eyes; again it might have been the deep crimson of\nher lips and of the inside of her mouth–a wide mouth with two perfect\nrows of small, strong teeth of the kind that go with intense vitality.",
        "“Just wait here,” said she, in a businesslike tone, as she indicated the\nreception room.",
        "“You don’t remember me?” said Arthur, to detain her.",
        "“No, I don’t remember you,” replied Madelene. “But I know who you are.”",
        "“Who I was,” thought Arthur, his fall never far from the foreground of\nhis mind. “You used to be very serious, and always perfect in your\nlessons,” he continued aloud, “and–most superior.”",
        "Madelene laughed. “I was a silly little prig,” said she. Then, not\nwithout a subtle hint of sarcasm, “But I suppose we all go through that\nperiod–some of us in childhood, others further along.”",
        "Arthur smiled, with embarrassment. So he had the reputation of\nbeing a prig.",
        "Madelene was in the doorway. “Father will be free–presently,” said she.\n\"He has another patient with him. If you don’t care to wait, perhaps I\ncan look after the cut. Father said it was a trifle.”",
        "Arthur slipped his arm out of the sling.",
        "“In here,” said Madelene, opening the door of a small room to the left of\nher father’s consultation room.",
        "Arthur entered. “This is your office?” he asked, looking round curiously,\nadmiringly. It certainly was an interesting room, as the habitat of an\ninteresting personality is bound to be.",
        "“Yes,” she replied. “Sit here, please.”",
        "Arthur seated himself in the chair by the window and rested his arm on\nthe table. He thought he had never seen fingers so long as hers, or so\ngraceful. Evidently she had inherited from her father that sure, firm\ntouch which is perhaps the highest talent of the surgeon. “It seems such\nan–an–such a hard profession for a woman,” said he, to induce those\nfascinating lips of hers to move.",
        "“It isn’t soft,” she replied. “But then father hasn’t brought us up\nsoft.”",
        "This was discouraging, but Arthur tried again. “You like it?”",
        "“I love it,” said she, and now her eyes were a delight. “It makes me\nhate to go to bed at night, and eager to get up in the morning. And that\nmeans really living, doesn’t it?”",
        "“A man like me must seem to you a petty sort of creature.”",
        "“Oh, I haven’t any professional haughtiness,” was her laughing reply.\n\"One kind of work seems to me just as good as another. It’s the spirit of\nthe workman that makes the only differences.”",
        "“That’s it,” said Arthur, with a humility which he thought genuine and\nwhich was perhaps not wholly false. “I don’t seem to be able to give my\nheart to my work.”",
        "“I fancy you’ll give it attention hereafter,” suggested Madelene. She\nhad dressed the almost healed finger and was dexterously rebandaging it.\nShe was necessarily very near to him, and from her skin there seemed to\nissue a perfumed energy that stimulated his nerves. Their eyes met. Both\nsmiled and flushed.",
        "“That wasn’t very kind–that remark,” said he.",
        "“What’s all this?” broke in the sharp voice of the doctor.",
        "Arthur started guiltily, but Madelene, without lifting her eyes from her\ntask, answered: “Mr. Ranger didn’t want to be kept waiting.”",
        "“She’s trying to steal my practice away from me!” cried Schulze. He\nlooked utterly unlike his daughter at first glance, but on closer\ninspection there was an intimate resemblance, like that between the nut\nand its rough, needle-armored shell. “Well, I guess she hasn’t botched\nit.” This in a pleased voice, after an admiring inspection of the\nworkmanlike bandage. “Come again to-morrow, young man.”",
        "Arthur bowed to Madelene and somehow got out into the street. He was\nastonished at himself and at the world. He had gone drearily into that\noffice out of a dreary world; he had issued forth light of heart and\ndelighted with the fresh, smiling, interesting look of the shaded streets\nand the green hedges and lawns and flower beds. “A fine old town,” he\nsaid to himself. “Nice, friendly people–and the really right sort. As\nsoon as I’m done with the rough stretch I’ve got just ahead of me, I’m\ngoing to like it. Let me see–one of those girls was named Walpurga and\none was named–Madelene–this one, I’m sure–Yes!” And he could hear the\nteacher calling the roll, could hear the alto voice from the serious face\nanswer to “Madelene Schulze,” could hear the light voice from the face\nthat was always ready to burst into smiles answer to “Walpurga Schulze.”",
        "But though it was quite unnecessary he, with a quite unnecessary show of\ncarelessness, asked Del which was which. “The black one is Madelene,\"\nreplied she, and her ability to speak in such an indifferent tone of such\nan important person surprised him. “The blonde is Walpurga. I used to\ndetest Madelene. She always treated me as if I hadn’t any sense.”",
        "“Well, you can’t blame her for that, Del,” said Arthur. “You’ve been a\ngreat deal of a fool in your day–before you blossomed out. Do you\nremember the time Dory called you down for learning things to show off,\nand how furious you got?”",
        "Adelaide looked suddenly warm, though she laughed too. “Why did you ask\nabout Dr. Schulze’s daughters?” she asked.",
        "“I saw one of them this morning–a beauty, a tip-topper. And no nonsense\nabout her. As she’s ’black,’ I suppose her name is Madelene.”",
        "“Oh, I remember now!” exclaimed Adelaide. “Madelene is going to be a\ndoctor. They say she’s got nerves of iron–can cut and slash like\nher father.”",
        "Arthur was furious, just why he didn’t know. No doubt what Del said was\ntrue, but there were ways and ways of saying things. “I suppose there is\nsome sneering at her,” said he, “among the girls who couldn’t do\nanything if they tried. It seems to me, if there is any profession a\nwoman could follow without losing her womanliness, it is that of doctor.\nEvery woman ought to be a doctor, whether she ever tries to make a\nliving out of it or not.”",
        "Adelaide was not a little astonished by this outburst.",
        "“You’ll be coming round to Dory’s views of women, if you aren’t\ncareful,” said she.",
        "“There’s a lot of sense in what Dory says about a lot of things,\"\nreplied Arthur.",
        "Del sheered off. “How did the doctor say your hand is?”",
        "“Oh–all right,” said Arthur. “I’m going to work on Monday.”",
        "“Did he say you could?”",
        "“No, but I’m tired of doing nothing. I’ve got to ’get busy’ if I’m to\npull out of this mess.”",
        "His look, his tone made his words sound revolutionary. And, in fact, his\nmood was revolutionary. He was puzzled at his own change of attitude. His\nsky had cleared of black clouds; the air was no longer heavy and\noppressive. He wanted to work; he felt that by working he could\naccomplish something, could deserve and win the approval of people who\nwere worthwhile–people like Madelene Schulze, for instance.",
        "Next day he lurked round the corner below the doctor’s house until he saw\nhim drive away; then he went up and rang the bell. This time it was the\n\"blonde” that answered–small and sweet, pink and white, with tawny hair.\nThis was disconcerting. “I couldn’t get here earlier,” he explained. “I\nsaw the doctor just driving away. But, as these bandages feel\nuncomfortable, I thought perhaps his daughter–your sister, is she\nnot?–might–might fix them.”",
        "Walpurga looked doubtful. “I think she’s busy,” she said. “I don’t like\nto disturb her.”",
        "Just then Madelene crossed the hall. Her masses of black hair were rolled\ninto a huge knot on top of her head; she was wearing a white work slip\nand her arms were bare to the elbows–the finest arms he had ever seen,\nArthur thought. She seemed in a hurry and her face was flushed–she would\nhave looked no differently if she had heard his voice and had come forth\nto prevent his getting away without having seen him. “Meg!” called her\nsister. “Can you–”",
        "Madelene apparently saw her sister and Arthur for the first time. “Good\nmorning, Mr. Ranger. You’ve come too late. Father’s out.”",
        "Arthur repeated his doleful tale, convincingly now, for his hand did feel\nqueer–as what hand would not, remembering such a touch as Madelene’s,\nand longing to experience it again?",
        "“Certainly,” said Madelene. “I’ll do the best I can. Come in.”",
        "And once more he was in her office, with her bending over him. And\npresently her hair came unrolled, came showering down on his arm, on his\nface; and he shook like a leaf and felt as if he were going to faint,\ninto such an ecstasy did the soft rain of these tresses throw him. As\nfor Madelene, she was almost hysterical in her confusion. She darted\nfrom the room.",
        "When she returned she seemed calm, but that was because she did not lift\nthose tell-tale gray eyes. Neither spoke as she finished her work. If\nArthur had opened his lips it would have been to say words which he\nthought she would resent, and he repent. Not until his last chance had\nalmost ebbed did he get himself sufficiently in hand to speak. “It wasn’t\ntrue–what I said,” he began. “I waited until your father was gone. Then\nI came–to see you. As you probably know, I’m only a workman, hardly even\nthat, at the cooperage, but–I want to come to see you. May I?”",
        "She hesitated.",
        "“I know the people in this town have a very poor opinion of me,” he went\non, “and I deserve it, no doubt. You see, the bottom dropped out of my\nlife not long ago, and I haven’t found myself yet. But you did more for\nme in ten minutes the other day than everything and everybody, including\nmyself, have been able to do since my father died.”",
        "“I don’t remember that I said anything,” she murmured.",
        "“I didn’t say that what you said helped me. I said what you did–and\nlooked. And–I’d like to come.”",
        "“We never have any callers,” she explained. “You see,\nfather’s–our–views–People don’t understand us. And, too, we’ve found\nourselves very congenial and sufficient unto one another. So–I–I–don’t\nknow what to say.”",
        "He looked so cast down that she hastened on: “Yes–come whenever you\nlike. We’re always at home. But we work all day.”",
        "“So do I,” said Arthur. “Thank you. I’ll come–some evening next week.”",
        "Suddenly he felt peculiarly at ease with her, as if he had always known\nher, as if she and he understood each other perfectly. “I’m afraid you’ll\nfind me stupid,” he went on. “I don’t know much about any of the things\nyou’re interested in.”",
        "“Perhaps I’m interested in more things than you imagine,” said she. “My\nsister says I’m a fraud–that I really have a frivolous mind and that my\nserious look is a hollow pretense.”",
        "And so they talked on, not getting better acquainted but enjoying the\nrealization of how extremely well acquainted they were. When he was gone,\nMadelene found that her father had been in for some time. “Didn’t he ask\nfor me?” she said to Walpurga.",
        "“Yes,” answered Walpurga. “And I told him you were flirting with\nArthur Ranger.”",
        "Madelene colored violently. “I never heard that word in this house\nbefore,” she said stiffly.",
        "“Nor I,” replied Walpurga, the pink and white. “And I think it’s high\ntime–with you nearly twenty-two and me nearly twenty.”",
        "At dinner her father said: “Well, Lena, so you’ve got a beau at last. I’d\ngiven up hope.”",
        "“For Heaven’s sake don’t scare him away, father!” cried Walpurga.",
        "“A pretty poor excuse,” pursued the doctor. “I doubt if Arthur Ranger can\nmake enough to pay his own board in a River Street lodging house.”",
        "“It took courage–real courage–to go to work as he did,” replied\nMadelene, her color high.",
        "“Yes,” admitted her father, ’if he sticks to it.”",
        "“He will stick to it,” affirmed Madelene.",
        "“I think so,” assented her father, dropping his teasing pretense and\ncoming out frankly for Arthur. “When a man shows that he has the courage\nto cross the Rubicon, there’s no need to worry about whether he’ll go on\nor turn back.”",
        "“You mustn’t let him know he’s the only beau you’ve ever had, Meg,\"\ncautioned her sister.",
        "“And why not?” demanded Madelene. “If I ever did care especially for a\nman, I’d not care for him because other women had. And I shouldn’t want a\nman to be so weak and vain as to feel that way about me.”",
        "It was a temptation to that aloof and isolated, yet anything but lonely\nor lonesome, household to discuss this new and strange phenomenon–the\nintrusion of an outsider, and he a young man. But the earnestness in\nMadelene’s voice made her father and her sister feel that to tease her\nfurther would be impertinent.",
        "Arthur had said he would not call until the next week because then he\nwould be at work again. He went once more to Dr. Schulze’s, but was\ncareful to go in office hours. He did not see Madelene–though she,\nbehind the white sash curtains of her own office, saw him come, watched\nhim go until he was out of sight far down the street. On Monday he went\nto work, really to work. No more shame; no more shirking or shrinking; no\nmore lingering on the irrevocable. He squarely faced the future, and,\nwith his will like his father’s, set dogged and unconquerable energy to\nbattering at the obstacles before him. “All a man needs,” said he to\nhimself, at the end of the first day of real work, “is a purpose. He\nnever knows where he’s at until he gets one. And once he gets it, he\ncan’t rest till he has accomplished it.”",
        "What was his purpose? He didn’t know–beyond a feeling that he must\nlift himself from his present position of being an object of pity to\nall Saint X and the sort of man that hasn’t the right to ask any woman\nto be his wife.",
        "A large sum would soon be available; so the carrying out of the plans to\nextend, or, rather, to construct Tecumseh, must be begun. The trustees\ncommissioned young Hargrave to go abroad at once in search of educational\nand architectural ideas, and to get apparatus that would make the\nlaboratories the best in America. Chemistry and its most closely related\nsciences were to be the foundation of the new university, as they are at\nthe foundation of life. “We’ll model our school, not upon what the\nignorant wise of the Middle Ages thought ought to be life, but upon life\nitself,” said Dr. Hargrave. “We’ll build not from the clouds down, but\nfrom the ground up.” He knew in the broad outline what was wanted for the\nTecumseh of his dream; but he felt that he was too old, perhaps too\nrusted in old-fashioned ways and ideas, himself to realize the dream; so\nhe put the whole practical task upon Dory, whom he had trained from\ninfancy to just that end.",
        "When it was settled that Dory was to go, would be away a year at the\nleast, perhaps two years, he explained to Adelaide. “They expect me to\nleave within a fortnight,” he ended. And she knew what was in his\nmind–what he was hoping she would say.",
        "It so happened that, in the months since their engagement, an immense\namount of work had been thrust upon Dory. Part of it was a study of the\ngreat American universities, and that meant long absences from home. All\nof it was of the kind that must be done at once or not at all–and Work\nis the one mistress who, if she be enamored enough of a man to resolve\nto have him and no other, can compel him, whether he be enamored of her\nor not. However, for the beginning of the artificial relation between\nthis engaged couple, the chief cause was not his work but his attitude\ntoward her, his not unnatural but highly unwise regard for the peculiar\ncircumstances in which they had become engaged. Respect for the real\nfeelings of others is all very well, if not carried too far; but respect\nfor the purely imaginary feelings of others simply encourages them to\nplunge deeper into the fogs and bogs of folly. There was excuse for\nDory’s withholding from his love affair the strong and firm hand he laid\nupon all his other affairs; but it cannot be denied that he deserved what\nhe got, or, rather, that he failed to deserve what he did not get. And\nthe irony of it was that his unselfishness was chiefly to blame; for a\nselfish man would have gone straight at Del and, with Dory’s advantages,\nwould have captured her forthwith.",
        "As it was, she drifted aimlessly through day after day, keeping close at\nhome, interested in nothing. She answered briefly or not at all the\nletters from her old friends, and she noted with a certain blunted\nbitterness how their importunities fainted and died away, as the news of\nthe change in her fortunes got round. If she had been seeing them face to\nface every day, or if she had been persistent and tenacious, they would\nhave extricated themselves less abruptly; for not the least important\namong the sacred “appearances” of conventionality is the “appearance” of\ngood-heartedness; it is the graceful cloak for that icy selfishness which\nis as inevitable among the sheltered and pampered as sympathy and\nhelpfulness are among those naked to the joys and sorrows of real life.\nAdelaide was far from her friends, and she deliberately gave them every\nopportunity to abandon and to forget her without qualms or fears of\n\"appearing” mean and snobbish. There were two girls from whom she rather\nhoped for signs of real friendship. She had sought them in the first\nplace because they were “of the right sort,” but she had come to like\nthem for themselves and she believed they liked her for herself. And so\nthey did; but their time was filled with the relentless routine of the\nfashionable life, and they had not a moment to spare for their own\npersonal lives; besides, Adelaide wouldn’t have “fitted in” comfortably.\nThe men of their set would be shy of her now; the women would regard her\nas a waste of time.",
        "Her beauty and her cleverness might have saved her, had she been of one\nof those “good families” whom fashionables the world over recognize,\nregardless of their wealth or poverty, because recognition of them gives\nan elegant plausibility to the pretense that Mammon is not the supreme\ngod in the Olympus of aristocracy. But–who were the Rangers? They might\nbe “all right” in Saint X, but where was Saint X? Certainly, not on any\nmap in the geography of fashion.",
        "So Adelaide, sore but too lethargic to suffer, drifted drearily along,\nfeeling that if Dory Hargrave were not under the influence of that\nbrilliant, vanished past of hers, even he would abandon her as had the\nrest, or, at least, wouldn’t care for her. Not that she doubted his\nsincerity in the ideals he professed; but people deceived themselves so\ncompletely. There was her own case; had she for an instant suspected how\nflimsily based was her own idea of herself and of her place in the\nworld?–the “world” meaning, of course, “the set.” As is the rule in\n\"sets,” her self-esteem’s sole foundation had been what she had, or,\nrather, what the family had, and now that that was gone, she held what\nwas left cheap indeed–and held herself the cheaper that she could feel\nthus. At the outset, Arthur, after the familiar male fashion, was\napparently the weaker of the two. But when the test came, when the time\nfor courageous words was succeeded by the time for deeds, the shrinking\nfrom action that, since the nation grew rich, has become part of the\neducation of the women of the classes which shelter and coddle their\nwomen, caused Adelaide to seem feeble indeed beside her brother.\nAlso–and this should never be forgotten in judging such a woman–Arthur\nhad the advantage of the man’s compulsion to act, while Adelaide had the\ndisadvantage of being under no material necessity to act–and what\nnecessity but the material is there?",
        "Dory–his love misleading his passion, as it usually does when it has\nmuch influence before marriage–reasoned that, in the interest of the\nAdelaide that was to be, after they were married, and in his own interest\nwith her as well, the wise course for him to pursue was to wait until\ntime and the compulsion of new circumstances should drive away her mood,\nshould give her mind and her real character a chance to assert\nthemselves. In the commission to go abroad, he saw the external force for\nwhich he had been waiting and hoping. And it seemed to him most\ntimely–for Ross’s wedding invitations were out.",
        "“Two weeks,” said Adelaide absently. “You will sail in two weeks.” Then\nin two weeks she could be out of it all, could be far away in new\nsurroundings, among new ideas, among strangers. She could make the new\nstart; she could submerge, drown her old self in the new interests.",
        "“Will you come?” he said, when he could endure the suspense no longer.\n\"Won’t you come?”",
        "She temporized. “I’m afraid I couldn’t–oughtn’t to leave–mother and\nArthur just now.”",
        "He smiled sadly. She might need her mother and her brother; but in the\nmood in which she had been for the last few months, they certainly did\nnot need her. “Adelaide,” said he, with that firmness which he knew so\nwell how to combine with gentleness, without weakening it, “our whole\nfuture depends on this. If our lives are to grow together, we must begin.\nThis is our opportunity.”",
        "She knew that Dory was not a man she could play fast and loose with, even\nhad she been so disposed. Clearly, she must decide whether she intended\nto marry him, to make his life hers and her life his. She looked\nhelplessly round. What but him was there to build on? Without him–She\nbroke the long silence with, “That is true. We must begin.” Then, after a\npause during which she tried to think and found she couldn’t, “Make up my\nmind for me.”",
        "“Let us be married day after to-morrow,” said he. “We can leave for New\nYork on the one o’clock train and sail on Thursday.”",
        "“You had it planned!”",
        "“I had several plans,” he answered. “That’s the best one.”",
        "What should she do? Impulsively–why, she did not know–she gave Dory her\nanswer: “Yes, that is the best plan. I must begin–at once.” And she\nstarted up, in a fever to be doing.",
        "Dory, dazed by his unexpected, complete victory, went immediately, lest\nhe should say or do something that would break or weaken the current of\nher aroused energy. He went without as much as touching her hand.\nCertainly, if ever man tempted fate to snatch from him the woman he\nloved, Dory did then; and at that time Del must, indeed, have been\nstrongly drawn to him, or she would have been unable to persist.",
        "The problem of the trousseau was almost as simple for her as for him. She\nhad been extravagant and luxurious, had accumulated really unmanageable\nquantities of clothing of all kinds, far, far more than any woman without\na maid could take care of. The fact that she had not had a maid was in\npart responsible for this superfluity. She had neither the time nor the\npatience for making or for directing the thousand exasperating little\nrepairs that are necessary if a woman with a small wardrobe is always to\nlook well. So, whenever repairs were necessary, she bought instead; and\nas she always kept herself fresh and perfect to the smallest detail she\nhad to buy profusely. As soon as a dress or a hat or a blouse or a\nparasol, a pair of boots, slippers, stockings, or any of the costly,\nflimsy, all but unlaunderable underwear she affected, became not quite\nperfect, she put it aside against that vague day when she should have\nleisure or inclination for superintending a seamstress. Within two hours\nof her decision she had a seamstress in the house, and they and her\nmother were at work. There was no necessity to bother about new dresses.\nShe would soon be putting off black, and she could get in Paris what she\nwould then need.",
        "In the whirlwind of those thirty-six hours, she had not a moment to think\nof anything but the material side of the wedding–the preparations for\nthe journey and for the long absence. She was half an hour late in\ngetting down to the front parlor for the ceremony, and she looked so\ntired from toil and lack of sleep that Dory in his anxiety about her was\nall but unconscious that they were going through the supposedly solemn\nmarriage rite. Looking back on it afterwards, they could remember little\nabout it–perhaps even less than can the average couple, under our social\nsystem which makes a wedding a social function, not a personal rite. They\nhad once in jesting earnest agreed that they would have the word “obey\"\nleft out of the vows; but they forgot this, and neither was conscious of\nrepeating “obey” after the preacher. Adelaide was thinking of her trunks,\nwas trying to recall the things she felt she must have neglected in the\nrush; Dory was worrying over her paleness and the heavy circles under her\neyes, was fretting about the train–Del’s tardiness had not been in the\ncalculations. Even the preacher, infected by the atmosphere of haste, ran\nover the sentences, hardly waiting for the responses. Adelaide’s mother\nwas hearing the trunks going down to the van, and was impatient to be\nwhere she could superintend–there was a very important small trunk, full\nof underclothes, which she was sure they were overlooking. Arthur was\ngloomily abstracted, was in fierce combat with the bitter and melancholy\nthoughts which arose from the contrast he could not but make–this simple\nwedding, with Dory Hargrave as her groom, when in other circumstances\nthere would have been such pomp and grandeur. He and Mary the cook and\nEllen the upstairs girl and old Miss Skeffington, generalissimo of the\nHargrave household, were the only persons present keenly conscious that\nthere was in progress a wedding, a supposedly irrevocable union of a man\nand woman for life and for death and for posterity. Even old Dr. Hargrave\nwas thinking of what Dory was to do on the other side, was mentally\ngoing over the elaborate scheme for his son’s guidance which he had drawn\nup and committed to paper. Judge Torrey, the only outsider, was putting\ninto form the speech he intended to make at the wedding breakfast.",
        "But there was no wedding breakfast–at least, none for bride and groom.\nThe instant the ceremony was over, Mary the cook whispered to Mrs.\nRanger: “Mike says they’ve just got time to miss the train.”",
        "“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Ranger. And she darted out to halt the van\nand count the trunks. Then she rushed in and was at Adelaide’s arm.\n\"Hurry, child!” she exclaimed. “Here is my present for you.”",
        "And she thrust into her hand a small black leather case, the cover of a\nletter of credit. Seeing that Del was too dazed to realize what was going\non, she snatched it away and put it into the traveling case which Mary\nwas carrying. Amid much shaking hands and kissing and nervous crying,\namid flooding commonplaces and hysterical repetitions of “Good-by! Good\nluck!” the young people were got off. There was no time for Mary to bring\nthe rice from the kitchen table, but Ellen had sequestered one of\nAdelaide’s old dancing slippers under the front stair. She contrived to\nget it out and into action, and to land it full in Adelaide’s lap by a\nlucky carom against the upright of the coach window.",
        "Adelaide looked down at it vaguely. It was one of a pair of slippers she\nhad got for the biggest and most fashionable ball she had ever attended.\nShe remembered it all–the gorgeousness of the rooms, the flowers, the\ndresses, the favors, her own ecstasy in being where it was supposed to be\nso difficult to get; how her happiness had been marred in the early part\nof the evening by Ross’s attendance on Helen Galloway in whose honor the\nball was given; how he made her happy again by staying beside her the\nwhole latter part of the evening, he and more young men than any other\ngirl had. And here was the slipper, with its handsome buckle torn off,\nstained, out of shape from having been so long cast aside. Where did it\ncome from? How did it get here? Why had this ghost suddenly appeared to\nher? On the opposite seat, beside her traveling case, fashionable,\nobviously expensive, with her initials in gold, was a bag marked\n\"T.H.\"–of an unfashionable appearance, obviously inexpensive, painfully\nnew. She could not take her fascinated eyes from it; and the hammering of\nher blood upon her brain, as the carriage flew toward the station, seemed\nto be a voice monotonously repeating, “Married–married–” She shuddered.\n\"My fate is settled for life,” she said to herself. “I am married!”",
        "She dared not look at her husband–Husband! In that moment of cruel\nmemory, of ghastly chopfallen vanity, it was all she could do not visibly\nto shrink from him. She forgot that he was her best friend, her friend\nfrom babyhood almost, Theodore Hargrave. She felt only that he was her\nhusband, her jailer, the representative of all that divided her forever\nfrom the life of luxury and show which had so permeated her young blood\nwith its sweet, lingering poison. She descended from the carriage, passed\nthe crowd of gaping, grinning loungers, and entered the train, with\ncheeks burning and eyes downcast, an ideal bride in appearance of shy and\nrefined modesty. And none who saw her delicate, aristocratic beauty of\nface and figure and dress could have attributed to her the angry, ugly,\nsnobbish thoughts, like a black core hidden deep in the heart of a\nbewitching flower.",
        "As he sat opposite her in the compartment, she was exaggerating into\nglaring faults the many little signs of indifference to fashion in his\ndress. She had never especially noted before, but now she was noting as\na shuddering exhibition of “commonness,” that he wore detachable\ncuffs–and upon this detail her distraught mind fixed as typical. She\ncould not take her eyes off his wrists; every time he moved his arms so\nthat she could see the wristband within his cuff, she felt as if a piece\nof sandpaper were scraping her skin. He laid his hand on her two gloved\nhands, folded loosely in her lap. Every muscle, every nerve of her body\ngrew tense; she only just fought down the impulse to snatch her hands\naway and shriek at him.",
        "She sat rigid, her teeth set, her eyes closed, until her real self got\nsome control over the monstrous, crazy creature raving within her. Then\nshe said: “Please don’t–touch me–just now. I’ve been on such a\nstrain–and I’m almost breaking down.”",
        "He drew his hand away. “I ought to have understood,” he said. “Would you\nlike to be left alone for a while?”",
        "Without waiting for her answer, he left the compartment to her. She\nlocked the door and let herself loose. When she had had her cry “out,\"\nshe felt calm; but oh, so utterly depressed. “This is only a mood,” she\nsaid to herself. “I don’t really feel that way toward him. Still–I’ve\nmade a miserable mistake. I ought not to have married him. I must hide\nit. I mustn’t make him suffer for what’s altogether my own fault. I must\nmake the best of it.”",
        "When he came back, she proceeded to put her programme into action. All\nthe afternoon he strove with her sweet gentleness and exaggerated\nconsideration for him; he tried to make her see that there was no\nnecessity for this elaborate pose and pretense. But she was too absorbed\nin her part to heed him. In the evening, soon after they returned to the\ncompartment from the dining car, he rose. “I am going out to smoke,” he\nsaid. “I’ll tell the porter to make up your berth. You must be very\ntired. I have taken another–out in the car–so that you will not be\ndisturbed.”",
        "She grew white, and a timid, terrified look came into her eyes.",
        "He touched her shoulder–gently. “Don’t–please!” he said quietly. “In\nall the years we’ve known each other, have you ever seen anything in me\nto make you feel–like–that?”",
        "Her head drooped still lower, and her face became crimson.",
        "“Adelaide, look at me!”",
        "She lifted her eyes until they met his uncertainly.",
        "He put out his hand. “We are friends, aren’t we?”",
        "She instantly laid her hand in his.",
        "“Friends,” he repeated. “Let us hold fast to that–and let the rest take\ncare of itself.”",
        "“I’m ashamed of myself,” said she. And in her swift revulsion of\nfeeling there was again opportunity for him. But he was not in the mood\nto see it.",
        "“You certainly ought to be,” replied he, with his frank smile that was so\nfull of the suggestions of health and sanity and good humor. “You’ll\nnever get a martyr’s crown at my expense.”",
        "At New York he rearranged their steamer accommodations. It was no longer\ndiffidence and misplaced consideration that moved him permanently to\nestablish the most difficult of barriers between them; it was pride now,\nfor in her first stormy, moments in the train he had seen farther into\nher thoughts than he dared let himself realize.",
        "The day after the wedding, as Arthur was going home from work, he saw\nRoss on the lofty seat of a dogcart, driving toward him along lower\nMonroe Street. His anger instantly flamed and flared; he crushed an oath\nbetween his teeth and glanced about for some way to avoid the humiliating\nmeeting. But there was no cross street between him and the on-coming\ncart. Pride, or vanity, came to his support, as soon as he was convinced\nthat escape was impossible. With an air that was too near to defiance to\ncreate the intended impression of indifference, he swung along and, just\nas the cart was passing, glanced at his high-enthroned former friend.",
        "Ross had not seen him until their eyes met. He drew his horse in so\nsharply that it reared and pawed in amazement and indignation at the\nbit’s coarse insult to thoroughbred instincts for courteous treatment. He\nknew Arthur was at work in the factory; but he did not expect to see him\nin workman’s dress, with a dinner pail in his hand. And from his height,\nhe, clad in the carefully careless, ostentatiously unostentatious\ngarments of the “perfect gentleman,” gazed speechless at the spectacle.\nArthur reddened violently. Not all the daily contrasts thrust upon him in\nthose months at the cooperage had so brought home to his soul the\ndifferences of caste. And there came to him for the first time that\nhatred of inequalities which, repulsive though it is in theory, is yet\nthe true nerver of the strong right arm of progress. It is as\ncharacteristic of the homely, human countenance of Democracy as the\nsupercilious smirk is of the homely, inhuman countenance of caste.\nArthur did not want to get up where Ross was seated in such elegant\nstate; he wanted to tear Ross, all the Rosses down. “The damn fool!” he\nfumed. “He goes lounging about, wasting the money we make. It’s all\nwrong. And if we weren’t a herd of tame asses, we wouldn’t permit it.”",
        "And now he began to feel that he was the superior of this showy idler,\nthat his own garments and dinner pail and used hands were the titles to a\nnobility which could justly look down upon those who filched from the\ntreasury of the toiler the means to buzz and flit and glitter in\ndronelike ease. “As for these Whitneys,” he thought, “mother’s right\nabout them.” Then he called out in a tone of good-natured contempt, which\nhis stature and his powerful frame and strong, handsome face made\neffective: “Hello, Ross! When did you come to town?”",
        "“This morning,” replied Ross. “I heard you were working, but I had no\nidea it was–I’ve just been to your house, looking for you, and was on\nthe way to the factory. Father told me to see that you get a suitable\nposition. I’m going to Howells and arrange it. You know, father’s been in\nthe East and very busy.”",
        "“Don’t bother,” said Arthur, and there was no pretense in his air of\nease. “I’ve got just what I want. I am carrying out father’s plan, and\nI’m far enough into it to see that he was right.”",
        "In unbelieving silence Ross looked down at his former equal with\ncondescending sympathy; how well Arthur knew that look! And he remembered\nthat he had once, so short a time before, regarded it as kindly, and the\nthoughts behind it as generous!",
        "“I like my job,” he continued. “It gives me a sense of doing something\nuseful–of getting valuable education. Already I’ve had a thousand\ndamn-fool ideas knocked out of my head.”",
        "“I suppose it is interesting,” said Ross, with gracious encouragement.\n\"The associations must be rather trying.”",
        "“They were rather trying,” replied Arthur with a smile. “Trying to the\nother men, until I got my bearings and lost the silliest of the silly\nideas put in my head by college and that sort of thing. But, now that I\nrealize I’m an apprentice and not a gentleman deigning to associate with\nthe common herd, I think I’m less despicable–and less ridiculous. Still,\nI’m finding it hard to get it through my head that practically everything\nI learned is false and must be unlearned.”",
        "“Don’t let your bitterness over the injustice to you swing you too far\nthe other way, Artie,” said Ross with a faint smile in his eyes and a\nsuspicious, irritating friendliness in his voice. “You’ll soon work out\nof that class and back where you belong.”",
        "Arthur was both angry and amused. No doubt Ross was right as to the\norigin of this new breadth of his; but a wrong motive may start a man\nright just as readily as a right motive may start him wrong. Arthur would\nhave admitted frankly his first feelings about his changed position,\nwould have admitted that those feelings still lingered, still seemed to\ninfluence him, as grown people often catch themselves thinking in terms\nof beliefs impressed on them in childhood, but exploded and abandoned at\nthe very threshold of youth. But he knew, also, that his present beliefs\nand resolves and aspirations were sincere, were sane, were final–the\nexpression of the mind and heart that were really himself. Of what use,\nhowever, to argue with Ross? “I could no more convince him,” thought\nArthur, “than I could myself have been convinced less than a year ago.\"\nBesides, of what importance were Ross’s beliefs about him or about his\nviews? So he said to him, and his tone and manner were now convincing:\n\"Well, we’ll see. However, as long as I’m a workman, I’ll stand with my\nclass–just as you stand with your class. And while you are pretending to\nbe generous to us, we’ll pretend to be contemptuous of you. You’ll think\nwe are living off of your money; we’ll think you are living off of our\nwork. You’ll say we’re earning less than half what we get; we’ll say\nyou’re stealing more than half what you get. It may amuse you to hear\nthat I am one of the organizers of the trades union that’s starting. I’m\non the committee on wages. So some day you and I are likely to meet.”",
        "“I don’t know much about those things,” said Ross politely. “I can\nsee that you’re right to ingratiate yourself with those working\nchaps. It will stand you in good stead when you get on top and have\nto manage them.”",
        "Arthur laughed, and so did Ross. They eyed each the other with covert\nhostility. “Poor creature!” thought Ross. And “Pup!” thought Arthur. “How\ncould I have wanted Del to marry him?” He wished to pass on, but was\ndetained by some suggestion in Ross’s manner that he had not yet\ndischarged his mind of its real burden.",
        "“I was glad to see your mother so well,” said Ross.",
        "“I wish she were,” replied Arthur. “She seemed to be better while the\nexcitement about Del’s wedding was on; but as soon as Del and Dory went,\nshe dropped back again. I think the only thing that keeps her from–from\njoining father is the feeling that, if she were to go, the family income\nwould stop. I feel sure we’d not have her, if father had left us well\nprovided for, as they call it.”",
        "“That is true,” said Ross, the decent side of his nature now full to the\nfore. “I can’t tell you what a sense of loss I had when your father died.\nArtie, he was a splendid gentleman. And there is a quality in your mother\nthat makes me feel very humble indeed before her.”",
        "Arthur passed, though he noted, the unconscious superciliousness in this\ntribute; he felt that it was a genuine tribute, that, for all its\ndiscoloration in its passage through the tainted outer part of Ross’s\nnature, it had come from the unspoiled, untainted, deepest part.\nFortunately for us all, the gold in human nature remains gold, whatever\nits alloys from base contacts; and it is worth the mining, though there\nbe but a grain of it to the ton of dross. As Ross spoke Arthur warmed to\nhim. “You must come to see us,” he said cordially.",
        "Ross became embarrassed, so embarrassed that all his ability to command\nhis feelings went for nothing. “Thank you,” said he hurriedly, “but I’m\nhere only for a few hours. I go away to-night. I came about a matter\nthat–that–I want to get back as soon as possible.”",
        "Arthur was mystified by the complete transformation of the\nself-complacent, superior Ross of a few minutes before. He now noted that\nRoss was looking almost ill, his eyes sunken, the lids red at the edges,\nas if from loss of sleep. Under Arthur’s scrutiny his embarrassment\nincreased to panic. He nervously shifted the reins, made the horse\nrestless, shook hands with Arthur, reined in, tried to speak, said only,\n\"I must be off–my horse is getting nervous,” and was gone.",
        "Arthur looked after him. “That’s the sort of chap I was on the way to\nbeing when father pulled me up,” he reflected. “I wonder if I’ll ever get\nsense enough not to have a sneaking envy of him–and regret?”",
        "If he could have looked in upon Ross’s mind, he might have been abruptly\nthrust far along the toilsome road toward his goal. In this world, roses\nand thorns have a startling, preposterous way of suddenly exchanging\nnatures so that what was thorn becomes fairest rose, and what was rose\nbecomes most poisonous of thorns. Ross had just fallen an amazed and\nincredulous victim to this alchemy. Though somewhat uncomfortable and\ndownright unhappy at times, he had been, on the whole, well pleased with\nhimself and his prospects until he heard that Adelaide was actually about\nto marry Dory. His content collapsed with the foundation on which it was\nbuilt–the feeling that Adelaide was for no other man, that if at any\ntime he should change his mind he would find her waiting to welcome him\ngratefully. He took train for Saint X, telling himself that after he got\nthere he could decide what to do. In fact, when he had heard that the\nwedding was about to be, it was over and Adelaide and Dory were off for\nNew York and Europe; but he did not find this out until he reached Saint\nX. The man who gave him that final and overwhelming news noticed no\nchange in his face, though looking for signs of emotion; nor did Ross\nleave him until he had confirmed the impression of a heart at ease. Far\nalong the path between the Country Club and Point Helen he struck into\nthe woods and, with only the birds and the squirrels as witnesses, gave\nway to his feelings.",
        "Now, now that she was irrevocably gone, he knew. He had made a hideous\nmistake; he had been led on by his vanity, led on and on until the trap\nwas closed and sprung; and it was too late. He sat there on a fallen tree\nwith his head aching as if about to explode, with eyes, dry and burning\nand a great horror of heart-hunger sitting before him and staring at him.\nIn their sufferings from defeated desire the selfish expiate their sins.",
        "He had forgotten his engagement to Theresa Howland, the wedding only\ntwo weeks away. It suddenly burst in upon his despair like a shout\nof derisive laughter. “I’ll not marry her!” he cried aloud. “I\ncan’t do it!”",
        "But even as he spoke he knew that he could, and would, and must. He had\nbeen a miserable excuse for a lover to Theresa; but Theresa had never had\nlove. All the men who had approached her with “intentions” had been\nfighting hard against their own contempt of themselves for seeking a wife\nfor the sake of her money, and their efforts at love-making had been tame\nand lame; but Theresa, knowing no better, simply thought men not up to\nthe expectations falsely raised by the romances and the songs. She\nbelieved she could not but get as good a quality of love as there was\ngoing; and Ross, with his delightful, aristocratic indifference, was\nperfectly satisfactory. Theresa had that thrice-armored self-complacence\nwhich nature so often relentingly gives, to more than supply the lack of\nthe charms withheld. She thought she was fascinating beyond any woman of\nher acquaintance, indeed, of her time. She spent hours in admiring\nherself, in studying out poses for her head and body and arms, especially\nher arms, which she regarded as nature’s last word on that kind of\nbeauty–a not wholly fanciful notion, as they were not bad, if a bit too\nshort between elbow and wrist, and rather fat at the shoulders. She\nalways thought and, on several occasions in bursts of confidence, had\nimparted to girl friends that “no man who has once cared for me can ever\ncare for another woman.” Several of her confidantes had precisely the\nsame modest opinion of their own powers; but they laughed at\nTheresa–behind her back.",
        "Ross knew how vain she was. To break with her, he would have to tell her\nflatly that he would not marry her. “I’d be doing her no injury,” thought\nhe. “Her vanity would root out some explanation which would satisfy her\nthat, whatever might be the cause, it wasn’t lack of love for her on my\npart.” But–To break off was unthinkable. The invitations out; the\narrangements for the wedding all made; quantities of presents\narrived–\"I’ve got to go through with it. I’ve got to marry her,” said\nRoss. “But God help me, how I shall hate her!”",
        "And, stripped clean of the glamour of her wealth, she rose before\nhim–her nose that was red and queer in the mornings; her little personal\nhabits that got on the nerves, especially a covert self-infatuated smile\nthat flitted over her face at any compliment, however obviously\nperfunctory; her way of talking about every trivial thing she did–and\nwhat did she do that was not trivial?–as if some diarist ought to take\nit down for the delight of ages to come. As Ross looked at the\nnew-created realistic image of her, he was amazed. “Why, I’ve always\ndisliked her!” he cried. “I’ve been lying to myself. I am too low for\nwords,” he groaned. “Was there ever such a sneaking cur?” Yes, many a\none, full as unconscious of his own qualities as he himself had been\nuntil that moment; nor could he find consolation in the fact that he had\ncompany, plenty of company, and it of the world’s most “gentlemanly” and\nmost “ladylike.”",
        "The young man who left that wood, the young man whom Arthur saw that day,\nhad in his heart a consciousness, an ache, of lonely poverty that dress\nand dogcarts and social position could do little–something, but\nlittle–to ease.",
        "He stopped at Chicago and sent word to Windrift that he was ill–not\nseriously ill, but in such a state that he thought it best to take care\nof himself, with the wedding so near. Theresa was just as well pleased\nto have him away, as it gave her absolute freedom to plan and to\nsuperintend her triumph. For the wedding was to be her individual and\nexclusive triumph, with even Ross as part of the background–the most\nconspicuous part, but still simply background for her personal splendor.",
        "Old Howland–called Bill until his early career as a pedlar and keeper of\na Cheap Jack bazaar was forgotten and who, after the great fire, which\nwiped out so many pasts and purified and pedigreed Chicago’s present\naristocracy, called himself William G. Howland, merchant prince, had, in\nhis ideal character for a wealth-chaser, one weakness–a doting fondness\nfor his daughter. When she came into the world, the doctors told him his\nwife would have no more children; thereafter his manner was always\ninsulting, and usually his tone and words, whenever and of whatever he\nspoke to her. Women were made by the Almighty solely to bear children to\nmen; his woman had been made to bear him a son. Now that she would never\nhave a son, she was of no use, and it galled him that he could find no\nplausibly respectable excuse for casting her off, as he cast off worn-out\nservants in his business. But as the years passed and he saw the various\nvarieties of thorns into which the sons of so many of his fellow-princes\ndeveloped, he became reconciled to Theresa–not to his wife. That\nunfortunate woman, the daughter of a drunkard and partially deranged by\nillness and by grief over her husband’s brutality toward her, became–or\nrather, was made by her insistent doctor–what would have been called a\ndrunkard, had she not been the wife of a prince. Her “dipsomania” took an\nunaggressive form, as she was by nature gentle and sweet; she simply used\nto shut herself in and drink until she would cry herself into a timid,\nsuppressed hysteria. So secret was she that Theresa never knew the truth\nabout these “spells.”",
        "Howland did not like Ross; but when Theresa told him she was going to\nmarry him she had only to cry a little and sit in the old man’s lap and\ntease. “Very well, then,” said her father, “you can have him. But he’s a\ngambler, like his father. They call it finance, but changing the name of\na thing only changes the smell of it, not the thing itself. I’m going to\ntie my money up so that he can’t get at it.”",
        "“I want you to, papa,” replied Theresa, giving him a kiss and a great hug\nfor emphasis. “I don’t want anybody to be able to touch my property.”",
        "For the wedding, Howland gave Theresa a free hand. “I’ll pay the bills,\nno matter what they are,” said he. “Give yourself a good time.” And\nTheresa, who had been brought up to be selfish, and was prudent about her\nimpulses only where she suspected them of being generous, proceeded to\narrange for herself the wedding that is still talked about in Chicago\n\"society” and throughout the Middle West. A dressmaker from the Rue de la\nPaix came over with models and samples, and carried back a huge order and\na plaster reproduction of Theresa’s figure, and elaborate notes on the\ncolor of her skin, hair, eyes, and her preferences in shapes of hats. A\njeweler, also of the Rue de la Paix, came with jewels–nearly a million\ndollars’ worth–for her to make selections. Her boots and shoes and\nslippers she got from Rowney, in Fifth Avenue, who, as everybody knows,\nmakes nothing for less than thirty-five dollars, and can put a hundred\ndollars worth of price, if not of value, into a pair of evening slippers.\nTheresa was proud of her feet; they were short and plump, and had those\nabrupt, towering insteps that are regarded by the people who have them as\nunfailing indications of haughty lineage, just as the people who have\nflat feet dwell fondly upon the flat feet of the Wittlesbachs, kings in\nBavaria. She was not easy to please in the matter of casements for those\nfeet; also, as she was very short in stature, she had to get three and a\nhalf extra inches of height out of her heels; and to make that sort of\nheel so that it can even be hobbled upon is not easy or cheap. Once\nTheresa, fretting about her red-ended nose and muddy skin, had gone to a\nspecialist. “Let me see your foot,” said he; and when he saw the heel, he\nexclaimed: “Cut that tight, high-heeled thing out or you’ll never get a\ndecent skin, and your eyes will trouble you by the time you are thirty.\"\nBut Theresa, before adopting such drastic measures, went to a beauty\ndoctor. He assured her that she could be cured without the sacrifice of\nthe heel, and that the weakness of her eyes would disappear a year or so\nafter marriage. And he was soon going into ecstasies over her\nimprovement, over the radiance of her beauty. She saw with his eyes and\nceased to bother about nose or skin–they were the least beautiful of her\nbeauties, but–\"One can’t expect to be absolutely perfect. Besides, the\nabsolutely perfect kind of beauty might be monotonous.”",
        "The two weeks before the wedding were the happiest of her life. All day\nlong, each day, vans were thundering up to the rear doors of Windrift,\neach van loaded to bursting with new and magnificent, if not beautiful\ncostliness. The house was full of the employees of florists, dressmakers,\ndecorators, each one striving to outdo the other in servility. Theresa\nwas like an autocratic sovereign, queening it over these menials and\nfancying herself adored. They showed so plainly that they were awed by\nher and were in ecstasies of admiration over her taste. And, as the\ngrounds and the house were transformed, Theresa’s exaltation grew until\nshe went about fairly dizzy with delight in herself.",
        "The bridesmaids and ushers came. They were wealth-worshipers all, and\ntheir homage lifted Theresa still higher. They marched and swept about in\nher train, lording it over the menials and feeling that they were not a\nwhit behind the grand ladies and gentlemen of the French courts of the\neighteenth century. They had read the memoirs of that idyllic period\ndiligently, had read with minds only for the flimsy glitter which hid the\nvulgarity and silliness and shame as a gorgeous robe hastily donned by a\ndirty chambermaid might conceal from a casual glance the sardonic and\nrepulsive contrast. The wedding day approached all too swiftly for\nTheresa and her court. True, that would be the magnificent climax; but\nthey knew it would also dissipate the spell–after the wedding, life in\ntwentieth century America again.",
        "“If only it don’t rain!” said Harry Legendre.",
        "“It won’t,” replied Theresa with conviction–and her look of command\ntoward the heavens made the courtiers exchange winks and smiles behind\nher back. They were courtiers to wealth, not to Theresa, just as their\nEuropean prototypes are awed before a “king’s most excellent Majesty,\"\nnot before his swollen body and shrunken brain.",
        "And it did not rain. Ross arrived in the red sunset of the wedding eve,\nTom Glenning, his best man, coming with him. They were put, with the\nushers, in rooms at the pavilion where were the squash courts and winter\ntennis courts and the swimming baths. Theresa and Ross stood on the front\nporch alone in the moonlight, looking out over the enchantment-like scene\ninto which the florists and decorators had transformed the terraces and\ngardens. She was a little alarmed by his white face and sunken eyes; but\nshe accepted his reassurances without question–she would have\ndisbelieved anything which did not fit in with her plans. And now, as\nthey gazed out upon that beauty under the soft shimmer of the moonlight,\nher heart suddenly expanded in tenderness. “I am so happy,” she\nmurmured, slipping an arm through his.",
        "Her act called for a return pressure. He gave it, much as a woman’s\nsalutation would have made him unconsciously move to lift his hat.",
        "“While Adele was dressing me for dinner–” she began.",
        "At that name, he moved so that her arm dropped from his; but she did not\nconnect her maid with her former bosom friend.",
        "“I got to thinking about those who are not so well off as we,” she went\non; “about the poor. And so, I’ve asked papa to give all his employees\nand the servants nice presents, and I’ve sent five thousand dollars to be\ndivided among the churches in the town, down there–for the poor. Do you\nthink I did wrong? I’m always afraid of encouraging those kind of people\nto expect too much of us.”",
        "She had asked that he might echo the eulogies she had been bestowing\nupon herself. But he disappointed her. “Oh, I guess it was well\nenough,” he replied. “I must go down to the pavilion. I’m fagged, and\nyou must be, too.”",
        "The suggestion that he might not be looking his best on the morrow was\nenough to change the current of her thoughts. “Yes, do, dear!” she\nurged. “And don’t let Tom and Harry and the rest keep you up.”",
        "They did not even see him. He sat in the shed at the end of the\nboat-landing, staring out over the lake until the moon set. Then he went\nto the pavilion. It was all dark; he stole in, and to bed, but not to\nsleep. Before his closed but seeing eyes floated a vision of two\nwomen–Adelaide as he had last seen her, Theresa as she looked in the\nmornings, as she had looked that afternoon.",
        "He was haggard next day. But it was becoming to him, gave the\nfinishing touch to his customary bored, distinguished air; and he\nwas dressed in a way that made every man there envy him. As Theresa, on\ninsignificant-looking little Bill Howland’s arm, advanced to meet him at\nthe altar erected under a canopy of silk and flowers in the bower of\nlilies and roses into which the big drawing-room had been transformed,\nshe thrilled with pride. There was a man one could look at with\ndelight, as one said, “My husband!”",
        "It was a perfect day–perfect weather, everything going forward without\nhitch, everybody looking his and her best, and “Mama” providentially\ncompelled by one of her “spells” to keep to her room. Those absences of\nhers were so frequent and so much the matter of course that no one gave\nthem a second thought. Theresa had studied up the customs at fashionable\nEnglish and French weddings, and had combined the most aristocratic\nfeatures of both. Perhaps the most successful feature was when she and\nRoss, dressed for the going away, walked, she leaning upon his arm,\nacross the lawns to the silk marquee where the wedding breakfast was\nserved. Before them, walking backward, were a dozen little girls from the\nvillage school, all in white, strewing roses from beribboned baskets, and\nsinging, “Behold! The bride in beauty comes!”",
        "“Well, I’m glad it’s all over,” said Theresa as she settled back in a\nchair in the private car that was to take them to Wilderness Lodge, in\nnorthern Wisconsin for the honeymoon.",
        "“So am I,” Ross disappointed her by saying. “I’ve felt like a damn fool\never since I began to face that gaping gang.”",
        "“But you must admit it was beautiful,” objected Theresa pouting.",
        "Ross shut his teeth together to keep back a rude reply. He was\nunderstanding how men can be brutal to women. To look at her was to have\nan all but uncontrollable impulse to rise up and in a series of noisy and\nprofane explosions reveal to her the truth that was poisoning him. After\na while, a sound from her direction made him glance at her. She was\nsobbing. He did not then know that, to her, tears were simply the means\nto getting what she wanted; so his heart softened. While she was thinking\nthat she was looking particularly well and femininely attractive, he was\npitying her as a forlorn creature, who could never inspire love and ought\nto be treated with consideration, much as one tries to hide by an\neffusive show of courtesy the repulsion deformity inspires.",
        "“Don’t cry, Theresa,” he said gently, trying to make up his mind to touch\nher. But he groaned to himself, “I can’t! I must wait until I can’t see\nher.” And he ordered the porter to bring him whisky and soda.",
        "“Won’t you join me?” he said.",
        "“You know, I never touch anything to drink,” she replied. “Papa and Dr.\nMassey both made me promise not to.”",
        "Ross’s hand, reaching out for the bottle of whisky, drew slowly back. He\naverted his face that she might not see. He knew about her mother–and\nknew Theresa did not. It had never entered his head that the weakness of\nthe mother might be transmitted to the daughter. Now–Just before they\nleft, Dr. Massey had taken him aside and, in a manner that would have\nimpressed him instantly but for his mood, had said: “Mr. Whitney, I want\nyou never to forget that Theresa must not be depressed. You must take the\ngreatest care of her. We must talk about it again–when you return.”",
        "And this was what he meant!",
        "He almost leaped to his feet at Theresa’s softly interrupting voice, “Are\nyou ill, dear?”",
        "“A little–the strain–I’ll be all right–” And leaving the whisky\nuntouched, he went into his own compartment. As he was closing the door,\nhe gave a gasp of dismay. “She might begin now!” he muttered. He rang for\nthe porter. “Bring that bottle,” he said. Then, as an afterthought of\n\"appearances,” “And the soda and a glass.”",
        "“I can get you another, sir,” said the porter.",
        "“No–that one,” ordered Ross.",
        "Behind the returning porter came Theresa. “Can’t I do something for you,\ndear? Rub your head, or fix the pillows?”",
        "Ross did not look at her. “Do, please–fix the pillows,” he said. “Then\nif I can sleep a little, I’ll be all right, and will soon rejoin you.”",
        "“Can’t I fix your drink for you?” she asked, putting her hand on\nthe bottle.",
        "Ross restrained an impulse to snatch it away from her. “Thanks,\nno–dear,” he answered. “I’ve decided to swear off–with you. Is it a\ngo?”",
        "She laughed. “Silly!” she murmured, bending and kissing him. “If\nyou wish.”",
        "“That settles it,” said Ross, with a forced, pained smile. “We’ll neither\nof us touch it. I was getting into the habit of taking too much–not\nreally too much–but–Oh, you understand.”",
        "“That’s the way father feels about it,” said Theresa, laughing. “We never\ndrink at home–except mother when she has a spell, and has to be kept up\non brandy.”",
        "Ross threw his arm up to hide his face. “Let me sleep, do,” he\nsaid gently.",
        "As Dory had several months’ work before him at Paris, he and Del took a\nfurnished apartment in the Rue de Rivoli, high up, attractive within,\nbefore its balconied windows the stately trees, the fountains, the bright\nflower beds, the thronged playgrounds of the Tuileries. But they were not\nlong left to themselves; in their second week, the concierge’s little\ngirl late one afternoon brought Janet’s card up to Adelaide. As Janet\nentered, Del regretted having yielded to impulse and admitted her. For,\nthe granddaughter of “blue-jeans Jones,” the tavern keeper, was looking\nthe elegant and idle aristocrat from the tip of the tall, graceful plume\nin her most Parisian of hats to the buckles of shoes which matched her\ndress, parasol, and jewels. A lovely Janet, a marvelous Janet; a toilette\nit must have taken her two hours to make, and spiritual hazel eyes that\nforbade the idea of her giving so much as a moment’s thought to any\nmaterial thing, even to dress. Adelaide had spent with the dressmakers a\ngood part of the letter of credit her mother slipped into her traveling\nbag at the parting; she herself was in a negligee which had as much style\nas Janet’s costume and, in addition, individual taste, whereof Janet had\nbut little; and besides, while her beauty had the same American\ndelicateness, as of the finest, least florid Sèvres or Dresden, it also\nhad a look of durability which Janet’s beauty lacked–for Janet’s beauty\ndepended upon those fragilities, coloring and contour. Adelaide was not\nnotably vain, had a clear sense of her defects, tended to exaggerate\nthem, rather than her many and decisive good points. It was not Janet’s\nappearance that unsettled Del; she brought into the room the atmosphere\nDel had breathed during all those important years of girlhood, and had\nnot yet lost her fondness for. It depressed her at once about herself to\nnote how this vision of the life that had been but would never be again\naffected her.",
        "“You are sad, dear,” said Janet, as she kissed her on both cheeks with a\ndiffusing of perfume that gave her a sense of a bouquet of priceless\nexotics waving before her face.",
        "“You are sad, dear,” she repeated, with that air of tenderest sympathy\nwhich can be the safest cover for subtle malice.",
        "Adelaide shrank.",
        "“I’m so glad I’ve come when I may be able to do some good.”",
        "Adelaide winced.",
        "“How cozy these rooms are–”",
        "At “cozy” Adelaide shuddered. No one ever used, except apologetically,\nthat word, which is the desperate last resort of compliment.",
        "“And what a beautiful view from the windows–so much better than ours at\nthe pompous old Bristol, looking out on that bare square!”",
        "Adelaide laughed. Not by chance, she knew, did Miss Janet, with her\nsoftly sheathed but swift and sharp cat claws, drag in the delicate hint\nthat while Adelaide was “cozy” in an unaristocratic maison meublée, she\nherself was ensconced in the haunts of royalty; and it suddenly came back\nto Del how essentially cheap was “aristocracy.”",
        "“But I mustn’t look at those adorable gardens,” continued Janet. “They\nfill me with longing for the country, for the pure, simple things. I am\nso sick of the life mamma and I lead. And you are married to dear\nDory–how romantic! And I hear that Arthur is to marry Margaret\nSchultz–or whatever her name was–that splendid creature! She was a\ndear friend of the trained nurse I had last spring, and what the nurse\ntold me about her made me positively love her. Such character! And\ngetting ready to lead such a useful life.” This without the least\nsuggestion of struggle with a difficult subject. “Arthur is a noble\nfellow, too. If we had been in spiritual accord, I’d have loved to go and\nlead his life with him.”",
        "Adelaide was in high good humor now–Janet was too preposterous to be\ntaken seriously. “What do you want me to do for you, Jen?” said she.",
        "“Why, nothing!” exclaimed Janet, looking a little wonder and much\nreproach.",
        "Del laughed. “Now, really, Jen,” said she. “You know you never in the\nworld went to all the trouble of getting my address, and then left\nroyalty at the Bristol for a maison meublée, four flights up and no\nelevator, just to see me!”",
        "“I had thought of something I was sure would give you pleasure,” said\nJanet, injured.",
        "“What do you want me to do for you?” repeated Adelaide, with smiling\npersistence.",
        "“Mamma and I have an invitation to spend a week at Besançon–you know,\nit’s the splendid old chateau Louis Treize used to love to visit. It’s\nstill the seat of the Saint Berthè family, and the present Marquis, a\ndear friend of ours, is such a wonderful, fine old nobleman–so simple\nand gracious and full of epigrams. He really ought to wear lace and\nruffles and a beautiful peruke. At any rate, as I was saying, he has\nasked us down. But mamma has to go to England to see papa before he\nsails, and I thought you’d love to visit the chateau–you and Dory. It’s\nso poetic–and historic, too.”",
        "“Your mother is going away and you’ll be unable to make this visit unless\nyou get a chaperon, and you want me to chaperon you,” said Adelaide, who\nwas not minded to be put in the attitude of being the recipient of a\nfavor from this particular young woman at this particular time, when in\ntruth she was being asked to confer a favor. “Adversity” had already\nsharpened her wits to the extent of making her alert to the selfishness\ndisguised as generosity which the prosperous love to shower upon their\nlittle brothers and sisters of the poor. She knew at once that Janet must\nhave been desperately off for a chaperon to come to her.",
        "A look of irritation marred Janet’s spiritual countenance for an\ninstant. But she never permitted anything whatsoever to stand between her\nand what she wished. She masked herself and said sweetly: “Won’t you go,\ndear? I know you’ll enjoy it–you and Dory. And it would be a great favor\nto me. I don’t see how I can go unless you consent. You know, I mayn’t go\nwith just anyone.”",
        "Adelaide’s first impulse was to refuse; but she did not. She put off\ndecision by saying, “I’ll ask Dory to-night, and let you know in the\nmorning. Will that do?”",
        "“Perfectly,” said Janet, rising to go. “I’ll count on you, for I know\nDory will want to see the chateau and get a glimpse of life in the old\naristocracy. It will be so educational.”",
        "Dory felt the change in Del the instant he entered their little\nsalon–felt that during the day some new element had intruded into\ntheir friendly life together, to interrupt, to unsettle, and to cloud the\nbrightening vistas ahead. At the mention of Janet he began to understand.\nHe saw it all when she said with a show of indifference that deceived\nonly herself, “Wouldn’t you like to go down to Besançon?”",
        "“Not I,” replied he coldly. “Europe is full of that kind of places. You\ncan’t glance outdoors without seeing a house or a ruin where the sweat\nand blood of peasants were squandered.”",
        "“Janet thought you’d be interested in it as history,” persisted Adelaide,\nbeginning to feel irritated.",
        "“That’s amusing,” said Dory. “You might have told her that scandal isn’t\nhistory, that history never was made in such places. As for the people\nwho live there now, they’re certainly not worth while–the same\npretentious ignoramuses that used to live there, except they no longer\nhave fangs.”",
        "“You ought not to be so prejudiced,” said Adelaide, who in those days\noften found common sense irritating. She had the all but universal habit\nof setting down to “prejudice” such views as are out of accord with the\nset of views held by one’s business or professional or social associates.",
        "Her irritation confirmed Dory’s suspicions. “I spoke only for myself,\"\nsaid he. “Of course, you’ll accept Janet’s invitation. She included me\nonly as a matter of form.”",
        "“I couldn’t, without you.”",
        "“Why not?”",
        "“Well–wouldn’t, then.”",
        "“But I urge you to go–want you to go! I can’t possibly leave Paris, not\nfor a day–at present.”",
        "“I shan’t go without you,” said Adelaide, trying hard to make her tone\nfirm and final.",
        "Dory leaned across the table toward her–they were in the garden of a\ncafe in the Latin Quarter. “If you don’t go, Del,” said he, “you’ll make\nme feel that I am restraining you in a way far meaner than a direct\nrequest not to go. You want to go. I want you to go. There is no reason\nwhy you shouldn’t.”",
        "Adelaide smiled shamefacedly. “You honestly want to get rid of me?”",
        "“Honestly. I’d feel like a jailer, if you didn’t go.”",
        "“What’ll you do in the evenings?”",
        "“Work later, dine later, go to bed and get up earlier.”",
        "“Work–always work,” she said. She sighed, not wholly insincerely. “I\nwish I weren’t so idle and aimless. If I were the woman I ought to be–”",
        "“None of that–none of that!” he cried, in mock sternness.",
        "“I ought to be interested in your work.”",
        "“Why, I thought you were!” he exclaimed, in smiling astonishment.",
        "“Oh, of course, in a way–in an ’entertainment’ sort of way. I like to\nhear you talk about it–who wouldn’t? But I don’t give the kind of\ninterest I should–the interest that thinks and suggests and stimulates.”",
        "“Don’t be too sure of that,” said Dory. “The ’helpful’ sort of people are\nusually a nuisance.”",
        "But she knew the truth, though passion might still be veiling it from\nhim. Life, before her father’s will forced an abrupt change, had been to\nher a showman, submitting his exhibits for her gracious approval,\nshifting them as soon as she looked as if she were about to be bored; and\nthe change had come before she had lived long enough to exhaust and weary\nof the few things he has for the well-paying passive spectator, but not\nbefore she had formed the habit of making only the passive spectator’s\nslight mental exertion.",
        "“Dory is so generous,” she thought, with the not acutely painful kind of\nremorse we lay upon the penitential altar for our own shortcomings, “that\nhe doesn’t realize how I’m shirking and letting him do all the pulling.\"\nAnd to him she said, “If you could have seen into my mind while Janet was\nhere, you’d give me up as hopeless.”",
        "Dory laughed. “I had a glimpse of it just now–when you didn’t like it\nbecause I couldn’t see my way clear to taking certain people so seriously\nas you think they deserve.”",
        "“But you are prejudiced on that subject,” she maintained.",
        "“And ever shall be,” admitted he, so good-humoredly that she could not\nbut respond. “It’s impossible for me to forget that every luxurious idler\nmeans scores who have to work long hours for almost nothing in order that\nhe may be of no use to the world or to himself.”",
        "“You’d have the whole race on a dead level,” said Adelaide.",
        "“Of material prosperity–yes,” replied Dory. “A high dead level. I’d\nabolish the coarse, brutal contrasts between waste and want. Then there’d\nbe a chance for the really interesting contrasts–the infinite varieties\nof thought and taste and character and individuality.”",
        "“I see,” said Adelaide, as if struck by a new idea. “You’d have the\ncontrasts, differences among flowers, not merely between flower and weed.\nYou’d abolish the weeds.”",
        "“Root and stalk,” answered Dory, admiring her way of putting it. “My\nobjection to these aristocratic ideals is that they are so vulgar–and so\ndishonest. Is that prejudice?”",
        "“No–oh, no!” replied Del sincerely. “Now, it seems to me, I don’t care\nto go with Janet.”",
        "“Not to oblige me–very particularly? I want you to go. I want you to\nsee for yourself, Del.”",
        "She laughed. “Then I’ll go–but only because you ask it.”",
        "That was indeed an elegant company at Besançon–elegant in dress, elegant\nin graceful carelessness of manners, elegant in graceful sinuosities of\ncleverly turned phrases. But after the passing of the first and second\ndays’ sensations, Hiram and Ellen Ranger’s daughter began to have\nsomewhat the same feeling she remembered having as a little girl, when\nshe went to both the afternoon and the evening performances of the\ncircus. These people, going through always the same tricks in the same\nold narrow ring of class ideas, lost much of their charm after a few\nrepetitions of their undoubtedly clever and attractive performance; she\neven began to see how they would become drearily monotonous. “No wonder\nthey look bored,” she thought. “They are.” What enormous importance they\nattached to trifles! What ludicrous tenacity in exploded delusions! And\nwhat self-complacent claiming of remote, powerful ancestors who had\nfounded their families, when those ancestors would have disclaimed them\nas puny nonentities. Their ideas were wholly provided for them, precisely\nas were their clothes and every artistic thing that gave them\n\"background.” They would have made as absurd a failure of trying to\nevolve the one as the other. Yet they posed–and were widely accepted–as\nthe superiors of those who made their clothes and furniture and of those\nwho made their ideas. And she had thought Dory partly insincere, partly\nprejudiced when he had laughed at them. Why, he had only shown the\nplainest kind of American good sense. As for snobbishness, was not the\nsilly-child American brand of it less ridiculous than this unblushing and\nunconcealed self-reverence, without any physical, mental or material\njustification whatsoever? They hadn’t good manners even, because–as Dory\nhad once said–no one could have really good manners who believed, and\nacted upon the belief, that he was the superior of most of the members of\nhis own family–the human race.",
        "“I suppose I could compress myself back into being satisfied with this\nsort of people and things,” she thought, as she looked round the ballroom\nfrom which pose and self-consciousness and rigid conventionality had\nbanished spontaneous gayety. “I suppose I could even again come to\nfancying this the only life. But I certainly don’t care for it now.”",
        "But, although Adelaide was thus using her eyes and her mind–her own eyes\nand her own mind–in observing what was going on around her, she did not\ndisconcert the others, not even Janet, by expressing her thoughts. Common\nsense–absolute common sense–always sounds incongruous in a conventional\natmosphere. In its milder forms it produces the effect of wit; in\nstronger doses it is a violent irritant; in large quantity, it causes\nthose to whom it is administered to regard the person administering it as\ninsane. Perhaps Adelaide might have talked more or less frankly to Janet\nhad Janet not been so obviously in the highest of her own kind of\nheavens. She was raised to this pinnacle by the devoted attentions of the\nViscount Brunais, eldest son of Saint Berthè and the most agreeable and\nadaptable of men, if the smallest and homeliest. Adelaide spoke of his\nintelligence to Janet, when they were alone before dinner on the fourth\nday, and Janet at once responded.",
        "“And such a soul!” she exclaimed. “He inherits all the splendid, noble\ntraditions of their old, old family. You see in his face that he is\ndescended from generations of refinement and–and–freedom from contact\nwith vulgarizing work, don’t you?”",
        "“That hadn’t struck me,” said Adelaide amiably. “But he’s a well-meaning,\ngood-hearted little man, and, of course, he feels as at home in the\nsurroundings he’s had all his life as a bird on a bough. Who doesn’t?”",
        "“But when you know him better, when you know him as I know him–” Janet’s\nexpression disclosed the secret.",
        "“But won’t you be lonely–away off here–among–foreign people?\"\nsaid Adelaide.",
        "“Oh, I should love it here!” exclaimed Janet. “It seems to me I–he\nand I–must have lived in this very chateau in a former existence. We\nhave talked about it, and he agrees with me. We are so harmonious.”",
        "“You’ve really made up your mind to–to marry him?” Adelaide had almost\nsaid “to buy him\"; she had a sense that it was her duty to disregard\nJanet’s pretenses, and “buy” was so exactly the word to use with these\npeople to whom money was the paramount consideration, the thought behind\nevery other thought, the feeling behind every other feeling, the\nmainspring of their lives, the mainstay of all the fictions of their\naristocracy.",
        "“That depends on father,” replied Janet. “Mother has gone to talk to him\nabout it.”",
        "“I’m sure your father won’t stand between you and happiness,” said\nAdelaide.",
        "“But he doesn’t understand these aristocratic people,” replied she. “Of\ncourse, if it depended upon Aristide and me, we should be married without\nconsulting anybody. But he can’t legally marry without his father’s\nconsent, and his father naturally wants proper settlements. It’s a cruel\nlaw, don’t you think?”",
        "Adelaide thought not; she thought it, on the contrary, an admirable\ndevice to “save the face” of a mercenary lover posing as a sentimentalist\nand money-spurner. But she merely said, “I think it’s most\ncharacteristic, most aristocratic.” She knew Janet, how shrewd she was,\nhow thoroughly she understood the “coarse side of life.” She added, “And\nyour father’ll come round.”",
        "“I wish I could believe it,” sighed Janet. “The Saint Berthès have an\nexaggerated notion of papa’s wealth. Besides, they need a good deal. They\nwere robbed horribly by those dreadful revolutionists. They used to own\nall this part of the country. All these people round here with their\nlittle farms were once the peasants of Aristide’s ancestors. Now–even\nthis chateau has a mortgage on it. I couldn’t keep back the tears, while\nAristide was telling me.”",
        "Adelaide thought of Charles Whitney listening to that same recital, and\nalmost laughed. “Well, I feel sure it will turn out all right,” she said.\n\"Your mother’ll see to that. And I believe you’ll be very, very happy.\"\nTheatricals in private life was Janet’s passion–why should she not be\nhappy? Frenchmen were famous for their politeness and consideration to\ntheir wives; Aristide would never let her see or feel that she bored him,\nthat her reverence for the things he was too intelligent and modern not\nto despise appealed to him only through his sense of humor. Janet would\npush her shrewd, soulful way into social leadership, would bring her\nchildren up to be more aristocratic than the children of the oldest\naristocrats.",
        "Adelaide smiled as she pictured it all–smiled, yet sighed. She was not\nunder Janet’s fixed and unshakable delusions. She saw that high-sounding\ntitles were no more part of the personalities bearing them than the mass\nof frankly false hair so grandly worn by Aristide’s grand-aunt was part\nof the wisp-like remnant of natural head covering. But that other self of\nhers, so reluctant to be laughed or frowned down and out by the self that\nwas Hiram Ranger’s daughter, still forced her to share in the ancient,\nignorant allegiance to “appearances.” She did not appreciate how bored\nshe was, how impatient to be back with Dory, the never monotonous, the\nalways interesting, until she discovered that Janet, with her usual\nsubtlety, had arranged for them to stay another week, had made it\nimpossible for her to refuse without seeming to be disobliging and even\ndownright rude. They were to have returned to Paris on a Monday. On\nSunday she wrote Dory to telegraph for her on Tuesday.",
        "“I’d hate to be looking forward to that life of dull foolery,” thought\nshe, as the mossy bastions of Besançon drifted from her horizon–she was\njourneying up alone, Janet staying on with one of the Saint Berthè women\nas chaperone. “It is foolery and it is dull. I don’t see how grown-up\npeople endure it, unless they’ve never known any better. Yet I seem\nunable to content myself with the life father stands for–and Dory.” She\nappreciated the meaning of the legend of the creature with the two\nbodies and the two wills, each always opposed to the other, with the\nresult that all motion was in a dazing circle in which neither wished to\ngo. “Still,” she concluded, “I am learning\"–which was the truth;\nindeed, she was learning with astonishing rapidity for a girl who had had\nsuch an insidiously wrong start and was getting but slight encouragement.",
        "Dory, of course, was helping her, but not as he might. Instead of\nbringing to bear that most powerful of influences, the influence of\npassionate love, he held to his stupid compact with his supersensitive\nself–the compact that he would never intrude his longings upon her. He\nconstantly reminded himself how often woman gives through a sense of duty\nor through fear of alienating or wounding one she respects and likes;\nand, so he saw in each impulse to enter Eden boldly a temptation to him\nto trespass, a temptation to her to mask her real feelings and suffer it.\nThe mystery in which respectable womanhood is kept veiled from the male,\nhas bred in him an awe of the female that she does not fully realize or\naltogether approve–though she is not slow to advantage herself of it. In\nthe smaller cities and towns of the West, this awe of respectable\nwomanhood exists in a degree difficult for the sophisticated to believe\npossible, unless they have had experience of it. Dory had never had that\nfamiliarity with women which breeds knowledge of their absolute and\nunmysterious humanness. Thus, not only did he not have the key which\nenables its possessor to unlock them; he did not even know how to use it\nwhen Del offered it to him, all but thrust it into his hand. Poor Dory,\nindeed–but let only those who have not loved too well to love wisely\nstrut at his expense by pitying him; for, in matters of the heart,\nsophisticated and unsophisticated act much alike. “Men would dare much\nmore, if they knew what women think,” says George Sand. It is also true\nthat the men who dare most, who win most, are those who do not stop to\nbother about what the women think. Thought does not yet govern the world,\nbut appetite and action–bold appetite and the courage of it.",
        "To give himself, journeyman cooper, the feeling of ease and equality,\nArthur dressed, with long-discontinued attention to detail, from his\nextensive wardrobe which the eighteen months since its last accessions\nhad not impaired or antiquated. And, in the twilight of an early\nSeptember evening, he went forth to settle the matter that had become the\nmost momentous.",
        "There is in dress a something independent of material and cut and even of\nthe individuality of the wearer; there is a spirit of caste. If the lady\ndons her maid’s dress, some subtle essence of the menial permeates her,\neven to her blood, her mind, and heart. The maid, in madame’s dress,\nputting on “airs,” is merely giving an outlet to that which has entered\ninto her from her clothes. Thus, Arthur assumed again with his ’grande\ntoilette” the feeling of the caste from which he had been ejected.\nMadelene, come herself to open the door for him, was in a summer dress of\nno pretentions to style other than that which her figure, with its large,\nfree, splendid lines, gave whatever she happened to wear. His nerves, his\nblood, responded to her beauty, as always; her hair, her features, the\ngrace of the movements of that strong, slender, supple form, gave him the\nsense of her kinship with freedom and force and fire and all things keen\nand bright. But stealthily and subtly it came to him, in this mood\nsuperinduced by his raiment, that in marrying her he was, after all,\nmaking sacrifices–she was ascending socially, he descending,\ncondescending. The feeling was far too vague to be at all conscious; it\nis, however, just those hazy, stealthy feelings that exert the most\npotent influence upon us. When the strong are conquered is it not always\nby feeble forces from the dark and from behind?",
        "“You have had good news,” said Madelene, when they were in the dim\ndaylight on the creeper-screened back porch. For such was her generous\ninterpretation of his expression of self-confidence and\nself-satisfaction.",
        "“Not yet,” he replied, looking away reflectively. “But I hope for it.”",
        "There wasn’t any mistaking the meaning of that tone; she knew what was\ncoming. She folded her hands in her lap, and there softly entered and\npervaded her a quiet, enormous content that made her seem the crown of\nthe quiet beauty of that evening sky whose ocean of purple-tinted crystal\nstretched away toward the shores of the infinite.",
        "“Madelene,” he began in a self-conscious voice, “you know what my\nposition is, and what I get, and my prospects. But you know what I was,\ntoo; and so, I feel I’ve the right to ask you to marry me–to wait until\nI get back to the place from which I had to come down.”",
        "The light was fading from the sky, from her eyes, from her heart. A\nmoment before he had been there, so near her, so at one with her; now\nhe was far away, and this voice she heard wasn’t his at all. And his\nwords–She felt alone in the dark and the cold, the victim of a cheat\nupon her deepest feelings.",
        "“I was bitter against my father at first,” he went on. “But since I have\ncome to know you I have forgiven him. I am grateful to him. If it hadn’t\nbeen for what he did I might never have learned to appreciate you, to–”",
        "“Don’t–please!” she said in the tone that is from an aching heart.\n\"Don’t say any more.”",
        "Arthur was astounded. He looked at her for the first time since he began;\ninstantly fear was shaking his self-confidence at its foundations.\n\"Madelene!” he exclaimed. “I know that you love me!”",
        "She hid her face in her hands–the sight of them, long and narrow and\nstrong, filled him with the longing to seize them, to feel the throb of\ntheir life thrill from them into him, troop through and through him like\nvictory-bringing legions into a besieged city. But her broken voice\nstopped him. “And I thought you loved me,” she said.",
        "“You know I do!” he cried.",
        "She was silent.",
        "“What is it, Madelene?” he implored. “What has come between us? Does your\nfather object because I am–am not well enough off?”",
        "She dropped her hands from before her face and looked at him. The first\ntime he saw her he had thought she was severe; ever since he had wondered\nhow he could have imagined severity into a countenance so gentle and\nsweet. Now he knew that his first impression was not imaginary; for she\nhad again the expression with which she had faced the hostile world of\nSaint X until he, his love, came into her life. “It is I that must ask\nyou what has changed you, Arthur,” she said, more in sadness than in\nbitterness, though in both. “I don’t seem to know you this evening.”",
        "Arthur lost the last remnant of his self-consciousness. He saw he was\nabout to lose, if indeed he had not already lost, that which had come to\nmean life to him–the happiness from this woman’s beauty, the strength\nfrom her character, the sympathy from her mind and heart. It was in\nterror that he asked: “Why, Madelene? What is it? What have I done?” And\nin dread he studied her firm, regular profile, a graceful strength that\nwas Greek, and so wonderfully completed by her hair, blue black and thick\nand wavy about the temple and ear and the nape of the neck.",
        "The girl did not answer immediately; he thought she was refusing to hear,\nyet he could find no words with which to try to stem the current of those\nominous thoughts. At last she said: “You talk about the position you have\n’come down from’ and the position you are going back to–and that you are\ngrateful to your father for having brought you down where you were humble\nenough to find me.”",
        "“Madelene!”",
        "“Wait!” she commanded. “You wish to know what is the matter with me. Let\nme tell you. We didn’t receive you here because you are a cooper or\nbecause you had been rich. I never thought about your position or your\nprospects. A woman–at least a woman like me–doesn’t love a man for his\nposition, doesn’t love him for his prospects. I’ve been taking you at\njust what you were–or seemed to be. And you–you haven’t come, asking me\nto marry you. You treat me like one of those silly women in what they\ncall ’society’ here in Saint X. You ask me to wait until you can support\nme fashionably–I who am not fashionable–and who will always support\nmyself. What you talked isn’t what I call love, Arthur. I don’t want to\nhear any more about it–or, we might not be able to be even friends.”",
        "She paused; but Arthur could not reply. To deny was impossible, and he\nhad no wish to attempt to make excuses. She had shown him to himself, and\nhe could only echo her just scorn.",
        "“As for waiting,” she went on, “I am sure, from what you say, that if you\never got back in the lofty place of a parasite living idly and foolishly\non what you abstracted from the labor of others, you’d forget me–just as\nyour rich friends have forgotten you.” She laughed bitterly. “O Arthur,\nArthur, what a fraud you are! Here, I’ve been admiring your fine talk\nabout your being a laborer, about what you’d do if you ever got the\npower. And it was all simply envy and jealousy and trying to make\nyourself believe you weren’t so low down in the social scale as you\nthought you were. You’re too fine a gentleman for Madelene Schulze,\nArthur. Wait till you get back your lost paradise; then take a wife who\ngives her heart only where her vanity permits. You don’t want me, and\nI–don’t want you!”",
        "Her voice broke there. With a cry that might have been her name or just\nan inarticulate call from his heart to hers, he caught her in his arms,\nand she was sobbing against his shoulder. “You can’t mean it, Madelene,\"\nhe murmured, holding her tight and kissing her cheek, her hair, her ear.\n\"You don’t mean it.”",
        "“Oh, yes, I do,” she sobbed. “But–I love you, too.”",
        "“Then everything else will straighten out of itself. Help me, Madelene.\nHelp me to be what we both wish me to be–what I can’t help being, with\nyou by my side.”",
        "When a vanity of superiority rests on what used to be, it dies much\nharder than when it rests upon what is. But Arthur’s self-infatuation,\nbased though it was on the “used-to-be,” then and there crumbled and\nvanished forever. Love cleared his sight in an instant, where reason\nwould have striven in vain against the stubborn prejudices of snobbism.\nMadelene’s instinct had searched out the false ring in his voice and\nmanner; it was again instinct that assured her all was now well. And she\nstraightway, and without hesitation from coquetry or doubt, gave herself\nfrankly to the happiness of the love that knows it is returned in kind\nand in degree.",
        "“Yes, everything else will come right,” she said. “For you arestrong, Arthur.”",
        "“I shall be,” was his reply, as he held her closer. “Do I not love a\nwoman who believes in me?”",
        "“And who believes because she knows.” She drew away to look at him. “You\nare like your father!” she exclaimed. “Oh, my dear, my love, how rich\nhe made you–and me!”",
        "At breakfast, the next morning, he broke the news to his mother. Instead\nof returning his serene and delighted look she kept her eyes on her plate\nand was ominously silent. “When you are well acquainted with her, mother,\nyou’ll love her,” he said. He knew what she was thinking–Dr. Schulze’s\n\"unorthodox” views, to put it gently; the notorious fact that his\ndaughters did not frown on them; the family’s absolute lack of standing\nfrom the point of view of reputable Saint X.",
        "“Well,” said his mother finally, and without looking at her big, handsome\nson, “I suppose you’re set on it.”",
        "“Set–that’s precisely the word,” replied Arthur. “We’re only waiting for\nyour consent and her father’s.”",
        "“I ain’t got anything to do with it,” said she, with a pathetic\nattempt at a smile. “Nor the old doctor, either, judging by the look of\nthe young lady’s eyes and chin. I never thought you’d take to a\nstrong-minded woman.”",
        "“You wouldn’t have her weak-minded, would you, mother?”",
        "“There’s something between.”",
        "“Yes,” said he. “There’s the woman whose mind is weak when it ought to be\nstrong, and strong when it ought to be weak. I decided for one like you,\nmother dear–one that would cure me of foolishness and keep me cured.”",
        "“A female doctor!”",
        "Arthur laughed. “And she’s going to practice, mother. We shouldn’t\nhave enough to live on with only what I’d make–or am likely to make\nanyway soon.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger lifted her drooping head in sudden panic.",
        "“Why, you’ll live here, won’t you?”",
        "“Of course,” replied Arthur, though, as a matter of fact, he hadn’t\nthought where they would live. He hastened to add, “Only we’ve got to\npay board.”",
        "“I guess we won’t quarrel about that,” said the old woman, so immensely\nrelieved that she was almost resigned to the prospect of a Schulze, a\nstrong-minded Schulze and a practicing female doctor, as a\ndaughter-in-law.",
        "“Madelene is coming up to see you this morning,” continued Arthur. “I\nknow you’ll make her–welcome.” This wistfully, for he was now awake to\nthe prejudices his mother must be fighting.",
        "“I’ll have the horses hitched up, and go and see her,” said Ellen,\npromptly. “She’s a good girl. Nobody could ever say a word against her\ncharacter, and that’s the main thing.” She began to contrast Madelene and\nJanet, and the situation brightened. At least, she was getting a\ndaughter-in-law whom she could feel at ease with, and for whom she could\nhave respect, possibly even liking of a certain reserved kind.",
        "“I suggested that you’d come,” Arthur was replying. “But Madelene said\nshe’d prefer to come to you. She thinks it’s her place, whether it’s\netiquette or not. We’re not going to go in for etiquette–Madelene\nand I.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger looked amused. This from the young man who had for years\nbeen “picking” at her because she was unconventional! “People will\nmisunderstand you, mother,” had been his oft-repeated polite phrase. She\ncouldn’t resist a mild revenge. “People’ll misunderstand, if she comes.\nThey’ll think she’s running after me.”",
        "Like all renegades, the renegades from the religion of conventionality\nare happiest when they are showing their contempt for that before which\nthey once knelt. “Let ’em think,” retorted Arthur cheerfully. “I’ll\ntelephone her it’s all right,” he said, as he rose from the table, “and\nshe’ll be up here about eleven.”",
        "And exactly at eleven she came, not a bit self-conscious or confused.\nMrs. Ranger looked up at her–she was more than a head the taller–and\nfound a pair of eyes she thought finest of all for their honesty\nlooking down into hers. “I reckon we’ve got–to kiss,” said she, with a\nnervous laugh.",
        "“I reckon so,” said Madelene, kissing her, and then, after a glance and\nan irresistible smile, kissing her again. “You were awfully put out when\nArthur told you, weren’t you?”",
        "“Well, you know, the saying is ’A bad beginning makes a good ending,’\"\nsaid Ellen. “Since there was only Arthur left to me, I hadn’t been\ncalculating on a daughter-in-law to come and take him away.”",
        "Madelene felt what lay behind that timid, subtle statement of the\ncase. Her face shadowed. She had been picturing a life, a home, with\njust Arthur and herself; here was a far different prospect opening up.\nBut Mrs. Ranger was waiting, expectant; she must be answered. “I\ncouldn’t take him away from you,” Madelene said. “I’d only lose him\nmyself if I tried.”",
        "Tears came into Ellen’s eyes and her hands clasped in her lap to steady\ntheir trembling. “I know how it is,” she said. “I’m an old woman,\nand\"–with an appeal for contradiction that went straight to Madelene’s\nheart–\"I’m afraid I’d be in the way?”",
        "“In the way!” cried Madelene. “Why, you’re the only one that can teach me\nhow to take care of him. He says you’ve always taken care of him, and I\nsuppose he’s too old now to learn how to look after himself.”",
        "“You wouldn’t mind coming here to live?” asked Ellen humbly. She hardly\ndared speak out thus plainly; but she felt that never again would there\nbe such a good chance of success.",
        "It was full a minute before Madelene could trust her voice to make reply,\nnot because she hesitated to commit herself, but because she was moved to\nthe depths of her tender heart by this her first experience of about the\nmost tragic of the everyday tragedies in human life–a lone old woman\npleading with a young one for a little corner to sit in and wait for\ndeath. “I wish it weren’t quite such a grand house,” she said at last\nwith a look at the old woman–how old she seemed just then!–a look that\nwas like light. “We’re too poor to have the right to make any such start.\nBut, if you’d let me–if you’re sure you wouldn’t think me an\nintruder–I’d be glad to come.”",
        "“Then that’s settled,” said Mrs. Ranger, with a deep sigh of relief.\nBut her head and her hands were still trembling from the nervous shock\nof the suspense, the danger that she would be left childless and alone.\n\"We’ll get along once you’re used to the idea of having me about. I\nknow my place. I never was a great hand at meddling. You’ll hardly know\nI’m around.”",
        "Again Madelene had the choke in her throat, the ache at the heart. “But\nyou wouldn’t throw the care of this house on my hands!” she exclaimed in\nwell-pretended dismay. “Oh, no, you’ve simply got to look after things!\nWhy, I was even counting on your helping me with my practice.”",
        "Ellen Ranger thrilled with a delight such as she had not had in many a\nyear–the matchless delight of a new interest. Her mother had been famous\nthroughout those regions in the pioneer days for skill at “yarbs” and at\nnursing, and had taught her a great deal. But she had had small chance to\npractice, she and her husband and her children being all and always so\nhealthy. All those years she had had to content herself with thinking and\ntalking of hypothetical cases and with commenting, usually rather\nseverely, upon the conduct of every case in the town of which she heard.\nNow, in her old age, just as she was feeling that she had no longer an\nexcuse for being alive, here, into her very house, was coming a career\nfor her, and it the career of which she had always dreamed!",
        "She forgot about the marriage and its problems, and plunged at once into\nan exposition of her views of medicine–her hostility to the allopaths,\nwith their huge, fierce doses of dreadful poisons that had ruined most of\nthe teeth and stomachs in the town; her disdain of the homeopaths, with\ntheir petty pills and their silly notion that the hair of the dog would\ncure its bite. She was all for the medicine of nature and common sense;\nand Madelene, able honestly to assent, rose in her esteem by leaps and\nbounds. Before the end of that conversation Mrs. Ranger was convinced\nthat she had always believed the doctors should be women. “Who\nunderstands a woman but a woman? Who understands a child but a woman? And\nwhat’s a man when he’s sick but a child?” She was impatient for the\nmarriage. And when Madelene asked if she’d object to having a small\ndoctor’s sign somewhere on the front fence, she looked astounded at the\nquestion. “We must do better than that,” she said. “I’ll have you an\noffice–just two or three rooms–built down by the street so as to save\npeople coming clear up here. That’d lose you many a customer.”",
        "“Yes, it might lose us a good many,” said Madelene, and you’d never have\nthought the “us” deliberate.",
        "That capped the climax. Mrs. Ranger was her new daughter’s thenceforth.\nAnd Madelene went away, if possible happier than when she and Arthur had\nstraightened it all out between themselves the night before. Had she not\nlifted that fine old woman up from the grave upon which she was wearily\nlying, waiting for death? Had she not made her happy by giving her\nsomething to live for? Something to live for! “She looked years\nyounger immediately,” thought Madelene. “That’s the secret of\nhappiness–something to live for, something real and useful.”",
        "“I never thought you’d find anybody good enough for you,” said Mrs.\nRanger to her son that evening. “But you have. She’s got a heart and a\nhead both–and most of the women nowadays ain’t got much of either.”",
        "And it was that night as Ellen was saying her prayers, that she asked God\nto forgive her the sin of secret protest she had let live deep in a dark\ncorner of her heart–reproach of Hiram for having cut off their son. “It\nwas for the best,” she said. “I see it now.”",
        "When Charles Whitney heard Arthur was about to be married, he offered him\na place on the office staff of the Ranger-Whitney Company at fifteen\nhundred a year. “It is less than you deserve on your record,” he wrote,\n\"but there is no vacancy just now, and you shall go up rapidly. I take\nthis opportunity to say that I regard your father’s will as the finest\nact of the finest man I ever knew, and that your conduct, since he left\nus, is a vindication of his wisdom. America has gone stark mad on the\nsubject of money. The day is not far distant when it has got to decide\nwhether property shall rule work or work shall rule property. Your father\nwas a courageous pioneer. All right-thinking men honor him.”",
        "This, a fortnight after his return from Europe, from marrying Janet to\nAristide, Viscount Brunais. He had yielded to his secret\nsnobbishness–Matilda thought it was her diplomacy–and had given Janet a\ndowry so extravagant that when old Saint Berthè heard the figures, he\ntook advantage of the fact that only the family lawyer was present to\npermit a gleam of nature to show through his mask of elegant indifference\nto the “coarse side of life.” Whitney had the American good sense to\ndespise his wife, his daughter, and himself for the transaction. For\nyears furious had been his protestations to his family, to his\nacquaintances, and to himself against “society,” and especially against\nthe incursions of that “worm-eaten titled crowd from the other side.” So\noften had he repeated those protests that certain phrases had become\nfixedly part of his conversation, to make the most noise when he was\nviolently agitated, as do the dead leaves of a long-withered but still\nfirmly attached bough. Thus he was regarded in Chicago as an American of\nthe old type; but being human, his strength had not been strong enough to\nresist the taint in the atmosphere he had breathed ever since he began to\nbe very rich and to keep the company of the pretentious. His originally\nsound constitution had been gradually undermined, just as “doing like\neverybody else\"–that is, everybody in his set of pirates disguised under\nmerchant flag and with a few deceptive bales of goods piled on deck–had\nundermined his originally sound business honor.",
        "Arthur answered, thanking him for the offered position, but declining it.\n\"What you say about my work,” he wrote, “encourages me to ask a favor. I\nwish to be transferred from one mechanical department to another until I\nhave made the round. Then, perhaps, I may venture to ask you to renew\nyour offer.”",
        "Whitney showed this to Ross. “Now, there’s the sort of son I’d be proud\nof!” he exclaimed.",
        "Ross lifted his eyebrows. “Really!” said he. “Why?”",
        "“Because he’s a man,” retorted his father, with obvious intent of\nsatirical contrast. “Because within a year or two he’ll know the business\nfrom end to end–as his father did–as I do.”",
        "“And what good will that do him?” inquired Ross, with fine irony. “You\nknow it isn’t in the manufacturing end that the money’s made nowadays. We\ncan hire hundreds of good men to manufacture for us. I should say he’d be\nwiser were he trying to get a practical education.”",
        "“Practical!”",
        "“Precisely. Studying how to stab competitors in the back and establish\nmonopoly. As a manager, he may some day rise to ten or fifteen thousand a\nyear–unless managers’ salaries go down, as it’s likely they will. As a\nfinancier, he might rise to–to our class.”",
        "Whitney grunted, the frown of his brows and the smile on his sardonic\nmouth contradicting each other. He could not but be pleased by the\nshrewdness of his son’s criticism of his own half-sincere,\nhalf-hypocritical tribute to virtues that were on the wane; but at the\nsame time he did not like such frank expression of cynical truth from a\nson of his. Also, he at the bottom still had some of the squeamishness\nthat was born into him and trained into him in early youth; he did not\nlike to be forced squarely to face the fact that real business had been\nrelegated to the less able or less honest, while the big rewards of\nriches and respect were for the sly and stealthy. Enforcing what Ross had\nsaid, there came into his mind the reflection that he himself had just\nbribed through the Legislature, for a comparatively trifling sum, a law\nthat would swell his fortune and income within the next five years more\nthan would a lifetime of devotion to business.",
        "He would have been irritated far more deeply had he known that Arthur\nwas as well aware of the change from the old order as was Ross, and that\ndeliberately and on principle he was refusing to adapt himself to the\nnew order, the new conditions of “success.” When Arthur’s manliness\nfirst asserted itself, there was perhaps as much of vanity as of pride\nin his acceptance of the consequences of Hiram’s will. But to an\nintelligent man any environment, except one of inaction or futile\naction, soon becomes interesting; the coming of Madelene was all that\nwas needed to raise his interest to enthusiasm. He soon understood his\nfellow-workers as few of them understood themselves. Every human group,\nof whatever size or kind, is apt to think its characteristics peculiar\nto itself, when in fact they are as universal as human nature, and the\nmodifications due to the group’s environment are insignificant matters\nof mere surface. Nationality, trade, class no more affect the oneness of\nmankind than do the ocean’s surface variations of color or weather\naffect its unchangeable chemistry. Waugh, who had risen from the ranks,\nHowells, who had begun as shipping clerk, despised those above whom they\nhad risen, regarded as the peculiar weaknesses of the working classes\nsuch universal failings as prejudice, short-sightedness, and shirking.\nThey lost no opportunity to show their lack of sympathy with the class\nfrom which they had sprung and to which they still belonged in reality,\ntheir devotion to the class plutocratic to which they aspired. Arthur,\nin losing the narrowness of the class from which he had been ejected,\nlost all class narrowness. The graduates from the top have the best\nchance to graduate into the wide, wide world of human brotherhood. By an\nartificial process–by compulsion, vanity, reason, love–he became what\nMadelene was by nature. She was one of those rare human beings born with\na just and clear sense of proportion. It was thus impossible for her to\nexaggerate into importance the trivial differences of mental stature.\nShe saw that they were no greater than the differences of men’s physical\nstature, if men be compared with mountains or any other just measure of\nthe vast scale on which the universe is constructed. And so it came\nnaturally to her to appreciate that the vital differences among men are\nmatters of character and usefulness, just as among things they are\nmatters of beauty and use.",
        "Arthur’s close friend was now Laurent Tague, a young cooper–huge,\ndeep-chested, tawny, slow of body and swift of mind. They had been\nfriends as boys at school. When Arthur came home from Exeter from his\nfirst long vacation, their friendship had been renewed after a fashion,\nthen had ended abruptly in a quarrel and a pitched battle, from which\nneither had emerged victor, both leaving the battle ground exhausted and\nanguished by a humiliating sense of defeat. From that time Laurent had\nbeen a “damned mucker” to Arthur, Arthur a “stuck-up smart Alec” to\nLaurent. The renewal of the friendship dated from the accident to\nArthur’s hand; it rapidly developed as he lost the sense of patronizing\nLaurent, and as Laurent for his part lost the suspicion that Arthur was\nsecretly patronizing him. Then Arthur discovered that Lorry had, several\nyears before, sent for a catalogue of the University of Michigan, had\nselected a course leading to the B.S. degree, had bought the necessary\ntext-books, had studied as men work only at that which they love for its\nown sake and not for any advantage to be got from it. His father, a\ncaptain of volunteers in the Civil War, was killed in the Wilderness; his\nmother was a washerwoman. His father’s father–Jean Montague, the first\nblacksmith of Saint X–had shortened the family name. In those early,\nnakedly practical days, long names and difficult names, such as naturally\ndevelop among peoples of leisure, were ruthlessly taken to the chopping\nblock by a people among whom a man’s name was nothing in itself, was\nsimply a convenience for designating him. Everybody called Jean Montague\n\"Jim Tague,” and pronounced the Tague in one syllable; when he finally\nacquiesced in the sensible, popular decision, from which he could not\nwell appeal, his very children were unaware that they were Montagues.",
        "Arthur told Lorry of his engagement to Madelene an hour after he told his\nmother–he and Lorry were heading a barrel as they talked. This supreme\nproof of friendship moved Laurent to give proof of appreciation. That\nevening he and Arthur took a walk to the top of Reservoir Hill, to see\nthe sun set and the moon rise. It was under the softening and expanding\ninfluence of the big, yellow moon upon the hills and valleys and ghostly\nriver that Laurent told his secret–a secret that in the mere telling,\nand still more in itself, was to have a profound influence upon the\npersons of this narrative.",
        "“When I was at school,” he began, “you may remember I used to carry the\nwashing to and fro for mother.”",
        "“Yes,” said Arthur. He remembered how he liked to slip away from home and\nhelp Lorry with the big baskets.",
        "“Well, one of the places I used to go to was old Preston Wilmot’s;\nthey had a little money left in those days and used to hire mother now\nand then.”",
        "“So the Wilmots owe her, too,” said Arthur, with a laugh. The\nuniversal indebtedness of the most aristocratic family in Saint X was\nthe town joke.",
        "Lorry smiled. “Yes, but she don’t know it,” he replied. “I used to do all\nher collecting for her. When the Wilmots quit paying, I paid for ’em–out\nof money I made at odd jobs. I paid for ’em for over two years. Then, one\nevening–Estelle Wilmot\"–Lorry paused before this name, lingered on it,\npaused after it–\"said to me–she waylaid me at the back gate–I always\nhad to go in and out by the alley way–no wash by the front gate for\nthem! Anyhow, she stopped me and said–all red and nervous–’You\nmustn’t come for the wash any more.’",
        "“’Why not?’ says I. ’Is the family complaining?’",
        "“’No,’ says she, ’but we owe you for two years.’",
        "“’What makes you think that?’ said I, astonished and pretty badly scared\nfor the minute.",
        "“’I’ve kept account,’ she said. And she was fiery red. ’I keep a list of\nall we owe, so as to have it when we’re able to pay.’”",
        "“What a woman she is!” exclaimed Arthur. “I suppose she’s putting by out\nof the profits of that little millinery store of hers to pay off the\nfamily debts. I hear she’s doing well.”",
        "“A smashing business,” replied Lorry, in a tone that made Arthur glance\nquickly at him. “But, as I was saying, I being a young fool and\nfrightened out of my wits, said to her: ’You don’t owe mother a cent,\nMiss Estelle. It’s all been settled–except a few weeks lately. I’m\ncollectin’, and I ought to know.’",
        "“I ain’t much of a hand at lying, and she saw straight through me. I\nguess what was going on in her head helped her, for she looked as if she\nwas about to faint. ’It’s mighty little for me to do, to get to see you,’\nI went on. ’It’s my only chance. Your people would never let me in at the\nfront gate. And seeing you is the only thing I care about.’ Then I set\ndown the washbasket and, being desperate, took courage and looked\nstraight at her. ’And,’ said I, ’I’ve noticed that for the last year you\nalways make a point of being on hand to give me the wash.’”",
        "Somehow a lump came in Arthur’s throat just then. He gave his\nHercules-like friend a tremendous clap on the knee. “Good for you,\nLorry!” he cried. ’That was the talk!”",
        "“It was,” replied Lorry. “Well, she got red again, where she had been\nwhite as a dogwood blossom, and she hung her head. ’You don’t deny it, do\nyou?’ said I. She didn’t make any answer. ’It wasn’t altogether to ask me\nhow I was getting on with my college course, was it, Miss Estelle?’ And\nshe said ’No’ so low that I had to guess at it.”",
        "Lorry suspended his story. He and Arthur sat looking at the moon.\nFinally Arthur asked, rather huskily, “Is that the end, Lorry?”",
        "Lorry’s keen, indolent face lit up with an absent and tender smile. “That\nwas the end of the beginning,” replied he.",
        "Arthur thrilled and resisted a feminine instinct to put his arm round his\nfriend. “I don’t know which of you is the luckier,” he said.",
        "Lorry laughed. “You’re always envying me my good disposition,” he went\non. “Now, I’ve given away the secret of it. Who isn’t happy when he’s got\nwhat he wants–heaven without the bother of dying first? I drop into her\nstore two evenings a week to see her. I can’t stay long or people would\ntalk. Then I see her now and again–other places. We have to be\ncareful–mighty careful.”",
        "“You must have been,” said Arthur. “I never heard a hint of this; and if\nanyone suspected, the whole town would be talking.”",
        "“I guess the fact that she’s a Wilmot has helped us. Who’d ever suspect a\nWilmot of such a thing?”",
        "“Why not?” said Arthur. “She couldn’t do better.”",
        "Lorry looked amused. “What’d you have said a few months ago, Ranger?”",
        "“But my father was a workingman.”",
        "“That was a long time ago,” Lorry reminded him. “That was when America\nused to be American. Anyhow, she and I don’t care, except about the\nmother. You know the old lady isn’t strong, especially the last year or\nso. It wouldn’t exactly improve her health to know there was anything\nbetween her daughter and a washerwoman’s son, a plain workingman at that.\nWe–Estelle and I–don’t want to be responsible for any harm to her.\nSo–we’re waiting.”",
        "“But there’s the old gentleman, and Arden–and Verbena!”",
        "Lorry’s cheerfulness was not ruffled by this marshaling of the full and\nformidable Wilmot array. “It’d be a pleasure to Estelle to give them a\nshock, especially Verbena. Did you ever see Verbena’s hands?”",
        "“I don’t think so,” replied Arthur; “but, of course, I’ve heard of\nthem.”",
        "“Did you know she wouldn’t even take hold of a knob to open a door, for\nfear of stretching them?”",
        "“She is a lady, sure.”",
        "“Well, Estelle’s not, thank God!” exclaimed Lorry. “She says one of her\ngrandmothers was the daughter of a fellow who kept a kind of pawn shop,\nand that she’s a case of atavism.”",
        "“But, Lorry,” said Arthur, letting his train of thought come to the\nsurface, “this ought to rouse your ambition. You could get anywhere you\nliked. To win her, I should think you’d exert yourself at the factory as\nyou did at home when you were going through Ann Arbor.”",
        "“To win her–perhaps I would,” replied Lorry. “But, you see, I’ve won\nher. I’m satisfied with my position. I make enough for us two to live on\nas well as any sensible person’d care to live. I’ve got four thousand\ndollars put by, and I’m insured for ten thousand, and mother’s got twelve\nthousand at interest that she saved out of the washing. I like to live.\nThey made me assistant foreman once, but I was no good at it. I couldn’t\n’speed’ the men. It seemed to me they got a small enough part of what\nthey earned, no matter how little they worked. Did you ever think, it\ntakes one of us only about a day to make enough barrels to pay his week’s\nwages, and that he has to donate the other five days’ work for the\nprivilege of being allowed to live? If I rose I’d be living off those\nfive days of stolen labor. Somehow I don’t fancy doing it. So I do my ten\nhours a day, and have evenings and Sundays for the things I like.”",
        "“Doesn’t Estelle try to spur you on?”",
        "“She used to, but she soon came round to my point of view. She saw what I\nmeant, and she hasn’t, any more than I, the fancy for stealing time from\nbeing somebody, to use it in making fools think and say you’re somebody,\nwhen you ain’t.”",
        "“It’d be a queer world if everybody were like you.”",
        "“It’d be a queer world if everybody were like any particular person,\"\nretorted Lorry.",
        "Arthur’s mind continually returned to this story, to revolve it, to\nfind some new suggestion as to what was stupid or savage or silly in the\npresent social system, as to what would be the social system of\nto-morrow, which is to to-day’s as to-day’s is to yesterday’s; for Lorry\nand Dr. Schulze and Madelene and his own awakened mind had lifted him\nout of the silly current notion that mankind is never going to grow any\nmore, but will wear its present suit of social clothes forever, will\nalways creep and totter and lisp, will never learn to walk and to talk.\nHe was in the habit of passing Estelle’s shop twice each day–early in\nthe morning, when she was opening, again when the day’s business was\nover; and he had often fancied he could see in her evening expression\nhow the tide of trade had gone. Now, he thought he could tell whether it\nwas to be one of Lorry’s evenings or not. He understood why she had so\neagerly taken up Henrietta Hastings’s suggestion, made probably with no\nidea that anything would come of it–Henrietta was full of schemes,\nevolved not for action, but simply to pass the time and to cause talk in\nthe town. Estelle’s shop became to him vastly different from a mere\nplace for buying and selling; and presently he was looking on the other\nside, the human side, of all the shops and businesses and material\nactivities, great and small. Just as a knowledge of botany makes every\nstep taken in the country an advance through thronging miracles, so his\nnew knowledge was transforming surroundings he had thought commonplace\ninto a garden of wonders. “How poor and tedious the life I marked out\nfor myself at college was,” he was presently thinking, “in comparison\nwith this life of realities!” He saw that Lorry, instead of being\nwithout ambitions, was inspired by the highest ambitions. “A good son, a\ngood lover, a good workman,” thought Arthur. “What more can a man be, or\naspire to be?” Before his mind’s eyes there was, clear as light, vivid\nas life, the master workman–his father. And for the first time Arthur\nwelcomed that vision, felt that he could look into Hiram’s grave, kind\neyes without flinching and without the slightest inward reservation of\nblame or reproach.",
        "It was some time before the bearing of the case of Lorry and Estelle\nupon the case of Arthur and Madelene occurred to him. Once he saw this he\ncould think of nothing else. He got Lorry’s permission to tell Madelene;\nand when she had the whole story he said, “You see its message to us?”",
        "And Madelene’s softly shining eyes showed that she did, even before her\nlips had the chance to say, “We certainly have no respectable excuse\nfor waiting.”",
        "“As soon as mother gets the office done,” suggested Arthur.",
        "On the morning after the wedding, at a quarter before seven, Arthur and\nMadelene came down the drive together to the new little house by the\ngate. And very handsome and well matched they seemed as they stood before\nher office and gazed at the sign: “Madelene Ranger, M.D.” She unlocked\nand opened the door; he followed her in. When, a moment later, he\nreappeared and went swinging down the street to his work, his expression\nwould have made you like him–and envy him. And at the window watching\nhim was Madelene. There were tears in her fine eyes, and her bosom was\nheaving in a storm of emotion. She was saying, “It almost seems wicked to\nfeel as happy as I do.”",
        "In Hiram Ranger’s last year the Ranger-Whitney Company made half a\nmillion; the first year under the trustees there was a small deficit.\nCharles Whitney was most apologetic to his fellow trustees who had given\nhim full control because he owned just under half the stock and was the\nbusiness man of the three. “I’ve relied wholly on Howells,” explained he.\n\"I knew Ranger had the highest opinion of his ability, but evidently he’s\none of those chaps who are good only as lieutenants. However, there’s no\nexcuse for me–none. During the coming year I’ll try to make up for my\nnegligence. I’ll give the business my personal attention.”",
        "But at the end of the second year the books showed that, while the\ncompany had never done so much business, there was a loss of half a\nmillion; another such year and the surplus would be exhausted. At the\ntrustees’ meeting, of the three faces staring gloomily at these ruinous\nfigures the gloomiest was Charles Whitney’s. “There can be only one\nexplanation,” said he. “The shifting of the centers of production is\nmaking it increasingly difficult to manufacture here at a profit.”",
        "“Perhaps the railways are discriminating against us,” suggested\nScarborough.",
        "Whitney smiled slightly. “That’s your reform politics,” said he. “You\nfellows never seek the natural causes for things; you at once accuse the\nfinanciers.”",
        "Scarborough smiled back at him. “But haven’t there been instances of\nrings in control of railways using their power for plants they were\ninterested in and against competing plants?”",
        "“Possibly–to a limited extent,” conceded Whitney. “But I hold to the\nold-fashioned idea. My dear sir, this is a land of opportunity–”",
        "“Still, Whitney,” interrupted Dr. Hargrave, “there may be something in\nwhat Senator Scarborough says.”",
        "“Undoubtedly,” Whitney hastened to answer. “I only hope there is. Then\nour problem will be simple. I’ll set my lawyers to work at once. If that\nis the cause\"–he struck the table resolutely with his clenched\nfist–\"the scoundrels shall be brought to book!”",
        "His eyes shifted as he lifted them to find Scarborough looking at him.\n\"You have inside connections with the Chicago railway crowd, have you\nnot, Mr. Whitney?” he inquired.",
        "“I think I have,” said Whitney, with easy candor. “That’s why I feel\nconfident your suggestion has no foundation–beyond your suspicion of all\nmen engaged in large enterprises. It’s a wonder you don’t suspect me.\nIndeed, you probably will.”",
        "He spoke laughingly. Scarborough’s answer was a grave smile.",
        "“My personal loss may save me from you,” Whitney went on. “I hesitate to\nspeak of it, but, as you can see, it is large–almost as large as the\nuniversity’s.”",
        "“Yes,” said Scarborough absently, though his gaze was still fixed on\nWhitney. “You think you can do nothing?”",
        "“Indeed I do not!” exclaimed Whitney. “I shall begin with the assumption\nthat you are right. And if you are, I’ll have those scoundrels in court\nwithin a month.”",
        "“And then?”",
        "The young senator’s expression and tone were calm, but Whitney seemed to\nfind covert hostility in them. “Then–justice!” he replied angrily.",
        "Dr. Hargrave beamed benevolent confidence. “Justice!” he echoed. “Thank\nGod for our courts!”",
        "“But when?” said Scarborough. As there was no answer, he went on: “In\nfive–ten–fifteen–perhaps twenty years. The lawyers are in no hurry–a\nbrief case means a small fee. The judges–they’ve got their places for\nlife, so there’s no reason why they should muss their silk gowns in\nundignified haste. Besides–It seems to me I’ve heard somewhere the\nphrase ’railway judges.’”",
        "Dr. Hargrave looked gentle but strong disapproval. “You are too\npessimistic, Hampden,” said he.",
        "“The senator should not let the wounds from his political fights\ngangrene,” suggested Whitney, with good-humored raillery.",
        "“Have you nothing but the court remedy to offer?” asked Scarborough, a\nslight smile on his handsome face, so deceptively youthful.",
        "“That’s quite enough,” answered Whitney. “In my own affairs I’ve never\nappealed to the courts in vain.”",
        "“I can believe it,” said Scarborough, and Whitney looked as if he had\nscented sarcasm, though Scarborough was correctly colorless. “But, if you\nshould be unable to discover any grounds for a case against the\nrailways?”",
        "“Then all we can do is to work harder than ever along the old lines–cut\ndown expenses, readjust wages, stop waste.” Whitney sneered politely.\n\"But no doubt you have some other plan to propose.”",
        "Scarborough continued to look at him with the same faint smile. “I’ve\nnothing to suggest–to-day,” said he. “The court proceedings will do no\nharm–you see, Mr. Whitney, I can’t get my wicked suspicion of your\nfriends out of my mind. But we must also try something less–less\nleisurely than courts. I’ll think it over.”",
        "Whitney laughed rather uncomfortably; and when they adjourned he lingered\nwith Dr. Hargrave. “We must not let ourselves be carried away by our\nyoung friend’s suspicions,” said he to his old friend. “Scarborough is a\nfine fellow. But he lacks your experience and my knowledge of practical\nbusiness. And he has been made something of a crank by combating the\nopposition his extreme views have aroused among conservative people.”",
        "“You are mistaken, Whitney,” replied the doctor. “Hampden’s views are\nsound. He is misrepresented by the highly placed rascals he has exposed\nand dislodged. But in these business matters we rely upon you.” He linked\nhis arm affectionately in that of the powerful and successful “captain of\nindustry” whom he had known from boyhood. “I know how devoted you are to\nTecumseh, and how ably you manage practical affairs; and I have not for a\nmoment lost confidence that you will bring us safely through.”",
        "Whitney’s face was interesting. There was a certain hangdog look in it,\nbut there was also a suggestion–very covert–of cynical amusement, as of\na good player’s jeer at a blunder by his opponent. His tone, however, was\nmelancholy, tinged with just resentment, as he said: “Scarborough forgets\nhow my own personal interest is involved. I don’t like to lose two\nhundred and odd thousand a year.”",
        "“Scarborough meant nothing, I’m sure,” said Hargrave soothingly. “He\nknows we are all single hearted for the university.”",
        "“I don’t like to be distrusted,” persisted Whitney sadly. Then\nbrightening: “But you and I understand each other, doctor. And we will\ncarry the business through. Every man who tries to do anything in this\nworld must expect to be misunderstood.”",
        "“You are mistaken about Scarborough, I know you are,” said Hargrave\nearnestly.",
        "Whitney listened to Hargrave, finally professed to be reassured; but,\nbefore he left, a strong doubt of Scarborough’s judgment had been\nimplanted by him in the mind of the old doctor. That was easy enough;\nfor, while Hargrave was too acute a man to give his trust impulsively, he\ngave without reserve when he did give–and he believed in Charles\nWhitney. The ability absolutely to trust where trust is necessary is as\nessential to effective character as is the ability to withhold trust\nuntil its wisdom has been justified; and exceptions only confirm a rule.",
        "Scarborough, feeling that he had been neglecting his trusteeship, now\ndevoted himself to the Ranger-Whitney Company.",
        "He had long consultations with Howells, and studied the daily and weekly\nbalance sheets which Howells sent him. In the second month after the\nannual meeting he cabled Dory to come home. The entire foundation upon\nwhich Dory was building seemed to be going; Saint X was, therefore, the\nplace for him, not Europe.",
        "“And there you have all I have been able to find out,” concluded\nScarborough, when he had given Dory the last of the facts and figures.\n\"What do you make of it?”",
        "“There’s something wrong–something rotten,” replied Dory.",
        "“But where?” inquired Scarborough, who had taken care not to speak or\nhint his vague doubts of Whitney. “Everything looks all right, except\nthe totals on the balance sheets.”",
        "“We must talk this over with some one who knows more about the business\nthan either of us.” Then he added, as if the idea had just come to him,\n\"Why not call in Arthur–Arthur Ranger?”",
        "Scarborough looked receptive, but not enthusiastic.",
        "“He has been studying this business in the most practical way ever since\nhis father died,” urged Dory. “It can’t do any harm to consult with him.\nWe don’t want to call in outside experts if we can help it.”",
        "“If we did we’d have to let Mr. Whitney select them,” said Scarborough.\nAnd he drew Dory out upon the subject of Arthur and got such complete and\nintelligent answers that he presently had a wholly new and true idea of\nthe young man whose boyish follies Saint X had not yet forgotten. “Yes,\nlet’s give Arthur a chance,” he finally said.",
        "Accordingly, they laid the case in its entirety before Arthur, and he\ntook home with him the mass of reports which Scarborough had gathered.\nNight after night he and Madelene worked at the problem; for both knew\nthat its solution would be his opportunity, their opportunity.",
        "It was Madelene who discovered the truth–not by searching the figures,\nnot by any process of surface reasoning, but by that instinct for motive\nwhich woman has developed through her ages of dealing with and in\nmotives only. “They must get a new management,” said she; “one that\nCharles Whitney has no control over.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because he’s wrecking the business to get hold of it. He wants the whole\nthing, and he couldn’t resist the chance the inexperience and confidence\nof the other two gave him.”",
        "“I see no indication of it,” objected Arthur, to draw her out. “On the\ncontrary, wherever he directly controls there’s a good showing.”",
        "“That’s it!” exclaimed Madelene, feeling that she now had her feet on\nthe firm ground of reason on which alone stupid men will discuss\npractical affairs.",
        "Arthur had lived with Madelene long enough to learn that her mind was\nindeed as clear as her eyes, that when she looked at anything she saw it\nas it was, and saw all of it. Like any man who has the right material in\nhim, he needed only the object lesson of her quick dexterity at stripping\na problem of its shell of nonessentials. He had become what the\nineffective call a pessimist. He had learned the primer lesson of large\nsuccess–that one must build upon the hard, pessimistic facts of human\nnature’s instability and fate’s fondness for mischief, not upon the\noptimistic clouds of belief that everybody is good and faithful and\nfriendly disposed and everything will “come out all right somehow.” The\ninstant Madelene suggested Whitney as the cause, Arthur’s judgment echoed\napproval; but, to get her whole mind as one gives it only in combating\nopposition, he continued to object. “But suppose,” said he, “Whitney\ninsists on selecting the new management? As he’s the only one competent,\nhow can they refuse?”",
        "“We must find a way round that,” replied Madelene. “It’s perfectly plain,\nisn’t it, that there’s only one course–an absolutely new management. And\nhow can Mr. Whitney object? If he’s not guilty he won’t object, because\nhe’ll be eager to try the obvious remedy. If he’s guilty he won’t\nobject–he’ll be afraid of being suspected.”",
        "“Dory suggested–” began Arthur, and stopped.",
        "“That you be put in as manager?”",
        "“How did you know that?”",
        "“It’s the sensible thing. It’s the only thing,” answered his wife. “And\nDory has the genius of good sense. You ought to go to Scarborough and ask\nfor the place. Take Dory with you.”",
        "“That’s good advice,” said Arthur, heartily.",
        "Madelene laughed. “When a man praises a woman’s advice, it means she has\ntold him to do what he had made up his mind to do anyhow.”",
        "Next day Scarborough called a meeting of the trustees. Down from Chicago\ncame Whitney–at the greatest personal inconvenience, so he showed his\ncolleagues, but eager to do anything for Tecumseh. Scarborough gave a\nclear and appalling account of how the Ranger-Whitney Company’s\nprosperity was slipping into the abyss like a caving sand bank, on all\nsides, apparently under pressure of forces beyond human control. “In view\nof the facts,” said he, in conclusion, “our sole hope is in putting\nourselves to one side and giving an entirely new management an entirely\nfree hand.”",
        "Whitney had listened to Scarborough’s speech with the funereal\ncountenance befitting so melancholy a recital. As Scarborough finished\nand sank back in his chair, he said, with energy and heartiness, “I agree\nwith you, senator. The lawyers tell me there are as yet no signs of a\ncase against the railways. Besides, the trouble seems to be, as I feared,\ndeeper than this possible rebating. Jenkins–one of my best men–I sent\nhim down to help Howells out–he’s clearly an utter failure–utter! And I\nam getting old. The new conditions of business life call for young men\nwith open minds.”",
        "“No, no!” protested Dr. Hargrave. “I will not consent to any change that\ntakes your hand off the lever, my friend. These are stormy times in our\nindustrial world, and we need the wise, experienced pilot.”",
        "Scarborough had feared this; but he and Dory, forced to choose between\ntaking him into their confidence and boldly challenging the man in whom\nhe believed implicitly, had chosen the far safer course. “While Mr.\nWhitney must appreciate your eulogy, doctor,” said he, suave yet with a\ncertain iciness, “I think he will insist upon the trial of the only plan\nthat offers. In our plight we must not shrink from desperate\nremedies–even a remedy as desperate as eliminating the one man who\nunderstands the business from end to end.” This last with slight emphasis\nand a steady look at Whitney.",
        "Whitney reddened. “We need not waste words,” said he, in his bluff, sharp\nvoice. “The senator and I are in accord, and we are the majority.”",
        "“At least, Mr. Whitney,” said the doctor, “you must suggest the new man.\nYou know the business world. We don’t.”",
        "A long pause; then from Whitney: “Why not try young Ranger?”",
        "Scarborough looked at him in frank amazement. By what process of infernal\ntelepathy had he found out? Or was there some deep reason why Arthur\nwould be the best possible man for his purpose, if his purpose was indeed\nmalign? Was Arthur his tool? Or was Arthur subtly making tools of both\nWhitney and himself?",
        "Dr. Hargrave was dumfounded. When he recovered himself sufficiently to\nspeak, it was to say, “Why, he’s a mere boy, Whitney–not yet thirty. He\nhas had no experience!”",
        "“Inexperience seems to be what we need,” replied Whitney, eyes twinkling\nsneeringly at Scarborough. “We have tried experience, and it is a\ndisastrous failure.”",
        "Scarborough was still reflecting.",
        "“True,” pursued Whitney, “the young man would also have the motive of\nself-interest to keep him from making a success.”",
        "“How is that?” inquired Scarborough.",
        "“Under the will,” Whitney reminded him, “he can buy back the property\nat its market value. Obviously, the less the property is worth, the\nbetter for him.”",
        "Scarborough was staggered. Was Arthur crafty as well as able? With the\nhuman conscience ever eager to prove that what is personally advantageous\nis also right, how easy for a man in his circumstances to convince\nhimself that any course would be justifiable in upsetting the “injustice\"\nof Hiram Ranger’s will.",
        "“However,” continued Whitney, “I’ve no doubt he’s as honest as his\nfather–and I couldn’t say more than that. The only question is whether\nwe can risk giving him the chance to show what there is in him.”",
        "Dr. Hargrave was looking dazedly from one of his colleagues to the other,\nas if he thought his mind were playing him a trick. “It is\nimpossible–preposterous!” he exclaimed.",
        "“A man has to make a beginning,” said Whitney. “How can he show what\nthere is in him unless he gets a chance? It seems to me, doctor, we owe\nit to Hiram to do this for the boy. We can keep an eye and a hand on him.\nWhat do you think, senator?”",
        "Scarborough had won at every stage of his career, not merely because he\nhad convictions and the courage of them, but chiefly because he had the\ncourage to carry through the plans he laid in trying to make his\nconvictions effective. He had come there, fixed that Arthur was the man\nfor the place; why throw up his hand because Whitney was playing into it?\nNothing had occurred to change his opinion of Arthur. “Let us try Arthur\nRanger,” he now said. “But let us give him a free hand.”",
        "He was watching Whitney’s face; he saw it change expression–a slight\nfrown. “I advise against the free hand,” said Whitney.",
        "“I protest against it!” cried Dr. Hargrave. “I protest against even\nconsidering this inexperienced boy for such a responsibility.”",
        "Scarborough addressed himself to Whitney. “If we do not give our new\nmanager, whoever he may be, a free hand, and if he should fail, how shall\nwe know whether the fault is his or–yours?”",
        "At the direct “yours” Scarborough thought Whitney winced; but his reply\nwas bland and frank enough. He turned to Dr. Hargrave. “The senator is\nright,” said he. “I shall vote with him.”",
        "“Then it is settled,” said Scarborough. “Ranger is to have absolute\ncharge.”",
        "Dr. Hargrave was now showing every sign of his great age; the anguish of\nimminent despair was in his deep-set eyes and in his broken, trembling\nvoice as he cried: “Gentlemen, this is madness! Charles, I implore you,\ndo not take such precipitate action in so vital a matter! Let us talk it\nover–think it over. The life of the university is at stake!”",
        "It was evident that the finality in the tones and in the faces of his\ncolleagues had daunted him; but with a tremendous effort he put down the\nweakness of age and turned fiercely upon Whitney to shame him from\nindorsing Scarborough’s suicidal policy. But Whitney, with intent of\nbrutality, took out his watch. “I have just time to catch my train,” said\nhe, indifferently; “I can only use my best judgment, doctor. Sorry to\nhave to disagree with you, but Senator Scarborough has convinced me.” And\nhaving thus placed upon Scarborough the entire responsibility for the\nevent of the experiment, he shook hands with his colleagues and hurried\nout to his waiting carriage.",
        "Dr. Hargrave dropped into a chair and stared into vacancy. In all those\nlong, long years of incessant struggle against heartbreaking obstacles he\nhad never lost courage or faith. But this blow at the very life of the\nuniversity and from its friends! He could not even lift himself enough to\nlook to his God; it seemed to him that God had gone on a far journey.\nScarborough, watching him, was profoundly moved. “If at the end of three\nmonths you wish Ranger to resign,” said he, “I shall see to it that he\ndoes resign. Believe me, doctor, I have not taken this course without\nconsidering all the possibilities, so far as I could foresee them.”",
        "The old president, impressed by his peculiar tone, looked up quickly.\n\"There is something in this that I don’t understand,” said he, searching\nScarborough’s face.",
        "Scarborough was tempted to explain. But the consequences, should he fail\nto convince Hargrave, compelled him to withhold. “I hope, indeed I feel\nsure, you will be astonished in our young friend,” said he, instead. “I\nhave been talking with him a good deal lately, and I am struck by the\nstrong resemblance to his father. It is more than mere physical\nlikeness.”",
        "With a sternness he could have shown only where principle was at stake,\nthe old man said: “But I must not conceal from you, senator, that I have\nthe gravest doubts and fears. You have alienated the university’s best\nfriend–rich, powerful, able, and, until you exasperated him, devoted to\nits interests. I regard you as having–unintentionally, and no doubt for\ngood motives–betrayed the solemn trust Hiram Ranger reposed in you.” He\nwas standing at his full height, with his piercing eyes fixed upon his\nyoung colleague’s.",
        "All the color left Scarborough’s face. “Betrayed is a strong\nword,” he said.",
        "“A strong word, senator,” answered Dr. Hargrave, “and used deliberately.\nI wish you good day, sir.”",
        "Hargrave was one of those few men who are respected without any\nreservation, and whose respect is, therefore, not given up without a\nsense of heavy loss. But to explain would be to risk rousing in him an\neven deeper anger–anger on account of his friend Whitney; so, without\nanother word, Scarborough bowed and went. “Either he will be apologizing\nto me at the end of three months,” said he to himself, “or I shall be\napologizing to Whitney and shall owe Tecumseh a large sum of money.”",
        "Both Madelene and Arthur had that instinct for comfort and luxury which\nis an even larger factor in advancement than either energy or\nintelligence. The idea that clothing means something more than warmth,\nfood something more than fodder, a house something more than shelter, is\nthe beginning of progress; the measure of a civilized man or woman is the\nmeasure of his or her passion for and understanding of the art of living.",
        "Madelene, by that right instinct which was perhaps the finest part of her\nsane and strong character, knew what comfort really means, knew the\ndifference between luxury and the showy vulgarity of tawdriness or\nexpensiveness; and she rapidly corrected, or, rather, restored, Arthur’s\ngood taste, which had been vitiated by his associations with fashionable\npeople, whose standards are necessarily always poor. She was devoted to\nher profession as a science; but she did not neglect the vital material\nconsiderations. She had too much self-respect to become careless about\nher complexion or figure, about dress or personal habits, even if she had\nnot had such shrewd insight into what makes a husband remain a lover, a\nwife a mistress. She had none of those self-complacent delusions which\nlure vain women on in slothfulness until Love vacates his neglected\ntemple. And in large part, no doubt, Arthur’s appearance–none of the\nstains and patches of the usual workingman, and this though he worked\nhard at manual labor and in a shop–was due to her influence of example;\nhe, living with such a woman, would have been ashamed not to keep “up to\nthe mark.” Also her influence over old Mrs. Ranger became absolute; and\nswiftly yet imperceptibly the house, which had so distressed Adelaide,\nwas transformed, not into the exhibit of fashionable ostentation which\nhad once been Adelaide’s and Arthur’s ideal, but into a house of comfort\nand beauty, with colors harmonizing, the look of newness gone from the\n\"best rooms,” and finally the “best rooms” themselves abolished. And\nEllen thought herself chiefly responsible for the change. “I’m gradually\ngetting things just about as I want ’em,” said she. “It does take a long\ntime to do anything in this world!” Also she believed, and a boundless\ndelight it was to her, that she was the cause of Madelene’s professional\nsuccess. Everyone talked of the way Madelene was getting on, and wondered\nat her luck. “She deserves it, though,” said they, “for she can all but\nraise the dead.” In fact, the secret was simple enough. She had been\ntaught by her father to despise drugs and to compel dieting and exercise.\nShe had the tact which he lacked; she made the allowances for human\nnature’s ignorance and superstition which he refused to make; she\nlessened the hardship of taking her common-sense prescriptions by veiling\nthem in medical hocus-pocus–a compromise of the disagreeable truth which\nher father had always inveighed against as both immoral and unwholesome.",
        "Within six months after her marriage she was earning as much as her\nhusband; and her fame was spreading so rapidly that not only women but\nalso men, and men with a contempt for the “inferior mentality of the\nfemale,” were coming to her from all sides. “You’ll soon have a huge\nincome,” said Arthur. “Why, you’ll be rich, you are so grasping.”",
        "“Indeed I am,” replied she. “The way to teach people to strive for high\nwages and to learn thrift is to make them pay full value for what they\nget. I don’t propose to encourage dishonesty or idleness. Besides, we’ll\nneed the money.”",
        "Arthur had none of that mean envy which can endure the prosperity of\nstrangers only; he would not even have been able to be jealous of his\nwife’s getting on better than did he. But, if he had been so disposed, he\nwould have found it hard to indulge such feelings because of Madelene.\nShe had put their married life on the right basis. She made him feel,\nwith a certainty which no morbid imagining could have shaken, that she\nloved and respected him for qualities which could not be measured by any\nof the world’s standards of success. He knew that in her eyes he was\nalready an arrived success, that she was absolutely indifferent whether\nothers ever recognized it or not. Only those who realize how powerful is\nthe influence of intimate association will appreciate what an effect\nliving with Madelene had upon Arthur’s character–in withering the ugly\nin it, in developing its quality, and in directing its strength.",
        "When Scarborough gave Arthur his “chance,” Madelene took it as the matter\nof course. “I’m sorry it has come so soon,” said she, “and in just this\nway. But it couldn’t have been delayed long. With so much to be done and\nso few able or willing to do it, the world can’t wait long enough for a\nman really to ripen. It’s lucky that you inherit from your father so many\nimportant things that most men have to spend their lives in learning.”",
        "“Do you think so?” said he, brightening; for, with the “chance” secure,\nhe was now much depressed by the difficulties which he had been\nresurveying from the inside point of view.",
        "“You understand how to manage men,” she replied, “and you understand\nbusiness.”",
        "“But, unfortunately, this isn’t business.”",
        "He was right. The problem of business is, in its two main factors,\nperfectly simple–to make a wanted article, and to put it where those who\nwant it can buy. But this was not Arthur Ranger’s problem, nor is it the\nproblem of most business men in our time. Between maker and customer,\nnowadays, lie the brigands who control the railways–that is, the\nhighways; and they with equal facility use or defy the law, according to\ntheir needs. When Arthur went a-buying grain or stave timber, he and\nthose with whom he was trading had to placate the brigands before they\ncould trade; when he went a-selling flour, he had to fight his way to the\nmarkets through the brigands. It was the battle which causes more than\nninety out of every hundred in independent business to fail–and of the\nremaining ten, how many succeed only because they either escaped the\nnotice of the brigands or compromised with them?",
        "“I wish you luck,” said Jenkins, when, at the end of two weeks of his\ntutelage, Arthur told him he would try it alone.",
        "Arthur laughed. “No, you don’t, Jenkins,” replied he, with good-humored\nbluntness. “But I’m going to have it, all the same.”",
        "Discriminating prices and freight rates against his grain, discriminating\nfreight rates against his flour; the courts either powerless to aid him\nor under the rule of bandits; and, on the top of all, a strike within two\nweeks after Jenkins left–such was the situation. Arthur thought it\nhopeless; but he did not lose courage nor his front of serenity, even\nwhen alone with Madelene. Each was careful not to tempt the malice of\nfate by concealments; each was careful also not to annoy the other with\nunnecessary disagreeable recitals. If he could have seen where good\nadvice could possibly help him, he would have laid all his troubles\nbefore her; but it seemed to him that to ask her advice would be as if\nshe were to ask him to tell her how to put life into a corpse. He\nimagined that she was deceived by his silence about the details of his\naffairs because she gave no sign, did not even ask questions beyond\ngeneralities. She, however, was always watching his handsome face with\nits fascinating evidences of power inwardly developing; and, as it was\nher habit to get valuable information as to what was going on inside her\nfellow-beings from a close study of surface appearances, the growing\ngauntness of his features, the coming out of the lines of sternness, did\nnot escape her, made her heart throb with pride even as it ached with\nsympathy and anxiety. At last she decided for speech.",
        "He was sitting in their dressing room, smoking his last cigarette as he\nwatched her braid her wonderful hair for the night. She, observing him in\nthe glass, saw that he was looking at her with that yearning for sympathy\nwhich is always at its strongest in a man in the mood that was his at\nsight of those waves and showers of soft black hair on the pallid\nwhiteness of her shoulders. Before he realized what she was about she was\nin his lap, her arms round his neck, his face pillowed against her cheek\nand her hair. “What is it, little boy?” she murmured, with that mingling\nof the mistress and the mother which every woman who ever loved feels for\nand, at certain times, shows the man she loves.",
        "He laughed. “Business–business,” said he. “But let’s not talk about\nit. The important thing is that I have you. The rest is–smoke!” And\nhe blew out a great cloud of it and threw the cigarette through the\nopen window.",
        "“Tell me,” she said; “I’ve been waiting for you to speak, and I can’t\nwait any longer.”",
        "“I couldn’t–just now. It doesn’t at all fit in with my thoughts.” And\nhe kissed her.",
        "She moved to rise. “Then I’ll go back to the dressing table. Perhaps\nyou’ll be able to tell me with the width of the room between us.”",
        "He drew her head against his again. “Very well–if I must, I will. But\nyou know all about it. For some mysterious reason, somebody–you say it’s\nWhitney, and probably it is–won’t let me buy grain or anything else as\ncheaply as others buy it. And for the same mysterious reason, somebody,\nprobably Whitney again, won’t let me get to market without paying a\nheavier toll than our competitors pay. And now for some mysterious reason\nsomebody, probably Whitney again, has sent labor organizers from Chicago\namong the men and has induced them to make impossible demands and to walk\nout without warning.”",
        "“And you think there’s nothing to do but walk out, too,” said Madelene.",
        "“Or wait until I’m put out.”",
        "His tone made those words mean that his desperate situation had roused\nhis combativeness, that he would not give up. Her blood beat faster and\nher eyes shone. “You’ll win,” she said, with the quiet confidence which\nstrengthens when it comes from a person whose judgment one has tested and\nfound good. And he believed in her as absolutely as she believed in him.",
        "“I’ve been tempted to resign,” he went on. “If I don’t everybody’ll say\nI’m a failure when the crash comes. But–Madelene, there’s something in\nme that simply won’t let me quit.”",
        "“There is,” replied she; “it’s your father.”",
        "“Anyhow, you are the only public opinion for me.”",
        "“You’ll win,” repeated Madelene. “I’ve been thinking over that whole\nbusiness. If I were you, Arthur\"–she was sitting up so that she could\nlook at him and make her words more impressive–\"I’d dismiss strike and\nfreight rates and the mill, and I’d put my whole mind on Whitney. There’s\na weak spot somewhere in his armor. There always is in a scoundrel’s.”",
        "Arthur reflected. Presently he drew her head down against his; it seemed\nto her that she could feel his brain at work, and soon she knew from the\nchange in the clasp of his arms about her that that keen, quick mind of\nhis was serving him well. “What a joy it is to a woman,” she thought, “to\nknow that she can trust the man she loves–trust him absolutely, always,\nand in every way.” And she fell asleep after awhile, lulled by the\nrhythmic beat of his pulse, so steady, so strong, giving her such a\nrestful sense of security. She did not awaken until he was gently laying\nher in the bed.",
        "“You have found it?” said she, reading the news in the altered expression\nof his face.",
        "“I hope so,” replied he.",
        "She saw that he did not wish to discuss. So she said, “I knew you would,\"\nand went contentedly back into sleep again.",
        "Next day he carefully read the company’s articles of incorporation to\nmake sure that they contained no obstacle to his plan. Then he went to\nScarborough, and together they went to Judge Torrey. Three days later\nthere was a special meeting of the board of directors; the president,\nCharles Whitney, was unable to attend, but his Monday morning mail\ncontained this extract from the minutes:",
        "“Mr. Ranger offered a resolution that an assessment of two thousand\ndollars be at once laid upon each share of the capital stock, the\nproceeds to be expended by the superintendent in betterments. Seconded\nby Mr. Scarborough. Unanimously passed.”",
        "Whitney reread this very carefully. He laid the letter down and stared at\nit. Two thousand dollars a share meant that he, owner of four hundred and\neighty-seven shares, would have to pay in cash nine hundred and\nseventy-four thousand dollars. He ordered his private car attached to the\nnoon express, and at five o’clock he was in Scarborough’s library.",
        "“What is the meaning of this assessment?” he demanded, as\nScarborough entered.",
        "“Mr. Ranger explained the situation to us,” replied Scarborough. “He\nshowed us we had to choose between ruin and a complete reorganization\nwith big improvements and extensions.”",
        "“Lunacy, sheer lunacy!” cried Whitney. “A meeting of the board must be\ncalled and the resolution rescinded.”",
        "Scarborough simply looked at him, a smile in his eyes.",
        "“I never heard of such an outrage! You ask me to pay an assessment of\nnearly a million dollars on stock that is worthless.”",
        "“And,” replied Scarborough, “at the end of the year we expect to levy\nanother assessment of a thousand a share.”",
        "Whitney had been tramping stormily up and down the room. As Scarborough\nuttered those last words he halted. He eyed his tranquil fellow-trustee,\nthen seated himself, and said, with not a trace of his recent fury: “You\nmust know, Scarborough, the mills have no future. I hadn’t the heart to\nsay so before Dr. Hargrave. But I supposed you were reading the signs\nright. The plain truth is, this is no longer a good location for the\nflour industry.”",
        "Scarborough waited before replying; when he did speak his tones were\ndeliberate and suggestive of strong emotion well under control. “True,\"\nsaid he, “not just at present. But Judge Beverwick, your friend and\nsilent partner who sits on the federal bench in this district, is at the\npoint of death. I shall see to it that his successor is a man with a less\nintense prejudice against justice. Thus we may be able to convince some\nof your friends in control of the railways that Saint X is as good a\nplace for mills as any in the country.”",
        "Whitney grunted. His face was inscrutable. He paced the length of the\nroom twice; he stood at the window gazing out at the arbors, at the bees\nbuzzing contentedly, at the flies darting across the sifting sunbeams.\n\"Beautiful place, this,” said he at last; “very homelike. No wonder\nyou’re a happy man.” A pause. “As to the other matter, I’ll see. No\ndoubt I can stop this through the courts, if you push me to it.”",
        "“Not without giving us a chance to explain,” replied Scarborough; “and\nthe higher courts may agree with us that we ought to defend the\nuniversity’s rights against your railway friends and your ’labor’ men\nwhom you sent down here to cause the strike.”",
        "“Rubbish!” said Whitney; and he laughed. “Rubbish!” he repeated. “It’s\nnot a matter either for argument or for anger.” He took his hat, made a\nslight ironic bow, and was gone.",
        "He spent the next morning with Arthur, discussing the main phases of the\nbusiness, with little said by either about the vast new project. They\nlunched together in the car, which was on a siding before the offices,\nready to join the early afternoon express. Arthur was on his guard\nagainst Whitney, but he could not resist the charm of the financier’s\nmanner and conversation. Like all men of force, Whitney had great\nmagnetism, and his conversation was frank to apparent indiscretion, a\nmost plausible presentation of the cynical philosophy of practical life\nas it is lived by men of bold and generous nature.",
        "“That assessment scheme was yours, wasn’t it?” he said, when he and\nArthur had got on terms of intimacy.",
        "“The first suggestion came from me,” admitted Arthur.",
        "“A great stroke,” said Whitney. “You will arrive, young man. I thought it\nwas your doing, because it reminded me of your father. I never knew a\nmore direct man than he, yet he was without an equal at flanking\nmovements. What a pity his mind went before he died! My first impulse was\nto admire his will. But, now that I’ve come to know you, I see that if he\nhad lived to get acquainted with you he’d have made a very; different\ndisposition of the family property. As it is, it’s bound to go to pieces.\nNo board ever managed anything successfully. It’s always a man–one man.\nIn this case it ought to be you. But the time will come–soon,\nprobably–when your view will conflict with that of the majority of the\nboard. Then out you’ll go; and your years of intelligent labor will be\ndestroyed.”",
        "It was plain in Arthur’s face that this common-sense statement of the\ncase produced instant and strong effect. He merely said: “Well, one must\ntake that risk.”",
        "“Not necessarily,” replied Whitney; he was talking in the most careless,\nimpersonal way. “A man of your sort, with the strength and the ability\nyou inherit, and with the power that they give you to play an important\npart in the world, doesn’t let things drift to ruin. I intend,\nultimately, to give my share of the Ranger-Whitney Company to\nTecumseh–I’m telling you this in confidence.”",
        "Arthur glanced quickly at the great financier, suspicion and wonder\nin his eyes.",
        "“But I want it to be a value when I give it,” continued Whitney; “not the\nworse than worthless paper it threatens to become. Scarborough and Dr.\nHargrave are splendid men. No one honors them more highly than I do. But\nthey are not business men. And who will be their successors? Probably men\neven less practical.”",
        "Arthur, keen-witted but young, acute but youthfully ready to attribute\nthe generous motive rather than the sinister, felt that he was getting a\nnew light on Whitney’s character. Perhaps Whitney wasn’t so unworthy,\nafter all. Perhaps, in trying to wreck the business and so get hold of\nit, he had been carrying out a really noble purpose, in the unscrupulous\nway characteristic of the leaders of the world of commerce and finance.\nTo Whitney he said: “I haven’t given any thought to these matters.” With\na good-natured laugh of raillery: “You have kept me too busy.”",
        "Whitney smiled–an admission that yet did not commit him. “When you’ve\nlived a while longer, Arthur,” said he, “you’ll not be so swift and harsh\nin your judgments of men who have to lay the far-sighted plans and have\nto deal with mankind as it is, not as it ought to be. However, by that\ntime the Ranger-Whitney Company will be wiped out. It’s a pity. If only\nthere were some way of getting the control definitely in your\nhands–where your father would have put it if he had lived. It’s a shame\nto permit his life work and his plans for the university to be\ndemolished. In your place I’d not permit it.”",
        "Arthur slowly flushed. Without looking at Whitney, he said: “I don’t see\nhow I could prevent it.”",
        "Whitney studied his flushed face, his lowered eyes, reflected carefully\non the longing note in the voice in which he had made that statement, a\nnote that changed it to a question. “Control could be got only by\nownership,” explained he. “If I were sure you were working with a\ndefinite, practical purpose really to secure the future of the company,\nI’d go heartily into your assessment plan. In fact, I’d–” Whitney was\nfeeling his way. The change in Arthur’s expression, the sudden tightening\nof the lips, warned him that he was about to go too far, that he had\nsowed as much seed as it was wise to sow at that time. He dropped the\nsubject abruptly, saying: “But I’ve got to go up to the bank before train\ntime. I’m glad we’ve had this little talk. Something of value may grow\nout of it. Think it over, and if any new ideas come to you run up to\nChicago and see me.”",
        "Arthur did indeed think it over, every moment of that afternoon; and\nbefore going home he took a long walk alone. He saw that Charles Whitney\nhad proposed a secret partnership, in which he was to play Whitney’s game\nand, in exchange, was to get control of the Ranger-Whitney Company. And\nwhat Whitney had said about the folly of board managements, about the\ninsecurity of his own position, was undeniably true; and the sacrifice of\nthe “smaller morality” for the “larger good” would be merely doing what\nthe biographies of the world’s men of achievement revealed them as doing\nagain and again. Further, once in control, once free to put into action\nthe plans for a truly vast concern, of which he had so often dreamed, he\ncould give Tecumseh a far larger income than it had ever hoped to have\nthrough his father’s gift, and also could himself be rich and powerful.\nTo the men who have operated with success and worldly acclaim under the\ncode of the “larger good,” the men who have aggrandized themselves at the\nexpense of personal honor and the rights of others and the progress of\nthe race, the first, the crucial temptation to sacrifice “smaller\nmorality” and “short-sighted scruples” has always come in some such form\nas it here presented itself to Arthur Ranger. The Napoleons begin as\ndefenders of rational freedom against the insane license of the mob; the\nRockefellers begin as cheapeners of a necessity of life to the straitened\nmillions of their fellow-beings.",
        "If Arthur had been weak, he would have put aside the temptation through\nfear of the consequences of failure. If he had been ignorant, he would\nhave put it aside through superstition. Being neither weak nor ignorant,\nand having a human passion for wealth and power and a willingness to get\nthem if he could do it without sacrifice of self-respect, he sat calmly\ndown with the temptation and listened to it and debated with it. He was\nsilent all through dinner; and after dinner, when he and Madelene were in\ntheir sitting room upstairs, she reading, he sat with his eyes upon her,\nand continued to think.",
        "All at once he gave a curious laugh, went to the writing table and wrote\na few moments. Then he brought the letter to her. “Read that,” said he,\nstanding behind her, his hands on her shoulders and an expression in his\nface that made his resemblance to Hiram startling.",
        "She read:",
        "“MY DEAR MR. WHITNEY: I’ve been ’thinking it over’ as you suggested. I’ve\ndecided to plug along in the old way, between the old landmarks. Let me\nadd that, if you should offer to give your stock to Tecumseh now, I’d\nhave to do my utmost to persuade the trustees not to take it until the\ncompany was once more secure. You see, I feel it is absolutely necessary\nthat you have a large pecuniary interest in the success of our plans.”",
        "When Madelene had read she turned in the chair until she was looking up\nat him. “Well?” she inquired. “What does it mean?”",
        "He told her. “And,” he concluded, “I wish I could be a great man, but I\ncan’t. There’s something small in me that won’t permit it. No doubt\nFranklin was right when he said life was a tunnel and one had to stoop,\nand even occasionally to crawl, in order to get through it successfully.\nNow–if I hadn’t married you–”",
        "“Always blaming me,” she said, tenderly. “But even if you hadn’t\nmarried me, I suspect that sooner or later you’d have decided for being\na large man in a valley rather than a very small imitation man on a\nmountain.” Then, after a moment’s thought, and with sudden radiance:\n\"But a man as big as you are wouldn’t be let stay in the valley, no\nmatter how hard he tried.”",
        "He laughed. “I’ve no objection to the mountain top,” said he. “But I see\nthat, if I get there, it’ll have to be in my own way. Let’s go out and\nmail the letter.”",
        "And they went down the drive together to the post box, and, strolling\nback, sat under the trees in the moonlight until nearly midnight, feeling\nas if they had only just begun life together–and had begun it right.",
        "When Charles Whitney had read the letter he tore it up, saying half-aloud\nand contemptuously, “I was afraid there was too big a streak of fool in\nhim.” Then, with a shrug: “What’s the use of wasting time on that little\ngame–especially as I’d probably have left the university the whole\nbusiness in my will.” He wrote Scarborough, proposing that they delay the\nassessment until he had a chance to look further into the railway\nsituation. “I begin to understand the troubles down there, now that I’ve\ntaken time to think them over. I feel I can guarantee that no assessment\nwill be necessary.”",
        "And when the railways had mysteriously and abruptly ceased to misbehave,\nand the strike had suddenly fizzled out, he offered his stock to the\nuniversity as a gift. “I shall see to it,” he wrote, “that the company is\nnot molested again, but is helped in every way.” Arthur was for holding\noff, but Scarborough said, “No. He will keep his word.” And Scarborough\nwas right in regarding the matter as settled and acceptance of the\nsplendid gift as safe. Whitney had his own code of honesty, of honor. It\nwas not square dealing, but doing exactly what he specifically engaged to\ndo. He would have stolen anything he could–anything he regarded as worth\nhis while. On the other hand, he would have sacrificed nearly all, if not\nall, his fortune, to live up to the letter of his given word. This,\nthough no court would have enforced the agreement he had made, though\nthere was no written record of it, no witness other than himself, the\nother party, and the Almighty–for Charles Whitney believed in an\nAlmighty God and an old-fashioned hell and a Day of Judgment. He\nconducted his religious bookkeeping precisely as he conducted his\nbusiness bookkeeping, and was confident that he could escape hell as he\nhad escaped the penitentiary.",
        "Adelaide did not reach home until the troubles with and through Charles\nWhitney were settled, and Arthur and Dory were deep in carrying out the\nplans to make the mills and factories part of the university and not\nmerely its property. When Scarborough’s urgent cable came, Dory found\nthat all the steamers were full. Adelaide could go with him only by\ntaking a berth in a room with three women in the bottom of the ship.\n\"Impossible accommodations,” thought he, “for so luxurious a person and\nso poor a sailor\"; and he did not tell her that this berth could be had.\n\"You’ll have to wait a week or so,” said he. “As you can’t well stay on\nhere alone, why not accept Mrs. Whitney’s invitation to join her?”",
        "Adelaide disliked Mrs. Whitney, but there seemed to be no alternative.\nMrs. Whitney was at Paris, on the way to America after the wedding and a\nsevere cure at Aix and an aftercure in Switzerland. She had come for the\nfinishing touches of rejuvenation–to get her hair redone and to go\nthrough her biennial agony of having Auguste, beauty specialist to the\nroyalty, nobility and fashion, and demimonde, of three continents, burn\noff her outer skin that nature might replace it with one new and fresh\nand unwrinkled. She was heavily veiled as she and Adelaide traveled down\nto Cherbourg to the steamer. As soon as she got aboard she retired to her\nroom and remained hidden there during the voyage, seen only by her maid,\nher face covered day and night with Auguste’s marvelous skin-coaxing\nmask. Adelaide did not see her again until the morning of the last day,\nwhen she appeared on deck dressed beautifully and youthfully for the\nshore, her skin as fair and smooth as a girl’s, and looking like an elder\nsister of Adelaide’s–at a distance.",
        "She paused in New York; Adelaide hastened to Saint X, though she was\nlooking forward uneasily to her arrival because she feared she would have\nto live at the old Hargrave house in University Avenue. Miss Skeffington\nruled there, and she knew Miss Skeffington–one of those old-fashioned\nold maids whose rigid ideas of morality extend to the ordering of\npersonal habits in minutest detail. Under her military sway everyone had\nto rise for breakfast at seven sharp, had to dine exactly at noon, sup\nwhen the clock struck the half hour after five. Ingress and egress for\nmembers of the family was by the side door only, the front door being\nreserved for company. For company also was the parlor, and for company\nthe front stairs with their brilliant carpet, new, though laid for the\nfirst time nearly a quarter of a century before; for company also was the\nbest room in the house, which ought to have been attractive, but was a\nlittle damp from being shut up so much, and was the cause of many a cold\nto guests. “I simply can’t stand it to live by the striking of clocks!\"\nthought Adelaide. “I must do something! But what?”",
        "Her uneasiness proved unnecessary, however. Dory disappointed his aunt,\nof a new and interestingly difficult spirit to subdue, by taking rooms at\nthe Hendricks Hotel until they should find a place of their own. Mrs.\nRanger asked them to live with her; but Adelaide shrank from putting\nherself in a position where her mother and Arthur could, and her\nsister-in-law undoubtedly would, “know too much about our private\naffairs.” Mrs. Ranger did not insist. She would not admit it to herself,\nbut, while she worshiped Del and thought her even more beautiful than she\nwas, and just about perfection in every way, still Madelene was more\nsatisfactory for daily companionship. Also, Ellen doubted whether two\nsuch positive natures as Madelene’s and Adelaide’s would be harmonious\nunder the same roof. “What’s more,” she reflected, “there may be a\nbaby–babies.”",
        "Within a fortnight of Del’s return, and before she and Dory had got\nquite used to each other again, she fixed on an abode. “Mrs. Dorsey was\nhere this afternoon,” said she, with enthusiasm which, to Dory’s acute\nperceptions, seemed slightly exaggerated, in fact, forced, “and offered\nus her house for a year, just to have somebody in it whom she could trust\nto look after things. You know she’s taking her daughter abroad to\nfinish. It was too good a chance to let pass; so I accepted at once.”",
        "Dory turned away abruptly. With slow deliberation he took a cigarette\nfrom his case, lighted it, watched the smoke drift out at the open\nwindow. She was observing him, though she seemed not to be. And his\nexpression made her just a little afraid. Unlike most men who lead\npurely intellectual lives, he had not the slightest suggestion of\nsexlessness; on the contrary, he seemed as strong, as positive\nphysically, as the look of his forehead and eyes showed him to be\nmentally. And now that he had learned to dress with greater care, out of\ndeference to her, she could find nothing about him to help her in\nprotecting herself by criticising him.",
        "“Do you think, Del,” said he, “that we’ll be able to live in that big\nplace on eighteen hundred a year?”",
        "It wasn’t as easy for him thus to remind her of their limited means as it\ntheoretically should have been. Del was distinctly an expensive-looking\nluxury. That dress of hers, pale green, with hat and everything to match\nor in harmony, was a “simple thing,” but the best dressmaker in the Rue\nde la Paix had spent a great deal of his costly time in producing that\neffect of simplicity. Throughout, she had the cleanness, the freshness,\nthe freedom from affectations which Dory had learned could be got only by\nlarge expenditure. Nor would he have had her any different. He wanted\njust the settings she chose for her fair, fine beauty. The only change he\nwould have asked would have been in the expression of those violet eyes\nof hers when they looked at him.",
        "“You wish I hadn’t done it!” she exclaimed. And if he had not glanced\naway so quickly he would have seen that she was ready to retreat.",
        "“Well, it’s not exactly the start I’d been thinking of,” replied he,\nreluctantly but tentatively.",
        "It is not in human nature to refuse to press an offered advantage. Said\nDel: “Can’t we close up most of the house–use only five or six rooms on\nthe ground floor? And Mrs. Dorsey’s gardener and his helpers will be\nthere. All we have to do is to see that they’ve not neglected the\ngrounds.” She was once more all belief and enthusiasm. “It seemed to me,\ntaking that place was most economical, and so comfortable. Really, Dory,\nI didn’t accept without thinking.”",
        "Dory was debating with himself: To take that house–it was one of those\ntrifles that are anything but trifles–like the slight but crucial motion\nat the crossroads in choosing the road to the left instead of the road to\nthe right. Not to take the house–Del would feel humiliated, reasoned he,\nwould think him unreasonably small, would chafe under the restraint their\nlimited means put upon them, whereas, if he left the question of living\non their income entirely to her good sense, she would not care about the\ndeprivations, would regard them as self-imposed.",
        "“Of course, if you don’t like it, Dory,” she now said, “I suppose Mrs.\nDorsey will let me off. But I’m sure you’d be delighted, once we got\nsettled. The house is so attractive–at least, I think I can make it\nattractive by packing away her showy stuff and rearranging the furniture.\nAnd the grounds–Dory, I don’t see how you can object!”",
        "Dory gave a shrug and a smile. “Well, go ahead. We’ll scramble through\nsomehow.” He shook his head at her in good-humored warning. “Only, please\ndon’t forget what’s coming at the end of your brief year of grandeur.”",
        "Adelaide checked the reply that was all but out. She hastily reflected\nthat it might not be wise to let him know, just then, that Mrs. Dorsey\nhad said they could have the house for two years, probably for three,\nperhaps for five. Instead, she said, “It isn’t the expense, after all,\nthat disturbs you, is it?”",
        "He smiled confession. “No.”",
        "“I know it’s snobbish of me to long for finery so much that I’m even\nwilling to live in another person’s and show off in it,” she sighed.\n\"But–I’m learning gradually.”",
        "He colored. Unconsciously she had put into her tone–and this not for the\nfirst time, by any means–a suggestion that there wasn’t the slightest\ndanger of his wearying of waiting, that she could safely take her time in\ngetting round to sensible ideas and to falling in love with him. His eyes\nhad the look of the veiled amusement that deliberately shows through, as\nhe said, “That’s good. I’ll try to be patient.”",
        "It was her turn to color. But, elbowing instinctive resentment, came\nuneasiness. His love seemed to her of the sort that flowers in the\nromances–the love that endures all, asks nothing, lives forever upon its\nown unfed fire. As is so often the case with women whose charms move men\nto extravagance of speech and emotion, it was a great satisfaction to\nher, to her vanity, to feel that she had inspired this wonderful immortal\nflame; obviously, to feed such a flame by giving love for love would\nreduce it to the commonplace. All women start with these exaggerated\nnotions of the value of being loved; few of them ever realize and rouse\nthemselves, or are aroused, from their vanity to the truth that the value\nis all the other way. Adelaide was only the natural woman in blindly\nfancying that Dory was the one to be commiserated, in not seeing that she\nherself was a greater loser than he, that to return his love would not be\na concession but an acquisition. Most men are content to love, to compel\nwomen to receive their love; they prefer the passive, the receptive\nattitude in the woman, and are even bored by being actively loved in\nreturn; for love is exacting, and the male is impatient of exaction.\nAdelaide did not understand just this broad but subtle difference between\nDory and “most men\"–that he would feel that he was violating her were he\nto sweep her away in the arms of his impetuous released passion, as he\nknew he could. He felt that such a yielding was, after all, like the\ninert obedience of the leaf to the storm wind–that what he could compel,\nwhat women call love, would be as utterly without substance as an image\nin a mirror, indeed, would be a mere passive reflection of his own\nlove–all most men want, but worthless to him.",
        "Could it be that Dory’s love had become–no, not less, but less ardent?\nShe saw that he was deep in thought–about her, she assumed, with an\nunconscious vanity which would have excited the mockery of many who have\nmore vanity than had she, and perhaps with less excuse. In fact, he was\nnot thinking of her; having the ability to turn his mind completely where\nhe willed–the quality of all strong men, and the one that often makes\nthe weak-willed think them hard–he was revolving the vast and inspiring\nplans Arthur and he had just got into practical form–plans for new\nfactories and mills such as a university, professing to be in the\nforefront of progress need not be ashamed to own or to offer to its\nstudents as workshops. All that science has bestowed in the way of making\nlabor and its surroundings clean and comfortable, healthful and\nattractive, was to be provided; all that the ignorance and the\nshortsighted greediness of employers, bent only on immediate profits and\nkeeping their philanthropy for the smug penuriousness and degrading\nstupidity of charity, deny to their own self-respect and to justice for\ntheir brothers in their power. Arthur and he had wrought it all out, had\ndiscovered as a crowning vindication that the result would be profitable\nin dollars, that their sane and shrewd utopianism would produce larger\ndividends than the sordid and slovenly methods of their competitors. “It\nis always so. Science is always economical as well as enlightened and\nhumane,” Dory was thinking when Adelaide’s voice broke into his reverie.",
        "“You are right, Dory,” said she. “And I shall give up the house. I’ll go\nto see Mrs. Dorsey now.”",
        "“The house?–What–Oh, yes–well–no–What made you change?”",
        "She did not know the real reason–that, studying his face, the curve and\nset of his head, the strength of the personality which she was too apt to\ntake for granted most of the time because he was simple and free from\npretense, she had been reminded that he was not a man to be trifled with,\nthat she would better bestir herself and give more thought and attention\nto what was going on in that superbly shaped head of his–about her,\nabout her and him. “Oh, I don’t just know,” replied she, quite honestly.\n\"It seems to me now that there’ll be too much fuss and care and–sham.\nAnd I intend to interest myself in your work. You’ve hardly spoken of\nit since I got back.”",
        "“There’s been so little time–”",
        "“You mean,” she interrupted, “I’ve been so busy unpacking my silly\ndresses and hats and making and receiving silly calls.”",
        "“Now you’re in one of your penitential moods,” laughed Dory. “And\nto-morrow you’ll wish you hadn’t changed about the house. No–that’s\nsettled. We’ll take it, and see what the consequences are.”",
        "Adelaide brightened. His tone was his old self, and she did want that\nhouse so intensely! “I can be useful to Dory there; I can do so much on\nthe social side of the university life. He doesn’t appreciate the value\nof those things in advancing a career. He thinks a career is made by work\nonly. But I’ll show him! I’ll make his house the center of the\nuniversity!”",
        "Mrs. Dorsey had “Villa d’Orsay” carved on the stone pillars of her great\nwrought-iron gates, to remind the populace that, while her late\nfather-in-law, “Buck” Dorsey, was the plainest of butchers and meat\npackers, his ancestry was of the proudest. With the rise of its “upper\nclass” Saint X had gone in diligently for genealogy, had developed\nreverence for “tradition” and “blood,” had established a Society of\nFamily Histories, a chapter of the Colonial Dames, another of Daughters\nof the Revolution, and was in a fair way to rival the seaboard cities in\ndevotion to the imported follies and frauds of “family.” Dory at first\nindulged his sense of humor upon their Dorsey or d’Orsay finery. It\nseemed to him they must choose between making a joke of it and having it\nmake a joke of them. But he desisted when he saw that it grated on Del\nfor him to speak of her and himself as “caretakers for the rich.” And\npresently his disposition to levity died of itself. It sobered and\ndisheartened and, yes, disgusted him as he was forced to admit to himself\nthe reality of her delight in receiving people in the great drawing room,\nof her content in the vacuous, time-wasting habits, of her sense of\nsuperiority through having at her command a troop of servants–Mrs.\nDorsey’s servants! He himself disliked servants about, hated to abet a\nfellow-being in looking on himself or herself as an inferior; and he\nregarded as one of the basest, as well as subtlest poisons of\nsnobbishness, the habit of telling others to do for one the menial,\npersonal things which can be done with dignity only by oneself. Once, in\nParis–after Besançon–Janet spoke of some of her aristocratic\nacquaintances on the other side as “acting as if they had always been\nused to everything; so different from even the best people at home.” Dory\nremembered how Adelaide promptly took her up, gave instance after\ninstance in proof that European aristocrats were in fact as vulgar in\ntheir satisfaction in servility as were the newest of the newly\naristocratic at home, but simply had a different way of showing it. “A\nmore vulgar way,” she said, Janet unable to refute her. “Yes, far more\nvulgar, Jen, because deliberately concealed; just as vanity that swells\nin secret is far worse than frank, childish conceit.”",
        "And now–These vanities of hers, sprung from the old roots which in Paris\nshe had been eager to kill and he was hoping were about dead, sprung in\nvigor and spreading in weedy exuberance! He often looked at her in sad\nwonder when she was unconscious of it. “What is the matter?” he would\nrepeat. “She is farther away than in Paris, where the temptation to this\nsort of nonsense was at least plausible.” And he grew silent with her and\nshut himself in alone during the evening hours which he could not spend\nat the university. She knew why, knew also that he was right, ceased to\nbore herself and irritate him with attempts to make the Villa d’Orsay the\nsocial center of the university. But she continued to waste her days in\nthe inane pastimes of Saint X’s fashionable world, though ashamed of\nherself and disgusted with her mode of life. For snobbishness is\nessentially a provincial vice, due full as much to narrowness as to\nignorance; and, thus, it is most potent in the small “set” in the small\ntown. In the city even the narrowest are compelled to at least an\noccasional glimpse of wider horizons; but in the small town only the\nvigilant and resolute ever get so much as a momentary point of view. She\ntold herself, in angry attempt at self-excuse, that he ought to take her\nin hand, ought to snatch her away from that which she had not the courage\nto give up of herself. Yet she knew she would hate him should he try to\ndo it. She assumed that was the reason he didn’t; and it was part of the\nreason, but a lesser part than his unacknowledged, furtive fear of what\nhe might discover as to his own feelings toward her, were there just then\na casting up and balancing of their confused accounts with each other.",
        "Both were relieved, as at a crisis postponed, when it became necessary\nfor him to go abroad again immediately. “I don’t see how you can\nleave,” said he, thus intentionally sparing her a painful effort in\nsaying what at once came into the mind of each.",
        "“We could cable Mrs. Dorsey,” she suggested lamely. She was at the Louis\nQuinze desk in the Louis Quinze sitting room, and her old gold negligee\nmatched in charmingly, and the whole setting brought out the sheen,\nfaintly golden, over her clear skin, the peculiarly fresh and intense\nshade of her violet eyes, the suggestion of gold in her thick hair, with\nits wan, autumnal coloring, such as one sees in a field of dead ripe\ngrain. She was doing her monthly accounts, and the showing was not\npleasant. She was a good housekeeper, a surprisingly good manager; but\nshe did too much entertaining for their income.",
        "Dory was too much occupied with the picture she made as she sat there to\nreply immediately. “I doubt,” he finally replied, “if she could arrange\nby cable for some one else whom she would trust with her treasures. No, I\nguess you’ll have to stay.”",
        "“I wish I hadn’t taken this place!” she exclaimed. It was the first\nconfession of what her real, her sane and intelligent self had been\nproclaiming loudly since the first flush of interest and pleasure in\nher “borrowed plumage” had receded. “Why do you let me make a fool\nof myself?”",
        "“No use going into that,” replied he, on guard not to take too seriously\nthis belated penitence. He was used to Del’s fits of remorse, so used to\nthem that he thought them less valuable than they really were, or might\nhave been had he understood her better–or, not bothered about trying to\nunderstand her. “I shan’t be away long, I imagine,” he went on, “and I’ll\nhave to rush round from England to France, to Germany, to Austria, to\nSwitzerland. All that would be exhausting for you, and only a little of\nthe time pleasant.”",
        "His words sounded to her like a tolling over the grave of that former\nfriendship and comradeship of theirs. “I really believe you’ll be glad to\nget away alone,” cried she, lips smiling raillery, eyes full of tears.",
        "“Do you think so?” said Dory, as if tossing back her jest. But both knew\nthe truth, and each knew that the other knew it. He was as glad to escape\nfrom those surroundings as she to be relieved of a presence which edged\non her other-self to scoff and rail and sneer at her. It had become\nbitterness to him to enter the gates of the Villa d’Orsay. His nerves\nwere so wrought up that to look about the magnificent but too\npalace-like, too hotel-like rooms was to struggle with a longing to run\namuck and pause not until he had reduced the splendor to smithereens. And\nin that injustice of chronic self-excuse which characterizes all human\nbeings who do not live by intelligently formed and intelligently executed\nplan, she was now trying to soothe herself with blaming him for her low\nspirits; in fact, they were wholly the result of her consciously unworthy\nmode of life, and of an incessant internal warfare, exhausting and\ndepressing. Also, the day would surely come when he would ask how she was\ncontriving to keep up such imposing appearances on their eighteen hundred\na year; and then she would have to choose between directly deceiving him\nand telling him that she had broken–no, not broken, that was too\nharsh–rather, had not yet fulfilled the promise to give up the income\nher father left her.",
        "After a constrained silence, “I really don’t need anyone to stop here\nwith me,” she said to him, as if she had been thinking of it and not of\nthe situation between them, “but I’ll get Stella Wilmot and her brother.”",
        "“Arden?” said Dory, doubtfully. “I know he’s all right in some ways, and\nhe has stopped drinking since he got the place at the bank. But–”",
        "“If we show we have confidence in him,” replied Adelaide, “I think it\nwill help him.”",
        "“Very well,” said Dory. “Besides, it isn’t easy to find people of the\nsort you’d be willing to have, who can leave home and come here.”",
        "Adelaide colored as she smiled. “Perhaps that was my reason, rather\nthan helping him,” she said.",
        "Dory flushed. “Oh, I didn’t mean to insinuate that!” he protested, and\nchecked himself from saying more. In their mood each would search the\nother’s every word for a hidden thrust, and would find it.",
        "The constraint between them, which thus definitely entered the stage of\ndeep cleavage where there had never been a joining, persisted until the\nparting. Since the wedding he had kissed her but once–on her arrival\nfrom Europe. Then, there was much bustle of greeting from others, and\nneither had had chance to be self-conscious. When they were at the\nstation for his departure, it so happened that no one had come with them.\nAs the porter warned them that the train was about to move, they shook\nhands and hesitated, blushing and conscious of themselves and of\nspectators, “Good-by,” stammered Dory, with a dash at her cheek.",
        "“Good-by,” she murmured, making her effort at the same instant.",
        "The result was a confusion of features and hat brims that threw them\ninto a panic, then into laughter, and so made the second attempt easy\nand successful. It was a real meeting of the lips. His arm went round\nher, her hand pressed tenderly on his shoulder, and he felt a trembling\nin her form, saw a sudden gleam of light leap into and from her eyes.\nAnd all in that flash the secret of his mistake in managing his love\naffair burst upon him.",
        "“Good-by, Dory–dear,” she was murmuring, a note in her voice like the\nshy answer of a hermit thrush to the call of her mate.",
        "“All aboard!” shouted the conductor, and the wheels began to move.",
        "“Good-by–good-by,” he stammered, his blood surging through his head.",
        "It came into her mind to say, “I care for you more than I knew.” But his\nfriend the conductor was thrusting him up the steps of the car. “I wish I\nhad said it,” thought she, watching the train disappear round the curve.\n\"I’ll write it.”",
        "But she did not. When the time came to write, that idea somehow would not\nfit in with the other things she was setting down. “I think I do care for\nhim–as a friend,” she decided. “If he had only compelled me to find out\nthe state of my own mind! What a strange man! I don’t see how he can love\nme, for he knows me as I am. Perhaps he really doesn’t; sometimes I think\nhe couldn’t care for a woman as a woman wants to be cared for.” Then as\nhis face as she had last seen it rose before her, and her lips once more\ntingled, “Oh, yes, he does care! And without his love how wretched I’d\nbe! What a greedy I am–wanting his love and taking it, and giving\nnothing in return.” That last more than half-sincere, though she, like\nnot a few of her sisters in the “Woman’s Paradise,” otherwise known as\nthe United States of America, had been spoiled into greatly exaggerating\nthe value of her graciously condescending to let herself be loved.",
        "And she was lonely without him. If he could have come back at the end of\na week or a month, he would have been received with an ardor that would\nhave melted every real obstacle between them. Also, it would have\ndissipated the far more obstructive imaginary obstacles from their\ninfection with the latter-day vice of psychologizing about matters which\nlie in the realm of physiology, not of psychology. But he did not come;\nand absence, like bereavement, has its climax, after which the thing\nthat was begins to be as if it had not been.",
        "He was gone; and that impetuous parting caress of his had roused in her\nan impulse that would never again sleep, would pace its cage restlessly,\neager for the chance to burst forth. And he had roused it when he would\nnot be there to make its imperious clamor personal to himself.",
        "As Estelle was at her shop all day, and not a few of the evenings, Del\nbegan to see much of Henrietta Hastings. Grandfather Fuller was now dead\nand forgotten in the mausoleum into which he had put one-fifth of his\nfortune, to the great discontent of the heirs. Henrietta’s income had\nexpanded from four thousand a year to twenty; and she spent her days in\nthinking of and talking of the careers to which she could help her\nhusband if he would only shake off the lethargy which seized him the year\nafter his marriage to a Fuller heiress. But Hastings would not; he was\nhappy in his books and in his local repute for knowing everything there\nwas to be known. Month by month he grew fatter and lazier and slower of\nspeech. Henrietta pretended to be irritated against him, and the town had\nthe habit of saying that “If Hastings had some of his wife’s ’get up’ he\nwouldn’t be making her unhappy but would be winning a big name for\nhimself.” In fact, had Hastings tried to bestir himself at something\ndefinite in the way of action, Henrietta would have been really disturbed\ninstead of simply pretending to be. She had a good mind, a keen wit that\nhad become bitter with unlicensed indulgence; but she was as indolent and\npurposeless as her husband. All her energy went in talk about doing\nsomething, and every day she had a new scheme, with yesterday’s forgotten\nor disdained.",
        "Adelaide pretended to herself to regard Henrietta as an energetic and\nstimulating person, though she knew that Henrietta’s energy, like her\nown, like that of most women of the sheltered, servant-attended class,\nwas a mere blowing off of steam by an active but valveless engine of a\nmind. But this pretense enabled her to justify herself for long mornings\nand afternoons at the Country Club with Henrietta. They talked of\nactivity, of accomplishing this and that and the other; they read\nfitfully at serious books; they planned novels and plays; they separated\neach day with a comfortable feeling that they had been usefully employed.\nAnd each did learn much from the other; but, as each confirmed the other\nin the habitual mental vices of the women, and of an increasing number of\nthe men, of our quite comfortable classes, the net result of their\nintercourse was pitifully poor, the poorer for their fond delusions that\nthey were improving themselves. They laughed at the “culture craze\"\nwhich, raging westward, had seized upon all the women of Saint X with\nincomes, or with husbands or fathers to support them in idleness–the\ncraze for thinking, reading, and talking cloudily or muddily on cloudy or\nmuddy subjects. Henrietta and Adelaide jeered; yet they were themselves\nthe victims of another, and, if possible, more poisonous, bacillus of the\nsame sluggard family.",
        "One morning Adelaide, in graceful ease in her favorite nook in the small\nnorthwest portico of the club house, was reading a most imposingly bound\nand illustrated work on Italian architecture written by a smatterer for\nsmatterers. She did a great deal of reading in this direction because it\nwas also the direction of her talent, and so she could make herself think\nshe was getting ready to join in Dory’s work when he returned. She heard\nfootsteps just round the corner, and looked up. She and Ross Whitney were\nface to face.",
        "There was no chance for evasion. He, with heightened color, lifted his\nhat; she, with a nonchalance that made her proud of herself, smiled and\nstretched out her hand. “Hello, Ross,” said she, languidly friendly.\n\"When did you come to town?” And she congratulated herself that her\nhair had gone up so well that morning and that her dress was one of her\nmost becoming–from Paris, from Paquin–a year old, it is true, but\nlater than the latest in Saint X and fashionable even for Sherry’s at\nlunch time.",
        "Ross, the expert, got himself together and made cover without any\nseeming of scramble; but his not quite easy eyes betrayed him to her.\n\"About two hours ago,” replied he.",
        "“Is Theresa with you?” She gazed tranquilly at him as she fired this\ncenter shot. She admired the coolness with which he received it.",
        "“No; she’s up at her father’s place–on the lake shore,” he answered. He,\ntoo, was looking particularly well, fresh yet experienced, and in dress a\nmodel, with his serge of a strange, beautiful shade of blue, his red tie\nand socks, and his ruby-set cuff-links. “Mr. Howland is ill, and she’s\nnursing him. I’m taking a few days off–came down to try to sell father’s\nplace for him.”",
        "“You’re going to sell Point Helen?” said Adelaide, politely regretful.\n\"Then I suppose we shan’t see your people here any more. Your mother’ll\nno doubt spend most of her time abroad, now that Janet is married there.”",
        "Ross did not answer immediately. He was looking into the distance, his\nexpression melancholy. His abstraction gave Adelaide a chance to verify\nthe impression she had got from a swift but femininely penetrating first\nglance. Yes, he did look older; no, not exactly older–sad, rather.\nEvidently he was unhappy, distinctly unhappy. And as handsome and as\ntasteful as ever–the band of his straw hat, the flower in his\nbuttonhole, his tie, his socks–all in harmony; no ostentation, just the\nunerring, quiet taste of a gentleman. What a satisfactory person to look\nat! To be sure, his character–However, character has nothing to do with\nthe eye-pleasures, and they are undeniably agreeable. Then there were his\nmanners, and his mind–such a man of the world! Of course he wasn’t for\none instant to be compared with Dory–who was? Still, it was a pity that\nDory had a prejudice against showing all that he really was, a pity he\nhad to be known to be appreciated–that is, appreciated by the “right\nsort” of people. Of course, the observant few could see him in his face,\nwhich was certainly distinguished–yes, far more distinguished than\nRoss’s, if not so regularly handsome.",
        "“I’ve been looking over the old place,” Ross was saying, “and I’ve\ndecided to ask father to keep it. Theresa doesn’t like it here; but I do,\nand I can’t bring myself to cut the last cords. As I wandered over the\nplace I found myself getting so sad and sentimental that I hurried away\nto escape a fit of the blues.”",
        "“We’re accustomed to that sort of talk,” said Adelaide with a mocking\nsmile in her delightful eyes. “People who used to live here and come back\non business occasionally always tell us how much more beautiful Saint X\nis than any other place on earth. But they take the first train for\nChicago or Cincinnati or anywhere at all.”",
        "“So you find it dull here?”",
        "“I?” Adelaide shrugged her charming shoulders slightly. “Not so very. My\nlife is here–the people, the things I’m used to. I’ve a sense of peace\nthat I don’t have anywhere else.” She gazed dreamily away. “And peace is\nthe greatest asset.”",
        "“The greatest asset,” repeated Ross absently. “You are to be envied.”",
        "“I think so,” assented she, a curious undertone of defiance in her\nvoice. She had a paniclike impulse to begin to talk of Dory; but, though\nshe cast about diligently, she could find no way of introducing him that\nwould not have seemed awkward–pointed and provincially prudish.",
        "“What are you reading?” he asked presently.",
        "She turned the book so that he could see the title. His eyes wandered\nfrom it to linger on her slender white fingers–on the one where a plain\nband of gold shone eloquently. It fascinated and angered him; and she saw\nit, and was delighted. Her voice had a note of triumph in it as she said,\nputting the book on the table beside her, “Foolish, isn’t it, to be\nreading how to build beautiful houses\"–she was going to say, “when one\nwill probably never build any house at all.” She bethought her that this\nmight sound like a sigh over Dory’s poverty and over the might-have-been.\nSo she ended, “when the weather is so deliciously lazy.”",
        "“I know the chap who wrote it,” said Ross, “Clever–really unusual\ntalent. But the fashionable women took him up, made him a toady and a\nsnob, like the rest of the men of their set. How that sort of thing eats\nout manhood and womanhood!”",
        "Just what Dory often said! “My husband says,” she answered, “that\nwhenever the world has got a fair start toward becoming civilized, along\nhave come wealth and luxury to smother and kill. It’s very interesting to\nread history from that standpoint, instead of taking the usual view–that\nluxury produces the arts and graces.”",
        "“Dory is a remarkable man,” said Ross with enthusiasm. “He’s amazingly\nmodest; but there are some men so big that they can’t hide, no matter how\nhard they try. He’s one of them.”",
        "Adelaide was in a glow, so happy did this sincere and just tribute make\nher, so relieved did she feel. She was talking to one of Dory’s friends\nand admirers, not with an old sweetheart of hers about whom her heart,\nperhaps, might be–well, a little sore, and from whom radiated a\nrespectful, and therefore subtle, suggestion that the past was very\nmuch the present for him. She hastened to expand upon Dory, upon his\nwork; and, as she talked of the university, she found she had a pride\nin it, and an interest, and a knowledge, too, which astonished her. And\nRoss listened, made appreciative comments. And so, on and on. When\nHenrietta came they were laughing and talking like the best of old\nfriends; and at Ross’s invitation the three lunched at the club and\nspent the afternoon together.",
        "“I think marriage has improved Ross,” said Henrietta, as she and Adelaide\nwere driving home together after tea–tea with Ross.",
        "“Theresa is a very sweet woman,” said Adelaide dutifully.",
        "“Oh, I don’t mean that–any more than you do,” replied Henrietta. “I mean\nmarriage has chastened him–the only way it ever improves anybody.”",
        "“No doubt he and Theresa are happy together,” said Adelaide, clinging to\nher pretense with a persistence that might have given her interesting and\nvaluable light upon herself had she noted it.",
        "“Happy?” Henrietta Hastings laughed. “Only stupid people are happy, my\ndear. Theresa may be happy, but not Ross. He’s far too intelligent. And\nTheresa isn’t capable of giving him even those moments of happiness that\nrepay the intelligent for their routine of the other sort of thing.”",
        "“Marriage doesn’t mean much in a man’s life,” said Adelaide. “He has his\nbusiness or profession. He is married only part of each day, and that the\nleast important part to him.”",
        "“Yes,” replied Henrietta, “marriage is for a man simply a peg in his\nshoe–in place or, as with Ross Whitney, out of place. One look at his\nface was enough to show me that he was limping and aching and groaning.”",
        "Adelaide found this pleasantry amusing far beyond its merits. “You can’t\ntell,” said she. “Theresa doesn’t seem the same to him that she does\nto–to us.”",
        "“Worse,” replied Henrietta, “worse. It’s fortunate they’re rich. If the\nbetter class of people hadn’t the money that enables them to put buffers\nround themselves, wife-beating wouldn’t be confined to the slums. Think\nof life in one of two small rooms with a Theresa Howland!”",
        "Adelaide had fallen, as far as could one of her generous and tolerant\ndisposition, into Henrietta’s most infectious habit of girding at\neveryone humorously–the favorite pastime of the idle who are profoundly\ndiscontented with themselves. By the time Mrs. Hastings left her at the\nlofty imported gates of Villa d’Orsay, they had done the subject of\nTheresa full justice, and Adelaide entered the house with that sense of\nself-contempt which cannot but come to any decent person after meting out\nuntempered justice to a fellow-mortal. This did not last, however; the\npleasure in the realization that Ross did not care for Theresa and did\ncare for herself was too keen. As the feminine test of feminine success\nis the impression a woman makes upon men, Adelaide would have been\nneither human nor woman had she not been pleased with Ross’s discreet and\nsincerely respectful, and by no means deliberate or designing disclosure.\nIt was not the proof of her power to charm the male that had made her\nindignant at herself. “How weak we women are!” she said to herself,\ntrying to assume a penitence she could not make herself feel. “We really\nought to be locked away in harems. No doubt Dory trusts me\nabsolutely–that’s because other women are no temptation to him–that is,\nI suppose they aren’t. If he were different, he’d be afraid I had his\nweakness–we all think everybody has at least a touch of our infirmities.\nOf course I can be trusted; I’ve sense enough not to have my head turned\nby what may have been a mere clever attempt to smooth over the past.\"\nThen she remembered Ross’s look at her hand, at her wedding ring, and\nHenrietta’s confirmation of her own diagnosis. “But why should thatinterest me,” she thought, impatient with herself for lingering where\nher ideal of self-respect forbade. “I don’t love Ross Whitney. He pleases\nme, as he pleases any woman he wishes to make an agreeable impression\nupon. And, naturally, I like to know that he really did care for me and\nis ashamed and repentant of the baseness that made him act as he did. But\nbeyond that, I care nothing about him–nothing. I may not care for Dory\nexactly as I should; but at least knowing him has made it impossible for\nme to go back to the Ross sort of man.”",
        "That seemed clear and satisfactory. But, strangely, her mind jumped to\nthe somewhat unexpected conclusion, “And I’ll not see him again.”",
        "She wrote Dory that night a long, long letter, the nearest to a love\nletter she had ever written him. She brought Ross in quite casually;\nyet–What is the mystery of the telltale penumbra round the written word?\nWhy was it that Dory, in far-away Vienna, with the memory of her strong\nand of the Villa d’Orsay dim, reading the letter for the first time,\nthought it the best he had ever got from her; and the next morning,\nreading it again, could think of nothing but Ross, and what Adelaide had\nreally thought about him deep down in that dark well of the heart where\nwe rarely let even our own eyes look intently?",
        "Ross had intended to dine at the club; but Mrs. Hastings’s trap was\nhardly clear of the grounds when he, to be free to think uninterruptedly,\nset out through the woods for Point Helen.",
        "Even had he had interests more absorbing than pastimes, display, and\nmoney-making by the “brace” game of “high finance” with its small risks\nof losing and smaller risks of being caught, even if he had been married\nto a less positive and incessant irritant than Theresa was to him, he\nwould still not have forgotten Adelaide. Forgetfulness comes with the\nfinished episode, never with the unfinished. In the circumstances, there\ncould be but one effect from seeing her again. His regrets blazed up into\nfierce remorse, became the reckless raging of a passion to which\nobstacles and difficulties are as fuel to fire.",
        "Theresa, once the matter of husband-getting was safely settled, had no\nrestraint of prudence upon her self-complacence. She “let herself go\"\ncompletely, with results upon her character, her mind, and her personal\nappearance that were depressing enough to the casual beholder, but\nappalling to those who were in her intimacy of the home. Ross watched her\ndeteriorate in gloomy and unreproving silence. She got herself together\nsufficiently for as good public appearance as a person of her wealth and\nposition needed to make, he reasoned; what did it matter how she looked\nand talked at home where, after all, the only person she could hope to\nplease was herself? He held aloof, drawn from his aloofness occasionally\nby her whim to indulge herself in what she regarded as proofs of his\nlove. Her pouting, her whimpering, her abject but meaningless\nself-depreciation, her tears, were potent, not for the flattering reason\nshe assigned, but because he, out of pity for her and self-reproach, and\ndread of her developing her mother’s weakness, would lash himself into\nthe small show of tenderness sufficient to satisfy her.",
        "And now, steeped in the gall of as bitter a draught as experience forces\nfolly to drink anew each day to the dregs–the realization that, though\nthe man marries the money only, he lives with the wife only–Ross had met\nAdelaide again. “I’ll go to Chicago in the morning,” was his conclusion.\n\"I’ll do the honorable thing\"–he sneered at himself–\"since trying the\nother would only result in her laughing at me and in my being still more\nmiserable.”",
        "But when morning came he was critical of the clothes his valet offered\nhim, spent an hour in getting himself groomed for public appearance, then\nappeared at the Country Club for breakfast instead of driving to the\nstation. And after breakfast, he put off his departure “until to-morrow\nor next day,” and went to see Mr. and Mrs. Hastings. And what more\nnatural then than that Henrietta should take him to the Villa d’Orsay “to\nshow you how charmingly Del has installed herself.” “And perhaps,” said\nHenrietta, “she and Arden Wilmot will go for a drive. He has quit the\nbank because they objected to his resting two hours in the middle of the\nday.” What more natural than that Adelaide should alter her resolution\nunder the compulsion of circumstance, should spend the entire morning in\nthe gardens, she with Ross, Henrietta with Arden? Finally, to avoid\nstrain upon her simple domestic arrangements in that period of\nretrenchment, what more natural than falling in with Ross’s proposal of\nlunch at Indian Mound? And who ever came back in a hurry from Indian\nMound, with its quaint vast earthworks, its ugly, incredibly ancient\npotteries and flint instruments that could be uncovered anywhere with the\npoint of a cane or parasol; its superb panorama, bounded by the far blue\nhills where, in days that were ancient when history began, fires were\nlighted by sentinels to signal the enemy’s approach to a people whose\nvery dust, whose very name has perished? It was six o’clock before they\nbegan the return drive; at seven they were passing the Country Club, and,\nof course, they dined there and joined in the little informal dance\nafterwards; and later, supper and cooling drinks in a corner of the\nveranda, with the moon streaming upon them and the enchanted breath of\nthe forest enchaining the senses.",
        "What a day! How obligingly all unpleasant thoughts fled! How high and\nbright rose the mountains all round the horizon of the present, shutting\nout yesterday and to-morrow! “This has been the happy day of my life,\"\nsaid Ross as they lingered behind the other two on the way to the last\n’bus for the town. “The happiest\"–in a lower tone–\"thus far.”",
        "And Del was sparkling assent, encouragement even; and her eyes were\ngleaming defiantly at the only-too-plainly-to-be-read faces of the few\nhilltop people still left at the club house. “Surely a woman has the\nright to enjoy herself innocently in the twentieth century,” she was\nsaying to herself. “Dory wouldn’t want me to sit moping alone. I am\nyoung; I’ll have enough of that after I’m old–one is old so much longer\nthan young.” And she looked up at Ross, and very handsome he was in that\nsoft moonlight, his high-blazing passion glorifying his features. “I,\ntoo, have been happy,” she said to him. Then, with a vain effort to seem\nand to believe herself at ease, “I wish Dory could have been along.”",
        "But Ross was not abashed by the exorcism of that name; her bringing it in\nwas too strained, would have been amusing if passion were not devoid of\nthe sense of humor. “She does care for me!” he was thinking dizzily.\n\"And I can’t live without her–and won’t!”",
        "His mother had been writing him her discoveries that his father, in\nwretched health and goaded by physical torment to furious play at the\ngreen tables of “high finance,” was losing steadily, swiftly, heavily.\nBut Ross read her letters as indifferently as he read Theresa’s appeals\nto him to come to Windrift. It took a telegram–\"Matters much worse than\nI thought. You must be here to talk with him before he begins business\nto-morrow\"–to shock him into the realization that he had been imperiling\nthe future he was dreaming of and planning–his and Del’s future.",
        "On the way to the train he stopped at the Villa d’Orsay, saw her and\nHenrietta at the far end of Mrs. Dorsey’s famed white-and-gold garden.\nHenrietta was in the pavilion reading. A few yards away Adelaide, head\nbent and blue sunshade slowly turning as it rested on her shoulder, was\nstrolling round the great flower-rimmed, lily-strewn outer basin of Mrs.\nDorsey’s famed fountain, the school of crimson fish, like a streak of\nfire in the water, following her. When she saw him coming toward them in\ntraveling suit, instead of the white serge he always wore on such days\nas was that, she knew he was going away–a fortunate forewarning, for\nshe thus had time to force a less telltale expression before he\nannounced the reason for his call. “But,” he added, “I’ll be back in a\nfew days–a very few.”",
        "“Oh!” was all Del said; but her tone of relief, her sudden brightening,\nwere more significant than any words could have been.",
        "Henrietta now joined them. “You take the afternoon express?” said she.",
        "Ross could not conceal how severe a test of his civility this\ninterruption was. “Yes,” said he. “My trap is in front of the house.”",
        "There he colored before Henrietta’s expression, a mingling of amusement,\nindignation, and contempt, a caustic comment upon his disregard of the\neffect of such indiscretion upon a Saint X young married woman’s\nreputation. “Then,” said she, looking straight and significantly at him,\n\"you’ll be able to drop me at my house on the way.”",
        "“Certainly,” was his prompt assent. When Saint X’s morality police should\nsee him leaving the grounds with her, they would be silenced as to this\nparticular occurrence at least. After a few minutes of awkward\ncommonplaces, he and Henrietta went up the lawns, leaving Del there. At\nthe last point from which the end of the garden could be seen, he\ndropped behind, turned, saw her in exactly the same position, the\nfountain and the water lilies before her, the center and climax of those\nstretches of white-and-gold blossoms. The sunshade rested lightly upon\nher shoulder, and its azure concave made a harmonious background for her\nsmall, graceful head with the airily plumed hat set so becomingly upon\nthose waves of dead-gold hair. He waved to her; but she made no sign of\nhaving seen.",
        "When Henrietta returned, Adelaide had resumed her reverie and her slow\nmarch round the fountain. Henrietta watched with a quizzical expression\nfor some time before saying: “If I hadn’t discouraged him, I believe he’d\nhave blurted it all out to me–all he came to say to you.”",
        "Del was still absent-minded as she answered: “It’s too absurd. People are\nso censorious, so low-minded.”",
        "“They are,” rejoined Mrs. Hastings. “And, I’m sorry to say, as a rule\nthey’re right.”",
        "The curve of Del’s delicate eyebrows and of her lips straightened.",
        "“All the trouble comes through our having nothing to do,” pursued\nHenrietta, disregarding those signs that her “meddling” was unwelcome.\n\"The idle women! We ought to be busy at something useful–you and I and\nthe rest of ’em. Then we’d not be tempted to kill time doing things that\ncause gossip, and may cause scandal.” Seeing that Adelaide was about to\nmake some curt retort, she added: “Now, don’t pretend, Del. You know,\nyourself, that they’re always getting into mischief and getting the men\ninto mischief.”",
        "“Don’t you ever feel, Henrietta, that we’re simply straws in the\nstrong wind?”",
        "“Fate sometimes does force mischief on men and women,” was Henrietta’s\nretort, “and it ceases to be mischief–becomes something else, I’m not\nsure just what. But usually fate has nothing to do with the matter. It’s\nwe ourselves that course for mischief, like a dog for rabbits.”",
        "Del, in sudden disdain of evasion, faced her with, “Well, Henrietta,\nwhat of it?”",
        "Mrs. Hastings elevated and lowered her shoulders. “Simply that you’re\nseeing too much of Ross–too much for his good, if not for your own.”",
        "Del’s sunshade was revolving impatiently.",
        "“It’s as plain as black on white,” continued Mrs. Hastings, “that he’s\nmadly in love with you–in love as only an experienced man can be with an\nexperienced and developed woman.”",
        "“Well, what of it?” Del’s tone was hostile, defiant.",
        "“You can’t abruptly stop seeing him. Everyone’d say you and he were\nmeeting secretly.”",
        "“Really!”",
        "“But you can be careful how you treat him. You can show him, and\neverybody, that there’s nothing in it. You must–” Henrietta hesitated,\ndared; “you must be just friendly, as you are with Arden and the rest\nof the men.”",
        "Hiram’s daughter was scarlet. Full a minute, and a very full minute, of\nsilence. Then Adelaide said coldly: “Thank you. And now that you’ve freed\nyour mind I hope you’ll keep it free for your own affairs.”",
        "“Ouch!” cried Henrietta, making a wry face. And she devoted the rest of\nthe afternoon to what she realized, at the parting, was the vain task of\nmollifying Del. She knew that thenceforth she and Adelaide would drift\napart; and she was sorry, for she liked her–liked to talk with her,\nliked to go about with her. Adelaide’s beauty attracted the men, and a\nmale audience was essential to Henrietta’s happiness; she found the\nconversation of women–the women she felt socially at ease with–tedious,\nand their rather problematic power of appreciation limited to what came\nfrom men. As she grew older, and less and less pleasing to the eye, the\nmen showed more and more clearly how they had deceived themselves in\nthinking it was her brains that had made them like her. As Henrietta,\nwith mournful cynicism, put it: “Men the world over care little about\nwomen beyond their physical charm. To realize it, look at us American\nwomen, who can do nothing toward furthering men’s ambitions. We’ve only\nour physical charms to offer; we fall when we lose them. And so our old\nwomen and our homely women, except those that work or that have big\nhouses and social power, have no life of their own, live on sufferance,\nalone or the slaves of their daughters or of some pretty young woman to\nwhom they attach themselves.”",
        "The days dragged for Adelaide. “I’m afraid he’ll write,” said\nshe–meaning that she hoped he would. Indeed, she felt that he had\nwritten, but had destroyed the letters. And she was right; almost all\nthe time he could spare from his efforts to save his father from a sick\nbut obstinately active man’s bad judgment was given to writing to\nher–formal letters which he tore up as too formal, passionate letters\nwhich he destroyed as unwarranted and unwise, when he had not yet, face\nto face, in words, told her his love and drawn from her what he believed\nwas in her heart. The days dragged; she kept away from Henrietta, from\nall “our set,” lest they should read in her dejected countenance the\ntruth, and more.",
        "Madelene’s anteroom was full of poor people. They flocked to her, though\nshe did not pauperize them by giving her services free. She had got the\nreputation of miraculous cures, the theory in the tenements being that\nher father had swindled his satanic “familiar” by teaching his daughter\nwithout price what he had had to pay for with his immortal soul. Adelaide\nrefused the chair a sick-looking young artisan awkwardly pressed upon\nher. Leaning against the window seat, she tried to interest herself in\nher fellow-invalids. But she had not then the secret which unlocks the\nmystery of faces; she was still in the darkness in which most of us\nproudly strut away our lives, deriding as dreamers or cranks those who\nare in the light and see. With almost all of us the innate sympathies of\nrace, which give even wolves and vultures the sense of fraternal\ncompanionship in the storm and stress of the struggle for existence, are\ndeep overlaid with various kinds of that egotistic ignorance called class\nfeeling. Adelaide felt sorry for “the poor,” but she had yet to learn\nthat she was of them, as poor in other and more important ways as they in\nmoney and drawing-room manners. Surfaces and the things of the surface\nobscured or distorted all the realities for her, as for most of us; and\nthe fact that her intelligence laughed at and scorned her perverted\ninstincts was of as little help to her as it is to most of us.",
        "When Madelene was free she said to her sister-in-law, in mock\nseriousness, “Well, and what can I do for you!” as if she were\nanother patient.",
        "Adelaide’s eyes shifted. Clearly Madelene’s keen, pretense-scattering\ngaze was not one to invite to inspect a matter which might not look at\nall well stripped of its envelopes of phrase and haze. She wished she had\nnot come; indeed, she had been half-wishing it during the whole\nthree-quarters of an hour of watching and thinking on Madelene’s\nwonderful life, so crowded with interest, with achievement, with all that\nHiram Ranger’s daughter called, and believed, “the real thing.”",
        "“Nothing, nothing at all,” replied she to Madelene’s question. “I just\ndropped in to annoy you with my idle self–or, maybe, to please you. You\nknow we’re taught at church that a large part of the joy of the saved\ncomes from watching the misery of the damned.”",
        "But Madelene had the instinct of the physician born. “She has something\non her mind and wants me to help her,” she thought. Aloud she said: “I\nfeel idle, myself. We’ll sit about for an hour, and you’ll stay to dinner\nwith Arthur and me–we have it here to-day, as your mother is going out.\nAfterwards I must do my round.”",
        "A silence, with Adelaide wondering where Ross was and just when he would\nreturn. Then Madelene went on: “I’ve been trying to persuade your mother\nto give up the house, change it into a hospital.”",
        "The impudence of it! Their house, their home; and this newcomer into\nthe family–a newcomer from nowhere–trying to get it away from them!\n\"Mother said something about it,” said Adelaide frostily. “But she\ndidn’t say you had been at her. I think she ought to be left alone in\nher old age.”",
        "“The main thing is to keep her interested in life, don’t you think?\"\nsuggested Madelene, noting how Adelaide was holding herself in check, but\ndisregarding it. “Your mother’s a plain, natural person and never has\nfelt at home in that big house. Indeed, I don’t think any human being\never does feel at home in a big house. There was a time when they fitted\nin with the order of things; but now they’ve become silly, it seems to\nme, except for public purposes. When we all get sensible and go in for\nbeing somebody instead of for showing off, we’ll live in convenient,\ncomfortable, really tasteful and individual houses and have big buildings\nonly for general use.”",
        "“I’m afraid the world will never grow up into your ideals, Madelene,\"\nsaid Del with restrained irony. “At least not in our day.”",
        "“I’m in no hurry,” replied Madelene good-naturedly. “The most\nsatisfactory thing about common sense is that one can act on it without\nwaiting for others to get round to it. But we weren’t talking of those\nwho would rather be ignorantly envied than intelligently happy. We were\ntalking of your mother.”",
        "“Mother was content with her mode of life until you put these ’advanced’\nideas into her head.”",
        "“’Advanced’ is hardly the word,” said Madelene. “They used to be her\nideas–always have been, underneath. If it weren’t that she is afraid of\nhurting your feelings, she’d not hesitate an instant. She’d take the\nsmall house across the way and give herself the happiness of helping with\nthe hospital she’d install in the big house. You know she always had a\npassion for waiting on people. Here’s her chance to gratify it to good\npurpose. Why should she let the fact that she has money enough not to\nhave to work stand between her and happy usefulness?”",
        "“What does Arthur think?” asked Del. Her resentment was subsiding in\nspite of her determined efforts to keep it glowing; Madelene knew the\nsecret of manner that enables one to be habitually right without giving\nothers the sense of being put irritatingly in the wrong. “But,” smiling,\n\"I needn’t inquire. Of course he assents to whatever you say.”",
        "“You know Arthur better than that,” replied Madelene, with no trace of\nresentment. She had realized from the beginning of the conversation that\nDel’s nerves were on edge; her color, alternately rising and fading, and\nher eyes, now sparkling now dull, could only mean fever from a tempest of\nsecret emotion. “He and I usually agree simply because we see things in\nabout the same light.”",
        "“You furnish the light,” teased Adelaide.",
        "“That was in part so at first,” admitted her sister-in-law. “Arthur had\ngot many foolish notions in his head through accepting thoughtlessly the\nideas of the people he traveled with. But, once he let his good sense get\nthe upper hand–He helps me now far more than I help him.”",
        "“Has he consented to let them give him a salary yet?” asked Adelaide,\nnot because she was interested, but because she desperately felt that\nthe conversation must be kept alive. Perhaps Ross was even now on his\nway to Saint X.",
        "“He still gets what he fixed on at first–ten dollars a week more than\nthe foreman.”",
        "“Honestly, Madelene,” said Adelaide, in a flush and flash of\nirritation, “don’t you think that’s absurd? With the responsibility of\nthe whole business on his shoulders, you know he ought to have more\nthan a common workman.”",
        "“In the first place you must not forget that everyone is paid very high\nwages at the university works now.”",
        "“And he’s the cause of that–of the mills doing so well,” said Del. She\ncould see Ross entering the gates–at the house–inquiring–What was she\ntalking to Madelene about? Yes, about Arthur and the mills. “Even the men\nthat criticise him–Arthur, I mean–most severely for ’sowing discontent\nin the working class,’ as they call it,” she went on, “concede that he\nhas wonderful business ability. So he ought to have a huge salary.”",
        "“No doubt he earns it,” replied Madelene. “But the difficulty is that he\ncan’t take it without it’s coming from the other workmen. You see, money\nis coined sweat. All its value comes from somebody’s labor. He deserves\nto be rewarded for happening to have a better brain than most men, and\nfor using it better. But there’s no fund for rewarding the clever for\nbeing cleverer than most of their fellow-beings, any more than there’s a\nfund to reward the handsome for being above the average in looks. So he\nhas to choose between robbing his fellow-workmen, who are in his power,\nand going without riches. He prefers going without.”",
        "“That’s very noble of you both, I’m sure,” said Adelaide absently.\nThe Chicago express would be getting in at four o’clock–about five\nhours. Absurd! The morning papers said Mr. Whitney had had a relapse.\n\"Very noble,” she repeated absently. “But I doubt if anybody will\nappreciate it.”",
        "Madelene smiled cheerfully. “That doesn’t worry Arthur or me,” said she,\nwith her unaffected simplicity. “We’re not looking for appreciation.\nWe’re looking for a good time.” Del, startled, began to listen to\nMadelene. A good time–\"And it so happens,” came in Madelene’s sweet,\nhonest voice, “that we’re unable to have it, unless we feel that we\naren’t getting it by making some one else have a not-so-good time or a\nvery bad time indeed. You’ve heard of Arthur’s latest scheme?”",
        "“Some one told me he was playing smash at the mills, encouraging the\nworkmen to idleness and all that sort of thing,” said Del. Somehow she\nfelt less feverish, seemed compelled to attention by Madelene’s voice and\neyes. “But I didn’t hear or understand just how.”",
        "“He’s going to establish a seven-hours’ working day; and, if possible,\ncut it down to six.” Madelene’s eyes were sparkling. Del watched her\nlongingly, enviously. How interested she was in these useful things. How\nfine it must be to be interested where one could give one’s whole heart\nwithout concealment–or shame! “And,” Madelene was saying, “the\nuniversity is to change its schedules so that all its practical courses\nwill be at hours when men working in the factory can take them. It’s\nsimply another development of his and Dory’s idea that a factory\nbelonging to a university ought to set a decent example–ought not to\ncompel its men to work longer than is necessary for them to earn at\nhonest wages a good living for themselves and their families.”",
        "“So that they can sit round the saloons longer,” suggested Adelaide, and\nthen she colored and dropped her eyes; she was repeating Ross’s comment\non this sort of “concession to the working classes.” She had thought it\nparticularly acute when he made it. Now–",
        "“No doubt most of them will spend their time foolishly at first,\"\nMadelene conceded. “Working people have had to work so hard for\nothers–twelve, fourteen, sixteen hours a day, just to be allowed to\nlive–that they’ve had really no free time at all; so they’ve had no\nchance to learn how to spend free time sensibly. But they’ll learn, those\nof them that have capacity for improvement. Those that haven’t will soon\ndrop out.”",
        "“The factories can’t make money on such a plan as that,” said Adelaide,\nagain repeating a remark of Ross’s, but deliberately, because she\nbelieved it could be answered, wished to hear it answered.",
        "“No, not dividends,” replied Madelene. “But dividends are to be abolished\nin that department of the university, just as they are in the other\ndepartments. And the money the university needs is to come from tuition\nfees. Everyone is to pay for what he gets. Some one has to pay for it;\nwhy not the person who gets the benefit? Especially when the university’s\nfarms and workshops and factories give every student, man and woman, a\nchance to earn a good living. I tell you Adelaide, the time is coming\nwhen every kind of school except kindergarten will be self-supporting.\nAnd then you’ll see a human race that is really fine, really capable, has\na real standard of self-respect.”",
        "As Madelene talked, her face lighted up and all her latent magnetism was\nradiating. Adelaide, for no reason that was clear to her, yielded to a\nsurge of impulse and, half-laughing, half in tears, suddenly kissed\nMadelene. “No wonder Arthur is mad about you, stark mad,” she cried.",
        "Madelene was for a moment surprised out of that perfect\nself-unconsciousness which is probably the rarest of human qualities, and\nwhich was her greatest charm to those who knew her well. She blushed\nfuriously and angrily. Her and Arthur’s love was to her most sacred,\nabsolutely between themselves. When any outsider could observe them,\neven her sister Walpurga, she seemed so much the comrade and\nfellow-worker in her attitude toward him that people thought and spoke of\ntheir married life as “charming, but cold.” Alone with him, she showed\nthat which was for him alone–a passion whose strength had made him\nstrong, as the great waves give their might to the swimmer who does not\nshrink from adventuring them. Adelaide’s impulsive remark, had violated\nher profoundest modesty; and in the shock she showed it.",
        "“I beg your pardon!” exclaimed Adelaide, though she did not realize\nwherein she had offended. Love was an unexplored, an unsuspected mystery\nto her then–the more a mystery because she thought she knew from having\nread about it and discussed it and reasoned about it.",
        "“Oh, I understand,” said Madelene, contrite for her betraying expression.\n\"Only–some day–when you really fall in love–you’ll know why I was\nstartled.”",
        "Adelaide shrank within herself. “Even Madelene,” thought she, “who\nhas not a glance for other people’s affairs, knows how it is between\nDory and me.”",
        "It was Madelene’s turn to be repentant and apologetic. “I didn’t mean\nquite that,” she stammered. “Of course I know you care for Dory–”",
        "The tears came to Del’s eyes and the high color to her cheeks. “You\nneedn’t make excuses,” she cried. “It’s the truth. I don’t care–in\nthat way.”",
        "A silence; then Madelene, gently: “Was this what you came to tell me?”",
        "Adelaide nodded slowly. “Yes, though I didn’t know it.”",
        "“Why tell me?”",
        "“Because I think I care for another man.” Adelaide was not looking away.\nOn the contrary, as she spoke, saying the words in an even, reflective\ntone, she returned her sister-in-law’s gaze fully, frankly. “And I don’t\nknow what to do. It’s very complicated–doubly complicated.”",
        "“The one you were first engaged to?”",
        "“Yes,” said Del. “Isn’t it pitiful in me?” And there was real\nself-contempt in her voice and in her expression. “I assumed that I\ndespised him because he was selfish and calculating, and such a snob!\nNow I find I don’t mind his selfishness, and that I, too, am a snob.” She\nsmiled drearily. “I suppose you feel the proper degree of contempt and\naversion.”",
        "“We are all snobs,” answered Madelene tranquilly. “It’s one of the\ndeepest dyes of the dirt we came from, the hardest to wash out.”",
        "“Besides,” pursued Adelaide, “he and I have both learned by\nexperience–which has come too late; it always does.”",
        "“Not at all,” said Madelene briskly. “Experience is never too late. It’s\nalways invaluably useful in some way, no matter when it comes.”",
        "Adelaide was annoyed by Madelene’s lack of emotion. She had thought her\nsister-in-law would be stirred by a recital so romantic, so dark with the\nmenace of tragedy. Instead, the doctor was acting as if she were dealing\nwith mere measles. Adelaide, unconsciously, of course–we are never\nconscious of the strong admixture of vanity in our “great” emotions–was\npiqued into explaining. “We can never be anything to each other. There’s\nDory; then there’s Theresa. And I’d suffer anything rather than bring\nshame and pain on others.”",
        "Madelene smiled–somehow not irritatingly–an appeal to Del’s sense of\nproportion. “Suffer,” repeated she. “That’s a good strong word for a\nwoman to use who has health and youth and beauty, and material\ncomfort–and a mind capable of an infinite variety of interests.\"\nAdelaide’s tragic look was slipping from her. “Don’t take too gloomy a\nview,” continued the physician. “Disease and death and one other thing\nare the only really serious ills. In this case of yours everything will\ncome round quite smooth, if you don’t get hysterical and if Ross Whitney\nis really in earnest and not\"–Madelene’s tone grew even more\ndeliberate–\"not merely getting up a theatrical romance along the lines\nof the ’high-life’ novels you idle people set such store by.” She saw, in\nDel’s wincing, that the shot had landed. “No,” she went on, “your case is\none of the commonplaces of life among those people–and they’re in all\nclasses–who look for emotions and not for opportunities to be useful.”",
        "Del smiled, and Madelene hailed the returning sense of humor as an\nencouraging sign.",
        "“The one difficult factor is Theresa,” said Madelene, pushing on with the\nprescription. “She–I judge from what I’ve heard–she’s what’s commonly\ncalled a ’poor excuse for a woman.’ We all know that type. You may be\nsure her vanity would soon find ways of consoling her. Ninety-nine times\nout of a hundred where one holds on after the other has let go the reason\nis vanity, wounded vanity–where it isn’t the material consideration that\nexplains why there are so many abandoned wives and so few abandoned\nhusbands. Theresa doesn’t really care for her husband; love that isn’t\nmutual isn’t love. So she’d come up smiling for a second husband.”",
        "“She’s certainly vain,” said Del. “Losing him would all but kill her.”",
        "“Not if it’s done tactfully,” replied Madelene. “Ross’ll no doubt be glad\nto sacrifice his own vanity and so arrange matters that she’ll be able to\nsay and feel that she got rid of him, not he of her. Of course that means\na large sacrifice of his vanity–and of yours, too. But neither of you\nwill mind that.”",
        "Adelaide looked uncomfortable; Madelene took advantage of her abstraction\nto smile at the confession hinted in that look.",
        "“As for Dory–”",
        "At that name Del colored and hung her head.",
        "“As for Dory,” repeated Madelene, not losing the chance to emphasize the\neffect, “he’s no doubt fond of you. But no matter what he–or you–may\nimagine, his fondness cannot be deeper than that of a man for a woman\nbetween whom and him there isn’t the perfect love that makes one of two.”",
        "“I don’t understand his caring for me,” cried Del. “I can’t believe he\ndoes.” This in the hope of being contradicted.",
        "But Madelene simply said: “Perhaps he’d not feel toward you as he seems\nto think he does if he hadn’t known you before you went East and got fond\nof the sort of thing that attracts you in Ross Whitney. Anyhow, Dory’s\nthe kind of man to be less unhappy over losing you than over keeping you\nwhen you didn’t want to stay. You may be like his eyes to him, but you\nknow if that sort of man loses his sight he puts seeing out of the\ncalculation and goes on just the same. Dory Hargrave is a man; and a\nreal man is bigger than any love affair, however big.”",
        "Del was trying to hide the deep and smarting wound to her vanity. “You\nare right, Madelene,” said she. “Dory is cold.”",
        "“But I didn’t say that,” replied Madelene. “Most of us prefer people like\nthose flabby sea creatures that are tossed aimlessly about by the waves\nand have no permanent shape or real purposes and desires, but take\nwhatever their feeble tentacles can hold without effort.” Del winced, and\nit was the highest tribute to Dr. Madelene’s skill that the patient did\nnot hate her and refuse further surgery. “We’re used to that sort,\"\ncontinued she. “So when a really alive, vigorous, pushing, and resisting\npersonality comes in contact with us, we say, ’How hard! How unfeeling!’\nThe truth, of course, is that Ross is more like the flabby things–his\nenvironment dominates him, while Dory dominates his environment. But you\nlike the Ross sort, and you’re right to suit yourself. To suit yourself\nis the only way to avoid making a complete failure of life. Wait till\nDory comes home. Then talk it out with him. Then–free yourself and marry\nRoss, who will have freed himself. It’s quite simple. People are\nbroad-minded about divorce nowadays. It never causes serious scandal,\nexcept among those who’d like to do the same, but don’t dare.”",
        "It certainly was easy, and ought to have been attractive. Yet Del was not\nattracted. “One can’t deal with love in such a cold, calculating\nfashion,” thought she, by way of bolstering up her weakening confidence\nin the reality and depth of those sensations which had seemed so\nthrillingly romantic an hour before. “I’ve given you the impression that\nRoss and I have some–some understanding,” said she. “But we haven’t. For\nall I know, he may not care for me as I care for him.”",
        "“He probably doesn’t,” was Madelene’s douche-like reply. “You attract him\nphysically–which includes his feeling that you’d show off better than\nTheresa before the world for which he cares so much. But, after all,\nthat’s much the way you care for him, isn’t it?”",
        "Adelaide’s bosom was swelling and falling agitatedly. Her eyes flashed;\nher reserve vanished. “I’m sure he’d love me!” cried she. “He’d give me\nwhat my whole soul, my whole body cry out for. Madelene, you don’t\nunderstand! I am so starved, so out in the cold! I want to go in where\nit’s warm–and–human!” The truth, the deep-down truth, was out at last;\nAdelaide had wrenched it from herself.",
        "“And Dory will not give you that?” said Madelene, all gentleness and\nsympathy, and treading softly on this dangerous, delicate ground.",
        "“He gives me nothing!” exclaimed Adelaide bitterly. “He is waiting for me\nto learn to love him. He ought to know that a woman has to be taught to\nlove–at least the sort of woman I am. He treats me as if I were his\nequal, when he ought to see that I’m not; that I’m like a child, and have\nto be shown what’s good for me, and made to take it.”",
        "“Then, perhaps, after all,” said Madelene slowly, “you do care for Dory.”",
        "“Of course I care for him; how could anyone help it? But he won’t let\nme–he won’t let me!” She was on the verge of hysteria, and her loss of\nself-control was aggravated by the feeling that she was making a weak,\nsilly exhibition of herself.",
        "“If you do care for Dory, and Dory cares for you, and you don’t care for\nRoss–” began Madelene.",
        "“But I do care for Ross, too! Oh, I must be bad–bad! Could a nice woman\ncare for two men at the same time?”",
        "“I’d have said not,” was Madelene’s answer. “But now I see that she\ncould–and I see why.”",
        "“Dory means something to me that Ross does not. Ross means something that\nDory does not. I want it all–all that both of them represent. I can’t\ngive up Dory; I can’t give up Ross. You don’t understand, Madelene,\nbecause you’ve had the good luck to get it all from Arthur.”",
        "After a silence, Madelene said: “Well, Del, what are you going to do?”",
        "“Nothing.”",
        "“That’s sensible!” approved Madelene. “If Ross really loves you, then,\nwhether he can have you or not, he’ll free himself from Theresa. He\nsimply couldn’t go on with her. And if you really care for him, then,\nwhen Dory comes home he’ll free you.”",
        "“That ought to be so,” said Adelaide, not seeing the full meaning of\nMadelene’s last words. “But it isn’t. Neither Ross nor I is strong\nenough. We’re just ordinary people, the sort that most everybody is and\nthat most everybody despises when they see them or read about them as\nthey really are. No, he and I will each do the conventional thing. We’ll\ngo our separate ways “–contemptuously–\"the easiest ways. And we’ll\nregard ourselves as martyrs to duty–that’s how they put it in the\nnovels, isn’t it?”",
        "“At least,” said Madelene, with a calmness she was far from feeling,\n\"both you and Ross have had your lesson in the consequence of doing\nthings in a hurry.”",
        "“That’s the only way people brought up as we’ve been ever do anything. If\nwe don’t act on impulse, we don’t act at all; we drift on.”",
        "“Drifting is action, the most decisive kind of action.” Madelene was\nagain thinking what would surely happen the instant Dory found how\nmatters stood; but she deemed it tactful to keep this thought to herself.\nJust then she was called to the telephone. When she came back she found\nAdelaide restored to her usual appearance–the fashionable,\nlight-hearted, beautiful woman, mistress of herself, and seeming as\nsecure against emotional violence from within as against discourtesy from\nwithout. But she showed how deep was the impression of Madelene’s\ncommon-sense analysis of her romance by saying: “A while ago you said\nthere were only three serious ills, disease and death, but you didn’t\nname the third. What is it?”",
        "“Dishonor,” said Madelene, with a long, steady look at her.",
        "Adelaide paled slightly, but met her sister-in-law’s level gaze. “Yes,\"\nwas all she said.",
        "A silence; then Madelene: “Your problem, Del, is simple; is no problem\nat all, so far as Dory or Ross’s wife is concerned; or the whole outside\nworld, for that matter. It’s purely personal; it’s altogether the\nproblem of bringing pain and shame on yourself. The others’ll get over\nit; but can you?”",
        "Del made no reply. A moment later Arthur came; after dinner she left\nbefore he did, and so was not alone with Madelene again. Reviewing her\namazing confessions to her sister-in-law, she was both sorry and not\nsorry. Her mind was undoubtedly relieved, but at the price of showing to\nanother her naked soul, and that other a woman–true, an unusual woman,\nby profession a confessor, but still a woman. Thenceforth some one other\nthan herself would know her as she really was–not at all the nice,\ndelicate lady with instincts as fine as those of the heroines of novels,\nwho, even at their most realistic, are pictured as fully and grandly\ndressed of soul in the solitude of bedroom as in crowded drawing-room. “I\ndon’t care!” concluded Adelaide. “If she, or anyone, thinks the worse of\nme for being a human being, it will show either hypocrisy or ignorance of\nhuman nature.”",
        "A few evenings later, Del, in a less strained, less despondent frame of\nmind, coming home from supper at her mother’s, found Estelle Wilmot on\nthe front veranda talking with Lorry Tague. She had seen this same sight\nperhaps half-a-dozen times since Estelle and Arden had come to stop with\nher at the Villa d’Orsay. On this particular evening his manner toward\nEstelle was no different from what it had been the other times; yet, as\nDel approached them, she felt the electric atmosphere which so often\nenvelops two who love each other, and betrays their secret carefully\nguarded behind formal manner and indifferent look and tone. She wondered\nthat she had been blind to what was now obvious.",
        "“Well, Arthur has at last compelled you to go to work,” said she\nsmilingly to the big cooper with the waving tawny hair and the keen, kind\ngray eyes. Then, to show her respect for the secret, she said to Estelle,\n\"Perhaps he hasn’t told you that he was made superintendent of the\ncooperage to-day?”",
        "Estelle blushed a little, her eyes dancing. “He was just telling me,\"\nreplied she.",
        "“I understand why you yielded,” continued Adelaide to Lorry. “Arthur has\nbeen showing me the plans for the new factories. Gardens all round, big\nwindows, high ceilings, everything done by electricity, no smoke or soot,\na big swimming pool for winter or summer, a big restaurant, dressing\nrooms–everything! Who’d have believed that work could be carried on in\nsuch surroundings?”",
        "“It’s about time, isn’t it,” said Lorry, in his slow, musical voice,\n\"that idleness was deprived of its monopoly of comforts and luxuries?”",
        "“How sensible that is!” said Del admiringly. “Yet nobody thinks of it.”",
        "“Why,” Lorry went on, “the day’ll come when they’ll look back on the way\nwe work nowadays, as we do on the time when a lot of men never went out\nto work except in chains and with keepers armed with lashes. The fellows\nthat call Dory and Arthur crazy dreamers don’t realize what ignorant\nsavages they themselves are.”",
        "“They have no imagination,” said Estelle.",
        "“No imagination,” echoed Lorry. “That’s the secret of the stupidity and\nthe horror of change, and of the notion that the way a thing’s done\nto-day is the way it’ll always be done.”",
        "“I’m afraid Arthur is going to get himself into even deeper trouble when\nthese new plans are announced,” said Del.",
        "Arthur’s revolution had already inflamed the other manufacturers at Saint\nX against him. Huge incomes were necessary to the support of their\nextravagant families and to the increase of the fortunes they were piling\nup “to save their children from fear of want\"–as if that same “fear of\nwant” were not the only known spur to the natural lethargy of the human\nanimal! They explained to their workmen that the university industries\nwere not business enterprises at all, and therefore must not be confused\nand compared with enterprises that were “practical\"; but the workmen\nfixed tenaciously upon the central fact that the university’s men worked\nat mechanical labor fewer hours each day by four to seven, and even\neight, got higher wages, got more out of life in every way. Nor was there\nany of the restraint and degradation of the “model town.” The workers\ncould live and act as they pleased; it was by the power of an intelligent\npublic opinion that Arthur was inducing his fellows and their families to\nbuild for themselves attractive homes, to live in tasteful comfort, to\nacquire sane habits of eating, drinking, and personal appearance. And no\none was more amazed than himself at the swiftness with which the\noverwhelming majority responded to the opportunity. Small wonder that\nthe other manufacturers, who at best never went beyond the crafty,\ninexpensive schemes of benevolent charity, were roaring against the\nuniversity as a “hotbed of anarchy.”",
        "At Adelaide’s suggestion of the outburst that would follow the new and\nstill more “inflammatory” revolution, Lorry shrugged his shoulders and\nlaughed easily. “Nobody need worry for that brother of yours, Mrs.\nHargrave,” said he. “There may be some factories for sale cheap before\nmany years. If so, the university can buy them in and increase its\nusefulness. Dory and Arthur are going to have a university that will be\nup to the name before they get through–one for all ages and kinds, and\nboth sexes, and for everybody all his life long and in all his\nrelations.”",
        "“It’s a beautiful dream,” said Del. She was remembering how Dory used to\nenlarge upon it in Paris until his eloquence made her feel that she loved\nhim at the same time that it also gave her a chilling sense of his being\nfar from her, too big and impersonal for so intimate and personal a thing\nas the love she craved. “A beautiful dream,” she repeated with a sigh.",
        "“That’s the joy of life,” said Estelle, “isn’t it? To have beautiful\ndreams, and to help make them come true.”",
        "“And this one is actually coming true,” said Lorry. “Wait a few years,\nonly a few, and you’ll see the discoveries of science make everything so\ncheap that vulgar, vain people will give up vulgarity and vanity in\ndespair. A good many of the once aristocratic vulgarities have been\ncheapened into absurdity already. The rest will follow.”",
        "“Only a few years?” said Del, laughing, yet more than half-convinced.",
        "“Use your imagination, Mrs. Hargrave,” replied Lorry, in his large,\ngood-humored way. “Don’t be afraid to be sensible just because most\npeople look on common sense as insanity. A hundred things that used to be\nluxuries for the king alone are now so cheap that the day-laborer has\nthem–all in less than two lifetimes of real science! To-morrow or next\nday some one will discover, say, the secret of easily and cheaply\ninterchanging the so-called elements. Bang! the whole structure of\nswagger and envy will collapse!”",
        "They all laughed, and Del went into the house. “Estelle–no woman, no\nmatter who–could hope to get a better husband than Lorry,” she was\nthinking. “And, now that he’s superintendent, there’s no reason why they\nshouldn’t marry. What a fine thing, what an American thing, that a man\nwith no chance at all in the start should be able to develop himself so\nthat a girl like Estelle could–yes, and should–be proud of his love and\nproud to love him.” She recalled how Lorry at the high school was about\nthe most amusing of the boys, with the best natural manner, and far and\naway the best dancer; how he used to be invited everywhere, until\nexcitement about fashion and “family” reached Saint X; how he was then\ngradually dropped until he, realizing what was the matter, haughtily\n\"cut” all his former friends and associates. “We’ve certainly been racing\ndownhill these last few years. Where the Wilmots used to be about the\nonly silly people in town, there are scores of families now with noses in\nthe air and eyes looking eagerly about for chances to snub. But, on the\nother hand, there’s the university, and Arthur–and Dory.” She dismissed\nLorry and Estelle and Saint X’s fashionable strivings and, in the\nlibrary, sat down to compose a letter to Dory–no easy task in those\ndays, when there were seething in her mind and heart so much that she\nlonged to tell him but ought not, so much that she ought to tell but\ncould not.",
        "Lorry had acted as if he were about to depart, while Adelaide was there;\nhe resumed his seat on the steps at Estelle’s feet as soon as she\ndisappeared. “I suppose I ought to go,” said he, with a humorous glance\nup at her face with its regular features and steadfast eyes.",
        "She ran her slim fingers through his hair, let the tips of them linger an\ninstant on his lips before she took her hand away.",
        "“I couldn’t let you go just yet,” said she slowly, absently. “This is the\nclimax of the day. In this great, silent, dim light all my dreams–all\nour dreams–seem to become realities and to be trooping down from the sky\nto make us happy.”",
        "A pause, then he: “I can see them now.” But soon he moved to rise. “It\nfrightens me to be as happy as I am this evening. I must go, dear. We’re\ngetting bolder and bolder. First thing you know, your brother will be\nsuspecting–and that means your mother.”",
        "“I don’t seem to care any more,” replied the girl. “Mother is really in\nmuch better health, and has got pretty well prepared to expect almost\nanything from me. She has become resigned to me as a ’working person.’\nThen, too, I’m thoroughly inoculated with the habit of doing as I please.\nI guess that’s from being independent and having my own money. What a\ngood thing money is!”",
        "“So long as it means independence,” suggested Lorry; “but not after it\nmeans dependence.”",
        "But Estelle was thinking of their future. The delay, the seemingly\nendless delay, made her even more impatient than it made him, as is\nalways the case where the woman is really in love. In the man love holds\nthe impetuosity of passion in leash; in the woman it rouses the deeper,\nthe more enduring force of the maternal instinct–not merely the\nunconscious or, at most, half-conscious longing for the children that are\nto be, but the desire to do for the man–to look after his health, his\nphysical comfort, to watch over and protect him; for, to the woman in\nlove, the man seems in those humble ways less strong than she–a helpless\ncreature, dependent on her. “It’s going to be much harder to wait,” said\nshe, “now that you are superintendent and I have bought out Mrs.\nHastings’s share of my business.”",
        "They both laughed, but Lorry said: “It’s no joke. A little too much money\nhas made fools of as wise people as we are–many and many’s the time.”",
        "“Not as wise a person as you are, and as you’ll always make me be, or\nseem to be,” replied Estelle.",
        "Lorry pressed his big hand over hers for an instant. “Now that I’ve left\noff real work,” said he, “I’ll soon be able to take your hand without\ngiving you a rough reminder of the difference between us.”",
        "He held out his hands, palms upward. They were certainly not soft and\nsmooth, but they more than made up in look of use and strength what they\nlacked in smoothness. She put her small hands one on either side of his,\nand they both thrilled with the keen pleasure the touch of edge of hand\nagainst edge of hand gave them. In the ends of her fingers were the marks\nof her needlework. He bent and kissed those slightly roughened finger\nends passionately. “I love those marks!” he exclaimed. “They make me feel\nthat we belong to each other.”",
        "“I’d be sorry to see your hands different,” said she, her eyes shining\nupon his. “There are many things you don’t understand about me–for\ninstance, that it’s just those marks of work that make you so dear to me.\nA woman may begin by liking a man because he’s her ideal in certain ways,\nbut once she really cares, she loves whatever is part of him.”",
        "In addition to the reasons she had given for feeling “bolder” about her\n\"plebeian” lover, there was another that was the strongest of all. A few\nmonths before, a cousin of her father’s had died in Boston, where he was\nthe preacher of a most exclusive and fashionable church. He had endeared\nhimself to his congregation by preaching one Easter Sunday a sermon\ncalled “The Badge of Birth.” In it he proceeded to show from the\nScriptures themselves how baseless was the common theory that Jesus was\nof lowly origin. “The common people heard Him gladly,” cried the Rev.\nEliot Wilmot, “because they instinctively felt His superiority of birth,\nfelt the dominance of His lineage. In His veins flowed the blood of the\nroyal house of Israel, the blood of the first anointed kings of Almighty\nGod.” And from this interesting premise the Reverend Wilmot deduced the\ndivine intent that the “best blood” should have superior\nrights–leadership, respect, deference. So dear was he to his flock that\nthey made him rich in this world’s goods as well as in love and honor.\nThe Wilmots of Saint X had had lively expectations from his estate. They\nthought that one holding the views eloquently set forth in “The Badge of\nBirth” must dedicate his fortune to restoring the dignity and splendor of\nthe main branch of the Wilmot family. But, like all their dreams, this\ncame to naught. His fortune went to a theological seminary to endow\nscholarships and fellowships for decayed gentlemen’s sons; he remembered\nonly Verbena Wilmot. On his one visit to the crumbling, weed-choked seat\nof the head of the house, he had seen Verbena’s wonderful hands, so\nprecious and so useless that had she possessed rings and deigned to wear\nthem she would not have permitted the fingers of the one hand to put them\non the fingers of the other. The legacy was five thousand dollars, at\nfour per cent., an income of two hundred dollars a year. Verbena invested\nthe first quarterly installment in a long-dreamed-of marble reproduction\nof her right hand which, after years of thinking daily about the matter,\nshe had decided was a shade more perfect than the left.",
        "If one dim eye makes a man king among blind men–to translate to the\nvernacular Verbena’s elegant reasoning–an income, however trifling, if\nit have no taint of toil, no stench of sweat upon it, makes its possessor\nentitled to royal consideration in a family of paupers and dead beats,\ndegraded by harboring a breadwinner of an Estelle. No sudden recipient of\na dazzling, drenching shower of wealth was ever more exalted than was\nVerbena, once in possession of ’my legacy.” Until the Rev. Eliot\nWilmot’s posthumous blessing descended upon her, the Wilmots lived\ntogether in comparative peace and loving kindness. They were all, except\nfor their mania of genealogy, good-humored, extremely well-mannered\npeople, courteous as much by nature as by deliberate intent. But, with\nthe coming of the blessing, peace and friendliness in that family were at\nan end. Old Preston Wilmot and Arden railed unceasingly against the\n\"traitor” Eliot; Verbena defended him. Their mother and Estelle were\ndrawn into the battle from time to time, Estelle always against her will.\nBefore Verbena had been a woman of property three months, she was hating\nher father and brother for their sneers and insults, Arden had gone back\nto drinking, and the old gentleman was in a savage and most ungentlemanly\nhumor from morning until night.",
        "Estelle, the “black sheep” ever since she began to support them by\nengaging in trade, drew aloof now, was at home as little as she could\ncontrive, often ate a cold supper in the back of her shop. She said\nnothing to Lorry of the family shame; she simply drew nearer to him. And\nout of this changed situation came, unconsciously to herself, a deep\ncontempt for her father and her brother, a sense that she was indeed as\nalien as the Wilmots so often alleged, in scorn of her and her shop;\nVerbena’s income went to buy adornments for herself, dresses that would\ngive the hands a fitting background; Estelle’s earnings went to her\nmother, who distributed them, the old gentleman and Arden ignoring whence\nand how the money came.",
        "As Estelle and Lorry lingered on the porch of the Villa d’Orsay that\nAugust evening, alone in the universe under that vast, faintly luminous,\nlate-twilight sky, Arden Wilmot came up the lawn. Neither Lorry nor\nEstelle saw or heard him until his voice, rough with drink and passion,\nsavagely stung them with, “What the hell does this mean?”",
        "Lorry dropped Estelle’s hand and stood up, Estelle behind him, a\nrestraining hand on his shoulder. Both were white to the lips; their sky,\nthe moment before so clear and still, was now black and thunderous with a\nfrightful storm. Estelle saw that her brother was far from sober; and the\nsight of his sister caressed by Lorry Tague would have maddened him even\nhad he not touched liquor. She darted between the two men. “Don’t be a\ngoose, Arden,” she panted, with a hysterical attempt to laugh.",
        "“That fellow was touching you!” stormed Arden. “You miserable disgrace!\"\nAnd he lifted his hand threateningly to her.",
        "Lorry put his arm round her and drew her back, himself advancing. “You\nmust be careful how you act toward the woman who is to be my wife, Mr.\nWilmot,” he said, afire in all his blood of the man who has the right to\ndemand of the whole world the justice he gives it.",
        "Arden Wilmot stared dumfounded, first at Lorry, then at Estelle. In the\npause, Adelaide, drawn from the library by the sound of Arden’s fury,\nreached the front doorway, saw the three, instantly knew the whole cause\nof this sudden, harsh commotion. With a twitch that was like the shaking\noff of a detaining grasp, with a roar like a mortally wounded beast’s,\nArden recovered the use of limbs and voice. “You infernal lump of dirt!\"\nhe yelled. Adelaide saw his arm swing backward, then forward, and up–saw\nsomething bright in his hand. A flash–\"O God, God!” she moaned. But she\ncould not turn her eyes away or close them.",
        "Lorry stood straight as a young sycamore for an instant, turned toward\nEstelle. “Good-by–my love!” he said softly, and fell, face downward,\nwith his hands clasping the edge of her dress.",
        "And Estelle–",
        "She made no sound. Like a ghost, she knelt and took Lorry’s head in her\nlap; with one hand against each of his cheeks she turned his head.\n\"Lorry! Lorry!” she murmured in a heartbreaking voice that carried far\nthrough the stillness.",
        "Arden put the revolver back in his pocket, seized her by the\nshoulder. “Come away from that!” he ordered roughly, and half-lifted\nher to her feet.",
        "With a cry so awful that Adelaide swayed and almost swooned at hearing\nit, Estelle wrenched herself free, flung herself on her lover’s body,\nburied her fingers in his hair, covered his dead face with kisses, bathed\nher lips in the blood that welled from his heart. Shouts and heavy, quick\ntramping from many directions–the tempest of murder was drawing people\nto its center as a cyclone sucks in leaves. Fright in Arden Wilmot’s\nface, revealed to Adelaide in the light streaming from the big\ndrawing-room windows. A group–a crowd–a multitude–pouring upon the\nlawns from every direction–swirling round Arden as he stood over the\nprostrate intermingled forms of his sister and her dead lover.",
        "Then Adelaide, clinging to the door frame to steady herself, heard Arden\nsay in a loud blustering voice: “I found this fellow insulting my sister,\nand I treated him as a Wilmot always treats an insult.” And as the words\nreached her, they fired her. All her weakness, all her sense of\nhelplessness fled.",
        "Out of the circle came a man bearing unconscious Estelle, blood upon her\nface, upon her bosom, blood dripping from her hands. “Where shall I take\nher?” asked the man of Adelaide. “A doctor’s been sent for.”",
        "“Into the hall–on the sofa–at the end–and watch by her,” said Del, in\nquick, jerking tones. Her eyes were ablaze, her breath came in gusts.\nWithout waiting to see where he went with his burden, she rushed down the\nbroad steps and through the crowd, pushing them this way and that. She\nfaced Arden Wilmot–not a lady, but a woman, a flaming torch of outraged\nhuman feeling.",
        "“You lie!” she cried, and he seemed to wither before her. “You lie about\nhim and about her! You, with the very clothes you’re dressed in, the very\nliquor you’re drunk with, the very pistol that shot him down, paid for by\nher earnings! He never offended you–not by look or word. You murdered\nhim–I saw–heard. You murdered the man she was to marry, the man she\nloved–murdered him because she loved him. Look at him!”",
        "The crowd widened its circle before the sweep of her arm. Lorry’s\nblood-stained body came into view. His face, beautiful and, in its pale\ncalm, stronger than life, was open to the paling sky. “There lies a man,\"\nshe sobbed, and her tears were of the kind that make the fires of passion\nburn the fiercer. “A man any woman with a woman’s heart would have been\nproud to be loved by. And you–you’ve murdered him!”",
        "“Take care, Mrs. Hargrave,” a voice whispered in her ear. “They’ll\nlynch him.”",
        "“And why not?” she cried out. “Why should such a creature live?”",
        "A hundred men were reaching for Arden, and from the crowd rose that\nhoarse, low, hideous sound which is the first deep bay of the unleashed\nblood-madness. “No, no!” she begged in horror, and waved them back.",
        "“Adelaide!” gasped Arden, wrenching himself free and crouching at her\nfeet and clinging to her skirts. “Save me! I only did my duty as a\ngentleman.”",
        "She looked down at him in unpitying scorn, then out at the crowd. “Hear\nthat!” she cried, with a wild, terrible laugh. “A gentleman! Yes, that’s\ntrue–a gentleman. Saving your sister from the coarse contamination of an\nhonest man!” Then to the men who were dragging at him: “No, I say–no!\nLet him alone! Don’t touch the creature! He’ll only foul your hands.” And\nshe pushed them back. “Let him live. What worse fate could he have than\nto be pointed at every day of a long life as the worthless drunken thing\nwho murdered a man, and then tried to save himself by defaming his victim\nand his own sister?”",
        "Under cover of her barrier of command, the constable led Arden into the\nhouse, past where his sister lay in a swoon, and by the back way got him\nto jail. The crowd, fascinated by her beauty, which the tempest of\npassion had transfigured into terrible and compelling majesty, was\ncompletely under her control. She stayed on, facing that throng of men,\nmany of whom she knew by name, until Lorry’s body was taken away. She was\nabout to go into the house, as the crowd began quietly to disperse, when\nthere arose a murmur that made her turn quickly toward the doors. There\nwas Estelle, all disheveled and bloodstained. Her face was like death;\nher movements were like one walking in a deep sleep as she descended to\nthe lawn and came toward them.",
        "“Where is he? Where is he?” she wailed, pushing this way and that through\nthe crowd, her hands outstretched, her long fair hair streaming like a\nbridal veil. Her feet slipped on the wet grass–where it was wet with his\nblood. She staggered, swayed uncertainly, fell with her arms outstretched\nas if the earth were he she sought. She lay there moaning–the cry of her\ntortured nerves alone, for her mind was unconscious.",
        "Adelaide and Madelene, who had just come, bent to lift her. But their\nstrength failed them and they sank to their knees in terror; for, from\nthe silent crowd there burst a shriek: “Kill him, kill him!” And all in\nan instant the grounds were emptied of those thousands; and to the two\nwomen came an ever fainter but not less awful roar as the mob swept on\nuptown toward the jail.",
        "Madelene was first to recover. “Let us carry her in,” she said. And when\nthe limp form was once more on the big sofa and the eyelids were\ntrembling to unclose, she ripped open the right sleeve and thrust in the\nneedle that gives oblivion.",
        "Adelaide went to the window and listened. Before her in the moonlight was\nthe place where that tempest of hate and murder had burst and raged. Once\nmore her heart hardened in the pitiless fury of outraged mercy. A moan\nfrom Estelle stung her, and she leaned forward the better to catch the\nmusic of the mob’s distant shriek. Silence for full five minutes; then a\nsound like that which bursts from the throats of the bloodhounds as they\nbury their fangs in their quarry. She gave a faint scream, covered her\nface. “Oh, spare him! Spare him!” she cried. And she sank to the floor in\na faint, for she knew that Arden Wilmot was dead.",
        "Adelaide took Estelle’s store until Estelle came back to it, her surface\ncalm like the smooth river that hides in its tortured bosom the\ndeep-plunged rapids below the falls. The day after Estelle’s return\nAdelaide began to study architecture at the university; soon she was made\nan instructor, with the dean delighted and not a little mystified by her\nenergy and enthusiasm. Yet the matter was simple and natural: she had\nemerged from her baptism of blood and fire–a woman; at last she had\nlearned what in life is not worth while; she was ready to learn what it\nhas to offer that is worth while–the sole source of the joys that have\nno reaction, of the content that is founded upon the rock.",
        "Eight specialists, including Romney, of New York and Saltonstal, of\nChicago, had given Charles Whitney their verdicts on why he was weak and\nlethargic. In essential details these diagnoses differed as widely as\nopinions always differ where no one knows, or can know, and so everyone\nis free to please his own fancy in choosing a cloak for his ignorance.\nSome of the doctors declared kidneys sound but liver suspicious; others\nexonerated liver but condemned one or both kidneys; others viewed kidneys\nand liver with equal pessimism; still others put those organs aside and\nshook their heads and unlimbered their Latin at spleen and pancreas. In\none respect, however, the eight narrowed to two groups. “Let’s figure it\nout trial-balance fashion,” said Whitney to his private secretary, Vagen.\n\"Five, including two-thousand-dollar Romney, say I ’may go soon.’ Three,\nincluding our one-thousand-dollar neighbor, Saltonstal, say I am ’in no\nimmediate danger.’ But what the Romneys mean by ’soon,’ and what the\nSaltonstals mean by ’immediate,’ none of the eight says.”",
        "“But they all say that ’with proper care’–” began Vagen, with the faith\nof the little in the pretentious.",
        "“So they do! So they do!” interrupted Whitney, whom life had taught not\nto measure wisdom by profession of it, nor yet by repute for it. And he\nwent on in a drowsy drawl, significantly different from his wonted rather\nexplosive method of speech: “But does any of ’em say what ’proper care’\nis? Each gives his opinion. Eight opinions, each different and each\ncautioning me against the kind of ’care’ prescribed by the other seven.\nAnd I paid six thousand dollars!” A cynical smile played round his\nthin-lipped, sensual, selfish mouth.",
        "“Sixty-three hundred,” corrected Vagen. He never missed this sort of\nchance to impress his master with his passion for accuracy.",
        "“Sixty-three, then. I’d better have given you the money to blow in on\nyour fliers on wheat and pork.”",
        "At this Vagen looked much depressed. It was his first intimation that his\nchief knew about his private life. “I hope, sir, nobody has been\npoisoning your mind against me,” said he. “I court the fullest\ninvestigation. I have been honest–”",
        "“Of course, of course,” replied Whitney. “There never was a man as timid\nas you are that wasn’t honest. What a shallow world it is! How often envy\nand cowardice pass for virtue!”",
        "“I often say, sir,” replied Vagen, with intent to soothe and flatter,\n\"there ain’t one man in ten million that wouldn’t have done the things\nyou’ve done if they’d had the brains and the nerve.”",
        "“And pray what are the ’things I’ve done’?” inquired Whitney. But the\nflame of irritation was so feeble that it died down before his words were\nout. “I’m going down to Saint X to see old Schulze,” he drawled on.\n\"Schulze knows more than any of ’em–and ain’t afraid to say when he\ndon’t know.” A slow, somewhat sardonic smile. “That’s why he’s unknown.\nWhat can a wise man, who insists on showing that he’s wise, expect in a\nworld of damn fools?” A long silence during which the uncomfortable Vagen\nhad the consolation of seeing in that haggard, baggy, pasty-white face\nthat his master’s thoughts were serving him much worse than mere\ndiscomfort. Then Whitney spoke again: “Yes, I’m going to Saint X. I’m\ngoing home to–”",
        "He did not finish; he could not speak the word of finality. Vagen saw the\nlook in his pale, blue-green eyes, saw that the great financier knew he\nwould never again fling his terrible nets broadcast for vast hauls of\ngolden fish, knew his days were numbered and that the number was small.\nBut, instead of this making him feel sympathetic and equal toward his\nmaster, thus unmasked as mere galvanized clay, it filled him with greater\nawe; for, to the Vagens, Death seems to wear a special costume and walk\nwith grander step to summon the rich and the high.",
        "“Yes, I’ll go–this very afternoon,” said Whitney more loudly, turning\nhis face toward the door through which came a faint feminine\nrustling–the froufrou of the finest, softest silk and finest,\nsoftest linen.",
        "He looked attentively at his wife as she crossed the threshold–looked\nwith eyes that saw mercilessly but indifferently, the eyes of those who\nare out of the game of life, out for good and all, and so care nothing\nabout it. He noted in her figure–in its solidity, its settledness–the\nsigns of age the beauty doctors were still almost successful in keeping\nout of that masklike face which was their creation rather than nature’s;\nhe noted the rough-looking red of that hair whose thinness was not\naltogether concealed despite the elaborate care with which it was\narranged to give the impression of careless abundance. He noted her\nhands; his eyes did not linger there, for the hands had the wrinkles and\nhollows and age marks which but for art would have been in the face, and\nthey gave him a feeling–he could not have defined it, but it made him\nshudder. His eyes rested again upon her face, with an expression of pity\nthat was slightly satirical. This struggle of hers seemed so petty and\nsilly to him now; how could any human being think any other fact\nimportant when the Great Fact hung from birth threateningly over all?",
        "“You feel worse to-day, dear?” said she, in the tones that sound\ncarefully attuned to create an impression of sympathy. Hers had now\nbecome the mechanically saccharine voice which sardonic time ultimately\nfastens upon the professionally sympathetic to make them known and mocked\nof all, even of the vainest seekers after sympathy.",
        "“On the contrary, I feel better,” he drawled, eyes half-shut. “No pain at\nall. But–horribly weak, as if I were going to faint in a minute or\ntwo–and I don’t give a damn for anything.” There was a personal fling\nin that last word, an insinuation that he knew her state of mind toward\nhim, and reciprocated.",
        "“Well, to-morrow Janet and her baby will be here,” said Mrs. Whitney, and\nher soothing tones seemed to stimulate him by irritation. “Then we’ll all\ngo down to Saint X together, if you still wish it.”",
        "“Don’t take that tone with me, I tell you!” he said with some energy in\nhis drawl. ’Don’t talk to me as if you were hanging over my deathbed\nlying to me about my going to live!” And he closed his eyes, and his\nbreath made his parted, languid lips flutter.",
        "“Mr. Vagen,” said Matilda, in her tone of sweet graciousness, “may I\ntrouble you to go and–”",
        "“Go to the devil, Vagen,” said Charles, starting up again that slow\nstream of fainting words and sentences. “Anywhere to get you out of the\nroom so you won’t fill the flapping ears of your friends with gossip\nabout Whitney and his wife. Though why she should send you out I can’t\nunderstand. If you and the servants don’t hear what’s going on, you make\nup and tattle worse than what really happens.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney gave Vagen a look of sweet resignation and Vagen responded\nwith an expression which said: “I understand. He is very ill. He is not\nresponsible. I admire your ladylike patience.” As Whitney’s eyes were\nclosed he missed this byplay.",
        "“Here, Vagen–before you go,” he drawled, waving a weary hand toward the\ntable at his elbow. “Here’s a check for ten thousand. You don’t deserve\nit, for you’ve used your position to try to get rich on the sly. But\ninasmuch as I was ’on to’ you, and dropped hints that made you lose, I’ve\nno hard feelings. Then, too, you did no worse than any other would have\ndone in your place. A man’s as good, and as bad, as he has the chance to\nbe. So take it. I’ve not made my will yet, and as I may not be able to, I\ngive you the money now. You’ll find the check in this top drawer, and\nsome other checks for the people near me. I suppose they’ll expect\nsomething–I’ve got ’em into the habit of it. Take ’em and run along and\nsend ’em off right away.”",
        "Vagen muttered inarticulate thanks. In fact, the check was making small\nimpression on him, or the revelation that his chief had eyes as keen for\nwhat was going on under his nose as for the great movements in the big\nfield. He could think only of that terrifying weakness, that significant\ngarrulousness.",
        "When Vagen was out of the way, Charles repeated: “I’m going this\nafternoon.” His listless eyes were gazing vacantly at the carved rosewood\nceiling. His hands–the hands of a corpse–looked horribly like sheathed,\ncrumpled claws in the gold silk cuffs of his dark-blue dressing gown. His\nnose, protruding from his sunken cheeks, seemed not like a huge beak, but\nindeed a beak.",
        "“But Janet–” began Mrs. Whitney, thinking as she spoke that he surely\nwould “not be spared to us much longer.”",
        "“Janet can follow–or stay here–or–I don’t care what she does,” droned\nWhitney. “Do you suppose I’m thinking about anybody but myself now? Would\nyou, if you were in my fix. I should say,” he amended cynically, ’willyou, when you’re in my fix?”",
        "“Charles!” exclaimed Matilda.",
        "Whitney’s smile checked her. “I’m not a fool,” he rambled on. “Do you\nsuppose I haven’t seen what was going on? Do you suppose I don’t know\nall of you wish I was out of it? Yes, out of it. And you needn’t bother\nto put on that shocked look; it doesn’t fool me. I used to say: ’I’ll\nbe generous with my family and give ’em more than they’d have if I was\ngone.’ ’No children waiting round eager for me to pass off,’ said I,\n’so that they can divide up my fortune.’ I’ve said that often and\noften. And I’ve acted on it. And I’ve raised up two as pampered,\nselfish children as ever lived. And now–The last seven months I’ve\nbeen losing money hand over fist. Everything I’ve gone into has turned\nout bad. I’m down to about half what I had a year ago–maybe less than\nhalf. And you and Ross–and no doubt that marchioness ex-daughter of\nmine–all know it. And you’re afraid if I live on, I’ll lose more,\nmaybe everything. Do you deny it?”",
        "Matilda was unable to speak. She had known he was less rich; but\nhalf!–\"maybe less!” The cuirass of steel, whalebone, kid, and linen\nwhich molded her body to a fashionable figure seemed to be closing in on\nher heart and lungs with a stifling clutch.",
        "“No, you don’t deny it. You couldn’t,” Whitney drawled on. “And so my\n’indulgent father’ damned foolishness ends just where I might have known\nit’d end. We’ve brought up the children to love money and show off,\ninstead of to love us and character and self-respect–God forgive me!”",
        "The room was profoundly silent: Charles thinking drowsily, yet vividly,\ntoo, of his life; Matilda burning in anguish over the lost half, or more,\nof the fortune–and Charles had always been secretive about his wealth,\nso she didn’t know how much the fortune was a year ago and couldn’t judge\nwhether much or little was left! Enough to uphold her social position? Or\nonly enough to keep her barely clear of the “middle class”?",
        "Soon Whitney’s voice broke in upon her torments. “I’ve been thinking a\ngreat deal, this last week, about Hiram Ranger.”",
        "Matilda, startled, gave him a wild look. “Charles!” she exclaimed.",
        "“Exactly,” said Whitney, a gleam of enjoyment in his dull eyes.",
        "In fact, ever since Hiram’s death his colossal figure had often dominated\nthe thoughts of Charles and Matilda Whitney. The will had set Charles to\nobserving, to seeing; it had set Matilda to speculating on the\npossibilities of her own husband’s stealthy relentlessness. At these\ndefinite, dreadful words of his, her vague alarms burst into a deafening\nchorus, jangling and clanging in her very ears.",
        "“Arthur Ranger,” continued Whitney, languid and absent, “has got out of\nthe beaten track of business–”",
        "“Yes; look at Hiram’s children!” urged Matilda. “Everybody that is\nanybody is down on Arthur. See what his wife has brought him to, with her\ncrazy, upsetting ideas! They tell me a good many of the best people in\nSaint X hardly speak to him. Yes, Charles, look at Hiram’s doings.”",
        "“Thanks to Hiram–what he inherited from Hiram and what Hiram had the\ngood sense not to let him inherit–he has become a somebody. He’s doing\nthings, and the fact that they aren’t just the kind of things I like\ndoesn’t make me fool enough to underestimate them or him. Success is the\ntest, and in his line he’s a success.”",
        "“If it hadn’t been for his wife he’d not have done much,” said\nMatilda sourly.",
        "“You’ve lived long enough, I’d think, to have learned not to say such\nshallow things,” drawled he. “Of course, he has learned from her–don’t\neverybody have to learn somewhere? Where a man learns is nothing; the\nimportant thing is his capacity to learn. If a man’s got the capacity to\nlearn, he’ll learn, he’ll become somebody. If he hasn’t, then no man nor\nno woman can teach him. No, my dear, you may be sure that anybody who\namounts to anything has got it in himself. And Arthur Ranger is a credit\nto any father. He’s becoming famous–the papers are full of what he’s\naccomplishing. And he’s respected, honest, able, with a wife that loves\nhim. Would he have been anybody if his father had left him the money that\nwould have compelled him to be a fool? As for the girl, she’s got a showy\nstreak in her–she’s your regular American woman of nowadays–the kind of\ndaughter your sort of mother and my sort of damn-fool father breed up.\nBut Del’s mother wasn’t like you, Mattie, and she hadn’t a fool father\nlike me, so she’s married to a young fellow that’s already doing big\nthings, in his line–and a good line his is, a better line than trimming\ndollars and donkeys. Our Jenny–Jane that used to be–We’ve sold her to a\nFrenchman, and she’s sold herself to the devil. Hiram’s daughter–God\nforgive us, Matilda, for what we’ve done to Janet.” All this, including\nthat last devout appeal, in the manner of a spectator of a scene at which\nhe is taking a last, indifferent, backward glance as he is leaving.",
        "His wife’s brain was too busy making plans and tearing them up to follow\nhis monotonous garrulity except in a general way. He waited in vain for\nher to defend her daughter and herself.",
        "“As for Ross,” he went on, “he’s keen and quick enough. He’s got\ntogether quite a fortune of his own–and he’ll hold on to it and get\nmore. It’s easy enough to make money if you’ve got money–and ain’t\ntoo finicky about the look and the smell of the dollars before you\ngulp ’em down. Your Ross has a good strong stomach that way–as good\nas his father’s–and mother’s. But–He ain’t exactly the man I used to\npicture as I was wheeling him up and down the street in his baby\ncarriage in Saint X.”",
        "That vulgar reminiscence seemed to be the signal for which Matilda was\nwaiting. “Charles Whitney,” she said, “you and I have brought up our\nchildren to take their proper place in our aristocracy of wealth and\nbirth and breeding. And I know you’re not going to undo what we’ve done,\nand done well.”",
        "“That’s your ’bossy’ tone, Mattie,” he drawled, his desire to talk\ngetting a fresh excuse for indulging itself. “I guess this is a good\ntime to let you into a secret. You’ve thought you ran me ever since we\nwere engaged. That delusion of yours nearly lost you the chance to lead\nthese thirty years of wedded bliss with me. If you hadn’t happened to\nmake me jealous and afraid the one man I used to envy in those days\nwould get you–I laughed the other day when he was appointed postmaster\nat Indianapolis–However, I did marry you, and did let you imagine you\nwore the pants. It seemed to amuse you, and it certainly amused\nme–though not in the same way. Now I want you to look back and think\nhard. You can’t remember a single time that what you bossed me to do was\never done. I was always fond of playing tricks and pulling secret wires,\nand I did a lot of it in making you think you were bossing me when you\nwere really being bossed.”",
        "It was all Mrs. Whitney could do to keep her mind on how sick he was, and\nhow imperative it was not to get him out of humor. “I never meant to try\nto influence you, Charles,” she said, “except as anyone tries to help\nthose about one. And certainly you’ve been the one that has put us all in\nour present position. That’s why it distressed me for you even to talk of\nundoing your work.”",
        "Whitney smiled satirically, mysteriously. “I’ll do what I think best,\"\nwas all he replied. And presently he added, “though I don’t feel like\ndoing anything. It seems to me I don’t care what happens, or whether I\nlive–or–don’t. I’ll go to Saint X. I’m just about strong enough to\nstand the trip–and have Schulze come out to Point Helen this evening.”",
        "“Why not save your strength and have him come here?” urged Matilda.",
        "“He wouldn’t,” replied her husband. “Last time I saw him he looked me\nover and said: ’Champagne. If you don’t stop it you won’t live. Don’t\ncome here again unless you cut out that poison.’ But I never could resist\nchampagne. So I told myself he was an old crank, and found a great doctor\nI could hire to agree with me. No use to send for Schulze to come all\nthis distance. I might even have to go to his office if I was at Saint X.\nHe won’t go to see anybody who’s able to move about. ’As they want me,\nlet ’em come to me, just as I’d go to them if I wanted them,’ he says.\n’The air they get on the way is part of the cure.’ Besides, he and I had\na quarrel. He was talking his nonsense against religion, and I said\nsomething, and he implied I wasn’t as straight in business as I should\nbe–quoted something about ’He that hasteth to be rich shall not be\ninnocent,’ and one thing led to another, and finally he said, with that\nugly jeer of his: ’You pious bandits are lucky to have a forgiving God to\ngo to. Now we poor devils have only our self-respect, and it never\nforgives anything.’” Whitney laughed, reflected, laughed again. “Yes, I\nmust see Schulze. Maybe–Anyhow, I’m going to Saint X–going home, or as\nnear home as anything my money has left me.”",
        "He drowsed off. She sat watching him–the great beak, the bulging\nforehead, the thin, cruel lips; and everywhere in the garden of\nartificial flowers which formed the surface of her nature, hiding its\nreality even from herself, there appeared the poisonous snakes of hateful\nthoughts to shoot their fangs and hiss at him. She shrank and shuddered;\nyet–\"It’s altogether his own fault that I feel this way toward him as he\nlies dying,” she said to herself, resorting to human nature’s unfailing,\nuniversally sought comforter in all trying circumstances–self-excuse.\n\"He always was cold and hard. He has become a monster. And even in his\nbest days he wasn’t worthy to have such a woman as I am. And now he is\nthinking of cheating me–and will do it–unless God prevents him.”",
        "He drowsed on, more asleep than awake, not even rousing when they put him\nto bed. He did not go to Saint X that day. But he did go later–went to\nlie in state in the corridor of the splendid hall he had given Tecumseh;\nto be gaped at by thousands who could not see that they were viewing a\nfew pounds of molded clay, so busy were their imaginations with the vast\nfortune it was supposed he left; to be preached over, the sermon by Dr.\nHargrave, who believed in him–and so, in estimating the man as\ndistinguished from what the system he lived under had made of him,\nperhaps came nearer the truth than those who talked only of the facts of\nhis public career–his piracy, his bushwhacking, his gambling with the\nmarked cards and loaded dice of “high finance\"; to be buried in the old\nCedar Grove Cemetery, with an imposing monument presently over him,\nbefore it fresh flowers every day for a year–the Marchioness of St.\nBerthè contracted with a florist to attend to that.",
        "Four days after the funeral Janet sent a servant down to Adelaide and to\nMrs. Ranger with notes begging them to come to Point Helen for lunch.\n\"We are lonely and so dreary,” she wrote Adelaide. “We want you–need\nyou.” Only one answer was possible, and at half-past twelve they set out\nin Mrs. Ranger’s carriage. As they drove away from the Villa d’Orsay Mrs.\nRanger said: “When does Mrs. Dorsey allow to come home?”",
        "“Not for two years more,” replied Del.",
        "Ellen’s expression suggested that she was debating whether or not to\nspeak some thought which she feared Del might regard as meddlesome. “When\nyou finally do have to get out,” she said presently, “it’ll be like\ngiving up your own home, won’t it?”",
        "“No,” said Del. “I hate the place!” A pause, then: “I wrote Mrs. Dorsey\nyesterday that we wouldn’t stay but three months longer–not in any\ncircumstances.”",
        "The old woman’s face brightened. “I’m mighty glad of that,” she said\nheartily. “Then, you’ll have a home of your own at last.”",
        "“Not exactly,” was Del’s reply, in a curious tone. “The fact is, I’m\ngoing to live with Dr. Hargrave.”",
        "Ellen showed her astonishment. “And old Martha Skeffington!”",
        "“She’s not so difficult, once you get to know her,” replied Del. “I find\nthat everything depends on the point of view you take in looking at\npeople. I’ve been getting better acquainted with Dory’s aunt the last few\nweeks. I think she has begun to like me. We’ll get along.”",
        "“Don’t you think you’d better wait till Dory gets back?”",
        "“No,” said Adelaide firmly, a look in her eyes which made her mother say\nto herself: “There’s the Ranger in her.”",
        "They drove in silence awhile; then Del, with an effort which brought a\nbright color to her cheeks, began: “I want to tell you, mother, that I\nwent to Judge Torrey this morning, and made over to you the income\nfather left me.”",
        "“Whatever did you do that for?” cried Ellen, turning in the seat to\nstare at her daughter through her glasses.",
        "“I promised Dory I would. I’ve spent some of the money–about fifteen\nhundred dollars–You see, the house was more expensive than I thought.\nBut everything’s paid up now.”",
        "“I don’t need it, and don’t want it,” said Ellen. “And I won’t take it!”",
        "“I promised Dory I would–before we were married. He thinks I’ve done it.\nI’ve let him think so. And–lately–I’ve been having a sort of house\ncleaning–straightening things up–and I straightened that up, too.”",
        "Ellen Ranger understood. A long pause, during which she looked lovingly\nat her daughter’s beautiful face. At last she said: “No, there don’t seem\nto be no other way out of it.” Then, anxiously, “You ain’t written Dory\nwhat you’ve done?”",
        "“No,” replied Del. “Not yet.”",
        "“Not never!” exclaimed her mother. “That’s one of the things a body\nmustn’t ever tell anyone. You did wrong; you’ve done right–and it’s all\nsettled and over. He’d probably understand if you told him. But he’d\nnever quite trust you the same again–that’s human nature.”",
        "“But you’d trust me,” objected Del.",
        "“I’m older’n Dory,” replied her mother; “and, besides, I ain’t your\nhusband. There’s no end of husbands and wives that get into hot water\nthrough telling, where it don’t do any earthly good and makes the other\none uneasy and unhappy.”",
        "Adelaide reflected. “It is better not to tell him,” she concluded.",
        "Ellen was relieved. “That’s common sense,” said she. “And you can’t use\ntoo much common sense in marriage. The woman’s got to have it, for the\nmen never do where women are concerned.” She reflected a few minutes,\nthen, after a keen glance at her daughter and away, she said with an\nappearance of impersonality that evidenced diplomatic skill of no mean\norder: “And there’s this habit the women are getting nowadays of always\npeeping into their heads and hearts to see what’s going on. How can they\nexpect the cake to bake right if they’re first at the fire door, then at\nthe oven door, openin’ and shuttin’ ’em, peepin’ and pokin’ and\ntastin’–that’s what I’d like to know.”",
        "Adelaide looked at her mother’s apparently unconscious face in surprise\nand admiration. “What a sensible, wonderful woman you are, Ellen Ranger!\"\nshe exclaimed, giving her mother the sisterly name she always gave her\nwhen she felt a particular delight in the bond between them. And half to\nherself, yet so that her mother heard, she added: “And what a fool your\ndaughter has been!”",
        "“Nobody’s born wise,” said Ellen, “and mighty few takes the trouble\nto learn.”",
        "At Point Helen the mourning livery of the lodge keeper and of the hall\nservants prepared Ellen and her daughter for the correct and elegant\nhabiliments of woe in which Matilda and her son and daughter were garbed.\nIf Whitney had died before he began to lose his fortune, and while his\nfamily were in a good humor with him because of his careless generosity,\nor, rather, indifference to extravagance, he would have been mourned as\nsincerely as it is possible for human beings to mourn one by whose death\nthey are to profit enormously in title to the material possessions they\nhave been trained to esteem above all else in the world. As it was, those\nlast few months of anxiety–Mrs. Whitney worrying lest her luxury and\nsocial leadership should be passing, Ross exasperated by the daily\nstruggle to dissuade his father from fatuous enterprises–had changed\nWhitney’s death from a grief to a relief. However, “appearances\"\nconstrained Ross to a decent show of sorrow, compelled Mrs. Whitney to a\nstill stronger exhibit. Janet, who in far-away France had not been\ntouched by the financial anxieties, felt a genuine grief that gave her an\nadmirable stimulus to her efflorescent oversoul. She had “prepared for\nthe worst,” had brought from Paris a marvelous mourning wardrobe–dresses\nand hats and jewelry that set off her delicate loveliness as it had never\nbeen set off before. She made of herself an embodiment, an apotheosis,\nrather, of poetic woe–and so, roused to emulation her mother’s passion\nfor pose. Ross had refused to gratify them even to the extent of taking a\nspectator’s part in their refined theatricals. The coming of Mrs. Ranger\nand Adelaide gave them an audience other than servile; they proceeded to\nstrive to rise to the opportunity. The result of this struggle between\nmother and daughter was a spectacle so painful that even Ellen,\ndetermined to see only sincerity, found it impossible not to suspect a\ngrief that could find so much and such language in which to vent itself.\nShe fancied she appreciated why Ross eyed his mother and sister with\nunconcealed hostility and spoke almost harshly when they compelled him to\nbreak his silence.",
        "Adelaide hardly gave the two women a thought. She was surprised to find\nthat she was looking at Ross and thinking of him quite calmly and most\ncritically. His face seemed to her trivial, with a selfishness that more\nthan suggested meanness, the eyes looking out from a mind which\nhabitually entertained ideas not worth a real man’s while. What was the\nmatter with him–\"or with me?” What is he thinking about? Why is he\nlooking so mean and petty? Why had he no longer the least physical\nattraction for her? Why did her intense emotions of a few brief weeks\nago seem as vague as an unimportant occurrence of many years ago? What\nhad broken the spell? She could not answer her own puzzled questions;\nshe simply knew that it was so, that any idea that she did, or ever\ncould, love Ross Whitney was gone, and gone forever. “It’s so,” she\nthought. “What’s the difference why? Shall I never learn to let the\nstove doors alone?”",
        "As soon as lunch was over Matilda took Ellen to her boudoir and Ross went\naway, leaving Janet and Adelaide to walk up and down the shaded west\nterrace with its vast outlook upon the sinuous river and the hills. To\ndraw Janet from the painful theatricals, she took advantage of a casual\nquestion about the lynching, and went into the details of that red\nevening as she had not with anyone. It was now almost two months into the\npast; but all Saint X was still feverish from it, and she herself had\nonly begun again to have unhaunted and unbroken sleep. While she was\nrelating Janet forgot herself; but when the story was told–all of it\nexcept Adelaide’s own part; that she entirely omitted–Janet went back to\nher personal point of view. “A beautiful love story!” she exclaimed. “And\nright here in prosaic Saint X!”",
        "“Is it Saint X that is prosaic,” said Adelaide, “or is it we, in failing\nto see the truth about familiar things?”",
        "“Perhaps,” replied Janet, in the tone that means “not at all.” To her a\nthrill of emotion or a throb of pain felt by a titled person differed\nfrom the same sensation in an untitled person as a bar of supernal or\ninfernal music differs from the whistling of a farm boy on his way to\ngather the eggs; if the title was royal–Janet wept when an empress died\nof a cancer and talked of her “heroism” for weeks.",
        "“Of course,” she went on musingly, to Adelaide, “it was very beautiful\nfor Lorry and Estelle to love each other. Still, I can’t help feeling\nthat–At least, I can understand Arden Wilmot’s rage. After all, Estelle\nstepped out of her class; didn’t she, Del?”",
        "“Yes,” said Del, not recognizing the remark as one she herself might have\nmade not many months before. “Both she and Lorry stepped out of their\nclasses, and into the class where there is no class, but only just men\nand women, hearts and hands and brains.” She checked herself just in time\nto refrain from adding, “the class our fathers and mothers belonged in.”",
        "Janet did not inquire into the mystery of this. “And Estelle has gone to\nlive with poor Lorry’s mother!” said she. “How noble and touching! Such\nbeautiful self-sacrifice!”",
        "“Why self-sacrifice?” asked Del, irritated. “She couldn’t possibly go\nhome, could she? And she is fond of Lorry’s mother.”",
        "“Yes, of course. No doubt she’s a dear, lovely old woman. But–a\nwasherwoman, and constant, daily contact–and not as lady and servant,\nbut on what must be, after all, a sort of equality–” Janet finished her\nsentence with a ladylike look.",
        "Adelaide burned with the resentment of the new convert. “A woman who\nbrought into the world and brought up such a son as Lorry was,” said she,\n\"needn’t yield to anybody.” Then the silliness of arguing such a matter\nwith Madame la Marquise de Saint Berthè came over her. “You and I don’t\nlook at life from the same standpoint, Janet,” she added, smiling. “You\nsee, you’re a lady, and I’m not–any more.”",
        "“Oh, yes, you are,” Janet, the devoid of the sense of humor, hastened to\nassure her earnestly. “You know we in France don’t feel as they do in\nAmerica, that one gets or loses caste when one gets or loses money.\nBesides, Dory is in a profession that is quite aristocratic, and those\nlectures he delivered at Göttingen are really talked about everywhere on\nthe other side.”",
        "But Adelaide refused to be consoled. “No, I’m not a lady–not what you’d\ncall a lady, even as a Frenchwoman.”",
        "“Oh, but I’m a good American!” Janet protested, suddenly prudent and\nrushing into the pretenses our transplanted and acclimatized sisters are\ncareful to make when talking with us of the land whence comes their sole\nclaim to foreign aristocratic consideration–their income. “I’m really\nquite famous for my Americanism. I’ve done a great deal toward\nestablishing our ambassador at Paris in the best society. Coming from a\nrepublic and to a republic that isn’t recognized by our set in France, he\nwas having a hard time, though he and his wife are all right at home. Now\nthat there are more gentlemen in authority at Washington, our diplomats\nare of a much better class than they used to be. Everyone over there says\nso. Of course, you–that is we, are gradually becoming civilized and\nbuilding up an aristocracy.”",
        "“Yes, I suppose so,” said Adelaide, feeling that she must change the\nsubject or show her exasperation, yet unable to find any subject which\nJanet would not adorn with refined and cultured views. “Isn’t Ross,\nthere, looking for you?”",
        "He had just rushed from the house, his face, his manner violently\nagitated. As he saw Adelaide looking at him, he folded and put in his\npocket a letter which seemed to be the cause of his agitation. When the\ntwo young women came to where he was standing, he joined them and walked\nup and down with them, his sister, between him and Del, doing all the\ntalking. Out of the corner of her eye Del saw that his gaze was bent\nsavagely upon the ground and that his struggle for self-control was still\non. At the first opportunity she said: “I must get mother. We’ll have to\nbe going.”",
        "“Oh, no, not yet,” urged Janet, sincerity strong in her affected accents.\nDel felt that the sister, for some reason, as strongly wished not to be\nleft alone with the brother as the brother wished to be left alone with\nthe sister. In confirmation of this, Janet went on to say: “Anyhow, Ross\nwill tell your mother.”",
        "Ross scowled at his sister, made a hesitating, reluctant movement toward\nthe steps; just then Matilda and Ellen appeared. Adelaide saw that her\nmother had succeeded in getting through Matilda’s crust of sham and in\ntouch with her heart. At sight of her son Mrs. Whitney’s softened\ncountenance changed–hardened, Adelaide thought–and she said to him\neagerly: “Any news, any letters?”",
        "“This,” answered Ross explosively. He jerked the letter from his pocket,\ngave it to his mother.",
        "“You’ll excuse me–Ellen–Adelaide,” said Matilda, as she unfolded the\npaper with ringers that trembled. “This is very important.” Silence, as\nshe read, her eager glance leaping along the lines. Her expression became\nterrible; she burst out in a voice that was both anger and despair: “No\nwill! He wasn’t just trying to torment me when he said he hadn’t made\none. No will! Nothing but the draft of a scheme to leave everything to\nTecumseh–there’s your Hiram’s work, Ellen!”",
        "Adelaide’s gentle pressure on her mother’s arm was unnecessary; it was\ntoo evident that Matilda, beside herself, could not be held responsible\nfor anything she said. There was no pretense, no “oversoul” in her\nemotion now. She was as different from the Matilda of the luncheon table\nas the swollen and guttered face of woe in real life is different from\nthe graceful tragedy of the stage.",
        "“No will; what of it?” said Ellen gently. “It won’t make the least\ndifference. There’s just you and the children.”",
        "Adelaide, with clearer knowledge of certain dark phases of human nature\nand of the Whitney family, hastily interposed. “Yes, we must go,” said\nshe. “Good-by, Mrs. Whitney,” and she put out her hand.",
        "Mrs. Whitney neither saw nor heard. “Ellen!” she cried, her voice like\nher wild and haggard face. “What do you think of such a daughter as mine\nhere? Her father–”",
        "Janet, with eyes that dilated and contracted strangely, interrupted with\na sweet, deprecating, “Good-by, Adelaide dear. As I told you, I am\nleaving to-night–”",
        "There Ross laid his hand heavily on Janet’s shoulder. “You are going to\nstay, young lady,” he said between his teeth, “and hear what your mother\nhas to say about you.” His voice made Adelaide shudder, even before she\nsaw the black hate his eyes were hurling at his sister.",
        "“Yes, we want you, Ellen, and you, Del, to know her as she is,” Mrs.\nWhitney now raged on. “When she married, her father gave her a dowry,\nbought that title for her–paid as much as his whole fortune now amounts\nto. He did it solely because I begged him to. She knows the fight I had\nto win him over. And now that he’s gone, without making a will, she says\nshe’ll have her legal rights! Her legal rights! She’ll take\none-third of what he left. She’ll rob her brother and her mother!”",
        "Janet was plainly reminding herself that she must not forget that she was\na lady and a marchioness. In a manner in which quiet dignity was mingled\nwith a delicate soul’s shrinking from such brawling vulgarity as this\nthat was being forced upon her, she said, looking at Adelaide: “Papa\nnever intended that my dowry should be taken out of my share. It was a\npresent.” She looked calmly at her mother. “Just like your jewels,\nmamma.” She turned her clear, luminous eyes upon Ross. “Just like the\nopportunities he gave you to get your independent fortune.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney, trembling so that she could scarcely articulate, retorted:\n\"At the time he said, and I told you, it was to come out of your share.\nAnd how you thanked me and kissed me and–” She stretched toward Ellen\nher shaking old woman’s hands, made repellent by the contrasting splendor\nof magnificent black pearl rings. “O Ellen, Ellen!” she quavered. “I\nthink my heart will burst!”",
        "“You did say he said so,” replied Janet softly, “but he never\ntold me.”",
        "“You–you–” stuttered Ross, flinging out his arms at her in a\nparoxysm of fury.",
        "“I refuse to discuss this any further,” said Janet, drawing herself up\nin the full majesty of her black-robed figure and turning her long\nshapely back on Ross. “Mrs. Ranger, I’m sure you and Del realize that\nmother and Ross are terribly upset, and not–”",
        "“They’ll realize that you are a cheat, a vulture in the guise of woman!\"\ncried Mrs. Whitney. “Ellen, tell her what she is!”",
        "Mrs. Ranger, her eyes down and her face expressing her agonized\nembarrassment, contrived to say: “You mustn’t bring me in, Mattie.\nAdelaide and I must go.”",
        "“No, you shall hear!” shrieked Mrs. Whitney, barring the way. “All the\nworld shall hear how this treacherous, ingrate daughter of mine–oh, the\nsting of that!–how she purposes to steal, yes, steal four times as much\nof her father’s estate as Ross or I get. Four times as much! I can’t\nbelieve the law allows it! But whether it does or not, Janet Whitney,\nGod won’t allow it! God will hear my cry, my curse on you.”",
        "“My conscience is clear,” said Janet, and her gaze, spiritual, exalted,\npatient, showed that she spoke the truth, that her mother’s looks and\nwords left her quite unscathed.",
        "Ross vented a vicious, jeering laugh. His mother, overcome with the\nsense of helplessness, collapsed from rage to grief and tears. She\nturned to Mrs. Ranger. “Your Hiram was right,” she wailed, “and my\nCharles said so just before he went. Look at my daughter, Ellen. Look at\nmy son–for he, too, is robbing me. He has his own fortune that his dead\nfather made for him; yet he, too, talks about his legal rights. He\ndemands his full third!”",
        "Adelaide did not look at Ross; yet she was seeing him inside and out, the\ninside through the outside.",
        "“My heartless children!” sobbed Matilda. “I can’t believe that they are\nthe same I brought into the world and watched over and saw that they had\neverything. God forgive them–and me. Your Hiram was right. Money has\ndone it. Money has made monsters of them. And I–oh, how I am punished!”",
        "All this time Ellen and Adelaide had been gradually retreating, the\nWhitneys following them. When Mrs. Whitney at last opened wide the\ncasket of her woe and revealed Ross there, too, he wheeled on Adelaide\nwith a protesting, appealing look. He was confident that he was in the\nright, that his case was different from Janet’s; confident also that\nAdelaide would feel that in defending his rights he was also defending\nhers that were to be. But before Del there had risen the scene after the\nreading of her own father’s will. She recalled her rebellious thoughts,\nsaw again Arthur’s fine face distorted by evil passions, heard again her\nmother’s terrible, just words: “Don’t trample on your father’s grave,\nArthur Ranger! I’ll put you both out of the house! Go to the Whitneys,\nwhere you belong!” And then she saw Arthur as he now was, and herself\nthe wife of Dory Hargrave. And she for the first time realized, as we\nrealize things only when they have become an accepted and unshakable\nbasic part of our lives, what her father had done, what her father was.\nHiram had won his daughter.",
        "“We are going now,” said Ellen, coming from the stupor of shame and\nhorror into which this volcanic disgorging of the secret minds and hearts\nof the Whitneys had plunged her. And the expression she fixed first upon\nJanet, then upon Ross, then upon Matilda, killed any disposition they\nmight have had to try to detain her. As she and Adelaide went toward her\ncarriage, Ross followed. Walking beside Adelaide, he began to protest in\na low tone and with passionate appeal against the verdict he could not\nbut read in her face. “It isn’t fair, it isn’t just!” he pleaded.\n\"Adelaide, hear me! Don’t misjudge me. You know what your–your good\nopinion means to me.”",
        "She took her mother’s arm, and so drew farther away from him.",
        "“Forgive me,” he begged. “Janet put me out of my mind. It drove me mad to\nhave her rob–us.”",
        "At that “us” Adelaide fixed her gaze on his for an instant. And what he\nsaw in her eyes silenced him–silenced him on one subject forever.",
        "He left for Chicago without seeing either his sister or his mother\nagain. His impulse was to renounce to his mother his share of his\nfather’s estate. But one does not act hastily upon an impulse to give up\nnearly a million dollars. On reflection he decided against such\nexpensive and futile generosity. If it would gain him Adelaide–then,\nyes. But when it would gain him nothing but the applause of people who\nin the same circumstances would not have had even the impulse to forego\na million–\"Mother’s proper share will give her as much of an income as\na woman needs at her age and alone,” reasoned he. “Besides, she may\nmarry again. And I must not forget that but for her Janet would never\nhave got that dowry. She brought this upon herself. Her folly has cost\nme dearly enough. If I go away to live abroad or in New York–anywhere\nto be free of the Howlands–why I’ll need all I’ve got properly to\nestablish myself.”",
        "Janet and her baby left on a later train for the East. Before going she\ntried to see her mother. Her mother had wronged her in thought, had\nslandered her in word; but Janet forgave her and nobly wished her to have\nthe consolation of knowing it. Mrs. Whitney, however, prevented the\nexecution of this exalted purpose by refusing to answer the gentle\npersistent knocking and gentle appealing calls of “Mother, mother dear!\"\nat her locked boudoir door.",
        "Judge Torrey succeeded Whitney as chairman of the overseers of Tecumseh\nand in the vacant trusteeship of the Ranger bequest. Soon Dr. Hargrave,\ninsisting that he was too old for the labors of the presidency of such a\nhuge and varied institution as the university had become, was made\nhonorary president, and his son, still in Europe, was elected chairman of\nthe faculty. Toward the middle of a fine afternoon in early September Dr.\nHargrave and his daughter-in-law drove to the railway station in the\nancient and roomy phaeton which was to Saint X as much part of his\npersonality as the aureole of glistening white hair that framed his\nmajestic head, or as the great plaid shawl that had draped his big\nshoulders with their student stoop every winter day since anyone could\nremember. Despite his long exposure to the temptation to sink into the\nemasculate life of unapplied intellect, mere talker and writer, and to\nadopt that life’s flabby ideals, he had remained the man of ideas, the\nman of action. His learning was all but universal, yet he had the rugged,\ndirect vigor of the man of affairs. His was not the knowledge that\nenfeebles, but the knowledge that empowers. As his son, the new executive\nof the university–with the figure of a Greek athlete, with positive\ncharacter, will as well as intellect, stamped upon his young\nface–appeared in the crowd, the onlookers had the sense that a\n\"somebody” had arrived. Dory’s always was the air an active mind never\nfails to give; as Judge Torrey once said: “You’ve only got to look at him\nto see he’s the kind that does things, not the kind that tells how they\nused to be done or how they oughtn’t to be done.” Now there was in his\nface and bearing the subtly but surely distinguishing quality that comes\nonly with the strength a man gets when his fellows acknowledge his\nleadership, when he has seen the creations of his brain materialize in\nwork accomplished. Every successful man has this look, and shows it\naccording to his nature–the arrogant arrogantly; the well-balanced with\ntranquil unconsciousness.",
        "As he moved toward his father and Adelaide, her heart swelled with pride\nin him, with pride in her share in him. Ever since the sending of the\ncablegram to recall him, she had been wondering what she would feel at\nsight of him. Now she forgot all about her once-beloved self-analysis.\nShe was simply proud of him, enormously proud; other men seemed trivial\nbeside this personage. Also she was a little afraid; for, as their eyes\nmet, it seemed to her that his look of recognition and greeting was not\nso ardent as she was accustomed to associate with his features when\nturned toward her. But before she could be daunted by her misgiving it\nvanished; for he impetuously caught her in his arms and, utterly\nforgetting the onlookers, kissed her until every nerve in her body was\ntingling in the sweeping flame of that passion which his parting caress\nhad stirred to vague but troublesome restlessness. And she, too, forgot\nthe crowd, and shyly, proudly gave as well as received; so there began to\nvibrate between them the spark that clears brains and hearts of the fogs\nand vapors and keeps them clear. And it was not a problem in psychology\nthat was revealed to those admiring and envying spectators in the\nbrilliant September sunshine, but a man and a woman in love in the way\nthat has been “the way of a man with a maid” from the beginning; in love,\nand each looking worthy of the other’s love–he handsome in his blue\nserge, she beautiful in a light-brown fall dress with pale-gold facings,\nand the fluffy, feathery boa close round her fair young face.\nCivilization has changed methods, but not essentials; it is still not\nwhat goes on in the minds of a man and woman that counts, but what goes\non in their hearts and nerves.",
        "The old doctor did not in the least mind the momentary neglect of\nhimself. He had always assumed that his son and Del loved each other,\nthere being every reason why they should and no reason why they\nshouldn’t; he saw only the natural and the expected in this outburst\nwhich astonished and somewhat embarrassed them with the partial return of\nthe self-consciousness that had been their curse. He beamed on them from\neyes undimmed by half a century of toil, as bright under his shaggy white\nbrows as the first spring flowers among the snows. As soon as he had\nDory’s hand and his apparent attention, he said: “I hope you’ve been\ngetting your address ready on the train, as I suggested in my telegram.”",
        "“I’ve got it in my bag,” replied Dory.",
        "In the phaeton Del sat between them and drove. Dory forgot the honors he\nhad come home to receive; he had eyes and thoughts only for her, was\nimpatient to be alone with her, to reassure himself of the meaning of the\nblushes that tinted her smooth white skin and the shy glances that stole\ntoward him from the violet eyes under those long lashes of hers. Dr.\nHargrave resumed the subject that was to him paramount. “You see,\nTheodore, your steamer’s being nearly two days late brings you home just\na day before the installation. You’ll be delivering, your address at\neleven to-morrow morning.”",
        "“So I shall,” said Dory absently.",
        "“You say it’s ready. Hadn’t you better let me get it type-written for\nyou?”",
        "Dory opened the bag at his feet, gave his father a roll of paper. “Please\nlook it over, and make any changes you like.”",
        "Dr. Hargrave began the reading then and there. He had not finished the\nfirst paragraph when Dory interrupted with, “Why, Del, you’re passing\nour turning.”",
        "Del grew crimson. The doctor, without looking up or taking his mind off\nthe address, said: “Adelaide gave up Mrs. Dorsey’s house several weeks\nago. You are living with us.”",
        "Dory glanced at her quickly and away. She said nothing. “He’ll\nunderstand,” thought she–and she was right.",
        "Only those who have had experience of the older generation out West\nwould have suspected the pride, the affection, the delight hiding behind\nMartha Skeffington’s prim and formal welcome, or that it was not\nindifference but the unfailing instinct of a tender heart that made her\nsay, after a very few minutes: “Adelaide, don’t you think Dory’d like to\nlook at the rooms?”",
        "Del led the way, Dory several feet behind her–deliberately, lest he\nshould take that long, slender form of hers in his arms that he might\nagain feel her bosom swelling and fluttering against him, and her fine,\nthick, luminous hair caressing his temple and his cheek. Miss Skeffington\nhad given them the three large rooms on the second floor–the two Dory\nused to have and one more for Del. As he followed Del into the sitting\nroom he saw that there had been changes, but he could not note them. She\nwas not looking at him; she seemed to be in a dream, or walking with the\nslow deliberate steps one takes in an unfamiliar and perilous path.",
        "“That is still your bedroom,” said she, indicating one of the doors.\n\"A stationary stand has been put in. Perhaps you’d like to freshen\nup a bit.”",
        "“A stationary stand,” he repeated, as if somewhat dazed before this\npractical detail. “Yes–I think so.”",
        "She hesitated, went into her room, not quite closing the door behind her.\nHe stared at it with a baffled look. “And,” he was thinking, “I imagined\nI had trained myself to indifference.” An object near the window caught\nhis eye–a table at which he could work standing. He recalled that he had\nseen its like in a big furniture display at Paris when they were there\ntogether, and that he had said he would get one for himself some day.\nThis hint that there might be more than mere matter in those surroundings\nset his eyes to roving. That revolving bookcase by the desk, the circular\nkind he had always wanted, and in it the books he liked to have at\nhand–Montaigne and Don Quixote, Shakespeare and Shelley and Swinburne,\nthe Encyclopedia, the statistical yearbooks; on top, his favorites among\nthe magazines. And the desk itself–a huge spread of cleared surface–an\nenormous blotting pad, an ink well that was indeed a well–all just what\nhe had so often longed for as he sat cramped at little desks where an\nattempt to work meant overflow and chaos of books and papers. And that\nbig inlaid box–it was full of his favorite cigarettes; and the\ndrop-light, and the green shade for the eyes, and the row of pencils\nsharpened as he liked them–",
        "He knocked at her door. “Won’t you come out here a moment?” cried he,\nputting it in that form because he had never adventured her intimate\nthreshold.",
        "No answer, though the door was ajar and she must have heard.",
        "“Please come out here,” he repeated.",
        "A pause; then, in her voice, shy but resolute, the single word, “Come!”",
        "On the green oval within and opposite the entrance to the main campus of\nthe great university there is the colossal statue of a master workman.\nThe sculptor has done well. He does not merely show you the physical\nman–the mass, the strength, of bone and sinew and muscle; he reveals the\nman within–the big, courageous soul. Strangers often think this statue a\npersonation of the force which in a few brief generations has erected\nfrom a wilderness our vast and splendid America. And it is that; but to\nArthur and Adelaide, standing before it in a June twilight, long after\nthe events above chronicled, it is their father–Hiram.",
