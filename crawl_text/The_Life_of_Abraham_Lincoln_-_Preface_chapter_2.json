        "The question will naturally be raised, Why should there be another Life\nof Lincoln? This may be met by a counter question, Will there ever be a\ntime in the near future when there will not be another Life of\nLincoln? There is always a new class of students and a new enrolment of\ncitizens. Every year many thousands of young people pass from the\nGrammar to the High School grade of our public schools. Other thousands\nare growing up into manhood and womanhood. These are of a different\nconstituency from their fathers and grandfathers who remember the civil\nwar and were perhaps in it.",
        "“To the younger generation,” writes Carl Schurz, “Abraham Lincoln has\nalready become a half mythical figure, which, in the haze of historic\ndistance, grows to more and more heroic proportions, but also loses in\ndistinctness of outline and figure.” The last clause of this remark is\npainfully true. To the majority of people now living, his outline and\nfigure are dim and vague. There are to-day professors and presidents of\ncolleges, legislators of prominence, lawyers and judges, literary men,\nand successful business men, to whom Lincoln is a tradition. It cannot\nbe expected that a person born after the year (say) 1855, could\nremember Lincoln more than as a name. Such an one’s ideas are made up\nnot from his remembrance and appreciation of events as they occurred,\nbut from what he has read and heard about them in subsequent years.",
        "The great mine of information concerning the facts of Lincoln’s life\nis, and probably will always be, the History by his secretaries,\nNicolay and Hay. This is worthily supplemented by the splendid volumes\nof Miss Tarbell. There are other biographies of great value. Special\nmention should be made of the essay by Carl Schurz, which is classic.",
        "The author has consulted freely all the books on the subject he could\nlay his hands on. In this volume there is no attempt to write a history\nof the times in which Lincoln lived and worked. Such historical events\nas have been narrated were selected solely because they illustrated\nsome phase of the character of Lincoln. In this biography the single\npurpose has been to present the living man with such distinctness of\noutline that the reader may have a sort of feeling of being acquainted\nwith him. If the reader, finishing this volume, has a vivid realization\nof Lincoln as a man, the author will be fully repaid.",
        "To achieve this purpose in brief compass, much has been omitted. Some\nof the material omitted has probably been of a value fully equal to\nsome that has been inserted. This could not well be avoided. But if the\nreader shall here acquire interest enough in the subject to continue\nthe study of this great, good man, this little book will have served\nits purpose.",
