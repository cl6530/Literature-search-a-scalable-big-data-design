        "One fine summer’s day Earl Mar’s daughter went into the castle garden,\ndancing and tripping along. And as she played and sported she would\nstop from time to time to listen to the music of the birds. After a\nwhile as she sat under the shade of a green oak tree she looked up and\nspied a sprightly dove sitting high up on one of its branches. She\nlooked up and said: “Coo-my-dove, my dear, come down to me and I will\ngive you a golden cage. I’ll take you home and pet you well, as well\nas any bird of them all.” Scarcely had she said these words when the\ndove flew down from the branch and settled on her shoulder, nestling\nup against her neck while she smoothed its feathers. Then she took it\nhome to her own room.",
        "The day was done and the night came on and Earl Mar’s daughter was\nthinking of going to sleep when, turning round, she found at her side\na handsome young man. She was startled, for the door had been\nlocked for hours. But she was a brave girl and said: “What are you\ndoing here, young man, to come and startle me so? The door was barred\nthese hours ago; how ever did you come here?”",
        "“Hush! hush!” the young man whispered. “I was that cooing dove that\nyou coaxed from off the tree.”",
        "“But who are you then?” she said quite low; “and how came you to be\nchanged into that dear little bird?”",
        "“My name is Florentine, and my mother is a queen, and something more\nthan a queen, for she knows magic and spells, and because I would not\ndo as she wished she turned me into a dove by day, but at night her\nspells lose their power and I become a man again. To-day I crossed the\nsea and saw you for the first time and I was glad to be a bird that I\ncould come near you. Unless you love me, I shall never be happy more.”",
        "“But if I love you,” says she, “will you not fly away and leave me one\nof these fine days?”",
        "“Never, never,” said the prince; “be my wife and I’ll be yours for\never. By day a bird, by night a prince, I will always be by your side\nas a husband, dear.”",
        "So they were married in secret and lived happily in the castle and no\none knew that every night Coo-my-dove became Prince Florentine. And\nevery year a little son came to them as bonny as bonny could be. But\nas each son was born Prince Florentine carried the little thing away\non his back over the sea to where the queen his mother lived and left\nthe little one with her.",
        "Seven years passed thus and then a great trouble came to them. For the\nEarl Mar wished to marry his daughter to a noble of high degree who\ncame wooing her. Her father pressed her sore but she said: “Father\ndear, I do not wish to marry; I can be quite happy with Coo-my-dove\nhere.”",
        "Then her father got into a mighty rage and swore a great big oath, and\nsaid: “To-morrow, so sure as I live and eat, I’ll twist that birdie’s\nneck,” and out he stamped from her room.",
        "“Oh, oh!” said Coo-my-dove; “it’s time that I was away,” and so he\njumped upon the window-sill and in a moment was flying away. And he\nflew and he flew till he was over the deep, deep sea, and yet on he\nflew till he came to his mother’s castle. Now the queen his mother was\ntaking her walk abroad when she saw the pretty dove flying overhead\nand alighting on the castle walls.",
        "“Here, dancers come and dance your jigs,” she called, “and pipers,\npipe you well, for here’s my own Florentine, come back to me to stay\nfor he’s brought no bonny boy with him this time.”",
        "“No, mother,” said Florentine, “no dancers for me and no minstrels,\nfor my dear wife, the mother of my seven, boys, is to be wed to-\nmorrow, and sad’s the day for me.”",
        "“What can I do, my son?” said the queen, “tell me, and it shall be\ndone if my magic has power to do it.”",
        "“Well then, mother dear, turn the twenty-four dancers and pipers into\ntwenty-four grey herons, and let my seven sons become seven white\nswans, and let me be a goshawk and their leader.”",
        "“Alas! alas! my son,” she said, “that may not be; my magic reaches not\nso far. But perhaps my teacher, the spaewife of Ostree, may know\nbetter.” And away she hurries to the cave of Ostree, and after a while\ncomes out as white as white can be and muttering over some burning\nherbs she brought out of the cave. Suddenly Coo-my-dove changed into a\ngoshawk and around him flew twenty-four grey herons and above them\nflew seven cygnets.",
        "Without a word or a good-bye off they flew over the deep blue sea\nwhich was tossing and moaning. They flew and they flew till they\nswooped down on Earl Mar’s castle just as the wedding party were\nsetting out for the church. First came the men-at-arms and then the\nbridegroom’s friends, and then Earl Mar’s men, and then the\nbridegroom, and lastly, pale and beautiful, Earl Mar’s daughter\nherself. They moved down slowly to stately music till they came past\nthe trees on which the birds were settling. A word from Prince\nFlorentine, the goshawk, and they all rose into the air, herons\nbeneath, cygnets above, and goshawk circling above all. The weddineers\nwondered at the sight when, swoop! the herons were down among them\nscattering the men-at-arms. The swanlets took charge of the bride\nwhile the goshawk dashed down and tied the bridegroom to a tree. Then\nthe herons gathered themselves together into one feather bed and the\ncygnets placed their mother upon them, and suddenly they all rose in\nthe air bearing the bride away with them in safety towards Prince\nFlorentine’s home. Surely a wedding party was never so disturbed in\nthis world. What could the weddineers do? They saw their pretty bride\ncarried away and away till she and the herons and the swans and the\ngoshawk disappeared, and that very day Prince Florentine brought Earl\nMar’s daughter to the castle of the queen his mother, who took the\nspell off him and they lived happy ever afterwards.",
