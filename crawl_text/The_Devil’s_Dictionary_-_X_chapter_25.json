        "X in our alphabet being a needless letter has an added invincibility \nto the attacks of the spelling reformers, and like them, will \ndoubtless last as long as the language.  X is the sacred symbol of ten \ndollars, and in such words as Xmas, Xn, etc., stands for Christ, not, \nas is popular supposed, because it represents a cross, but because the \ncorresponding letter in the Greek alphabet is the initial of his name \n— Xristos.  If it represented a cross it would stand for St. \nAndrew, who “testified” upon one of that shape.  In the algebra of \npsychology x stands for Woman’s mind.  Words beginning with X are \nGrecian and will not be defined in this standard English dictionary.",
