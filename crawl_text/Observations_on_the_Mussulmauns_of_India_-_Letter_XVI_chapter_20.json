        "The various trades of a Native city in Hindoostaun are almost generally\ncarried on in the open air. The streets are narrow, and usually unpaved;\nthe dukhauns[1] (shops) small, with the whole front open towards the\nstreet; a tattie[2] of coarse grass forming an awning to shelter the\nshopkeeper and his goods from the weather. In the long lines of dukhauns\nthe open fronts exhibit to the view the manufacturer, the artisan, the\nvender, in every variety of useful and ornamental articles for general use\nand consumption. In one may be seen the naunbye[3] (bazaar cook) basting\nkeebaubs[3] over a charcoal fire on the ground with one hand, and beating\noff the flies with a bunch of date-leaves in the other; beside him may be\nseen assistant cooks kneading dough for sheermaul[3] or other bread, or\nsuperintending sundry kettles and cauldrons of currie, pillau, matunjun,[3]\n&c., whilst others are equally active in preparing platters and trays, in\norder to forward the delicacies at the appointed hour to some great\nassembly.",
        "The shop adjoining may probably be occupied by a butcher, his meat exposed\nfor sale in little lean morsels carefully separated from every vestige of\nfat[4] or skin; the butcher’s assistant is occupied in chopping up the\ncoarser pieces of lean meat into mince meat.[5] Such shops as these are\nactually in a state of siege by the flies; there is, however, no remedy\nfor the butcher but patience; his customers always wash their meat before\nit is cooked, so he never fails to sell even with all these disadvantages.\nBut it is well for the venders of more delicate articles when neither of\nthese fly-attracting emporiums are next door neighbours, or immediately\nopposite; yet if it even should be so, the merchant will bear with\nequanimity an evil he cannot control, and persuade his customers for\nsilver shoes or other ornamental articles, that if they are not tarnished\na fly spit or two cannot lessen their value.",
        "The very next door to a working goldsmith may be occupied by a weaver of\nmuslin; the first with his furnace and crucible, the latter with his loom,\nin constant employ. Then the snake-hookha manufacturer,[6] opposed to a\nmixer of tobacco, aiding each other’s trade in their separate articles.\nThe makers and venders of punkahs of all sorts and sizes, children’s toys,\nof earth, wood, or lakh; milk and cream shops; jewellers, mercers,\ndruggists selling tea, with other medicinal herbs. The bunyah[7]\n(corn-dealer) with large open baskets of sugar and flour, whose whiteness\nresembles each other so narrowly, that he is sometimes suspected of mixing\nthe two articles by mistake, when certain sediments in sherbet indicate\nadulterated sugar.",
        "It would take me too long were I to attempt enumerating all the varieties\nexposed in a Native street of shops. It may be presumed these people make\nno mystery of their several arts in manufacturing, by their choice of\nsituation for carrying on their trades. The confectioner, for instance,\nprepares his dainties in despite of dust and flies, and pass by at what\nhour of the day you please, his stoves are hot, and the sugar simmering\nwith ghee sends forth a savour to the air, inviting only to those who\ndelight in the delicacies he prepares in countless varieties.",
        "The most singular exhibitions in these cities are the several shroffs[8]\n(money-changers, or bankers), dispersed in every public bazaar, or line of\nshops. These men, who are chiefly Hindoos, and whose credit may perhaps\nextend throughout the continent of Asia for any reasonable amount, take\ntheir station in this humble line of buildings, having on their right and\nleft, piles of copper coins and cowries.[9] These shroffs are occupied the\nwhole day in exchanging pice for rupees or rupees for pice, selling or\nbuying gold mohurs, and examining rupees; and to all such demands upon him\nhe is entitled to exact a regulated per centage, about half a pice in a\nrupee. Small as this sum may seem yet the profits produce a handsome\nremuneration for his day’s attention, as many thousands of rupees may have\npassed under his critical eye for examination, it being a common practice,\nboth with shopkeepers and individuals, to send their rupees to the shroff\nfor his inspection, always fearing imposition from the passers of base\ncoin. These shroffs transact remittances to any part of India by\nhoondies,[10] which are equivalent to our bills of exchange, and on which\nthe usual demand is two and a half per cent at ninety days, if required\nfor any distant station.",
        "The European order is here completely reversed, for the shopkeeper sits\nwhilst the purchasers are compelled to stand. The bazaar merchant is\nseated on the floor of his dukhaun, near enough to the open front to\nenable him to transact business with his customers, who, one and all,\nstand in the street to examine the goods and to be served; let the weather\nbe bad or good, none are admitted within the threshold of the dukhaun. In\nmost places the shops are small, and look crowded with the articles for\nsale, and those where manufactories are carried on have not space to spare\nto their customers.",
        "Very few gentlemen condescend to make their own purchases; they generally\nemploy their confidential domestic to go to market for them; and with the\nladies their women servants are deputed. In rich families it is an office\nof great trust, as they expend large sums and might be much imposed upon\nwere their servants faithless. The servants always claim dustoor[11]\n(custom) from the shopkeepers, of one pice for every rupee they lay out;\nand when the merchants are sent for to the houses with their goods, the\nprincipal servant in the family is sure to exact his dustoor from the\nmerchant; and this is often produced only after a war of words between the\ncrafty and the thrifty.",
        "The diversity of cries from those who hawk about their goods and wares in\nstreets and roadways, is a feature in the general economy of the Natives\nnot to be overlooked in my brief description of their habits. The\nfollowing list of daily announcements by the several sonorous claimants on\nthe public attention, may not be unacceptable with their translated\naccompaniments.",
        "’Seepie wallah deelie sukha’[12] (Moist or dry cuppers).–Moist and dry\ncupping is performed both by men and women; the latter are most in request.\nThey carry their instruments about with them, and traverse all parts of\nthe city. The dry cupping is effected by a buffalo’s horn and resorted to\nby patients suffering under rheumatic pains, and often in cases of fever,\nwhen to lose blood is either inconvenient on account of the moon’s age, or\nnot desirable by reason of the complaint or constitution of the patient.",
        "’Jonk, or keerah luggarny wallie’[13] (The woman with leeches).–Women\nwith leeches attend to apply the required remedy, and are allowed to take\naway the leeches after they have done their office. These women by a\nparticular pressure on the leech oblige it to disgorge the blood, when\nthey immediately place it in fresh water; by this practice the leeches\ncontinue healthy, and may be brought to use again the following day if\nrequired.",
        "’Kaan sarf kerna wallah’[14] (Ear-cleaner).–The cleansing of ears is\nchiefly performed by men, who collecting this article make great profits\nfrom the sale of it, independent of the sums obtained from their employers.\nIt is the chief ingredient in use for intoxicating elephants previous to\nthe furious contests so often described as the amusement of Native Courts.",
        "’Goatah chandnie bickhow’[15] (Sell your old silver trimmings).–The\nseveral articles of silver trimmings are invariably manufactured of the\npurest metal without any alloy, and when they have served their first\npurposes the old silver procures its weight in current rupees.",
        "’Tale kee archah wallah’[16] (Oil pickles).–The method of pickling in oil\nis of all others in most request with the common people, who eat the\ngreasy substance as a relish to their bread and dhall. The mustard-oil\nused in the preparation of this dainty is often preferred to ghee in\ncurries.",
        "The better sort of people prefer water pickle, which is made in most\nfamilies during the hot and dry weather by a simple method; exposure to\nthe sun being the chemical process to the parboiled carrots, turnips,\nradishes, &c., immersed in boiling water, with red pepper, green ginger,\nmustard-seed, and garlic. The flavour of this water pickle is superior to\nany other acid, and possesses the property of purifying the blood.",
        "’Mittie wallah’[17] (Man with sweetmeats).–The many varieties of\nsweetmeats, or rather confectionery, in general estimation with the\nnatives, are chiefly composed of sugar and ghee, prepared in countless\nways, with occasional additions of cocoa-nut, pistachias, cardimuns,\nrose-water, &c., and constantly hawked about the streets on trays by men.",
        "’Kallonie wallah’[18] (Man with toys).–Toys of every kind, of which no\ncountry in the world I suppose exhibits greater variety, in wood, lakh,\nuberuck[19] (tulk), paper, bamboo, clay, &c., are constantly cried in the\nstreets and roadways of a Native city.",
        "’Punkah wallah’[20] (Vender of fans).–The punkahs are of all descriptions\nin general use, their shape and material varying with taste and\ncircumstances, the general form resembling hand-screens: they are made for\ncommon use of date-leaf, platted as the common mats are; some are formed\nof a single leaf from the tor[21]-tree, large or small, the largest would\ncover a tolerable sized round table; many have painted figures and devices,\nand from their lightness may be waved by children without much labour. I\nhave seen very pretty punkahs made of sweet-scented flowers over a frame\nof bamboo. This, however, is a temporary indulgence, as the flowers soon\nlose their fragrance.",
        "’Turkaaree’, ’Mayvour’[22] (The first is vegetables; the last,\nfruit).–Vegetables of every kind and many sorts of fruits are carried\nabout by men and women, who describe the name and quality of the articles\nthey have to sell. It would occupy too large a space to enumerate here the\nseveral productions, indigenous and foreign, of the vegetable world in\nIndia. The Natives in their cookery, use every kind of vegetable and fruit\nin its unripe state. Two pounds of meat is in general all that is required\nto form a meal for twenty people, and with this they will cook several\ndishes by addition of as many different sorts of vegetables.",
        "Herbs, or green leaves, are always denominated saag,[23] these are\nproduced at all seasons of the year, in many varieties; the more\nsubstantial vegetables, as potatoes, turnips, carrots, &c., are called\nturkaaree.",
        "The red and green spinach is brought to the market throughout the year,\nand a rich-flavoured sorrel, so delicious in curries, is cultivated in\nmost months. Green peas, or, indeed, vegetables in general, are never\nserved in the plain way in which we see them at our tables, but always in\nstews or curries. The green mango is used invariably to flavour their\nseveral dishes, and, at the proper season, they are peeled, cut, and dried\nfor the year’s consumption. They dislike the acid of the lemon in their\nstews, which is never resorted to when the green mango or tamarind can be\nprocured.",
        "The fruits of India in general estimation with the Natives are the mango\nand the melon. Mangoes are luscious and enticing fruit; the Natives eat\nthem to an excess when they have been some hours soaked in water, which,\nthey say, takes away from the fruit its detrimental quality; without this\npreparatory precaution those who indulge in a feast of mango are subject\nto fevers, and an increase of prickly heat, (a fiery irritable rash, which\nfew persons are exempt from, more or less, in the hot weather); even biles,\nwhich equally prevail, are less troublesome to those persons who are\ncareful only to eat mangoes that have been well soaked in water. The\nNatives have a practice, which is common among all classes, and therefore\nworthy the notice of foreigners, of drinking milk immediately after eating\nmangoes. It should be remembered that they never eat their fruit after\ndinner, nor do they at any time indulge in wine, spirits, or beer.",
        "The mango in appearance and flavour has no resemblance to any of the\nfruits of England; they vary in weight from half an ounce to half a seer,\nnearly a pound; the skin is smooth, tough, and of the thickness of leather,\nstrongly impregnated with a flavour of turpentine; the colour, when ripe,\nis grass green, or yellow in many shades, with occasional tinges and\nstreaks of bright red; the pulp is as juicy as our wall-fruit, and the\nkernel protected by a hard shell, to which fine strong silky fibres are\nfirmly attached. The kernel of the mango is of a hot and rather offensive\nflavour; the poor people, however, collect it, and when dried grind it\ninto flour for bread, which is more wholesome than agreeable; in seasons\nof scarcity, however, it is a useful addition to the then scanty means of\nthe lower orders of the people. The flavour of the fruit itself differs so\nmuch, that no description can be given of the taste of a mango–even the\nfruit of one tree vary in their flavour. A tope (orchard) of mango-trees\nis a little fortune to the possessor, and when in bloom a luxurious resort\nto the lovers of Nature.",
        "The melon is cultivated in fields with great ease and little labour, due\ncare always being taken to water the plants in their early growth. The\nvarieties are countless, but the kind most esteemed, and known only in the\nUpper Provinces, are called chitlahs,[24] from their being spotted green\non a surface of bright yellow; the skin is smooth and of the thickness of\nthat of an apple; the fruit weighing from half-a-pound to three pounds.\nThe flavour may be compared to our finest peaches, partaking of the same\nmoist quality, and literally melting in the mouth.",
        "The juice of the melon makes a delicious cider; I once tried the\nexperiment with success. The Natives being prohibited from the use of all\nfermented liquors, I was induced by that consideration to be satisfied\nwith the one experiment; but with persons who are differently situated the\npractice might be pursued with very little trouble, and a rich beverage\nproduced, much more healthy than the usual arrack that is now distilled,\nto the deterioration of the health and morals of the several classes under\nthe British rule, who are prone to indulge in the exhilarating draughts of\nfermented liquors.",
        "At present my list of the indigenous vegetables of India must be short; so\ngreat, however, is the variety in Hindoostaun, both in their quality and\nproperties, and so many are the benefits derived from their several uses\nin this wonderful country, that at some future time I may be induced to\nfollow, with humility, in the path trodden by the more scientific\nnaturalists who have laboured to enrich the minds of mankind by their\nresearches.",
        "The natives are herbalists in their medical practice. The properties of\nminerals are chiefly studied with the view to become the lucky discoverer\nof the means of transmuting metals; seldom with reference to their\nmedicinal qualities. Quicksilver, however, in its unchanged state, is\nsometimes taken to renew the constitution.[25] One gentleman, whom I well\nknew, commenced with a single grain, increasing the number progressively,\nuntil his daily close was the contents of a large table-spoon; he\ncertainly appeared to have benefited by the practice, for his appetite and\nspirits were those of a man at thirty, when he had counted eighty years.",
        "’Muchullee’[26] (Fish).–Fish of several kinds are caught in the rivers\nand tanks; the flavour I can hardly describe, for, since I knew the\npractice of the Hindoos of throwing their dead bodies into the rivers the\nidea of fish as an article of food was too revolting to my taste. The\nNatives, however, have none of these qualms; even the Hindoos enjoy a\ncurrie of fish as a real delicacy, although it may be presumed some of\ntheir friends or neighbours have aided that identical fish in becoming a\ndelicacy for the table.",
        "There are some kinds of fish forbidden by the Mussulmaun law, which are,\nof course, never brought to their kitchens, as the eel, or any other fish\nhaving a smooth skin;[27] all sorts of shell-fish are likewise prohibited\nby their code. Those fish which have scales are the only sort allowable to\nthem for food.",
        "The rooey[28] is a large fish, and in Native families is much admired for\nits rich flavour; the size is about that of a salmon, the shape that of a\ncarp; the flesh is white, and not unlike the silver mullet. The scales of\nthis fish are extremely useful; which, on a tolerable sized fish, are in\nmany parts as large as a crown-piece, and of a substance firmer than horn.\nIt is not uncommon to see a suit of armour formed of these scales, which,\nthey affirm, will turn the edge of the best metal, and from its lightness,\ncompared with the chain armour, more advantageous to the wearer, though\nthe appearance is not so agreeable to the eye.",
        "’Chirryah wallah’[29] (Bird-man).–The bird-catcher cries his live birds\nfresh caught from the jungles: they seldom remain long on hand. I have\nbefore described the practice of letting off the birds, in cases of\nillness, as propitiatory sacrifices. The Natives take delight in petting\ntalking-birds, minas and parrots particularly; and the bull-bull,[30] the\nsubzah,[31] and many others for their sweet songs.",
        "The numberless varieties of birds I have seen in India, together with\ntheir qualities, plumage, and habits, would occupy too much of my time at\npresent to describe. I will here only remark a few of the most singular as\nthey appeared to me. The butcher-bird,[32] so called from its habit, is\nknown to live on seeds; yet it caters for the mina and others of the\ncarnivorous feathered family, by collecting grasshoppers, which they\nconvey in the beak to the thorny bushes, and there fix them on sharp\nthorns, (some of which are nearly two inches in length), and would almost\nseem to have been formed by Nature for this use only. The mina[33] follows\nhis little friend’s flight as if in the full assurance of the feast\nprepared for him.",
        "The coel[34] is a small black bird, of extreme beauty in make and plumage;\nthis bird’s note is the harbinger of rain, and although one of the\nsmallest of the feathered race, it is heard at a considerable distance.[35]\nThe coel’s food is simply the suction from the petals of sweet-scented\nflowers.",
        "The lollah,[36] known to many by the name of haverdewatt, is a beautiful\nlittle creature, about one-third the size of a hedge sparrow. The great\nnovelty in this pretty bird is, that the spots of white on its brown\nplumage change to a deep red at the approach of the rainy season; the\nNatives keep them by dozens in cages with a religious veneration, as their\nsingle note describes one of the terms in use to express an attribute of\nthe Almighty.",
        "But enough–I must hasten to finish my list of popular cries by the Indian\npedlars, who roar out their merchandize and their calling to the inmates\nof dwellings bounded by high walls, whose principal views of the works of\nNature and art are thus aided by those casual criers of the day.",
        "’Artush-baajie’[37] (Fireworks).–Fireworks are considered here to be very\nwell made, and the Native style much extolled by foreigners; every year\nthey add some fresh novelty to their amusing pastime. They are hawked\nabout at certain seasons, particularly at the Holie[38] (a festival of the\nHindoos,) and the Shubh-burraat[39] of the Mussulmauns. Saltpetre being\nvery reasonable, fireworks are sold for a small price. Most of the\ningenious young men exercise their inventive powers to produce novelties\nin fireworks for any great season of rejoicing in their families.",
        "’Chubbaynee’[40] (Parched corn).–The corn of which we have occasionally\nspecimens in English gardens, known by the name of Indian corn, is here\nused as a sort of intermediate meal, particularly amongst the labouring\nclasses, who cook but once a day, and that when the day’s toil is over.\nThis corn is placed in a sort of furnace with sand, and kept constantly\nmoved about. By this process it is rendered as white as magnesia, crisp,\nand of a sweet flavour; a hungry man could not eat more than half-a-pound\nof this corn at once, yet it is not as nutritious as barley or wheat. I\nhave never heard that the Natives use this corn for making bread.",
        "’Tumaushbeen’[41] (Wonder-workers).–This call announces the rope-dancers\nand sleight-of-hand company; eating fire, swallowing pen-knives, spinning\ncoloured yarn through the nose, tricks with cups and balls, and all the\narts of the well-known jugglers. I have seen both men and women attached\nto these travelling companies perform extraordinary feats of agility and\nskill, also most surprising vaultings, by the aid of bamboos, and a\nfrightful method of whirling round on the top of a pole or mast. This pole\nis from twenty to thirty feet high; on the top is a swivel hook, which\nfastens to a loop in a small piece of wood tied fast to the middle of the\nperformer, who climbs the pole without any assistance, and catches the\nhook to the loop; at first he swings himself round very gently, but\nincreasing gradually in swiftness, until the velocity is equal to that of\na wheel set in motion by steam. This feat is sometimes continued for ten\nor fifteen minutes together, when his strength does not fail him; but it\nis too frightful a performance to give pleasure to a feeling audience.",
        "’Samp-wallah’[42] (Snake-catchers).–These men blow a shrill pipe in\naddition to calling out the honourable profession of snake-catcher. I\nfancy it is all pretence with these fellows; if they catch a snake on the\npremises, it is probably one they have let loose secretly, and which they\nhave tutored to come and go at the signal given: they profess to draw\nsnakes from their hiding-place, and make a good living by duping the\ncredulous.",
        "The best proof I can offer of the impositions practised by these men on\nthe weakness and credulity of their neighbours, may be conveyed in the\nfollowing anecdote, with which I have been favoured by a very intelligent\nMussulmaun gentleman, on whom the cheat was attempted during my residence\nin his neighbourhood at Lucknow.",
        "’Moonshie Sahib,[43] as he is familiarly called by his friends, was absent\nfrom home on a certain day, during which period his wife and family\nfancied they heard the frightful sound of a snake, apparently as if it was\nvery near to them in the compound (court-yard) of the zeenahnah. They were\ntoo much alarmed to venture from the hall to the compound to satisfy\nthemselves or take steps to destroy the intruder if actually there. Whilst\nin this state of mental torture it happened (as they thought very\nfortunately) that a snake-catcher’s shrill pipe was heard at no great\ndistance, to whom a servant was sent; and when the ladies had shut\nthemselves up securely in their purdahed apartment, the men servants were\ndesired to introduce the samp-wallahs into the compound, to search for and\nsecure this enemy to their repose.",
        "’The snake-catcher made, to all appearance, a very minute scrutiny into\nevery corner or aperture of the compound, as if in search of the reptile’s\nretreat; and at last a moderate sized snake was seen moving across the\nopen space in an opposite direction to the spot they were intent on\nexamining. The greatest possible satisfaction was of course expressed by\nthe whole of the servants and slaves assembled; the lady of the house was\nmore than gratified at the reported success of “the charmers” and sent\nproofs of her gratitude to the men in a sum of money, proportioned to her\nsense of the service rendered on the occasion; the head samp-wallah placed\nthe snake in his basket, (they always carry a covered basket about with\nthem) and they departed well satisfied with the profits of this day’s\nemployment.",
        "’The Moonshie says, he returned home soon after, and listened to his\nwife’s account of the event of the morning, and her warm commendation of\nthe skilful samp-wallahs; but although the servants confirmed all the lady\nhad told her husband of the snake-charmers’ diligence, still he could not\nbut believe that these idle fellows had practised an imposition on his\nunwary lady by their pretended powers in charming the snake. But here it\nrested for the time; he could not decide without an opportunity of\nwitnessing the samp-wallahs at their employment, which he resolved to do\nthe next convenient opportunity.",
        "’As might have been anticipated, the very same snake-catcher and his\nattendant returned to the Moonshie’s gateway a very few days after their\nformer success; Moonshie Sahib was at home, and, concealing his real\nintentions, he gave orders that the two men should be admitted; on their\nentrance, he said to them, “You say you can catch snakes; now, friends, if\nany of the same family remain of which you caught one the other day in\nthis compound, I beg you will have the civility to draw them out from\ntheir hiding-places.\"[44]",
        "’The Moonshie watched the fellows narrowly, that they might not have a\nchance of escaping detection, if it was, as he had always suspected, that\nthe snakes are first let loose by the men, who pretend to attract them\nfrom their hiding-places. The two men being bare-headed, and in a state of\nalmost perfect nudity (the common usage of the very lowest class of Hindoo\nlabourers), wearing only a small wrapper which could not contain, he\nthought, the least of this class of reptiles, he felt certain there could\nnot now be any deception.",
        "’The samp-wallah and his assistant, pretending to search every hole and\ncrevice of the compound, seemed busy and anxious in their employment,\nwhich occupied them for a long time without success. Tired at last with\nthe labour, the men sat down on the ground to rest; the pipe was resorted\nto, with which they pretend to attract the snake; this was, however,\nsounded again and again, without the desired effect.",
        "’From the apparent impossibility of any cheat being practised on him, the\nMoonshie rather relaxed in his strict observance of the men: he had turned\nhis back but for an instant only, when the two fellows burst out in an\necstasy of delight, exclaiming, “They are come! they are come!\"–and on\nthe Moonshie turning quickly round, he was not a little staggered to find\nthree small snakes on the ground, at no great distance from the men, who,\nhe was convinced, had not moved from the place. They seemed to have no\ndread of the reptiles, and accounted for it by saying they were\ninvulnerable to the snakes’ venom; the creatures were then fearlessly\nseized one by one by the men, and finally deposited in their basket.",
        "’\"They appear very tame,” thought the Moonshie, as he observed the men’s\nactions: “I am outwitted at last, I believe, with all my boasted vigilance;\nbut I will yet endeavour to find them out.–Friend,” said he aloud, “here\nis your reward,” holding the promised money towards the principal; “take\nit, and away with you both; the snakes are mine, and I shall not allow you\nto remove them hence.”",
        "’\"Why, Sahib,” replied the man, “what will you do with the creatures? they\ncannot be worth your keeping; besides, it is the dustoor[45] (custom); we\nalways have the snakes we catch for our perquisite.\"–\"It is of no\nconsequence to you, friend, how I may dispose of the snakes,” said the\nMoonshie; “I am to suppose they have been bred in my house, and having\ndone no injury to my people, I may be allowed to have respect for their\nforbearance; at any rate, I am not disposed to part with these guests, who\ncould have injured me if they would.”",
        "’The principal samp-wallah, perceiving it was the Moonshie’s intention to\ndetain the snakes, in a perfect agony of distress for the loss he was\nlikely to sustain, then commenced by expostulation, ending with threats\nand abuse, to induce the Moonshie to give them up; who, for his part, kept\nhis temper within bounds, having resolved in his own mind not to be\noutwitted a second time; the fellow’s insolence and impertinent speeches\nwere, therefore, neither chastised nor resented. The samp-wallah strove to\nwrest the basket from the Moonshie’s strong grasp, without succeeding; and\nwhen he found his duplicity was so completely exposed, he altered his\ncourse, and commenced by entreaties and supplications, confessing at last,\nwith all humility, that the reptiles were his own well-instructed snakes\nthat he had let loose to catch again at pleasure. Then appealing to the\nMoonshie’s well-known charitable temper, besought him that the snakes\nmight be restored, as by their aid he earned his precarious livelihood.",
        "’\"That they are yours, I cannot doubt,” replied the Moonshie, “and,\ntherefore, my conscience will not allow me to detain them from you; but\nthe promised reward I of course keep back. Your insolence and duplicity\ndeserve chastisement, nevertheless I promise to forgive you, if you will\nexplain to me how you managed to introduce these snakes.”",
        "’The man, thankful that he should escape without further loss or\npunishment, showed the harmless snakes, which, it appears, had been\ndeprived of their fangs and poison, and were so well instructed and docile,\nthat they obeyed their keeper as readily as the best-tutored domestic\nanimal. They coiled up their supple bodies into the smallest compass\npossible, and allowed their keeper to deposit them each in a separate bag\nof calico, which was fastened under his wrapper, where it would have been\nimpossible, the Moonshie declares, for the quickest eye to discover that\nanything was secreted.’",
        "’Sickley ghur’[46] (Cutler and knife-grinder).–These most useful artisans\nare in great request, polishing articles of rusty steel, giving a new edge\nto the knives, scissors, razors, or swords of their employer, in a\nmasterly manner, for a very small price.",
        "’Dhie cuttie’[47] (Sour curds).–This article is in great request by\nscientific cooks, who use it in many of their dainty dishes. The method of\nmaking sour curd is peculiarly Indian: it is made of good sweet milk, by\nsome secret process which I could never acquire, and in a few hours the\nwhole is coagulated to a curd of a sharp acidity, that renders it equally\nuseful with other acids in flavouring their curries. The Natives use it\nwith pepper, pounded green ginger, and the shreds of pumpkins or radishes,\nas a relish to their savoury dishes, in lieu of chatnee; it is considered\ncooling in its quality, and delicious as an accompaniment to their\nfavourite viands.",
        "’Mullie’[48] (Clotted cream).–-This article is much esteemed by the\nNatives. I was anxious to know how clotted cream could be procured at\nseasons when milk from the cow would be sour in a few hours, and am told\nthat the milk when brought in fresh from the dairy is placed over the fire\nin large iron skillets; the skin (as we call it on boiled milk) is taken\noff with a skimmer, and placed in a basket, which allows all the milk to\nbe drained from it; the skin again engendered on the surface is taken off\nin the same way, and so they continue, watching and skimming until the\nmilk has nearly boiled away. This collection of skin is the clotted cream\nof Hindoostaun.",
        "’Mukhun’[49] (Butter).–Butter is very partially used by the Natives; they\nuse ghee, which is a sort of clarified butter, chiefly produced from the\nbuffalo’s milk. The method of obtaining butter in India is singular to a\nEuropean. The milk is made warm over the fire, then poured into a large\nearthen jar, and allowed to stand for a few hours. A piece of bamboo is\nsplit at the bottom, and four small pieces of wood inserted as stretchers\nto these splits. A leather strap is twisted over the middle of the bamboo,\nand the butter-maker with this keeps the bamboo in constant motion; the\nparticles of butter swimming at the top are taken off and thrown into\nwater, and the process of churning is resumed; this method continues until\nby the quantity collected, these nice judges have ascertained there is no\nmore butter remaining in the milk. When the butter is to be sold, it is\nbeaten up into round balls out of the water. When ghee is intended to be\nmade, the butter is simmered over a slow fire for a given time, and poured\ninto the ghee pot, which perhaps may contain the produce of the week\nbefore they convey it to the market for sale; in this state the greasy\nsubstance will keep good for months, but in its natural state, as butter,\nthe second day it is offensive to have it in the room, much less to be\nused as an article of food.",
        "’Burruff wallah’[50] (The man with ice).–The ice is usually carried about\nin the evening, and considered a great indulgence by the Natives. The\nice-men bring round both iced creams, and sherbet ices, in many varieties;\nsome flavoured with oranges, pomegranates, pine-apple, rose-water, &c.",
        "They can produce ices at any season, by saltpetre, which is here abundant\nand procured at a small price; but strange as it may appear, considering\nthe climate, we have regular collections of ice made in January, in most\nof the stations in the Upper Provinces, generally under the\nsuperintendence of an English gentleman, who condescends to be the\ncomptroller. The expenses are paid by subscribers, who, according to the\nvalue of their subscription, are entitled to a given quantity of ice, to\nbe conveyed by each person’s servant from the deposit an hour before\nday-break, in baskets made for the purpose well wadded with cotton and\nwoollen blankets; conveyed home, the basket is placed where neither air\nnor light can intrude. Zinc bottles, filled with pure water, are placed\nround the ice in the basket, and the water is thus cooled for the day’s\nsupply, an indulgence of great value to the sojourners in the East.",
        "The method of collecting ice is tedious and laborious, but where labour is\ncheap and the hands plenty the attempt has always been repaid by the\nadvantages. As the sun declines, the labourers commence their work; flat\nearthen platters are laid out, in exposed situations, in square\ndepartments, upon dried sugar-cane leaves very lightly spread, that the\nfrosty air may pass inside the platters. A small quantity of water is\npoured into the platter; as fast as they freeze their contents are\ncollected and conveyed, during the night, to the pit prepared for the\nreception of ice. The rising sun disperses the labourers with the ice, and\nthey seek their rest by day, and return again to their employ; as the lion,\nwhen the sun disappears, prowls out to seek his food from the bounty of\nhis Creator. The hoar frost seldom commences until the first of January,\nand lasts throughout that month.",
        "’Roshunie’[51] (Ink).–-Ink, that most useful auxiliary in rendering the\nthoughts of one mortal serviceable to his fellow-creatures through many\nages, is here an article of very simple manufacture. The composition is\nprepared from lampblack and gum-arabic; how it is made, I have yet to\nlearn.",
        "The ink of the Natives is not durable; with a wet sponge may be erased the\nlabour of a man’s life. They have not yet acquired the art of printing,[52]\nand as they still write with reeds instead of feathers, an ink, permanent\nas our own, is neither agreeable nor desirable.",
        "There is one beautiful trait in the habits of the Mussulmauns: when about\nto write they not only make the prayer which precedes every important\naction of their lives, but they dedicate the writing to God, by a\ncharacter on the first page, which, as in short-hand writing, implies the\nwhole sentence.[53] A man would be deemed heathenish amongst Mussulmauns,\nwho by neglect or accident omitted this mark on whatever subject he is\nabout to write.",
        "Another of their habits is equally praiseworthy:–out of reverence for\nGod’s holy name (always expressed in their letters) written paper to be\ndestroyed is first torn and then washed in water before the whole is\nscattered abroad; they would think it a sinful act to burn a piece of\npaper on which that Holy name has been inscribed. How often have I\nreflected whilst observing this praiseworthy feature in the character of a\ncomparatively unenlightened people, on the little respect paid to the\nsacred writings amongst a population who have had greater opportunities of\nacquiring wisdom and knowledge.[54]",
        "The culpable habit of chandlers in England is fresh in my memory, who\nwithout a scruple tear up Bibles and religious works to parcel out their\npounds of butter and bacon, without a feeling of remorse on the sacrilege\nthey have committed.",
        "How careless are children in their school-days of the sacred volume which\ncontains the word of God to His creatures. Such improper uses, I might say\nabuses, of that Holy Book, would draw upon them the censure of a people\nwho have not benefited by the contents, but who nevertheless respect the\nvolume purely because it speaks the word ’of that God whom they worship’.",
        "’Mayndhie’ (A shrub).–The mayndhie and its uses have been so fully\nexplained in the letters on Mahurrum, that I shall here merely remark,\nthat the shrub is of quick growth, nearly resembling the small-leafed\nmyrtle; the Natives make hedge-rows of it in their grounds, the blossom is\nvery simple, and the shrub itself hardy: the dye is permanent.",
        "’Sulmah.’[55]–A prepared permanent black dye, from antimony. This is used\nwith hair-pencils to the circle of the eye at the root of the eye-lashes\nby the Native ladies and often by gentlemen, and is deemed both of service\nto the sight and an ornament to the person. It certainly gives the\nappearance of large eyes, if there can be any beauty in altering the\nnatural countenance, which is an absurd idea, in my opinion. Nature is\nperfect in all her works; and whatever best accords with each feature of a\ncountenance I think she best determines; I am sure that no attempt to\ndisguise or alter Nature in the human face ever yet succeeded, independent\nof the presumption in venturing to improve that which in His wisdom, the\nCreator has deemed sufficient.",
        "It would occupy my pages beyond the limits I can conveniently spare to the\nsubject, were I to pursue remarks on the popular cries of a Native city to\ntheir fullest extent; scarcely any article that is vended at the bazaars,\nbut is also hawked about the streets. This is a measure of necessity\ngrowing out of the state of Mussulmaun society, by which the females are\nenabled to purchase at their own doors all that can be absolutely\nrequisite for domestic purposes, without the obligation of sending to the\nmarkets or the shops, when either not convenient, or not agreeable. And\nthe better to aid both purchasers and venders, these hawkers pronounce\ntheir several articles for sale, with voices that cannot fail to impress\nthe inhabitants enclosed within high walls, with a full knowledge of the\narticles proclaimed without need of interpreters.",
