        "[Footnote: Originally printed under the title of ’Truth versus\nTruthfulness,’ in the Journal of Philosophy.]",
        "My account of truth is purely logical and relates to its definition\nonly. I contend that you cannot tell what the WORD ’true’ MEANS,\nas applied to a statement, without invoking the CONCEPT OF THE\nSTATEMENTS WORKINGS.",
        "Assume, to fix our ideas, a universe composed of two things only:\nimperial Caesar dead and turned to clay, and me, saying\n’Caesar really existed.’ Most persons would naively deem truth to be\nthereby uttered, and say that by a sort of actio in distans my\nstatement had taken direct hold of the other fact.",
        "But have my words so certainly denoted THAT Caesar?–or so certainly\nconnoted HIS individual attributes? To fill out the complete measure\nof what the epithet ’true’ may ideally mean, my thought ought to\nbear a fully determinate and unambiguous ’one-to-one-relation’ to\nits own particular object. In the ultrasimple universe imagined the\nreference is uncertified. Were there two Caesars we shouldn’t know\nwhich was meant. The conditions of truth thus seem incomplete in\nthis universe of discourse so that it must be enlarged.",
        " Transcendentalists enlarge it by invoking an absolute mind which,\nas it owns all the facts, can sovereignly correlate them. If it\nintends that my statement SHALL refer to that identical Caesar, and\nthat the attributes I have in mind SHALL mean his attributes, that\nintention suffices to make the statement true.",
        " I, in turn, enlarge the universe by admitting finite intermediaries\nbetween the two original facts. Caesar HAD, and my statement HAS,\neffects; and if these effects in any way run together, a concrete\nmedium and bottom is provided for the determinate cognitive\nrelation, which, as a pure ACTIO IN DISTANS, seemed to float too\nvaguely and unintelligibly.",
        " The real Caesar, for example, wrote a manuscript of which I see a\nreal reprint, and say ’the Caesar I mean is the author of THAT.’\nThe workings of my thought thus determine both its denotative and\nits connotative significance more fully. It now defines itself as\nneither irrelevant to the real Caesar, nor false in what it suggests\nof him. The absolute mind, seeing me thus working towards Caesar\nthrough the cosmic intermediaries, might well say: ’Such workings\nonly specify in detail what I meant myself by the statement being\ntrue. I decree the cognitive relation between the two original facts\nto mean that just that kind of concrete chain of intermediaries\nexists or can exist.’",
        "But the chain involves facts prior to the statement the logical\nconditions of whose truth we are defining, and facts subsequent to\nit; and this circumstance, coupled with the vulgar employment of the\nterms truth and fact as synonyms, has laid my account open\nto misapprehension. ’How,’ it is confusedly asked, ’can Caesar’s\nexistence, a truth already 2000 years old, depend for its truth on\nanything about to happen now? How can my acknowledgment of it be\nmade true by the acknowledgment’s own effects? The effects may\nindeed confirm my belief, but the belief was made true already by\nthe fact that Caesar really did exist.’",
        "Well, be it so, for if there were no Caesar, there could, of course,\nbe no positive truth about him–but then distinguish between ’true’\nas being positively and completely so established, and ’true’ as\nbeing so only ’practically,’ elliptically, and by courtesy, in\nthe sense of not being positively irrelevant or UNtrue. Remember\nalso that Caesar’s having existed in fact may make a present\nstatement false or irrelevant as well as it may make it true, and\nthat in neither case does it itself have to alter. It being given,\nwhether truth, untruth, or irrelevancy shall be also given\ndepends on something coming from the statement itself. What\npragmatism contends for is that you cannot adequately DEFINE the\nsomething if you leave the notion of the statement’s functional\nworkings out of your account. Truth meaning agreement with reality,\nthe mode of the agreeing is a practical problem which the subjective\nterm of the relation alone can solve.",
        "Note. This paper was originally followed by a couple of\nparagraphs meant to conciliate the intellectualist opposition.\nSince you love the word ’true’ so, and since you despise so the\nconcrete working of our ideas, I said, keep the word ’truth’ for the\nsaltatory and incomprehensible relation you care so much for, and I\nwill say of thoughts that know their objects in an intelligible\nsense that they are ’truthful.’",
        "Like most offerings, this one has been spurned, so I revoke it,\nrepenting of my generosity. Professor Pratt, in his recent book,\ncalls any objective state of FACTS ’a truth,’ and uses the word\n’trueness’ in the sense of ’truth’ as proposed by me. Mr. Hawtrey\n(see below, page 281) uses ’correctness’ in the same sense. Apart\nfrom the general evil of ambiguous vocabularies, we may really\nforsake all hope, if the term ’truth’ is officially to lose its\nstatus as a property of our beliefs and opinions, and become\nrecognized as a technical synonym for ’fact.’",
