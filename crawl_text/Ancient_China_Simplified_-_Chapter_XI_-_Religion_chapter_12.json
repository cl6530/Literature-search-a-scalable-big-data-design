        "All through these five centuries of struggle, between the flight\nof the Emperor with the transfer of the metropolis in 771 B.C.,\nand the total destruction of the feudal system by the First August\nEmperor of Ts’in in 221 B.C., it is of supreme interest to note\nthat religion in our Western sense was not only non-existent\nthroughout China, but had not yet even been conceived of as an\nabstract notion; apart, that is to say, from government, public\nlaw, family law, and class ritual. No word for “religion” was\nknown to the language; the notion of Church or Temple served by a\npriestly caste had not entered men’s minds. Offences against “the\ngods” or “the spirits,” in a vague sense, were often spoken of;\nbut, on the other hand, too much belief in their power was\nregarded as superstition. “Sin” was only conceivable in the sense\nof infraction of nature’s general laws, as symbolized and\nspecialized by imperial commands; direct, or delegated to vassal\nprinces; in both cases as representatives, supreme or local, of\nHeaven, or of the Emperor Above, whose Son the dynastic central\nruler for the time being was figuratively supposed to be. No\nvassal prince ever presumed to style himself “Son of Heaven,\"\nthough nearly all the barbarous vassals called themselves “King\"\n(the only other title the Chou monarchs took) in their own\ndominions. “In the Heaven there can only be one Sun; on Earth\nthere can only be one Emperor\"; this was the maxim, and, ever\nsince the Chou conquest in 1122 B.C., the word “King” had done\nduty for the more ancient “Emperor,” which, in remote times had\napparently not been sharply distinguished in men’s minds from God,\nor the “Emperor on High.”",
        "Prayer was common enough, as we shall frequently see, and\nsacrifice was universal; in fact, the blood of a victim was almost\ninseparable from solemn function or record of any kind. But such\nideas as conscience, fear of God, mortal sin, repentance,\nabsolution, alms-giving, self-mortification, charity, sackcloth\nand ashes, devout piety, praise and glorification,–in a word,\nwhat the Jews, Christians, Mussulmans, and even Buddhists have\neach in turn conceived to be religious duty, had no well-defined\nexistence at all. There are some traces of local or barbarous gods\nin the semi-Turkish nation of Ts’in, before it was raised to the\nstatus of full feudal vassal; and also in the semi-Annamese nation\nof Ts’u (with its dependencies Wu and Yiieh); but the orthodox\nChinese proper of those times never had any religion such as we\nnow conceive it, whatever notions their remote ancestors may have\nconceived.",
        "Notwithstanding this, the minds of the governing classes at least\nwere powerfully restrained by family and ancestral feeling, and,\nif there were no temples or priests for public worship, there were\ninvariably shrines dedicated to the ancestors, with appropriate\nrites duly carried out by professional clerks or reciters.\nWhenever a ruler of any kind undertook any important expedition or\npossible duty, he was careful first to consult the oracles in\norder to ascertain the will of Heaven, and then to report the fact\nto the manes of his forefathers, who were likewise notified\nof any great victory, political change, or piece of good fortune.\nThere is a distinction (not easy to master) between the loss of a\nstate and the loss of a dynasty; in the latter case the population\nremain comparatively unaffected, and it is only the reigning\nfamily whose sacrifices to the gods of the place and of the\nharvest are interrupted. Thus in 567, when one of the very small\nvassals (of whom the ruler of Lu was mesne lord) crushed the\nother, it is explained that the spirits will not spiritually eat\nthe sacrifices (i.e. accept the worship) of one who does not\nbelong to the same family name, and that in this case the\nannihilating state was only a cousin through sisters: “when the\ncountry is ’lost,’ it means that the strange surname succeeds to\npower; but, when a strange surname becomes spiritual heir, we say\n’annihilated.’” We have seen in the ninth Chapter how the Shang\ndynasty lost the empire, but was sacrificially maintained in Sung.\nFrom the remotest times there seems to have been a tender\nunwillingness to “cut off all sacrifices” entirely, probably out\nof a feeling that retribution in like form might at some future\ndate occur to the ruthless condemner of others. There is another\nreason, which is, nearly all ruling families hailed from the same\nremote semi-mythical emperors, or from their ministers, or from\ntheir wives of inferior birth. Thus, although the body of the last\ntyrannical monarch of the Shang dynasty just cited was pierced\nthrough and through by the triumphant Chou monarch, that monarch’s\nbrother (acting as regent on behalf of the son and successor)\nconferred the principality of Sung upon the tyrant’s elder half-\nbrother by an inferior wife, “in order that the dynastic\nsacrifices might not be cut off\"; and to the very last the Duke of\nSung was the only ruling satrap under the Chou dynasty who\npermanently enjoyed the full title of “duke.” His neighbour, the\nMarquess of Wei (imperial clan), was, it is true, made “duke” in\n770 B.C. for services in connection with the Emperor’s flight; but\nthe title seems to have been tacitly abandoned, and at durbars he\nis always styled “marquess.” Of the Shang tyrant himself it is\nrecorded: “thus in 1122 B.C. he lost all in a single day, without\neven leaving posterity.” Of course his elder brother could not\npossibly be his spiritual heir. In 597 B.C., when Ts’u, in its\nstruggle with Tsin for the possession of CHENG, got the ruling\nEarl of CHENG in its power, the latter referred appealingly to his\nimperial ancestors (the first earl, in 806, was son of the Emperor\nwho fled from his capital north in 842), and said: “Let me\ncontinue their sacrifices.” There are, at least, a score of\nsimilar instances: the ancestral sacrifices seem to refer rather\nto posterity, whilst those to gods of the land and grain appear\nmore connected with rights as feoffee.",
        "Prayer is mentioned from the earliest times. For instance Shun,\nthe active ploughman monarch (not hereditary) who preceded the\nthree dynasties of Hia (2205-1767), Shang (1766-1123), and Chou\n(1122-249), prayed at a certain mountain in the centre of modern\nHu Nan province, where his grave still is, (a fact which points to\nthe possibility of the orthodox Chinese having worked their way\nnorthwards from the south-west). When the Chou conqueror,\nposthumously called the Martial King, fell ill, his brother, the\nDuke of Chou (later regent for the Martial King’s son), prayed to\nHeaven for his brother’s recovery, and offered himself as a\nsubstitute; the clerk was instructed to commit the offer to\nwriting, and this solemn document was securely locked up. The same\nman, when regent, again offered himself to Heaven for his sick\nnephew, cutting his nails off and throwing them into the river, as\na symbol of his willingness to give up his own body. The Emperor\nK’ang-hi of the present Manchu dynasty, perhaps in imitation of\nthe Duke of Chou, offered himself to Heaven in place of his sick\nMongol grandmother. A very curious instance of prayer occurs in\nconnection with the succession to the Tsin throne; it will be\nremembered that the legitimate heir committed dutiful suicide, and\ntwo other half-brothers (and, for a few months, one of these\nbrother’s sons) reigned before the second Protector secured his\nancestral rights. The suicide’s ghost appears to his usurping\nbrother, and says: “I have prayed to the Emperor (God), who will\nsoon deliver over Tsin into Ts’in’s hands, so that Ts’in will\nperform the sacrifices due to me.” The reply to the ghost was:\n“But the spirits will only eat the offerings if they come from the\nsame family stock.” The ghost said: “Very good; then I will pray\nagain. . . . God now says my half-brother will be overthrown at\nthe battle of Han” (the pass where the philosopher Lao-tsz is\nsupposed to have written his book 150 years later). In 645 the\nruler of Tsin was in fact captured in battle by his brother-in-law\nof Ts’in, who was indeed about to sacrifice to the Emperor on High\nas successor of Tsin; but he was dissuaded by his orthodox wife\n(the Tsin princess, daughter of a Ts’i princess as explained on\npage 51).",
        "In 575 Tsin is recorded as “invoking the spirits and requesting a\nvictory.” A little later one of the Tsin generals, after a defeat,\nissued a general order by way of concealing his weakness: to\ndeceive the enemy he suggested that the army should amongst other\nthings make a great show of praying for victory. There are many\nother similar analogous instances of undoubted prayer. Much later,\nin the year 210 B.C., when the King (as he had been) of Ts’in had\nconquered all China and given himself the name, for the first time\nin history, of August Emperor (the present title), he consulted\nhis soothsayers about an unpleasant dream he had had. He was\nadvised to pray, and to worship (or to sacrifice, for the two are\npractically one) with special ardour if he wished to bring things\nround to a favourable conclusion: and this is a monarch, too, who\nwas steeped in Lao-tsz’s philosophy.",
