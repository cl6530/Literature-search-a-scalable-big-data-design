        "The messengers leave we riding. / Now shall ye understand\nHow did the Lady Kriemhild / journey through the land,\nAnd where from her were parted / Gernot and Giselher.\nUpon her had they waited / as faithful unto her they were.",
        "1291",
        "As far as to the Danube / at Vergen did they ride,\nWhere must be the parting / from their royal sister’s side,\nFor that again they homeward / would ride unto the Rhine.\nNo eye but wet from weeping / in all the company was seen.",
        "1292",
        "Giselher the valiant / thus to his sister said:\n“If that thou ever, lady, / need hast of my aid,\nAnd fronts thee aught of trouble, / give me to understand,\nAnd straight I’ll ride to serve thee / afar unto King Etzel’s land.”",
        "1293",
        "Upon the mouth then kissed she / all her friends full dear.\nThe escort soon had taken / eke leave of Ruediger\nAnd the margrave’s warriors / in manner lovingly.\nWith the queen upon her journey / went many a maid full fair to see.",
        "1294",
        "Four beyond a hundred / there were, all richly clad\nIn silk of cunning pattern. / Many a shield full broad\nOn the way did guard the ladies / in hand of valiant thane.\nFull many a stately warrior / from thence did backward turn again.",
        "1295",
        "Thence away they hastened / down through Bavarian land.\nSoon were told the tidings / how that was at hand\nA mickle host of strangers, / where a cloister stands from yore\nAnd where the Inn its torrent / doth into Danube river pour.",
        "1296",
        "At Passau in the city / a lordly bishop bode.\nEmpty soon each lodging / and bishop’s palace stood:\nTo Bavarian land they hastened / the high guests to meet,\nAnd there the Bishop Pilgrim / the Lady Kriemhild fair did greet.",
        "1297",
        "The warriors of that country / no whit grieved they were\nThus to see follow with her / so many a maiden fair.\nUpon those high-born ladies / their eyes with joy did rest,\nFull comfortable quarters / prepared they for each noble guest.",
        "1298",
        "With his niece the bishop / unto Passau rode.\nWhen among the burghers / the story went abroad,\nThat thither was come Kriemhild, / the bishop’s niece full fair,\nSoon did the towns-people / reception meet for her prepare.",
        "1299",
        "There to have them tarry / was the bishop fain.\nTo him spake Sir Eckewart: / “Here may we not remain.\nUnto Ruediger’s country / must we journey down.\nThanes many there await us, / to whom our coming well is known.”",
        "1300",
        "The tidings now knew likewise / Lady Gotelinde fair.\nHerself and noble daughter / did them quick prepare.\nMessage she had from Ruediger / that he well pleased would be,\nShould she unto Lady / Kriemhild show such courtesy,",
        "1301",
        "That she ride forth to meet her, / and bring his warriors true\nUpward unto the Ense. / When they the tidings knew,\nSaw ye how on all sides / they thronged the busy way.\nForth to meet the strangers / rode and eke on foot went they.",
        "1302",
        "As far as Everdingen / meanwhile was come the queen:\nIn that Bavarian country / on the way were never seen\nRobbers seeking plunder, / as e’er their custom was:\nOf fear from such a quarter / had the travellers little cause.",
        "1303",
        "’Gainst that had well provided / the noble margrave:\nA band he led that numbered / good thousand warriors brave.\nThere was eke come Gotelinde, / spouse of Ruediger,\nAnd bearing her high company / full many noble knights there were.",
        "1304",
        "When came they o’er the Traune / by Ense on the green,\nThere full many an awning / outstretched and tent was seen,\nWherein that night the strangers / should find them welcome rest.\nWell was made provision / by Ruediger for each high guest.",
        "1305",
        "Not long fair Gotelinde did in her quarters stay,\nBut left them soon behind her. / Then coursed upon the way\nWith merry jingling bridle / many a well-shaped steed.\nFull fair was the reception: / whereat was Ruediger right glad.",
        "1306",
        "On one side and the other / did swell the stately train\nKnights that rode full gaily, / many a noble thane.\nAs they in joust disported, / full many a maid looked on,\nNor to the queen unwelcome / was the riders’ service done.",
        "1307",
        "As rode there ’fore the strangers / the men of Ruediger,\nFrom shaft full many a splinter / saw ye fly in air\nIn hand of doughty warrior / that jousted lustily.\nThem might ye ’fore the ladies / pricking in stately manner see.",
        "1308",
        "Anon therefrom they rested. / Knights many then did greet\nFull courteously each other. / Then forth Kriemhild to meet\nWent the fair Gotelinde, / by gallant warriors led.\nThose skilled in lady’s service, / –little there the rest they had.",
        "1309",
        "The lord of Bechelaren / unto his lady rode.\nSoon the noble margravine / her high rejoicing showed,\nThat all safe and sound he / from the Rhine was come again.\nThe care that filled her bosom / by mickle joy from her was ta’en.",
        "1310",
        "When him she had received, / her on the green he bade\nDismount with all the ladies / that in her train she led.\nThere saw ye all unidle / many a knight of high estate,\nWho with full ready service / upon the ladies then did wait.",
        "1311",
        "Then saw the Lady Kriemhild / the margravine where she stood\nAmid her fair attendants: / nearer not she rode.\nUpon the steed that bore her / the rein she drew full tight,\nAnd bade them straightway help her / adown from saddle to alight.",
        "1312",
        "The bishop saw ye leading / his sister’s daughter fair,\nAnd with him eke went Eckewart / to Gotelinde there.\nThe willing folk on all sides / made way before their feet.\nWith kiss did Gotelinde / the dame from land far distant greet.",
        "1313",
        "Then spake in manner kindly / the wife of Ruediger;\n“Right glad am I, dear lady, / that I thy visage fair\nHave in this our country / with mine own eyes seen.\nIn these times might never / greater joy to me have been.”",
        "1314",
        "“God give thee meed,” spake Kriemhild, / “Gotelinde, for this grace.\nIf with son of Botelung / happy may be my place,\nMay it henceforth be thy profit / that me thou here dost see.\"\nYet all unknown to either / was that which yet anon must be.",
        "1315",
        "With curtsy to each other / went full many a maid,\nThe knights a willing service / unto the ladies paid.\nAfter the greeting sat they / adown upon the green;\nKnew many then each other / that hitherto had strangers been.",
        "1316",
        "For the ladies they poured refreshment. / Now was come mid-day,\nAnd did those high attendants / there no longer stay,\nBut went where found they ready / many a spreading tent.\nFull willing was the service / unto the noble guests they lent.",
        "1317",
        "The night through until morning / did they rest them there.\nThey of Bechelaren / meanwhile did prepare\nThat into fitting quarters / each high guest be brought.\n’Twas by the care of Ruediger / that never one did want for aught.",
        "1318",
        "Open ye saw the windows / the castle walls along,\nAnd the burgh at Bechelaren / its gates wide open flung,\nAs through the guests went pricking, / that there full welcome were.\nFor them the lord full noble / had bidden quarters meet prepare.",
        "1319",
        "Ruediger’s fair daughter / with her attendant train\nCame forth in loving manner / to greet the lofty queen.\nWith her was eke her mother / the stately margravine;\nThere full friendly greeting / of many a maiden fair was seen.",
        "1320",
        "By the hand they took each other / and thence did pass each pair\nInto a Hall full spacious, / the which was builded fair,\nAnd ’neath its walls the Danube / flowed down with rushing tide.\nAs breezes cool played round them, / might they full happy there abide.",
        "1321",
        "What they there did further, / tell it not I can.\nThat they so long did tarry, / heard ye the knights complain\nThat were of Kriemhild’s company, / who unwilling there abode.\nWhat host of valiant warriors / with them from Bechelaren rode!",
        "1322",
        "Full kindly was the service / did render Ruediger,\nLikewise gave Lady Kriemhild / twelve golden armbands rare\nTo Gotelinde’s daughter, / and dress so richly wrought\nThat finer was none other / that into Etzel’s land she brought.",
        "1323",
        "Though Nibelungen treasure / from her erstwhile was ta’en,\nGood-will of all that knew her / did she e’er retain\nWith such little portion / as yet she did command.\nUnto her host’s attendants / dealt she thereof with bounteous hand.",
        "1324",
        "The Lady Gotelinde / such honors high again\nDid pay in gracious manner / to the guests afar from Rhine\nThat of all the strangers / found ye never one\nThat wore not rich attire / from her, and many a precious stone.",
        "1325",
        "When they their fast had broken / and would thence depart,\nThe lady of the castle / did pledge with faithful heart\nUnto the wife of Etzel / service true to bear.\nKriemhild caressed full fondly / the margravine’s young daughter fair.",
        "1326",
        "To the queen then spake the maiden: / “If e’er it pleaseth thee,\nWell know I that my father / dear full willingly\nUnto thee will send me / where thou livest in Hunland.\"\nThat faithful was the maiden, / full well did Kriemhild understand.",
        "1327",
        "Now ready were the horses / the castle steps before,\nAnd soon the queen full stately / did take her leave once more\nOf the lovely daughter / and spouse of Ruediger.\nEke parted with fair greeting / thence full many a maiden fair.",
        "1328",
        "Each other they full seldom / thereafter might behold.\nFrom Medelick were carried / beakers rich of gold\nIn hand and eke full many, / wherein was sparkling wine:\nUpon the way were greeted / thus the strangers from the Rhine.",
        "1329",
        "High there a lord was seated, / Astold the name he bore,\nWho that into Osterland / did lead the way before\nAs far as to Mautaren / adown the Danube’s side.\nThere did they fitting service / for the lofty queen provide.",
        "1330",
        "Of his niece the bishop / took leave in loving wise.\nThat she well should bear her, / did he oft advise,\nAnd that she win her honor / as Helke erst had done.\nAh, how great the honor / anon that ’mid the Huns she won!",
        "1331",
        "Unto the Traisem brought they / forth the strangers then.\nFair had they attendance / from Ruediger’s men,\nTill o’er the country riding / the Huns came them to meet.\nWith mickle honor did they / then the royal lady greet.",
        "1332",
        "For had the king of Hunland, / Traisem’s stream beside,\nA full mighty castle, / known afar and wide,\nThe same hight Traisenmauer: / Dame Helke there before\nDid sit, such bounteous mistress / as scarce ye ever might see more,",
        "1333",
        "An it were not Kriemhild / who could such bounty show,\nThat after days of sorrow / the pleasure she might know,\nTo be held in honor / by Etzel’s men each one:\nThat praise in fullest measure / had she amid those thanes anon.",
        "1334",
        "Afar the might of Etzel / so well was known around,\nThat at every season / within his court were found\nKnights of all the bravest, / whereof ye e’er did hear\nIn Christian lands or heathen: / with him all thither come they were.",
        "1335",
        "By him at every season, / as scarce might elsewhere be,\nKnights both of Christian doctrine / and heathen use saw ye.\nYet in what mind soever / did each and every stand,\nTo all in fullest measure / dealt the king with bounteous hand.",
