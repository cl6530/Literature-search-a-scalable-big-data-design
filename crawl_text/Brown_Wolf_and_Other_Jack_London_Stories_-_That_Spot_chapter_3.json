        "I don’t think much of Stephen Mackaye any more, though I used to swear\nby him. I know that in those days I loved him more than my own brother.\nIf ever I meet Stephen Mackaye again, I shall not be responsible for my\nactions. It passes beyond me that a man with whom I shared food and\nblanket, and with whom I mushed over the Chilcoot Trail, should turn out\nthe way he did. I always sized Steve up as a square man, a kindly\ncomrade, without an iota of anything vindictive or malicious in his\nnature. I shall never trust my judgment in men again. Why, I nursed that\nman through typhoid fever; we starved together on the headwaters of the\nStewart; and he saved my life on the Little Salmon. And now, after the\nyears we were together, all I can say of Stephen Mackaye is that he is\nthe meanest man I ever knew.",
        "We started for the Klondike in the fall rush of 1897, and we started too\nlate to get over Chilcoot Pass before the freeze-up. We packed our\noutfit on our backs part way over, when the snow began to fly, and then\nwe had to buy dogs in order to sled it the rest of the way. That was how\nwe came to get that Spot. Dogs were high, and we paid one hundred and\nten dollars for him. He looked worth it. I say looked, because he was\none of the finest appearing dogs I ever saw. He weighed sixty pounds,\nand he had all the lines of a good sled animal. We never could make out\nhis breed. He wasn’t husky, nor Malemute, nor Hudson Bay; he looked like\nall of them and he didn’t look like any of them; and on top of it all he\nhad some of the white man’s dog in him, for on one side, in the thick of\nthe mixed yellow-brown-red-and-dirty-white that was his prevailing\ncolor, there was a spot of coal-black as big as a water-bucket. That was\nwhy we called him Spot.",
        "He was a good looker all right. When he was in condition his muscles\nstood out in bunches all over him. And he was the strongest looking\nbrute I ever saw in Alaska, also the most intelligent looking. To run\nyour eyes over him, you’d think he could outpull three dogs of his own\nweight. Maybe he could, but I never saw it. His intelligence didn’t run\nthat way. He could steal and forage to perfection; he had an instinct\nthat was positively grewsome for divining when work was to be done and\nfor making a sneak accordingly; and for getting lost and not staying\nlost he was nothing short of inspired. But when it came to work, the way\nthat intelligence dribbled out of him and left him a mere clot of\nwobbling, stupid jelly would make your heart bleed.",
        "There are times when I think it wasn’t stupidity. Maybe, like some men I\nknow, he was too wise to work. I shouldn’t wonder if he put it all over\nus with that intelligence of his. Maybe he figured it all out and\ndecided that a licking now and again and no work was a whole lot better\nthan work all the time and no licking. He was intelligent enough for\nsuch a computation. I tell you, I’ve sat and looked into that dog’s eyes\ntill the shivers ran up and down my spine and the marrow crawled like\nyeast, what of the intelligence I saw shining out. I can’t express\nmyself about that intelligence. It is beyond mere words. I saw it,\nthat’s all. At times it was like gazing into a human soul, to look into\nhis eyes; and what I saw there frightened me and started all sorts of\nideas in my own mind of reincarnation and all the rest. I tell you I\nsensed something big in that brute’s eyes; there was a message there,\nbut I wasn’t big enough myself to catch it. Whatever it was (I know I’m\nmaking a fool of myself)–whatever it was, it baffled me. I can’t give\nan inkling of what I saw in that brute’s eyes; it wasn’t light, it\nwasn’t color; it was something that moved, away back, when the eyes\nthemselves weren’t moving. And I guess I didn’t see it move, either; I\nonly sensed that it moved. It was an expression,–that’s what it\nwas,–and I got an impression of it. No; it was different from a mere\nexpression; it was more than that. I don’t know what it was, but it gave\nme a feeling of kinship just the same. Oh, no, not sentimental kinship.\nIt was, rather, a kinship of equality. Those eyes never pleaded like a\ndeer’s eyes. They challenged. No, it wasn’t defiance. It was just a calm\nassumption of equality. And I don’t think it was deliberate. My belief\nis that it was unconscious on his part. It was there because it was\nthere, and it couldn’t help shining out. No, I don’t mean shine. It\ndidn’t shine; it moved. I know I’m talking rot, but if you’d looked\ninto that animal’s eyes the way I have, you’d understand. Steve was\naffected the same way I was. Why, I tried to kill that Spot once–he was\nno good for anything; and I fell down on it. I led him out into the\nbrush, and he came along slow and unwilling. He knew what was going on.\nI stopped in a likely place, put my foot on the rope, and pulled my big\nColt’s. And that dog sat down and looked at me. I tell you he didn’t\nplead. He just looked. And I saw all kinds of incomprehensible things\nmoving, yes, moving, in those eyes of his. I didn’t really see them\nmove; I thought I saw them, for, as I said before, I guess I only sensed\nthem. And I want to tell you right now that it got beyond me. It was\nlike killing a man, a conscious, brave man who looked calmly into your\ngun as much as to say, “Who’s afraid?” Then, too, the message seemed so\nnear that, instead of pulling the trigger quick, I stopped to see if I\ncould catch the message. There it was, right before me, glimmering all\naround in those eyes of his. And then it was too late. I got scared. I\nwas trembly all over, and my stomach generated a nervous palpitation\nthat made me seasick. I just sat down and looked at that dog, and he\nlooked at me, till I thought I was going crazy. Do you want to know what\nI did? I threw down the gun and ran back to camp with the fear of God in\nmy heart. Steve laughed at me. But I notice that Steve led Spot into the\nwoods, a week later, for the same purpose, and that Steve came back\nalone, and a little later Spot drifted back, too.",
        "At any rate, Spot wouldn’t work. We paid a hundred and ten dollars for\nhim from the bottom of our sack, and he wouldn’t work. He wouldn’t even\ntighten the traces. Steve spoke to him the first time we put him in\nharness, and he sort of shivered, that was all. Not an ounce on the\ntraces. He just stood still and wobbled, like so much jelly. Steve\ntouched him with the whip. He yelped, but not an ounce. Steve touched\nhim again, a bit harder, and he howled–the regular long wolf howl. Then\nSteve got mad and gave him half a dozen, and I came on the run from the\ntent. I told Steve he was brutal with the animal, and we had some\nwords–the first we’d ever had. He threw the whip down in the snow, and\nwalked away mad. I picked it up and went to it. That Spot trembled and\nwobbled and cowered before ever I swung the lash, and with the first\nbite of it he howled like a lost soul. Next he lay down in the snow. I\nstarted the rest of the dogs, and they dragged him along while I threw\nthe whip into him. He rolled over on his back and bumped along, his four\nlegs waving in the air, himself howling as though he was going through a\nsausage machine. Steve came back and laughed at me, and I apologized for\nwhat I’d said.",
        "There was no getting any work out of that Spot; and to make up for it,\nhe was the biggest pig-glutton of a dog I ever saw. On top of that, he\nwas the cleverest thief. There was no circumventing him. Many a\nbreakfast we went without our bacon because Spot had been there first.\nAnd it was because of him that we nearly starved to death up the\nStewart. He figured out the way to break into our meat-cache, and what\nhe didn’t eat, the rest of the team did. But he was impartial. He stole\nfrom every body. He was a restless dog always very busy snooping around\nor going somewhere. And there was never a camp within five miles that he\ndidn’t raid. The worst of it was that they always came back on us to pay\nhis board bill, which was just, being the law of the land; but it was\nmighty hard on us, especially that first winter on the Chilcoot, when we\nwere busted, paying for whole hams and sides of bacon that we never ate.\nHe could fight, too, that Spot. He could do anything but work. He never\npulled a pound, but he was the boss of the whole team. The way he made\nthose dogs stand around was an education. He bullied them, and there was\nalways one or more of them fresh-marked with his fangs. But he was more\nthan a bully. He wasn’t afraid of anything that walked on four legs; and\nI’ve seen him march, single-handed, into a strange team, without any\nprovocation whatever, and put the kibosh on the whole outfit. Did I\nsay he could eat? I caught him eating the whip once. That’s straight. He\nstarted in at the lash, and when I caught him he was down to the handle,\nand still going.",
        "But he was a good looker. At the end of the first week we sold him for\nseventy-five dollars to the Mounted Police. They had experienced\ndog-drivers, and we knew that by the time he’d covered the six hundred\nmiles to Dawson he’d be a good sled-dog. I say we knew, for we were\njust getting acquainted with that Spot. A little later we were not brash\nenough to know anything where he was concerned. A week later we woke up\nin the morning to the dangdest dog-fight we’d ever heard. It was that\nSpot came back and knocking the team into shape. We ate a pretty\ndepressing breakfast, I can tell you; but cheered up two hours afterward\nwhen we sold him to an official courier, bound in to Dawson with\ngovernment despatches. That Spot was only three days in coming back,\nand, as usual, celebrated his arrival with a rough-house.",
        "We spent the winter and spring, after our own outfit was across the\npass, freighting other people’s outfits; and we made a fat stake. Also,\nwe made money out of Spot. If we sold him once, we sold him twenty\ntimes. He always came back, and no one asked for their money. We didn’t\nwant the money. We’d have paid handsomely for any one to take him off\nour hands for keeps. We had to get rid of him, and we couldn’t give him\naway, for that would have been suspicious. But he was such a fine looker\nthat we never had any difficulty in selling him. “Unbroke,” we’d say,\nand they’d pay any old price for him. We sold him as low as twenty-five\ndollars, and once we got a hundred and fifty for him. That particular\nparty returned him in person, refused to take his money back, and the\nway he abused us was something awful. He said it was cheap at the price\nto tell us what he thought of us; and we felt he was so justified that\nwe never talked back. But to this day I’ve never quite regained all the\nold self-respect that was mine before that man talked to me.",
        "When the ice cleared out of the lakes and river, we put our outfit in a\nLake Bennett boat and started for Dawson. We had a good team of dogs,\nand of course we piled them on top the outfit. That Spot was\nalong–there was no losing him; and a dozen times, the first day, he\nknocked one or another of the dogs overboard in the course of fighting\nwith them. It was close quarters, and he didn’t like being crowded.",
        "“What that dog needs is space,” Steve said the second day. “Let’s\nmaroon him.”",
        "We did, running the boat in at Caribou Crossing for him to jump ashore.\nTwo of the other dogs, good dogs, followed him; and we lost two whole\ndays trying to find them. We never saw those two dogs again; but the\nquietness and relief we enjoyed made us decide, like the man who refused\nhis hundred and fifty, that it was cheap at the price. For the first\ntime in months Steve and I laughed and whistled and sang. We were as\nhappy as clams. The dark days were over. The nightmare had been lifted.\nThat Spot was gone.",
        "Three weeks later, one morning, Steve and I were standing on the\nriver-bank at Dawson. A small boat was just arriving from Lake Bennett.\nI saw Steve give a start, and heard him say something that was not nice\nand that was not under his breath. Then I looked; and there, in the bow\nof the boat, with ears pricked up, sat Spot. Steve and I sneaked\nimmediately, like beaten curs, like cowards, like absconders from\njustice. It was this last that the lieutenant of police thought when he\nsaw us sneaking. He surmised that there was law-officers in the boat\nwho were after us. He didn’t wait to find out, but kept us in sight,\nand in the M. & M. saloon got us in a corner. We had a merry time\nexplaining, for we refused to go back to the boat and meet Spot; and\nfinally he held us under guard of another policeman while he went to the\nboat. After we got clear of him, we started for the cabin, and when we\narrived, there was that Spot sitting on the stoop waiting for us. Now\nhow did he know we lived there? There were forty thousand people in\nDawson that summer, and how did he savve our cabin out of all the\ncabins? How did he know we were in Dawson, anyway? I leave it to you.\nBut don’t forget what I have said about his intelligence and that\nimmortal something I have seen glimmering in his eyes.",
        "There was no getting rid of him any more. There were too many people in\nDawson who had bought him up on Chilcoot, and the story got around. Half\na dozen times we put him on board steamboats going down the Yukon; but\nhe merely went ashore at the first landing and trotted back up the bank.\nWe couldn’t sell him, we couldn’t kill him (both Steve and I had tried),\nand nobody else was able to kill him. He bore a charmed life. I’ve seen\nhim go down in a dog-fight on the main street with fifty dogs on top of\nhim, and when they were separated, he’d appear on all his four legs,\nunharmed, while two of the dogs that had been on top of him would be\nlying dead.",
        "I saw him steal a chunk of moose meat from Major Dinwiddie’s cache so\nheavy that he could just keep one jump ahead of Mrs. Dinwiddie’s squaw\ncook, who was after him with an axe. As he went up the hill, after the\nsquaw gave up, Major Dinwiddie himself came out and pumped his\nWinchester into the landscape. He emptied his magazine twice, and never\ntouched that Spot. Then a policeman came along and arrested him for\ndischarging firearms inside the city limits. Major Dinwiddie paid his\nfine, and Steve and I paid him for the moose meat at the rate of a\ndollar a pound, bones and all. That was what he paid for it. Meat was\nhigh that year.",
        "I am only telling what I saw with my own eyes. And now I’ll tell you\nsomething also. I saw that Spot fall through a water-hole. The ice was\nthree and a half feet thick, and the current sucked him under like a\nstraw. Three hundred yards below was the big water-hole used by the\nhospital. Spot crawled out of the hospital water-hole, licked off the\nwater, bit out the ice that had formed between his toes, trotted up the\nbank, and whipped a big Newfoundland belonging to the Gold Commissioner.",
        "In the fall of 1898, Steve and I poled up the Yukon on the last water,\nbound for Stewart River. We took the dogs along, all except Spot. We\nfigured we’d been feeding him long enough. He’d cost us more time and\ntrouble and money and grub than we’d got by selling him on the\nChilcoot–especially grub. So Steve and I tied him down in the cabin and\npulled our freight. We camped that night at the mouth of Indian River,\nand Steve and I were pretty facetious over having shaken him. Steve was\na funny fellow, and I was just sitting up in the blankets and laughing\nwhen a tornado hit camp. The way that Spot walked into those dogs and\ngave them what-for was hair-raising. Now how did he get loose? It’s up\nto you. I haven’t any theory. And how did he get across the Klondike\nRiver? That’s another facer. And anyway, how did he know we had gone up\nthe Yukon? You see, we went by water, and he couldn’t smell our tracks.\nSteve and I began to get superstitious about that dog. He got on our\nnerves, too; and, between you and me, we were just a mite afraid of him.",
        "The freeze-up came on when we were at the mouth of Henderson Creek, and\nwe traded him off for two sacks of flour to an outfit that was bound up\nWhite River after copper. Now that whole outfit was lost. Never trace\nnor hide nor hair of men, dogs, sleds, or anything was ever found. They\ndropped clean out of sight. It became one of the mysteries of the\ncountry. Steve and I plugged away up the Stewart, and six weeks\nafterward that Spot crawled into camp. He was a perambulating skeleton,\nand could just drag along; but he got there. And what I want to know is\nwho told him we were up the Stewart? We could have gone a thousand other\nplaces. How did he know? You tell me, and I’ll tell you.",
        "No losing him. At the Mayo he started a row with an Indian dog. The buck\nwho owned the dog took a swing at Spot with an axe, missed him, and\nkilled his own dog. Talk about magic and turning bullets aside–I, for\none, consider it a blamed sight harder to turn an axe aside with a big\nbuck at the other end of it. And I saw him do it with my own eyes. That\nbuck didn’t want to kill his own dog. You’ve got to show me.",
        "I told you about Spot breaking into our meat-cache. It was nearly the\ndeath of us. There wasn’t any more meat to be killed and meat was all we\nhad to live on. The moose had gone back several hundred miles and the\nIndians with them. There we were. Spring was on and we had to wait for\nthe river to break. We got pretty thin before we decided to eat the\ndogs, and we decided to eat Spot first. Do you know what that dog did?\nHe sneaked. Now how did he know our minds were made up to eat him? We\nsat up nights laying for him, but he never came back, and we ate the\nother dogs. We ate the whole team.",
        "And now for the sequel. You know what it is when a big river breaks up\nand a few billion tons of ice go out, jamming and milling and grinding.\nJust in the thick of it, when the Stewart went out, rumbling and\nroaring, we sighted Spot out in the middle. He’d got caught as he was\ntrying to cross up above somewhere. Steve and I yelled and shouted and\nran up and down the bank, tossing our hats in the air. Sometimes we’d\nstop and hug each other, we were that boisterous, for we saw Spot’s\nfinish. He didn’t have a chance in a million. He didn’t have any chance\nat all. After the ice-run, we got into a canoe and paddled down to the\nYukon, and down the Yukon to Dawson, stopping to feed up for a week at\nthe cabins at the mouth of Henderson Creek. And as we came in to the\nbank at Dawson, there sat that Spot, waiting for us, his ears pricked\nup, his tail wagging, his mouth smiling, extending a hearty welcome to\nus. Now how did he get out of that ice? How did he know we were coming\nto Dawson, to the very hour and minute, to be out there on the bank\nwaiting for us?",
        "The more I think of that Spot, the more I am convinced that there are\nthings in this world that go beyond science. On no scientific grounds\ncan that Spot be explained. It’s psychic phenomena, or mysticism, or\nsomething of that sort, I guess, with a lot of Theosophy thrown in. The\nKlondike is a good country. I might have been there yet, and become a\nmillionaire, if it hadn’t been for Spot. He got on my nerves. I stood\nhim for two years all together, and then I guess my stamina broke. It\nwas the summer of 1899 when I pulled out. I didn’t say anything to\nSteve. I just sneaked. But I fixed it up all right. I wrote Steve a\nnote, and enclosed a package of “rough-on-rats,” telling him what to do\nwith it. I was worn down to skin and bone by that Spot, and I was that\nnervous that I’d jump and look around when there wasn’t anybody within\nhailing distance. But it was astonishing the way I recuperated when I\ngot quit of him. I got back twenty pounds before I arrived in San\nFrancisco, and by the time I’d crossed the ferry to Oakland I was my old\nself again, so that even my wife looked in vain for any change in me.",
        "Steve wrote to me once, and his letter seemed irritated. He took it kind\nof hard because I’d left him with Spot. Also, he said he’d used the\n“rough-on-rats,” per directions, and that there was nothing doing. A\nyear went by. I was back in the office and prospering in all ways–even\ngetting a bit fat. And then Steve arrived. He didn’t look me up. I read\nhis name in the steamer list, and wondered why. But I didn’t wonder\nlong. I got up one morning and found that Spot chained to the gatepost\nand holding up the milkman. Steve went north to Seattle, I learned, that\nvery morning. I didn’t put on any more weight. My wife made me buy him a\ncollar and tag, and within an hour he showed his gratitude by killing\nher pet Persian cat. There is no getting rid of that Spot. He will be\nwith me until I die, for he’ll never die. My appetite is not so good\nsince he arrived, and my wife says I am looking peaked. Last night that\nSpot got into Mr. Harvey’s hen-house (Harvey is my next door neighbor)\nand killed nineteen of his fancy-bred chickens. I shall have to pay for\nthem. My neighbors on the other side quarreled with my wife and then\nmoved out. Spot was the cause of it. And that is why I am disappointed\nin Stephen Mackaye. I had no idea he was so mean a man.",
