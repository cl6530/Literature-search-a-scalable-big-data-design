        "  After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all\nwas dead silence, and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm.\nThere was no one to be seen, and her first thought was that she\nmust have been dreaming about the Lion and the Unicorn and those\nqueer Anglo-Saxon Messengers.  However, there was the great dish\nstill lying at her feet, on which she had tried to cut the plum-\ncake, ’So I wasn’t dreaming, after all,’ she said to herself,\n’unless–unless we’re all part of the same dream.  Only I do\nhope it’s MY dream, and not the Red King’s!  I don’t like\nbelonging to another person’s dream,’ she went on in a rather\ncomplaining tone:  ’I’ve a great mind to go and wake him, and see\nwhat happens!’",
        "  At this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting\nof ’Ahoy!  Ahoy!  Check!’ and a Knight dressed in crimson armour\ncame galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club.  Just as\nhe reached her, the horse stopped suddenly:  ’You’re my\nprisoner!’ the Knight cried, as he tumbled off his horse.",
        "  Startled as she was, Alice was more frightened for him than for\nherself at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he\nmounted again.  As soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he\nbegan once more ’You’re my–’ but here another voice broke in\n’Ahoy!  Ahoy!  Check!’ and Alice looked round in some surprise\nfor the new enemy.",
        "  This time it was a White Knight.  He drew up at Alice’s side,\nand tumbled off his horse just as the Red Knight had done:  then\nhe got on again, and the two Knights sat and looked at each other\nfor some time without speaking.  Alice looked from one to the\nother in some bewilderment.",
        "  ’She’s MY prisoner, you know!’ the Red Knight said at last.",
        "  ’Yes, but then I came and rescued her!’ the White Knight\nreplied.",
        "  ’Well, we must fight for her, then,’ said the Red Knight, as he\ntook up his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something\nthe shape of a horse’s head), and put it on.",
        "  ’You will observe the Rules of Battle, of course?’ the White\nKnight remarked, putting on his helmet too.",
        "  ’I always do,’ said the Red Knight, and they began banging away\nat each other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be\nout of the way of the blows.",
        "  ’I wonder, now, what the Rules of Battle are,’ she said to\nherself, as she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her\nhiding-place:  ’one Rule seems to be, that if one Knight hits the\nother, he knocks him off his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles\noff himself–and another Rule seems to be that they hold their\nclubs with their arms, as if they were Punch and Judy–What a\nnoise they make when they tumble!  Just like a whole set of fire-\nirons falling into the fender!  And how quiet the horses are!\nThey let them get on and off them just as if they were tables!’",
        "  Another Rule of Battle, that Alice had not noticed, seemed to\nbe that they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended\nwith their both falling off in this way, side by side:  when they\ngot up again, they shook hands, and then the Red Knight mounted\nand galloped off.",
        "  ’It was a glorious victory, wasn’t it?’ said the White Knight,\nas he came up panting.",
        "  ’I don’t know,’ Alice said doubtfully.  ’I don’t want to be\nanybody’s prisoner.  I want to be a Queen.’",
        "  ’So you will, when you’ve crossed the next brook,’ said the\nWhite Knight.  ’I’ll see you safe to the end of the wood–and\nthen I must go back, you know.  That’s the end of my move.’",
        "  ’Thank you very much,’ said Alice.  ’May I help you off with\nyour helmet?’  It was evidently more than he could manage by\nhimself; however, she managed to shake him out of it at last.",
        "  ’Now one can breathe more easily,’ said the Knight, putting\nback his shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face\nand large mild eyes to Alice.  She thought she had never seen\nsuch a strange-looking soldier in all her life.",
        "  He was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very\nbadly, and he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across\nhis shoulder, upside-down, and with the lid hanging open.  Alice\nlooked at it with great curiosity.",
        "  ’I see you’re admiring my little box.’ the Knight said in a\nfriendly tone.  ’It’s my own invention–to keep clothes and\nsandwiches in.  You see I carry it upside-down, so that the rain\ncan’t get in.’",
        "  ’But the things can get OUT,’ Alice gently remarked.  ’Do you\nknow the lid’s open?’",
        "  ’I didn’t know it,’ the Knight said, a shade of vexation\npassing over his face.  ’Then all the things must have fallen\nout!  And the box is no use without them.’  He unfastened it as\nhe spoke, and was just going to throw it into the bushes,\nwhen a sudden thought seemed to strike him, and he hung it carefully\non a tree.  ’Can you guess why I did that?’ he said to Alice.",
        "  Alice shook her head.",
        "  ’In hopes some bees may make a nest in it–then I should get the honey.’",
        "  ’But you’ve got a bee-hive–or something like one–fastened to\nthe saddle,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’Yes, it’s a very good bee-hive,’ the Knight said in a\ndiscontented tone, ’one of the best kind.  But not a single bee\nhas come near it yet.  And the other thing is a mouse-trap.  I\nsuppose the mice keep the bees out–or the bees keep the mice\nout, I don’t know which.’",
        "  ’I was wondering what the mouse-trap was for,’ said Alice.  ’It\nisn’t very likely there would be any mice on the horse’s back.’",
        "  ’Not very likely, perhaps,’ said the Knight:  ’but if they DO\ncome, I don’t choose to have them running all about.’",
        "  ’You see,’ he went on after a pause, ’it’s as well to be\nprovided for EVERYTHING.  That’s the reason the horse has all\nthose anklets round his feet.’",
        "  ’But what are they for?’ Alice asked in a tone of great\ncuriosity.",
        "  ’To guard against the bites of sharks,’ the Knight replied.\n’It’s an invention of my own.  And now help me on.  I’ll go with\nyou to the end of the wood–What’s the dish for?’",
        "  ’It’s meant for plum-cake,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’We’d better take it with us,’ the Knight said.  ’It’ll come in\nhandy if we find any plum-cake.  Help me to get it into this bag.’",
        "  This took a very long time to manage, though Alice held the\nbag open very carefully, because the Knight was so VERY awkward\nin putting in the dish:  the first two or three times that he\ntried he fell in himself instead.  ’It’s rather a tight fit, you\nsee,’ he said, as they got it in a last; ’There are so many\ncandlesticks in the bag.’  And he hung it to the saddle, which\nwas already loaded with bunches of carrots, and fire-irons, and\nmany other things.",
        "  ’I hope you’ve got your hair well fastened on?’ he continued,\nas they set off.",
        "  ’Only in the usual way,’ Alice said, smiling.",
        "  ’That’s hardly enough,’ he said, anxiously.  ’You see the wind\nis so VERY strong here.  It’s as strong as soup.’",
        "  ’Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown\noff?’ Alice enquired.",
        "  ’Not yet,’ said the Knight.  ’But I’ve got a plan for keeping\nit from FALLING off.’",
        "  ’I should like to hear it, very much.’",
        "  ’First you take an upright stick,’ said the Knight.  ’Then you\nmake your hair creep up it, like a fruit-tree.  Now the reason\nhair falls off is because it hangs DOWN–things never fall\nUPWARDS, you know.  It’s a plan of my own invention.  You may try\nit if you like.’",
        "  It didn’t sound a comfortable plan, Alice thought, and for a\nfew minutes she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and\nevery now and then stopping to help the poor Knight, who\ncertainly was NOT a good rider.",
        "  Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell\noff in front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally\ndid rather suddenly), he fell off behind.  Otherwise he kept on\npretty well, except that he had a habit of now and then falling\noff sideways; and as he generally did this on the side on which\nAlice was walking, she soon found that it was the best plan not\nto walk QUITE close to the horse.",
        "  ’I’m afraid you’ve not had much practice in riding,’ she\nventured to say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble.",
        "  The Knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at\nthe remark.  ’What makes you say that?’ he asked, as he scrambled\nback into the saddle, keeping hold of Alice’s hair with one hand,\nto save himself from falling over on the other side.",
        "  ’Because people don’t fall off quite so often, when they’ve had\nmuch practice.’",
        "  ’I’ve had plenty of practice,’ the Knight said very gravely:\n’plenty of practice!’",
        "  Alice could think of nothing better to say than ’Indeed?’ but\nshe said it as heartily as she could.  They went on a little way\nin silence after this, the Knight with his eyes shut, muttering\nto himself, and Alice watching anxiously for the next tumble.",
        "  ’The great art of riding,’ the Knight suddenly began in a loud\nvoice, waving his right arm as he spoke, ’is to keep–’ Here\nthe sentence ended as suddenly as it had begun, as the Knight\nfell heavily on the top of his head exactly in the path where\nAlice was walking.  She was quite frightened this time, and said\nin an anxious tone, as she picked him up, ’I hope no bones are broken?’",
        "  ’None to speak of,’ the Knight said, as if he didn’t mind breaking\ntwo or three of them.  ’The great art of riding, as I was saying,\nis–to keep your balance properly.  Like this, you know–’",
        "  He let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show\nAlice what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back,\nright under the horse’s feet.",
        "  ’Plenty of practice!’ he went on repeating, all the time that\nAlice was getting him on his feet again.  ’Plenty of practice!’",
        "  ’It’s too ridiculous!’ cried Alice, losing all her patience this time.\n’You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought!’",
        "  ’Does that kind go smoothly?’ the Knight asked in a tone of\ngreat interest, clasping his arms round the horse’s neck as he\nspoke, just in time to save himself from tumbling off again.",
        "  ’Much more smoothly than a live horse,’ Alice said, with a little\nscream of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it.",
        "  ’I’ll get one,’ the Knight said thoughtfully to himself.  ’One\nor two–several.’",
        "  There was a short silence after this, and then the Knight went\non again.  ’I’m a great hand at inventing things.  Now, I daresay\nyou noticed, that last time you picked me up, that I was looking\nrather thoughtful?’",
        "  ’You WERE a little grave,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a\ngate–would you like to hear it?’",
        "  ’Very much indeed,’ Alice said politely.",
        "  ’I’ll tell you how I came to think of it,’ said the Knight.\n’You see, I said to myself, “The only difficulty is with the\nfeet:  the HEAD is high enough already.”  Now, first I put my\nhead on the top of the gate–then I stand on my head–then\nthe feet are high enough, you see–then I’m over, you see.’",
        "  ’Yes, I suppose you’d be over when that was done,’ Alice said\nthoughtfully:  ’but don’t you think it would be rather hard?’",
        "  ’I haven’t tried it yet,’ the Knight said, gravely:  ’so I can’t tell\nfor certain–but I’m afraid it WOULD be a little hard.’",
        "  He looked so vexed at the idea, that Alice changed the subject\nhastily.  ’What a curious helmet you’ve got!’ she said cheerfully.\n’Is that your invention too?’",
        "  The Knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from\nthe saddle.  ’Yes,’ he said, ’but I’ve invented a better one than\nthat–like a sugar loaf.  When I used to wear it, if I fell off\nthe horse, it always touched the ground directly.  So I had a\nVERY little way to fall, you see–But there WAS the danger of\nfalling INTO it, to be sure.  That happened to me once–and the\nworst of it was, before I could get out again, the other White\nKnight came and put it on.  He thought it was his own helmet.’",
        "  The knight looked so solemn about it that Alice did not dare to\nlaugh.  ’I’m afraid you must have hurt him,’ she said in a\ntrembling voice, ’being on the top of his head.’",
        "  ’I had to kick him, of course,’ the Knight said, very seriously.\n’And then he took the helmet off again–but it took hours and hours\nto get me out.  I was as fast as–as lightning, you know.’",
        "  ’But that’s a different kind of fastness,’ Alice objected.",
        "  The Knight shook his head.  ’It was all kinds of fastness with\nme, I can assure you!’ he said.  He raised his hands in some\nexcitement as he said this, and instantly rolled out of the\nsaddle, and fell headlong into a deep ditch.",
        "  Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him.  She was\nrather startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very\nwell, and she was afraid that he really WAS hurt this time.\nHowever, though she could see nothing but the soles of his feet,\nshe was much relieved to hear that he was talking on in his usual\ntone.  ’All kinds of fastness,’ he repeated:  ’but it was\ncareless of him to put another man’s helmet on–with the man in\nit, too.’",
        "  ’How CAN you go on talking so quietly, head downwards?’ Alice\nasked, as she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap\non the bank.",
        "  The Knight looked surprised at the question.  ’What does it\nmatter where my body happens to be?’ he said.  ’My mind goes on\nworking all the same.  In fact, the more head downwards I am, the\nmore I keep inventing new things.’",
        "  ’Now the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did,’ he went\non after a pause, ’was inventing a new pudding during the meat-\ncourse.’",
        "  ’In time to have it cooked for the next course?’ said Alice.\n’Well, not the NEXT course,’ the Knight said in a slow thoughtful\ntone:  ’no, certainly not the next COURSE.’",
        "  ’Then it would have to be the next day.  I suppose you wouldn’t\nhave two pudding-courses in one dinner?’",
        "  ’Well, not the NEXT day,’ the Knight repeated as before:  ’not\nthe next DAY.  In fact,’ he went on, holding his head down, and\nhis voice getting lower and lower, ’I don’t believe that pudding\never WAS cooked!  In fact, I don’t believe that pudding ever WILL\nbe cooked!  And yet it was a very clever pudding to invent.’",
        "  ’What did you mean it to be made of?’ Alice asked, hoping to\ncheer him up, for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it.",
        "  ’It began with blotting paper,’ the Knight answered with a groan.",
        "  ’That wouldn’t be very nice, I’m afraid–’",
        "  ’Not very nice ALONE,’ he interrupted, quite eagerly:  ’but\nyou’ve no idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other\nthings–such as gunpowder and sealing-wax.  And here I must\nleave you.’  They had just come to the end of the wood.",
        "  Alice could only look puzzled:  she was thinking of the pudding.",
        "  ’You are sad,’ the Knight said in an anxious tone:  ’let me sing\nyou a song to comfort you.’",
        "  ’Is it very long?’ Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal\nof poetry that day.",
        "  ’It’s  long,’ said the Knight, ’but very, VERY beautiful.\nEverybody that hears me sing it–either it brings the TEARS\ninto their eyes, or else–’",
        "  ’Or else what?’ said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden\npause.",
        "  ’Or else it doesn’t, you know.  The name of the song is called\n“HADDOCKS’ EYES.\"’",
        "  ’Oh, that’s the name of the song, is it?’ Alice said, trying to\nfeel interested.",
        "  ’No, you don’t understand,’ the Knight said, looking a little\nvexed.  ’That’s what the name is CALLED.  The name really IS “THE\nAGED AGED MAN.\"’",
        "  ’Then I ought to have said “That’s what the SONG is called”?’\nAlice corrected herself.",
        "  ’No, you oughtn’t:  that’s quite another thing!  The SONG is\ncalled “WAYS AND MEANS”:  but that’s only what it’s CALLED, you\nknow!’",
        "  ’Well, what IS the song, then?’ said Alice, who was by this\ntime completely bewildered.",
        "  ’I was coming to that,’ the Knight said.  ’The song really IS\n“A-SITTING ON A GATE”:  and the tune’s my own invention.’",
        "  So saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its\nneck:  then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint\nsmile lighting up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the\nmusic of his song, he began.",
        "  Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through\nThe Looking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered\nmost clearly.  Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene\nback again, as if it had been only yesterday–the mild blue\neyes and kindly smile of the Knight–the setting sun gleaming\nthrough his hair, and shining on his armour in a blaze of light\nthat quite dazzled her–the horse quietly moving about, with\nthe reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the grass at her\nfeet–and the black shadows of the forest behind–all this\nshe took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes,\nshe leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and\nlistening, in a half dream, to the melancholy music of the song.",
        "  ’But the tune ISN’T his own invention,’ she said to herself:\n’it’s “I GIVE THEE ALL, I CAN NO MORE.\"’  She stood and listened\nvery attentively, but no tears came into her eyes.",
        "            ’I’ll tell thee everything I can;\n              There’s little to relate.\n            I saw an aged aged man,\n              A-sitting on a gate.\n            “Who are you, aged man?” I said,\n              “and how is it you live?\"\n            And his answer trickled through my head\n              Like water through a sieve.",
        "            He said “I look for butterflies\n              That sleep among the wheat:\n            I make them into mutton-pies,\n              And sell them in the street.\n            I sell them unto men,” he said,\n              “Who sail on stormy seas;\n            And that’s the way I get my bread–\n              A trifle, if you please.”",
        "            But I was thinking of a plan\n              To dye one’s whiskers green,\n            And always use so large a fan\n              That they could not be seen.\n            So, having no reply to give\n              To what the old man said,\n            I cried, “Come, tell me how you live!\"\n              And thumped him on the head.",
        "            His accents mild took up the tale:\n              He said “I go my ways,\n            And when I find a mountain-rill,\n              I set it in a blaze;\n            And thence they make a stuff they call\n              Rolands’ Macassar Oil–\n            Yet twopence-halfpenny is all\n              They give me for my toil.”",
        "            But I was thinking of a way\n              To feed oneself on batter,\n            And so go on from day to day\n              Getting a little fatter.\n            I shook him well from side to side,\n              Until his face was blue:\n            “Come, tell me how you live,” I cried,\n              “And what it is you do!”",
        "            He said “I hunt for haddocks’ eyes\n              Among the heather bright,\n            And work them into waistcoat-buttons\n              In the silent night.\n            And these I do not sell for gold\n              Or coin of silvery shine\n            But for a copper halfpenny,\n              And that will purchase nine.",
        "            “I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,\n              Or set limed twigs for crabs;\n            I sometimes search the grassy knolls\n              For wheels of Hansom-cabs.\n            And that’s the way” (he gave a wink)\n              “By which I get my wealth–\n            And very gladly will I drink\n              Your Honour’s noble health.”",
        "            I heard him then, for I had just\n              Completed my design\n            To keep the Menai bridge from rust\n              By boiling it in wine.\n            I thanked him much for telling me\n              The way he got his wealth,\n            But chiefly for his wish that he\n              Might drink my noble health.",
        "            And now, if e’er by chance I put\n              My fingers into glue\n            Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot\n              Into a left-hand shoe,\n            Or if I drop upon my toe\n              A very heavy weight,\n            I weep, for it reminds me so,\n              Of that old man I used to know–",
        "            Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,\n            Whose hair was whiter than the snow,\n            Whose face was very like a crow,\n            With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,\n            Who seemed distracted with his woe,\n            Who rocked his body to and fro,\n            And muttered mumblingly and low,\n            As if his mouth were full of dough,\n            Who snorted like a buffalo–\n            That summer evening, long ago,\n              A-sitting on a gate.’",
        "  As the Knight sang the last words of the ballad, he gathered up\nthe reins, and turned his horse’s head  along the road by which\nthey had come.  ’You’ve only a few yards to go,’ he said,’ down\nthe hill and over that little brook, and then you’ll be a Queen–\nBut you’ll stay and see me off first?’ he added as Alice turned\nwith an eager look in the direction to which he pointed.  ’I\nshan’t be long.  You’ll wait and wave your handkerchief when I\nget to that turn in the road?  I think it’ll encourage me, you\nsee.’",
        "  ’Of course I’ll wait,’ said Alice:  ’and thank you very much\nfor coming so far–and for the song–I liked it very much.’",
        "  ’I hope so,’ the Knight said doubtfully:  ’but you didn’t cry\nso much as I thought you would.’",
        "  So they shook hands, and then the Knight rode slowly away into\nthe forest.  ’It won’t take long to see him OFF, I expect,’\nAlice said to herself, as she stood watching him.  ’There he\ngoes!  Right on his head as usual!  However, he gets on again\npretty easily–that comes of having so many things hung round\nthe horse–’  So she went on talking to herself, as she watched\nthe horse walking leisurely along the road, and the Knight\ntumbling off, first on one side and then on the other.  After the\nfourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved\nher handkerchief to him, and waited till he was out of sight.",
        "  ’I hope it encouraged him,’ she said, as she turned to run\ndown the hill:  ’and now for the last brook, and to be a Queen!\nHow grand it sounds!’  A very few steps brought her to the edge of\nthe brook.  ’The Eighth Square at last!’ she cried as she bounded across,",
