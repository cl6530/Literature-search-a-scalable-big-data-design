        "One of those sights in which most horror is to be encountered is,\nsurely, the general aspect of the Parisian populace–a people fearful\nto behold, gaunt, yellow, tawny. Is not Paris a vast field in\nperpetual turmoil from a storm of interests beneath which are whirled\nalong a crop of human beings, who are, more often than not, reaped by\ndeath, only to be born again as pinched as ever, men whose twisted and\ncontorted faces give out at every pore the instinct, the desire, the\npoisons with which their brains are pregnant; not faces so much as\nmasks; masks of weakness, masks of strength, masks of misery, masks of\njoy, masks of hypocrisy; all alike worn and stamped with the indelible\nsigns of a panting cupidity? What is it they want? Gold or pleasure? A\nfew observations upon the soul of Paris may explain the causes of its\ncadaverous physiognomy, which has but two ages–youth and decay:\nyouth, wan and colorless; decay, painted to seem young. In looking at\nthis excavated people, foreigners, who are not prone to reflection,\nexperience at first a movement of disgust towards the capital, that\nvast workshop of delights, from which, in a short time, they cannot\neven extricate themselves, and where they stay willingly to be\ncorrupted. A few words will suffice to justify physiologically the\nalmost infernal hue of Parisian faces, for it is not in mere sport\nthat Paris has been called a hell. Take the phrase for truth. There\nall is smoke and fire, everything gleams, crackles, flames,\nevaporates, dies out, then lights up again, with shooting sparks, and\nis consumed. In no other country has life ever been more ardent or\nacute. The social nature, even in fusion, seems to say after each\ncompleted work: “Pass on to another!” just as Nature says herself.\nLike Nature herself, this social nature is busied with insects and\nflowers of a day–ephemeral trifles; and so, too, it throws up fire\nand flame from its eternal crater. Perhaps, before analyzing the\ncauses which lend a special physiognomy to each tribe of this\nintelligent and mobile nation, the general cause should be pointed out\nwhich bleaches and discolors, tints with blue or brown individuals in\nmore or less degree.",
        "By dint of taking interest in everything, the Parisian ends by being\ninterested in nothing. No emotion dominating his face, which friction\nhas rubbed away, it turns gray like the faces of those houses upon\nwhich all kinds of dust and smoke have blown. In effect, the Parisian,\nwith his indifference on the day for what the morrow will bring forth,\nlives like a child, whatever may be his age. He grumbles at\neverything, consoles himself for everything, jests at everything,\nforgets, desires, and tastes everything, seizes all with passion,\nquits all with indifference–his kings, his conquests, his glory, his\nidols of bronze or glass–as he throws away his stockings, his hats,\nand his fortune. In Paris no sentiment can withstand the drift of\nthings, and their current compels a struggle in which the passions are\nrelaxed: there love is a desire, and hatred a whim; there’s no true\nkinsman but the thousand-franc note, no better friend than the\npawnbroker. This universal toleration bears its fruits, and in the\nsalon, as in the street, there is no one de trop, there is no one\nabsolutely useful, or absolutely harmful–knaves or fools, men of wit\nor integrity. There everything is tolerated: the government and the\nguillotine, religion and the cholera. You are always acceptable to\nthis world, you will never be missed by it. What, then, is the\ndominating impulse in this country without morals, without faith,\nwithout any sentiment, wherein, however, every sentiment, belief, and\nmoral has its origin and end? It is gold and pleasure. Take those two\nwords for a lantern, and explore that great stucco cage, that hive\nwith its black gutters, and follow the windings of that thought which\nagitates, sustains, and occupies it! Consider! And, in the first\nplace, examine the world which possesses nothing.",
        "The artisan, the man of the proletariat, who uses his hands, his\ntongue, his back, his right arm, his five fingers, to live–well, this\nvery man, who should be the first to economize his vital principle,\noutruns his strength, yokes his wife to some machine, wears out his\nchild, and ties him to the wheel. The manufacturer–or I know not what\nsecondary thread which sets in motion all these folk who with their\nfoul hands mould and gild porcelain, sew coats and dresses, beat out\niron, turn wood and steel, weave hemp, festoon crystal, imitate\nflowers, work woolen things, break in horses, dress harness, carve in\ncopper, paint carriages, blow glass, corrode the diamond, polish\nmetals, turn marble into leaves, labor on pebbles, deck out thought,\ntinge, bleach, or blacken everything–well, this middleman has come to\nthat world of sweat and good-will, of study and patience, with\npromises of lavish wages, either in the name of the town’s caprices or\nwith the voice of the monster dubbed speculation. Thus, these\nquadrumanes set themselves to watch, work, and suffer, to fast,\nsweat, and bestir them. Then, careless of the future, greedy of\npleasure, counting on their right arm as the painter on his palette,\nlords for one day, they throw their money on Mondays to the cabaretswhich gird the town like a belt of mud, haunts of the most shameless\nof the daughters of Venus, in which the periodical money of this\npeople, as ferocious in their pleasures as they are calm at work, is\nsquandered as it had been at play. For five days, then, there is no\nrepose for this laborious portion of Paris! It is given up to actions\nwhich make it warped and rough, lean and pale, gush forth with a\nthousand fits of creative energy. And then its pleasure, its repose,\nare an exhausting debauch, swarthy and black with blows, white with\nintoxication, or yellow with indigestion. It lasts but two days, but\nit steals to-morrow’s bread, the week’s soup, the wife’s dress, the\nchild’s wretched rags. Men, born doubtless to be beautiful–for all\ncreatures have a relative beauty–are enrolled from their childhood\nbeneath the yoke of force, beneath the rule of the hammer, the chisel,\nthe loom, and have been promptly vulcanized. Is not Vulcan, with his\nhideousness and his strength, the emblem of this strong and hideous\nnation–sublime in its mechanical intelligence, patient in its season,\nand once in a century terrible, inflammable as gunpowder, and ripe\nwith brandy for the madness of revolution, with wits enough, in fine,\nto take fire at a captious word, which signifies to it always: Gold\nand Pleasure! If we comprise in it all those who hold out their hands\nfor an alms, for lawful wages, or the five francs that are granted to\nevery kind of Parisian prostitution, in short, for all the money well\nor ill earned, this people numbers three hundred thousand individuals.\nWere it not for the cabarets, would not the Government be overturned\nevery Tuesday? Happily, by Tuesday, this people is glutted, sleeps off\nits pleasure, is penniless, and returns to its labor, to dry bread,\nstimulated by a need of material procreation, which has become a habit\nto it. None the less, this people has its phenomenal virtues, its\ncomplete men, unknown Napoleons, who are the type of its strength\ncarried to its highest expression, and sum up its social capacity in\nan existence wherein thought and movement combine less to bring joy\ninto it than to neutralize the action of sorrow.",
        "Chance has made an artisan economical, chance has favored him with\nforethought, he has been able to look forward, has met with a wife and\nfound himself a father, and, after some years of hard privation, he\nembarks in some little draper’s business, hires a shop. If neither\nsickness nor vice blocks his way–if he has prospered–there is the\nsketch of this normal life.",
        "And, in the first place, hail to that king of Parisian activity, to\nwhom time and space give way. Yes, hail to that being, composed of\nsaltpetre and gas, who makes children for France during his laborious\nnights, and in the day multiplies his personality for the service,\nglory, and pleasure of his fellow-citizens. This man solves the\nproblem of sufficing at once to his amiable wife, to his hearth, to\nthe Constitutionnel, to his office, to the National Guard, to the\nopera, and to God; but, only in order that the Constitutionnel, his\noffice, the National Guard, the opera, his wife, and God may be\nchanged into coin. In fine, hail to an irreproachable pluralist. Up\nevery day at five o’clock, he traverses like a bird the space which\nseparates his dwelling from the Rue Montmartre. Let it blow or\nthunder, rain or snow, he is at the Constitutionnel, and waits there\nfor the load of newspapers which he has undertaken to distribute. He\nreceives this political bread with eagerness, takes it, bears it away.\nAt nine o’clock he is in the bosom of his family, flings a jest to his\nwife, snatches a loud kiss from her, gulps down a cup of coffee, or\nscolds his children. At a quarter to ten he puts in an appearance at\nthe Mairie. There, stuck upon a stool, like a parrot on its perch,\nwarmed by Paris town, he registers until four o’clock, with never a\ntear or a smile, the deaths and births of an entire district. The\nsorrow, the happiness, of the parish flow beneath his pen–as the\nessence of the Constitutionnel traveled before upon his shoulders.\nNothing weighs upon him! He goes always straight before him, takes his\npatriotism ready made from the newspaper, contradicts no one, shouts\nor applauds with the world, and lives like a bird. Two yards from his\nparish, in the event of an important ceremony, he can yield his place\nto an assistant, and betake himself to chant a requiem from a stall in\nthe church of which on Sundays he is the fairest ornament, where his\nis the most imposing voice, where he distorts his huge mouth with\nenergy to thunder out a joyous Amen. So is he chorister. At four\no’clock, freed from his official servitude, he reappears to shed joy\nand gaiety upon the most famous shop in the city. Happy is his wife,\nhe has no time to be jealous: he is a man of action rather than of\nsentiment. His mere arrival spurs the young ladies at the counter;\ntheir bright eyes storm the customers; he expands in the midst of all\nthe finery, the lace and muslin kerchiefs, that their cunning hands\nhave wrought. Or, again, more often still, before his dinner he waits\non a client, copies the page of a newspaper, or carries to the\ndoorkeeper some goods that have been delayed. Every other day, at six,\nhe is faithful to his post. A permanent bass for the chorus, he\nbetakes himself to the opera, prepared to become a soldier or an arab,\nprisoner, savage, peasant, spirit, camel’s leg or lion, a devil or a\ngenie, a slave or a eunuch, black or white; always ready to feign joy\nor sorrow, pity or astonishment, to utter cries that never vary, to\nhold his tongue, to hunt, or fight for Rome or Egypt, but always at\nheart–a huckster still.",
        "At midnight he returns–a man, the good husband, the tender father; he\nslips into the conjugal bed, his imagination still afire with the\nillusive forms of the operatic nymphs, and so turns to the profit of\nconjugal love the world’s depravities, the voluptuous curves of\nTaglioni’s leg. And finally, if he sleeps, he sleeps apace, and\nhurries through his slumber as he does his life.",
        "This man sums up all things–history, literature, politics,\ngovernment, religion, military science. Is he not a living\nencyclopaedia, a grotesque Atlas; ceaselessly in motion, like Paris\nitself, and knowing not repose? He is all legs. No physiognomy could\npreserve its purity amid such toils. Perhaps the artisan who dies at\nthirty, an old man, his stomach tanned by repeated doses of brandy,\nwill be held, according to certain leisured philosophers, to be\nhappier than the huckster is. The one perishes in a breath, and the\nother by degrees. From his eight industries, from the labor of his\nshoulders, his throat, his hands, from his wife and his business, the\none derives–as from so many farms–children, some thousands of\nfrancs, and the most laborious happiness that has ever diverted the\nheart of man. This fortune and these children, or the children who sum\nup everything for him, become the prey of the world above, to which he\nbrings his ducats and his daughter or his son, reared at college, who,\nwith more education than his father, raises higher his ambitious gaze.\nOften the son of a retail tradesman would fain be something in the\nState.",
        "Ambition of that sort carries on our thought to the second Parisian\nsphere. Go up one story, then, and descend to the entresol: or climb\ndown from the attic and remain on the fourth floor; in fine, penetrate\ninto the world which has possessions: the same result! Wholesale\nmerchants, and their men–people with small banking accounts and much\nintegrity–rogues and catspaws, clerks old and young, sheriffs’\nclerks, barristers’ clerks, solicitors’ clerks; in fine, all the\nworking, thinking, and speculating members of that lower middle class\nwhich honeycombs the interests of Paris and watches over its granary,\naccumulates the coin, stores the products that the proletariat have\nmade, preserves the fruits of the South, the fishes, the wine from\nevery sun-favored hill; which stretches its hands over the Orient, and\ntakes from it the shawls that the Russ and the Turk despise; which\nharvests even from the Indies; crouches down in expectation of a sale,\ngreedy of profit; which discounts bills, turns over and collects all\nkinds of securities, holds all Paris in its hand, watches over the\nfantasies of children, spies out the caprices and the vices of mature\nage, sucks money out of disease. Even so, if they drink no brandy,\nlike the artisan, nor wallow in the mire of debauch, all equally abuse\ntheir strength, immeasurably strain their bodies and their minds\nalike, are burned away with desires, devastated with the swiftness of\nthe pace. In their case the physical distortion is accomplished\nbeneath the whip of interests, beneath the scourge of ambitions which\ntorture the educated portion of this monstrous city, just as in the\ncase of the proletariat it is brought about by the cruel see-saw of\nthe material elaborations perpetually required from the despotism of\nthe aristocratic ’I will.” Here, too, then, in order to obey that\nuniversal master, pleasure or gold, they must devour time, hasten\ntime, find more than four-and-twenty hours in the day and night, waste\nthemselves, slay themselves, and purchase two years of unhealthy\nrepose with thirty years of old age. Only, the working-man dies in\nhospital when the last term of his stunted growth expires; whereas the\nman of the middle class is set upon living, and lives on, but in a\nstate of idiocy. You will meet him, with his worn, flat old face, with\nno light in his eyes, with no strength in his limbs, dragging himself\nwith a dazed air along the boulevard–the belt of his Venus, of his\nbeloved city. What was his want? The sabre of the National Guard, a\npermanent stock-pot, a decent plot in Pere Lachaise, and, for his old\nage, a little gold honestly earned. HIS Monday is on Sunday, his\nrest a drive in a hired carriage–a country excursion during which his\nwife and children glut themselves merrily with dust or bask in the\nsun; his dissipation is at the restaurateur’s, whose poisonous dinner\nhas won renown, or at some family ball, where he suffocates till\nmidnight. Some fools are surprised at the phantasmagoria of the monads\nwhich they see with the aid of the microscope in a drop of water; but\nwhat would Rabelais’ Gargantua,–that misunderstood figure of an\naudacity so sublime,–what would that giant say, fallen from the\ncelestial spheres, if he amused himself by contemplating the motions\nof this secondary life of Paris, of which here is one of the formulae?\nHave you seen one of those little constructions–cold in summer, and\nwith no other warmth than a small stove in winter–placed beneath the\nvast copper dome which crowns the Halle-auble? Madame is there by\nmorning. She is engaged at the markets, and makes by this occupation\ntwelve thousand francs a year, people say. Monsieur, when Madame is\nup, passes into a gloomy office, where he lends money till the\nweek-end to the tradesmen of his district. By nine o’clock he is at\nthe passport office, of which he is one of the minor officials. By\nevening he is at the box-office of the Theatre Italien, or of any other\ntheatre you like. The children are put out to nurse, and only return\nto be sent to college or to boarding-school. Monsieur and Madame live\non the third floor, have but one cook, give dances in a salon twelve\nfoot by eight, lit by argand lamps; but they give a hundred and fifty\nthousand francs to their daughter, and retire at the age of fifty, an\nage when they begin to show themselves on the balcony of the opera, in\na fiacre at Longchamps; or, on sunny days, in faded clothes on the\nboulevards–the fruit of all this sowing. Respected by their\nneighbors, in good odor with the government, connected with the upper\nmiddle classes, Monsieur obtains at sixty-five the Cross of the Legion\nof Honor, and his daughter’s father-in-law, a parochial mayor, invites\nhim to his evenings. These life-long labors, then, are for the good of\nthe children, whom these lower middle classes are inevitably driven to\nexalt. Thus each sphere directs all its efforts towards the sphere\nabove it. The son of the rich grocer becomes a notary, the son of the\ntimber merchant becomes a magistrate. No link is wanting in the chain,\nand everything stimulates the upward march of money.",
        "Thus we are brought to the third circle of this hell, which, perhaps,\nwill some day find its Dante. In this third social circle, a sort of\nParisian belly, in which the interests of the town are digested, and\nwhere they are condensed into the form known as business, there\nmoves and agitates, as by some acrid and bitter intestinal process,\nthe crowd of lawyers, doctors, notaries, councillors, business men,\nbankers, big merchants, speculators, and magistrates. Here are to be\nfound even more causes of moral and physical destruction than\nelsewhere. These people–almost all of them–live in unhealthy\noffices, in fetid ante-chambers, in little barred dens, and spend\ntheir days bowed down beneath the weight of affairs; they rise at dawn\nto be in time, not to be left behind, to gain all or not to lose, to\noverreach a man or his money, to open or wind up some business, to\ntake advantage of some fleeting opportunity, to get a man hanged or\nset him free. They infect their horses, they overdrive and age and\nbreak them, like their own legs, before their time. Time is their\ntyrant: it fails them, it escapes them; they can neither expand it nor\ncut it short. What soul can remain great, pure, moral, and generous,\nand, consequently, what face retain its beauty in this depraving\npractice of a calling which compels one to bear the weight of the\npublic sorrows, to analyze them, to weigh them, estimate them, and\nmark them out by rule? Where do these folk put aside their\nhearts? . . . I do not know; but they leave them somewhere or other,\nwhen they have any, before they descend each morning into the abyss of\nthe misery which puts families on the rack. For them there is no such\nthing as mystery; they see the reverse side of society, whose\nconfessors they are, and despise it. Then, whatever they do, owing to\ntheir contact with corruption, they either are horrified at it and\ngrow gloomy, or else, out of lassitude, or some secret compromise,\nespouse it. In fine, they necessarily become callous to every\nsentiment, since man, his laws and his institutions, make them steal,\nlike jackals, from corpses that are still warm. At all hours the\nfinancier is trampling on the living, the attorney on the dead, the\npleader on the conscience. Forced to be speaking without a rest, they\nall substitute words for ideas, phrases for feelings, and their soul\nbecomes a larynx. Neither the great merchant, nor the judge, nor the\npleader preserves his sense of right; they feel no more, they apply\nset rules that leave cases out of count. Borne along by their headlong\ncourse, they are neither husbands nor fathers nor lovers; they glide\non sledges over the facts of life, and live at all times at the high\npressure conduced by business and the vast city. When they return to\ntheir homes they are required to go to a ball, to the opera, into\nsociety, where they can make clients, acquaintances, protectors. They\nall eat to excess, play and keep vigil, and their faces become\nbloated, flushed, and emaciated.",
        "To this terrific expenditure of intellectual strength, to such\nmultifold moral contradictions, they oppose–not, indeed pleasure, it\nwould be too pale a contrast–but debauchery, a debauchery both secret\nand alarming, for they have all means at their disposal, and fix the\nmorality of society. Their genuine stupidity lies hid beneath their\nspecialism. They know their business, but are ignorant of everything\nwhich is outside it. So that to preserve their self-conceit they\nquestion everything, are crudely and crookedly critical. They appear\nto be sceptics and are in reality simpletons; they swamp their wits in\ninterminable arguments. Almost all conveniently adopt social,\nliterary, or political prejudices, to do away with the need of having\nopinions, just as they adapt their conscience to the standard of the\nCode or the Tribunal of Commerce. Having started early to become men\nof note, they turn into mediocrities, and crawl over the high places\nof the world. So, too, their faces present the harsh pallor, the\ndeceitful coloring, those dull, tarnished eyes, and garrulous, sensual\nmouths, in which the observer recognizes the symptoms of the\ndegeneracy of the thought and its rotation in the circle of a special\nidea which destroys the creative faculties of the brain and the gift\nof seeing in large, of generalizing and deducing. No man who has\nallowed himself to be caught in the revolutions of the gear of these\nhuge machines can ever become great. If he is a doctor, either he has\npractised little or he is an exception–a Bichat who dies young. If a\ngreat merchant, something remains–he is almost Jacques Coeur. Did\nRobespierre practise? Danton was an idler who waited. But who,\nmoreover has ever felt envious of the figures of Danton and\nRobespierre, however lofty they were? These men of affairs, par\nexcellence, attract money to them, and hoard it in order to ally\nthemselves with aristocratic families. If the ambition of the\nworking-man is that of the small tradesman, here, too, are the same\npassions. The type of this class might be either an ambitious\nbourgeois, who, after a life of privation and continual scheming,\npasses into the Council of State as an ant passes through a chink; or\nsome newspaper editor, jaded with intrigue, whom the king makes a peer\nof France–perhaps to revenge himself on the nobility; or some notary\nbecome mayor of his parish: all people crushed with business, who, if\nthey attain their end, are literally killed in its attainment. In\nFrance the usage is to glorify wigs. Napoleon, Louis XVI., the great\nrulers, alone have always wished for young men to fulfil their\nprojects.",
        "Above this sphere the artist world exists. But here, too, the faces\nstamped with the seal of originality are worn, nobly indeed, but worn,\nfatigued, nervous. Harassed by a need of production, outrun by their\ncostly fantasies, worn out by devouring genius, hungry for pleasure,\nthe artists of Paris would all regain by excessive labor what they\nhave lost by idleness, and vainly seek to reconcile the world and\nglory, money and art. To begin with, the artist is ceaselessly panting\nunder his creditors; his necessities beget his debts, and his debts\nrequire of him his nights. After his labor, his pleasure. The comedian\nplays till midnight, studies in the morning, rehearses at noon; the\nsculptor is bent before his statue; the journalist is a marching\nthought, like the soldier when at war; the painter who is the fashion\nis crushed with work, the painter with no occupation, if he feels\nhimself to be a man of genius, gnaws his entrails. Competition,\nrivalry, calumny assail talent. Some, in desperation, plunge into the\nabyss of vice, others die young and unknown because they have\ndiscounted their future too soon. Few of these figures, originally\nsublime, remain beautiful. On the other hand, the flagrant beauty of\ntheir heads is not understood. An artist’s face is always exorbitant,\nit is always above or below the conventional lines of what fools call\nthe beau-ideal. What power is it that destroys them? Passion. Every\npassion in Paris resolves into two terms: gold and pleasure. Now, do\nyou not breathe again? Do you not feel air and space purified? Here is\nneither labor nor suffering. The soaring arch of gold has reached the\nsummit. From the lowest gutters, where its stream commences, from the\nlittle shops where it is stopped by puny coffer-dams, from the heart\nof the counting-houses and great workshops, where its volume is that\nof ingots–gold, in the shape of dowries and inheritances, guided by\nthe hands of young girls or the bony fingers of age, courses towards\nthe aristocracy, where it will become a blazing, expansive stream.\nBut, before leaving the four territories upon which the utmost wealth\nof Paris is based, it is fitting, having cited the moral causes, to\ndeduce those which are physical, and to call attention to a\npestilence, latent, as it were, which incessantly acts upon the faces\nof the porter, the artisan, the small shopkeeper; to point out a\ndeleterious influence the corruption of which equals that of the\nParisian administrators who allow it so complacently to exist!",
        "If the air of the houses in which the greater proportion of the middle\nclasses live is noxious, if the atmosphere of the streets belches out\ncruel miasmas into stuffy back-kitchens where there is little air,\nrealize that, apart from this pestilence, the forty thousand houses of\nthis great city have their foundations in filth, which the powers that\nbe have not yet seriously attempted to enclose with mortar walls solid\nenough to prevent even the most fetid mud from filtering through the\nsoil, poisoning the wells, and maintaining subterraneously to Lutetia\nthe tradition of her celebrated name. Half of Paris sleeps amidst the\nputrid exhalations of courts and streets and sewers. But let us turn\nto the vast saloons, gilded and airy; the hotels in their gardens, the\nrich, indolent, happy moneyed world. There the faces are lined and\nscarred with vanity. There nothing is real. To seek for pleasure is it\nnot to find ennui? People in society have at an early age warped\ntheir nature. Having no occupation other than to wallow in pleasure,\nthey have speedily misused their sense, as the artisan has misused\nbrandy. Pleasure is of the nature of certain medical substances: in\norder to obtain constantly the same effects the doses must be doubled,\nand death or degradation is contained in the last. All the lower\nclasses are on their knees before the wealthy, and watch their tastes\nin order to turn them into vices and exploit them. Thus you see in\nthese folk at an early age tastes instead of passions, romantic\nfantasies and lukewarm loves. There impotence reigns; there ideas have\nceased–they have evaporated together with energy amongst the\naffectations of the boudoir and the cajolements of women. There are\nfledglings of forty, old doctors of sixty years. The wealthy obtain in\nParis ready-made wit and science–formulated opinions which save them\nthe need of having wit, science, or opinion of their own. The\nirrationality of this world is equaled by its weakness and its\nlicentiousness. It is greedy of time to the point of wasting it. Seek\nin it for affection as little as for ideas. Its kisses conceal a\nprofound indifference, its urbanity a perpetual contempt. It has no\nother fashion of love. Flashes of wit without profundity, a wealth of\nindiscretion, scandal, and above all, commonplace. Such is the sum of\nits speech; but these happy fortunates pretend that they do not meet\nto make and repeat maxims in the manner of La Rochefoucauld as though\nthere did not exist a mean, invented by the eighteenth century,\nbetween a superfluity and absolute blank. If a few men of character\nindulge in witticism, at once subtle and refined, they are\nmisunderstood; soon, tired of giving without receiving, they remain at\nhome, and leave fools to reign over their territory. This hollow life,\nthis perpetual expectation of a pleasure which never comes, this\npermanent ennui and emptiness of soul, heart, and mind, the\nlassitude of the upper Parisian world, is reproduced on its features,\nand stamps its parchment faces, its premature wrinkles, that\nphysiognomy of the wealthy upon which impotence has set its grimace,\nin which gold is mirrored, and whence intelligence has fled.",
        "Such a view of moral Paris proves that physical Paris could not be\nother than it is. This coroneted town is like a queen, who, being\nalways with child, has desires of irresistible fury. Paris is the\ncrown of the world, a brain which perishes of genius and leads human\ncivilization; it is a great man, a perpetually creative artist, a\npolitician with second-sight who must of necessity have wrinkles on\nhis forehead, the vices of a great man, the fantasies of the artist,\nand the politician’s disillusions. Its physiognomy suggests the\nevolution of good and evil, battle and victory; the moral combat of\n’89, the clarion calls of which still re-echo in every corner of the\nworld; and also the downfall of 1814. Thus this city can no more be\nmoral, or cordial, or clean, than the engines which impel those proud\nleviathans which you admire when they cleave the waves! Is not Paris a\nsublime vessel laden with intelligence? Yes, her arms are one of those\noracles which fatality sometimes allows. The City of Paris has her\ngreat mast, all of bronze, carved with victories, and for watchman\n–Napoleon. The barque may roll and pitch, but she cleaves the world,\nilluminates it through the hundred mouths of her tribunes, ploughs the\nseas of science, rides with full sail, cries from the height of her\ntops, with the voice of her scientists and artists: “Onward, advance!\nFollow me!” She carries a huge crew, which delights in adorning her\nwith fresh streamers. Boys and urchins laughing in the rigging;\nballast of heavy bourgeoisie; working-men and sailor-men touched\nwith tar; in her cabins the lucky passengers; elegant midshipmen smoke\ntheir cigars leaning over the bulwarks; then, on the deck, her\nsoldiers, innovators or ambitious, would accost every fresh shore, and\nshooting out their bright lights upon it, ask for glory which is\npleasure, or for love which needs gold.",
        "Thus the exorbitant movement of the proletariat, the corrupting\ninfluence of the interests which consume the two middle classes, the\ncruelties of the artist’s thought, and the excessive pleasure which is\nsought for incessantly by the great, explain the normal ugliness of\nthe Parisian physiognomy. It is only in the Orient that the human race\npresents a magnificent figure, but that is an effect of the constant\ncalm affected by those profound philosophers with their long pipes,\ntheir short legs, their square contour, who despise and hold activity\nin horror, whilst in Paris the little and the great and the mediocre\nrun and leap and drive, whipped on by an inexorable goddess, Necessity\n–the necessity for money, glory, and amusement. Thus, any face which\nis fresh and graceful and reposeful, any really young face, is in\nParis the most extraordinary of exceptions; it is met with rarely.\nShould you see one there, be sure it belongs either to a young and\nardent ecclesiastic or to some good abbe of forty with three chins; to\na young girl of pure life such as is brought up in certain\nmiddle-class families; to a mother of twenty, still full of illusions,\nas she suckles her first-born; to a young man newly embarked from the\nprovinces, and intrusted to the care of some devout dowager who keeps\nhim without a sou; or, perhaps, to some shop assistant who goes to bed\nat midnight wearied out with folding and unfolding calico, and rises\nat seven o’clock to arrange the window; often again to some man of\nscience or poetry, who lives monastically in the embrace of a fine\nidea, who remains sober, patient, and chaste; else to some\nself-contented fool, feeding himself on folly, reeking of health, in a\nperpetual state of absorption with his own smile; or to the soft and\nhappy race of loungers, the only folk really happy in Paris, which\nunfolds for them hour by hour its moving poetry.",
