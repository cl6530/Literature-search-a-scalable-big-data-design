        "Charles Pickney Sumner, the father of Charles Sumner, was a man of an\nessentially veracious nature. He was high sheriff of Suffolk County,\nMassachusetts, and when there was a criminal to be executed he always\nperformed the office himself. Once when some one inquired why he did not\ndelegate such a disagreeable task to one of his deputies, he is said to\nhave replied, “Simply because it is disagreeable.” It was this elevated\nsense of moral responsibility which formed the keynote of his son’s\ncharacter.",
        "Charles Sumner’s mother was Miss Relief Jacobs, a name in which we\ndistinguish at once a mixture of the Hebrew and the Puritan. She belonged\nin fact to a Christianized Jewish family, but how long since her\nancestors became Christianized remains in doubt. Yet it is easy to\nrecognize the Hebrew element in Sumner’s nature; the inflexibility of\npurpose, the absolute self-devotion, and even the prophetic forecast.\nSumner was an old Hebrew prophet in the guise of an American statesman.\nTrue to his mother’s name, he was at once a Puritan and an Israelite in\nwhom there was no guile; for he was wholly exempt from covetousness and\nother meaner qualities of the Hebrew nature. In such respects Jews and\nYankees are much alike. Either they are generous and high-minded, or they\nare not.",
        "Charles was rather a peculiar boy, as great men are apt to be in their\nyouth. He cared little for boyish games, and still less for the bright\neyes of the girls. He had remarkably long arms and legs, which were too\noften in the way of his comrades, and from which he derived the nickname\nat the Latin-School of “gawky Sumner\"; and it may be well to notice here\nthat there is no better sign for future superiority than for a lad to be\nridiculed in this manner; while the wags who invent such sobriquets\nusually come to no good end. [Footnote: More than one such has died the\ndeath of an inebriate.] There is sufficient evidence, however, that\nSumner was well liked both at school and at college.",
        "He had his revenge on declamation day, for whereas others stumbled\nthrough their pieces, he seemed perfectly at home on the platform; his\nawkwardness disappeared and his performance gave plain indications of the\nfuture orator. Wendell Phillips was in the class after him, and they both\nwere excellent speakers.",
        "Sumner’s early life was not like that of Lincoln, neither was he obliged\nto split rails for a living; but it was a life of good stoical training\nnevertheless. Sheriff Sumner had eight children living at one time, and\nwith the natural desire to give them as good an education as his own, he\ncould not afford to spend much on external elegances. It was not until\nCharles had become a distinguished lawyer that his mother dispensed with\nthe iron forks and spoons on her dinner table; and this gives a fair idea\nof their domestic economy. We learn from Pierce’s biography that his\ncollege expenses did not exceed two hundred dollars a year; and this\nincluded everything.",
        "He entered at Harvard in the class of 1830; a year after Doctor Holmes\nand a year before Wendell Phillips. Much more is known concerning his\ncollege life than that of other distinguished men of that time, and it is\nhighly interesting to recognize the mature man foreshadowed in the youth\nof eighteen. He was a good scholar in everything but mathematics; yet, at\nthe same time, he cared little for rank. He was an enthusiastic reader,\nand sometimes neglected his studies for a book in which he was more\ndeeply interested. He also liked to converse about the books he read, and\nin this way acquired a reputation for loquacity which never left him as\nlong as he lived. It was sometimes troublesome to his friends, but it was\nof great advantage to him as a public speaker. He lived a quiet, sober,\nindustrious life in college, attracting comparatively little attention\nfrom either his instructors or his fellow students. Yet, he showed the\nindependence of his character by attending a cattle-show at Brighton, a\nproceeding for which he would have been suspended if it had been\ndiscovered by the college faculty. There were many foolish, monkish\nrestrictions at Harvard in those days, and among them it was not\nconsidered decorous for a student to wear a colored vest. He might wear a\nwhite vest, but not a buff or a figured one. Sumner preferred a buff\nvest, and insisted on wearing it. When he was reprimanded for doing so he\ndefended his course vigorously, and exposed the absurdity of the\nregulation in such plain terms that the faculty concluded to let him\nalone for the future. [Footnote: In 1860 he still continued to wear a buff\nvest in summer weather.] He was exceedingly fond of the Greek and Latin\nauthors, and quoted from them in his letters at this time, as he did\nafterwards in his speeches. His college course was not a brilliant one\nlike Everett’s and Phillips’s, but seems to have been based on a more\nsolid ground-work.",
        "It was in the Law-School that Sumner first distinguished himself. Judge\nStory, who had left the United States Supreme Bench to become a Harvard\nprofessor, was the chief luminary of the school and the finest instructor\nin law of his time. He soon discovered in Sumner a pupil after his own\nheart, and in spite of the disparity of their ages they became intimate\nfriends. This is the more significant because Phillips was also in the\nsame class, and the more brilliant scholar of the two; but Judge Story\nsoon discovered that Phillips was studying as a means to an end, while\nSumner’s interest in the law was like that of a great artist who works\nfrom the pure love of his subject.",
        "William W. Story, who was a boy at this time, records the fact that\nSumner was always pleasant and kind to children.",
        "At the age of twenty-four Charles Sumner was himself appointed an\ninstructor at the Law-School; and during the two following years he\nedited the reports of Judge Story’s decisions in the United States\nCircuit Courts.",
        "It is evident from James Russell Lowell’s “Fable for Critics” that the\npersonalities of his contemporaries troubled him: he could not see over\ntheir heads. In 1837 Sumner went to Europe and we find from his letters\nto Judge Story, George S. Hillard, and others, that he had already\nobtained a vantage ground from which the civilized world lay before him,\nas all New England does from the top of Mount Washington. He goes into a\nFrench law court, and analyzes the procedure of French justice in a\nletter which has the value of an historical document. He noticed that\nNapoleon was still spoken of as l’Empereur, although there was a\nking in France,—a fact pregnant with future consequences. He remained in\nParis until he was a complete master of the French language, and attended\none hundred and fifty lectures at the university and elsewhere. He\nenjoyed the grand opera and the acting in French theatres; nor did he\nneglect to study Italian art. He was making a whole man of himself; and\nit seemed as if an unconscious instinct was guiding him to his destiny.",
        "Fortunate was the old Sheriff to have such a son; but Charles Sumner was\nalso fortunate to have had a father who was willing to save and economize\nfor his benefit. Otherwise he might have been a sheriff himself.",
        "Judge Story’s letters of introduction opened the doors wide to him in\nEngland. In the course of ten months he became acquainted with almost\nevery distinguished person in the United Kingdom. He never asked for\nintroductions, and he never presented himself without one. He was handed\nfrom one mansion to another all the way from London to the Scotch\nHighlands. Only twenty-seven years of age, he was treated on an equality\nby men ten to fifteen years his senior; and he proved himself equal to\ntheir expectations. No American except Lowell has ever made such a\nfavorable impression in England as Sumner; but this happened in Sumner’s\nyouth, while Lowell in his earlier visits attracted little attention.",
        "It is perfectly true that if he had been the son of an English sheriff\nthis would not have happened; but he encountered the same obstacles in\nBoston society that he would have done under similar conditions in Great\nBritain. The doors of Wentworth House and Strachan Park were open to him,\nbut those of Beacon Street were closed,—and perhaps it was better for\nhim on the whole that they were.",
        "Sumner’s letters from Europe are at least as interesting as those written\nby any other American. Such breadth of vision is not often united with\nclearness and accuracy of detail. All his letters ought to be published\nin a volume by themselves. Sumner returned to America the following year\nand settled himself quietly and soberly to his work as a lawyer. He was\nnot a success, however, as a practitioner in the courts, unless he could\nplead before a bench of judges. In the Common Pleas an ordinary\npettifogger would often take a case away from him. He could not, if he\nwould, have practised those seductive arts by which Rufus Choate drew the\njury into his net, in spite of their deliberate intentions to the\ncontrary. Yet, Sumner’s reputation steadily improved, so that when\nLongfellow came to live in Cambridge he found Sumner delivering lectures\nat the Harvard Law-School, where he might have remained the rest of his\nlife, if he had been satisfied with a merely routine employment, and the\nfortunes of the republic had not decided differently.",
        "The attraction between Sumner and Longfellow was immediate and permanent.\nIt was owing more perhaps to the essential purity of their natures, than\nto mutual sympathy in regard to art and literature; although Longfellow\nheld Sumner’s literary judgment in such respect that he rarely published\na new poem without first subjecting his work to Sumner’s criticism.",
        "Those who admired Sumner at this time, for his fine moral and\nintellectual qualities, had no adequate conception of the far nobler\nquality which lay concealed in the depths of his nature. Charles Sumner\nwas a hero,—one to whom life was nothing in comparison with his duty.",
        "It was in the anti-Irish riot of June, 1837, that he first gave evidence\nof this. Nothing was more hateful to him than race prejudice, and what\nmight be called international malignity, which he believed was the most\nfrequent cause of war.",
        "As soon as Sumner was notified of the disturbance, he hastened to the\nscene of action, seized on a prominent position, and attempted to address\nthe insurgents; but his pacific words only excited them to greater fury.\nThey charged on him and his little group of supporters, knocked him down\nand trampled on him. Dr. S. G. Howe, who stood near by, a born fighter,\nprotected Sumner’s prostrate body, and finally carried him to a place of\nsafety, although twice his own size. Sumner took his mishap very coolly,\nand, as soon as he could talk freely, addressed his friends on the evils\nresulting from race prejudice.",
        "This incident may have led Sumner to the choice of a subject for his\nFourth of July oration in 1845. The title of this address was “The True\nGrandeur of Nations,” but its real object was one which Sumner always had\nat heart, and never relinquished the hope of,—namely, the establishment\nof an international tribunal, which should possess jurisdiction over the\ndifferences and quarrels between nations, and so bring warfare forever to\nan end. The plan is an impracticable one, because the decisions of a\ncourt only have validity if it is able to enforce them, and how could the\ndecisions of an international tribunal have value in case the parties\nconcerned declined to accept them? It would only result in waging war in\norder to prevent war. Yet, of all the Fourth of July orations that were\ndelivered in the nineteenth century, Sumner’s and Webster’s are the only\ntwo that have survived; and the “True Grandeur of Nations” has recently\nbeen published by the London Peace Society as an argument in favor of\ntheir philanthropic movement.",
        "Sumner was now in the prime of manhood, and a rarely handsome man. He had\nan heroic figure, six feet two inches in height, and well proportioned in\nall respects. His features, too large and heavy in his youth, had become\nstrong and regular, and although he had not acquired that leonine look of\nreserved power with which he confronted the United States Senate, his\nexpression was frank and fearless. As L. Maria Child, who heard him\nfrequently, said, he seemed to be as much in his place on the platform as\na statue on its pedestal. His gestures had not the natural grace of\nPhillips’s or the more studied elegance of Everett, but he atoned for\nthese deficiencies by the manly earnestness of his delivery. He made\nan impression on the highly cultivated men and women who composed his\naudience which they always remembered.",
        "The question has often been raised by the older abolitionists, “Why did\nnot Sumner take an earlier interest in the anti-slavery struggle?” The\nanswer is twofold. That he did not join the Free-soilers in 1844 was most\nprobably owing to the influence of Judge Story, who had already marked\nSumner out for the Supreme Bench, and wished him to concentrate his\nenergies in that direction. His friends, too, at this time—Hillard,\nFelton, Liebe, and even Longfellow—were either opposed to introducing\nthe slavery question into politics or practically indifferent to it.",
        "On the other hand, Sumner never could agree with Garrison’s position on\nthis question. He held the Constitution in too great respect to admit\nthat it was an agreement with death and a government with the devil. He\nbelieved that the founders of the Constitution were opposed to slavery,\nand that the expression, “persons held to labor,” was good evidence of\nthis. One of his finest orations in the Senate was intended to prove this\npoint. Furthermore he perceived the futility of Garrison’s idea—and this\nwas afterwards disproved by the war—that if it were not for the National\nGovernment the slaves would rise in rebellion and so obtain their\nfreedom. He always asserted that slavery would be abolished under the\nConstitution or not at all. Like Abraham Lincoln he waited for his time\nto come.",
        "Charles Sumner was the reply that Massachusetts made to the Fugitive\nSlave Law, and a telling reply it was. Unlike his legal contemporaries he\nrecognized the law as a revolutionary act which, unless it was\nsuccessfully opposed, would strike a death-blow at American freedom. He\nsaw that it could only be met by counter-revolution, and he prepared his\nmind for the consequences. It was only at such a time that so\nuncompromising a statesman as Sumner could have entered into political\nlife; for the possibility of compromise had passed away with the\nsuspension of the writ of habeas corpus, and Sumner’s policy of\n“no compromise” was the one which brought the slavery question to a\nsuccessful issue. For fifteen years in Congress he held to that policy as\nfaithfully as a planet to its course, and those who differed with him\nwere left in the rear.",
        "Sumner’s first difference was with his conservative friends, and\nespecially with his law-partner, George S. Hillard, a brilliant man in\nhis way, and for an introductory address without a rival in Boston.\nHillard was at heart as anti-slavery as Sumner, and his wife had even\nassisted fugitive slaves, but he was swathed in the bands of fashionable\nsociety, and he lacked the courage to break loose from them. He adhered\nto the Whigs and was relegated to private life. They parted without\nacrimony, and Sumner never failed to do his former friend a service when\nhe found an opportunity.",
        "His difference with Felton was of a more serious kind. Emerson, perhaps,\njudged Felton too severely,—a man of ardent temperament who was always\nin danger of saying more than he intended.",
        "Sumner’s election to the Senate was a chance in ten thousand. It is well\nknown that at first he declined to be a candidate. He did not think he\nwas fitted for the position, and when Caleb Gushing urged him to court\nthe favor of fortune he said: “I will not leave my chair to become United\nStates Senator.” Whatever vanity there might be in the man, he was\nentirely free from the ambition for power and place.",
        "There were several prominent public men at the time who would have given\nall they owned for the position, but they were set aside for the man who\ndid not want it,—the bold jurist who dared to set himself against the\nveteran statesmen of his country. It reads like a Bible-tale, or the\nstory of Cincinnatus taken from his plow to become dictator.",
        "The gates of his alma mater were now closed to Sumner, not only\nduring his life but even long after that. Such is the fate of\nrevolutionary characters, that they tear asunder old and familiar bonds\nin order to contract new ties. In Washington he found a broader and more\nvigorous life, if less cultivated, and the Free-soil leaders with whom he\nnow came in contact in his own State were much more akin to his own\nnature than Story, and Felton, and Hillard. Sumner was never popular in\nWashington, as he had been among the English liberals and Cambridge men\nof letters; but he was respected on all sides for his fearlessness, his\nability, and the veracity of his statements. His previous life now proved\na great advantage to him in most respects, but he had become accustomed\nto dealing and conversing with a certain class of men, and this made it\ndifficult for him to assimilate himself to a wholly different class.\nSumner’s ardent temperament required constant self-control in this new\nand trying position; and a man who continually reflects beforehand on his\nown actions acquires an appearance of greater reserve than a person of\nreally cold nature.",
        "Seward had thus far been the leader of the Free-soil and Republican\nparties, not only before the country at large but in the Senate. It was\nsoon found, however, that Sumner was not only a more effective speaker,\nbut possessed greater resources for debate. Judge Story had noticed long\nbefore that facts were so carefully and systematically arranged in\nSumner’s mind that whatever spring was touched he could always respond to\nthe subject with a full and exact statement. He was like a librarian who\ncould lay his hand on the book he wanted without having to look for it in\nthe catalogue,—and this upon a scale which seems almost incredible.\nWebster possessed the same faculty, but united it with a sense of\nartistic beauty which Sumner could not equal.",
        "Sumner, however, was the best orator in Congress at this time, as well as\nthe best legal authority. On all constitutional questions it was felt\nthat he had Judge Story’s support behind him. His oration on “Freedom\nNational, Slavery Sectional,” was a revelation, not only to the\nopposition, but to his own party. From that time forth, he became the\nspokesman of his party on all the more important questions.",
        "It frequently happens that the essential character of a government\nchanges while its form remains the same. In 1801 France was nominally a\nRepublic, but its administration was Imperial. In 1853 the United States\nceased to be a democracy and became an oligarchy, governed by thirty\nthousand slave-holders,—until the people reconquered their rights on the\nfield of battle. Accustomed to despotic power in their own States for\nmore than two generations, and justifying themselves always by divine\nright, the slave-holders possessed all the self-confidence, pretension,\nand arrogance of the old French nobility. They were a self-deluded class\nof men, of all classes the most difficult to deal with, and Sumner was\nthe Mirabeau who faced them at Washington and who pricked the bubble of\ntheir Olympian pretensions by a most pitiless exposure of their true\ncharacter.",
        "Those men had come to believe that the ownership of slaves was equivalent\nto a patent of nobility, and they were encouraged in this monarchical\nillusion by the nobility of Europe. In Disraeli’s “Lothair” an English\nduke is made to say: “I consider an American with large estates in the\nSouth a genuine aristocrat.” The pretension was ridiculous, and the only\nway to combat it was to make it appear so. Sumner characterized Butler,\nof South Carolina, and Douglas, of Illinois, who was their northern man\nof business, as the Don Quixote and Sancho Panza of an antiquated cause.\nThe satire hit its mark only too exactly; and two days later Sumner was\nassaulted for it in an assassin-like manner,—struck on the head from\nbehind while writing at his desk, and left senseless on the floor. Sumner\nwas considered too low in the social scale for the customary challenge to\na duel, and there was no court in Washington that would take cognizance\nof the outrage.",
        "The following day, when Wilson made the most eloquent speech of his life\nin an indignant rebuke to Butler and Brooks, Butler started from his seat\nto attack him, but was held back by his friends. They might as well have\nallowed him to go, for Wilson was a man of enormous strength and could\neasily have handled any Southerner upon the floor.",
        "In “The Crime against Kansas” there are two or three sentences which\nSumner afterwards expunged, and this shows that he regretted having said\nthem; but it is the greatest of his orations, and Webster’s reply to\nHayne is the only Congressional address with which it can be compared.\nOne is in fact the sequence of the other; Webster’s is the flower, and\nSumner’s the fruit; the former directed against the active principle of\nsedition, and the latter against its consequences; and both were directed\nagainst South Carolina, where the war originated. Sumner’s speech has not\nthe finely sculptured character of Webster’s, but its architectural\nstructure is grand and impressive. His Baconian division of the various\nexcuses that were made for the Kansas outrages into “the apology\ntyrannical, the apology imbecile, the apology absurd, and the apology\ninfamous,” was original and pertinent.",
        "Preston S. Brooks only lived about six months after his assault on\nSumner, and some of the abolitionists thought he died of a guilty\nconscience. Both in feature and expression he bore a decided likeness to\nJ. Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Lincoln. It might have proved\nthe death of Sumner, but for the devotion of his Boston physician, Dr.\nMarshall S. Perry, who went to him without waiting to be telegraphed for.\nIt was also fortunate for him that his brother George, a very intelligent\nman, happened to be in America instead of Europe, where he lived the\ngreater part of his life. The assault on Sumner strengthened the\nRepublican party, and secured his re-election to the Senate; but it\nproduced nervous irritation of the brain and spinal cord, a disorder\nwhich can only be cured under favorable conditions, and even then is\nlikely to return if the patient is exposed to a severe mental strain.\nSumner’s cure by Dr. Brown-Sequard was considered a remarkable one, and\nhas a place in the history of medicine. The effect of bromide and ergot\nwas then unknown, and the doctor made such good use of his cauterizing-\niron that on one occasion, at least, Sumner declared that he could not\nendure it any longer. Neither could he tell positively whether it was\nthis treatment or the baths which he afterwards took at Aix-les-Bains\nthat finally cured him. His own calm temperament and firmness of mind may\nhave contributed to this as much as Dr. Brown-Sequard.",
        "When Sumner returned to Boston, early in 1860, all his friends went to\nDr. S. G. Howe to know if he was really cured, and Howe said: “He is a\nwell man, but he will never be able to make another two hours’ speech.\"\nYet Sumner trained himself and tested his strength so carefully that in\nthe following spring he delivered his oration on the barbarism of\nslavery, more than an hour in length, before the Senate; and in 1863 he\nmade a speech three hours in length, a herculean effort that has never\nbeen equalled, except by Hamilton’s address before the Constitutional\nConvention of 1787.",
        "I remember Sumner in the summer of 1860 walking under my father’s grape\ntrellis, when the vines were in blossom, with his arms above his head,\nand saying: “This is like the south of France.” To think of Europe, its\nart, history, and scenery, was his relaxation from the cares and\nexcitement of politics; but there were many who did not understand this,\nand looked upon it as an affectation. Sumner in his least serious moments\nwas often self-conscious, but never affected. He talked of himself as an\ninnocent child talks. On all occasions he was thoroughly real and\nsincere, and he would sometimes be as much abashed by a genuine\ncompliment as a maiden of seventeen.",
        "At the same time Sumner was so great a man that it was simply impossible\nto disguise it, and he made no attempt to do this. The principle that all\nmen are created equal did not apply in his case. To realize this it was\nonly necessary to see him and Senator Wilson together. Wilson was also a\nman of exceptional ability, and yet a stranger, who did not know him by\nsight, might have conversed with him on a railway train without\nsuspecting that he was a member of the United States Senate; but this\ncould not have happened in Sumner’s case. Every one stared at him as he\nwalked the streets; and he could not help becoming conscious of this.\nThat there were moments when he seemed to reflect with satisfaction on\nhis past life his best friends could not deny; but the vanity that is\nborn of a frivolous spirit was not in him. He was more like a Homeric\nhero than a Sir Philip Sidney, and considering the work he had to do it\nwas better on the whole that he should be so.",
        "He carried the impracticable theory of social equality to an extent\nbeyond that of most Americans, and yet he was frequently complained of\nfor his reserve and aristocratic manners. The range of his acquaintance\nwas the widest of any man of his time. It extended from Lord Brougham to\nJ. B. Smith, the mulatto caterer of Boston, who, like many of his race,\nwas a person of gentlemanly deportment, and was always treated by Sumner\nas a valued friend. As the champion of the colored race in the Senate\nthis was diplomatically necessary; but to the rank and file of his own\nparty he was less gracious. He had not grown up among them, but had\nentered politics at the top, so that even their faces were unfamiliar to\nhim. The representatives of Massachusetts, who voted for him at the State\nHouse, were sometimes chagrined at the coldness of his recognition,—a\ncoldness that did not arise from lack of sympathy, but from ignorance of\nthe individual. Before Sumner could treat a stranger in a friendly\nmanner, he wished to know what sort of a person he had to deal with.\nThere is a kind of insincerity in universal cordiality,—like that of the\ncandidate who is seeking to obtain votes.",
        "A recent writer, who complains of Sumner’s lack of graciousness, would do\nwell to ask his conscience what the reason for it was. If he will drop\nthe three last letters of his own name the solution will be apparent to\nhim.",
        "The more Sumner became absorbed in public affairs the less he seemed to\nbe suited to general society,—or general society to him. He was always\nready to talk on those subjects that interested him, but in general\nconversation, in the pleasant give-and-take of wit and anecdote, he did\nnot feel so much at home as he had in his Cambridge days. His thoughts\nwere too serious, and the tendency of his mind was argumentative.",
        "Every man is to a certain extent the victim of his occupation; and the\nformalities of the Senate were ever tightening their grasp on Sumner’s\nmode of life. One afternoon, as he was leaving Dr. Howe’s garden at South\nBoston, the doctor’s youngest daughter ran out from the house, and called\nto him, “Good-bye, Mr. Sumner.” His back was already turned, but he faced\nabout like an officer on parade, and said with formal gravity: “Good\nevening, child,” so that Mrs. Howe could not avoid laughing at him. Yet\nSumner was fond of children in his youth. L. Maria Child heard of this\nincident and made good use of it in one of her story-books.",
        "The grand fact in Sumner’s character, however, rests beyond dispute that\nhe never aspired to the Presidency. That lingering Washington malady\nwhich victimized Clay, Webster, Calhoun, Seward, Chase, Sherman, and\nBlaine, and made them appear almost like sinners in torment, never\nattacked Sumner. He had accepted office as a patriotic duty, and, like\nWashington, he was ready to resign it whenever his work would be done.",
        "Sumner’s speech on the barbarism of slavery, timed as it was to meet the\nBaltimore convention, was evidently intended to drive a wedge into the\nsplit between the Northern and Southern Democrats, but it also must have\nencouraged the secession movement. Sumner, however, can hardly be blamed\nfor this, after the indignity he had suffered. That a high member of the\nGovernment could have been assaulted with impunity in open day indicated\na condition of affairs in the United States not unlike that of France at\nthe time when Count Toliendal was judicially murdered by Louis XV.\nWashington City was an oligarchical despotism.",
        "A dark cloud hung over the Republic during the winter of 1860-’61. The\nimpending danger was that war would break out before Lincoln could be\ninaugurated. Such secrecy was observed by the Republican leaders that\neven Horace Greeley could not fathom their intentions. Late in December\nJohn A. Andrew and George L. Stearns went to Washington to survey the\nground for themselves, and the latter wrote to William Robinson, “The\nwatchword is, keep quiet.” He probably obtained this from Sumner,\nand it gives the key to the whole situation.",
        "It demolishes Von Hoist’s finely-spun melodramatic theory in regard to\nthat period of our history, in which he finally compares the condition of\nthe United States to a drowning man who sees lurid flames before his\neyes. In the Republican and Union parties there were all shades of\ncompromise sentiment,—from those who were ready to sacrifice anything in\norder to prevent secession, to Abraham Lincoln, who was only willing to\nsurrender the barren and unpopulated State of New Mexico to the\nslaveholders. [Footnote: A not unreasonable proposition.] But Sumner,\nWade, Trumbull, Wilson, and King stood together like a rocky coast\nagainst which the successive waves of compromise dashed without effect.\nVon Hoist was notified of this fact years before the last volume of his\nhistory was published, but he disregarded it evidently because it\ninterfered with his favorite theory.",
        "The last of January, however, a report was circulated in Boston that\nSumner had joined the compromisers for the sake of consistency with the\npeace principles which he had advocated in his Fourth of July oration.\nBoston newspapers made the most of this, although it did not seem likely\nto Sumner’s friends, and George L. Stearns finally wrote to him for\npermission to make a denial of it. Sumner first replied to him by\ntelegraph saying: “I am against sending commissioners to treat of\nsurrender by the North. Stand firm.” Then he wrote him this memorable\nletter.",
        "WASHINGTON, 3d Feb., ’61.",
        "My Dear Sir:",
        "There are but few who stand rooted, like the oak, against a storm. This\nis the nature of man. Let us be patient.",
        "My special trust is this: No possible compromise or concession will be\nof the least avail. Events are hastening which will supersede all\nsuch things. This will save us. But I like to see Mass. in this breaking\nup of the Union ever true. God keep her from playing the part of Judas\nor—of Peter! You may all bend or cry pardon—I will not. Here I am, and\nI mean to stand firm to the last. God bless you!",
        "Ever yours,",
        "CHARLES SUMNER.",
        "The handwriting of this letter is magnificent. Sumner had a strongly\ncharacteristic hand with something of artistic grace in it, too; but in\nthis instance his writing seems like the external expression of the mood\nhe was in when he wrote the letter.",
        "The question may be asked, Why then did not Sumner rise in the Senate and\nmake one of his telling speeches against compromise during that long,\nwearisome session? I think the answer will be found in the watchword:\n“Keep quiet!” He perfectly understood the game that Seward was playing\nand he was too wise to interfere with it. Seward was the cat and\ncompromise was the mouse. Whatever mistakes he may have afterwards made,\nSeward at this time showed a master hand. He encouraged compromise, but\nhe must have been aware that the proposed constitutional amendment, which\nwould forever have prevented legislation against slavery, would not have\nbeen confirmed by the Northern States. He could easily count the\nlegislatures that would reject it. It finally passed through Congress on\nthe last night of this session by a single vote, and was ratified by only\nthree States!",
        "As soon as Lincoln was inaugurated there was no more talk of compromise,\nand Seward was firmness itself. He declined to receive the disunion\ncommissioners; [Footnote: At the same time he coquetted with them\nunofficially.] he compelled the Secretary of War to reinforce Fort\nPickens; he overhauled General Scott, who proved an impediment to\nvigorous military operations. These facts tell their own tale.",
        "After Seward and Chase had left the Senate Sumner was facile\nprinceps. Trumbull was a vigorous orator and a rough-rider in debate,\nbut he did not possess the store of legal knowledge and the vast fund of\ngeneral information which Sumner could draw from. One has to read the\nfourth volume of Pierce’s biography to realize the dimensions of Sumner’s\nwork during the period from 1861 to 1869. Military affairs he never\ninterfered with, but he was Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs,\nthe most important in the Senate, and in the direction of home politics\nhe was second to none. No other voice was heard so often in the\nlegislative halls at Washington, and none heard with more respect. A list\nof the bills that he introduced and carried through would fill a long\ncolumn.",
        "The test of statesmanship is to change from the opposition to the\nleadership in a Government,—from critical to constructive politics. Carl\nSchurz was a fine orator and an effective speaker on the minority side,\nbut he commenced life as a revolutionist and always remained one. If he\nhad once attempted to introduce legislation, he would have shown his\nweakness, exactly where Sumner proved his strength. Froude says that to\nbe great in politics “is to recognize a popular movement, and to have the\ncourage and address to lead it\"; but three times Sumner planted his\nstandard away in advance of his party, and stood by it alone until his\nfollowers came up to him.",
        "He was always in advance of his party, but conspicuously so in regard to\nthe abolition of slavery, the exposure of Andrew Johnson’s perfidy, and\nthe reconstruction of the rebellious States. We might add the annexation\nof San Domingo as a fourth; for I believe there are few thinking persons\nat present who do not feel grateful to him for having saved the country\nfrom that uncomfortable acquisition.",
        "The bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia was introduced by\nWilson. Sumner did not like to be always proposing anti-slavery measures\nhimself, and he wished Wilson to have the honor of it. Wilson would not,\nof course, have introduced the measure without consulting his colleague.",
        "Lincoln evidently desired to enjoy the sole honor of issuing the\nEmancipation Proclamation of 1862, and he deserved to have it; but Sumner\nthought it might safely have been done after the battles of Fort\nDonaldson and Shiloh, and the victories of Foote and Farragut on the\nMississippi, six months before it was issued; and he urged to have it\ndone at that time. Whether his judgment was correct in this, it is\nimpossible to decide.",
        "Early in July, 1862, he introduced a bill in the Senate for the\norganization of the “contrabands” and other negroes into regiments,—a\npolicy suggested by Hamilton in 1780,—and no one can read President\nLincoln’s Message to Congress in December, 1864, without recognizing that\nit was only with the assistance of negro troops that the Union was\nfinally preserved.",
        "In spite of the continued differences between Sumner and Seward on\nAmerican questions they worked together like one man in regard to foreign\npolitics. Sumner’s experience in Europe and his knowledge of public men\nthere was much more extensive than Seward’s, and in this line he was of\ninvaluable assistance to the Secretary of State.",
        "Lowell could make a holiday of six years at the Court of St. James, but\nduring the war it was a serious matter to be Minister to England. In the\nsummer of 1863 affairs there had reached a climax. The Alabama and\nFlorida were scaring all American ships from the ocean, and five\nironclad rams, built for the confederate government, were nearly ready to\nput to sea from English ports. If this should happen it seemed likely\nthat they would succeed in raising the blockade. As a final resort\nLincoln and Seward sent word to Adams to threaten the British Government\nwith war unless the rams were detained.",
        "Meanwhile it was necessary to brace up the American people to meet the\npossible emergency. On September 10 Sumner addressed an audience of three\nthousand persons in Cooper Institute, New York, for three hours on the\nforeign relations of the United States; and there were few who left the\nhall before it was finished. He arraigned the British Government for its\ninconsistency, its violation of international law, and its disregard of\nthe rights of navigators. It was not only a heroic effort, but a self-\nsacrificing one; for Sumner knew that it would separate him forever from\nthe larger number of his English friends.",
        "At the same time Minister Adams had an equally difficult task before him.\nWar with England seemed to be imminent. He held a long consultation with\nBenjamin Moran, the Secretary of Legation, and they finally concluded to\nsee if an opinion could be obtained on the confederate rams from an\nEnglish legal authority. They went to Sir Robert Colyer, one of the lords\nof the admiralty, and asked him if he was willing to give them an\nopinion. He replied that he considered the law above politics, and that\nhe wished to do what was right. After investigating the subject Colyer\nmade a written statement to the effect that the United States was wholly\njustified in demanding detention of the rams. Adams then placed this\nopinion together with Lincoln’s notification before the British Cabinet,\nbut the papers were returned to him with a refusal of compliance. “There\nis nothing now,” said Adams to Moran, “but for us to pack up and go\nhome\"; but Moran replied, “Let us wait a little; while there is life\nthere is hope\"; and the same evening Adams was notified that Her\nMajesty’s Government still had the subject under consideration. The rams\nproved a dead loss.",
        "When Benjamin Moran related this incident to the Philadelphia Hock Club\nafter his return, he added: “We owe it to our Irish-American citizens as\nmuch as to the monitors that we did not suffer from English\ninterference.”",
        "Seward, and also Chase, wished to issue letters of reprisal to privateers\nto go in search of the Alabama, but Sumner opposed this in an able\nspeech on the importance of maintaining a high standard of procedure for\nthe good reputation of the country; and he carried his point.",
        "Sumner’s greatest parliamentary feat was occasioned by Trumbull’s\nintroduction of a bill for the reconstruction of Louisiana in the winter\nof 1864. There were only ten thousand loyal white voters in the State;\nand nothing could be more imprudent or prejudicial than such a hasty\nattempt at reorganization of the rebellious South, before the war was\nfairly ended. It was like a man building an annex to one side of his\nhouse while the other side was on fire; yet it was known to be supported\nby Seward, and, as was alleged, also by Lincoln. It was thrust upon\nCongress at the last moment, evidently in order to prevent an extended\ndebate, and Sumner turned this to his own advantage. For two days and\nnights his voice resounded through the Senate chamber, until, with the\nassistance of his faithful allies, Wade and Wilson, he succeeded in\npreventing the bill from being brought to a vote. It was an extreme\ninstance of human endurance, without parallel before or since, and may\npossibly have shortened Sumner’s life. Five weeks later President\nLincoln, in his last speech, made the significant proposition of\nuniversal amnesty combined with universal suffrage. Would that he could\nhave lived to see the completion of his work!",
        "Something may be said here of Sumner’s influence with Mrs. Lincoln. If\nDon Piatt is to be trusted, Mrs. Lincoln came to Washington with a\nstrong feeling of antipathy towards Seward and “those eastern\nabolitionists.” She was born in a slave state and had remained pro-\nslavery,—a fact which did not trouble her husband because he did not\nallow it to trouble him. Fifteen months in Washington brought a decided\nchange in her opinions, and Sumner would seem to have been instrumental\nin this conversion. It is well known that she preferred his society to\nthat of others. She had studied French somewhat, and he encouraged her to\ntalk it with him,—which was looked upon, of course, as an affectation on\nboth sides.",
        "At the time of General McClellan’s removal, October, 1862, Mrs. Lincoln\nwas at the Parker House in Boston. Sumner called on her in the forenoon,\nand she said at once: “I suppose you have heard the news, and that you\nare glad of it. So am I. Mr. Lincoln told me he expected to remove him\nbefore I left Washington.”",
        "Sumner resembled Charles XII. of Sweden in this: there is no evidence\nthat he ever was in love. His devotion to the law in early life,\nsurrounded as he was by interesting friends, may have been antagonistic\nto matrimony. The woman he ought to have married was the noble daughter\nof his old friend, Cornelius Felton, whom he often met, but whose worth\nhe never recognized. The marriage which he contracted late in life was\nnot based on enduring principles, and soon came to a grievous end. It was\nmore like the marriages that princes make than a true republican\ncourtship. Sumner apparently wanted a handsome wife to preside at his\ndinner parties in Washington, but he chose her from among his opponents\ninstead of from among his friends.",
        "Since there has been much foolish talk upon this subject, it may be well\nto state here that the true difficulty between Mr. and Mrs. Sumner was\nowing to the company which he invited to his house. She only wished to\nentertain fashionable people, but a large proportion of Sumner’s friends\ncould not be included within these narrow limits. As Senator from\nMassachusetts that would not do for him at all. This is the explanation\nthat was given by Mrs. Sumner’s brother, and it is without doubt the\ncorrect one; but women in such cases are apt to allege something\ndifferent from the true reason.",
        "Sumner’s most signal triumph happened on the occasion of President\nJohnson’s first Message to Congress in January, 1865. He rose from his\nseat and characterized it as a “whitewashing document.” That day he stood\nalone, yet within six weeks every Republican Senator was at his side.",
        "Sumner knew how to be silent as well as to talk. On one occasion he was\nmaking a speech in the Senate when he suddenly heard Schuyler Colfax\nbehind him saying, “This is all very good, Sumner, but here I have the\nAppropriation bills from the House, and the Democrats know nothing about\nthem.” Sumner instantly resumed his seat, and the bills were acted on\nwithout serious opposition. He would sometimes sit through a dinner at\nthe Bird Club without saying very much, but if he once started on a\nsubject that interested him there was no limit to it.",
        "Sumner’s speech on the “Alabama claims” was considered a failure because\nthe administration did not afterwards support him; and it is true that no\ngovernment would submit to a demand for adventitious damages so long as\nit could prevent this; but it was a far-reaching exposure of an\nunprincipled foreign policy, and this speech formed the groundwork for\nthe Treaty of Washington and the Geneva arbitration. It was a more\nimportant case than the settlement of the Northeastern boundary.",
        "Sumner died the death of a hero. The administration of General Grant\nmight well be called the recoil of the cannon: it was the reactionary\neffect of a great military movement on civil affairs. Sumner alone\nwithstood the shock of it, and he fought against it for four years like a\nveteran on his last line of defence, feeling victory was no longer\npossible. Many of his friends found the current too strong for them; his\nown party deserted him; even the Legislature of his own State turned\nagainst him in a senseless and irrational manner. Still his spirit was\nunconquerable, and he continued to face the storm as long as life was in\nhim. It was a magnificent spectacle.",
        "It was the last battlefield of a veteran warrior, and although Sumner\nretired from it with a mortal wound, he had the satisfaction of winning a\nglorious victory. No end could have been more appropriate to such a life.\nDulce et decorum est pro patria mori.",
        "Since Richard Coeur de Leon forgave Bertram de Gordon, who caused his\ndeath, there has never been a more magnanimous man than Charles Sumner.\nOnce when L. Maria Child was anathematizing Preston S. Brooks in his\npresence, he said: “You should not blame him. It was slavery and not\nBrooks that struck me. If Brooks had been born and brought up in New\nEngland, he would no more have done the thing he did than Caleb Cushing\nwould have done it,\"—Cushing always being his type of a pro-slavery\nYankee.",
        "In 1871 Charles W. Slack, the editor of the Boston Commonwealth,\nfor whom Sumner had obtained a lucrative office, turned against his\nbenefactor in order to save his position. When I spoke of this to Sumner,\nhe said: “Well, it is human nature. Slack is growing old, and if he keeps\nhis office for the next six years, he will have a competency. I have no\ndoubt he feels grateful to me, and regrets the course he is taking.” At\nthe same time, he spoke sadly.",
        "Sumner resembled Lord Chatham more closely than any statesman of the\nnineteenth century. He carried his measures through by pure force of\nargument and clearness of foresight. From 1854 to 1874 it was his policy\nthat prevailed in the councils of the nation. He succeeded where others\nfailed.",
        "He defeated Franklin Pierce, Seward, Trumbull, Andrew Johnson, Hamilton\nFish, and even Lincoln, on the extradition of Mason and Slidell. He tied\nJohnson down, so that he could only move his tongue.",
        "In considering Sumner’s oratory, we should bear in mind what Coleridge\nsaid to Allston, the painter,—\"never judge a work of art by its\ndefects.” His sentences have not the classic purity of Webster’s, and his\ndelivery lacked the ease and elegance of Phillips and Everett. His style\nwas often too florid and his Latin quotations, though excellent in\nthemselves, were not suited to the taste of his audiences. But Sumner was\nalways strong and effective, and that is, after all, the main point. Like\nWebster he possessed a logical mind, and the profound earnestness of his\nnature gave an equally profound conviction to his words. Besides this,\nSumner possessed the heroic element, as Patrick Henry and James Otis\npossessed it. After Webster’s death there was no American speaker who\ncould hold an audience like him.",
        "Matthew Arnold, in his better days, said that Burke’s oratory was too\nrich and overloaded. This is true, but it is equally true that Burke is\nthe only orator of the eighteenth century that still continues to be\nread. He had a faulty delivery and an ungainly figure, but if he emptied\nthe benches in the House of Commons he secured a larger audience in\ncoming generations. The material of his speeches is of such a vital\nquality that it possesses a value wholly apart from the time and occasion\nof its delivery.",
        "Much the same is true of Sumner, who would have had decidedly the\nadvantage of Burke so far as personal impressiveness is concerned. His\nPhi Beta Kappa address of 1845 is so rich in material that it is even\nmore interesting to read now than when it was first delivered, and his\nremarks on Allston in that oration might be considered to advantage by\nevery art critic in the country. It should always be remembered that a\nspeech, like a play, is written not to be read, but to be acted; and\nthose discourses which read so finely in the newspapers are not commonly\nthe ones that sounded the best when they were delivered.",
        "Great men create great antagonisms. The antagonism which Lincoln excited\nwas concentrated in Booth’s pistol shot, and the Montagues and Capulets\nbecame reconciled over his bier; but the antagonism against Sumner still\ncontinues to smoke and smoulder like the embers of a dying conflagration.",
