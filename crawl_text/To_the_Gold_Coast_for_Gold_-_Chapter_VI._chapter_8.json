        "THE ROUTINE ASCENT OF MOUNT ATLAS, THE ’PIKE’ OF TENERIFE.",
        "The trip was so far routine that we followed in the steps of all\nprevious travellers, and so far not routine that we made it in March,\nwhen, according to all, the Mal Pais is impassable, and when furious\nwinds threaten to sweep away intruders like dry leaves.",
        "[Footnote: The usual months are July and August. Captain Baudin, not\nfavourably mentioned by Humboldt, ascended in December 1797 with M. Le\nGros and the naturalists Advenier, Mauger, and Riedlé. He rolled down\nfrom half-way on the cone to the bottom of La Rambleta, and was stopped\nonly by a snow-covered lava-heap. Mr. Addison chose February, when he\n’suffered more from enormous radiation than from cold.’ He justifies his\nchoice (p. 22) by observing that ’the seasons above are much earlier\nthan they are below, consequently the latter part of the spring is the\nbest season to visit the Peak.’ In October, at an elevation of 10,700\nfeet, he found the cold greater than it was in February. In July 1863 I\nrode round the island, to the Cumbre pumice-plains, and by no means\nenjoyed the southern ride. A place near Guimar showed me thirty-six\nbarrancos (deep ravines) to be crossed within three leagues.]",
        "The good folk of the Villa, indeed, declared that the Ingleza could\nnever reach even the Estancia de los Inglezes.",
        "Our train was modest–a pair of nags with their attendants, and two\nexcellent sumpter-mules carrying provisions and blankets. The guide was\nManoel Reyes, who has already appeared in the ’Specialities of a\nResidence Above the Clouds.’ He is a small, wizen-faced man, quiet,\nself-contained, and fond–exceedingly fond–of having his own way. By\ndint of hard work we left the Fonda Gobea at 9 A.M. on March 23, with\nloud cries of ’Mulo!’ and ’Anda, caballo!’ and ’So-o-o!’ when the\nbât-beasts indulged in a free fight.",
        "Morning smiled upon our incept. Nothing could be lovelier than the\nweather as we crossed the deluging Martinianez Fiumara; struck the\ncoast-road westward, and then, bending to the south-west, made for the\n’Gate of Taoro,’ a gap in the Cañáda-wall. From the higher level truly\ncharming was the aspect of Orotava: it was Funchal many times\nimproved. Beyond the terraced foreground of rich deep yellow clay,\ngrowing potatoes, wheat, and the favourite chochos (lupines),\nwith apple and chestnut trees, the latter of two kinds, and the lower\nfields marked out by huge agaves, lay the Happy Valley. Its contrast of\nvivid greens, of white quintas, of the two extinct volcanos\noverlooking Orotava, and of the picturesque townlets facing the misty\nblue sea, fringed with a ceaseless silvery surf by the brisa, or\nnorth-east trade, the lord of these latitudes, had not a symptom of the\nMadeiran monotony of verdure. Behind us towered high the snowy Pilon\n(Sugar-loaf), whose every wave and fold were picked out by golden\nsunlight, azure half-light, and purple shade.",
        "As we advanced up the Camiño de Chasna, a road only by name, the\nquintas were succeeded by brown-thatched huts, single or in\nclumps. On the left, 3,400 feet above sea-level, stood the Pino del\nDornajito (’of the Little Trough’), one of the few survivors in this\nonce wealthy pine-ground. The magnificent old tree, which was full grown\nin the days of the conquest, and which in the seventeenth century was a\nfavourite halting-point, suffered severely from the waterspout of\nNovember 7, 1826; but still measured 130 feet long by 29 in girth. The\nvegetation now changed. We began brushing through the arbutus\n(callicarpa), the wild olive (Olea excelsa), the Canarian\noak, the daphne, the myrtle entwined with indigenous ivy (Hedera\ncanariensis); the cytisus, the bright green hypericum of three\nspecies, thyme, gallworts, and arborescent and other ferns in numbers,\nespecially the hare’s-foot and the peculiar Asplenium canariense,\nthe Trichomanes canariensis, and the Davallia canariensis;\nthe brezo (Erica aborea and E. scoparia), a heath\nwhose small white bells scented the air; and the luxuriant blackberry,\nused to fortify the drystone walls. The dew-cloud now began to float\nupwards from the sea in scarf-shape, only a few hundred feet thick; it\nhad hangings and fringes where it was caught by the rugged hill-flanks;\nand above us globular masses, white as cotton bales, rolled over one\nanother. As in the drier regions of Africa the hardly risen sun made\nitself felt.",
        "At 10.20 A.M. we had passed out of the cultivated region to the Montijo,\nor Monte Verde, the laurel-region. The ’wood’ is the remains of a fine\nforest accidentally fired by charcoal-burners; it is now a copse of\narborescent heath-worts, ilex (I. Perado), and Faya\n(Myrica Faya), called the ’Portugal laurel,’ some growing ten\nfeet high. We then entered upon rough ground, El Juradillo (’the\nHollow’); this small edition of the Mal Pais, leading to the Canadas, is\na mass of lava-beds and dry barrancos (ravines) grooved and\nsheeted by rushing torrents. The latter show the anatomy of the\nland–tufas, lavas, conglomerates, trachytes, trachydolerites, and\nbasalts of various kinds. Most of the rocks are highly magnetic, and are\nseparated by thin layers of humus with carbonised plant-roots. Around\nEl Juradillo rises a scatter of montanetas, shaped like\nhalf-buried eggs: originally parasitic cones, they evidently connect\nwith the main vent. About 1 P.M., after four hours’ ride, we dismounted\nat the Estancia de la Sierra (6,500 feet); it is a pumice-floor a few\nfeet broad, dotted with bush and almost surrounded by rocks that keep\noff a wind now blowing cold and keen. Consequently, as broken pots and\nbottles show, it is a favourite resting-place.",
        "After halting an hour we rode up a slope whose obtuser talus showed that\nwe were reaching the far-famed platform, called Las Cañádas del\nPico. The word, here meaning level ground, not, as usual, a canefield,\napplies especially to the narrow outer rim of the hollow plain; a\nbristling fortification of bluffs, pointing inwards, and often tilted to\nquoins 300 feet high, with an extreme of 1,000. Trachyte and basalt,\nwith dykes like Cyclopean walls, are cut to jagged needles by the\nfurious north-easter. Around the foot, where it is not encumbered with\ndébris like the base of an iceberg, a broad line of comminuted\npumice produces vegetation like a wady-growth in Somali Land. The\ncentral bed allows no short cut across: it is a series of rubbish-heaps,\nparasitic cones, walls, and lumps of red-black lavas, trachytes, and\nphonolites reposing upon a deluge of frozen volcanic froth ejected by\nearly eruptions. The aspect was rejoicing as the Arabian desert: I would\nwillingly have spent six months in the purest of pure air.",
        "These flats of pumice, ’stones of emptiness,’ loose incoherent matter,\nare the site of the first great crater. Tenerife is the type of a\nthree-storied volcano, as Stromboli is of one and Vesuvius of two\nstages. The enormous diameter of this ancient feature is eight by seven\nmiles, with a circumference of twenty-three–greater even than\nHawaii–and here one feels that our earth was once a far sublimer\nscene. Such forms belong to the earlier volcanic world, and astronomers\nstill suspect them in the moon. [Footnote: Las Cañádas was shown to be a\nvolcanic crater in 1803 by Professor Cordier, the first scientific\nvisitor in modern days (Lettre à Devilliers fils), and in 1810 by\nD. Francisco Escobar (Estadistica). They make the old vent ten\nleagues round.] The altitude is 6,900 feet, nearly double the height of\nVesuvius (3,890 feet); and the lines sweep upwards towards the Pilon,\nwhere they reach 8,950 feet.",
        "The tints of Las Cañádas, seen from above, are the tenderest yellow and\na brownish red, like the lightest coat of vegetation turning ruddy in\nthe sun. Where level, Las Cañádas is a floor of rapilli and\npumice-fragments, none larger than a walnut, but growing bigger as they\napproach the Pike. The colours are dun (barriga de monja),\ngolden-yellow, and brown burnt red like autumnal leaves. There is\nmarvellous colouring upon the bluffs and ridges of the rim–lamp-black\nand brown-black, purple (light and dark), vermilion-red, and sombre hues\nsuperficially stained ruddy by air-oxygen. The picture is made brighter\nby the leek-green vegetation and by the overarching vault of glaring\nblue. Nor are the forms less note-worthy. Long centuries of weathering\nhave worked the material into strange shapes–here a ruined wall, there\nan old man with a Jesuit’s cap; now a bear, then a giant python. It is\nthe oldest lava we have yet seen, except the bed of the Orotava\nvalley. The submarine origin is denoted by fossils found in the flank;\nthey are of Miocene age, like those common in Madeira, and they were\nknown as early as the days of Clavijo (1772).",
        "Las Canadas is not wholly a ’dead creation;’ the birds were more\nnumerous than on the plains. A powerful raptor, apparently an eagle with\nblack-barred wings, hung high in air amongst the swallows winging their\nway northwards, and the Madeiran sparrow-hawk was never out of sight;\nravens, unscared by stone-throwing boys, flew over us unconcernedly,\nwhile the bushes sheltered many blackbirds, the Canary-bird\n(Fringilla canaria) showed its green belly and grey back and\nwings, singing a note unknown to us; and an indigenous linnet\n(F. teydensis), small and green-robed, hopped over the ground\ntame as a wren. We saw nothing of the red-legged partridge or the\nTetraonidae, reported to be common.",
        "The scattered growths were composed of the broomy Codeso and\nRetama. The former (Adenocarpus frankenoides), a leguminous\nplant, showed only dense light-green leaves without flower,\nand consequently without their heavy, cloying perfume. The woody stem\nacts in these regions as the doornboom of South Africa, the wild\nsage of the western prairies, and the shih (absinthium) of\nthe Arabian desert. The Arabic Retama, or Alpine broom\n(Cytisus fragrans, Lam.; Cyt. nubigenus, Decan.; Spartium\nnubigenum, Alton and Von Buch), is said to be peculiar\nto Tenerife, where it is not found under one vertical mile of\nheight. Some travellers divide it into two species, Spartium\nmonospermum and S. nubigenum. The bush, 9 to 10 feet tall by 7 to\n15 inches diameter, is easily distinguished from the Codeso by\nits denser and deeper green. This pretty rounded growth, with its short\nbrown stem throwing out lateral branches which trail on the ground,\nflavours meat, and might be naturalised in Europe. From June till August\nit is covered with a profusion of white blossoms, making Las Canadas a\nHymettus, an apiarian heaven. It extends as far as the second cone, but\nthere it shrinks to a foot in height. We did not see the tree growing,\nbut we met a party of Chasna men, [Footnote: A romantic tale is told of\nthe origin of Chasna. In 1496, before the wars ended, one Pedro de\nBracamonte, a captain under De Lugo, captured a ’belle sauvage,’ who\nmade her escape after a few days. He went about continually repeating,\n’Vi la flor del valle’ (I saw the valley flower), and died after three\nmonths. His soldiers buried him and priests said masses for the soul of\nthis ’hot amorist.’] driving asses like onagers, laden with the gummy\nwood of the Tea or Tiya pine (P. canariensis). The\nvaluable material, which resists damp and decay for centuries, and which\nDecandolle declares would grow in Scotland, is rapidly disappearing from\nthe Pinals. The travellers carried cochineal-seed, for which their\nvillage is famous, and a hive which might have been Abyssinian. It was a\nhollow cylinder of palm-bole, closed with board at either end; in July\nand August it is carried up the mountain, where the bees cannot destroy\nthe grapes. We searched in vain for M. Broussonet’s white violet\n(V. teydensis), [Footnote: Humboldt’s five zones of vegetation on\nthe Pike are vines, laurels, pines, broom, and grasses (p. 116).\nMr. Addison modifies this scale to vines, laurels, pines and\njunipers, mountain-brooms and pumice-plains, I should distribute the\nheights as growing cochineal, potatoes, and cereals, chestnuts, pines,\nheaths, grasses, and bare rock.] and for the lilac-coloured Viola\ncheiranthifolia, akin to V. decumbens.",
        "The average annual temperature of Las Canadas is that of N. latitude 53\ndegrees, Holland and Hanover; in fact, here it is the Pyrenees, and\nbelow it Africa. The sun blazed from a desert of blue, and the waving\nheat-reek rose trembling and quivering from the tawny sides of the\nforegrounds. The clouds, whose volumes were disposed like the leaves of\na camellia, lay far down to the north-east, as if unable to face the\nfires of day. And now the great trachytic dome, towering in the\ntranslucent air, was the marking feature. Its angle, 35 to 42 degrees,\nor double that of the lower levels, suggests distant doubts as to its\npracticability, nor could we believe that it rises 3,243 feet above its\nwestern base, Las Cañádas. The summit, not including the terminal\nPilon–a comparatively dwarf cone [Footnote: There is a very bad sketch\nof the Pike in Mr. Scrope’s popular work on Volcanoes (p. 5); the\neruptive chimney is far too regularly conical.]–is ribboned with\nclinker, and streaked at this season with snow-lines radiating, like\nwheel-spokes from a common centre. Here and there hang, at an impossible\nangle, black lava-streams which were powerless to reach the plain: they\nresembled nothing so much as the gutterings of a candle hardening on the\noutside of its upright shaft. Evidently they had flowed down the slope\nin a half fluid state, and had been broken by contraction when\ncooling. In places, too, the surface was streaked with light yellow\npatches, probably of sun-gilt tosa or pumice.",
        "On our right, or to the north-north-east of the Pike, rose La Fortaleza,\nalias the Golliada del Cedro. The abrupt wall had salient and\nre-entering angles, not unlike the Palisades of the Hudson River, with\nintercalated strata and a smooth glacis at the base, except between the\neast and north-west, where the periphery has been destroyed. It is\napparently basalt, as we may expect in the lower levels before reaching\nthe trachytic region. The other notable features were Monte Tigayga,\nwith its vertical cliff, trending northwards to the sea; the gap through\nwhich the Orotava lava-bed burst the crater-margin; the Llano de Maja\n(’Manja’ in Berthelot), a strip of Las Canadas, and the horizontally\nstriated Peak of Guajara (8,903 feet).",
        "Riding over the ’pumice-beach of a once fiery sea,’ whose glare and\nother accidents suggested the desert between Cairo and Suez, we made our\nway towards the Rastrojito. This ’Little Stubble’ is a rounded heap of\npumice, a southern offset of the main mountain. On the left rose the\nMontana Negra (Black Mountain) and the Lomo de la Nieve (’Snow Ridge),’\na dark mass of ribbed and broken lavas (8,970 feet), in which\nsummer-snow is stored. A little black kid, half wild, was skipping over\nthe rocks. Our men pursued it with the garrotes (alpenstocks),\nloudly shouting,’ Tio Jose!’: ’Uncle Joseph,’ however, escaped, running\nlike a Guanche. Here it is allowed to shoot the animals on condition of\nleaving a shilling with the skin. The latter is used in preparing the\nnational gofio, the Guanche ahoren, the kuskusu of\nnorth-western Africa, the polenta, or daily bread, of the\nNeo-Latins.",
        "Climbing the Rastrojito slopes, we sighted the Pedras Negras: these are\nhuge travelled rocks of basalt, jet-black, breaking with a conchoidal\nfracture, and showing debris like onion-coats about their base. The\naspect was fantastic, resembling nothing so much as skulls 10 to 15 feet\nhigh. They are doubtless the produce of the upper slopes, which by slow\ndegrees gravitated to the present pumice-beds.",
        "The first step of the Pike is Las Canadas, whose glacis forms the\nCumbre, or pumice-plains (6,500 feet), the long dorsum, which\nshows far out at sea. Bending abruptly to the east, we began to breast\nthe red pumice-bed leading to the Estancia de Abajo or de los\nInglezes. ’El es Inglez porque subio al Pico’ (’he is English, because\nhe climbed the Pike’), say the people. This ramp, whose extreme angle is\n26 degrees, bordered by thick bands of detached lava-rocks, is doubtless\nthe foundation-matter of the Pike. Hence the latter is picturesquely\ntermed ’Hijo de las Canadas.’ [Footnote: Especially by D. Benigno\nCarballo Wanguement in his work, Las Afortunadas (Madrid, 1862),\na happy title borrowed from D. Francisco Escobar. Heyley\n(Cosmography), quoted by Glas and Mrs. Murray, tells us of an\nEnglish ambassador who, deeming his own land the ’Fortunate Islands,’\nprotested against Pope Clement VI. so entitling the Canaries in a deed\nof gift to D. Luis de la Cerda, the ’Disinherited’ Conde de\nClaramonte. The latter was deprived of the Crown of Castile by his\nuncle, Sancho IV., and became the founder of the Medina Celi house.]",
        "After a total climb and ride of six hours, we reached the ’English\nstation.’ M. Eden (Aug. 13, 1715) [Footnote: Trans. Royal Soc. of\nLondon, 1714-16.] calls it simply Stancha, and M. Borda ’Station des\nRochers.’ Pere Feutree, a Frenchman who ascended in 1524, and wrote the\nearliest scientific account, had baptised it Station de St. Francois de\nPaul, and set up a cross. It is a shelf in the pumice-slope, 9,930 feet\nhigh, and protected against the cold night-winds of the\nnorth-north-east, the lower or polar current, by huge boulders of\nobsidian, like gigantic sodawater-bottles. The routine traveller sleeps\nupon this level a few hundred yards square, because the guides store\ntheir fuel in an adjacent bed of black rocks. Humboldt miscalls the\nstation ’a kind of cavern;’ and a little above it he nearly fell on the\nslippery surface of the ’compact short-swarded turf’ which he had left\n4,000 feet below him.",
        "The bât-mules were unpacked and fed; and a rough bed was made up under\nthe lea of the tallest rock, where a small curral of dry stone\nkept off the snow. This, as we noticed in Madeira, is not in flakes, nor\nin hail-like globes: it consists of angular frozen lumps, and the\nselvage becomes the hardest ice. Some have compared it with the Swiss\n’firn,’ snow stripped of fine crystals and granulated by time and\nexposure. In March the greatest depth we saw in the gullies radiating\nfrom the mountain-top was about three feet. But in the cold season all\nmust be white as a bride-cake; and fatal accidents occur in the Canada\ndrifts. Professor Piazzi Smyth characterises the elevated region as cold\nenough at night, and stormy beyond measure in winter, when the\nsouth-wester, or equatorial upper current, produces a fearful\nclimate. Yet the Pike summit lies some 300 feet below the snow-line\n(12,500 feet).",
        "The view was remarkable: we were in sight of eighty craters. At sunset\nthe haze cleared away from the horizon, which showed a straight\ngrey-blue line against a blushing sky of orange, carmine, pale pink, and\ntender lilac, passing through faint green into the deep dark blue of the\nzenith. In this cumbre, or upper region, the stars did not\nsurprise us by their brightness. At 6 P.M. the thermometer showed 32\ndegrees F.; the air was delightfully still and pure, [Footnote: We had\nno opportunity of noticing what Mr. Addison remarks, the air becoming\nsonorous and the sound of the sea changing from grave to acute after\nsunset and during the night. He attributes this increased intensity to\nadditional moisture and an equability of temperature in the atmospheric\nstrata. Perhaps the silence of night may tend to exaggerate the\nimpression.] and Death mummifies, but does not decay.",
        "A bright fire secured us against the piercing dry night-cold; and the\narrieros began to sing like capirotes [Footnote: The\nCapirote or Tinto Negro, a grey bird with black head\n(Sylvia atricapilla), is also found in Madeira, and much\nresembles the Eastern bulbul or Persian nightingale. It must be caged\nwhen young, otherwise it refuses to sing, and fed upon potatos and bread\nwith milk, not grain. An enthusiast, following Humboldt (p. 87),\ndescribes the ’joyous and melodious notes’ of the bird as ’the purest\nincense that can ascend to heaven.’] (bulbuls), sundry seguidillas,\nand El Tajaraste. The music may be heard everywhere between Morocco\nand Sind. It starts with the highest possible falsetto and gradually\nfalls like a wail, all in the minor clef.",
        "We rose next morning with nipped feet and hands, which a cup of hot\ncoffee, ’with,’ speedily corrected, and were en route at 4.30\nA.M. Formerly animals were left at the lower estancia; now they\nare readily taken on to Alta Vista. My wife rode a sure-footed black\nnag, I a mule which was perfect whilst the foot-long lever acting curb\nlay loose on its neck. Returning, we were amazed at the places they had\npassed during the moonless night.",
        "Our path skirted the Estancia de los Alemanos, about 300 yards higher\nthan the English, and zig-zagged sharply up the pumice-slope. The talus\nnow narrowed; the side-walls of dark trachytic blocks pinching it in. At\nthis grisly hour they showed the quaintest figures–towers and\npinnacles, needles and tree-trunks, veiled nuns and monstrous\nbeasts. Amongst them were huge bombs of obsidian, and masses with\ntranslucent, vitreous edges that cut like glass. Most of them contained\ncrystals of felspar and pyroxene.",
        "After half an hour we reached the dwarf platform of Alta Vista, 700 feet\nabove the Estancia and 10,730, in round numbers, above sea-level. The\nlittle shelf, measuring about 100 to 300 yards, at the head of the fork\nwhere the north-eastern and the south-western lava-streams part, is\ndivided by a medial ledge. Here we saw the parent rock of the pumice\nfragments, an outcrop of yellowish brown stone, like fractured and\nhardened clay. The four-footed animals were sent back: one rides up but\nnot down such places.",
        "Passing in the lower section the shell of a house where the Astronomer’s",
        "[Footnote: The author came out in 1856 to make experiments in\nastronomical observations. Scientific men have usually a contempt for\nlanguage: we find the same in Our Inheritanse, &c. (Dalby & Co.,\nLondon, 1877), where the poor modern hierogrammats are not highly\nappreciated. But it is a serious blemish to find ’Montana Blanco,’\n’Malpays,’ ’Chahzorra’ (for Chajorra), and ’Tiro del Guanches.’ The\nauthor also is wholly in error about Guanche mummification. He derides\n(p. 329) the shivering and shaking of his Canarian guide under a cloudy\nsky of 40°F., when the sailor enjoyed it in their ’glorious strength of\nSaxon (?) constitution.’ But when the latter were oppressed and\ndiscouraged by dry heat and vivid radiation, Manoel was active as a\nchamois. Why should enduring cold and not heat be held as a test of\nmanliness?]",
        "experiment had been tried, Guide Manoel pointed out the place where\nstood the tormentos, as he called the instruments. Thence we\ntoiled afoot up the Mal Pais. This ’bad country’ is contradictorily\ndescribed by travellers. Glas (A.D. 1761) makes it a sheet of rock\ncracked cross-wise into cubes. Humboldt (1799) says, ’The lava, broken\ninto sharp pieces, leaves hollows in which we risked falling up to our\nwaists.’ Von Buch (1815) mentions ’the sharp edges of glassy obsidian,\nas dangerous as the blades of knives.’ Wilde (1857) tamely paints the\nscene as a ’magnified rough-cast.’ Prof. Piazzi Smyth is, as usual,\nexact, but he suggests more difficulty than the traveller finds. I saw\nnothing beyond a succession of ridge-backs and shrinkage-crevasses,\ndisposed upon an acute angle. These ragged, angular, and mostly cuboidal\nblocks, resembling the ice-pack of St. Lawrence River, have apparently\nbeen borne down by subsequent lava-currents, which, however, lacked\nimpetus to reach the lower levels of Las Cañádas.",
        "Springing from boulder to boulder, an exhilarating exercise for a time,\nover a ’surface of horrible roughness,’ as Prof. Dana says of Hawaii, we\nhalted to examine the Cueva de Hielo, whose cross has long succumbed to\nthe wintry winds. The ’ice-house’ in a region of fire occupies a little\nplatform like the ruined base of a Pompey’s Pillar. This is the table\nupon which the neveros pack their stores of snow. The cave, a\nmere hole in the trachytic lava, opens to the east with an entrance some\nfour feet wide. The general appearance was that of a large bubble in a\nbaked loaf. Inside we saw a low ceiling spiky with stalactites, possibly\nicicles, and a coating of greenish ice upon the floor. A gutter leads\nfrom the mouth, showing signs of water-wear, and the blocks of trachyte\nare so loaded with glossy white felspar that I attempted to dust them\nbefore sitting down.",
        "Local tradition connects this ice-cave with the famous burial-cavern\nnear Ycod, on the northern coast; this would give a tunnel 8 miles long\nand 11,040 feet high. Many declare that the meltings ebb and flow with\nthe sea-tide, and others recount that lead and lines of many fathoms\nfailed to touch bottom. We are told about the normal dog which fell in\nand found its way to the shore through the cave of Ycod de los Vinos. In\nthe latter a M. Auber spent four hours without making much way; in parts\nhe came upon scatters of Guanche bones. Mr. Robert Edwards, of Santa\nCruz, recounted another native tradition–that before the eruption of\nA.D. 1705 there was a run of water but no cave. Mr. Addison was let down\ninto it, and found three branches or lanes, the longest measuring 60-70\nfeet. What the neveros call el hombre de nieve (the\nsnow-man) proved to be a honeycombed mass of lava revetted with\nice-drippings. He judged the cave to be a crater of emission; and did\nnot see the smoke or steam issuing from it as reported by the\nice-collectors.",
        "Professor P. Smyth goes, I think, a little too far in making this\ncontemptible feature compose such a quarrel as that between the English\neruptionist and the Continental upheavalist. Deciding a disputed point,\nthat elevation is a force and a method in nature, he explains the cave\nby the explosion of gases, which blew off the surface of the dome, ’when\nthe heavy sections of the lava-roof, unsupported from below, fell\ndownward again, wedging into and against each other, so as nearly to\nreform their previous figure.’ But the unshattered state of the stones\nand the rounded surfaces of the sides show no sign of explosion. The\nupper Piton is unfitted for retaining water, which must percolate\nthrough its cinders, pumices, and loose matter into many a reservoir\nformed by blowing-holes. Snow must also be drifted in and retain, the\ncold. Moisture would be kept in the cavern by the low conducting power\nof its walls; so Lyell found, on Etna, a bed of solid ice under a\nlava-current. Possibly also this cave has a frozen substratum, like many\nof the ice-pools in North America.",
        "We then toiled up to another little estancia, a sheltered,\nrock-girt hollow. The floor of snow, or rather frozen rain, was\nsprinkled with red dust, and fronts the wind, with sharp icy points\nrising at an angle of 45°. Here, despite the penetrating cold, we\ngravely seated ourselves to enjoy at ease the hardly won pleasures of\nthe sunrise. The pallid white gleam of dawn had grown redder, brighter\nand richer. An orange flush, the first breaking of the beams faintly\nreflected from above, made the sky, before a deep and velvety\nblack-blue, look like a gilt canopy based upon a rim of azure mist. The\nbrilliancy waxed golden and more golden still; the blending of the\ncolours became indescribably beautiful; and, lastly, the sun’s upper\nlimb rose in brightest saffron above the dimmed and spurious horizon of\nnorth-east cloud. The panorama below us emerged dimly and darkly from a\ntorrent of haze, whose waving convex lines, moving with a majestic calm,\nwore the aspect of a deluge whelming the visible world. Martin the Great\nmight have borrowed an idea from this waste of waters, as it seemed to\nbe, heaving and breaking, surging and sweeping over the highest\nmountain-tops. We saw nothing of the immense triangular gnomon projected\nby the Pilon as far as Gomera Island, [Footnote: At sunset of July 10,\n1863, I could trace it extending to Grand Canary, darkening the southern\nhalf and leaving the northern in bright sunshine: the right limb was\nbetter defined than the left.]  and gradually contracting as the lamp of\nday rises. Item, we saw nothing of the archipelago like a map in relief;\nthe latter, however, is rarely visible in its entirety. Disappointment!",
        "During the descent we had a fair prospect of the Canarian\nTriquetra. Somewhat like Madeira, it has a longitudinal spine of\nmountains, generically called Las Cañádas; but, whilst the volcanic\nridge of the Isle of Wood runs in a latitudinal line, the Junonian\nCordillera has a whorl, the ancient as well as the modern seat of\neruption. Around the island appeared to be a rim, as if the sea-horizon\nformed a raised saucer–a common optical delusion at these altitudes.",
        "As we advanced the Mal Pais became more broken: the ’bad step’ was ugly\nclimbing, and we often envied our men, who wore heelless shoes of soft\nuntanned leather with soles almost as broad as they were long. The\nroughness of the trachytic blocks, however, rendered a slip\nimpossible. At 6.45 we reached the second floor of this three-storied\nvolcano, here 11,721 feet high. The guides call it the Pico del\nPilon, because it is the ancient Peak-Crater, and strangers the\nRambleta (not Rembleta) Volcano, which strewed Las Cañádas with fiery\npumice, and which shot up the terminal head ’conical as a cylinder.’  It\nhas now become an irregular and slightly convex plain a mile in\ndiameter, whose centre is the terminal chimney. Its main peculiarity is\nin the fumaroles, or escapes of steam, and mofetti, mephitic\nemanations of limpid water and sulphur-vapour. Of these we counted five\nnarices within as many hundred yards. Their temperature greatly varies,\n109° and 158° Fahr. being, perhaps, the extremes; my thermometer showed\n130°. These soupiraux or respiradouros are easily explained.\nThe percolations from above are heated to steam by stones\nrich in ’grough brimstone.’ Here it was that Humboldt saw apparent\nlateral shiftings and perpendicular oscillations of fixed stars; and our\nAdmiralty, not wishing to be behind him, directed Professor P. Smyth’s\nattention to ’scintillations in general.’ Only the youngest of\ntravellers would use such a place as an observatory; and only the\nyoungest of observers would have considered this libration of the\nstars an extraordinary phenomenon.",
        "Directed by a regular line of steam-puffs, we attacked El Pilon,\nthe third story, the most modern cone of eruption, the dwarf chimney\nwhich looks like a thimble from the sea. The lower third was of loose\ncrumbling pumice, more finely comminuted than we had yet seen; this is\nwhat Humboldt calls ’ash-cones.’ There was also a strew of porphyritic\nlava-chips covered with a red (ochreous?)  crust. Presently we reached a\nradiating rib of lately ejected lava, possibly the ridge of a dyke,\nbrown below and gradually whitening with sulphuric acid as it rose\ntowards the crater-walls. The resting took longer than the walking up\nthe steep talus; and at 7.45: after a total of nine hours and a\nmorning’s work of two hours and a half, which occupied two in\ndescending, we stood upon the corona or lip of ’Teyde.’",
        "The height of the Tenerife Pike, once held the loftiest in the world, is\n12,198 feet, in round numbers 12,200. Thus it stands nearly at the\naltitude of Mont Blanc (15,784 feet) above the Chamounix valley, a\nfigure of 12,284 feet. The slope from the base is 1 in 4.6. The direct\ndistance from Orotava on the map measures 10.5 miles; along the road 18,\naccording to the guides. The terminal chimney and outlet for vapours\nwhich would erupt elsewhere, rises 520 feet from its pedestal, the\ncentral Rambleta, and its ascent generally occupies an hour. One visitor\nhas reduced this montagne pelée to 60-70 feet, and compares it\nwith the dome of a glass-house. From below it resembles nothing so much\nas a cone of dirty brown cassonade, and travellers are justified\nin calling it a sugarloaf. I can hardly rest satisfied with Von Buch’s\ndescription. ’Teyde is a pointed tower surrounded by a ditch and a\ncircular chain of bastions.’",
        "The word Teyde is supposed to be a corruption of Echeyde, meaning Hades:\nhence the title Isla Infierno, found in a map of A.D. 1367. The Guanches\nalso called it Ayadyrma, and here placed their pandemonium, under\nGuayota, the head-fiend. The country-folk still term the crater-ring ’la\ncaldera de los diablos en que se cuecen todas las provisiones del\nInfierno’ (the Devil’s caldron, wherein are cooked all the rations of\nthe infernals). Seen by moonlight, or on a star-lit night, the scenery\nwould be weird and ghostly enough to suggest such fancies, which remind\nus of Etna and Lipari.",
        "I had been prepared by descriptions for a huge chasm-like crater or\ncraters like those on Theon Ochéma, Camerones Peak. I found a\nspoon-shaped hollow, with a gradual slope to the centre, 100 × 150 feet\ndeep, the greater length of the oval running north-east, where the side\nis higher, to south-west, where there is also a tilt of the cup. The\nfloor was a surface of burning marl and whitish earthy dough-like paste,\nthe effect of sulphurous acid vapours upon the argile of the lava. This\nstratum was in places more than 80 feet thick; and fumes rose fetid with\nsulphuric acid, and sulphates of soda, alumina, and ammonia from the\ndead white, purple red, vivid green, and brilliant yellow surface of the\nsolfatara. Hence the puffs of vapour seen from below against the\nsparkling blue sky, and disappearing like huge birds upon the wings of\nthe wind: hence, too, the tradition of the mast and the lateen sail. A\ndig with the Guanche magada or lanza, the island alpen-stock,\neither outside or inside the crater, will turn up, under the\nmoist white clay, lovely trimetric crystals of sulphur, with the\npalest straw tint, deepening to orange, and beautifully disposed in\nacicular shapes. The acid eats paper, and the colours fade before they\nleave the cone.",
        "[Footnote: Dr. Wilde (1837) analysed the sulphur as follows: Silica,\n81·13; water, 8·87; and a trace of lime. Others have obtained from the\nmineral, when condensed upon a cold surface, minute crystals of\nalum. Mr. Addison found in the ’splendid crystals of octahedral sulphur’\na glistening white substance of crystalline structure, yet somewhat like\nopal. When analysed it proved to contain 91 per cent. silex and the rest\nwater.]",
        "When sitting down it is advisable to choose a block upon which dew-drops\npearl. A few minutes of rest upon a certain block of marl, whose genial\nwarmth is most grateful, squatting in the sharp cold air, neatly removes\nall cloth in contact with the surface. More than one excursionist has\nshown himself in that Humphrey Clinker condition which excited the wrath\nof Count Tabitha. It is evident that Teyde is by no means exhausted, and\npossibly it may return to the state of persistent eruption described by\nthe eye-witness Ca da Mosto, who landed on the Canaries in A.D. 1505.",
        "Not at all impressed with the grandeur of the Inferno, we walked round\nthe narrow rim of the crater-cirque, and were shown a small breach in\nthe wall of porphyritic lava facing west. Mrs. Murray’s authorities\ndescribe the Caldera as being ’without any opening:’ if this be\nthe case the gap has lately formed. The cold had driven away the lively\nlittle colony of bees, birds, and butterflies which have been seen\ndisporting themselves about the bright white cauldron. There was not a\nbreath of the threatened wind. Manoel pointed out Mount Bermeja as the\nsource of the lateral lava-stream whose ’infernal avalanche,’ on May 5,\n1706, [Footnote: Preceding Ca da Mosto’s day another eruption (1492) was\nnoted by Columbus, shortly before his discovery of the Antilles.\nGarachico was the only port in Tenerife, with a breakwater of\nrocky isle and water so deep that the yardarms of men-of-war could\nalmost touch the vineyards. Its quays were bordered by large\nprovision-stores, it had five convents, and its slopes were dotted with\nvillas. After an earthquake during the night a lava-stream from several\ncones destroyed the village Del Tanque at 3:30 A.M., and at 9\nP.M. another flood entered Garachico at seven points, drove off the sea,\nruined the mole, and filled the port. It was followed by a cascade of\nfire at 8 A.M. on the 13th of the same month, and the lava remained\nincandescent for forty days.] overwhelmed ’Grarachico, pueblo rico,’",
        "[Footnote: Alluding to the curse of the Franciscan Friar, who devoted\nthe town to destruction in these words:–",
        "  ’Garachico, pueblo rico,\n   Gastadero de dinero,\n   Mal risco te caiga encima!’]",
        "and spared Guimar, which it enclosed between two fiery streams. Despite\nthe white and woolly mists, the panorama of elevations, craters and\ncastellated eminences, separated by deep gashes and by currals\nlike those of Madeira, but verdure-bare, was stupendous. I have\npreserved, however, little beyond names and heights. We did not suffer\nfrom puna, or mountain sickness, which Bishop Sprat, of\nRochester, mentions in 1650, and which Mr. Darwin–alas that we must\nwrite the late!–cured by botanising. I believe that it mostly results\nfrom disordered liver, and, not unfrequently, in young Alpinists, from\nindigestion.",
        "The descent of the Teyde Piton, in Vesuvian fashion, occupied ten\nminutes. Our guides now whistled to their comrades below, who had\nremained in charge of the animals. Old authors tell us that the Guanche\nwhistle could be heard for two leagues, and an English traveller\ndeclares that after an experiment close to his ear he did not quite\nrecover its use for a fortnight. The return home was wholly without\ninterest, except the prospects of cloud-land, grander than those of\nFolkestone, which seemed to open another world beneath our feet. Near\nthe Santa Clara village all turned out to prospect two faces which must\nhave suggested only raw beef-steaks. It was Sunday, and",
        "(Garachico, wealthy town; wasteful of thy wealth, may an ill rock fall\nupon thy head!)",
        "both sexes were in their ’braws.’ The men wore clean blanket-mantles,\nthe women coloured corsets laced in front, gowns of black serge or\ncotton, dark blue shawls hardly reaching to their waist, and the usual\nwhite kerchief, the Arab kufiyah, under the broad-brimmed straw\nor felt hat, whose crown was decorated with the broadest and gayest\nribbons. But even this unpicturesque coiffure, almost worthy of Sierra\nLeone, failed to conceal the nobility of face and figure, the\nwell-turned limbs, the fine hands and feet, and the meneo, or\nswimming walk, of this Guanchinesque race, which everywhere forced\nitself upon the sight. The proverb says–",
        "It is curious to compare the realistic accounts of the nineteenth\ncentury with those of the vulcanio two centuries ago. Ogilby\n(1670) tells us that the Moors called it El-Bard (Cold), and we the\n’Pike of Teneriff, thought not to have its equal in the world for\nheight, because it spires with its top so high into the clouds that in\nclear weather it may be seen sixty Dutch miles off at sea.’ His\nillustration of the ’Piek-Bergh op het Eilant Teneriffe’ shows an almost\nperpendicular tower of natural masonry rising from a low sow-back whose\nend is the ’Punt Tenago’ (Anaga Point). The ’considerable merchants and\npersons of credit,’ whose ascent furnished material for the Royal\nSociety, set out from Orotava. ’In the ascent of one mile some of our\nCompany grew very faint and sick, disorder’d by Fluxes, Vomitings, and\nAguish Distempers; our Horses’ Hair standing upright like Bristles.’\nHigher up ’their Strong waters had lost their Virtue, and were almost\ninsipid, while their Wine was more spirituous and brisk than before.’ In\nthose days also iron and copper, silver and gold, were found in the\ncalcined rocks of the Katakaumenon. It is strange to note how much more\nwas seen by ancient travellers than by us moderns.",
