        "Much of the material for this volume was collected during the\ntime that I was preparing for the press the Evolution of Woman,\nor while searching for data bearing on the subject of\nsex-specialization.  While preparing that book for publication,\nit was my intention to include within it this branch of my\ninvestigation, but wishing to obtain certain facts relative to\nthe foundations of religious belief and worship which were not\naccessible at that time, and knowing that considerable labor and\npatience would be required in securing these facts, I decided to\npublish the first part of the work, withholding for the time\nbeing that portion of it pertaining especially to the development\nof the God-idea.",
        "As mankind construct their own gods, or as the prevailing ideas\nof the unknowable reflect the inner consciousness of human\nbeings, a trustworthy history of the growth of religions must\ncorrespond to the processes involved in the mental, moral, and\nsocial development of the individual and the nation.",
        "By means of data brought forward in these later times relative to\nthe growth of the God-idea, it is observed that an independent\nchain of evidence has been produced in support of the facts\nrecently set forth bearing upon the development of the two\ndiverging lines of sexual demarcation.  In other words, it has\nbeen found that sex is the fundamental fact not only in the\noperations of Nature but in the construction of a god.",
        "In the Evolution of Woman it has been shown that the peculiar\ninheritance of the two sexes, female and male, is the result of\nthe bias given to these separate lines of development during the\nearliest periods of sex-differentiation; and, as this division of\nlabor was a necessary step in the evolutionary processes, the\nrate of progress depended largely on the subsequent adjustment of\nthese two primary elements or forces.  A comprehensive study of\nprehistoric records shows that in an earlier age of existence\nupon the earth, at a time when woman’s influence was in the\nascendancy over that of man, human energy was directed by the\naltruistic characters which originated in and have been\ntransmitted through the female; but after the decline of woman’s\npower, all human institutions, customs, forms, and habits of\nthought are seen to reflect the egoistic qualities acquired by\nthe male.",
        "Nowhere is the influence of sex more plainly manifested than in\nthe formulation of religious conceptions and creeds.  With the\nrise of male power and dominion, and the corresponding repression\nof the natural female instincts, the principles which originally\nconstituted the God-idea gradually gave place to a Deity better\nsuited to the peculiar bias which had been given to the male\norganism.  An anthropomorphic god like that of the Jews–a god\nwhose chief attributes are power and virile might–could have had\nits origin only under a system of masculine rule.",
        "Religion is especially liable to reflect the vagaries and\nweaknesses of human nature; and, as the forms and habits of\nthought connected with worship take a firmer hold on the mental\nconstitution than do those belonging to any other department of\nhuman experience, religious conceptions should be subjected to\nfrequent and careful examination in order to perceive, if\npossible, the extent to which we are holding on to ideas which\nare unsuited to existing conditions.",
        "In an age when every branch of inquiry is being subjected to\nreasonable criticism, it would seem that the origin and growth of\nreligion should be investigated from beneath the surface, and\nthat all the facts bearing upon it should be brought forward as a\ncontribution to our fund of general information.  As well might\nwe hope to gain a complete knowledge of human history by studying\nonly the present aspect of society, as to expect to reach\nreasonable conclusions respecting the prevailing God-idea by\ninvestigating the various creeds and dogmas of existing faiths.",
        "The object of this volume is not only to furnish a brief outline\nof religious growth, but to show the effect which each of the two\nforces, female and male, has had on the development of our\npresent God- idea, which investigation serves to accentuate the\nconclusions arrived at in the Evolution of Woman relative to the\ninheritance of each of the two lines of sexual demarcation.",
        "E.B.G.",
        "Through a study of the primitive god-idea as manifested in\nmonumental records in various parts of the world; through\nscientific investigation into the early religious conceptions of\nmankind as expressed by symbols which appear in the architecture\nand decorations of sacred edifices and shrines; by means of a\ncareful examination of ancient holy objects and places still\nextant in every quarter of the globe, and through the study of\nantique art, it is not unlikely that a line of investigation has\nbeen marked out whereby a tolerably correct knowledge of the\nprocesses involved in our present religious systems may be\nobtained.  The numberless figures and sacred emblems which appear\ncarved in imperishable stone in the earliest cave temples; the\nhuge towers, monoliths, and rocking stones found in nearly every\ncountry of the globe, and which are known to be closely connected\nwith primitive belief and worship, and the records found on\ntablets which are being unearthed in various parts of the world,\nare, with the unravelling of extinct tongues, proving an almost\ninexhaustible source for obtaining information bearing upon the\nearly history of the human race, and, together, furnish\nindisputable evidence of the origin, development, and unity of\nreligious faiths.",
        "By comparing the languages used by the earlier races to express\ntheir religious conceptions; by observing the similarity in the\nmythoses and sacred appellations among all tribe and nations, an\nthrough the discovery of the fact that the legends extant in the\nvarious countries of the globe are identical, or have the same\nfoundation, it is probable that a clue has already been obtained\nwhereby an outline of the religious history of the human family\nfrom a period even as remote as the “first dispersion,” or from a\ntime when one race comprehended the entire population of the\nglobe, maybe traced.  Humboldt in his Researches observes: “In\nevery part of the globe, on the ridge of the Cordilleras as well\nas in the Isle of Samothrace, in the Aegean Sea, fragments of\nprimitive languages are preserved in religious rites.”",
        "Regarding the identity of the fundamental ideas contained in the\nvarious systems of religion, both past and present, Hargrave\nJennings, in referring to a parallel drawn by Sir William Jones,\nbetween the deities of Meru and Olympus, observes:",
        "“All our speculations tend to the same conclusions.  One day it\nis a discovery of cinerary vases, the next, it is etymological\nresearch; yet again it is ethnological investigation, and the day\nafter, it is the publication of unsuspected tales from the Norse;\nbut all go to heap up proof of our consanguinity with the peoples\nof history–and of an original general belief, we might add.”",
        "That the religious systems of India and Egypt were originally the\nsame, there can be at the present time no reasonable doubt.  The\nfact noted by various writers, of the British Sepoys, who, on\ntheir overland route from India, upon beholding the ruins of\nDendera, prostrated themselves before the remains of the ancient\ntemples and offered adoration to them, proves the identity of\nIndian and Egyptian deities.  These foreign devotees, being asked\nto explain the reason of their strange conduct declared that they\n\"saw sculptured before them the gods of their country.”",
        "Upon the subject of the identity of Eastern religions, Wilford\nremarks that one and the same code both of theology and of\nfabulous history, has been received through a range or belt about\nforty degrees broad across the old continent, in a southeast and\nnorthwest direction from the eastern shores of the Malaga\npeninsula to the western extremity of the British Isles, that,\nthrough this immense range the same religious notions reappear in\nvarious places under various modifications, as might be expected;\nand that there is not a greater difference between the tenets and\nworship of the Hindoos and the Greeks than exists between the\nchurches of Home and Geneva.",
        "Concerning the universality of certain religious beliefs and\nopinions, Faber, commenting upon the above statement of Wilford,\nobserves that, immense as is this territorial range, it is by far\ntoo limited to include the entire phenomenon, that the\nobservation",
        "“applies with equal propriety to the entire habitable globe; for\nthe arbitrary rites and opinions of every pagan nation bear so\nclose a resemblance to each other, that such a coincidence can\nonly have been produced by their having had a common origin. \nBarbarism itself has not been able to efface the strong primeval\nimpression.  Vestiges of the ancient general system may be traced\nin the recently discovered islands in the Pacific Ocean; and,\nwhen the American world was first opened to the hardy adventurers\nof Europe, its inhabitants from north to south venerated, with\nkindred ceremonies and kindred notions, the gods of Egypt and\nHindostan, of Greece and Italy, of Phoenicia and Britain.\"[1]",
        "[1] Pagan Idolatry, book i., ch. i.",
        "“Though each religion has its own peculiar growth, the seed from\nwhich they spring is everywhere the same.\"[2]",
        "[2] Max Muller, Origin and Growth of Religion, p. 48.",
        "The question as to whether the identity of conception and the\nsimilarity in detail observed in religious rites, ceremonies, and\nsymbols in the various countries of the globe are due to the\nuniversal law of unity which governs human development, or\nwhether, through the dispersion of one original people, the early\nconceptions of a Deity were spread broadcast over the entire\nearth, is perhaps not settled; yet, from the facts which have\nbeen brought forward during the last century, the latter theory\nseems altogether probable, such divergence in religious ideas as\nis observed among the various peoples of the earth being\nattributable to variations in temperament caused by changed\nconditions of life.  In other words, the divergence in the course\nof religious development has doubtless been due to environment.",
        "In an attempt to understand the history of the growth of the\ngod-idea, the fact should be borne in mind that, from the\nearliest conception of a creative force in the animal and\nvegetable world to the latest development in theological\nspeculation, there has never been what might consistently be\ntermed a new religion.  On the contrary, religion like everything\nelse is subject to the law of growth; therefore the faiths of\nto-day are the legitimate result, or outcome, of the primary idea\nof a Deity developed in accordance with the laws governing the\npeculiar instincts which have been in the ascendancy during the\nlife of mankind on the earth.",
        "The erroneous impression which under a belief in the unknown has\ncome to prevail, namely, that the moral law is the result of\nreligion; or, in other words, that the human conscience is in\nsome manner dependent on supernaturalism for its origin and\nmaintenance, is, with a better and clearer understanding of the\npast history of the development of the human race, being\ngradually dispelled.  On one point we may reasonably rest assured\nthat the knowledge of right and wrong and our sense of justice\nand right-living have been developed quite independently of all\nreligious beliefs.  The moral law embodied in the golden rule is\nnot an outgrowth of mysticism, or of man’s notions of the\nunknowable; but, on the contrary, is the result of experience,\nand was formulated in response to a recognized law of human\nnecessity,–a law which involves the fundamental principle of\nprogress.  The history of human development shows conclusively\nthat mankind GREW into the recognition of the moral law, that\nthrough sympathy, or a desire for the welfare of others,–a\ncharacter which had its root in maternal affection,–conscience\nand the moral sense were evolved.",
        "While the moral law and the conscience may not be accounted as in\nany sense the result of man’s ideas concerning the unknowable,\nneither can the errors and weaknesses developed in human nature\nbe regarded as the result of religion.  Although the sexual\nexcesses which during three or four thousand years were practiced\nas sacred rites, and treated as part and parcel of religion in\nvarious parts of the world, have had the effect to stimulate and\nstrengthen the animal nature in man, yet these rites may not be\naccounted as the primary cause of the supremacy of the lower\nnature over the higher faculties.  On the contrary, the impulse\nwhich has been termed religion, with all the vagaries which its\nhistory presents, is to be regarded more as an effect than as a\ncause.  The stage of a nation’s development regulates its\nreligion.  Man creates his own gods; they are powerless to change\nhim.",
        "As written history records only those events in human experience\nwhich belong to a comparatively recent period of man’s existence,\nand as the primitive conceptions of a Deity lie buried beneath\nages of corruption, glimpses of the earlier faiths of mankind, as\nhas already been stated, must be looked for in the traditions,\nmonuments, and languages of extinct races.",
        "In reviewing this matter we shall doubtless observe the fact that\nif the stage of a nation’s growth is indicated by its religious\nconceptions, and if remnants of religious beliefs are everywhere\npresent in the languages, traditions, and monuments of the past\nthrough a careful study of these subjects we may expect to gain a\ntolerably correct understanding not alone of the growth of the\ngod-idea but of the stage of development reached by the nations\nwhich existed prior to the beginning of the historic age.  We\nshall be enabled also to perceive whether or not the course of\nhuman development during the intervening ages has been\ncontinuous, or whether, for some cause hitherto unexplained, true\nprogress throughout a portion of this time has been arrested,\nthus producing a backward movement, or degeneracy.",
        "If we would unravel the mysteries involved in present religious\nfaiths, we should begin not by attempting to analyze or explain\nany existing system or systems of belief and worship.  Such a\ncourse is likely to end not only in confusion and in a subsequent\ndenial of the existence of the religious nature in mankind, but\nis liable, also, to create an aversion for and a distrust of the\nentire subject of religious experience.  In view of this fact it\nwould appear to be not only useless but exceedingly unwise to\nspend one’s time in attempting to gain a knowledge of this\nsubject simply by studying the later developments in its history.",
        "If we are really desirous of obtaining information regarding\npresent religious phenomena, it is plain that we should adopt the\nscientific method and turn our attention to the remote past,\nwhere, by careful and systematic investigation, we are enabled to\nperceive the earliest conception of a creative force and the\nfundamental basis of all religious systems, from which may be\ntraced the gradual development of the god-idea.",
        "In the study of primitive religion, the analogy existing between\nthe growth of the god-idea and the development of the human race,\nand especially of the two sex-principles, is everywhere clearly\napparent.",
        "“Religion is to be found alone with its justification and\nexplanation in the relations of the sexes.  There and therein\nonly.\"[3]",
        "[3] Hargrave Jennings, Phallicism.",
        "As the conception of a deity originated in sex, or in the\ncreative agencies female and male which animate Nature, we may\nreasonably expect to find, in the history of the development of\nthe two sex-principles and in the notions entertained concerning\nthem throughout past ages, a tolerably correct account of the\ngrowth of the god-idea.  We shall perceive that during an earlier\nage of human existence, not only were the reproductive powers\nthroughout Nature, and especially in human beings and in animals,\nvenerated as the Creator, but we shall find also that the\nprevailing ideas relative to the importance of either sex in the\noffice of reproduction decided the sex of this universal creative\nforce.  We shall observe also that the ideas of a god have always\ncorresponded with the current opinions regarding the importance\nof either sex in human society.  In other words, so long as\nfemale power and influence were in the ascendency, the creative\nforce was regarded as embodying the principles of the female\nnature; later, however, when woman’s power waned, and the\nsupremacy of man was gained, the god-idea began gradually to\nassume the male characters and attributes.",
        "Through scientific research the fact has been observed that, for\nages after life appeared on the earth, the male had no separate\nexistence; that the two sex-principles, the sperm and the germ,\nwere contained within one and the same individual.  Through the\nprocesses of differentiation, however, these elements became\ndetached, and with the separation of the male from the female,\nthe reproductive functions were henceforth confided to two\nseparate individuals.",
        "As originally, throughout Nature, the female was the visible\norganic unit within whom was contained the exclusive creative\npower, and as throughout the earlier ages of life on the earth\nshe comprehended the male, it is not perhaps singular that, even\nafter the appearance of mankind on the earth, the greater\nimportance of the mother element in human society should have\nbeen recognized; nor, as the power to bring forth coupled with\nperceptive wisdom originally constituted the Creator, that the\ngod-idea should have been female instead of male.",
        "From the facts to be observed in relation to this subject, it is\naltogether probable that for ages the generating principle\nthroughout Nature was venerated as female; but with that increase\nof knowledge which was the result of observation and experience,\njuster or more correct ideas came to prevail, and subsequently\nthe great fructifying energy throughout the universe came to be\nregarded as a dual indivisible force–female and male.  This\nforce, or agency, constituted one God, which, as woman’s\nfunctions in those ages were accounted of more importance than\nthose of man, was oftener worshipped under the form of a female\nfigure.",
        "Neith, Minerva, Athene, and Cybele, the most important deities of\ntheir respective countries, were adored as Perceptive Wisdom, or\nLight, while Ceres and others represented Fertility.  With the\nincoming of male dominion and supremacy, however, we observe the\ndesire to annul the importance of the female and to enthrone one\nall-powerful male god whose chief attributes were power and\nmight.",
        "Notwithstanding the efforts which during the historic period have\nbeen put forward to magnify the importance of the male both in\nhuman affairs and in the god-idea, still, no one, I think, can\nstudy the mythologies and traditions of the nations of antiquity\nwithout being impressed with the prominence given to the female\nelement, and the deeper the study the stronger will this\nimpression grow.",
        "During a certain stage of human development, religion was but a\nrecognition of and a reliance upon the vivifying or fructifying\nforces throughout Nature, and in the earlier ages of man’s\ncareer, worship consisted for the most part in the celebration of\nfestivals at stated seasons of the year, notably during seed-time\nand harvest, to commemorate the benefits derived from the grain\nfield and vineyard.",
        "Doubtless the first deified object was Gaia, the Earth.  As\nwithin the bosom of the earth was supposed to reside the\nfructifying, life-giving power, and as from it were received all\nthe bounties of life, it was female.  It was the Universal\nMother, and to her as to no other divinity worshipped by mankind,\nwas offered a spontaneity of devotion and a willing\nacknowledgment of dependence.  Thus far in the history of mankind\nno temples dedicated to an undefined and undefinable God had been\nraised.  The children of Mother Earth met in the open air,\nwithout the precincts of any man-made shrine, and under the\naerial canopy of heaven, acknowledged the bounties of the great\nDeity and their dependence upon her gifts.  She was a beneficent\nand all-wise God, a tender and loving parent–a mother, who\ndemanded no bleeding sacrifice to reconcile her to her children. \nThe ceremonies observed at these festive seasons consisted for\nthe most part in merry-making and in general thanksgiving, in\nwhich the gratitude of the worshippers found expression in song\nand dance, and in invocations to their Deity for a return or\ncontinuance of her gifts.",
        "Subsequently, through the awe and reverence inspired by the\nmysteries involved in birth and life, the adoration of the\ncreative principles in vegetable existence became supplemented by\nthe worship of the creative functions in human beings and in\nanimals.  The earth, including the power inherent in it by which\nthe continuity of existence is maintained, and by which new forms\nare continuously called into life, embodied the idea of God; and,\nas this inner force was regarded as inherent in matter, or as a\nmanifestation of it, in process of time earth and the heavens,\nbody and spirit, came to be worshipped under the form of a mother\nand her child, this figure being the highest expression of a\nCreator which the human mind was able to conceive.  Not only did\nthis emblem represent fertility, or the fecundating energies of\nNature, but with the power to create were combined or correlated\nall the mental qualities and attributes of the two sexes.  In\nfact the whole universe was contained in the Mother idea–the\nchild, which was sometimes female, sometimes male, being a scion\nor offshoot from the eternal or universal unit.",
        "Underlying all ancient mythologies may be observed the idea that\nthe earth, from which all things proceed, is female.  Even in the\nmythology of the Finns, Lapps, and Esths, Mother Earth is the\ndivinity adored.  Tylor calls attention to the same idea in the\nmythology of England,",
        "“from the days when the Anglo-Saxon called upon the Earth, ’Hal\nwes thu folde fira modor’ (Hail, thou Earth, men’s mother), to\nthe time when mediaeval Englishmen made a riddle of her asking\n’Who is Adam’s mother?’ and poetry continued what mythology was\nletting fall, when Milton’s Archangel promised Adam a life to\nlast    \n’.  .  .  till like ripe fruit thou drop          \nInto thy Mother’s lap.’ “[4]",
        "[4] Primitive Culture, vol.  i., p. 295.",
        "In the old religion the sky was the husband of the earth and the\nearth was mother of all the gods.[5] In the traditions of past\nages the fact is clearly perceived that there was a time when the\nmother was not only the one recognized parent on earth, but that\nthe female principle was worshipped as the more important\ncreative force throughout Nature.",
        "[5] Max Muller, Origin and Growth of Religion, p. 279.",
        "Doubtless the worship of the female energy prevailed under the\nmatriarchal system, and was practised at a time when women were\nthe recognized heads of families and when they were regarded as\nthe more important factors in human society.  The fact has been\nshown in a previous work that after women began to leave their\nhomes at marriage, and after property, especially land, had\nfallen under the supervision and control of men, the latter, as\nthey manipulated all the necessaries of life and the means of\nsupplying them, began to regard themselves as superior beings,\nand later, to claim that as a factor in reproduction, or\ncreation, the male was the more important.  With this change the\nideas of a Deity also began to undergo a modification.  The dual\nprinciple necessary to creation, and which had hitherto been\nworshipped as an indivisible unity, began gradually to separate\ninto its individual elements, the male representing spirit, the\nmoving or forming force in the generative processes, the female\nbeing matter–the instrument through which spirit works.  Spirit\nwhich is eternal had produced matter which is destructible.  The\nfact will be observed that this doctrine prevails to a greater or\nless extent in the theologies of the present time.",
        "A little observation and reflection will show us that during this\nchange in the ideas relative to a creative principle, or God,\ndescent and the rights of succession which had hitherto been\nreckoned through the mother were changed from the female to the\nmale line, the father having in the meantime become the only\nrecognized parent.  In the Eumenides of Aeschylus, the plea of\nOrestes in extenuation of his crime is that he is not of kin to\nhis mother.  Euripides, also, puts into the mouth of Apollo the\nsame physiological notion, that she who bears the child is only\nits nurse.  The Hindoo Code of Menu, which, however, since its\nearliest conception, has undergone numberless mutilations to suit\nthe purposes of the priests, declares that “the mother is but the\nfield which brings forth the plant according to whatsoever seed\nis sown.”",
        "Although, through the accumulation of property in masses and the\ncapture of women for wives, men had succeeded in gaining the\nascendancy, and although the doctrine had been propounded that\nthe father is the only parent, thereby reversing the established\nmanner of reckoning descent, still, as we shall hereafter\nobserve, thousands of years were required to eliminate the female\nelement from the god-idea.",
        "We must not lose sight of the fact that human society was first\norganized and held together by means of the gens, at the head of\nwhich was a woman.  The several members of this organization were\nbut parts of one body cemented together by the pure principle of\nmaternity, the chief duty of these members being to defend and\nprotect each other if needs be with their life blood.  The fact\nhas been observed, in an earlier work, that only through the gens\nwas the organization of society possible.  Without it mankind\ncould have accomplished nothing toward its own advancement.",
        "Thus, throughout the earlier ages of human existence, at a time\nwhen mankind lived nearer to Nature and before individual wealth\nand the stimulation of evil passions had engendered superstition,\nselfishness, and distrust, the maternal element constituted not\nonly the binding and preserving principle in human society, but,\ntogether with the power to bring forth, constituted also the\ngod-idea, which idea, as has already been observed, at a certain\nstage in the history of the race was portrayed by a female figure\nwith a child in her arms.",
        "From all sources of information at hand are to be derived\nevidences of the fact that the earliest religion of which we have\nany account was pure Nature-worship, that whatever at any given\ntime might have been the object adored, whether it were the\nearth, a tree, water, or the sun, it was simply as an emblem of\nthe great energizing agency in Nature.  The moving or forming\nforce in the universe constituted the god-idea.  The figure of a\nmother with her child signified not only the power to bring\nforth, but Perceptive Wisdom, or Light, as well.",
        "As through a study of Comparative Ethnology, or through an\ninvestigation into the customs, traditions, and mythoses of\nextant races in the various stages of development, have been\ndiscovered the beginnings of the religious idea and the mental\nqualities which among primitive races prompted worship, so, also,\nthrough extinct tongues and the symbolism used in religious rites\nand ceremonies, many of the processes have been unearthed whereby\nthe original and beautiful conceptions of the Deity, and the\nworship inspired by the operations of Nature, and especially the\ncreative functions in human beings gradually became obscured by\nthe grossest ideas and the vilest practices.  The symbols which\nappear in connection with early religious rites and ceremonies,\nand under which are veiled the conceptions of a still earlier and\npurer age, when compared with subsequently developed notions\nrelative to the same objects, indicate plainly the change which\nhas been wrought in the original ideas relative to the creative\nfunctions, and furnish an index to the direction which human\ndevelopment, or growth, has taken.",
        "As the human race constructs its own gods, and as by the\nconceptions involved in the deities worshipped at any given time\nin the history of mankind we are able to form a correct estimate\nof the character, temperament, and aspirations of the\nworshippers, so the history of the gods of the race, as revealed\nto us through the means of symbols, monumental records, and the\ninvestigation of extinct tongues, proves that from a stage of\nNature worship and a pure and rational conception of the creative\nforces in the universe, mankind, in course of time, degenerated\ninto mere devotees of sensual pleasure.  With the corruption of\nhuman nature and the decline of mental power which followed the\nsupremacy of the animal instincts, the earlier abstract idea of\nGod was gradually lost sight of, and man himself in the form of a\npotentate or ruler, together with the various emblems of\nvirility, came to be worshipped as the Creator.  From adorers of\nan abstract creative principle, mankind had lapsed into\nworshippers of the symbols under which this principle had been\nveiled.",
        "Although at certain stages in the history of the human race the\nevils, which as a result of the supremacy of the ruder elements\ndeveloped in mankind had befallen the race were lamented and\nbewailed, they could not be suppressed.  Man had become a lost\nand ruined creature.  The golden age had passed away.",
        "When mankind first began to perceive the fact of an all-pervading\nagency throughout Nature, by or through which everything is\nproduced, and when they began to speculate on the origin of life\nand the final cause and destiny of things, it is not in the least\nremarkable that various objects and elements, such as fire, air,\nwater, trees, etc., should in their turn have been venerated as\nin some special manner embodying the divine essence.  Neither is\nit surprising although this universal agency was regarded as one,\nor as a dual entity, they should have recognized its manifold\nexpressions or manifestations.",
        "To primitive man, the visible sources whence proceeded his daily\nsustenance doubtless constituted the first objects of his regard\nand adoration.  Hence, in addition to the homage paid to the\nearth, in due course of time would be added the worship of trees,\nupon which the early race was directly dependent for food.  At a\ntime when the art of agriculture had not been attained, all such\ntrees as yielded their fruit for the support of the human race,\nand which afforded to mankind pleasant beverages or cooling\nshade, would come to be regarded as embodying the universal\nbeneficent principle–the great creating and preserving agency of\nNature, and therefore as proper objects of veneration.",
        "According to the Phoenician theogony, “the first gods which were\nworshipped by oblations and sacrifices were the fruits of the\nearth, on which they and their descendants lived as their\nforefathers had done.”",
        "Although, after the art of agriculture had been developed,\nmankind was gradually relieved from its past dependence on the\ntree as a means of support, it nevertheless continued to be\nregarded with veneration as an emblem of creative power or of\nproductive energy.",
        "Among the traditions and monuments of nearly every country of the\nglobe are to be found traces of a sacred tree–a Tree of Life. \nIn various countries there appear two traditional trees, the one\ntypical of the continuation of physical life, the other\nrepresenting spiritual life, or the life of the soul.  After the\nage of pure Nature-worship had passed, however, and serpent,\nfire, and phallic faiths had been introduced, the original\nsignification of the tree, like that of all other religious\nemblems, became considerably changed.  Through its energies, or\nlife-giving properties, existence had long been maintained, and\nfor this reason, as has already been observed, it became an\nobject of veneration; but, after the reproductive power in man\nhad risen to the dignity of a supreme God, the tree, to the\nmasses of the people, became a symbol of the physical,\nlife-giving energy in mortals and in animals.  In other words, it\nbecame a phallic emblem representing the continuation of\nexistence, or the power to reproduce or continue life on the\nearth.

And the Cup of the Lord in such wise\ninebriates, as Noe also was intoxicated drinking wine in Genesis. \n.  .  .  For because Christ bore us all, in that he also bore our\nsins, we see that in the water is understood the people, but in\nthe wine is showed the blood of Christ.  .  .  .  Thus,\ntherefore, in consecrating the Cup of the Lord, water alone\ncannot be offered, even as wine alone cannot be offered.

This plant grows in the\nwater, and amongst its broad leaves puts forth a flower, in the\ncenter of which is formed the seed vessel, shaped like a bell or\ninverted cone, and punctured on the top with little cavities or\ncells, in which the seeds grow.  The orifices of these cells\nbeing too small to let the seeds drop out when ripe, they shoot\nforth into new plants, in the places where they were formed, the\nbulb of the vessel serving as a matrix to nourish them until they\nacquire such a degree of magnitude as to burst it open and\nrelease themselves, after which, like other aquatic weeds, they\ntake root wherever the current deposits them.  This plant,\ntherefore, being thus productive of itself, and vegetating from\nits own matrix, without being fostered in the earth, was\nnaturally adopted as the symbol of the productive power of the\nwaters, upon which the creative spirit of the Creator operated in\ngiving life and vegetation to matter.  We accordingly find it\nemployed in every part of the Northern hemisphere, where the\nsymbolical religion improperly called idolatry does or did\nprevail.  The sacred images of the Tartars, Japanese, and Indians\nare almost all placed upon it, of which numerous instances occur\nin the publication of Kaempfer, Sonnerat, etc: The Brama of India\nis represented sitting upon a lotus throne, and the figures upon\nthe Isaic table hold the stem of this plant, surmounted by the\nseed vessel in one hand, and the cross representing the male\norgans in the other: thus signifying the universal power, both\nactive and passive, attributed to that goddess.\"[19]",

        "Of “Aditi, the boundless, the yonder, the beyond all and\neverything,” Max Muller says that in later times she “may have\nbecome identified with the sky, also with the earth, but\noriginally she was far beyond the sky and the earth.\"[24] The\nsame writer quotes the following, also from a hymn of the\nRig-Veda:",

        "Aditi is the Great She that Is, the Everlasting.  Muller refers\nto the fact that another Hindoo poet “speaks of the dawn as the\nface of Aditi; thus indicating that Aditi is here not the dawn\nitself, but something beyond the dawn.”  This Goddess, who is\ndesignated as the “Oldest,” is implored “not only to drive away\ndarkness and enemies that lurk in the dark, but likewise to\ndeliver man from any sin which he may have committed.”  “May\nAditi by day protect our cattle, may she, who never deceives,\nprotect us from evil.”",
        "In the Egyptian as in the Indian and Hebrew religions, the two\ngenerating principles throughout Nature represent the Infinite,\nthe Holy of Holies, the Elohim or Aleim–the Ieue.  Within the\nrecords of the earliest religions of Ethiopia or Arabia, Chaldea,\nAssyria, and Babylonia, is revealed the same monad principle in\nthe Deity.  This monad conception, or dual unity, this God of\nLight and Life, or of Wisdom and generative force, is the same\nsource whence all mythologies have sprung, and, as has been\nstated, among all peoples the fact is observed that the religious\nidea has followed substantially the same course of development,\nor growth.  Within the sacred writings of the Hindoos there is\nbut one Almighty Power, usually denominated as Brahm or Brahme–\nOm or Aum.  This word in India was regarded with the same degree\nof veneration as was the sacred Ieue of the Jews.  In later ages,\nthe fact is being proved that this God, into whom all the deities\nworshipped at a certain period in human history resolve\nthemselves, is the sun, or if not the actual corporeal sun, then\nthe supreme agency within it which was acknowledged as the great\ncreative or life-force– that dual principle which by the early\nraces was recognized as Elohim, Om, Ormuzd, etc., and from which\nthe productive power in human beings, in plants, and in animals\nwas thought to emanate.",
        "Prior to the development of either tree or phallic worship, the\nsun as an emblem of the Deity had doubtless become the principal\nobject of veneration.  Ages would probably elapse before\nprimitive man would observe that all life is dependent on the\nwarmth of the sun’s rays, or before from experience he would\nperceive the fact that to its agency as well as to that of the\nearth he was indebted both for food and the power of motion. \nHowever, as soon as this knowledge had been gained, the great orb\nof day would assume the most prominent place among the objects of\nhis regard and adoration.  That such has been the case, that the\nsun, either as the actual Creator, or as an emblem of the great\nenergizing force in Nature, has been worshipped by every nation\nof the globe, there is no lack of evidence to prove; neither do\nwe lack proof to establish the fact that, since the adoption of\nthe sun as a divine object, or perhaps I should say as the emblem\nof Wisdom and creative power, it has never been wholly eliminated\nfrom the god-idea of mankind.",

At that\ntime there had been no division in the god-idea.  The Creator\nconstituted a dual but indivisible unity.

If the word Am means Mother, then\na still more recondite idea will be implied, viz.: the mother\ngenerative power, or the maternal generative power: perhaps the\nUrania of Persia or the Venus Aphrodite of Crete and Greece, or\nthe Jupiter Genetrix of the masculine and feminine gender, or the\nBrahme Mai of India, or the Alma Venus of Lucretius.

The heathen divinities Ashtaroth and Beelzebub were both\ncalled Aleim, Ashtaroth being simply Astarte adorned with the\nhorns of a ram.  Ishtar not unfrequently appears with the horns\nof a cow.  We are informed by Inman that whenever a goddess is\nobserved with horns–emblems which by the way always indicate\nmasculine power–it is to denote the fact that she is\nandrogynous, or that within her is embodied the complete\nDeity–the dual reproductive energy throughout Nature.

As soon as one is divested of a belief in the\npopular but erroneous opinion that the gods of the early\nEgyptians and Greeks were deified heroes of former ages, he is\nprepared to perceive the fact that, although to the uninitiated\nthese gods appear numberless, in reality they all represent the\nsame idea, namely: the dual, moving force in Nature, together\nwith Light or Wisdom.",
        "We have seen that when among the nations of antiquity\ncivilization had reached its height, the god-idea was represented\nby the figure of a woman with her child; subsequently, however,\nas these nations began to decline, the creative energy\ncomprehended simply physical life, or the power to reproduce, and\nwas represented by various emblems which will be noticed farther\non in this work.  In still later ages, after male reproductive\npower had become God, and when, through superstition and\nsensuality, the masses of the people had descended to the rank of\nslaves, monarchs, representing themselves to their ignorant\nsubjects as the source of all blessings, even of life itself,\nappropriated the titles of the sun, and claimed for themselves\nthe adoration which had formerly belonged to it.  From this fact\nhas doubtless arisen the opinion so tenaciously upheld in recent\ntimes, that the gods of the ancients were only deified heroes of\nformer times.",

As has been hinted, there\nis little doubt that the earliest worship of the woman and child\nwas much simpler than was that which came to prevail in later\nages, at a time when every religious conception was closely\nveiled beneath a mixture of astrology and mythology.

At this time, the 25th of December, and just as the\ndays began to lengthen, this Virgin gave birth to the Sun-God. \nIt is said that he issued forth from her side, hence the legend\nthat Gotama Buddha was produced from the side of Maya, and also\nthe story believed by the Gnostics and other Christian sects that\nJesus was taken from the side of Mary.[31]",

Her temple at Sais was the largest in Egypt. \nIt was open at the top and bore the following inscription: “I am\nall that was and is and is to be; no mortal has lifted up my\nveil, and the fruit which I brought forth was the sun.”  She was\ncalled also Muth, the universal mother.  Kings were especially\nhonored in the title “Son of Neith.”",
        "To express the idea that the female energy in the Deity\ncomprehended not alone the power to bring forth, but that it\ninvolved all the natural powers, attributes, and possibilities of\nhuman nature, it was portrayed by a pure Virgin who was also a\nmother.  According to Herodotus, the worship of Minerva was\nindigenous in Lybia, whence it travelled to Egypt and was carried\nfrom thence to Greece.  Among the remnants of Egyptian mythology,\nthe figure of a mother and child is everywhere observed.  It is\nthought by various writers that the worship of the black virgin\nand child found its way to Italy from Egypt.",
        "The change noted in the growth of the religious idea by which the\nmale principle assumes the more important position in the Deity\nmay, by a close investigation of the facts at hand, be easily\ntraced, and, as has before been expressed, this change will be\nfound to correspond with that which in an earlier age of the\nworld took place in the relative positions of the sexes.  In all\nthe earliest representations of the Deity, the fact is observed\nthat within the mother element is contained the divinity adored,\nwhile the male appears as a child and dependent on the\nministrations of the female for existence and support. \nGradually, however, as the importance of man begins to be\nrecognized in human affairs, we find that the male energy in the\nDeity, instead of appearing as a child in the arms of its mother,\nis represented as a man, and that he is of equal importance with\nthe woman; later he is identical with the sun, the woman,\nalthough still a necessary factor in the god-idea, being\nconcealed or absorbed within the male.  It is no longer woman who\nis to bruise the serpent’s head, but the seed of the woman, or\nthe son.  He is Bacchus in Greece, Adonis in Syria, Christna in\nIndia.  He is indeed the new sun which is born on the 25th of\nDecember, or at the time when the solar orb has reached its\nlowest position and begins to ascend.  It is not perhaps\nnecessary to add that he is also the Christ of Bethlehem, the son\nof the Virgin.",
        "Nowhere, perhaps, is the growing importance of the male in the\ngod-idea more clearly traced than in the history of the Arabians. \nAmong this people are still to be found certain remnants of the\nmatriarchal age–an age in which women were the recognized heads\nof families and the eponymous leaders of the gentes or clans. \nConcerning the worship of a man and woman as god by the early\nArabians, Prof. Robertson Smith remarks:",
        "“Except the comparatively modern Isaf and Naila in the sanctuary\nat Mecca where there are traditions of Syrian influence, I am not\naware that the Arabs had pairs of gods represented as man and\nwife.  In the time of Mohammed the female deities, such as\nAl-lat, were regarded as daughters of the supreme male God.  But\nthe older conception as we see from a Nabataean inscription in De\nVogue, page 119, is that Al-lat is mother of the gods.  At Petra\nthe mother-goddess and her son were worshipped together, and\nthere are sufficient traces of the same thing elsewhere to lead\nus to regard this as having been the general rule when a god and\ngoddess were worshipped in one sanctuary.\"[38]",

        "As the worship of the black virgin and child is connected with\nthe earliest religion of which we may catch a glimpse, the exact\nlocality in which it first appeared must be somewhat a matter of\nconjecture, but that this idea constituted the Deity among the\nEthiopian or early Cushite race, the people who doubtless carried\ncivilization to Egypt, India, and Chaldea, is quite probable.",
        "If we bear in mind the fact that the gods of the ancients\nrepresented principles and powers, we shall not be surprised to\nfind that Muth, Neith, or Isis, who was creator of the sun, was\nalso the first emanation from the sun.  Minerva is Wisdom–the\nLogos, the Word.  She is Perception, Light, etc.  At a later\nstage in the history of religion, all emanations from the Deity\nare males who are “Saviors.”",
        "That the office of the male as a creative agency is dependent on\nthe female, is a fact so patent that for ages the mother\nprinciple could not be eliminated from the conception of a Deity,\nand the homage paid to Athene or Minerva, even after women had\nbecome only sexual slaves and household tools, shows the extent\nto which the idea of female supremacy in Nature and in the Deity\nhad taken root.",
        "Notwithstanding the efforts which during numberless ages were\nmade to dethrone the female principle in the god-idea, the Great\nMother, under some one of her various appellations, continued,\ndown to a late period in the history of the human race, to claim\nthe homage and adoration of a large portion of the inhabitants of\nthe globe.  And so difficult was it, even after the male element\nhad declared itself supreme, to conceive of a creative force\nindependently of the female principle, that oftentimes, during\nthe earlier ages of their attempted separation, great confusion\nand obscurity are observed in determining the positions of male\ndeities.  Zeus who in later times came to be worshipped as male\nwas formerly represented as “the great dyke, the terrible virgin\nwho breathes out on crime, anger, and death.”  Grote refers to\nnumerous writers as authority for the statement that Dionysos,\nwho usually appears in Greece as masculine, and who was doubtless\nthe Jehovah of the Jews, was indigenous in Thrace, Phrygia, and\nLydia as the Great Mother Cybele.  He was identical with Bacchus,\nwho although represented on various coins as a “bearded venerable\nfigure” appears with the limbs, features, and character of a\nbeautiful young woman.  Sometimes this Deity is portrayed with\nsprouting horns, and again with a crown of ivy.  The Phrygian\nAttis and the Syrian Adonis, as represented in monuments of\nancient art, are androgynous personifications of the same\nattributes.  According to the testimony of the geographer\nDionysius, the worship of Bacchus was formerly carried on in the\nBritish Islands in exactly the same manner as it had been in an\nearlier age in Thrace and on the banks of the Ganges.",
        "In referring to the Idean Zeus in Crete, to Demeter at Eleusis,\nto the Cabairi in Samothrace, and Dionysos at Delphi and Thebes,\nGrote observes: “That they were all to a great degree analogous,\nis shown by the way in which they necessarily run together and\nbecome confused in the minds of various authors.”",
        "Concerning Sadi, Sadim, or Shaddai, Higgins remarks:",
        "“Parkhurst tells us it means all-bountiful–the pourer forth of\nblessings; among the Heathen, the Dea Multimammia; in fact the\nDiana of Ephesus, the Urania of Persia, the Jove of Greece,\ncalled by Orpheus the Mother of the Gods, each male as well as\nfemale–the Venus Aphrodite; in short, the genial powers of\nNature.”",
        "To which Higgins adds: “And I maintain that it means the figure\nwhich is often found in collections of ancient statues, most\nbeautifully executed, and called the Hermaphrodite.”",
        "As in the old language there was no neuter gender, the gods must\nalways appear either as female or male.  For apparent reasons, in\nall the translations, through the pronouns and adjectives used,\nthe more important ancient deities have all been made to appear\nas males.",
        "By at least two ancient writers Jupiter is called the Mother of\nthe Gods.  In reference to a certain Greek appellation, Bryant\nobserves that it is a masculine name for a feminine deity–a name\nwhich is said to be a corruption of Mai, the Hindoo Queen of\nHeaven.",
        "In process of time, as the world became more and more\nmasculinized, so important did it become that the male should\noccupy the more exalted place in the Deity, that even the Great\nMother of the Gods, as we have seen, is represented as male.",
        "The androgynous or plural form of the ancient Phoenician God\nAleim, the Creator referred to in the opening chapter of Genesis,\nis clearly apparent.  This God, speaking to his counterpart,\nWisdom, the female energy, says: “Let us make man in our own\nimage, in our own likeness,” and accordingly males and females\nare produced.  By those whose duty it has been in the past to\nprove that the Deity here represented is composed only of the\nmasculine attributes, we are given to understand that God was\nreally “speaking to himself,” and that in his divine cogitations\nexcessive modesty dictated the “polite form of speech\"; he did\nnot, therefore, say exactly what he meant, or at least did not\nmean precisely what he said.  We have to bear in mind, however,\nthat as man had not at that time been created, if there were no\nfemale element present, this excess of politeness on the part of\nthe “Lord” was wholly lost.  Surely, in a matter involving such\nan enormous stretch of power as the creation of man independently\nof the female energy, we would scarcely expect to find the high\nand mighty male potentate which was subsequently worshipped as\nthe Lord of the Israelites laying aside his usual “I the Lord,\"\nsimply out of deference to the animals.",
        "In Christian countries, during the past eighteen hundred years,\nthe greatest care has been exercised to conceal the fact that\nsun-worship underlies all forms of religion, and under Protestant\nChristianity no pains has been spared in eliminating the female\nelement from the god-idea; hence the ignorance which prevails at\nthe present time in relation to the fact that the Creator once\ncomprehended the forces of Nature, which by an older race were\nworshipped as female.",
        "Although the God of the most ancient people was a dual Unity, in\nlater ages it came to be worshipped as a Trinity.  When mankind\nbegan to speculate on the origin of the life principle, they came\nto worship their Deity in its three capacities as Creator,\nPreserver, and Destroyer or Regenerator, each of which was female\nand male.  We have observed that, according to Higgins, when this\nTrinity was spoken of collectively, it was called after the\nfeminine plural.",
        "By the various writers who have dealt with this subject during\nthe last century, much surprise has been manifested over the fact\nthat for untold ages the people of the earth have worshipped a\nTrinity.  Forster, in his Sketches of Hindoo Mythology, says:\n\"One circumstance which forcibly struck my attention was the\nHindoo belief of a Trinity.”",
        "Maurice, in his Indian Antiquities, observes that the idea of\nthree persons in the Deity was diffused amongst all the nations\nof the earth, in regions as distant as Japan and Peru, that it\nwas memorially acknowledged throughout the whole extent of Egypt\nand India, “flourishing with equal vigor amidst the snowy\nmountains of Thibet, and the vast deserts of Siberia.”  The idea\nof a Trinity is supposed to have been first elaborated on the\nbanks of the Indus, whence it was carried to the Greek and Latin\nnations.  Astrologically the triune Deity of the ancients\nportrayed the processes of Nature.",
        "This recondite doctrine as understood by the very ancient people\nwhich originated it, involved a knowledge of Nature far too deep\nto be appreciated or understood by their degenerate descendants,\nexcept perhaps by a few philosophers and scholars who imbibed it\nin a modified form from original sources in the far East.",
        "After the establishment of the Trinity, the creative energy,\nwhich had formerly been represented by a mother and child, came\nto be figured by the mother, father, and the life derived\ntherefrom.  Sometimes the Trinity took the form of the two\ncreative forces, female and male, and the Great Mother.",
        "Whenever the two creative principles were considered separately,\nthere always appeared stationed over or above them, as their\nCreator, an indivisible unity.  This Creator was the “Beyond,\"\nthe “most High God\"–Om or Aleim.  It was the Mother of the Gods\nin whom were contained all the elements of the Deity.  Among the\nrepresentations of the god-idea which are to be observed on the\nmonuments and in the temples of Egypt appear triads, each of\nwhich is composed of a woman stationed between a male figure and\nthat of a child.  She is depicted as the Light of the sun, or\nWisdom, while the male is manifested as the Heat of the orb of\nday.  She is crowned and always bears the male symbol of life–\nthe crux-ansata.",
        "Later, it is observed that the worship of Light has in a measure\ngiven place to the adoration of Heat, in other words Light is no\nlonger adored as essence of the Deity, Heat or Passion having\nbecome the most important element in creative power.",
        "After the ancient worship of the Virgin and Child had become\nsomewhat changed or modified so as to better accommodate itself\nto the growing importance of the male, the most exalted\nconception of the Deity in Egypt seems to have been that of a\ntrinity composed of Mout the Mother, Ammon the Father, and Chons\nthe Infant Life derived from the other two.  Mout is identical\nwith Neith, but she has become the wife as well as the mother of\nAmmon.  Directly below this conception of the Deity is a triad\nrepresenting less exalted attributes, or lower degrees of wisdom,\nunder the appellations of Sate, Kneph, and the child Anouk; and\nthus downward, through the varying spheres of celestial light and\nlife involved in their theogony are observed the divine creative\nenergies represented under the figures of Mother, Father, and the\nLife proceeding therefrom, until, finally, when the earth is\nreached, Isis, Osiris, and Horus appear as the representation of\nthe creative forces in human beings, and therefore as the\nembodiment of the divine in the human.",

As\nthe Sun was the source whence proceeded all light and life as\nwell as reproductive or generative power, it had become the\nobject of adoration, and as the emblem of the Deity, it was\nworshipped by all the nations of the earth in its three\ncapacities as Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer or Regenerator\neach female and male.",

        "The difficulty of the ancients in establishing a First Cause\nseems to have been exactly the same as is ours at the present\ntime.  When we say there must have been a God who created all\nthings, the question at once arises, Who created God? According\nto their theories, nothing could be brought forth without the\ninteraction of two creative principles, female and male; yet\neverything, even these principles, must proceed from an\nindivisible energy–an energy which, as the idea of the sex\nfunctions became more and more clearly defined, could not be\ncontemplated except in its dual aspect.  So soon, therefore, as\nthe Great First Cause was separated into its elements, a still\nhigher power was immediately stationed above it as its Creator. \nThis Creator was designated as female.  It was the Mother idea\nEven gods could not be produced without a mother.",

The curious and ancient doctrine of the\nCreator being both male and female, mentioned on a preceding\npage, to be designated in Indian temples by a very indecent\nexhibition of the masculine and feminine organs of generation in\nunion, occurs in the following passage: ’I am the Father and\nMother of this world; I plant myself upon my own nature and\ncreate again and again this assemblage of beings; I am generation\nand dissolution, the place where all things are deposited, and\nthe inexhaustible seed of all Nature.  I am the beginning, the\nmiddle, and the end of all things.’ “[42]",

        "According to Sir W. Jones, the Brahme, Vishnu, and Siva coalesce\nto form the mystic Om, which means the essence of life or divine\nfire.  In the Bhagavat Geeta the supreme God speaks thus\nconcerning itself: “I am the holy one worthy to be known\"; and\nimmediately adds: “I am the mystic [trilateral] figure Om; the\nReig, the Yagush, and the Saman Vedas.”  It is a unity and still\na trinity.  This Om or Aum stands for the Creator, Preserver, and\nDestroyer or Regenerator, and represents the threefold aspect of\nthe force within the sun.  The doctrine maintained throughout the\nGeeta is not only that the great life-force represents a trinity\nin unity, but that it is both female and male.  On this subject\nMaurice, in his Indian Antiquities, says:",

        "We have observed that the idea of a trinity as conceived by the\nso-called ancients, although at all times founded on the same\nconception, viz., that of the reproductive powers of Nature and\nespecially of mankind, differed in expression according to its\napplication.  Although in human beings this triune creative idea\nwas expressed by the mother, father, and child, as set forth in\nthe temples and on the monuments of Egypt, when applied directly\nto the sun and the planets, it appears as the Creator, Preserver,\nand Regenerator or Destroyer.",
        "Destruction, or the absence of the sun’s heat, represented by\nwinter, was necessary to life, and therefore the Destroyer was\nalso the Regenerator and equally with the Creator and Preserver\nconstituted a beneficent factor in the god-idea.  In fact as this\nthird element really embodied the substance of the other two, it\nfinally became the supreme God, little afterward being heard\nabout the Creator and Preserver.  The Regenerator or Destroyer\nwas of course the sun, which in winter died away and rose again\nin the spring-time as a beneficent Savior or renewer of life. \nThe principle involved in these processes represented Fertility,\nLife, reproductive energy.  As applied to mortals, it\ncomprehended the power to create combined with perceptive Wisdom\nor Knowledge.",
        "This idea, portrayed as it was by a mother and her child, linked\nwoman with the stars.  It produced the “Virgin of the Sphere,\"\nQueen of Heaven, “Isiac Controller of the Zodiac,” at the same\ntime that it made her the mother of all mankind.",
        "Every year this Virgin of the Sphere as she appeared above the\nhorizon at the winter solstice gave birth to the sun. \nAstronomically this new sun was the Regenerator, by which all\nNature was renewed.  Mythologically, after the higher truths\ncontained in these doctrines were lost, it came to be the Savior,\nthe Son of the Virgin, the seed of the woman, which was to bruise\nthe serpent’s head.",
        "That the religion of an ancient race comprehended a knowledge of\nthe evolutionary processes of Nature may not be doubted.  The\nmyths still extant, and even the oldest Assyrian inscriptions\nwhich have been deciphered, reveal the fact that the seeds of the\nvisible universe were hidden in the “great deep\"–that animal\ncreation sprang from the earth and the sea through the influence\nof the sun’s rays.",
        "It is now known that the philosophy of an older race involved a\nbelief in the Eternity of Matter.  The abstruse doctrine of\nReincarnation and the Renewal of Worlds seems to have formed the\nbasis of their philosophy.  According to these speculations, a\nportion of the earth was destroyed or resolved into its primary\nelements every six hundred years, while at the end of each\nKalpia, or great Cycle of several thousand years, the entire\nearth was renovated or absorbed into the two fecundating\nprinciples of the universe.  These two indivisible forces\nrepresented by Vishnu rested in the water, or brooded on the face\nof the deep. When stirred by love for each other they again\nbecame active, and from the germs of a former world, which had\nbeen absorbed by themselves, created again the earth and\neverything upon it.  In other words, “the earth sprang from the\nnavel of Vishnu or Brahme.”  According to the Buddhists of\nCeylon, the universe has perished ten different times, and each\ntime has been renewed by the operations of Nature, or by the\npreservation of germs from a former world.  In their mythology\nthese germs are represented by a parent and a triplicated\noffspring.  It is perhaps unnecessary to add that this monad\ntrinity is the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer with their great\nparent, the Mother of the Gods, which in process of time came to\nbe regarded as male.  According to Wilford, Hindoo chronology\npresents fourteen different periods, six of which have already\nelapsed; we are in the seventh, which began with the flood.  Each\nof these periods is called a Manwantara, the presiding genius or\nDeity of which is a Menu.  At the close of each dynasty a total\ndestruction of the world takes place, everything being destroyed\nexcept the ruler, or Menu, who “escapes in a boat.”  Each new\nworld is an exact counterpart of the one destroyed, and each Menu\nis a representation of all preceding ones.  Thus the history of\none dynasty serves for all the rest.  This doctrine of a\ntriplicated Deity appearing at the beginning of a new creation\nmay be traced in nearly every country of the globe.  Among the\nBuddhists of China, Fo is mysteriously multiplied into three\npersons in the same manner as is Fo-hi, who is evidently Noah. \nAmong the Hindoos is observed the triad Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva\nspringing from the monad Brahm or Brahme.  This triad appears on\nthe earth at the beginning of each Manwantara in the human form\nof Menu and his three sons.  We are assured that among the\nTartars evident traces are found of a similar God, who is seated\non the lotus.  It is also figured on a Siberian medal in the\nimperial collection at St. Petersburg.  The Jakuthi Tartars, who\nare said to be the most numerous people of Siberia, worship a\ntriplicated Deity under the three denominations of Artugon and\nSchugo-tangon and Tangara.  Faber tells us that this Tartar God\nis the same even in appellation with the Tanga-tanga of the\nPeruvians, who, like other tribes of America, seem plainly to\nhave crossed over from the North-eastern extremity of Siberia. \nUpon this subject the same writer remarks thus:",
        "“Agreeably to the mystical notion so familiar to the Hindoos,\nthat the self-triplicated Great Father yet remained but one in\nessence, the Peruvians supposed their Tanga-tanga to be one in\nthree, and three in one: and in consequence of the union of hero\nworship with the astronomical and material systems of idolatry\nthey venerated the sun and the air, each under three images and\nthree names.  The same opinions equally prevailed throughout the\nnations which lie to the west of Hindostan.  Thus the Persians\nhad their Ormuzd, Mithras, and Ahriman: or, as the matter was\nsometimes represented, their self-triplicating Mithras.  The\nSyrians had their Monimus, Aziz, and Ares.  The Egyptians had\ntheir Emeph, Eicton, and Phtha.  The Greeks and Romans had their\nJupiter, Neptune, and Pluto; three in number, though one in\nessence, and all springing from Cronus, a fourth, yet older God. \nThe Canaanites had their Baal-Spalisha or self-triplicated Baal. \nThe Goths had their Odin, Vile, and Ve, who are described as the\nthree sons of Bura, the offspring of the mysterious cow, and the\nCelts had their three bulls, venerated as the living symbols of\nthe triple Hu or Menu.  To the same class we must ascribe the\ntriads of the Orphic and Pythagorean and Platonic schools; each\nof which must again be identified with the imperial triad of the\nold Chaldaic or Babylonian philosophy.\"[43]",

Of the catastrophes which from time to time have\nvisited our planet, and of the belief which has come to be\nentertained by ecclesiastics that the earth will be destroyed by\nfire, Celsus writes:",

The doctrine of a triplicated\nGod saved from destruction by a storm-tossed ark which rested on\nsome local mountain answering to Ararat, and which was filled\nwith the natural elements of reproduction, is found amongst the\ntraditions of every country of the globe.  In Egypt, the\ndestructive agency drives the God into the ark–or into the\nfish’s belly, where he is obliged to remain until the flood\nsubsides.  In other words, at the time of the destruction of the\nworld, the creative agency is forced within the womb of Nature,\nthere to remain until it again comes forth to recreate the world;\nnor does the symbolism end here, for this God–the sun, or the\nreproductive power within it, which every year is put to death by\nthe cold of winter, must for a season remain lifeless, but, at\nthe proper time, will come forth with healing in his wings.  This\nGod must issue forth to life through female Nature.",

In one sense he represents a\nSavior, in another sense he is the saved, for he is the seed of a\nformer world and is born again from a boat, a symbol which always\nrepresents the female energy.  Sometimes he is shut up in a\nwooden cow, from which he issues forth to new life.  Again this\nstorm tossed mariner is born from a cave, or the door of a rocky\ncavern, within which he had been preserved from some terrible\ncatastrophe, caused either by water or fire.",
        "Sir W. Jones, Faber, Higgins, and many others who have\ninvestigated this subject are confident that the Noah of Genesis\nis identical with Menu, the law-giver of India, and that both are\nAdam, a man who appears with his three sons at the end of each\ncycle, or six hundred years, to renovate the world.  In the six\nhundred and first year of Noah’s life, in the first month, on the\nfirst day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. \nThe drying of the waters, and the beginning anew just at the\nclose of the six hundred years, are thought to refer to the end\nof the cycle of the Neros.  A year of Menu or Buddha had expired\nand a new dynasty or Mamwantara was to begin.",

        "“Brahm then at the head of the Indian triad is Menu at the head\nof his three sons.  But that by the first Menu we are to\nunderstand Adam, is evident, both from the remarkable\ncircumstance of himself and his consort bearing the titles of\nAdima and Iva, and from the no less remarkable tradition that one\nof his three sons was murdered by his brother at a sacrifice. \nHence it will follow, that Brahm at the head of the Indian triad\nis Adam at the head of his three sons, Cain, Abel, and Seth. \nEach Menu with his triple offspring is only the reappearance of a\nformer Menu with his triple offspring; for, in every such\nmanifestation at the commencement of each Mamwantara, the Hindoo\nTrimurti, or triad, becomes incarnate, by transmigrating from the\nhuman bodies occupied during a former incarnation; Brahm or the\nUnity appearing as the paternal Menu of a new age, while the\ntriad, Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, is exhibited in the person of\nhis three sons.  .  .  .  But the ark-preserved Menu–Satyavrata\nand his three sons are certainly Noah and his three sons, Shem,\nHam, and Japhet.”",
        "Hesiod teaches that, after the flood, Chaos, Night, and black\nErebus first appeared.[45] At this time, when there was no Earth,\nno Heaven, and no Air, an egg floated on the face of the deep,\nwhich, being parted, brought forth Love, or Cupid.  Out of Chaos\nthis God created or formed all things.  Now Cupid is the same as\nthe Greek Phanes, and Phanes is Noah, the egg being the ark or\nfemale principle from which he was produced.  The Greek God\nPhanes is the same as the Egyptian Osiris, who was driven into\nthe ark by the “wind that blasts,” or by the evil principle.",
        "[45] The Theogony.",
        "“As Cupid is indifferently said to have been produced from an egg\nat a time when the whole world was in disorder, and from the womb\nof the marine goddess Venus, the egg and the womb of that goddess\nmust denote the same thing.  Accordingly we shall find that, on\nthe one hand, Venus is immediately connected with the symbolical\negg; and, on the other hand, that she is identical with Derceto\nand Isis, and is declared to be that general receptacle out of\nwhich all the hero-gods were produced.  Now there can be little\ndoubt in what sense we are to understand this expression, when we\nare told that the peculiar symbol of Isis was a ship; and when we\nlearn that the form assumed at the period of the deluge, by the\nIndian Isi or Bhavani, who is clearly the same as the Egyptian\nIsis, was the ship Argha, in which her consort Siva floated\nsecurely on the surface of the ocean.  Venus, therefore, or the\nGreat Mother, the parent of Cupid from whom all mankind\ndescended, must be the Ark: consequently, the egg, with which she\nis connected, must be the Ark also.  Aristophanes informs us that\nthe egg out of which Love was born, was produced by Night in the\nbosom of Erebus.  But the Goddess Night, as we learn from the\nOrphic poet, was the very same person as Venus; and he celebrates\nher as the parent of the Universe, and as the general mother both\nof the hero-gods and of man.  The egg therefore produced by Night\nwas produced by Venus: but Venus and the egg meant the same\nthing: even that vast floating machine, which was esteemed an\nepitome of the world, and from which was born that Deity who is\nalso literally said to have been set afloat in an ark.  Sometimes\nthe order of production was inverted; and, instead of the egg\nbeing produced by Night or Venus, Venus herself was fabled to\nhave been produced from the egg.  There is a remarkable legend of\nthis sort which ascribes Venus and her egg to the age of Typhon\nand Osiris, in other words, to the age in which Noah was\ncompelled by the deluge to enter into the ark.\"[46]",

        "The Preserver of the Persians, who is seated on a rainbow in\nfront of their rock temples, is Mithras, who is identical with\nNoah.  Sometimes this ancient mariner is represented as riding on\nthe back of a fish, and again as floating in a boat.  The God of\nHindostan, like the classical Dionysos, was enclosed in an ark\nand driven into the sea.  According to the Gothic traditions as\nrecorded in the Eddas, there once existed a beautiful world,\nwhich was destroyed by fire.  Another was created, which, with\nall its inhabitants save a giant and his three sons, who were\nsaved in a ship, were destroyed by water.  With this triad, which\noriginally sprang from a mysterious cow, the new world began. \nThis new world, which represents the present system, will in time\nbe devoured by flames; but another earth will arise from the\nocean,–an earth far more beautiful than this, upon which all\nkinds of grain and delicious fruits will grow without\ncultivation.  Veda and Vile will be there, for the conflagration\nwill have been powerless to destroy them.  While the flames are\ndevouring all things, two human beings, a female and a male, will\nbe concealed under a hill, where they will feed upon dew, and\nwill propagate so abundantly that the earth will soon be peopled\nwith a new race of beings.  During the catastrophe, the sun will\nbe devoured by a wolf, but before her death she will give birth\nto a daughter as resplendent as herself, who will go in the same\npath formerly trodden by her mother.",
        "The doctrines of the Gothic philosophers, as they appear in the\nEddas, concerning the eternity of matter, the renewal or\nsuccession of worlds, and reincarnation are the same as those\ntaught by Pythagoras, the Stoics, and other Greek schools of\nthought.",
        "Brahme or Vishnu, resting on the bottom of the sea–a goddess\nwho was symbolized by the self-generating lotus–was in later\nages the mysterious Cow of the Goths.",
        "After the natural truths concealed beneath their religious\nsymbolism were wholly forgotten, and human nature through the\nover-stimulation of the animal instincts had become corrupted,\nAdam and Eve, names which doubtless for ages represented the two\nfecundating principles throughout Nature, with their sons, Cain,\nAbel, and Seth, comprehended the god-idea.  The fact has been\nobserved that just six hundred years from the creation of Adam,\nor at the close of the cycle, Noah appears with his three sons to\nsave or perpetuate the race.",
        "It is now believed that this account of Noah and his three sons\nis an allegory beneath which are concealed the religious\ndoctrines, or perhaps I should say, the philosophical\nspeculations of an older race.  The God of the ancients was\nidentified with the life of man individually and with that of\nmankind collectively.  As men die each day, and as every day men\nare born, this Deity is said to die and to be renewed each day;\nand as he is the sun, or the incarnation of the sun, the rising\nand setting of this luminary depict the constantly dying and\nregenerating God of Nature, the same as do the changing seasons. \nA similar idea reappears in their system of the renewal of worlds\nand reincarnation.",
        "Regarding the doctrine of the eternity of matter held by the\nancients, Origen mentions a belief of the Egyptians that the",
        "“world or its substance was never produced, but that it has\nexisted from all eternity.  Neither is there any such thing as\ndeath.  Those who perish about us every day are simply changed,\neither they take on other forms or are removed to some other\nplace.  God cannot be destroyed, and as all things are parts of\nthe Deity everything lives and has always lived, seeming death\nbeing simply change.  Remnants of these doctrines are found in\nevery portion of the globe; among the Mexicans of the west as\nwell as among the rude mountaineers of the Burman Empire.”",
        "While contemplating the philosophical speculations of an ancient\nrace Bailly gave expression to the belief, that a “profoundly\nlearned race of people existed previous to the formation of any\nof our systems.”  The wiser among the Greek philosophers, those\nwho, it is believed, borrowed their philosophical doctrines from\nthe East, declare that “there is no production of anything which\nwas not before; no new substance made which did not really\npre-exist.”  Equally with matter was spirit indestructible.  “Our\nsoul,” says Plato, “was somewhere, before it came to exist in\nthis present form; whence it appears to be immortal.  .  .  . \nWho knows whether that which is demonstrated living, be not\nindeed rather dying, and whether that which is styled dying be\nnot rather living?”",
        "To one who has given attention to the various legends relative to\nthe destruction of the world by a flood, and a storm-tossed\nmariner saved in an ark or boat, it is plain that they all have\nthe same significance, all are but different versions of the same\nmyth, which in an early age was used to conceal the philosophical\ndoctrines of an ancient people.",
        "That the early historic nations understood little concerning the\norigin and true meaning of the legends which they had inherited\nfrom an older race is quite evident.  The ignorance of the Greeks\nregarding the significance of these legends is shown by the\nfollowing: When Solon, wishing to acquaint himself with the\nhistory of the oldest times, inquired of an Egyptian priest\nconcerning the time of the flood, and the age of Deucalion or\nPhroneous or Noah, this functionary replied:",
        "“O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children, nor is there an\nold man among you!  Having no ancient traditions nor any\nacquaintance with chronology, you are as yet in a state of\nintellectual infancy.  The true origin of such mutilated fables\nas you possess is this.  There have been and shall again be in\nthe course of many revolving ages, numerous destructions of the\nhuman race; the greatest of them by fire and water, but others in\nan almost endless succession of shorter intervals.\"[47]",
        "[47] Quoted by Plato; also by Clement of Alexandria.",
        "We have observed that the symbol of the universe was an egg.  The\negg was also the symbol of the earth and of the ark, which meant\nuniversal womanhood.  From the mundane egg the triplicated Deity\nsprang.  There can be little doubt at the present time that Adam,\nNoah, Menu, Osiris, and Dionysos all represent the fructifying\npower of the sun.  In process of time they each came to figure as\nmale reproductive energy, and during certain periods of the\nearth’s history they have each in turn been worshipped as the\nDeity.  That not only the ark was female, but that the god\nelement or reproductive principle within the ark was both female\nand male, is a fact which has been lost sight of during the\nhistoric period, or during those ages of the world in which the\nattempt has been made to prove Nature motherless.",
        "All the germs and living creatures which were within the ark, and\nwhich were to reanimate the earth, were in pairs, females and\nmales; and, besides, the Dove (female), the emblem of peace, was\nalso present.  Even Noah himself was produced from an egg, which,\nas we have seen, is the symbol of Venus, or universal womanhood. \nIn after ages the female principle was not mentioned, but, on the\ncontrary, was concealed beneath convenient symbols; and as the\nphilosophical ideas underlying natural religion were lost or\nforgotten, and mankind had become too ignorant to perceive that a\ndual force, female and male which was also a Trinity, pervades\nNature, the notion came gradually to prevail that the creative\nagency, which is spirit, is altogether male.  Hence the\nformulation of the inconceivable doctrine of a Trinity composed\nof a Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.",
        "Glimpses of antiquity as far back as human ken can reach reveal\nthe fact that in early ages of human society the physiological\nquestion of sex was a theme of the utmost importance, while\nvarious proofs are at hand showing that throughout the past the\nquestion of the relative importance of the female and male\nelements in procreation has been a fruitful source of religious\ncontention and strife.  These struggles, which from time to time\ninvolved the entire habitable globe, were of long duration,\nsubsiding only after the adherents of the one sex or the other\nhad gained sufficient ascendancy over the opposite party to\nsuccessfully erect its altars and compel the worship of its own\npeculiar gods, which worship usually included a large share of\nthe temporal power.  Only since the male sex has gained\nsufficient influence to control not only human action, but human\nthought as well, have these contentions subsided.[48]",
        "[48] At the present time, through causes which are not difficult\nto understand, the question of the relative importance of the two\nsexes is again assuming a degree of importance indicative of the\nchanges which are taking place in human thought, and for the\nreason that we are just witnessing the dawn of an intellectual\nage, the problems to be solved will admit of no answers other\nthan those based upon a scientific foundation.",
        "That religious wars have not been confined to more modern times,\nand that among an early race the attempt to exalt the male\nprinciple met with obstinate resistance which involved mankind in\na conflict, the violence of which has never been exceeded, are\nfacts which seem altogether probable.  Indeed, there is much\nevidence going to show that the cause of the original dispersion\nof a primitive race was the contention which arose respecting\ntheir religious faith or regarding the physiological question of\nthe relative importance of the sexes in the function of\nreproduction; and that the general war indicated in the Puranas,\nwhich began in India and extended over the entire habitable\nglobe, and which was celebrated by the poets as “the basis of\nGrecian mythology,” originated in this conflict over the\nprecedence of one or the other of the sex-principles contained in\nthe Deity.  Although there are no records of these wars in extant\nhistory, accounts of them are still preserved in the traditions\nand religious monuments of oriental countries.  In Egypt, in\nIndia, and to a greater or less extent in other Eastern\ncountries, these physiological contests have been disguised under\na veil of allegory, the true significance of which it is no\nlonger difficult to understand.  With the light which more recent\ninvestigation has thrown upon the subject of the separation of\nthe original sex-elements contained in the Deity, the\nsignificance of the following legend in the Servarasa is at once\napparent.",
        "When Parvati (Devi) was united in marriage to Mahadeva (Siva),\nthe divine pair had once a dispute on the comparative influence\nof the sexes in producing animated beings, and each resolved by\nmutual agreement to create a new race of men.  The race produced\nby Mahadeva were very numerous, and devoted themselves\nexclusively to the worship of the male Deity, but their\nintellects were dull, their bodies feeble, their limbs distorted,\nand their complexions of many different hues.  Parvati had at the\nsame time created a multitude of human beings, who adored the\nfemale power only, and were well shaped, with sweet aspects and\nfine complexions.  A furious contest ensued between the two\nnations, and the Lingajas, or adorers of the male principle, were\ndefeated in battle, but Mahadeva, enraged against the Yonigas\n(the worshippers of the female element), would have destroyed\nthem with the fire of his eye if Parvati had not interposed and\nappeased him, but he would spare them only on condition that they\nshould instantly leave the country with a promise to see it no\nmore, and from the Yoni, which they adored as the sole cause of\ntheir existence, they were named Yavanas.",
        "The fact has been noticed in a previous work[49] that, according\nto Wilford, the Greeks were the descendants of the Yavanas of\nIndia, and that when the Ionians emigrated they adopted the name\nto distinguish themselves as adorers of the female, in opposition\nto a strong sect of male worshippers which had been driven from\nthe mother country.  We are taught by the Puranas that they\nsettled partly on the borders of Varaha-Dwip, or Europe, where\nthey became the progenitors of the Greeks; and partly in the two\nDwipas of Cusha, Asiatic and African.  In the Asiatic Cusha-Dwip\nthey supported themselves by violence and rapine.  Parvati,\nhowever, or their tutelary goddess, Yoni, always protected them;\nand at length, in the fine country which they occupied, they\nbecame a flourishing nation.[50] Wilford relates that there is a\nsect of Hindoos who, attempting to reconcile the two systems,\ndeclare in their allegorical style that “Parvati and Mahadeva\nfound their concurrence essential to the perfection of their\noffspring, and that Vishnu, at the request of the goddess,\neffected a reconciliation between them.\"[51]",

        "The people who were dominant in Asia long before the rise of the\nlate Assyrian monarchy, are said to be those whom scriptural\nwriters represent as Cushim, and the Hindoos as Cushas.  They\nwere the descendants of Cush, or Cuth, and were believed to have\nbeen the architects of the Tower of Babel.  Epiphanius, Eusebius,\nand others assert that at the time of the building of this tower\nthere existed two rival beliefs, the one demonstrated as\nScuthism, the other as Ionism, or Hellenism, the latter of which\nembodied the worship of the Great Mother, or the female element,\nwhich was worshipped in the shape of the mystic “Iona or Dove.” \nThe Scuths, on the other hand, believed in the pre-eminence of a\nGreat Father, or, perhaps I should say, in a Deity composed of a\ntriad containing the elements of a male  parent.  Upon this\nsubject the learned Faber remarks: “I am much mistaken if some\ndissension on these points did not prevail at Babel itself; and I\nthink there is reason for believing that the altercation between\nthe rival sects aided the confusion of languages in producing the\ndispersion.\"[52]",

        "Those who believed in the superiority of the male in the\nprocesses of reproduction, adored the male element in the Deity,\nwhile those who held that the female is the more important,\nworshipped the female energy throughout Nature under one or\nanother of its symbols, sometimes as a woman with her child and\nsometimes as a dove, but oftener as an ark, box, or chest.",
        "It is evident from the sacred writings of the Hindoos that in\nIndia, during a period of several thousand years, there existed\nvarious sects, those who worshipped the male as the only creative\nforce, others who adored the female as the origin of life, and\nthose who paid homage to both, as alike important in the office\nof reproduction.",
        "It would seem that the fierce wars which had devastated the land\nhad ceased prior to the beginning of the Tower of Babel. \nAccording to the testimony of Moses, the Lord himself declared\n\"Behold the people is one.”  This unanimity of belief, as is\nplainly shown, was of short duration, for the Tower arose\n\"upright and defiant,” not, however, as an emblem of the primeval\ndual or triune God in which the female energy was predominant,\nbut as a symbol of male creative power.  It was the type of\nvirility which in the subsequent history of religion was to\nassume the position of the “one only and true God.”",
        "It is not improbable that idolatry began with the Tower of Babel.",
        "Indeed it has been confidently asserted by certain writers that\nthe earliest idols set up as emblems of the Deity, or as\nexpressions of the peculiar worship of the Lingajas, were\nobelisks, columns, or towers, the first of which we have any\naccount being the Tower of Babel, erected probably at Nipur in\nChaldea.  Until a comparatively recent time, the actual\nsignificance of this monument seems to have been little\nunderstood.  Later research, however, points to the fact that it\nwas a phallic device erected in opposition to a religion which\nrecognized the female element throughout Nature as God.  The\nlength of time which the adherents of these two doctrines had\ncontended for the mastery is not known, but through the\ndeciphered monuments of ancient nations, by facts gathered from\ntheir sacred writings, and by the general voice of tradition, it\nhas been ascertained with a considerable degree of certainty that\nthis great upheaval of society was the culmination of a dispute\nwhich had long been waged between two contending powers, and\nwhich finally resulted in a separation of the people, and in the\nfinal success, for the time being, of the sect which refused\nlonger to recognize the superior importance of the female in the\ngod-idea.",
        "At what time in the history of mankind the Tower of Babel was\nerected has not been ascertained, but the great antiquity of\nChaldea is no longer questioned.  Sir Henry Rawlinson, in the\nRoyal Geographical Journal says:",

        "Although at the time of the building of the Tower of Babel the\nworship of a Deity in which the male principle was pre-eminent\nhad not become universal, still the facts seem to indicate that\nthe doctrine of male superiority which for ages had been steadily\nadvancing had at length gained the ascendancy over the older\nreligion.  The new faith and worship had corrupted the old, and\nthrough the conditions which had been imposed upon women, and the\nconsequent stimulation of the lower nature in man, even the\nadherents of the older faith were losing sight of those higher\nprinciples which in preceding ages they had adored as God.",
        "We have seen that in every country upon the earth there is a\ntradition recounting the ravages of a flood.  Whether or not this\nlegend is to be traced to an actual calamity by which a large\nportion of Asia was inundated, is not for a certainty known; but\nthe fact that there was a deluge of contention and strife,\nsurpassing anything perhaps which the world has ever witnessed,\nseems altogether probable.",
        "Not long after the catastrophe designated as the flood, emblems\nof the Deity, representations of the male and female elements,\nappear in profusion.  Babylon, at which place was erected the\nTower of Belus, and Memphis, which contained the Pyramids, were\namong the first cities which were built.  As the tower typified\nthe Deity worshipped by those who claimed superiority for the\nmale, so the pyramids symbolized the creative agency and peculiar\nqualities of the female, or of the dual Deity which was\nworshipped as female.",
        "Although the grosser elements in human nature were rapidly\nassuming a more intensely aggressive attitude, and although the\nhigher principles involved in an earlier religion were in a\nmeasure forgotten, it is evident that at this time humanity had\nnot become wholly sensualized, and that the lower propensities\nand appetites had not assumed dominion over the reasoning\nfaculties.",
        "The Great Mother Cybele, who is represented by the Sphinx, had\ndoubtless been adored as a pure abstraction, her worship being\nthat of the universal female principle in Nature.  She is\npictured as the “Eldest Daughter of the Mythologies,” and as “The\nGreat First Cause.”  She represented the past and the future. \nShe was the source whence all that was and is had proceeded.",
        "In its earliest representations, the Sphinx is figured with the\nhead of a woman and the body of a lion.  By various writers it is\nstated that the Sphinxes which were brought as spoils from Asia,\nthe very cradle of religion, were thus represented.  The lion,\nwhich symbolizes royal power and intellectual strength, is always\nattached to the chariot of Cybele.  The Sphinx is supposed to\ntypify not only Cybele, but the great androgynous God of Africa\nas well.  However, as Cybele and Muth portrayed the same idea,\nnamely, female power and wisdom, we are not surprised that they\nshould have been worshipped under the same emblem.  Neither is it\nremarkable, when we recall the fact that the female was supposed\nto comprehend both sexes, that in certain instances a beard\nappears as an accompanying feature of the Sphinx.  We are told\nthat the fourth avatar of Vishnu was a Sphinx, but a further\nsearch into the history of this Deity reveals the fact that her\nninth avatar is Brahm (masculine).  The female principle has at\nlength succumbed to the predominance of male power, and Vishnu\nherself has become transformed into a male God.",
        "Although the rites connected with the worship of Cybele were\nphallic they were absolutely pure.  In an allusion to this\nworship, Hargrave Jennings admits that the “spirituality to which\nwomen in that age of the world were observed to be more liable\nthan men was peculiarly adverse to all sensual indulgence, and\nespecially that of the sexes.”",
        "Although the creative principle was adored under its\nrepresentatives, the Yoni and the Lingham, still the principal\nobject seems to have been, when administering the rites\npertaining to the worship of Cybele, to ignore sex and the usual\nsex distinctions; hence we find that, in order to assume an\nandrogynous appearance, the priestesses of this Goddess\nofficiated in the costumes of males, while priests appeared in\nthe dress peculiar to females.  However, that the sensuous\nelement was to a certain extent already assuming dominion over\nthe higher nature, and that priests were regarded as being\nincapable of self-control, is observed in the fact that in the\nlater ages of female worship one of the principal requirements of\na priest of Cybele was castration.",
        "It is the opinion of Grote that the story which appears in the\nHesiodic Theogony, of the castration of Saturn and Uranus by\ntheir sons with sickles forged by the mother, was borrowed from\nthe Phrygians, or from the worship of the Great Mother.",
        "In India, the strictest chastity was prescribed to the priests of\nSiva, a God which was worshipped as the Destroyer or Regenerator,\nand which in its earlier conception was the same as the Great\nMother Cybele.  These priests were frequently obliged to\nofficiate in a nude state, and during the ceremony should it\nappear that the symbols with which they came in contact had\nappealed to other than their highest emotions, they were\nimmediately stoned by the people.[54]",

Wilford, in his\ndissertations upon Egypt and the Nile, says that in a\nconversation which he had with some learned Brahmins, upon\ndescribing to them the form and peculiarities of the Great\nPyramid, they told him that “it was a temple appropriated to the\nworship of Padma Devi.”  The true Coptic name of these edifices\nis Pire Honc, which signifies a sunbeam.  Padma Devi means the\nlotus, or the Deity of generation.",
        "It is thought by many writers that these gigantic structures were\nerected by the Cushite conquerors of Egypt, who invaded and\ncivilized the country, as emblems of the female Deity whom they\nworshipped.  Certainly the magnitude of these monuments and the\ningenuity displayed in their construction indicate the\nintelligence of their builders and the exalted character of the\nDeity adored.  The Great Pyramid is in the form of a square, each\nside of whose base is seven hundred and fifty-five feet, and\ncovers an area of nearly fourteen acres.  An able writer in\ndescribing the pyramids says that the first thing which impresses\none is the uniform precision and systematic design apparent in\ntheir architecture.  They all have their sides accurately adapted\nto the four cardinal points.",

Their obliquity\nbeing so adjusted as to make the north side coincide with the\nobliquity of the sun’s rays at the summer’s solstice, has,\ncombined with the former particulars, led some to suppose they\nwere solely intended for astronomical uses; and certainly, if not\naltogether true, it bespeaks, at all events, an intimate\nacquaintance with astronomical rules, as well as a due regard to\nthe principles of geometry.  Others have fancied them intended\nfor sepulchres; and as the Egyptians, taught by their ancient\nChaldean victors, connected astronomy with their funereal and\nreligious ceremonies, they seem in this to be not far astray, if\nwe but extend the application to their sacred bulls and other\nanimals, and not merely to their kings, as Herodotus would have\nus suppose.\"[55]",

With its base upwards it\ntypifies the Delta, or the door through which all come into the\nworld.  With its apex uppermost, it is an emblem of the phallic\ntriad.

The attempt to solve the great\nproblem of the origin of life on the earth led these people to\ncontemplate with the profoundest reverence all the visible\nobjects which were believed to affect human destiny.  Hence both\nthe pyramid and the tower served a double purpose, first, as\nemblems of the Deity worshipped, and, second, as monuments for\nthe study of the heavenly bodies with which their religious ideas\nwere so intimately connected.",

        "From the time when the two religious elements began to separate\nin the minds of the people, the prophets, seers, and priestesses\nof the old religion, those who continued to worship the Virgin\nand Child, had prophesied that a mortal woman, a virgin, would,\nindependently of the male principle, bring forth a child, the\nfulfilment of which prophecy would vindicate the ancient faith\nand forever settle the dispute relative to the superiority of the\nfemale in the office of reproduction.  Thus would the woman\n\"bruise the serpent’s head.”  In process of time not only\nYonigas, but Lingajas as well, came to accept the doctrine of the\nincarnation of the sun in the bodies of earthly virgins.  By\nLingaites, however, it was the seed of the woman and not the\nwoman herself who was to conquer evil.  Finally, with the\nincreasing importance of the male in human society, it is\nobserved that a reconciliation has been effected between the\nfemale worshippers and those of the male.  Athene herself has\nacquiesced in the doctrine of male superiority.",
        "Thalat, the great Chaldean Deity, who presided over Chaos prior\nto the existence of organized matter, is finally transformed into\na male God.  The Hindoo Vishnu, who as she slept on the bottom of\nthe sea brought forth all creation, has changed her sex.  Brahm,\nthe Creator, is male, and appears as a triplicated Deity in the\nform of three sons within whom is contained the essence of a\nGreat Father, the female creative principle being closely veiled.",
        "Hence we see that the God of the ancients, the universal dual\nforce which resides in the sun and which creates all things, is\nno longer worshipped under the figure of a mother and her child. \nAlthough the female principle is still a necessary factor in the\ncreative processes, and although it is capable of producing gods,\nthe mother element possesses none of the essentials which\nconstitute a Deity.  In other words, woman is not a Creator. \nFrom the father is derived the soul of the child, while from the\nmother, or from matter, the body is formed.  Hence the prevalence\nat a certain stage of human history of divine fathers and earthly\nmothers; for instance, Alexander of Macedon, Julius Caesar, and\nlater the mythical Christ who superseded Jesus, the Judean\nphilosopher and teacher of mankind.",
        "Henceforth, caves, wells, cows, boxes and chests, arks, etc.,\nstand for or symbolize the female power.  We are given to\nunderstand, however, that for ages these symbols were as holy as\nthe God himself, and among many peoples even more revered and\nworshipped.",
        "We have seen that the ancients knew that matter and force were\nalike indestructible.  According to their doctrine all Nature\nproceeded from the sun.  Hence the power back of the sun, which\nthey worshipped as the Destroyer or Regenerator, or, in other\nwords, as the mother of the sun, was the Great Aum or Om, the\nAleim or Elohim, who was the indivisible God.  The creative\nagency which proceeded from the sun was both male and female, yet\none in essence.  Later, the male appeared as spirit, the female\nas matter.  Spirit was something above and independent of Nature.",
        "It had indeed created matter from nothing.  The fact will be\nremembered that man claimed supremacy over woman on the ground\nthat the male is spirit, while the female is only matter; in\nother words, that she was simply a covering for the soul, which\nis divine.",
        "Thus was the god-idea divorced from Nature, and a masculine\nprinciple, outside and independent of matter, set up as a\npersonal potentate or ruler over the universe.",
        "The logic by which the great female principle in the Deity has\nbeen eliminated, and the subterfuges which have been and still\nare employed to construct and sustain a Creator who of himself is\npowerless to create, is as amusing as it is suggestive, and\nforcibly recalls to mind la couvade, in which, among certain\ntribes, the father, assuming all the duties of procreation, goes\nto bed when a child is born.[59]",

        "All mythologies prove conclusively that ages elapsed before human\nbeings were rash enough, or sufficiently blinded by falsehood and\nsuperstition, to attempt to construct a creative force unaided by\nthe female principle.  Just here it may not be out of place to\nrefer to the fact that in the attempt to divorce God from Nature\nhave arisen all the superstitions and senseless religious\ntheories with which, since the earliest ages of metaphysical\nspeculation, the human mind has been crowded.",
        "To this separation of the two original elements in the Deity, and\nthe consequent exaltation of one of the factors in the creative\nprocesses, is to be traced the beginning of our present false,\nunnatural, and unphilosophical masculine system of religion–a\nsystem under which a father appears as the sole parent of the\nuniverse.",
        "The fact is tolerably well understood that mysticism and the\naccumulation of superstitious ideas are the result of the\nover-stimulation of the lower animal instincts.  When the\nagencies which had hitherto held the lower nature in check became\ninoperative–when man began to regard himself as a Creator and\ntherefore as the superior of woman–he had reached a point at\nwhich he was largely controlled by supernatural or mystical\ninfluences.",
        "The fact is observed that in course of time the governmental\npowers are no longer in the hands of the people; the masses have\nbecome enslaved.  Their rulers are priests–deified tyrants who\nare unable to maintain their authority except through the\nignorance and credulity of the masses.  Hence one is not\nsurprised to find that the change which took place at a certain\nstage of human growth in respect to the manner of reckoning\ndescent was instigated and enforced by religion.  Apollo had\ndeclared that woman is but the nurse to her own offspring. \nNeither is it remarkable at this stage in the human career, as\nwomen had lost their position as heads of families, and as they\nwere no longer recognized as of kin to their children, that man\nshould have attempted to lessen the importance of the female\nelement in the god-idea.",
        "Wherever in the history of the human race we observe a change in\nthe relations of the sexes involving greater or more oppressive\nrestrictions on the natural rights of women, such change, whether\nit assume a legal, social, or religious form, will, if traced to\nits source, always be found deeply rooted in the wiles of\npriestcraft.  Since the decay of the earliest form of religion,\nnamely, Nature-worship, the gods have never been found ranged on\nthe side of women.",
        "Later investigations are proving that the primitive idea of a\nDeity had its foundation in actual physical facts and\nexperiences; and, as the maternal principle constituted the most\nimportant as well as the most obvious of the facts which entered\ninto the conception of a Creator, and as it was the only natural\nbond capable of binding human society together, so long as reason\nwas not wholly clouded by superstition and warped by sensuality,\nit could not be eliminated.  In other words, a Creator in which\nthe more essential element of creative force was wanting, was\ncontrary to all human experience and observation.  Indeed nothing\ncould be plainer than that the deified male principle could of\nitself create nothing, and that it was dependent for its very\nexistence on the female element.",
        "By this attempt to construct a masculine Deity, absurdities were\npresented to the human judgment and understanding which for ages\ncould not be overcome, and by it contradictions were necessitated\nwhich could not be reconciled with human reason and with the\nideas of Nature which had hitherto been held by mankind.  It was\nnot, therefore, until reason had been suspended in all matters\npertaining to religion, and blind faith in the machinations of\npriestcraft had been established, that a male God was set up as\nthe sole Creator of the universe.",
        "When women, who had become the legitimate plunder not only of\nindividuals but of bands of warriors whose avowed object was the\ncapture of women for wives, had degenerated into mere tools or\ninstruments for the gratification and pleasure of men, Perceptive\nWisdom or Light, and Maternal Affection the Preserver of the\nrace, gradually became eliminated from the god-idea of mankind. \nPassion became God.  It was the Creator in the narrowest and most\nrestricted sense.",
        "Although in an age of pure Nature-worship the ideas connected\nwith reproduction, like those related to all other natural\nfunctions, were wholly unconnected with impurity either of\nthought or deed, still when an age arrived in which all checks to\nhuman passion had been withdrawn, and the lower propensities had\ngained dominion over the higher faculties, the influence of\nfertility or passion-worship on human development or growth may\nin a degree be imagined.",
        "The fact must be borne in mind that curing the later ages of\npassion-worship the creative processes and the reproductive\norgans were deified, not as an expression or symbol of the\noperations of Nature, but as a means to the stimulation of the\nlower animal instincts in man.",
        "With religion bestialized and its management regulated wholly\nwith an idea to the gratification of man’s sensuous desires,\nreligious temples, under the supervision of the priesthood,\nbecame brothels, in which were openly practiced as part and\nparcel of religious rites and ceremonies the most wanton\nprofligacy and the most shameless self-abandonment.  The worship\nof Aphrodite or Venus, and also that of Bacchus, originally\nconsisted in homage paid to the reproductive principles contained\nin the earth, water, and sun, but, as is well known, this pure\nand beautiful worship, in later times, and especially after it\nwas carried to Greece, became synonymous with the grossest\npractices and the most lawless disregard of human decency.",
        "With the light which in these later ages science and ethnological\nresearch are throwing upon the physiological and religious\ndisputes of the ancients, the correctness of the primitive\ndoctrines elaborated under purer conditions at an age when human\nbeings lived nearer to Nature is being proved–namely, that\nmatter like spirit is eternal and indestructible, and therefore\nthat the one is as difficult of comprehension as the other, and\nthat Nature, instead of being separated from spirit, is filled\nwith it and can not be divorced from it; also that the female is\nthe original organic unit of creation, without which nothing is\nor can be created.",
        "The profound doctrines of abstractions or emanations; of the\nabsorption of the individual soul into the divine ether or\nessence; of the renewal of worlds and reincarnation, were\ndoubtless elaborated after the separation, in the human mind, of\nSpirit from matter, but before mankind had lost the power to\nreason abstractly.",
        "Although Pythagoras understood and believed these doctrines, he\ndid not, as is well known, receive them from his degenerate\ncountrymen, but, on the contrary, imbibed them from private\nsources among the orientals, where fragments of their remarkable\nlearning were still extant.  He said that religion consists in\nknowing the truth and doing good, and his ideas show the grandeur\nand beauty of the earlier conception of a Deity.  He declared\nthat there is only one God who is not, “as some are apt to\nimagine, seated above the world, beyond the orb of the universe,\"\nbut that this great power is diffused throughout Nature.  It is\n\"the reason, the life, and the motion of all things.”",
        "Plato believed that human beings are possessed of two souls, the\none mortal, which perishes with the body, the other immortal,\nwhich continues to exist either in a state of happiness or\nmisery; that the righteous soul, freed from the limitations of\nmatter, returns at death to the source whence it came, and that\nthe wicked, after having been detained for a while in a place\nprepared for their reception, are sent back to earth to reanimate\nother bodies.",
        "Aristotle held the opinion that the souls of human beings are\nsparks from the divine flame, while Zeno, the founder of the\nStoic philosophy, taught that spirit acting upon matter produced\nthe elements and the earth.  There is plenty of evidence going to\nshow that the early Fathers in the Christian church believed in\nthe doctrines of reincarnation and the renewal of worlds. \nNeither is there any doubt but that this philosophy came from the\nEast, where it originated.  It is thought that the ancient\nphilosophers who elaborated these doctrines were unable to\naccount for the existence of evil without a belief in the\nimmortality of the soul.  Spirit was eternal, as was also matter.",
        "A soul, upon leaving the body, in course of time found its way\nback to earth, surrounded by conditions suited to its stage of\ngrowth.  Here it must reap all the consequences of its former\nlife.  It must also during its stay on earth make the conditions\nfor its next appearance upon an earthly plane.  So soon as\nthrough a succession of births and deaths it had perfected\nitself, it entered into a state of Nirvana.  It was absorbed into\nthe great Universal Soul.  Nothing is ever lost.",

        "“The eternity of matter is a well known tenet of the\nPythagoreans, and whether right or wrong there can be no doubt\nthat it was the doctrine of the oriental school, whence\nPythagoras drew his learning.  It was a principle taken or\nmistaken from, or found amongst, the debris of that mighty mass\nof learning and science of a former period, of which, on looking\nback as far as human ken can reach, the most learned men have\nthought that they could see a faint glimmering.  Indeed, I think\nI may say something more than a faint glimmering.  For all the\nreally valuable moral and philosophical doctrines we possess,\nDutens has shown to have existed there.”",
        "From what is known relative to the speculations of an ancient\nrace, the fact is observed that creation was but a re-formation\nof matter.  Wisdom, or Minerva, formed the earth and the planets;\nshe did not create the heavens and the earth, as did the later\nJewish God.",
        "Of the seven principles of the universe, matter was the first,\nand of the seven principles of man, the physical body was the\nearliest.  Through evolutionary processes, or through cyclic\nperiods involving millions of years, mind was developed, and in\ncourse of time spirit was finally manifested.",
        "Mai, the Mother of Gotama Buddha, was simply matter, or illusion,\nfrom which its higher manifestation, mind or spirit, was\nemerging.  She was also the mother of Mercury.  A clearer\nknowledge of the philosophical doctrines which were elaborated at\na time when Nature-worship was beginning to decay, reveals the\nfact that the god-idea comprehended a profound knowledge of\nNature and her laws; that while this people did not pretend to\naccount for the existence of matter, they recognized a force\noperating through it whose laws were unchanged and unchanging.",
        "With these facts relative to the intelligence of an older race\nbefore us, the question naturally arises: What was the degree of\ncivilization attained at a time when the Deity worshipped was an\nabstract principle involving the actual creative processes\nthroughout Nature? and, notwithstanding our prejudices, we are\nconstrained to acknowledge that these earlier conceptions are\nscarcely compatible with the barbarism which we have been taught\nto regard as the condition of all the peoples which existed prior\nto the first Greek Olympiad.  On the contrary, the origin of the\nphilosophical opinions entertained by the most ancient oriental\nphilosophers, and which must have arisen out of a profound\nknowledge or appreciation of Nature and her operations, point to\na race far superior to any of those peoples which appear in early\nhistoric times.  Regarding these opinions, Godfrey Higgins\nremarks:",
        "“From their philosophical truth and universal reception I am\nstrongly inclined to refer them to the authors of the Neros, or\nto that enlightened race, supposed by Bailly to have formerly\nexisted, and to have been saved from a great catastrophe on the\nHimalaya Mountains.  This is confirmed by an observation which\nthe reader will make in the sequel, that these doctrines have\nbeen, like all the other doctrines of antiquity, gradually\ncorrupted–incarnated, if I may be permitted to compose a word\nfor the occasion.”",
        "Of this cycle, Bailly says: “No person could have invented the\nNeros who had not arrived at much greater perfection in astronomy\nthan we know was the state of the most ancient Assyrians,\nEgyptians, and Greeks.”",
        "Toward the close of the eighteenth century the celebrated\nastronomer, Bailly, published a work entitled The History of\nAncient Astronomy, in which he endeavored to prove that a nation\npossessed of profound wisdom and great genius, and of an\nantiquity far superior to the Hindoos or Egyptians, “inhabited\nthe country to the north of India, or about fifty degrees north\nlatitude.”  This writer has shown that “the most celebrated\nastronomical observations and inventions, from their peculiar\ncharacter, could have taken place only in these latitudes, and\nthat arts and improvements gradually travelled thence to the\nequator.”",
        "A colony of Brahmins settled near the Imans, and in Northern\nThibet, where in ancient times they established celebrated\ncolleges, particularly at Nagraent and Cashmere.  In these\ninstitutions the treasures of Sanskrit literature were supposed\nto be deposited.  The Rev. Mr. Maurice was informed that an\nimmemorial tradition prevailed at Benares that all the learning\nof India came from a country situated in forty degrees of\nnorthern latitude.  Other writers are of the opinion that\ncivilization proceeded from Arabia; that the old Cushite race\ncarried commerce, letters, and laws to all the nations of the\nEast.  Which of these theories is true, if either, may not with\ncertainty be proved at present; yet that in the far distant past\na race of people existed whose achievements exceeded those of any\nof the historic nations may not be doubted.",
        "That the length of the year was calculated with greater exactness\nby an ancient and forgotten people than it was by early historic\nnations is proved by the cycle of the Neros.  This cycle, which\nwas formed of 7.421 lunar revolutions of 29 days, 12 hours, 44\nminutes, and 3 seconds, or 219,146 days and a half, was equal to\n600 solar years of 365 days, 5 hours, 51 minutes, and 36 seconds,\nwhich time varies less than three minutes from the present\nobservations of the year’s length.  The length of the year as\ncalculated by the Egyptians and other early historic nations was\n360 days, which fact would seem to indicate that a science of\nastronomy had been developed in an earlier age which by the most\nancient peoples of whom we have any historic records has been\nlost or forgotten.  It has been said that if this cycle of the\nNeros “were correct to the second, if on the first of January at\nnoon a new moon took place, it would take place again in exactly\n600 years at the same moment of the day, and under all the same\ncircumstances.\"[61]",

A dodecan consisted of 5 days, and 72 dodecans formed a\nnatural year of 360 days.  According to the earlier calculations,\n360 solar diurnal revolutions constituted a natural year.  The\ndoctrine of the ancients concerning these cycles is thus set\nforth by Godfrey Higgins:",
        "“The sun, or rather that higher principle of which the sun was\nthe emblem or the shekinah, was considered to be incarnated every\nsix hundred years.  Whilst the sun was in Taurus, the different\nincarnations, under whatever names they might go, were all\nconsidered but as incarnations of Buddha or Taurus.  When he got\ninto Aries, they were in like manner considered but as\nincarnations of Cristna or Aries, and even Buddha and Cristna\nwere originally considered the same, and had a thousand names in\ncommon, constantly repeated in their litanies–a striking proof\nof identity of origin.  Of these Zodiacal divisions the Hindoos\nformed another period, which consisted of ten ages or Calpas or\nYugs, which they considered the duration of the world, at the end\nof which a general renovation of all things would take place. \nThey also reckoned ten Neroses to form a period, each of them\nkeeping a certain relative location to the other, and together to\nform a cycle.  To effect this they doubled the precessional\nperiod for one sign– viz: 2160 years–thus making 4320, which\nwas a tenth of 43,200, a year of the sun, analogous to the 360\nnatural days, and produced in the same manner, by multiplying the\nday of 600 by the dodecans 72 = 43,200.  They then formed another\ngreat year of 432,000 by again multiplying it by 10, which they\ncalled a Cali Yug, which was measurable both by the number 2160,\nthe years the equinox preceded in a sign, and by the number 600. \nThey then had the following scheme:",
        "altogether 10 Ages, making a Maha Yug or Great Age.  These were\nall equimultiples of the Cycle of the Neros 600, and of 2160, the\ntwelfth part of the equinoctial precessional Cycle, and in all\nformed ten ages of 432,000 years each.\"[62]",

        "The two great religious festivals of the ancients occurred the\none in the spring, at Easter, when all Nature was renewed, the\nother in the autumn, after the earth had yielded her bounties and\nthe fruits were garnered in.  It was at these gatherings that the\nGreat Mother Earth received the devout adoration of all her\nchildren.",
        "It is supposed that the Neros, or cycle of 600, is closely\nconnected with this worship, and that it was invented to regulate\nthe season for these festivals.  In process of time it was\ndiscovered that this cycle no longer answered, that the festival\nwhich had originally fallen on the first of May now occurred on\nthe first of April.  This, we are told,",
        "“led ultimately to the discovery that the equinox preceded about\n2160 years in each sign or 25,920 years in the 12 signs, and this\ninduced them to try if they could not form a cycle of the two. \nOn examination, they found that the 600 would not commensurate\nthe 2160 years in a sign, or any number of sums of 2160 less than\nten, but that it would with ten, or that in ten times 2160, or in\n21,600 years, the two cycles would agree; yet this artificial\ncycle would not be enough to include the cycle of 25,920.  They,\ntherefore, took two of the periods of 21,600, or 43,200; and,\nmultiplying both by ten–viz: 600 X 10 = 6000, and 43,200 X 10 =\n432,000–they formed a period with which the 600-year period and\nthe 6000-year period would terminate and form a cycle.  Every\n432,000 years the three periods would commence anew; thus the\nthree formed a year or cycle, 72 times 6000 making 432,000, and\n720 times 600 making 432,000.\"[63]",
        "[63] Higgins, Anacalypsis, p. 235.",
        "To form a great year, which would include all the cyclical\nmotions of the sun and moon, and perhaps of the planets, they\nmultiplied 432,000 by ten; thus they had ten periods answering to\nten signs.  Concerning these cycles Godfrey Higgins observes:",
        "“Persons of narrow minds will be astonished at such monstrous\ncycles; but it is very certain that no period could properly be\ncalled the great year unless it embraced in its cycle every\nperiodical movement or apparent aberration.  But their vulgar\nwonder will perhaps cease when they are told that La Place has\nproved that, if the periodical aberrations of the moon be\ncorrectly calculated, the great year must be extended to a\ngreater length even than 4,320,000 years of the Maha Yug of the\nHindoos, and certainly no period can be called a year of our\nplanetary system which does not take in all the periodical\nmotions of the planetary bodies.”",
        "It is thought that as soon as these ancient astronomers perceived\nthat the equinoxes preceded, they would at once attempt to\ndetermine the rate of precession in a given time; the precession,\nhowever, in one year was so small that they were obliged to\nextend their observations over immense periods.  Jones informs us\nthat the Hindoos first supposed that the precession took place at\nthe rate of 60 years in a degree, or 1800 in a Zodiacal sign, and\nof 21,600 in a revolution of the entire circle.  They afterwards\ncame to think that the precession was at the rate of 60 years and\na fraction of a year, and thus that the precession for a sign was\nin 1824 years, and for the circle in 21,888 years.  Subsequently\nthey discovered, or thought they had discovered, the Soli-Lunar\nperiod of 608 years, hence they attempted to make the two go\ntogether.  Both, however, proved to be erroneous.",
        "In referring to the fact that among the ancient Romans existed\nthe story of the twelve vultures and the twelve ages of 120 years\neach, Higgins remarks:",
        "“This arose from the following cause: They came from the East\nbefore the supposition that the precession took place a degree in\nabout 60 years, and 1824 years in a sign had been discovered to\nbe erroneous; and as they supposed the Neros made a correct cycle\nin 608 years, and believed the precessional cycle to be completed\nin 21,888, they of course made their ages into twelve.  As both\nnumbers were erroneous, they would not long answer their intended\npurpose, and their meaning was soon lost, though the sacred\nperiods of twelve ages and of 608 remained.”",
        "According to Hipparchus and Ptolemy, the equinoxes preceded at\nthe rate of a degree in 100 years, or 36,000 hundred years in 360\ndegrees.  This constituted a great year, at the end of which the\nregeneration of all things takes place.  This is thought to be a\nremnant of the most ancient Hindoo speculations, and not the\nresult of observation among the Greeks.  Some time after the\narrival of the sun in Aries,",
        "“at the vernal equinox, the Indians probably discovered their\nmistake, in giving about 60 years to a degree; that they ought to\ngive 50” to a year, about 72 years to a degree, and about 2160\nyears to a sign; and that the Luni-Solar cycle, called the Neros,\ndid not require 608 years, but 600 years only, to complete its\nperiod.  Hence arose the more perfect Neros.”",
        "It is thought by various writers that the knowledge of the\nancient Hindoos regarding the movements of the sun and moon in\ntheir cycles of nineteen and six hundred years–the Metonic\ncycle, and the Neros–proves that long before the birth of\nHipparchus the length of the year was known with a degree of\nexactitude which that astronomer had not the means of\ndetermining.  It is positively asserted by astronomers that at\nleast twelve hundred years were required, “during which time the\nobservations must have been taken with the greatest care and\nregularly recorded,” to arrive at the knowledge necessary for the\ninvention of the Neros, and that such observations would have\nbeen impossible without the aid of the telescope.",
        "On the subject of the great learning of an ancient race, Sir W. \nDrummond says:",
        "“The fact, however, is certain, that at some remote period there\nwere mathematicians and astronomers who knew that the sun is in\nthe centre of the planetary system, and that the earth, itself a\nplanet, revolves round the central fire;–who calculated, or like\nourselves attempted to calculate, the return of comets, and who\nknew that these bodies move in elliptic orbits, immensely\nelongated, having the sun in one of their foci;–who indicated\nthe number of the solar years contained in the great cycle, by\nmultiplying a period (variously called in the Zend, the Sanscrit,\nand the Chinese ven, van, and phen) of 180 years by another\nperiod of 144 years;–who reckoned the sun’s distance from the\nearth at 800,000,000 of Olympic stadia; and who must, therefore,\nhave taken the parallax of that luminary by a method, not only\nmuch more perfect than that said to be invented by Hipparchus,\nbut little inferior in exactness to that now in use among the\nmoderns;–who could scarcely have made a mere guess when they\nfixed the moon’s distance from its primary planet at fifty-nine\nsemi-diameters of the earth;–who had measured the circumference\nof our globe with so much exactness that their calculation only\ndiffered by a few feet from that made by our modern\ngeometricians; –who held that the moon and the other planets\nwere worlds like our own, and that the moon was diversified by\nmountains and valleys and seas;–who asserted that there was yet\na planet which revolved round the sun, beyond the orbit of\nSaturn;–who reckoned the planets to be sixteen in number; –and\nwho reckoned the length of the tropical year within three minutes\nof the true time; nor, indeed, were they wrong at all, if a\ntradition mentioned by Plutarch be correct.\"[64]",

        "Bailly, Sir W. Jones, Higgins, and Ledwich, as well as many\nmodern writers, agree in the conclusion that the Indians, the\nEgyptians, the Assyrians, and the Chinese were simply the\ndepositaries, not the inventors, of science.  The spirit of\ninquiry which in later times is directing attention to the almost\nburied past is revealing the fact that not merely the germs\nwhence our present civilization has been developed descended to\nus from the dim ages of antiquity, but that a great number of the\nactual benefits which go to make up our present state of material\nprogress have come to us from prehistoric times.  The art of\nwriting, of navigation (including the use of the compass), the\nworking of metals, astronomy, the telescope, gunpowder,\nmathematics, democracy, building, weaving, dyeing, and many of\nthe appliances of civilized life, have been appropriated by later\nages with no acknowledgment of the source whence they were\nderived.  When Pythagoras exhibited to the Greeks some beautiful\nspecimens of ancient architecture which he had brought from Egypt\nand Babylon, they simply claimed them as their own, giving no\ncredit to the people who originated them; and subsequent ages,\ncopying their example, have refused to acknowledge that anything\nof value had been achieved prior to the first Greek Olympiad.",
        "When Philip of Macedon opened the gold mines of Thrace, a country\nin which it will be remembered the worship of the Great Mother\nCybele was indigenous, he found that they had been previously\nworked “at great expense and with great ingenuity by a people\nwell versed in mechanics, of whom no monuments whatever are\nextant.”",

Diodorus Siculus\nsays there was an island west of the Celtae in which the Druids\nbrought the sun and moon near them.  An instrument has recently\nbeen found in the sands of the Nile, the construction of which\nshows plainly that 6000 years ago the Egyptians were acquainted\nwith our modern ideas of the science of astronomy.",

When I\nwas there a year ago, and men were digging among the ruined\ntemples, some curious things were brought to light, and these I\nregard as the strangest things seen in all my wanderings.  In an\nold tomb was found a curious iron and glass object, which on\ninvestigation proved to be a photographic camera.  It was not\nsuch a camera as is used now, or has been since our photography\nwas invented, but something analogous to it, showing that the art\nwhich we thought we had discovered was really known 6000 years\nago.”",

In answer to\nthe suggestion that such information might have been conveyed by\nmeans of signal fires, this writer says that such fires would\nhave attracted the attention of the English and native scouts,\nand that the whole country is unpropitious to such methods;\nbesides, no system of signal fires, no matter how elaborate,\ncould have conveyed the news so quickly and in such detail.  The\nwhole matter is summed up as follows:",
        "“The Arabs, therefore, have, manifestly, some other means of\nrapid communication at their command.  One is inclined to the\npresumption that they, like the learned Pundits of Northern\nIndia, have a knowledge of the forces of Nature that are yet\nhidden from our most eminent scientists.”",

The scouts in Crook’s column to the south knew\nof it almost immediately, as did those with Gibbon farther\nnorthwest.  The same writer says that several years ago a naval\nlieutenant ran short of provisions.  He pushed on to a settlement\nas rapidly as possible and upon arriving there found that the\ninhabitants had provided for his coming and had a bounteous store\nawaiting him.  The people in the village were of a different\ntribe from those whose domain he had passed, and so far as could\nbe learned were not in communication with them.",
        "The earliest accounts which we have of Egypt and Chaldea reveal\nthe fact that at a very remote period they were old and powerful\ncivilizations, that they had a settled government, a pure and\nphilosophical religion, and a profound knowledge of science and\nart; yet, notwithstanding the great antiquity of these\ncivilizations, that of the people which created them must have\nbeen infinitely more remote.",
        "The earliest historic nations recognized the greatness of these\nancient people and the extent of their dominion.  In the oldest\ngeographical writings of the Sanskrit people, the ancient\nEthiopia, or land of Cush of Greek and Hebrew antiquity, is\nclearly described.  Stephanus of Byzantium, who is said to\nrepresent the opinions of the most ancient Greeks, says:\n\"Ethiopia was the first established country on the earth, and the\nEthiopians were the first who introduced the worship of the Gods\nand who established laws.\"[65]",
        "[65] Quoted by John D. Baldwin, Prehistoric Nations, p. 62.",
        "Heeren in his researches says:",
        "“From the remotest times to the present, the Ethiopians have been\none of the most celebrated, and yet the most mysterious of\nnations.  In the earliest traditions of nearly all the more\ncivilized nations of antiquity, the name of this distant people\nis found.  The annals of the Egyptian priests are full of them,\nand the nations of inner Asia, on the Euphrates and Tigris, have\ninterwoven the fictions of the Ethiopians with their traditions\nof the wars and conquests of their heroes; and, at a period\nequally remote, they glimmer in Greek mythology.  When the Greeks\nscarcely knew Italy and Sicily by name, the Ethiopians were\ncelebrated in the verses of their poets, and when the faint gleam\nof tradition and fable gives way to the clear light of history,\nthe lustre of the Ethiopians is not diminished.”",
        "Homer says of them that they were a “divided people dwelling at\nthe ends of the earth toward the setting and the rising Sun.” \nAlthough it is possible at the present time to discover very many\nof the facts bearing upon the civilization of this ancient\npeople, it is impossible in the present condition of human\nknowledge to discover when civilized life began on the earth. \nWhether the ancient Arabians or Ethiopians who belonged to the\nold Cushite race, and who are believed by many to be the most\nancient people of whom we have any trace, were the first\ncolonizers, or whether they were preceded by a still older\ncivilization, history and tradition are alike silent; yet the\nfact seems to be tolerably well authenticated that this\nenlightened race, now nearly extinct, carried civilization to\nChaldea more than seven thousand years B.C., that it colonized\nEgypt, engrafted its own institutions in India, colonized\nPhoenicia, and by its maritime and commercial enterprise,\nintroduced civilized conditions into every quarter of the globe. \nEven in Peru, in Mexico, in Central America, and in the United\nStates are evidences of the old Cushite religion and enterprise.",
        "Baldwin, commenting on the greatness of this remarkable people,\nsays that early in the period of its colonizing enterprise,\ncommercial greatness, and extensive empire, it established\ncolonies in the valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates, which in\nlater ages became Barbary, Egypt, and Chaldea.  The ancient\nCushite nation occupied Arabia and other extensive regions of\nAfrica, India, and Western Asia to the Mediterranean.  While\nremarking upon the vastness and antiquity of this old Cushite\nrace, Rawlinson says that they founded most of the towns of\nWestern Asia.  The vast commercial system which formed a\nconnecting link between the various countries of the globe, was\ncreated by this people, the great manufacturing skill and\nunrivalled maritime activity of the Phoenicians which extended\ndown to the time of the Hellenes and the Romans having been a\nresult of the irgenius.  It was doubtless during the supremacy of\nthe ancient Cushite race that a knowledge of astronomy was\ndeveloped and that the arts of life were carried to a high degree\nof perfection.  However, through the peculiar influences which\nwere brought to bear upon human experience, this knowledge, which\nwas bequeathed to their descendants or to the nations which they\nhad created, was subsequently lost or practically obscured, only\nfragments of it having been preserved from the general ruin.",
        "Within these fragments have been preserved in India certain\nevidences of a profound knowledge of Nature, or of the at present\nunknown forces in the universe, a demonstration of which, in our\nown time, would probably be looked upon as a miraculous\ninterposition of supernatural agencies.",
        "Regarding the refinements and luxuries of this ancient people,\nDiodorus Siculus declares that they flowed in streams of gold and\nsilver, that “the porticoes of their temples were overlaid with\ngold, and that the adornments of their buildings were in some\nparts of silver and gold, and in others of ivory and precious\nstones, and other things of great value.”",
        "From various observations, it is plain that the Etrurians\nrepresented a stage of civilization far in advance of the\nPelasgians who founded Rome –a race which, although superior in\nnumbers, arms, and influence, were, when compared with this more\nancient people, little better than barbarians.[66]",
        "[66] It is thought that as early as the nineteenth century B.C. \nthe Pelasgians or Pelargians went to Aenonia, or Ionia.  It was a\ndetachment of this people which, according to Herodotus, captured\na number of Athenian women on the coast of Africa, lived with\nthem as wives, and raised families by them, but, “because they\ndiffered in manners from themselves,” they murdered them, which\nact was attended by a “dreadful pestilence.”  It is the opinion\nof certain writers that these women were of a different religious\nfaith from their captors, and that so intense and bitter was the\nfeeling upon the comparative importance of the sex functions in\npro-creation, that their husbands, unable to change their views,\nput an end to their existence.",
        "Nothing, perhaps, proclaims the degree of civilization attained\nby the ancient Etrurians more plainly than the exquisite\nperfection which is observed in the specimens of art found in\ntheir tumuli.  Within the tombs of Etruscans buried long prior to\nthe foundation of Rome, or the birth of the fine arts in Greece,\nhave been found unmistakable evidence of the advanced condition\nof this people.  The exquisite coloring and grouping of the\nfigures on their elegant vases, one of which, on exhibition in\nthe British Museum, portrays the birth of Minerva, or Wisdom,\nshow the delicacy of their taste, the purity of their\nconceptions, and their true artistic skill.",
        "Among their mechanical arts, a few specimens of which have been\npreserved, is the potter’s wheel, an invention which, so far as\nits utility is concerned, is declared to be absolutely\nperfect–the most complete of all the instruments of the world. \n\"It never has been improved and admits of no improvement.”  In\nfact all that may be gathered concerning the ancient Etrurians, a\npeople who by the most able writers upon this subject is believed\nto have been one of the first to leave the Asiatic hive, is in\nperfect accord with the facts already set forth regarding that\nmighty nation, perhaps of upper Asia, who carried the study of\nastronomy to a degree of perfection never again reached until\nafter the discovery of the Copernican system, who invented the\nNeros and the Metonic Cycle, who colonized Egypt and Chaldea, and\nwho carried civilization to the remotest ends of the earth.",
        "The philosophy of the Etrurians corresponds with that of the most\nancient Hindoo system, and displays a degree of wisdom\nunparalleled by any of the peoples belonging to the early\nhistoric ages.  According to their cosmogony, the evolutionary or\ncreative processes involved twelve vast periods of time.  At the\nend of the first period appeared the planets and the earth, in\nthe second the firmament was made, in the third the waters were\nbrought forth, in the fourth the sun, moon, and stars were placed\nin the heavens, in the fifth living creatures appeared on the\nearth, and in the sixth man was produced.  These six periods\ncomprehended one-half the duration of the cycle.  After six more\nperiods had elapsed, or after the lapse of the entire cycle of\ntwelve periods, all creation was dissolved or drawn to the source\nof all life.  Subsequently a new creation was brought forth under\nwhich the same order of events will take place.  The involution\nof life, or its return to the great source whence it sprang, did\nnot, however, involve the destruction of matter.  The seeds of\nreturning life were preserved in an ark or boat–the female\nprinciple, within which all things are contained.  This indrawing\nof life constituted “the night of Brahme.”  It was represented by\nVishnu sleeping on the bottom of the sea.",
        "From the facts adduced in relation to the Etrurians we are not\nsurprised to find that their religion was that of the ancient\nNature worshippers, and that a mother with her child stood for\ntheir god-idea.  In referring to the religion of this people, and\nto the great antiquity of the worship of the Virgin and Child,\nHiggins remarks: “Amongst the Gauls, more than a hundred years\nbefore the Christian era, in the district of Chartres, a festival\nwas celebrated in honor of the Virgin,” and in the year 1747, a\nmithraic monument was found “on which is exhibited a female\nnursing an infant–the Goddess of the year nursing the God day.” \nTo which he adds: “The Protestant ought to recollect that his\nmode of keeping Christmas Day is only a small part of the old\nfestival as it yet exists amongst the followers of the Romish\nChurch. Theirs is the remnant of the old Etruscan worship of the\nvirgin and child.”  As a proof of the above, Higgins cites\nGorius’s Tuscan Antiquities, where may be seen the figure of an\nold Goddess with her child in her arms, the inscription being in\nEtruscan characters.  “No doubt the Romish Church would have\nclaimed her for a Madonna, but most unluckily she has her name,\nNurtia, in Etruscan letters, on her arm, after the Etruscan\npractice.”",
        "From the monuments of Etruria the fact is observed that descent\nand the rights of succession were traced in the female line, a\ncondition of society which indicates the high position which must\nhave been occupied by the women of that country.",
        "In Oman is said to exist a fragment of the government of the old\nEthiopian or Cushite race.  If this is true, then we may be able\nto perceive at the present time something of the character of the\npolitical institutions of this ancient nation.  As no people\nremains stationary, and as degeneracy has been the rule with\nsurrounding countries, we may not expect to find among the people\nof Oman a true representation of ancient conditions, yet, as has\nbeen observed, we may still be able to note some of the facts\nrelative to the organization of society and their governmental\ninstitutions.",
        "In a description furnished by Palgrave, Oman is termed a kingdom,\nyet it is plain from the observations of this writer that the\nexisting form of government is that of a confederacy of nations\nunder a democratical system, identical with that developed during\nthe later status of barbarism.  This writer himself admits that\nOman is less a kingdom than an aggregation of municipalities, and\nthat each of these municipalities or towns has a separate\nexistence and is controlled by its own local chief; but that all\nare joined together in one confederacy, and subjected to the\nleadership of a grand chief whom the writer is pleased to term\n\"the crown,” but why, as is evident from the description given,\nbears no resemblance to a modern monarch. The chiefs who direct\nthe councils of the municipalities are limited in their powers by\n\"the traditional immunities of the vassals,” the decision of all\ncriminal cases and the administration of justice being in the\nhands of the local judges.  In the descriptions given of their\ngovernmental proceedings, it is stated that the whole course of\nlaw is considered apart from the jurisdiction of the sovereign,\nwho has no power to either change or annul the enactments of the\npeople.",
        "Here, it is observed, exists almost the identical form of\ngovernment which was in use among the early historic nations,\nbefore governments came to be founded on wealth, or on a\nterritorial basis[67]; or, in other words, before the monied and\naristocratic classes had drawn to themselves all the powers which\nhad formerly belonged to the people.",
        "[67] See The Evolution of Woman, p. 238.",
        "We must bear in mind the fact that under these earlier\ndemocratical institutions, the term “people” included not only\nmen but women, and as the grand chief, the local rulers, and the\njudges held their positions by virtue of their descent from, or\nrelationship to, some real or traditional leader of the gens, who\nduring all the earlier ages was a woman, we may believe that the\npower of women to depose their political leaders so soon as their\nconduct became obnoxious to them was absolute and unquestioned.",
        "Doubtless, as we have seen, the government of Oman has undergone\na considerable degree of modification since the days of Cushite\nsplendor and supremacy; that, like all other nations which have\ncome in contact with the Aryan and Semitic races, the tendency\nhas been toward monarchial government; nevertheless, with its\npractically free institutions, representing as they do, in a\nmeasure, the political system of the grandest and oldest\ncivilizations of which we have any knowledge, it furnishes an\nillustration of the degree of progress possible under gentile\norganization, at the same time that it points to the source\nwhence has proceeded the fierce democratic spirit observed among\nsucceeding nations, notably the Greeks.",
        "Modern writers agree in ascribing to the Touaricks, a people\ninhabiting the Desert of Sahara, a considerable degree of\ncivilization.  We are informed that in the Sahara, which, by the\nway, is far less a barren waste than we have been taught to\nsuppose it, “the Touaricks have towns, cities, and an excellent\ncondition of agriculture\"; that with them fruit is cultivated\nwith great success and skill.  Their method of political\norganization is democratic and similar in construction and\nadministration to the old Cushite municipalities.  Baldwin,\nquoting from Richardson, says: “Ghat, like all the Touarick\ncountries, is a republic; all the people govern.  The woman of\nthe Touaricks is not the woman of the Moors and Mussulmans\ngenerally.  She has here great liberty, and takes an active part\nin the affairs and transactions of life.\"[68]",

        "One who is disposed to search for it, will find no lack of\nevidence going to prove that in an earlier age of the world,\nprior to the written records of extant history, the human race\nhad attained to a stage of civilization equal in all and superior\nin many respects to that of the present time.",
        "That this remarkable stage of progress, the actual extent of\nwhich has not yet been fully realized, was attained during a\nperiod of pure Nature-worship, or while the earth and the sun\nwere venerated as emblems of the great creative energy throughout\nthe universe, is a proposition which, when viewed by the light of\nmore recently acquired facts, is perfectly reasonable, and\nexactly what might be expected.",
        "That this high stage of civilization was reached while women were\nthe recognized heads of families and of the gentes, and at a time\nwhen Perceptive Wisdom, or the female energy in the Deity, was\nworshipped as the supreme God, is a fact which in time will be\nproved beyond a doubt.  Indeed, had not the judgment of man\nbecome warped by prejudice, and his reason clogged by\nsuperstition and sensuality, the fact so plainly apparent in all\nancient mythologies, that in the early god-idea two principles\nwere contained, the female being in the ascendancy, would long\nere this have been acknowledged, and our present religious\nsystems, which are but outgrowths from these mythologies, would,\nwith the partial return of civilized conditions, have been so\nmodified or changed as to embrace some of the fundamental truths\nwhich formed the basis of early religion.",
        "Regarding the religion of the ancient race which we have been\nconsidering, we are told that they worshipped a dual Deity, under\nthe appellations of Ashtaroth and Baal, and that this God\n\"comprehended the generative or reproductive powers in human\nbeings and in the sun, together with Wisdom or Light.”  In other\nwords, they adored the great moving force throughout Nature, a\nforce which they venerated as the Great Mother.",
        "Before the Zend and Sanskrit branches of the Aryan race had\nseparated, their religion was doubtless that given them by their\nCushite civilizers.  The worship of the sun and the planets, with\nwhich were inextricably interwoven the fructifying agencies in\nNature, explains their devotion to the study of the heavenly\nbodies and their advanced knowledge of astronomy.  The types of\nregeneration or reproduction which they venerated were symbols of\nabstract principles, and, from facts connected with their\nreligious ceremonies as practiced by their immediate successors,\nand from the pure significance attached to their emblems, we are\njustified in the conclusion before referred to, that the sensuous\nelement, which became so prominent in later religious\ndevelopments, constituted no part of their worship.",
        "The number of ages during which the most primitive religion,\nnamely, that of pure Nature-worship, prevailed among the\ninhabitants of the earth may not be conjectured, and the exact\nlength of time during which earth and sun adoration unalloyed by\nserpent and phallic faiths remained is not known.  It is\nprobable, however, that its duration is to be measured by that of\nthe supremacy of the altruistic or mother element in human\naffairs, and that the gradual engrafting of the later-developed\nsensuous faiths upon their earlier god-idea, marks the change\nfrom female to male supremacy.",
        "We have observed that whenever a remnant of the civilization of\nthe ancient Cushites appears, exactly as might be expected, women\nhold an exalted position in human affairs, at the same time that\nthe female principle constitutes the essential element in the\nDeity.",

It would appear that in former days the\nwomen of Persia had an assigned and honorable place in society;\nand we must conclude that an equal rank with the male creation,\nwhich is secured to them by the ordinances of Zoroaster, existed\nlong before the time of that reformer, who paid too great\nattention to the habits and prejudices of his countrymen to have\nmade any serious alteration in so important an usage.  We are\ntold by Quintus Curtius, that Alexander would not sit in the\npresence of Sisygambis, till told to do so by that matron,\nbecause it is not the custom in Persia for sons to sit in the\npresence of their mothers.  There can be no stronger proof than\nthis anecdote affords, of the great respect in which the female\nsex were held in that country, at the time of this invasion.\"[69]",
        "[69] See History of Persia.",
        "No one I think can study the sacred books of the Persians without\nobserving the emphasis which is there placed on purity of\ncharacter and right living.  Indeed, within no extant writings is\nthe antithesis between good and evil more strongly marked, at the\nsame time that their hatred of idolatry is clearly apparent.  The\nsame is observed in the early writings of the Hindoos.  Within\nthe Vedas, although they have been corrupted by later writers,\nmay still be traced a purity of thought and life which is not\napparent in the writings of later ages.  Not long ago I was\ninformed by a learned native of India that the original writing\nof the Vedas was largely the work of women.",
        "That the early conceptions of a Deity in which women constituted\nthe central and supreme figure were in Egypt correlated with the\nexercise of great temporal power, may not, in view of the facts\nat hand, longer be doubted.  By means of records revealed on\nancient monuments, we are informed that in the age of Amunoph I. \na considerable degree of sovereign power in Egypt was exercised\nby a woman, Amesnofre-are, who had shared the throne with Ames. \nShe occupied it also with Amunoph, and, notwithstanding the\nstatement of Herodotus, that women did not serve in the capacity\nof priests, this Queen is represented as pouring out libations to\nAmon, an office which was doubtless the highest connected with\nthe priesthood.",
        "Less than forty years later, it is observed that another woman,\nAmun-nou-het, shared the throne with Thotmes I. and II. and that\n\"she appears to have enjoyed far greater consideration than\neither of them.”  Not alone are monuments raised in her name, but\nshe appears dressed as a man, and “alone presenting offerings to\nthe gods.”  So important a personage was she that she is believed\nby many to be the princess who conquered the country, perhaps\neven Semiramis herself.  Her title was the “Shining Sun.\"[70]",

        "As these women doubtless belonged to the old Arabian, Ethiopian,\nor Cushite race, the people who had brought civilization to\nEgypt, we are not surprised to find them holding positions which\nwere connected with the highest civil and religious offices.  The\nLabyrinth, in the country of the Nile, is described by ancient\nwriters as containing three thousand chambers.  Strabo says of it\nthat the enclosure contained as many palaces as there formerly\nwere homes, and that there the priests and priestesses of each\ndepartment were wont to congregate to discuss difficult and\nimportant questions of law.",
        "According to the Greeks, the Egyptian God Osiris corresponds to\ntheir Jupiter; and Sate, the companion of Kneph, is identical\nwith Juno.  It is quite evident, however, that the Greeks\nunderstood little of the true significance of the gods which they\nhad borrowed, or which they had inherited from older nations.  It\nwould seem that as a people their conceit prevented them from\nacknowledging the dignity even of their gods, hence, they endowed\nthem with the attributes best suited to their own depraved taste\nor pleasure, and then worshipped them as beings like themselves.",
        "It has been observed of the Egyptians that they were wont to\nridicule the Greeks for regarding their gods as actual beings,\nwhile in reality “they were only the representations of the\nattributes and principles of Nature.”  Unlike the religions which\nsucceeded it, Egyptian mythology, as understood by the learned,\nwas essentially philosophical, and dealt with abstractions and\nprinciples rather than with personalities.",
        "Notwithstanding the importance which in process of time came to\nbe claimed by males, and the consequent stimulation which was\ngiven to the animal tendencies, it is evident, from certain\nhistorical and undeniable proofs in connection with this subject,\nthat although woman’s power in Egypt, as in all other countries,\ngradually became weakened, the effect of her influence on manners\nand social customs was never wholly extinguished.",
        "Regarding the existence of polygamy, it has been said that the\nhigh position occupied in ancient Egypt by the mother of the\nfamily, the mistress of the household, is absolutely\nirreconcilable with the existence of polygamy as a general\npractice, or of such an institution as the harem.  Although the\nplurality of wives does not appear to have been contrary to law,\nit “certainly was unusual,” and although Egyptian kings\nfrequently had many wives, “they followed foreign rather than\nnative custom.\"[71]",

        "Were we in possession of no direct historical evidence to prove\nthat down to a late period in the history of Egypt women had not\nlost their prestige, sufficient evidence would be found in the\nfact that, notwithstanding the growing tendency of mankind in all\nthe nations of the globe to suppress the female instincts and to\nreject, conceal, or belittle the woman element in the Deity,\nstill Isis, the gracious mother, retained a prominent place in\nthe god-idea of that country.",
        "I am not unmindful of the remarks which a reference to a past age\nof intellectual and moral greatness will call forth; indeed, I\ncan almost hear some devotee of the present time remark: “So we\nare asked to regard as a sober fact the existence in the past of\na golden age; also to believe that man was created pure and holy,\nand that he has since fallen from his high estate; in other\nwords, we are to have faith in the ancient tradition of the ’fall\nof man.’”  If by the fall of man we are to understand that a\ngreat and universal people, who in a remote age of the world’s\nhistory had reached a high stage of civilization, gradually\npassed out of human existence, and that a lower race, which was\nincapable of attaining to their estate, and which, by the over-\nstimulation of the lower propensities, sank into a state of\nbarbarism, in which the original sublime conceptions of a Deity\nwere obscured and the great learning of the past was lost, I can\nsee no reason to disbelieve it, especially as all the facts, both\nof tradition and history, bearing upon this subject unite in\nproclaiming its truth.",
        "After stating that in Chaldea has been found rather the debris of\nscience than the elements of it, Bailly asks:",
        "“When you see a house built of old capitals, columns, and other\nfragments of beautiful architecture, do you not conclude that a\nfine building has once existed? .  .  .  If the human mind can\never flatter itself with having been successful in discovering\nthe truth, it is when many facts, and these facts of different\nkinds, unite in producing the same results.”",
        "That the descendants of a once mighty nation lapsed into\nbarbarism, forgetting the profound knowledge of the sciences\npossessed by their ancestors, is a fact too well attested at the\npresent time to be doubted by those who have taken the pains to\nacquaint themselves with the evidence at hand.",
        "Regarding the manner in which this ancient civilization was\nreached, or concerning the way in which it was achieved, history\nand tradition are alike silent, although it is believed that the\npresent methods of investigation will, at least in a measure,\nunravel the mystery.  At present we only know that, as far in the\nremote past as human ken can reach, evidences of a high stage of\ncivilization exist which it must have required thousands upon\nthousands of years to accomplish.",
        "After the decline of Nature-worship, and when through the\nconstantly increasing power gained by the ruder elements in human\nsociety a knowledge of the scientific principles underlying\nancient religion had been partially lost or forgotten, it became\nnecessary for philosophers to conceal the original conception of\nthe Deity and to clothe their sacred writings in allegory.  Hence\nit is observed that every ancient form of religion has a cabala\ncontaining its secret doctrines–doctrines the inner meaning of\nwhich was known only to the few.  In order that these truths\nmight be preserved, they were inscribed on the leaves of trees in\ncharacters or symbols understood only by the initiated.  The\nallegories beneath which these higher truths were concealed were\nhanded down as traditions to succeeding generations–traditions\nin which history, astrology, and mythology are strangely\ncombined.",
        "After long periods, through war, conquest, and the various\nchanges incidental to shifting environment, these traditions were\nin the main forgotten.  Fragments of them, however, were from\ntime to time gathered together, and, intermingled with later\ndoctrines, were used by the priests as a means of increased\nself-aggrandizement and power.",
        "It is now thought that the Iliad (Rhapsodies) of Homer is only a\nnumber of “detached songs” which perhaps for centuries were\ndelivered orally, and that they contain the secret doctrines of\nthe priests.  Porphyry says that “we ought not to doubt that\nHomer has secretly represented the images of divine things under\nthe concealment of fable.”  It has been said of Plato that he\nbanished the poems of Homer from his imaginary republic for the\nreason that the people might not be able to distinguish what is\nfrom what is not allegorical.  Hippolytus informs us that the\nSimonists declared that in Helen resided the principle of\nintelligence; “and thus, when all the powers were for claiming\nher for themselves, sedition and war arose, during which this\nchief power was manifested to nations.”  These songs which were\ngathered together by Pisistratus and revised by Aristotle for the\nuse of Alexander, have generally been regarded merely as a bit of\nhistory recounting a severe and protracted struggle between the\nGreeks and Trojans.",
        "Within the earliest historical accounts which we have of the\nEgyptians, we observe that their ceremonies and symbols have\nalready become multitudinous, the true meaning of the latter\nbeing concealed.  The masses of the people, who had grown too\nsensualized and ignorant to receive the higher divine\n\"mysteries,” and too gross to be entrusted with their true\nsignificance, had become idolaters.",
        "Not only the Egyptian and Chaldean priests, but Moses and the\nJewish doctors were well versed in religious symbolism.  The fact\nis observed, also, that as late as medieval Christianity, the\nfathers in the Church, the Christian painters, sculptors, and\narchitects, still employed signs and symbols to set forth their\nreligious doctrines.  Even at the present time, many of the\nemblems representing certain ideas connected with the creative\nprinciples, and which were part and parcel of the pagan worship,\nare still in use.  The masses of the people, however, are without\na knowledge of their origin or early significance.",
        "Everywhere, throughout the early historic nations, were\nworshipped symbols of the attributes or functions of the dual or\ntriune God.  Each symbol represented a distinctive female or male\nquality.  Animals, trees, the sea, plants, the moon, and the\nheavens were, at a certain stage of religious development,\nsymbolized as parts of the Deity and worshipped as possessing\ncertain female or male characteristics or attributes.",
        "It is plain that, with the decline of female power, and the\nconsequent stimulation of the animal instincts in man, the pure\ncreative principles involved in Nature-worship gradually became\nunsuited to the sensualized capacities and tastes of the masses;\nbut in addition to this were other reasons why the female\nprinciple in the Deity should be concealed.  Women were already\ndeposed from their former exalted position as heads of families\nand as leaders of consanguine communities.  All their rightful\nprerogatives had been usurped.  The highest development in Nature\nhad become the slave of man’s appetites, and motherhood, which\nhad hitherto been accepted as the most exalted function either in\nheaven or on the earth, trailed in the dust.",
        "Under these conditions it is not perhaps singular that the\ncapacity to bring forth, and the qualities and attributes of\nwomen which are correlated with it, namely, sympathy–a desire\nfor the welfare of others outside of self, or altruism,–should\nno longer have been worshipped as divine, or that in their place\nshould have been substituted the leading characters developed in\nman.  From the facts at hand it is plain that at a certain stage\nof human growth physical might and male reproductive energy, or\nvirility, became the recognized God.  With passion as the highest\nideal of a Creator, the female element appeared only in a\nsensualized form and simply as an appendage to the god which was\ndependent upon her ministrations.  Under the above conditions it\nis not in the least remarkable that by the priests it should have\nbeen deemed necessary to conceal from women the facts bound up in\ntheir nature.  Woman’s importance as a creative agency and as a\nprime and most essential factor in the universe must be\nconcealed.  “Isis must be veiled.”",
        "Through the appropriation of the titles of the original dual God\nby reigning monarchs, is perceived at least one of the processes\nby which the great universal female Deity of the ancients has\nbeen transformed into a male god.  We are assured that the\n\"redundant nomenclature of the deities of Babylon renders an\ninterpretation of them impossible.  Each divinity has many\ndistinct names, by which he is indifferently designated.”  It is\nobserved that each",
        "Deity has as many as forty or fifty titles, each of which\nrepresents a certain attribute.",
        "Since the invention of the cuneiform alphabet, by which pictures\nhave been reduced to phonetic signs, the attempt has been made to\narrange or classify these gods according to their proper order in\nthe Pantheon, but thus far much obscurity and doubt seem to\npervade their history.",
        "In Assyrian, Babylonian, and Egyptian mythologies are observed\nmuch confusion and no small degree of mystery surrounding the\npositions occupied by certain gods.  “Children not unfrequently\nchange positions with parents,” but more frequently, we are told,\n\"women change places with men,” or, more properly speaking, the\ntitles, attributes, and qualities ascribed to the Great Universal\nfemale God are now transferred to the reigning monarch. Thus not\nunfrequently a deity is observed which is composed of a male\ntriad, the central figure of which is the king or military\nchieftain, and to which is usually appended a straggling fourth\nmember, a female, who, shorn of her power, and with a doubtful\nand mysterious title, appears as wife or mistress to his\ngreatness, while upon her is reflected, through him, a slight\nhint of that dignity and honor which was originally recognized as\nbelonging exclusively to the recognized Deity.",
        "The Goddess Vishnu, from whose navel as she slept on the bottom\nof the sea sprang all creation, after her transformation into a\nmale God, is supplemented by a wife–Lacksmir.  Lacksmir means\nwisdom; but she has become only an appendage to her “lord,” upon\nwhom is reflected all her former glory.",
        "So greedy did rulers become for the splendid titles belonging to\nthe female divinities that we are told that “the name of the\nGreat Goddess Astarte not unfrequently appears as that of a man.”",
        "Although man had usurped the titles of the female God and had\ndenied her recognition as an active creative agency, still, as\nnothing could be created without her, she was permitted, as we\nhave seen, to remain as wife or mistress to the reigning monarch,\nin whom had come to reside infinite wisdom and power.  Her symbol\nwas an ark, chest, boat, box, or cave.  This woman, although\ndignified by the title “Mother of the Gods,” and even by that of\n\"Queen of Heaven,” is utterly without power.",
        "Not only is it plain that the titles and attributes of female\ngods have been appropriated by males, but it is also true that\nthe more ancient deities, which are now known to have been\nfemale, have by later investigators been represented as male.",
        "The interpretations which have hitherto been put upon the\nBabylonian and Assyrian deities by many of those who have\nattempted to unravel the mysteries of an earlier stage of\nreligious worship, is doubtless due to the fact that since the\nso-called historic period began, the qualities which have been\nconsidered godlike have all been masculine; it has therefore\nnever occurred to the minds of these writers that the ancients\nmay have entertained quite different notions from their own\nregarding the attributes of a Deity; hence, whenever the sex of a\ngod has appeared doubtful, especially if it be in the least\ndegree powerful or important, it has at once been denominated as\nmasculine, and this, too, notwithstanding the fact that such\nrendering has oftentimes involved inconsistencies,\ncontradictions, and absurdities which it is impossible to\nreconcile either with established facts or with common sense.",
        "Unless the symbols representing religious belief and worship are\nviewed in the light of later developed facts in mythology,\narchaeology, and philology, there occur many seeming absurdities\nand numberless facts which it is found difficult to reconcile\nwith each other; especially is this true in regard to some of the\nsymbols used to express the distinctive female and male\nqualities.  The serpent, for instance, although a male symbol, in\ncertain ages of the world’s history appears as a beautiful woman.",
        "This is accounted for by the fact that a woman and a serpent once\nstood for the god-idea.  Together they constituted an indivisible\nentity–the creating power in the universe.  They therefore\nbecame interchangeable terms.  The woman when appearing alone\nrepresented both, as did also the serpent.",
        "“In most ancient languages, probably all, the name for the\nserpent signifies Life, and the roots of these words generally\nalso signify the male and female organs, and sometimes these\nconjoined.  In low French the words for Phallus and life have the\nsame sound, though, as is sometimes the case, the spelling and\ngender differ\"; but this fact is thought to be of no material\nimportance, as “Jove, Jehova, sun, and moon have all been male\nand female by turn.”",
        "No doubt many of the inconsistencies hitherto observed in the\nreligion of the ancients will disappear so soon as we obtain a\nclearer knowledge of their chronology; and events which now seem\ncontradictory will be satisfactorily explained when placed in\ntheir proper order with regard to date.  Religion, like\neverything else, is constantly shifting its position to\naccommodate itself to the changed mental conditions of its\nadherents; hence, ideas which at any given time in the past were\nperfectly suited to a people, would, in the course of five\nhundred or one thousand years, have become changed or greatly\nmodified.",
        "During a certain stage in human history “all great women and\nmythical ladies were serpents\"; but when monumentally or\npictorially represented, they appeared “with the head of a woman,\nwhile the body was that of a reptile.”  This figure represented\nWisdom and Passion, or the spiritual and material planes of human\nexistence.  The mythical woman whom Hercules met in Scythia, and\nwho was doubtless the original eponymous leader of the Scythian\npeople, had the head of a woman and the body of a serpent.[73]\nEven the Mexicans declare that “he, the serpent, is the sun,\nTonakatl-Koatl, who ever accompanies their first woman.”  Their\nprimitive mother, they said, was Kihua-Kohuatl, which signifies a\nserpent.  In referring to this Mexican tradition, Forlong\nremarks: “So that the serpent here was represented as both Adam\nand Adama; and their Eden, as in Jewish story, was a garden of\nlove and pleasure.\"[74]",

        "[74] Rivers of Life, vol. i., p. 143.",
        "The traditions extant among all peoples seem to connect the\nintroduction of the serpent into religious symbolism, with a time\nin the history of mankind when they first began to recognize the\nfact, that through the abuse of the reproductive functions, evil,\nor human wretchedness, had gained the ascendency over the higher\nforces.  The Deity represented by a woman and a serpent involved\nthe idea not alone of good, but of good and evil combined. \nTogether they prefigured not only Wisdom and generative power,\nbut evil as well.  Mythologically they represented the cold of\nwinter and the heat of the sun’s rays, both of which were\nnecessary reproduction.  From this conception sprang the Ormuzd\nand Ahryman of the Persians, the story of Adam, Eve, and the\nserpent in Genesis, and the legend of Kihua-Kohuatl and\nTonakatl-Koatl in Mexico.",
        "“The serpent remained in the memory and affections of most early\npeople as wisdom, life, goodness, and the source of knowledge and\nscience, under various names such as Toth, Hermes, Themis, the\nKneph or Sophia of Egyptians and Gnostics, and Set, Shet, or Shem\nof the Jews.\"[75]",
        "[75] Forlong, Rivers of Life, etc., vol. i., p. 143.",
        "The Serpent Goddess, although embracing evil as well as good, was\nstill the “Giver of Life” and the “Teacher of Mankind.”  These\nwere the titles which in later ages began to be coveted by\nmonarchs, and then it was that the attributes belonging to this\nDeity began to appear in connection with royalty.",
        "There is no ancient divinity about which there seems to be\nconnected so much mystery as the Assyrian Hea.  When referring to\nthe “great obscurity” which surrounds this God we are assured\nthat there is at present “no means of determining the precise\nmeaning of the cuneiform Hea, which is Babylonian rather than\nAssyrian,” but that it is doubtless connected with the Arabic\nHya, which is said to mean “life,” or the female principle in\ncreation.  This Deity is the God of “glory” and of “giving,\"\ntitles which during the earlier ages of human existence belonged\nto the Queen of Heaven, the Celestial Mother.",
        "The representation of the god Amun or Amun-ra, which superseded\nthe triune Deity, Kneph, Sate, and Anouk at Thebes, and from\nwhich in Assyria doubtless proceeded the trinity, Amun,\nBel-Nimrod, and Hea, is supposed to be identical with the Greek\nZeus, which means the sun.  This God is represented by a female\nfigure seated on a throne.  It is crowned with two long feathers,\nand in the right hand is observed the cross, the emblem of life. \nManetho, the celebrated Egyptian historian, declares that the\nname of this God signifies “concealed.”",
        "There can be little doubt that the titles of the ancient\nDeity–the Destroyer or Regenerator, or, in other words, those of\nthe God of life which embraced the idea of the moving force\nthroughout Nature, were, in course of time, appropriated by the\nrulers of the people.  It is stated that the name of a certain\nEgyptian God appears first in connection with royalty, that “his\nname was substituted for some earlier divinity whose\nhieroglyphics were chiselled out of the monuments to make place\nfor his.”",
        "According to the testimony of Rawlinson, the God Hea is\nrepresented by the great serpent, which occupies a conspicuous\nposition among the symbols of the gods on the black stones\nrecording Babylonian benefactions.  Now these flat black stones\nare themselves said to symbolize the female element in the Deity,\nin contradistinction to the obelisks, which prefigure the male,\nwhile the serpent, for reasons which have already been explained,\nappeared for ages in connection with the figure of a woman.  In\nlater inscriptions “king” is everywhere attached to the name of\nthe God Hea, which fact shows that the titles ascribed to her\nwere those particularly coveted by royalty.  Hence we are not\nsurprised to find that in an inscription of Sardanapalus, in the\nBritish Museum, there “occurs a remarkable phrase in which the\nking takes the titles of Hea.”",
        "Among the Assyrian inscriptions appear Bel-Nimrod, Hea, and Nin\nor Bar.  In view of the facts which have come to light regarding\nHea, it is altogether probable that the triad Bel-Nimrod, Hea,\nand Nin represent the trinity as figured by the father, mother,\nand child.  That Nin was the son or the child of Bel-Nimrod “is\nconstantly asserted in the inscriptions.”  He appears also as the\nson of Hea, yet the fact that Hea should be represented as a\nwoman, or as the mother of Nin, and the central figure in the\ntrinity, seems not to have been observed by those who thus far\nhave been engaged in deciphering these inscriptions.  By\nrepresenting Hea as male, Nin is made to appear as the offspring\nof two fathers while he is left absolutely motherless.  To\nobviate this difficulty an ingenious attempt has been made to\naccount for his existence by substituting his own wife as the\nauthor of his being.  Although in the numerous accounts which I\nhad read of Hea, in my search for information concerning her, she\nhad always been designated as male, still I was satisfied from\nthe descriptions given that originally this Deity was female. \nTherefore upon receiving a copy of Forlong’s Rivers of Life and\nFaiths of Man in All Lands, I was not surprised to find the\nfollowing:",
        "“Hoa or Hea, the Hu of our Keltic ancestors, whose symbol was the\nshield and the serpent, was worshipped near rivers and lakes, and\nif possible on the sea-shore, where were offered to her such\nemblems as a golden vessel, boat, coffer, or fish, and she was\nthen named Belat Ili (the mistress of the Gods).\"[76]",
        "[76] Vol. ii., p. 94.",
        "She was the Goddess of Water.  Of this Forlong says: “Water,\nperhaps more than fire, has always been used as a purifier.  .  . .\nChristians have but imitated the ancients, in the use of\nLustral water–now-a-days called Holy Water, and into which salt\nshould be freely put.”",
        "According to Francis Vasques, the Cibola tribes of New Mexico pay\nno adoration to anything but water, believing it to be the chief\nsupport of all life.  The Hindoo faith and the Greek Christian\nChurch prescribe “adorations, sacrifices, and other water rites,\nand hence we find all orthodox clergy and devotees have much to\ndo with rivers, seas, and wells, especially at certain annual\nsolar periods.”",
        "The extent to which these ancient rites are still practiced as\npart and parcel of modern religious observances is not realized\nby those who have given no special attention to the subject.  As\nspring advances, all ranks of Russians from the Czar to the\nhumblest peasant proceed with their clergy to the Neva, where\nwith solemn pomp the ice is broken and the water, which is held\nto be of virgin purity, is sprinkled upon the heads of Czar,\nnobles, and other dignitaries.  The following is an account given\nof the worship of Hea not many years ago in the public press:",
        "“An Imperial and Arch-episcopal procession was formed, consisting\nof, first, the High Priest of the empire in all his most gorgeous\nrobes, the two masters of ceremonies walking backwards (probably\nbecause not of a holy enough order), long double files of white-\nand gold-robed bearers of sacred flambeaux or candles, for Fire\nmust enter into every ceremony, whether it is the male or female\nenergy which is being worshipped.  Following these Religieux came\nall the sacred relics and fetishes of the Church, as Maya’s holy\ncup for water, all holy books, crosses, banners, with sacred\nemblems in their order, and finally the Czar, humbly, and, like\nall his people, on foot, followed by courtly throngs.  These all\nproceeded to a handsome pavilion or kiosk, erected close to the\nedge of the water, when the Metropolitan of the Church reverently\nmade an incision in the ice, and took out a little water in a\nsacred golden cup bearing strange devices.  The firing of guns\naccompanied these solemn acts in all their stages, and wherever\nthe grave procession moved, it always did so with measured tread,\nchanting sacred verses to the old, old Deity of our race, and\nsurrounded with all the pomp of war; whilst at intervals, peals\nof Christian bells and the booming of near and distant guns added\nto the solemnity of this water pageant.  After the filling of the\ngolden cup, which, of course, represents the earth and its\nfulness, and, at this season, the now expected increase, the High\nPriest placed a golden crucifix on the virgin water and blessed\nits return from wintry death, invoking the precious fluid to\nvernal life and productiveness, when lo! a holy child suddenly\nappears upon the scene, reminding us that this is everywhere the\noutcome of the ’wafers of life’ in all animal as well as\nvegetable production.  Boodha in the garden of Loobim through\nwhich flowed a holy stream, and Christ by the brook at Bethlehem,\nnay, the first pair in the garden of the four rivers, are all the\nsame idea–fertility and creation.  The high Russian Pontiff now\nslowly and solemnly stooped, and taking up some of the holy\nwater, proceeded to sprinkle the vernal child–Jesus, whispered\nthese crowds, but the ancients said Horus.  The sacred fluid was\nthen sprinkled on the clergy, the Czar, and all dignitaries, and\nfinally on the sacred emblems, banners, guns, etc.  Men and\nwomen, aye, wise as well as foolish, of every rank, now crowded\nforward, and on bended knee besought their Patriarch to sprinkle\nand to bless them.  Finally, the great Czar put the cup to his\nlips, humbly and reverently, and then filled it to overflowing\nwith a wealth of golden pieces, for it is the still living\nrepresentative in the nineteenth century A.C. of ’the golden\nboat’ of Hea of the nineteenth century B.C.’[77]",
        "[77] Forlong, Rivers of Life, vol. ii., p. 95.",
        "The symbol of Neith or Muth, Athene or Minerva, the great\nuniversal female principle of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans,\nwas the shield and serpent.  In Celtic Druids I find that Nath,\nthe Egyptian Neith, the “goddess of wisdom and science whose\nsymbol was the shield and serpent, was worshipped among the\nancient Irish.”  The male God associated with her was Naith, and\naccording to Higgins represented “the opposite of Neith.”",
        "In Rivers of Life is observed a reference to the Assyrian Goddess\nHea by Lucian.  In a note Forlong says that no doubt Hea is the\nsame as Haiya or Haya.  In other words she represents the\nuniversal hermaphrodite–the creative principle throughout\nNature, which was originally worshipped as female.  The actual\nsignification of the word Haya is “life.”  In ancient Arabia it\nwas applied to a group of kinsmen.",
        "The Rev. Mr. Davis is of the opinion that Noe or Noah was the\nsame as Deon and that both were Hu or Hea the mighty, whose\nchariot was drawn by solar rays.  This God was in fact the same\nas Zeus, Bacchus, and all the rest of the sun and water Deities. \nIt has been observed that, according to the ancient cosmogonies,\nwithin water was contained the life principle, and as a woman\npresided over it, or was the only being or entity present, she\nmust have been the self-existent Creator.  From this woman sprang\nall creation.  According to the account in Genesis, the Spirit of\nGod moved on the face of the deep and creation began.",
        "By all nations water has been employed as a symbol of\nregeneration, and as it contained the beginning of things it was\nfemale.  The Hindoos regard it as sacred, and in one of their\nmost solemn prayers it is thus invoked:  Waters, mothers of\nworlds, purify us![78]",
        "[78] Quoted by Inman from Colbrook, vol. i., p. 85.",
        "Doubtless it was from these ancient speculations regarding the\nbeginnings of things that Thales, the Milesian philosopher,\nreceived his doctrine that water is the original principle.  The\nancient Egyptians and the Jewish people to this day have the\ncustom of pouring out all the water contained in any vessel in a\nhouse where a death has taken place, because of the idea that as\nthe living being comes from water, so does it make its exit\nthrough water.  Hence “to drink or to use in any way a fluid\nwhich contains the life of human beings would be a foul offense.”",
        "The fact is noted by Inman that in all Assyrian mythology the\nwater God Hea is associated with life and with a serpent. \nAlthough Rawlinson declares that Hea is Babylonian rather than\nAssyrian, may she not, in view of the facts concerning her, be\nnot only Babylonian, but Egyptian, Indian, Phrygian, Mexican, and\nall the rest?",
        "It would seem that in this Deity, who is figured in connection\nwith a shield and serpent, as is Minerva, and who is worshipped\nnear water– an emblem which is sacred to her,–and whose titles\ncorrespond exactly to those of Neith or Cybele, might be traced\nthe remnants of a once universal worship–a worship in which the\nfemale energy constituted the Creator.",
        "Although it is declared that “great obscurity surrounds the God\nHea,” no one, I think, whose mind is free from prejudice, and who\nunderstands the significance of the early god-idea, and the true\nmeaning of the symbols used in later ages to express it, can\nstudy the myths connected with this Deity without at once\nrecognizing her identity with the great female God of Nature who\nwas once worshipped by every people on the globe, but whose\nworship had become sensualized to satisfy the corrupted taste of\na more depraved age–an age in which passion constituted the\nhighest idea of a God.",
        "Although the serpent Deity was originally portrayed with the head\nof a woman and the body of a serpent or fish, after the change of\nsex in the god-idea which has been noted in the foregoing pages\nhad been completed, it is observed that this figure is\nrepresented by the head of a man and the body of a serpent.  Hea,\nthe great goddess to whom water, the original principle, is\nsacred, and who is suspiciously connected with Noah, the\nlife-principle which appears at the close of a cycle, has changed\nher sex.  This god is now the “Ruler of the Seas,” “Master of the\nLife-Boat” (the ark), and “Lord of the Earth.”  The earth is his\nand the fulness thereof.  He is the “Life Giver,” the “Lord of\nHosts,” who subsequently becomes the maker of heaven and earth.",
        "Minerva, who had been the first emanation from the Deity and the\ndaughter of the Great Mother of the Gods, now has a father but no\nmother.  Jove, who in course of time came to be represented as a\nmale Creator, brought her forth from his head.  Later, woman is\nproduced from the side of man.  The male principle, symbolized by\na serpent, has become “the one only and true God.”  It is Passion\n–the “Healer of Nations\"–the great “I Am.”",
        "No unprejudiced individual who carefully follows the results of\nlater investigation, and who attempts to unravel the mysteries\nsurrounding the ancient gods and the significance of the symbols\nof worship belonging to the earliest historic times, will fail to\nnote the attempt which has been made in later ages to conceal the\nfact that the Deity worshipped in very ancient times was female. \nNeither will he fail to observe the modus operandi by which the\nattributes and prerogatives of this Deity have been shifted upon\nmales–usually deified monarchs.  After priestcraft and its\ncounterpart, monarchial rule, had robbed the people of all their\nnatural rights, kings assumed not alone the governing functions,\nbut arrogated to themselves the symbols, titles, and attributes\nof the dual Deity.  The reigning monarch became not only the\ntemporal ruler and priest, but was actually God himself, the\nfemale principle being concealed under convenient symbols.",
        "Not only were religious doctrines veiled beneath allegories and\nconvenient symbols, but names also had a religious significance.",
        "We are given to understand that in Chaldea and Assyria every\nchild was named by the oracle or priest, and that no one thought\nof changing the appellation which had come to him through this\nheavenly source.[79]",
        "[79] Inman, Ancient Faiths, vol. i., p. 3.",
        "Inman, in his Ancient Faiths, calls attention to the fact that in\nthe Old Testament kings, priests, captains, and other great men\nhave had names bestowed upon them, each of which has some\nreligious signification; that this name was given the individual\n\"at circumcision, or soon after birth.”",
        "In the ancient names of what are designated as the Shemitic\nraces, children were called after the god alone, and sometimes in\nconnection with an attribute.  Especially were these names\napplied to royalty or to persons of distinction; for instance,\nnames were given signifying, God the good, God the just or the\nmerciful, God the strong, The Warrior God, etc.",
        "As the higher conception of a Creator was forgotten, and as human\nbeings, or perhaps I should say their power to control\ncircumstances coupled with the ability to reproduce or create,\nhad become god, they assumed the titles or names of the Deity;\nhence, it is not perhaps singular that in later times kings and\nheroes were invested with all the attributes of the gods.",
        "We have seen that according to various writers Om or Amm was the\nholy one whose name in India it was sacrilege to pronounce.  It\nwas the eternal sun, or the Great Mother.  As this word stands\nalso for “tribe or people,” it seems to mean, too, that which\nbinds, holds, or endures.",
        "As Om or Amm signifies the Great Mother, so An or On means the\nGreat Father.  Concerning the word Am-mon, Inman writes as\nfollows:",
        "“The association of the words signifying mother and father\nindicates that it is to such conjunction we must refer creative\npower.  With such an androgyne element the sun was associated by\nancient mythologists.  Jupiter was himself sometimes represented\nas being female; and the word hermaphrodite is in itself a union\nbetween Hermes and Aphrodite, the male and female creative\npowers.  We may fairly conclude, from the existence of names like\nthe above, that there was at one time in Western as there was in\nEastern Asia a strong feud between the adorers of On and Am, the\nLingacitas and the Yonijas, and that they were at length\npartially united under Ammon, as they were elsewhere under Nebo\nor the Nabhi of Vishnu.\"[80]",
        "[80] Ancient Faiths Embodied in Ancient Names, vol. i., p. 237.",
        "Inman relates that once when a friend of his was conversing with\na very high-caste Hindoo he casually uttered this word Amm or Om,\nwhereupon the man was so awe struck that he could scarcely speak,\nand, in a voice almost of terror, asked where his friend had\nlearned the word.  Of this word Inman says:",
        "“To the Hindoos it was that incommunicable name of the Almighty,\nwhich no one ventured to pronounce except under the most\nreligious solemnity.  And here let me pause to remark that the\nJews were equally reverent with the name belonging to the Most\nHigh; and that the third commandment was very literal in its\nsignification.”",
        "The same writer remarks that in Thibet, too, where a worship very\nnearly identical in ceremony and doctrine with that of the Roman\npapists exists amongst the Lamas, the name of Om is still sacred.",
        "The Iav of the Jews was equally revered, but in the later ages of\ntheir career they seem to have lost sight of its true meaning.",
        "According to Inman’s testimony and that of other etymological\nstudents, the true signification of the cognomen Jacob is the\nfemale principle.",
        "It is believed by various writers that the story of Jacob and\nEsau as related in Genesis has an esoteric as well as an exoteric\nmeaning–that Jacob has reference to the female creative energy\nthroughout Nature, or, rather, to the great mass of people who in\nan early age of the human race believed in the superior\nimportance of the female in the office of reproduction, and that\nEsau signifies the male.  Attention is called to the fact that\nEsau is represented as a “hairy” man, rough-voiced and easily\nbeguiled, while Jacob, on the other hand, is smooth-faced,\nsoft-voiced, and the favorite of his mother.",
        "There is indeed much in this myth which seems to indicate that it\nis an allegory beneath which are veiled certain facts connected\nwith the struggle between two early contending sects regarding\nthe relative importance of the sexes in reproduction.  Of this\nInman says:",
        "“My own impression is that Esau, or Edom, and Jacob are mystic\nnames for a man and a woman, and that round these, historians\nwove a web of fancy; that ultimately the cognomen Jacob was\nrecognized, and that to allow the Jewish people to trace their\ndescent from a male rather than a female, the appellation of\nIsrael was substituted in later productions.\"[81]",
        "[81] Ancient Faiths, vol. i., p. 607.",
        "As most of the myths or allegories in Genesis are now traced to a\nsource far more remote than the beginning of legitimate Jewish\nhistory, it is not unreasonable to suppose that this story, too,\nwas copied by the Jews from the traditions of earlier races; nor,\nwhen we remember the true meaning of the cognomen Jacob, that the\nentire story should be regarded as an attempt to set forth\ncertain facts connected with the great physiological or religious\nconflict between the sexes.",
        "The significance of the idols worshipped by Jacob and his family\nis not for a certainty known, but it is believed by certain\nwriters that the Seraphim and Teraphim were the usual images\nwhich were used to represent the male and female energies.  “Then\nJacob said unto his household and to all that were with him:  Put\naway the strange gods that are among you.”  In referring to this\npassage, Inman, in a note, says:",
        "“The critic might fairly say, looking at Genesis xxxv., 2, ’Put\naway the strange gods that are among you,’ that there were images\nof God which were not strange, and that in these early times\nthere were orthodoxy and heterodoxy in images as there are now. \nIn ancient times the emblem of life-giving energy was an orthodox\nemblem; it is now a horror and its place is taken by an image of\ndeath.  We infer from the context that Laban’s gods were\northodox.”",
        "So, also, must have been the stone pillar set up by Jacob at\nBethel (place of the sun).  From a study of similar stones,\nexamples of which are to be found in nearly every country of the\nglobe, it is known that they represent the male energy, and from\nall the facts connected with the story of Laban’s gods it is\nprobable that they were emblems of this power.  We may suppose\nthen that the “strange gods,” the unorthodox gods, which Jacob\nordered put away, were those representing the female energy.",
        "It seems strange that any person can study the history of the\nIsraelitish Exodus by the light of later developments in biblical\nresearch without recognizing the fact that the “Lord” which\nbrought the children of Israel out from the bondage of Egypt was\nthe male power, which by a certain sect had been proclaimed the\nonly actual creative agency, and therefore the “only one and true\nGod.”",
        "Although, at the time at which Abraham is said to have lived, the\nknowledge of an abstract dual or triune God still remained, yet,\nduring the five hundred years which elapsed until the time of\nMoses, the grossest idolatry had come to prevail. \nNotwithstanding the fact that Moses had learned much from the\nEgyptians, he seems not to have risen above a very gross\nconception of a deity.  His god was by turns angry, jealous,\nrevengeful, vacillating, and weak.  He was in fact the embodiment\nof human passions and desires.  We have seen that the third\nperson in the ancient Trinity had, in Egypt, India, and Persia,\ncome to be recognized in place of the three principles originally\nworshipped–that, as it really embodied the essence of the other\ntwo, little was heard of the Creator and Preserver.  Doubtless\nthis God was the one which Moses intended the Israelites to\nworship, but as they were unable to conceive of an abstract\nprinciple he invested it with a personality which, as we have\nseen, was burdened with the frailties and weaknesses common to\nthemselves.",
        "As the Regenerator or Destroyer represented the processes of\nNature,–the dying away of the sun’s rays at night only to\nreappear on the following day, and the withdrawal of its warmth\nin winter only to be renewed in the spring,–so this God\nportrayed also the beneficent Creator and Preserver of all\nthings, at the same time that it was the Destroyer.  It embodied\nthe fundamental idea in all religions, namely, life and\nfertility.  So also did the “Lord” of the Israelites represent\nreproductive energy, but as man being spirit had come to be a\nCreator of offspring, while woman being only matter furnished the\nbody, this “Lord” was male.  Connected with it was no hint of the\nfemale nature or principle, except the ark or chest in which it\nwas carried about.  To those who have acquainted themselves with\nthe significance of ancient religious symbols, the fact is plain\nthat the “Lord” of the Israelites, which in their journeyings\ntoward Canaan they carried in an ark or chest, and which was\nsymbolized by an upright stone, was none other than a\n\"Life-giver” in the most practical sense.  It was the emblem of\nvirility, and from the facts at hand, at the present time, there\nis little doubt but that all the spirituality with which we find\nthis “Lord” invested was an after-thought and comprehended no\npart of the belief of the Jews until after their contact with the\nPersians during the Babylonian captivity.",
        "Doubtless the story in which their journeyings toward Canaan are\nset forth contains an esoteric as well as an exoteric\nsignificance for ages known only to the priests, and that within\nit is embodied not alone something of the true history of this\npeople, but an account also of their struggle against an older\nreligion.  At this time the Israelites had practically commenced\nthe elimination of the female principle from their god-idea, and\nhad begun the worship of the male element, the female being\nrepresented by an ark, chest, or box.  This ark, as the\nreceptacle of the god, was still a holy thing.",
        "Not only among the Israelites, but among other nations of the\nEast, we find the devotees of the male god beginning to assume a\nposition quite independent of the beliefs of their fathers.  At\nthis time great towers or pillars begin to be erected in honor of\nthis deity, which is figured as the “God of Life,” or as the\n\"Lord of Hosts.”  Notwithstanding the fact that the story of the\nExodus contains much historical truth, it is altogether probable\nthat the priests have used it, as they did that of the flood, to\nconceal their religious doctrines.",
        "At the time of the Exodus, the Israelites were ignorant tribes\nwithout laws or letters, and while in Egypt were menials of the\nlowest order.  Hence, the laws written on the two tables of\nstone, and which it is claimed were elaborated during their\nwanderings in the wilderness of Sinai for the guidance of these\nunlettered slaves, show the desire of the priests of later times\nto invest the “chosen people” with the insignia of enlightenment.",
        "Regarding the character of the god which they worshipped, we have\nample proof in the Old Testament.  It is plain that at the time\nof their bondage in Egypt the Jews had become the grossest\nphallic worshippers, adoring the emblems of generation, with no\nthought of their earlier significance as pure symbols of creative\nforce in mortals.",
        "The fact will doubtless be remembered that, among the Jews, to be\nbarren was the greatest curse, and that the principal reward\npromised to the faithful was fruitfulness of body.  The essence\nof this deity was heat or passion, and his emblem was the serpent\nor an upright stone.  It has been observed that when this “Lord\"\nwas invested with personality he was subject to all the frailties\nof his followers.  His chief and most emphatic characteristic,\nhowever, was jealousy of other gods, and most of the imprecations\nthundered against the chosen people were directed against the\nworship of the gods of surrounding nations, those which the\nIsraelites had originally worshipped.",
        "That portion of the Decalogue relating to a jealous god is seen\nto belong wholly to the Jews, or to the Israelites, who were\ndescendants of Jacob.  The older nations, among which was the\nancient family of the Hebrews, knew nothing of a jealous god. \nNotwithstanding the fact that the God of the Jews appeared and\ntalked face to face with Moses, that he exhibited portions of his\nbody to him, and that he thundered his law to this people from\nMt.  Sinai, still they were constantly lapsing into the worship\nof Baal and Ashtaroth, which fact shows how deeply rooted was the\nbelief in a dual or triune God.  It is plain that this “Lord,\"\nthe fierce anger of whom was kindled because of their\ndigressions, was none other than the jealous male god which had\nbut recently been elevated to the dignity of a supreme Creator.",
        "Although the angel of the Lord when he came down from Gilgal\ncommanded his followers to “throw down the altars of the people\nof Bochim,” they nevertheless continued to do evil in the sight\nof the Lord, and",
        "“followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round\nabout them, and bound themselves unto them and provoked the Lord\nto anger.",
        "“And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.  And\nthe anger of the Lord was hot against Israel.\"[82]",

        "“If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy\ndaughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as\nthine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve\nother gods, which thou hast not known thou nor thy fathers:",

        "The constantly recurring faithlessness of the Jews, their\nrestlessness and proneness to wander from their one-principled\ndeity which had been set up by their priests for them to worship,\nwas doubtless an unconscious effort on the part of the people to\nmitigate the outrage which had been committed against their\nCreator.  It was but a reaching out for that lost or unrecognized\nelement which comprehends the more essential force both in human\nbeings and in the conception of a deity.  In other words, it was\nan attempt at recognition, in the objects worshipped, of that\nmissing female element which had always been worshipped, and\nwithout which a Creator becomes a misnomer–a meaningless,\nunexplained, and unexplainable monstrosity.",
        "When the Jews first make their appearance in history, they are\nsun worshippers, as are all the nations by which they are\nsurrounded.  They are worshippers of Seth the Destroyer and\nRegenerator; but when the philosophical truths underlying the\nancient universal religion were forgotten, or when through\nignorance the language setting forth these mysteries was taken\nliterally, Seth became identified with the Destroyer, or the Evil\nPrinciple.  In the meantime man had come to believe himself the\nsole creator of offspring.  He is spirit, which is eternal; woman\nis matter, which is not only destructible but altogether evil. \nHe is heat or passion–the principle through which life is\nproduced.  She represents the absence of heat.  She is the simoom\nof the desert and the chilly blast which destroys.",
        "That it was no part of their plan to change their original form\nof worship for a spiritual conception of a Creator is apparent\nfrom their history.  On the contrary, it is plain that they\ndesired simply to eliminate from the hitherto dual conception of\na deity the female principle, which, in their arrogance, and\nbecause of the change which had been wrought in the relations of\nthe sexes, they no longer acknowledged as important in the office\nof reproduction.",
        "It is quite true they would worship only one god–the\n\"Lord,\"–but that lord was, as we have seen, a deity of physical\nstrength and virile might, a “Lord of Hosts,” a god which was to\nbe worshipped under the symbol of an upright stone–an object\nwhich by every nation of the globe down to a comparatively recent\ntime has typified male pro-creative energy.  That the masses of\nthe people, even as late as the time of Jeremiah, had no higher\nconception of a God than that indicated by an upright stone, is\nshown by that prophet when he accuses the entire house of Israel,\n\"their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their\nprophets,” of “saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a\nstone, Thou hast brought me forth.”",

        "That the above represents a quarrel in which the women of Judah\nopenly rebelled against the worship of the “Lord,” at the same\ntime declaring their allegiance to the female Deity, the\nCelestial Mother, Queen of Heaven, is only too evident, the curse\npronounced upon them by Jeremiah, in the name of the lord, having\nlittle effect upon them to change their purpose.",
        "“Therefore, hear ye the word of the Lord, all Judah that dwell in\nthe land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith\nthe Lord, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any\nman of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord God\nliveth.",

        "The name of one of the oldest deities of which we have any record\nis Set (Phoenician) or Seth (Hebrew).  Traces of this God are\nfound in all oriental countries; and in the most primitive\nreligions, whose traditions are still extant, he (or she) appears\nas the supreme God.  After the subjection of Egypt by the\nstranger kings and the consequent introduction into the country\nof Sabianism, the dual creative force residing in the sun is\nrepresented by Seth.  We are told that Seth signifies “appointed\nor put in the place of the murdered Abel.”",
        "That there is some deep mystery connected with this subject none\nwho has studied it carefully can help observing.",
        "According to the story of creation as set forth in the Jehovistic\naccount, on Saturday night, after God had finished his work, and\nimmediately after he had commanded Adam to “be fruitful,” he\npresents him with a staff, which we observe is handed down to\nEnoch and all the patriarchs.  Here the mystery deepens, for it\nis declared that this staff was presented so Seth, and that it\nwas a branch of the Tree of Life.",
        "That beneath this allegory is veiled a contest, or perhaps a\ncompromise, between the worshippers of two distinct sects, seems\naltogether probable.  That the handing down of this branch of the\nTree of Life, first to Adam, or man, by Aleim, and its subsequent\ntransference to Seth, the God of Nature, the Destroyer or\nRegenerator, seems to indicate a victory for the adherents of a\npurer religion.  The translator of Kallimachus says: “It is well\nknown to the learned reader that the descendants of Cain are\ndistinguished in Scripture by the name of the sons of man or\nAdam; those of Seth by the name of the sons of God.”  Gen.  vi.,\n2.[85] It is stated in Julius Africanus that all the righteous\nmen and patriarchs down to the Saviour himself have sprung from\nSeth and have been denominated as the sons of God in\ncontradistinction to the sons of man.",
        "[85] Forlong, Rivers of Life, vol. i., p. 527.",
        "Doubtless at the time indicated by the transference of the\ncreative agency from Aleim to Adam, the worship of an abstract\nprinciple, or of a Trinity composed of the powers of Nature, was\nlosing its hold on the minds of the people, and the creative\npower, or the reproductive energy in human beings, was rapidly\ntaking the place of the older Deity.  These higher principles\nforgotten, Adam, or man, had become the Creator.",
        "It is not improbable that the terms Adam, Cain, Abel, and Seth\nhave an esoteric meaning which for ages was known only to the\npriests.  From various facts which in later times are being\nbrought forward regarding the ancient myths of Genesis, it is\nbelieved that these names originally stood for races of men, and\nthat subsequently certain religious doctrines came to be attached\nto them.  The offering of fruit by Cain, the elder brother, who\nwas a tiller of the ground, and that of flesh by Abel, who was a\nkeeper of sheep, indicates a quarrel which ended in the death of\nthe latter.  After the death of Abel, or after one of these\nprinciples or sects was subdued, the older religion was revived,\nand Seth, as the Aleim, or as the creative power within the sun,\nwas “appointed” or again worshipped.",
        "It would seem that Seth was appointed to represent the third\nperson in the ancient Trinity–the Destroyer or Regenerator which\nhad previously come to embody all the powers of the Creator and\nPreserver.  The fact has been observed that the very ancient\nphilosophers believed matter to be eternal, hence, seeming death,\nor destruction, was necessary to renewed life or regeneration. \nIn other words, creation was but continuous change in the form of\nmatter.",
        "Of the doctrines of the Sethians extant at the beginning of\nChristianity, Hippolytus says that their system “is made up of\ntenets from natural philosophers.  These tenets embrace a belief\nin the Eternal Logos–Darkness, Mist, and Tempest.”  These\nelements subsequently became identified with the Evil Principle,\nor the Devil.  The cold of winter, the darkness of night, and\nwater, were finally set forth as the Trinity.  Regarding cold,\ndarkness, and water, or darkness, mist, and tempest, Hippolytus\nobserves:",
        "“These the Sethian says are the three principles of our system;\nor when he states that three were born in paradise– Adam, Eve,\nthe serpent; or when he speaks of three persons, namely, Cain,\nAbel, Seth, and again of three others, Shem, Ham, Japheth; or\nwhen he mentions three patriarchs–Abraham, Isaac, Jacob; or when\nhe speaks of three days before the sun, etc.”",

The simoom\nof the desert and the cold of winter were Seth, as were also the\ngenial powers of Spring.  We are informed by various writers that\nTyphon Seth was feminine.

        "Although the secret meaning of all the allegories contained in\nthe Old Testament is not fully understood, still the belief that\nCain, Abel, and Seth represented the self-triplicated Deity at a\ntime when the idea of man as a creator had been accepted, or when\nhis power to reproduce was becoming the highest idea of a\ncreative force, is consistent with what is known of the Cabala of\nthe Jews, or of the esoteric meaning of the Jewish scriptures\nformerly known only to the priests.  In other words, the ancient\ndoctrines, the true meaning of which was no longer understood by\nthem, were patched together as a basis for the later developments\nin Jewish religious experience.",
        "We have seen that six hundred years after Adam appears Noah,\nanother self-triplicated Saviour or preserver of man, with his\nark or seed vessel, beneath which is veiled the female element. \nAfterward Abraham becomes the Great Father or Saviour, and later\nMoses.  That, in the time of the latter, the more ancient worship\nof a creative force in Nature represented by the Aleim, had, by\nthe masses of the people, been wholly lost, is evident from the\nOld Testament writings.  The worship of the Father, the male\npower, in opposition to that of the Mother, or the female power,\nconstituted the religion of Moses.  In the religion of the Jews,\nJehovah came to be regarded as wholly male and as spirit, while\nEdam (translated “downward tending”), the female principle, was\nmatter, or woman, which finally became identified with the Devil.",
        "The philosophical doctrine that spirit is evolved through matter,\nor that matter must be raised to a certain dynamical power before\nspirit can manifest itself through it, was no longer understood;\nonly the husks of this doctrine –the myths and symbols of\nNature-worship–remained; these were taken literally, and thus\nman’s religion was made to conform to his lowered estate.",
        "When man had so far gained the ascendancy over woman as to assert\nthat he is the sole Creator of their joint offspring, he was no\nlonger of the earth earthy, but at once became the child of\nheaven.  He was, however, bound to earth through his association\nwith matter, or with woman, from whom he was unable to free\nhimself.  The “sons of God” were united “to the daughters of\nman.”  Jahvah, the “God of hosts,” who was revengeful, weak,\njealous, and cruel, was worshipped in the place of Aleim the\ngreat dual force throughout Nature.  The ethereal, spiritual male\nessence resided somewhere in the heavens and created from afar,\nwhile the earth (female) furnished only the body or material\nsubstance.",

        "Seth or Typhon was for ages worshipped throughout Egypt, and as\nshe comprehended the powers of Nature, or the creative energy\nresiding in the sun and earth, little is heard of any other god. \nStrange it is, however, that Seth is worshipped more in her\ncapacity as Destroyer than as Regenerator.  So soon as we\nunderstand the origin and character of the Devil, and so soon as\nwe divest ourselves of the false ideas which under a state of\nignorance and gross sensuality came to prevail relative to the\n\"powers of darkness,” we shall perceive that his (or her) Satanic\nmajesty was once a very respectable personage and a powerful\nDivinity–a Divinity which was worshipped by a people whose\nsuperior intelligence can scarcely be questioned.

        "“Persons who have not given much consideration to these subjects\nwill be apt to wonder that any people should be found to offer\nadoration to the evil principle; but they do not consider that,\nin all these recondite systems, the evil principle, or the\nDestroyer, or Lord of Death, was at the same time the\nRegenerator.  He could not destroy but to reproduce, and it was\nprobably not till this principle began to be forgotten, that the\nevil being, per se, arose; for in some nations this effect seems\nto have taken place.  Thus Baal-Zebub is, in Iberno Celtic, Baal\nLord, and Zab Death, Lord of Death; but he is also called Aleim,\nthe same as the God of the Israelites; and this is right, because\nhe was one of the Trimurti or Trinity.",
        "“If I be correct respecting the word Aleim being feminine, we\nhere see the Lord of Death of the feminine gender; but the\nGoddess Ashtaroth or Astarte, the Eoster of the Germans, was also\ncalled Aleim.  Here again Aleim is feminine, which shows that I\nam right in making Aleim the plural feminine.  Thus we have\ndistinctly found Aleim the Creator (Gen. i., 1), Aleim the\nPreserver, and Aleim the Destroyer, and this not by inference,\nbut literally expressed.\"[87]",

Seth, the Destroyer, had been deposed, but, so deeply\nrooted in the human mind had become the idea of a female Creator,\nthat Isis, the Queen of Heaven, a somewhat lower conception of\nMuth, or of universal womanhood, soon assumed the place of Seth\nbeside Osiris.  Later in the history of Egypt, when the gods have\nbecome greatly multiplied, and the original significance of the\ndeity obscured, Horus, the child and the third member in the\nlater Egyptian triad, not unfrequently appears in her place as\none of the eight great gods.",

        "The ancient philosophical truth that matter is eternal, and that\nthe destruction of vegetable life through the agency of cold was\none of the necessary processes of re-generation, or the renewal\nof life, had evidently been lost sight of at the time when Seth\nwas dethroned in Egypt.  Wilkinson informs us that “both Seth and\nOsiris were adored until a change took place respecting Seth,\nbrought about apparently by foreign influence.”  Sethi or Sethos,\na ruler whose reign represents the Augustan age of Egyptian\nsplendor, received his name from this Deity.  It is said that\nduring the twentieth dynasty Seth is suddenly portrayed as the\nprinciple of evil “with which is associated sin.”  Consequently\nall the effigies of this great Goddess were destroyed and all her\nnames and inscriptions “which could be reached” were effaced.",
        "Bunsen tells us that Schelling, who has made a study of Egyptian\nmythology, although totally ignorant of the later historical\nfacts which by means of hieroglyphical monuments have been\nobtained, had arrived at the conclusion that Seth had occupied an\nimportant position in the Deity down to the fourteenth century\nB.C.  “Schelling had on mere speculative grounds been brought to\nlay down as a postulate that Typhon, at some early period, had\nbeen considered by the Egyptians as a beneficent and powerful\nGod.”",
        "Wilkinson says that the character given to Seth, who was called\nBaal-Seth and the God of the Gentiles, “is explained by his being\nthe cause of evil.”  We are assured that formerly “Sin the great\nserpent, or Apophis the giant, was distinct from Seth who was a\ndeity and a part of the divine system.  But after the recondite\nprinciples underlying sun-worship were lost or forgotten; when\ncold and darkness, or the sinking away of the sun’s rays, which\nare necessary to the reappearance of light and warmth, came to be\nregarded as the destructive element, or the evil principle, woman\nbecame identified with this principle.  She was the producer of\nevil, and came to be represented in connection with a serpent as\nthe cause of all earthly or material things.  She is Destruction,\nbut not Regeneration.  She is in fact matter.  The cold of winter\nand the darkness of night, which are necessary to the return of\nthe sun’s warmth and which were formerly set forth as a\nbeneficent mother who brings forth the sun, became only the evil\nprinciple–that which obscures the light.  In fact Darkness or\nabsence of the sun’s heat has become the Devil.  It is the “cause\nof evil in the world.”",

        "There is no doubt but this doctrine was the legitimate outcome of\nthe decay of female influence.  Through the further stimulation\nof the lower nature of man its absurdity gradually increased,\nuntil under the system calling itself Christian it finally\nreached its height.  This subject will be referred to later in\nthese pages.",
        "When we remember that the original representation of the Deity\namong the nations of the earth consisted of a female figure\nembracing a child, and when we observe that subsequently in the\ndevelopment of the god-idea woman appears associated with a\nserpent as the cause of evil in the world, the history of the God\nSeth, who, as we have seen, represented the processes of Nature,\nnamely Destruction and Regeneration, seems quite significant as\nindicating some of the actual processes involved in this change.",

        "So long as human beings worshipped the abstract principle of\ncreation, the manifestations of which proceed from the earth and\nsun, they doubtless reasoned little on the nature of its hitherto\ninseparable parts.  They had not at that early period begun to\nlook outside of Nature for their god-idea, but when through the\npeculiar course of development which had been entered upon, the\nsimple conception of a creative agency originally entertained\nbecame obscured, mankind began to speculate on the nature and\nattributes of the two principles by which everything is produced,\nand to dispute over their relative importance in the office of\nreproduction.  Much light has been thrown upon these speculations\nby the Kosmogonies which have come down to us from the\nPhoenicians, Babylonians, and other peoples of past ages.  In the\nPhoenician Kosmogony, according to the Mokh doctrine as recorded\nby Philo, out of the kosmic egg Toleeleth (female) “sprang all\nthe impregnation of creation and the beginning of the universe.” \nIn this exposition of the beginnings of things, it is distinctly\nstated that the spirit which in after ages came to be regarded as\nsomething outside or above Nature, “had no consciousness of its\nown creation.”  Commenting on the above, Bunsen is constrained to\nadmit that it is usually understood as being “decidedly\npantheistic.”  He suggests, however, that the writer may HAVE\nINTENDED TO SAY (the italics are mine) that “the spirit who was\nheretofore the Creator was the unconscious spirit.”",
        "Berosus, the scholar of Babylon, who, until a comparatively\nrecent time has furnished all the information extant concerning\nBabylonian antiquities, in his account of the creation of man and\nof the universe, says that in the beginning all was water and\ndarkness; that in the water were the beginnings of life; but as\nyet there was no order.  Men were there with the wings of birds\nand even with the feet of beasts.  There were also quadrupeds and\nmen with fishes’ tails, all of which had been produced by a\ntwofold principle.  Over this incongruous mass a woman presided. \nThis woman is called Omoroka by the Babylonians and by the\nChaldeans Thalatth.  The  latter name, signifies, “bearing” or\n\"egg producing.”",
        "In the Babylonian Kosmogony, according to Endemus, the pupil of\nAristotle, the beginning of the universe was called Tauthe, which\nbeing interpreted means “Mother of the Gods.”  Associated with\nher sometimes appears the male principle–Apason.  In the history\nof Berosus, there is given an account of Oaunes–a mythical\nteacher of Babylon, who appeared with the head of a human being\nand the body of a fish or serpent.  This personage brought to the\nBabylonians all the knowledge which they possessed.  Oaunes wrote\n\"concerning the generation of mankind, of their different ways of\nlife, and of their civil polity.”  He it was who gave the above\naccount of creation.  He says that finally Omoroka, or Thalatth,\nthe woman who existed before the creation, was divided, one half\nof her forming the heavens, “the other half the earth.”  “All\nthis,” Berosus declares, “was an allegorical description of\nNature.\"[93]",

        "In the following legend will be observed the groundwork for the\nstory of the flood.  Xisuthrus was a king of Chaldea.  To him the\ndeity, Kronos, appeared in a vision and warned him that upon the\nfifteenth day of the month Daesius there would be a flood, by\nwhich mankind would be destroyed.  He therefore enjoined him to\nwrite a history of the beginning, progress, and conclusion of all\nthings down to the present time, and to bury it in Sippara, the\nCity of the Sun.  He was commanded also to build a vessel, and\ntake with him into it his friends and relations, and to convey on\nboard everything necessary to sustain life, together with all the\ndifferent animals, both birds and quadrupeds, and trust himself\nfearlessly to the deep. Having asked the deity whither he was to\nsail, he was answered: “To the gods\"; upon which he offered up a\nprayer for the good of mankind.  He then obeyed the divine\nadmonition, and built a vessel five stadia in length and two in\nbreadth.  Into this he put everything which he had prepared, and\nlast of all conveyed into it his wife, his children, and his\nfriends.",
        "“After the flood had been upon the earth, and was in time abated,\nXisuthrus sent out birds from the vessel, which not finding any\nfood, nor any place whereupon they might rest their feet,\nreturned to him again.  After an interval of some days, he sent\nthem forth a second time; and they now returned with their feet\ntinged with mud.  He made a trial a third time with these birds;\nbut they returned to him no more: from which he judged that the\nsurface of the earth had appeared above the waters.  He therefore\nmade an opening in the vessel, end upon looking out found that it\nwas stranded upon the side of some mountain, upon which he\nimmediately quitted it with his wife, his daughter, and the\npilot.  Xisuthrus then paid his adoration to the earth: and,\nhaving constructed an altar, offered sacrifices to the gods, and,\nwith those who had come out of the vessel with him, disappeared. \nHim they saw no more, but they could distinguish his voice in the\nair, and could hear him admonish them to pay due regard to the\ngods.  He informed them that it was on account of his piety that\nhe had been taken away to live with the gods, and that his wife\nand daughter had obtained the same honor.”",
        "It is more than likely that this story, which as we have seen has\nextended to the remotest corners of the earth, has an esoteric\nmeaning, and that it embodies the doctrines of the ancients\nrelative to re- incarnation and the renewal of worlds.  Doubtless\nit portrays not only the end of a cycle, but that by it is\nprefigured the fortunes of a human soul, which in its ascent, is\nfrom time to time forced into a human body.",
        "All the early Kosmogonies are intermingled with the history of a\ngreat flood, from the ravages of which an ark which contained a\nman was saved.  The Gothic story of creation indicates that the\nScythians belonged to the same race as the Chaldeans.  At the\nbeginning of time when nothing had been formed, and before the\nearth, the sea, or the heavens appeared, Muspelsheim existed.  A\nbreath of heat passing over the vapors, melted them into water,\nand from this water was formed a cow named Aedumla, who was the\nprogenitor of Odin, Vile, and Ve, the Trinity of the Gothic\nnation.",
        "There is also another tradition, probably a later, which asserts\nthat from the drops of water produced by the primeval breath of\nheat, a man, Ymer, was brought forth.  The son of Ymer was\npreserved in a storm-tossed bark, his father being dragged into\nthe middle of the abyss, where, from his body the earth was\nproduced.  The sea was made of his blood, the mountains of his\nbones, and the rocks of his teeth.  As three of his descendants\nwere walking on the shore one day, they found two pieces of wood\nwhich had been washed up by the waves.  Of these they made a man\nand a woman.  The man they named Aske and the woman Emla.  From\nthis pair has descended the human race.",

        "“They are indeed evidently the same person, not only in point of\ncharacter, but, if I mistake not, in appellation: for Ymer or\nUmer is Omer-Oca expressed in a more simple form.  The difference\nof sex does by no means invalidate this opinion, which rests upon\nthe perfect identity of their characters: for the Great Mother,\nlike the Great Father, was an hermaphrodite; or, rather, that\nperson from whom all things were supposed to be produced, was the\nGreat Father and the Great Mother united together in one compound\nbeing.  Ymer and Omoroca are each the same as that hermaphrodite\nJupiter of the Orphic theology.”",

According to one\nGerman tradition, Tiw (Zeus), which in its earliest conception\nwas female, was the parent of the first man.  This man begat\nthree sons who became the fathers of the three Deutsch tribes. \nIsh (or Ash) was the parent of the Franks and Allemans; Ing was\nthe progenitor of the Swedes, Angles, and Saxons; and Er, or\nErman, was the eponymous leader of the tribes called by the\nRomans Hermiones.",

        "Colenso observes that verse four of chapter second belongs to the\nElohist, and that it was removed from its original position at\nthe beginning of Gen. i., in order to form the commencement of\nthe Jehovistic account of the creation.[95]",

        "According to Higgins, the first verse of the first chapter of\nGenesis, if properly translated, would not declare that in the\nbeginning God created the heavens and the earth, but that Wisdom\n\"formed” the earth and the planets.  In none of the ancient\nKosmogonies can there be a word found regarding the creation of\nmatter.  From the facts which have come down to us respecting the\nspeculations of the ancients, it is plain that the original\nconception was, that within the primeval beginnings described in\ntheir Kosmogonies, in chaos or unorganized matter, was contained\nprimeval force; no attempt, however, was made by them to account\nfor the creation of either motion or matter.",
        "As soon as human beings began to speculate on the attributes of\ntheir Deity; when the two principles composing it began to\nseparate, and the idea was gaining ground that the male was the\nonly important factor in reproduction, the sun became male, the\nearth and sea female.  Still, even then the doctrine seems not to\nhave been questioned, that the creative agency had proceeded from\nmatter, or that it was developed in and through it.  The belief\nthat something can be made from nothing was reserved for a later\nage.",
        "In the oldest Semitic Kosmogonies, we are assured that the\nself-conscious God who is manifested in the order of the\nuniverse, proceeded out of the great abyss, and out of\nunorganized, dark, primeval matter.  During the earlier historic\nperiod, however, by both Jew and Gentile, the belief was\nentertained that spirit is material.  It is the essence of\nfire–a substance akin to the galvanic or electric fluid.  This\nmasculine element, the manifestation of which is desire, or heat,\nand which was finally set up as an eternal, self-existent,\ncreative force, or God, was originally regarded as a\nmanifestation of matter, and as having no independent existence. \nIn an earlier age, this so-called creative agency is associated\nwith a force far superior to itself, namely, Light or Wisdom. \nMinerva, who is the first emanation from the Deity, “formed” all\nthings.  She it is who discriminates all things and gives laws to\nthe universe.  “She represented to the Greeks that spiritual\nelement which lifts knowledge into wisdom, and talent into\ngenius.\"[97] But with the importance which began to be assumed by\nman when he began to regard himself as a creator, and when\nthrough ignorance and sensuality the principles of a more\nenlightened race were forgotten, desire, or heat, was separated\nfrom matter and came to be regarded as an independent entity,\nwhich itself had created matter out of nothing.  Thus is noticed\nthe extent to which the god-idea has been developed in\naccordance with the relative positions of the sexes.",

        "According to the Grecian mythology, much of which was a\ncomparatively late development, mortal woman was the handiwork of\nVulcan the Firegod, who, being commissioned by Jove to execute “a\nsnare for gods and man,” moulded the beauteous form of woman. \nThis is a worthy example of the contempt and scorn shown by the\nGreeks for women during the later period of their career as a\nnation.  That such contempt was a later development is shown in\nthe fact that woman was originally the gift of Pallas Athene, or\nWisdom.  When she first appeared on the scene she was crowned by\nthe gods, in fact she was the first object honored with a crown. \nConcerning the conceptions regarding women as held at an earlier\nage, and those which came to prevail after she had become “the\ncause of evil in the world,” we have the following from\nTertullian:",

        "Although earth, air, water, and the sun were long venerated as\nobjects of worship, as containing the life principle, in process\nof time it is observed that fire attracted the highest regard of\nhuman beings, and on their altars the sacred flame, said to have\nbeen kindled from heaven, was kept burning uninterruptedly from\nyear to year, and from age to age, by bends of priests “whose\nspecial duty it was to see that the sacred flame was never\nextinguished.”  The office of the vestal virgins in Rome was to\npreserve the holy fire.  The Egyptians, and in fact all the\nearlier civilized nations, knew that force proceeds from the sun,\nhence the frequent appearance of this orb among their symbols of\nlife.  Indeed there is not a country on the globe in which, at\nsome time, divine honors have not been paid to fire and to light.",
        "The Hindoos, “believing fire to be the essence of all active\npower in Nature, kept perpetual lamps burning in the innermost\nrecesses of their pagodas and temples, and in the sacred edifices\nof the Greeks and Barbarians fires were preserved for the same\nreason.”",
        "The festival of lamps, which was once universal throughout Egypt,\nstill prevails in China.  On the evening of the fifteenth day of\nthe first month in the year, every person is compelled to place\nbefore his door a lantern or light, such lights differing in size\nand expense according to the degree of wealth or poverty of those\nto whom they belong.  Light was the symbol of Muth (Perceptive\nWisdom).  Among the Persians, the Egyptians, the Mexicans, the\nJews, the Etruscans, the Greeks, and the Romans, fire was\nvenerated as the essence of the Deity; and, at the present time,\nin Thibet, in China, in Japan, and in portions of Africa, it\nstill forms an important part of worship. The Hebrew writings\nshow conclusively that not only the Jews but all the surrounding\nnations were fire-worshippers, and that their sacrifices were not\ninfrequently to the God of Fire.  Of this Forlong says:",

        "The real essence of fire which was identical with the\nlife-principle was holy.  The “Lord” of the Israelites was in the\nfire which descended on Mt. Sinai, Exodus xix., 18.  “The bush\nburned with fire and the bush was not consumed,” Exodus iii., 2. \nWhether the signification of “bush” is the same as “grove,” I\nknow not, but Josephus assures us that the bush was holy before\nthe flame appeared in it.  Because of its sacred character, it\nbecame the receptacle for the burning “Lord” of the Jews.  The\nark, the religious emblem which Moses bore aloft, was simply a\nfire altar on which the fire must continually burn.  The fact\nwill doubtless be observed that although the ark and the bush\n(female emblems) were invested with a certain degree of sanctity,\nthey were nevertheless only receptacles for the substance within\nthem.",
        "At the same time that the Jews kept sacred or holy fires\ncontinually burning on their altars, they carried about a serpent\non a pole representing it to be the “healer of nations.”  They\nalso kept a phallic emblem in a box, chest, or ark which they\nworshipped as the “God of Hosts,” the “Life Giver,” etc.  It has\nbeen observed that although the Jews frequently lost their ark,\nthey were never without their serpent-pole.  At a certain stage\nin the religious development of mankind all the temples in Africa\nand Western Asia were dedicated to Vulcan the fire god or the\n\"Lord of Fire,” to whom all furnaces were sacred.  The principal\nfestivals in honor of this Deity took place in the spring, at the\nEaster season, and on the 23d of August, when it is said that the\nlicentiousness practiced in the temples compared with those of\nthe “Harvest Homes” of Europe when the sun was in Libra and the\nharvest had been garnered in.

        "There is little doubt that in early historic ages the Persians,\nwho had undertaken to purify their religion, were the strongest\nand purest sect of this cult; they were in fact the genuine\nworshippers of the pure creative principles which they believed\nresided in fire.",
        "We have observed that force or spirit was originally regarded as\na part of Nature, or in other words that it was a manifestation\nof, or an outflowing from matter, but so soon as it began to be\nconsidered as something apart from Nature, there at once arose a\ndesire for some corporeal object to represent this unseen and\noccult principle.",
        "During many of the ages of fire-worship, holy fire, although a\nmaterial substance, seems to have been too subtle to clearly\nrepresent the god-idea, hence everywhere the worship of the\nserpent is found to be interwoven with it.  In fact, so closely\nare serpent, fire, pillar, and other phallic faiths intermingled\nthat it is impossible to separate them.",
        "The Persians are by some writers said to have been the earliest\nfire-worshippers: by others the truth of this statement is\ndenied, while many claim, and indeed the Maji themselves\ndeclared, that they never worshipped fire at all in any other\nmanner than as an emblem of the divine principle which they\nbelieved resided within it.  It is probable, however, from the\nevidence at hand, that they, like all the other nations of the\nglobe, prior to the reformation led by Zarathustra and his\ndaughter, had lost or nearly forgotten the profound ideas\nconnected with the worship of Nature.",
        "Passion, symbolized by fire, is declared by various writers to\nhave been the first idol, but later research has proved the\nfalsity of this assumption.  It is true that at an early age of\nhuman experience the creative processes were worshipped, but such\nworship involved scientific and, I might say, spiritualized\nconceptions of the operations of Nature which in time were\naltogether lost sight of.  Gross phallicism is clearly the result\nof degeneration, and of a lapse into sensuality and superstition.",
        "I think no one can study the facts connected with fire and light\nas the Deity in the various countries in which this worship\nprevailed, without perceiving the change it gradually underwent\nduring later ages, and the grossness of the ideas which became\nconnected with it as compared with an earlier age when mankind\n\"had no temples, but worshipped in the open air, on the tops of\nmountains.”",

Although until a comparatively recent period\ntheir true significance has been unknown, there is little doubt\nat the present time that they were originally used as symbols of\nfertility, or as emblems typifying the processes of Nature, and\nthat at some remote period of the world’s history they were\nworshipped as the Creator, or, at least, as representations of\nthe creative agencies in the universe.",

Our ideas of propriety, according to\nVoltaire, lead us to suppose that a ceremony (like the worship of\nPriapus) which appears to us infamous, could only be invented by\nlicentiousness; but it is impossible to believe that depravity of\nmanners would ever have led among any people to the establishment\nof religious ceremonies.  It is probable, on the contrary, that\nthis custom was first introduced in times of simplicity–that the\nfirst thought was to honor the Deity in the symbol of life which\nit has given us; such a ceremony may have excited licentiousness\namong youths, and have appeared ridiculous to men of education in\nmore refined, more corrupt, and more enlightened times, but it\nnever had its origin in such feelings.  .  .  .  It is out of the\nquestion therefore to suppose that a general prevalence of vice\nwould of itself, without the authority of priests and scriptures,\nsuffice to lead to the defilement of holy temples.\"[101]",

During the later ages of their\nhistory, at a time when their religion had degenerated into a\nlicensed system of vice and corruption, and after their temples\nhad become brothels in which, in the name of religion, were\npracticed the most debasing ceremonies, the Greeks became ashamed\nof their ancient worship, and, like the Jews, ashamed also of\ntheir name.",

Hence, to the many, the meaning of\nthe ancient doctrine was lost, and was communicated only to the\nfew, under the strictest secrecy in the mysteries of Eleusis and\nSamothrace.  Thus there was a popular theology to suit the\npeople, and a rational theology reserved for the educated, the\nsymbolical language in both being the same, but the meaning of it\nbeing taken differently.  In course of time, as knowledge makes\nits way among the people, and religious enlightenment with it,\nmuch of what had been received literally will relapse into its\noriginal figurative or symbolical meaning.

Even\namong the profligate Greeks, the mysteries of Eleusis, celebrated\nin the temple of Ceres, were always respected.  Care should be\ntaken, however, not to confound these remnants of pure Nature-\nworship with that of the courtesan Venus, whose adoration, during\nthe degenerate days of Greece, represented only the lowest and\nmost corrupt conception of the female energy.",
        "Down to a late date in the annals of Athens there was celebrated\na religious festival called Thesmophoria.  The name of this\nfestival is derived from one of the cognomens of Ceres–the\ngoddess “who first gave laws and made life orderly.”  Ceres was\nthe divinity adored by the Amazons, and is essentially the same\nas the Egyptian Isis.  She represents universal female Nature. \nThe Thesmophorian rites, which are believed by most writers to\nhave been introduced into Greece directly from Thrace, were\nperformed by “virgins distinguished for probity in life, who\ncarried about in procession sacred books upon their heads.”",
        "Inman, in his Ancient Faiths, quotes an oracle of Apollo, from\nSpencer, to the effect that “Rhea the Mother of the Blessed, and\nthe Queen of the Gods, loved assemblages of women.”  As this\nfestival is in honor of Female Nature, the various female\nattributes are adored as deities, Demeter being the first named\nby the worshippers.  After a long season of fasting, and “after\nsolemn reflection on the mysteries of life, women splendidly\nattired in white garments assemble and scatter flowers in honor\nof the Great Mother.”",
        "The food partaken of by the devotees at these festivals was\ncakes, very similar in shape to those which were offered to the\nQueen of Heaven by the women of Judah in the days of Jeremiah, an\noffering which it will be remembered so displeased that prophet\nthat a curse was pronounced upon the entire people.",
        "As the strictest secrecy prevailed among the initiated respecting\nthese rites, the exact nature of the symbols employed at the\nThesmophorian festivals is not known; it is believed, however,\nthat it was the female emblem of generation, and that this\nfestival was held in honor of that event which from the earliest\ntimes had been prophesied by those who believed in the superior\nimportance of the female, namely, that unaided by the male power,\na woman would bring forth, and that this manifestation of female\nsufficiency would forever settle the question of the ascendancy\nof the female principle.  Through a return of the ancient ideas\nof purity and peace, mankind would be redeemed from the\nwretchedness and misery which had been the result of the decline\nof female power.  The dual idea entertained in the Thesmophorian\nworship is observed in the fact that although Ceres, the Great\nMother, was the principal Deity honored, Proserpine, the child,\nwas also comprehended, and with its Mother worshipped as part of\nthe Creator.  Thus we observe that down to a late date in the\nhistory of Grecian mythology the idea of a Holy Mother with her\nchild had not altogether disappeared as a representation of the\ngod-idea.",

Both the Greeks and the Romans punished any insult\noffered to these mysteries with the most persevering\nvindictiveness.  Alcibiades was charged with insulting these\nreligious rites, and although the proof of his offense was quite\ndoubtful, yet he suffered for it for years in exile and misery,\nand it must be allowed that he was the most popular man of his\nage.\"[103]",

        "In Greece, the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries was in the\nhands of the Emolpidae, one of the oldest and most respected\nfamilies of antiquity.  At Carthage, there were celebrated the\nPhiditia, religious solemnities similar to those already\ndescribed in Greece.  During the two or three days upon which\nthese festivals were celebrated, public feasts were prepared at\nwhich the youth were instructed by their elders in the state\nconcerning the principles which were to govern their conduct in\nafter life; truth, inward purity, and virtue being set forth as\nessentials to true manhood.  In later times, after these\nfestivals had found their way to Rome, they gradually succumbed\nto the immorality which prevailed, and at last, when their former\nexalted significance had been forgotten, they were finally sunk\ninto “the licentiousness of enjoyment, and the innocence of mirth\nwas superseded by the uproar of riot and vice! Such were the\nSaturnalia.”",
        "From the facts connected with the mysteries of Eleusis and the\nThesmophorian rites, it is evident that in its earlier stages\nNature-worship was absolutely free from the impurities which came\nto be associated with it in later times.  As the organs of\ngeneration had not originally been wholly disgraced and outraged,\nit is not unlikely that when the so-called “sculptured\nindecencies” appeared on the walls of the temples they were\nregarded as no more an offense against propriety and decency than\nwas the reappearance of the cross, the emblem of life, in later\ntimes, among orthodox Christians.",
        "Neither is it probable, in an age in which nothing that is\nnatural was considered indecent, and before the reproductive\nenergies had become degraded, that these symbols were any more\nsuggestive of impurity than are the Easter offerings upon our\nchurch altars at the present time.  Whatever may now be the\nsignificance of these offerings to those who present them, sure\nit is that they once, together with other devices connected with\nNature-worship, were simply emblems of fertility–symbols of a\nrisen and fructifying sun which by its gladdening rays re-creates\nand makes all things new again.",
        "If we carefully study the religion of past ages we will discover\nsomething more than a hint of an age when the generative\nfunctions were regarded as a sacred expression of creative power,\nand when the reproductive organs had not through over-stimulation\nand abuse been tabooed as objects altogether impure and unholy,\nand as things too disgraceful to be mentioned above a whisper. \nIndeed there is much evidence going to show that in an earlier\nage of the world’s history the degradation of mankind, through\nthe abuse of the creative functions, had not been accomplished,\nand the ills of life resulting from such abuse were unknown.",
        "We may reasonably believe that those instincts in the female\nwhich are correlated with maternal affection and which were\nacquired by her as a protection to the germ, or, in other words,\nthose characters which Nature has developed in the female to\ninsure the safety and well-being of offspring, and which in a\npurer and more natural stage of human existence acted as cheeks\nupon the energies of the male, were not easily or quickly\nsubdued; but when through subjection to the animal nature of man\nthese instincts or characters had been denied their natural\nexpression, and woman had become simply the instrument of man’s\npleasure, the comparatively pure worship of the organs of\ngeneration as symbols of creative power began to give place to\nthe deification of these members simply as emblems of desire, or\nas instruments for the stimulation of passion.",
        "We are assured that on the banks of the Ganges, the very cradle\nof religion, are still to be found various remnants of the most\nancient form of Nature-worship–that there are still to be\nobserved “certain high places sacred to more primitive ideas than\nthose represented by Vedic gods.”",
        "Here devout worshippers believe that the androgynous God of\nfertility, or Nature, still manifests itself to the faithful. \nClose beside these more ancient shrines are others representing a\nsomewhat later development of religious faith–shrines, by means\nof which are indicated some of the processes involved in the\nearlier growth of the god-idea.  Not far removed from these are\nto be found, also, numerous temples or places of worship\nbelonging to a still later faith–a faith in which are revealed\nthe “awakening and stimulation of every sensuous feeling, and\nwhich has drowned in infamy every noble impulse developed in\nhuman nature.”",
        "Of the depravity of the Jews and the immorality practiced in\ntheir religious rites, Forlong says:",
        "“No one can study their history, liberated from the blindness\nwhich our Christian up-bringing and associations cast over us,\nwithout seeing that the Jews were probably the grossest\nworshippers among all those Ophi–Phallo–Solar devotees who then\ncovered every land and sea, from the sources of the Nile and\nEuphrates to all over the Mediterranean coasts and isles.  These\nimpure faiths seem to have been very strictly maintained by Jews\nup to Hezekiah’s days, and by none more so than by dissolute\nSolomon and his cruel, lascivious bandit-father, the\nbrazen-faced adulterer and murderer, who broke his freely\nvolunteered oath, and sacrificed six innocent sons of his king to\nhis Javah.”",
        "Of Solomon he says that he devoted his energies and some little\nwealth “to rearing phallic and Solophallic shrines over all the\nhigh places around him, and especially in front of Jerusalem, and\non and around the Mount of Olives.”  On each side of the entrance\nto his celebrated temple, under the great phallic spire which\nformed the portico, were two handsome columns over fifty feet\nhigh, by the side of which were the sun God Belus and his\nchariots.",
        "In a description of this temple it is represented as being one\nhundred and twenty feet long and forty feet broad, while the\nporch, a phallic emblem, “was a huge tower, forty feet long,\ntwenty feet broad, and two hundred and forty feet high.”  We are\nassured by Forlong that Solomon’s temple was like hundreds\nobserved in the East, except that its walls were a little higher\nthan those usually seen, and the phallic spire out of proportion\nto the size of the structure.  “The Jewish porch is but the\nobelisk which the Egyptian placed beside his temple; the Boodhist\npillars which stood all around their Dagobas; the pillars of\nHercules, which stood near the Phoenician temple; and the spire\nwhich stands beside the Christian Church.\"[104]",

        "The rites and ceremonies observed in the worship of Baal-Peor are\nnot of a character to be described in these pages:  it is perhaps\nsufficient to state that by them the fact is clearly established\nthat profligacy, regulated and controlled by the priestly order\nas part and parcel of religion, was not confined to the Gentiles;\nbut, on the contrary, that the religious observances of the Jews\nprior to the Babylonian captivity were even more gross than were\nthose of the Assyrians or the Hindoos.",
        "These impure faiths arose at a time when man as the sole creator\nof offspring became god, when the natural instincts of woman were\nsubdued, and when passion as the highest expression of the divine\nforce came to be worshipped as the most important attribute of\nhumanity.",
        "The extent to which these faiths have influenced later religious\nbelief and observances is scarcely realized by those who have not\ngiven special attention to this subject.",
        "It has been stated that in the time of Solon, law-giver of\nAthens, there were twenty temples in the various cities of Greece\ndedicated to Venus the courtesan, within which were practiced, in\nthe name of religion, the most infamous rites and the most\nshameless self-abandonment; and that throughout Europe, down to a\nlate period in the history of the race, religious festivals were\ncelebrated at certain seasons of the year, at which the\nceremonies performed in honor of the god of fornication were of\nthe grossest nature, and at which the Bacchanalian orgies were\nonly equalled by those practiced in the religious temples of\nBabylon.",
        "It is impossible longer to conceal the fact that passion,\nsymbolized by a serpent, an upright stone, and by the male and\nfemale organs of generation, the male appearing as the “giver of\nlife,” the female as a necessary appendage to it, constituted the\ngod-idea of mankind for at least four thousand years; and,\ninstead of being confined to the earlier ages of that period, we\nshall presently see that phallic worship had not disappeared,\nunder Christianity, as late and even later than the sixteenth\ncentury.",
        "Such has been the result of the ascendancy gained by the grosser\nelements in human nature: the highest idea of the Infinite\npassion symbolized by the organs of generation, while the\nprincipal rites connected with its worship are scenes of\ndebauchery and self-abasement.",
        "At the present time it is by no means difficult to trace the\ngrowth of the god-idea.  First, as we have seen, a system of pure\nNature-worship appeared under the symbol of a Mother and child. \nIn process of time this particular form of worship was supplanted\nby a religion under which the male principle is seen to be in the\nascendancy over the female.  Later a more complicated system of\nNature-worship is observed in which the underlying principles are\nconcealed, or are understood only by the initiated.  Lastly,\nthese philosophical and recondite principles are forgotten and\nthe symbols themselves receive the adoration which once belonged\nto the Creator.  The change which the ideas concerning womanhood\nunderwent from the time when the natural feminine characters and\nqualities were worshipped as God, to the days of Solon the\nGrecian law-giver, when women had become merely tools or slaves\nfor the use and pleasure of men, is forcibly shown by a\ncomparison of the character ascribed to the female deities at the\ntwo epochs mentioned.  Athene who in an earlier age had\nrepresented Wisdom had in the age of Solon degenerated into a\npatroness of heroes; but even as a Goddess of war her patronage\nwas as nought compared with that of the courtesan Venus, at whose\nshrine “every man in Greece worshipped.”",
        "The extent to which women, in the name of religion, have been\ndegraded, and the part which in the past they have been compelled\nto assume in the worship of passion may not at the present time\nbe disguised, as facts concerning this subject are well\nauthenticated.  In a former work,[105] attention has been\ndirected to the religious rites of Babylon, the city in which it\nwill be remembered the Tower of Belus was situated.  Here women\nof all conditions and ranks were obliged, once in their life, to\nprostitute themselves in the temple for hire to any stranger who\nmight demand such service, which revenue was appropriated by the\npriests to be applied to sacred uses.  This act it will be\nremembered was a religious obligation imposed by religious\nteachers and enforced by priestly rule.  It was a sacrifice to\nthe god of passion.  A similar custom prevailed in Cyprus.",
        "[105] See Evolution of Woman, p. 228.",
        "Most of the temples of the later Hindoos had bands of consecrated\nwomen called the “Women of the Idol.”  These victims of the\npriests were selected in their infancy by Brahmins for the beauty\nof their persons, and were trained to every elegant\naccomplishment that could render them attractive and which would\ninsure success in the profession which they exercised at once for\nthe pleasure and profit of the priesthood.  They were never\nallowed to desert the temple; and the offspring of their\npromiscuous embraces were, if males, consecrated to the service\nof the Deity in the ceremonies of this worship, and, if females,\neducated in the profession of their mothers.[106]",

        "That prostitution was a religious observance, which was practiced\nin Eastern temples, cannot in the face of accessible facts be\ndoubted.  Regarding this subject, Inman says:",
        "“To us it is inconceivable, that the indulgence of passion could\nbe associated with religion, but so it was.  The words expressive\nof ’sanctuary,’ ’consecrated,’ and ’sodomites’ are in the Hebrew\nessentially the same.  It is amongst the Hindoos of to-day as it\nwas in the Greece and Italy of classic times; and we find that\n’holy woman’ is a title given to those who devote their bodies to\nbe used for hire, which goes to the service of the temple.”",
        "The extent to which ages of corruption have vitiated the purer\ninstincts of human nature, and the degree to which centuries of\nsensuality and superstition have degraded the nature of man, may\nbe noticed at the present time in the admissions which are\nfrequently made by male writers regarding the change which during\nthe history of the race has taken place in the god-idea.  None of\nthe attributes of women, not even that holy instinct–maternal\nlove, can by many of them be contemplated apart from the ideas of\ngrossness which have attended the sex-functions during the ages\nsince women first became enslaved.  As an illustration of this we\nhave the following from an eminent philologist of recent times, a\nwriter whose able efforts in unravelling religious myths bear\ntestimony to his mental strength and literary ability.",
        "“The Chaldees believed in a celestial virgin who had purity of\nbody, loveliness of person, and tenderness of affection, and she\nwas one to whom the erring sinner could appeal with more chance\nof success than to a stern father.  She was portrayed as a mother\nwith a child in her arms, and every attribute ascribed to her\nshowing that she was supposed to be as fond as any earthly female\never was.\"[107]",
        "[107] Inman, Ancient Faiths, vol. i., p. 59.",
        "After thus describing the early Chaldean Deity, who, although a\npure and spotless virgin, was nevertheless worshipped as a\nmother, or as the embodiment of the altruistic principles\ndeveloped in mankind, this writer goes on to say: “The worship of\nthe woman by man naturally led to developments which our\nCOMPARATIVELY SENSITIVE NATURES [the italics are mine] shun as\nbeing opposed to all religious feeling,” which sentiment clearly\nreveals the inability of this writer to estimate womanhood, or\neven motherhood, apart from the sensualized ideas which during\nthe ages in which passion has been the recognized god have\ngathered about it.",
        "The purity of life and the high stage of civilization reached by\nan ancient people, and the fact that these conditions were\nreached under pure Nature-worship, or when the natural attributes\nof the female were regarded as the highest expression of the\ndivine in the human, prove that it was neither the appreciation\nnor the deification of womanhood which “led to developments which\nsensitive natures shun as being opposed to all religious\nfeeling,” but, on the contrary, that it was the lack of such\nappreciation which stimulated the lower nature of man and\nencouraged every form of sensuality and superstition.  In other\nwords, it was the subjection of the natural female instincts and\nthe deification of brute passion during the later ages of human\nhistory which have degraded religion and corrupted human nature.",
        "Although at the present time it is quite impossible for scholars\nto veil the fact that the god-idea was originally worshipped as\nfemale, still, most modern writers who deal with this subject\nseem unable to understand the state of human society which must\nhave existed when the instincts, qualities, and characters\npeculiar to the female constitution were worshipped as divine. \nSo corrupt has human nature become through over-stimulation and\nindulgence of the lower propensities, that it seems impossible\nfor those who have thus far dealt with this subject to perceive\nin the earlier conceptions of a Deity any higher idea than that\nconveyed to their minds at the present time by the sexual\nattributes and physical functions of females–namely, their\ncapacity to bring forth, coupled with the power to gratify the\nanimal instincts of males, functions which women share with the\nlower orders of life.",
        "The fact that by an ancient race woman was regarded as the head\nor crown of creation, that she was the first emanation from the\nDeity, or, more properly speaking, that she represented\nPerceptive Wisdom, seems at the present time not to be\ncomprehended, or at least not acknowledged.  The more recently\ndeveloped idea, that she was designed as an appendage to man, and\ncreated specially for his use and pleasure,–a conception which\nis the direct result of the supremacy of the lower instincts over\nthe higher faculties,–has for ages been taught as a religious\ndoctrine which to doubt involves the rankest heresy.",
        "The androgynous Venus of the earlier ages, a deity which although\nfemale was figured with a beard to denote that within her were\nembraced the masculine powers, embodied a conception of universal\nwomanhood and the Deity widely different from that entertained in\nthe later ages of Greece, at a time when Venus the courtesan\nrepresented all the powers and capacities of woman considered\nworthy of deification.",
        "To such an extent, in later ages, have all our ideas of the\nInfinite become masculinized that in extant history little except\noccasional hints is to be found of the fact that during\nnumberless ages of human existence the Supreme Creator was\nworshipped as female.",
        "One has only to study the Greek character to anticipate the\nmanner in which any subject pertaining to women would be treated\nby that arrogant and conceited race; and, as until recently most\nof our information concerning the past has come through Greek\nsources, the distorted and one-sided view taken of human events,\nand the contempt with which the feminine half of society has been\nregarded, are in no wise surprising.  We must bear in mind the\nfact, however, that the Greeks were but the degenerate\ndescendants of the highly civilized peoples whom they were\npleased to term “barbarians,” and that they knew less of the\norigin and character of the gods which they worshipped, and which\nthey had borrowed from other countries, than is known of them at\nthe present time.",
        "About 600 years B.C., we may believe that mankind had sunk to the\nlowest depth of human degradation, since which time humanity has\nbeen slowly retracting its course; not, however, with any degree\nof continuity or regularity, nor without lapses, during which for\nhundreds of years the current seemed to roll backward.  Indeed\nwhen we review the history of the intervening ages, and note the\nextent to which passion, prejudice, and superstition have been in\nthe ascendancy over reason and judgment, we may truly say: “The\nfathers have eaten sour grapes and the children’s teeth have been\nset on edge.”",
        "It has been said of the Persians that in their zeal to purify the\nsensualized faiths which everywhere prevailed they manifested a\ndecided “repugnance to the worship of images, beasts, or symbols,\nwhile they sought to establish the worship of the only true\ncreative force, or God–Holy Fire.”",
        "From the facts to be gleaned concerning this people during the\nseventh and eighth centuries B.C., it is quite probable that they\nstill had a faint knowledge of a former age of intellectual and\nmoral greatness, and that it was their object, at that time, to\nreturn to the purer principles which characterized it.  That\ntheir efforts were subsequently copied by surrounding nations is\nshown in the facts connected with their history.",
        "Soon leading Syrians and Jews began to learn from their Eastern\nneighbor that the worship of images could scarcely be acceptable\nto a god which they were beginning to invest with a certain\ndegree of spirituality.  There is little doubt, at the present\ntime, that the attempt to spiritualize the religion of the Jews\nwas due to the influence of the Persians.  However, the length of\ntime required to effect any appreciable improvement in an\nestablished form of worship is shown by the fact that, two\nhundred years later, little change for the better was observed in\nthe temples, in which licentiousness had become a recognized\nreligious rite.  Even at the present time, it is reported that in\nmany places of worship in the East there still reside “holy women\n–god’s women,” who, like those in Babylon, described by various\nwriters, are devoted to the “god of fire.”",
        "In a comparison made between the religion of Persia and the\ndoctrines said to have been taught by Moses, Inman remarks:",
        "“The religion of Persia as reformed by Zoroaster so closely\nresembles the Mosaic, that it would be almost impossible to\ndecide which has the precedence of the other, unless we knew how\nancient was the teaching of Zoroaster, and how very recent was\nthat said to be from Moses.  Be this as it may, we find the\nancient Persians resemble the Jews in sacrificing upon high\nplaces, in paying divine honor to fire, in keeping up a sacred\nflame, in certain ceremonial cleansings, in possessing an\nhereditary priesthood who alone were allowed to offer sacrifices,\nand in making their summum bonum the possession of a numerous\noffspring.\"[108]",
        "[108] Ancient Faiths, vol. ii., p. 64.",
        "It is quite plain that by both these nations the wisdom of an\nearlier race was nearly forgotten.  Seven hundred years B.C.  the\nPersians had doubtless already adopted the worship of “One God\"\nwho was the Regenerator or Destroyer, a Deity which, as we have\nseen, originally comprehended the powers of Nature–namely the\nsun’s heat and the cold of winter.  That at this time, however,\nthey had lost the higher truths involved in the conception of\nthis Deity, is evident.  They had become worshippers of fire, or\nof that subtle igneous fluid residing in fire which they believed\nto be creative force.  Although the Persiaus like all the other\nnations of the globe had lost or forgotten the higher truths\nenunciated by an older race, there is no evidence going to show\nthat they ever became gross phallic worshippers like the Jews;\nthat they were not such is shown in the fact that down to the\ntime of Alexander the women of Persia still held a high and\nhonorable position, and that the female attributes had not become\nwholly subject to male power.",
        "Had we no other evidence of the comparatively exalted character\nof the religion of the Persians than the history of the lives of\nsuch men as Darius, Cyrus, Artaxerxes, and others, we should\nconclude, notwithstanding the similarity in the ceremonials of\nthese two religions, that some influence had been at work to\npreserve them from the cruelty and licentiousness which prevailed\namong the Jews.  It is related of Cyrus that he used to wish that\nhe might live long enough to repay all the kindness which he had\nreceived.  It is also stated that on account of the justice and\nequity shown in his character, a great number of persons were\ndesirous of committing to his care and wisdom “the disposal of\ntheir property, their cities, and their own persons.”",
        "In striking contrast to the mild and humane character of Cyrus\nstands that of the licentious and revengeful David, a “man after\nGod’s own heart.”",

        "No one I think can read the Avestas without being impressed by\nthe prominence there given to the subjects of temperance and\nvirtue.  In their efforts to purify religion, and in the attempts\nto return to their more ancient faith, the disciples of\nZoroaster, as early as eight hundred years before Christ, had\nadopted a highly spiritualized conception of the Deity.  They had\ntaught in various portions of Asia Minor the doctrine of one God,\na dual entity by means of which all things were created.  They\ntaught also the doctrine of a resurrection and that of the\nimmortality of the soul.  It was at this time that they\noriginated, or at least propounded, the doctrine of hell and the\ndevil, a belief exactly suited to the then weakened mental\ncondition of mankind, and from which humanity has not yet gained\nsufficient intellectual and moral strength to free itself.  This\nPersian devil, which had become identified with winter or with\nthe absence of the sun’s rays, was now Aryhman, or the “powers of\ndarkness,” and was doubtless the source whence sprang the\npersonal devil elaborated at a later age by Laotse in China.",
        "As the Jews had no writings prior to the time of Ezra or\nJeremiah, it is now believed that many of the doctrines\nincorporated in their sacred books were borrowed from Persian,\nIndian, and Egyptian sources.  Resurrection from the dead, or the\nresurrection of the body, was for hundreds of years prior to the\nbirth of Christ an established article of Egyptian and Persian\nfaith, while spiritual regeneration, symbolized by the outward\ntypification of “being born again,” was the beginning of a new\nlife and an admission to the heavenly state.",
        "In the Khordah Avesta we have the following concerning the\ndoctrine of the resurrection and that of future rewards and\npunishments.",
        "“I am wholly without doubt in the existence of the good\nMazdaycinian faith, in the coming of the resurrection and the\nlater body, in the stepping over the bridge Chinvat, in an\ninvariable recompense of good deeds and their reward, and of bad\ndeeds and their punishment.”",
        "The Zoroastrians, who led the way in the great intellectual and\nreligious awakening which took place during the intervening years\nfrom 700 B.C. to 400 B.C., sought to purify all things by fire\nand water, the two principles which had come to be regarded as\nthe original elements, from which, or by which, all things are\nproduced.",
        "Prior to this time, in Persia, and long afterwards by various\nother nations, baptism, a rite performed at puberty, was\nconnected only with the sexual obligations of the person\nreceiving it, but in the age which we are considering it became\nespecially a cleansing or regenerating process, and was the means\nby which the pious devotee became initiated into the mysteries of\nholy living, or by which she or he was “born again.”",
        "As in their religious procedure every act was performed in\nconnection with symbols, so in the matter of baptism they were\nnot satisfied with the inner consciousness of regeneration, but\nmust go through with certain processes which typified the new\nlife upon which they had entered.  According to Wilford, the\noutward symbolization of the “new birth” in the East is\nmanifested in the following manner:",
        "“For the purpose of regeneration it is directed to make an image\nof pure gold of the female power of nature, either in the shape\nof a woman or of a cow.  In this statue, the person to be\nregenerated is inclosed, and dragged out through the natural\nchannel.  As a statue of pure gold and of proper dimensions would\nbe too expensive, it is sufficient to make an image of the sacred\nYoni, through which the person to be regenerated is to pass.”",
        "Thus at the time Nicodemus is said to have queried concerning the\nmysteries of the new birth, it is observed that the outward forms\nof regeneration had long been in use among the pagans.  In\npassing themselves through these apertures, the applicant for\nregeneration was supposed to represent the condition of one\n\"issuing from the womb to a new scope of life.”",
        "According to the testimony of various writers upon this subject,\nthere are still extant, not alone in oriental countries, but in\nIreland and Scotland as well, numerous excavations or apertures\nin the rocks which by an early race were used for the same\npurpose.  Through the misconception, bigotry, and ignorance of\nthe Roman Catholic missionaries in Ireland, these openings were\ndesignated as the “Devil’s Yonies.”  Although these emblems\ntypified the original conception of one of their most sacred\nbeliefs, namely, the “new birth,” still they were “heathen\nabominations” with which the devotees of the new (?) faith must\nnot become defiled.",
        "The people who executed these imperishable designs, and who have\nleft in the British Isles innumerable evidences of their\nreligious beliefs, are supposed by some writers to belong to a\ncolony which, having been expelled from Persia on account of\ntheir peculiar religious beliefs, settled in the “White Island,\"\nthe “Island of the Blessed.”  This subject will, however, be\nreferred to later in this work.",
        "When we closely examine the facts connected with the evolution of\nreligion, there can be little doubt that the Persians laid the\nfoundation for that great moral and intellectual awakening which\na century or two later is represented by Confucious, Gotama\nBuddha, and Pythagoras.  From the Persians, doubtless Jew and\nGentile alike received the little leaven of spirituality which in\nlater ages crept into their gross conception of a Deity.",
        "By the Persians, the Hindoos, and other nations of the East, it\nwas believed that the end of each cycle of six hundred years, at\nwhich time a new sun or savior was to come, would mark a new era\nof religious development.  At the close of each of these cycles\nit was devoutly expected that the “golden age” of the past would\nbe restored, and that mankind would again be freed from the ills\nwhich had overtaken them.  As many of these cycles had passed,\nnumerous deliverers, saviors, or solar incarnations had appeared\nin India, Gotama Buddha having been the ninth.  In the East,\nabout six or seven hundred years before the birth of Christ, not\nonly one savior or prophet but three or four of them appeared.",
        "Concerning the leader of the reform in Persia there seem to be\nmany conflicting accounts.  The learned Faber concludes that\nthere were two Zarathustras or Zoroasters, the former being\nidentical with Menu, the law giver and triplicated deity of\nIndia, and who by various writers is recognized as the Noah of\nthe Hebrews.  According to Pliny, the former lived thousands of\nyears before Christ.  Several writers concur in placing him five\nthousand years before the siege of Troy.  According to Sir Wm.\nJones, the latter Zoroaster lived in the time of Darius\nHystaspes.  It is now claimed that in the Dabistan, one of the\nsacred books of Persia, thirteen Zoroasters appear.  The name of\nthe last great leader, together with a few of his doctrines, and\nvarious scattered fragments in the Gathas, are all that remain on\nrecord of a man whose personality stands connected with the\nearliest attempt to reform a degraded and sensualized religion.",
        "That this prophet was without honor in his own country is shown\nby the following lamentation:",

None of the servants pay reverence to me, nor do the\nwicked rulers of the country.  How shall I worship thee further,\nliving Wise One?  What help did Zarathustra receive when he\nproclaimed the truths?  What did he obtain through the good mind? \n.  .  .

        "“Knowledge, magnanimity, and energy are the virtues universally\nbinding.  Gravity, generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness,\nand kindness constitute perfect virtue.  Sincerity is the very\nway to Heaven.  My doctrine is that of an all-pervading unity. \nThe superior man is catholic and not partisan.  The mean is\npartisan and not catholic.  The superior man is affable but not\nadulatory, the mean is adulatory but not affable.”",
        "When asked for a word which should serve as a rule of practice\nfor all our life he replied: “Is not Reciprocity such a word?\nWhat you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.”  On\none occasion the question was asked him: “What do you say\nconcerning the principle that injury shall be recompensed with\nkindness?” To which he replied: “Recompense injury with justice,\nand recompense kindness with kindness.\"[117]",

        "It is recorded by his disciples that there are four things from\nwhich the master was entirely free.  “He had no foregone\nconclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no\negoism.”  Contrary to the rule of most reformers or leaders of\nopinion, he always regarded himself as a learner as well as\nteacher.  It is related of Confucius that he at one time desired\na governmental position, thinking that through its occupancy he\nmight the better disseminate the ancient doctrines of rectitude\nand virtue.  Offers of individual advantage could not swerve him\nfrom his well-grounded principles of honor.  On one occasion one\nof the rulers of the country proposed to confer upon him a city\nand its revenues, but Confucius replied: “A superior man will\nonly receive reward for services which he has rendered.  I have\ngiven advice to the duke-king, but he has not obeyed it, and now\nhe would endow me with this place! very far is he from\nunderstanding me.\"[118]",

        "The fact seems evident that Confucius had not sufficient strength\nof character to attempt a change in the social conditions of his\ntime.  He had not that grandeur of soul which enabled him to\nstrike the key-note of reform.  Monarchical institutions and\nsocial distinctions he did not rebuke.  The brotherhood of man\nand the levelling processes in human society were probably never\nthought of by him; certainly they were never attempted.",
        "By certain writers Confucius has been accused of insincerity in a\nfew minor matters; still, the wisdom contained in his religious\ndoctrines, the philosophical value of his teachings relative to\nthe regulation of human conduct, and, above all, his purity of\npurpose, justly entitles his name to be enrolled among the great\nreformers of the world.",
        "The lasting influence which this man exerted upon the minds of\nhis countrymen, and the appreciation in which his name and works\nare still held, are shown by the fact that his descendants\nconstitute the only order of hereditary nobility in China.",
        "“He lived five hundred years before Christ; and yet to this day,\nthrough all the changes and chances of time and of dynasties, the\ndescendants of Confucius remain the only hereditary noblemen and\nnational pensioners in the empire.  Even the imperial blood\nbecomes diluted, degraded, and absorbed into the body politic\nafter the seventh generation; but the descendants of Confucius\nremain separate, through all the mutations of time and of\ngovernment.\"[119]",

The word Taou signifies reason, but\nthe doctrines believed by the Taoists prove their system to be\nthe most irrational of all the religions of the East.  In an\narticle on The Taouist Religion, Warren Benton says:",
        "“The tendency in rationalism is toward the utter destruction of a\nbelief in the existence of unseen spirits of evil.  Enlightened\nreason dethrones devils; but Laotse created devils innumerable,\nand the chief concern of the Taouist sect has always been to\nmanipulate these emissaries of evil.  Modern rationalists deny\nthe existence of devils, and relegate them to the category of\nmyths and to personified ideas.  Not so the rationalist of the\nOrient.  He finds his greatest pleasure in contemplating the very\natmosphere he breathes as filled with spirits constantly seeking\nhis injury; and to outwit his satanic majesty is the chief end of\nlife.\"[120]",

        "At a time when a personal devil was gradually assuming shape, it\nwould have been singular, indeed, if there had not arisen one\nwho, by his peculiar temperament and natural disposition, was\nexactly suited to the task of elaborating this doctrine in all\nits grim seriousness.  That such an one did arise in the person\nof Laotse is evident from what is known regarding his history and\nteachings.",
        "The growth of religious faith had long tended in this direction. \nTyphon, “the wind that blasts,” “Darkness,” and the “cold of\nwinter,” constituted the foundation of a belief in a personal\nDevil; and, when the time was ripe for the appearance of his\nsatanic majesty, it required only a hypochondriac– a disordered\nmental organization–to formulate and project this gloomy and\nunwholesome doctrine.",
        "There is little known of the life and character of Laotse except\nthat he labored assiduously through a long life-time for the\nestablishment of certain principles or tenets which he believed\nto be essential to the well-being of humanity.  In the twentieth\nchapter of his work are found to be some hints of his personality\nand of the gloomy cast of his character.  He complains that while\nother men are joyous and gay, he alone is despondent.  He is\n\"calm like a child that does not yet smile.”  He is “like a\nstupid fellow, so confused does he feel.  Ordinary men are\nenlightened; he is obscure and troubled in mind.  Like the sea,\nhe is forgotten and driven about like one who has no certain\nresting place.  All other men are of use; he alone is clownish\nlike a peasant.  He alone is unlike other men, but he honors the\nnursing mother.”",
        "Of all the various teachers which arose during the fifth, sixth,\nand seventh centuries B.C., none of them were able to rise to the\nposition of moral grandeur occupied by Gotama Buddha.  The\nefforts put forth by this great teacher seem to have been humane\nrather than religious.  In his time, especially in India, society\nhad become encysted beneath a crust of seemingly impenetrable\nconservatism, while religion, or priestcraft, riveted the chains\nby which the masses of the people were enslaved.",
        "The mission of Buddha was to burst asunder the bonds of the\noppressed and to abolish all distinctions of caste.  This was to\nbe accomplished through the awakening of the divine life in each\nindividual.  The leading processes by which the lines of caste\nwere weakened were in direct opposition to the established order\nof society.  It was a blow at the old Brahminical social and\nreligious code which had grown up under the reign of\npriest-craft.",
        "Notwithstanding the sex prejudice which had come to prevail in\nIndia, it was directly stated by Buddha that any man or woman who\nbecame his disciple, who renounced the world and by abstinence\nfrom the lower indulgences of sense proclaimed her or his\nadherence to the higher principles of life, “at once lost either\nthe privilege of a high caste or the degradation of a low one.” \nEarthly distinctions were of no consequence.  Rank depended not\non the outward circumstance of birth, but on the ability of the\nindividual to resist evil, or, upon his capacity to receive the\nhigher truths enunciated by the new sun or savior–Buddha.",
        "In one of the canonical books he is represented as saying:",
        "“Since the doctrine which I teach is completely pure, it makes no\ndistinction between noble and common, between rich and poor.  It\nis, for example, like water, which washes both noblemen and\ncommon people, both rich and poor, both good and bad, and\npurifies all without distinction.  It may, to take another\nillustration, be compared to fire, which consumes mountains,\nrocks, and all great and small objects between heaven and earth. \nAgain, my doctrine is like heaven, inasmuch as there is room\nwithin it without exception, for whomsoever it may be; for men\nand women, for boys and girls, for rich and poor.\"[121]",

        "There is little doubt that the religion of Buddha was an attempt\nto return to the almost forgotten principles of a past age of\nspiritual and moral greatness.  According to this ancient wisdom,\nman is an immortal soul struggling for perfection.  The growth of\nthe real man is a natural unfolding of the divine principle\nwithin, such process of evolution being accomplished through the\npower of the will.  As every individual must work out his own\nsalvation, this will-force must ever be directed toward the\ncomplete mastery of the body, or the lower self.  In other words,\nthe development of the higher life depends upon the power of the\nindividual to overcome or conquer evil.  The effect of every\nthought, word, and deed is woven into the soul, and no one can\nevade the consequences of his own acts.  All sin is the result of\nselfishness, so that only when one renounces self and begins to\nlive for others does the soul-life begin.  No one who has arrived\nat a state of soul-consciousness will lead a selfish or impure\nlife.  On the contrary, every impulse of the devout Buddhist goes\nout toward humanity and God, of whom he is a conscious part.",
        "Gotama Buddha was not a “savior” in the sense of bloody sacrifice\nfor the sins of the people.  On the contrary, he was an example\nto mankind–a man who through moral purification and a life of\nself- abnegation had prepared himself for this holy office. \nMythologically, or astrologically, he was the new sun born at the\nclose of the cycle.  He was the great Light which revealed the\nway to eternal repose– Nirvana.  The mythical Buddha was the\nprototype of the mythical Christ.  His mother was Mai or Mary,\nQueen of Heaven, or the Vernal Spring.  He was a new incarnation\nof the Sun–the Savior of the world.  In process of time his many\nmiracles were offered as proof of his divine character.  Although\nhe taught the existence of a great and universal Power, he made\nno attempt to explain the unknowable.  The Infinite is to be\ncontemplated only through its manifestations.  Nirvana is not\nannihilation, as has been erroneously taught by Christian\nmissionaries.  As explained by Buddhists themselves, it\ncomprehends a state of absolute rest from human strife and\nwretchedness.  It is the absorption or relapsing into the great\nFirst Principle, whence all life is derived–a state so pure that\nthe human is lost in the divine.",

        "From the Buddhist colleges at Nolanda went forth teachers who,\ninspired with enthusiasm in the cause of human justice and\nindividual liberty, endeavored to abolish the abominations which\nhad grown up under Brahminical rule.  The masses of the people,\nhowever, were too deeply sunken in infamy, wretchedness, and\nignorance to accept, or even understand, the pure doctrines of\nthe great teacher, and, as might have been anticipated, priest-\ncraft soon assumed its wonted arrogance, and eventually the whole\nparaphernalia of antiquated dogmas were tacked upon the new\nsystem.",
        "Through the various efforts put forth for the elevation of\nmankind during the six or seven hundred years which preceded the\nadvent of Christianity, sufficient strength had been given to the\nmoral impetus of humanity to create in many portions of the world\na strong desire for a return to purer principles, and to make the\nappearance of a spiritual teacher like Christ possible.  The\neffects, however, of ages of moral and intellectual degradation,\nin which the lowest faculties have been stimulated to the highest\ndegree, are not wiped out in a few centuries of struggle by the\nfew among the people who desire reform.  As true reform means\ngrowth, those who have reached a higher stage of development can\nonly point the way to others–they are powerless to effect\nchanges for which the masses are unprepared.",
        "Although through a partial revival of the ideas entertained by an\nancient people the attempt was made by Zoroaster, Confucius,\nGotama Buddha, Pythagoras, the Stoics, and other schools of\nphilosophy, to elevate the masses of the people, and, although\nthe unadulterated teachings of the man called Christ were\ndoubtless an outgrowth of this movement, yet the human mind had\nnot, even as late as the appearance of this last-named reformer,\nsufficiently recovered from its thraldom to enable the masses to\ngrasp those higher truths which had been entertained by an\nearlier civilized people.",
        "While there are doubtless many points of similarity between the\nreligious system elaborated by Gotama Buddha and that enunciated\nby Christ, there is little likeness between the teachings of the\nformer and those set forth by the Romish Church, or by Paul. \nSeven hundred years B.C., the Persians had grasped the idea that\nvirtue is its own reward, and that every soul is responsible for\nits own growth.  The fundamental doctrine of the Christian Church\nto-day is that of a vicarious atonement–a belief which takes\naway man’s responsibility for his own misdeeds.",
        "By comparing the sacred writings of the Persians with the history\nof the events connected with the conception and birth of the\nmythical Christ as recorded in the New Testament, the fact is\nobserved that the latter appears to be closely connected with the\ncentral figure of Persian mythology.  It has been found that the\nvisit of the Magi, who, following a star, were guided to the spot\nwhere the young child lay, was the fulfilment of a Persian\nprophecy, which is to be found in the life of Zarathustra as\nrecorded in the Zendavesta, while the subsequent history of the\nsame personage is seen to be almost identical with that of the\nHindoo Sun-god Chrishna.",

        "Waite notices the conclusion of Faber that this prediction was\nlong before the birth of Christ, and states that one of the\nreasons for such a conclusion was, that in the old Irish history\na similar prophecy appears–a prophecy which was delivered by a\n\"Druid of Bokhara.”  The identity of this Irish prophecy with the\none in the East ascribed to Zarathustra or Zoroaster, is so\nsingular that Faber thinks it can be accounted for only on the\nhypothesis “of an ancient emigration from Persia to Ireland by\nthe northwest passage, which carried the legend with it.”",

According to Waite, there was a sect of Christians\ncalled Prodiceans whose leader, Prodicus, about A.D. 120, boasted\nthat they had the sacred books of Zoroaster.  From an extant\nfragment of the Chronography of Africanus is the following:",

The facts, therefore, which are\ninscribed upon the golden plates, and laid up in the royal\ntemples, I shall record; for it is from the temples there, and\nthe priests connected with them, that the name of Christ has been\nheard of.  Now, there is a temple there to Juno, surpassing the\nroyal palace, which temple Cyrus, that prince instructed in all\npiety, built, and in which he dedicated, in honor of the gods,\ngolden and silver statues, and adorned them with precious stones. \n.  .  .  Now about that time [as the records on the plates\ntestify], the king having entered the temple, with the view of\ngetting an interpretation of certain dreams, was addressed by the\npriest Prupupius thus: ’I congratulate thee, master: Juno has\nconceived.’ ’And the king, smiling, said to him: ’Has she who is\ndead conceived?’ And he said: ’Yes, she who was dead has come to\nlife again, and begets life.’ And the king said: ’What is this?\nexplain it to me.’ And he replied: ’In truth, master, the time\nfor these things is at hand.  For during the whole night the\nimages, both of gods and goddesses, continued beating the ground,\nsaying to each other, Come, let us congratulate Juno.  And they\nsay to me, Prophet, come forward, congratulate Juno, for she has\nbeen embraced.  And I said, How can she be embraced who no longer\nexists?  To which they reply, She has come to life again, and is\nno longer called Juno, but Urama.  For the mighty Sol has\nembraced her.’ “[125]",

Soon after\nthe visit of Thomas to Persia and India, there appeared in\nPalestine and the adjacent countries a gospel of Thomas, in which\nwere set forth various stories closely resembling the legends\nfound in the Hindoo sacred writings.

        "There is no lack of evidence to prove that for several centuries\ngreat numbers of Christians regarded Christ as a solar\nincarnation similar to those which from time to time were born in\nthe valleys of the Nile and the Ganges.  By the fathers in the\nchurch Jesus Christ was named the New Sun, and in the early days\nof Christianity the Egyptians struck a coin representing O. B. or\nthe holy Basilisk, with rays of light darting from his head, on\nthe reverse side of which was figured “Jesus Christ as the New\nSolar Deity.”",
        "The similarity if not the actual identity of the religion of\nChrist and that of the pagans in the second century is shown by\nvarious writers.  The Emperor Hadrian writing to his friend\nServianus says:",
        "“Those who worship Serapis are also Christians; even those who\nstyle themselves the Bishops of Christ are devoted to Serapis.  .\n.  .  There is but one God for them all; him do the Christians,\nhim do the Jews, him do all the Gentiles also worship.”",
        "It has been said that the head of Serapis supplied the first idea\nof the portrait of Christ.  Before the figure of Serapis, in his\ntemple, used to stand Isis, the Celestial Virgin, with the\ninscription “Immaculate is our Lady Isis.”  In her hand she bore\na sheaf of grain.",
        "As Serapis, or Pan, finally became Christ, so Isis, or the Queen\nof Heaven, became his mother, and to the latter were transferred\nall the titles, ceremonies, festivals, and seasons which from the\nearliest time had belonged to the great Goddess of Nature. \nSubsequently, probably about the close of the second century,\nChristianity began slowly to emerge from the worship of Mithras\nand Serapis, “changing the names but not the substance.”",
        "Upon the coinage of Constantine appears Soli Invicto Comita–\"To\nthe invincible sun my companion or guardian,” and when the Greek\nand Roman Christians finally separated themselves from the great\nbody of pagan worshippers they apologized for celebrating the\nbirthday of their Savior on the 25th of December, saying that\n\"they could better perform their rites when the heathen were busy\nwith theirs.”  We are assured that the early Christians no less\nthan the Maji acknowledged Mithras as the first emanation from\nOrmuzd, or the God of Light.  He was the Savior which in an\nearlier age had represented returning life–that which follows\nthe cold of winter.  It was doubtless while they worshipped the\nPersian Mithras that many of the so-called Christians gathered\ntheir first ideas concerning the immortality of the soul and of\nfuture rewards and punishments.",
        "The analogy existing between the festivals, seasons, mythoses,\netc., of the various incarnations of the sun which were\nworshipped by the early historic nations and those belonging to\nChristianity is too striking to be the result of chance.",
        "Buddha originally represented the sun in Taurus.  Crishna was the\nsun in Aries.  The laborings and sufferings of Hercules, a god\nwho was an incarnation of the latter, portrays the history of the\npassage of the sun through the signs of the Zodiac.",

Each and every one of the\nsolar deities has been born at midnight, on the 25th of December,\nat the time when the sun has reached its lowest position and\nbegins to ascend.  Macrobius, a learned Roman writer, observes\nthat the early historic nations “believed that the sun comes\nforth as a babe from its cradle at the winter solstice.”  Neith\nis made to say, “The sun is the fruit of my womb.”",
        "The 15th of August, assumption day, the time when Mary, the\nmother of Jesus, ascends to heaven is the day when the Zodiacal\nconstellation Virgo, “the Greek Astrea, leaves the European\nhorizon,” and the “8th of September, when Virgo emerges from the\nsun’s rays, is held sacred as the Nativity of the Queen of\nHeaven.”",

        "In England, among pagan Saxons, the midwinter festival lasted\ntwelve days, during which time light, fire, the sun, huge stones\nand other similar manifestations of the Deity were adored. \nChristian and pagan alike worshipped these objects.  They called\nChristmas “the birthday of the god who is light.”  The Savior, or\nthe New Sun, was the true light which lighteth every man who\ncometh into the world.  According to the testimony of various\nwriters, the festival held by Christians on Christmas eve used to\nresemble the Feast of Lights, celebrated in Egypt in honor of\nNeith.  The tokens distributed among friends were cakes made of\npaste in the form of babies.  These cakes were called yuledows. \nDow means to “grow bigger,” or, “to increase.”",
        "The Kalends of January at Rome were sacred to Janus and Juno to\nwhom sacrifices were offered.  The Etruscans also worshipped\nJanus who was the god (or goddess) of the year.  Although this\nDeity does not appear among the twelve gods it is said to be the\nparent of them all.  It was represented as having two faces. \nUpon one were the letters representing 365, and upon the other\nwere the keys of life and death.  According to Bryant this Deity\nwas called Junonius, from the goddess Juno, whose name resolves\nitself into Juneh, a dove.  In the Hebrew this name is identical\nwith Yoni or Yuni–the female principle.  On the coins of this\ngod (which was subsequently regarded as male) is usually figured\na boat, although a dove with an olive branch is sometimes\nobserved.[133]",

Down to a late date, fire was a\nconspicuous element at the festival of the winter solstice.

        "The following is an account given in Ramsay’s Travels of Cyrus,\nconcerning the vernal equinox festivals in the East.  When Cyrus\nentered the temples he found the public clad in mourning.  In a\ncavern lay the image of a young man (the dying savior) on a bed\nof flowers and odoriferous herbs Nine days were spent in fasting,\nprayers, and lamentations, after which the public sorrow ceased\nand was changed into gladness.  Songs of joy succeeded weeping\n(for Tamuz), the whole assembly singing hymns: “Adonis is\nreturned to life, Urania weeps no more, he has ascended to\nheaven, he will soon return to earth and banish hence all crimes\nand miseries forever.”  This scene, it will be remembered, was\npresented 500 years prior to the birth of Christ.  In Rome,\nthroughout the months preceding the winter solstice, Hilaria or\nCeres, was especially honored.  Apollo and Diana rose on the 7th\nof the Julian April and on the 10th their religious festivals\nbegan.",
        "On Easter morn, during the earlier ages of the church, the\nobservances of Christians were exactly the same as were those of\nthe so called pagans, all together hurried out long before the\nbreak of day that they might behold the sun ascend, or “dance” as\nthey called it, for on this morning he was to “make the earth\nlaugh and sing.”  Pagan and Christian alike greeted each other\nwith the salutation “The Lord is risen,” and the reply was “The\nLord is risen indeed.”  On Easter morning the peasants of Saxony\nand Brandenburg still climb to the hilltops “to see the sun give\nhis three joyful leaps.”",

        "Perhaps none of the ideas which enter into present religious\nrites and ceremonies proclaims its eastern origin more forcibly\nthan do those connected with the veneration of fire.  The\ntestimony of all writers upon this subject agrees that in Europe,\ndown to a late date in the Christian era, fire was still adored,\nand in some mysterious manner was connected with the Creator.",
        "Upon the subject of the continuation of sun and fire worship to\nmodern times, it is stated that the ancient bonfires with which\nthe North German hills used to be ablaze mile after mile are not\naltogether given up by local custom.  In Ireland as late as the\nyear 1829, the ancient Canaanitish and Jewish rite of passing\nchildren through fire as a cleansing or regenerating process was\nstill in operation.  It is related that at stated seasons great\nfires were lighted in public places, on which occasions, fathers,\ntaking their children in their arms, would leap and run through\nthe flames.  At the same time, two large fires were kindled a\nshort distance from each other through which the cattle were\ndriven.  It was believed that by means of this ceremony,\nfecundity is imparted both to man and beast.  May, the month in\nwhich all Nature revives, and in which life starts anew, is the\ntime selected for the lighting of those sacred fires.  May is the\nmonth of the fires of Baal.  According to Maurice in his work on\nthe Antiquities of India, the festival and the May-pole of Great\nBritain are the remnants of a religious ceremony once common in\nEgypt, India, and Phoenicia, which nations all worshipping the\nsame Deity, celebrated the entrance of the sun into the sign of\nTaurus at the vernal equinox, but which in consequence of the\nprecession of the equinoxes is removed far in the year from its\noriginal situation.  This festival is thought to be coeval with a\ntime when the equinox actually took place at that time.  It was\nformerly in honor of the goddess Bhavania, who, under various\nnames, was once worshipped in every country of the globe.  “She\nis identical with the Dea Syria of Chaldea, and the Venus Urania\nof Persia.”",
        "At the present time there is direct and indisputable evidence\nthat sacred fires once flamed over the whole of Britain.  A few\ndays prior to Bealtine season, every flame was ordered\nextinguished, to be relighted on the first of May by holy fire\ndrawn directly from the sun.  Of fire-worship Toland observes:",
        "“On May-day the Druids made prodigious fires on these cairns,\nwhich being every one in sight of some other could not but afford\na glorious show over a whole nation.  These fires were in honor\nof Beal, or Bealan, Latinized by the Roman writers into Belanus,\nby which name the Gauls and their colonies understood the sun,\nand therefore, to this hour, the first of May is, by the\naboriginal Irish, called la Bealtine, or the day of Belan’s\nfires.  May-day is likewise called la Bealtine by the Highlanders\nof Scotland, who are no contemptible part of the Celtic\noffspring.  So it is with the Isle of Man: and in Armorica a\npriest is called Belee, or the servant of Bel, and the priesthood\nBelegieth.\"[136]",

        "Down to a comparatively recent time, in the British Isles, the\nyouth of both sexes used to arise long before daybreak on\nMay-day, and in large companies set out for the woods, there to\ngather flowers, boughs, and branches, which, on returning at\nnight, were used to decorate their homes.  This festival is said\nto be the most ancient of any known, and during the earlier and\npurer ages of human faith was celebrated in honor of returning\nspring.  In later ages, however, after passion had become the\nonly recognized god, May-day was celebrated with “all manner of\nobscenity and lewdness.”",
        "Although the uneducated masses among the Gauls worshipped Apollo,\nMercury, and Mars without understanding their true significance,\nthe Druids, who are thought to be Pythagorians, invoked one great\npower, the animating force which pervades the universe, the\nessence of which they believed resides in fire.",
        "It is related that although after the introduction of Romish\nChristianity, May fires still continued to be lighted on Bealtine\nday, the more impressive ceremonies took place on the 23d of\nJune, on the eve of the nativity of St.  John.  The early\npreachers, wishing to defer to the prejudices and usages of the\npeople, “yet not so as to interfere with the celebration of\nEaster at the vernal equinox, retained the Bealtine ceremonial,\nonly transferring it to the saint’s day.”  Of these fire\nfestivals and their adoption by the Christian church Tylor says:",
        "“The solar Christmas festival has its pendant at mid-summer.  The\nsummer solstice was the great season of fire festivals throughout\nEurope on the heights, of dancing round and leaping through the\nfires, of sending blazing fire-wheels to roll down from the hills\ninto the valleys, in sign of the sun’s descending course.  These\nancient rites attached themselves in Christendom to St. John’s\nEve.",
        "“It seems as though the same train of symbolism which had adapted\nthe mid-winter festival to the Nativity, may have suggested the\ndedication of the mid-summer festival to John the Baptist, in\nclear allusion to his words ’He must increase but I must\ndecrease.’ “[137]",

        "[139] Although the preservation of holy fire upon every hearth\nwas clearly a religious observance, still, as in those days there\nwere no matches, the material benefit to be derived from this\nprecaution doubtless had a significance apart from that connected\nwith worship.",
        "According to the testimony of Tylor, the festival of John the\nBaptist was celebrated in Germany down to a late date.  This\nwriter quoting from a low German book of the year 1859, refers to\nthe “nod fire” which was sawed out of wood to light the St.\nJohn’s bonfire “through which the people leapt and ran and drove\ntheir cattle.”",

        "On the authority of Peter Martyr, Bishop of Alexandria in the\nthird century, we are informed that the place in Egypt where\nChrist was banished, which is called Maturea, a lamp is kept\nconstantly burning in remembrance of this event.  Although the\nstory of this banishment is doubtless borrowed from the life of\nthe Hindoo god Crishna, the fact is evident that those who\nappropriated it, and used it in furbishing the mythical history\nof Christ, had no scruples against fire worship–a religion which\nwe have been taught to regard as belonging exclusively to the\npagans.",
        "In the ecclesiastical processions of the Church of Rome is\nfrequently to be observed the figure of a dragon, in the mouth of\nwhich “holy and everlasting fire” is observed to be burning.  A\nboy follows the procession with a lighted taper, so that in case\nthe fire is extinguished it may be relighted.  In referring to\nthis subject the Rev. J. B. Deane says:",
        "“The whole ceremony may be considered as a lively representation\nof an ophite procession as it advanced through the sinuous\nparalleiths of Karnak.  So that no wonder the illiterate races\nwere deceived into thinking that there was no harm in calling\nthemselves Christians, for all their dear old faiths are\nhere–fire, arks, poles, and fire in an ark.”",
        "Almost innumerable instances are given by various writers upon\nthis subject, showing that the sun worship of the ancients has\nbeen continued to the present time by the so called followers of\nChrist, in the shrines of the East, with no change even of names\nto distinguish it from that of the Christian faith.  By those who\nhave spent much time in investigating the Holy Land, it is\nrelated that nearly all the spots in and about Jerusalem, sacred\nto Greek and Romish Christians as connected with the life and\ndeath of their risen Lord, are equally sacred to the pagans as\ncommemorating the life and death of their Savior–the New Sun. \nEven Gethsemane is marked by characteristics which prove that it\nis no less interesting to pagans, or, more properly speaking, to\nthe pagan followers of Christ, than it is to those of the Greek\nand Romish churches.  Here is a holy tree, and not far distant is\na cave of Mithras.  There is also to be seen a trinity of stones\n\"those of Janus (Chemosh), Petros and Ion, all solar terms and\nconnected with the sitting or sinking down to rest of the Kuros.”",
        "Messrs. Maundrell and Sandys, who in 1697 visited all the holy\nplaces in and around Jerusalem, state that the entire city, but\nespecially the sites of Moriah, Zion, and suburbs were hotbeds of\nfire and phallic worship as usually developed still in the East.",
        "The topography of ancient Delphi, on the site of which was built\nthe village of Kastri, and at which place excavations are now\nbeing made under the direction of the American School of\nArchaeology, has ever been a place of peculiar interest to the\nmystic.  Here are to be found all the natural features and\nobjects which gladden the heart and stimulate the imagination of\na solo-phallic worshipper.  The holy Mt. Parnassus, the fountain\nof Kastali, the deep cave said to be Pythian, and the remnants of\nhuge sepulchres hewn in the rocks all conspire to make of this\nspot a perfect abode for the god, or goddess, of fertility. \nHere, too, is a beautiful lake and near it a sacred fig-tree\nwhich has been struck by lightning, or, “touched by holy fire.” \nOf this sacred place Forlong writes:",
        "“Christianity has never neglected this so-called Pagan shrine,\nnor yet misunderstood it, if we may judge by the saint she has\nlocated here, for Mr. Hobhouse found in the rocky chasm dipped in\nthe dews of Castaly, but safe in a rocky niche, a Christian\nshrine; and close by a hut called the church of St. John; yea\nverily of Ione, she who had once reigned here supreme; whilst on\na green plot a few yards below the basin, in a little grove of\nolive trees, stood the monastery of Panhagia or Holy Virgin, so\nthat here we still have and beside her sacred form in the cleft,\nmen who have consecrated their manhood to the old Mother and\nQueen of Heaven, just as if she of Syria had never been heard of.",
        "Doubtless they knew little of what civilized Europe calls\nChristianity, for I have spent many days conversing with such\nmen, and seen little difference between them and those similarly\nplaced in the far East–fervid Christians though Greeks and\nSyrians are.”",
        "Perhaps nothing shows the extent to which the religion of the\npagans has been retained by Christianity more than does the\nworship of the serpent.  It has been said that this reptile\nenters into every mythology extant.  Ferguson is authority for\nthe statement that “he is to be found in the wilderness of Sinai,\nthe groves of Epidaurus, and in Samothracian huts.”  He\nconstitutes a prominent factor in the religious worship of India,\nAssyria, Palestine, and Egypt, and, notwithstanding the fact that\nhe is not a native of Ireland, in an earlier age representations\nof him appear in profusion among the symbols of that country.  It\nhas been said that there is scarcely an Egyptian sculpture known\nin which this reptile does not figure.  The serpent whenever it\nappears as a religious emblem always typifies desire–creative\nenergy–which, proceeding from the sun, is manifested in man and\nin animals.  Whether it be a veritable snake in a box, a serpent\nconnected with the figure of a woman, or as a carved\nrepresentation on monuments or stones, or as chains or wreaths on\ncolumns, bas-reliefs or friezes, the signification is the same.",
        "The sacred character of this reptile among the Gnostics is shown\nby the accounts given of their religious rites and ceremonies. \nBy many of these sects this holy creature was kept in a box, ark,\nor chest, and when the eucharistic service was to be performed,\nhe was enticed forth from his resting- place by a bit of bread. \nSo soon as his holiness had wound himself about the offering, the\nsacrifice was complete and the service was concluded by “singing\na hymn to Almighty God, and praying for acceptance in and through\nthe serpent.”",
        "In later ages when the attempt was made to abolish serpent\nworship from the Christian church, it was declared by the leaders\nin the movement that Ophiolatry had been imported from\nPersia–that it had been brought in by ignorant devotees who were\ntoo weak to renounce their former faith.[140]",
        "[140] Forlong, Rivers of Life.",
        "The extent to which the symbols representing Serpent, Sun, Tree,\nand Plant worship are still retained as part and parcel of the\nsymbolism of Christianity is shown by the following report\nregarding the adoption of a seal by the Presbyterian Church which\nappeared in the daily press only a few years ago.",
        "“After the assembly opened, the committee for the selection of a\nseal made a report recommending: That the general assembly hereby\nadopts as its official seal the device of a serpent suspended\nupon a cross, uplifted within a wilderness, in form as\nrepresented upon the official seal of the trustees of the general\nassembly, and displayed upon a circular field of the same\nproportions.  In addition thereto the figure of a rising sun\nappearing above the margin of the wilderness, whose out-shooting\nbeams shall occupy the centre of the field.  Further, the\ndecoration of a demi-wreath of two palm branches (in the form of\nthe wreath upon the seal of the Westminster assembly of divines),\nplaced around the margin of the upper hemisphere of the field;\nand on the lower hemisphere of the field a demi-wreath composed\nof a branch of oak united with an olive branch. Further, that the\nwords of the motto, ’Christus Exaltus Salvatar,’ shall be\ndisplayed in a semi-circle upon the upper part of the field, on\neither side of the standard of the cross, and, encompassing the\nwhole in a bordure, the following words, in full or in proper\nabbreviation thereof, ’The Seal of the General Assembly of the\nPresbyterian Church in the United States of America.’ “",
        "The origin of the rite of Baptism as performed at the present\ntime in Christian churches, may be traced directly to the worship\nof the sun, within which were supposed to reside the reproductive\npowers of Nature.  All nations have had ceremonies corresponding\nto our baptism and confirmation rites, such baptism being either\nby fire or water.  When we remember that for ages fertility, or\nthe power to reproduce, constituted the idea of the Deity, we are\nnot surprised to find that the original signification of the rite\nof baptism had, and still has, in some of the oriental countries,\nspecial reference to the child’s sexual obligations.",
        "In India, the religious rites performed upon the individual occur\nat birth or soon after; at betrothal, which takes place in\nchildhood; at puberty; at marriage, and at death.  The fact will\nbe noticed that all sexual (spiritual) obligations and seasons\nfall within the domain of priestly supervision and surveillance. \nThe child at baptism is dedicated to Vesta, or Hestia, the Queen\nof Hearths and Homes, a divinity who is supposed to assist him in\nsecuring the special evidence of divine favor, namely,\nfruitfulness of body.",
        "Among Hindoos and Jews, excessive reproduction was the Lord’s\nmark of favor.  In India there has been a special hell provided\nfor childless women, and with Jewesses no curse was equal to\nbarrenness.",
        "Baptism, or the ceremony connected with the naming of children in\nChristian countries, is seen to be identical with that performed\nin Mexico among the Aztecs.

In other words\nthe object of the new religion was to stimulate the altruistic\ncharacters which had been developed during the evolutionary\nprocesses, and to strengthen and encourage the almost forgotten\nprinciples of justice and personal liberty upon which early\nsociety was founded, but which through ages of sensuality and\nselfishness had been denied expression.",

From the\ndays of Zoroaster to the final establishment of Christianity by\nPaul, the tendency–although slight–had been toward the\nelevation of woman, and consequently toward a greater\nacknowledgment of the female element in the god-idea. \nConsiderable impetus was given to the cause of woman’s\nadvancement through the doctrines of the various schools of\nphilosophy in Greece, and subsequently by the efforts put forth\nby the Roman lawyers to establish their equality with men before\nthe law; hence, during the first hundred years of the Christian\nera the “new religion” seems to have contained much of the spirit\nof the ancient philosophy.",

        "Although the utmost care has been exercised to conceal the fact\nthat women equally with men, performed the offices connected with\nthe early church, yet by those who have paid attention to the\ntrue history of this movement, there can be no doubt about the\nmatter.  Notwithstanding the early tendencies of the “new\nreligion” toward the recognition of women, and toward the\nrestoration of the female principle in the Deity, the policy to\nbe pursued by the church was soon apparent, for Paul, the real\nfounder of the system calling itself Christian, and a man imbued\nwith Asiatic prejudices concerning women, arrogantly declared\nthat “man is the head of woman as Christ is the head of the\nChurch.”  Women were commanded to be under obedience.  Neither\nwas the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man;\nthus was re-established and emphasized the absurd doctrine of the\nLingaites, that the male is an independent entity, that he is\nspirit and superior to the female which is matter.  After this\nindication of the policy to be pursued under the new regime, it\nwould scarcely be expected that theefforts put forth by the\nvarious sects among the Gnostics toreinstate the female element\neither on the earth or in heavenwould be successful, and as might\nbe anticipated from the factsalready adduced, as early as the\nyear 325, at the council of Nice, a male trinity was formally\nestablished, and soon thereafter, the Collylidians, a sect which\nrigorously persisted in the adoration of the female principle,\nwere condemned.  At the council of Laodicea, A.D. 365, the 11th\ncanon forbade the ordination of women for the ministry and the\n44th canon prohibited them from entering the altar.",
        "The devotees of female worship, although for a time silenced,\nwere evidently not convinced, and to force their understanding\ninto conformity with the newly established order, the Nestorians,\nin the year 430 A. D., reopened the old dispute, and formally\ndenied to Mary the title of Mother of God.  Their efforts,\nhowever, were of little avail, for in the year 451, at the\ncouncil of Ephesus, the third general council, the decision of\nthe Nestorians was reversed and the Virgin Mother reinstated. \nUpon this subject Barlow remarks: “Well might those who made this\nsymbolical doctrine what it now is, at length desire to do tardy\njustice to the female element, by promoting the mother to the\nplace once occupied by the Egyptian Neith, and crowning her Queen\nof Heaven.\"[145] The fact will doubtless be observed, however,\nthat by the Romish Church the idea of the god-mother differs\nwidely from the Queen of Heaven–the original God of the\nancients.  Mary the Mother of Jesus is not a Creator, but simply\na mediator between her Son and His earthly devotees–a doctrine\nonly a trifle less masculine in texture than that of an Almighty\nFather and his victimized son.  The worship of Mary was adopted\nby the so-called Christians in response to a craving in the human\nheart for a recognition of those characters developed in mankind\nwhich may be said to contain the germ of the divine.  The\nmasculine god of the Jews was feared not loved, and his son had\nalready been invested with his attributes.  He was all powerful,\nhence a mediator, a mother, was necessary to intercede in behalf\nof fallen man, and this, too, notwithstanding the fact that woman\nhad become the “cause of evil in the world.”",

        "“When Elohim had prepared and created the world as a result from\njoint pleasure, He wished to ascend up to the elevated parts of\nheaven, and to see that not anything of what pertained to the\ncreation laboured under deficiency.  And He took His Own angels\nwith Him, for His nature was to mount aloft, leaving Edem below;\nfor inasmuch as she was earth, she was not disposed to follow\nupward her spouse.  Elohim, then, coming to the highest part of\nheaven above and beholding a light superior to that which He\nhimself had created, exclaimed: ’Open me the gates, that entering\nin I may acknowledge the Lord.’ “",
        "As he enters the Good One addresses him in the following manner:\n\"Sit thou on my right hand.”  Then the soaring male principle\nsays to the Good One “permit me Lord to overturn the world which\nI have made, for my spirit is bound to men.”  To which the Good\nOne replies: “No evil canst thou do while thou art with me, for\nboth thou and Edem made the world as a result of conjugal joy. \nPermit Edem then, to hold possession of the world as long as she\nwishes; but you remain with me.”  While the father is drawn away\nfrom earth to Heaven, Edem, in the meantime is bringing woes\ninnumerable upon man.  Naas, who has received his evil nature\nfrom her, and who is a child of the Devil, has debauched Eve,\n\"Henceforward vice and virtue are prevalent among men.”  The\nFather seeing these things dispatches Baruch his third angel to\nMoses, and through him spake to the children of Israel, that they\nmight be converted unto the Good One.  But the third angel, Naas,\nby the soul of which came from Edem upon Moses, as also upon all\nmen, observed the precepts of Baruch, and caused his own peculiar\ninjunctions to be hearkened unto.",

When he seemed to have vanquished his antagonists,\nOmphale (now she is Venus) clings to him and entices away\nHercules, and divests him of his power, viz.:  the commands of\nBaruch which Elohim issued.  And in place of this power Babel, or\nVenus, envelops him in her own peculiar robe, that is, in the\npower of Edem, who is the power below; and in this way the\nprophecy of Hercules remained unfulfilled and his work.”",

        "It is believed that this people understood the art of mining and\nthat they were acquainted with the use of iron.  The following is\nan extract from one of Hamilton’s letters on the Antrim coast:",
        "“About the year 1770 the miners, in pushing forward an adit\ntoward the bed of coal, at an unexplored part of the Ballycastle\ncliff, unexpectedly broke through the rock into a narrow passage,\nso much contracted and choked up with various drippings and\ndeposits on its sides and bottom, as rendered it impossible for\nany of the workmen to force through, that they might examine it\nfarther.  Two lads were, therefore, made to creep in with\ncandles, for the purpose of exploring this subterranean avenue. \nThey accordingly pressed forward for a considerable time, with\nmuch labor and difficulty, and at length entered into an\nextensive labyrinth branching off into numerous apartments, in\nthe mazes and windings of which they were completely bewildered\nand lost.  After various vain attempts to return, their lights\nwere extinguished, their voices became hoarse, and, becoming\nwearied and spiritless, they sat down together, in utter despair\nof an escape from this miserable dungeon.  In the meanwhile, the\nworkmen in the adit became alarmed for their safety, fresh hands\nwere incessantly employed, and, in the course of twenty-four\nhours, the passage was so open as to admit the most active among\nthe miners .  .  .  On examining this subterranean wonder, it was\nfound to be a complete gallery, which had been driven forward\nmany hundred yards to the bed of coal: that it branched off into\nnumerous chambers, where miners had carried on their different\nworks: that these chambers were dressed in a workmanlike manner:\nthat pillars were left at proper intervals to support the roof. \nIn short it was found to be an extensive mine, wrought by people\nat least as expert in the business as the present generation. \nSome remains of the tools, and even of the baskets used in the\nworks, were discovered, but in such a decayed state that, on\nbeing touched, they immediately crumbled to pieces.  From the\nremains which were found, there is reason to believe that the\npeople who wrought these collieries anciently, were acquainted\nwith the use of iron, some small pieces of which were found; it\nappeared as if some of their instruments had been thinly shod\nwith that metal.”",
        "Through various means the fact has been ascertained that although\nin the sixth century the buildings in Ireland were mean and\nwholly without artistic merit or skilful design, in an earlier\nage they were magnificent.  Of the causes which produced the\ndecay of architecture, the extinction of the arts and sciences,\nand the general degradation of the people of this island the\ndevotees of St. Paul and of the Romish Church are alike silent.",
        "For ages after the subjection of Ireland, in open defiance of the\nEnglish, the people continued to dispense justice, and to enforce\nthe old Brehon laws of the country.",
        "The lack of regard shown for English law in Ireland, even as late\nas the sixteenth century, is set forth by Baron Fingles, who\nwrote in the time of Henry VIII.  He says:",

The former of these enactments was that which in\nopposition to the English law of primogeniture declared that the\nestate of a parent should descend in equal proportion to all\nmembers of the family.  There was another law, or custom, among\nthis people, which provided that the chief of the tribe or people\nshould be elected by general suffrage.",
        "We have something more than a hint of the condition of ancient\nIreland and its people in a description given by the Greeks of\none of its inhabitants.  Abarras, who visited Greece about six\nhundred years before Christ, and who was called by the Greeks a\nHyperborean, was a priest of the Sun, who went abroad for the\npurpose of study and observation, and to renew by his presence\nand his gifts the old friendship which had long existed between\nthe Celts and the Greeks.  Strabo remarks concerning Abarras that\nhe was much admired by the learned men of Greece.  Himerius says\nof him that he came",
        "“not clad in skins like a Scythian, but with a bow in his hand,\nand a quiver on his shoulders and a plaid wrapped about his body,\na gilded belt encircled his loins, and trousers reaching from his\nwaist downward to the soles of his feet.  He was easy in his\naddress, agreeable in conversation, active in dispatch and secret\nin the management of great affairs; quick in judging of present\noccurrences, and ready to take his part in any sudden emergency;\nprovident, withal, in guarding against futurity; diligent in\nquest of wisdom, fond of friendship; trusting very little to\nfortune; yet having the entire confidence of others, and trusted\nwith everything for his prudence.  He spoke Greek with so much\nfluency that you would have thought that he had been bred or\nbrought up in the Lyceum and had conversed all his life with the\nAcademy of Athens.  He had frequent intercourse with Pythagoras\nwhom he astonished by the variety and extent of his knowledge.”",

        "Although at this time in their history, Apollo the sun-god was\nthe Deity worshipped in Greece and in Ireland, still both nations\nhonored Latona his mother.  The same as in the mother country\n(Persia, or Phoenicia), the oracles, or sybils of Ireland, had\nprophesied a “Savior,” and three hundred years before Greek\nemissaries visited that country, its people, through the\npreaching of Eastern missionaries, had substituted for the\nworship of Latona and Apollo that of the new solar\nincarnation–the third son of Zarathustra, whose appearance had\nbeen heralded by a star.",
        "The identity of the symbols used by the early people of Ireland\nwho were sun worshippers, and those employed in that country for\nages after the Romish Church had usurped the ecclesiastical\nauthority, has been a subject for much comment.  After describing\nthe peculiar form of the early Christian Churches and the\nattention paid to the placing of the windows which were to admit\nthe sun’s rays, Smedley says: “It is possible, in an age of\nallegory and figures, this combination and variety expressed some\nsacred meaning with which we are unacquainted at present.”",
        "The similarity observed in the sacred festivals and religious\nseasons of the ancient inhabitants of Ireland and those of the\nearly Christians, the extent to which large stone crosses,\nlighted candles, the yule log and the various other symbols\nbelonging to fertility, or sun worship, were retained by\nChristianity, furnish strong evidence of the fact that the latter\nsystem is but part and parcel of the former.",

        "Whether as among the Jews in Egypt, a pillar is set up as a\n\"sign” and a “witness” to the Lord, or whether as with the\nMohammedans these figures appear as minarets with egg shaped\nsummits, or as among the Irish they stand forth as stately towers\ndefying time and the elements, or as among the Christians they\nappear as the steeple which points towards heaven, the symbol\nremains, and the original significance is the same.",
        "The Lord of the Israelites who was wont to manifest himself to\nhis chosen people in a “pillar of smoke by day” and a “pillar of\nfire by night” is said to be none other than a reproductive\nemblem, as was also the “Lord” which “reposed in the ark of the\ncovenant.”  Monuments set up to symbolize the religion of the\nParsees or fire-worshippers after they had succumbed to the\npressure brought to bear upon them by the adorers of the male\nprinciple were each and all of them, like their great prototype\nthe tower of Babel, typical of the universal creative power which\nwas worshipped as male.",
        "Notwithstanding the fact that the male energy had come to be\nrecognized as the principal factor in reproduction, it is\nobserved that wherever these monuments or other symbols of\nfertility appear, there is always to be found in close connection\nwith them certain emblems symbolical of the female power; thus\nshowing that although the people by whom they were erected had\nbecome worshippers of the masculine principle, and although they\nhad persuaded themselves that it was the more important element\nin the deity, they had not become so regardless of the truths of\nNature as to attempt to construct a Creator independently of its\nmost essential factor.",
        "Protestant Christianity, probably the most intensely masculine of\nall religious schemes which have claimed the attention of man,\nhas not wittingly retained any of the detested female emblems,\nyet so deeply has the older symbolism taken root, that even in\nthe architecture of the modern Protestant church with its\nark-shaped nave and its window toward the rising sun, may be\ndetected the remnants of that early worship which the devotees of\nthis more recently developed form of religious faith so piously\nignore.",
        "The large number of upright columns, circles of stone, cromlechs\nand cairns still extant in the British Isles, bears testimony to\nthe peculiar character of the religious worship which once\nprevailed in them.  Of these shrines perhaps none is more\nremarkable than that of Stonehenge, in England.  Although during\nthe numberless ages which have passed since this temple was\nerected many of the stones have fallen from their original\nplaces, still by the light of more recently established facts\nconcerning religious symbolism, it has been possible, even under\nits present condition of decay, for scholars to unravel the\nhitherto mysterious significance of this remarkable structure. \nStonehenge is composed of four circles of mammoth upright shafts\ntwenty feet high, the one circle within the other, with immense\nstones placed across them like architraves.",
        "In ancient symbolism the circle was the emblem of eternity, or of\nthe eternal female principle.  Mountains were also sacred to the\ngods.  It has been said that a ring of mountains gave rise to\nthese circular temples.  Faber assures us that a circular stone\ntemple was called the circle of the world or the circle of the\nark, that it represented at once the inclosure of the Noetic\nShip; the egg from which creation was produced; the earth, and\nthe zodiacal circle of the universe in which the sun performs its\nannual revolutions through the signs.  Stonehenge is said to be\nthe temple of the water god Noah, who, as we have seen, was first\nworshipped as half woman and half fish or serpent, but who\nfinally came to be regarded as a man serpent (or fish) Deity.",
        "On approaching Stonehenge from the Northeast, the first object\nwhich engages the attention is a rude boulder, sixteen feet high,\nin a leaning posture.  This stone has been named the Friar’s\nHeel, but until recently its signification has been wholly\nunknown.",

        "Undoubtedly there has never been a religious shrine which has\nexcited more curiosity than has Abury, of which, unfortunately,\nnothing now remains, although in the early part of the eighteenth\ncentury enough had been preserved to prove the identity of its\nsignification with other ancient religious monuments both in the\nBritish Isles and in the countries of the East.  Perhaps there is\nno way by which this shrine can be better understood than by\nquoting the exact language of those who have written upon the\nsubject.  Especially is this true concerning the testimony of\nthose who, after personal investigation, have given to the public\nthe results of their research.",
        "In the History of Wiltshisre, published by Sir R. Colt Hoare,\nBart., appears the following from Dr. Stukeley:",
        "“The situation of Abury is finely chosen for the purpose it was\ndestined to, being the more elevated part of a plain, from whence\nthere is almost an imperceptible descent every way.  But as the\nreligious work in Abury, though great in itself, is but a part of\nthe whole (the avenues stretching above a mile from it each way),\nthe situation of the whole design is projected with great\njudgment, in a kind of large, separate plain, four or five miles\nin diameter.  Into this you descend on all sides from higher\nground.  The whole Temple of Abury may be considered as a\npicture, and it really is so.  Therefore the founders wisely\ncontrived that a spectator have an advantageous prospect of it as\nhe appeared within view.  When I frequented this place, which I\ndid for some years together, to take an exact account of it,\nstaying a fortnight at a time, I found out the entire work by\ndegrees.  The second time I was here, an avenue was a new\namusement; the third year another.  So that at length I\ndiscovered the mystery of it, properly speaking, which was, that\nthe whole figure represented a snake transmitted through a\ncircle.  This is an hieroglyphic or symbol of highest note and\nantiquity.",
        "“In order to put this design in execution, the founders well\nstudied their ground; and to make their representation more\nnatural, they artfully carried it over a variety of elevations\nand depressions, which, with the curvature of the avenues,\nproduces sufficiently the desired effect.  To make it still more\nelegant and picture-like, the head of the snake is carried up the\nsouthern promontory of Hackpen Hill, toward the village of West\nKennet; nay, the very name of the hill is derived from the\ncircumstance.  .  .  .  Thus our antiquity divides itself into\nthree great parts, which will be our rule in describing this\nwork.  The circle at Abury, the forepart of the snake leading\ntoward Kennet, which I call Kennet Avenue; the hinder part of the\nsnake leading toward Beckhampton, which I call Beckhampton\nAvenue; for they may be well looked on as avenues to the great\ntemple at Abury, which part must be most eminently called the\nTemple.",
        "“The plan on which Abury was built, is that sacred hierogram of\nthe Egyptians and other ancient nations, the circle and snake. \nThe whole figure is the circle, snake, and wings.  By this they\nmeant to picture out, as well as they could, the nature of the\nDivinity.”",
        "The temple which represents the body of the snake is formed by a\ncircular agger of earth having its ditch withinside.  As this is\ncontrary to the mode adopted in works of defence, it is thought\nto prove the religious character of Abury.  In a description\ngiven of this shrine by Higgins is the following:",
        "“These ramparts inclose an area of 1400 feet in diameter, which\non the edge nearest the ditch was set round with a row of rough,\nunhewn stones, and in the center was ornamented with two circular\ntemples, composed of the same native stones.\"[159]",

It is almost perfectly round, much resembling\na huge orange, and so nicely balanced on a table of stone as to\nbe easily set in motion by a single man, providing the operator\nexerts his strength on the north or south sides.  On either of\nthe other sides the combined strength of forty elephants would\nnot be sufficient to cause the least oscillation.

        "Many writers have endeavored to prove that these towers were\nbelfries used in connection with Christian churches; others that\nthey were purgatorial columns or penitential heights, similar in\ndesign to the pillar of St. Simeon Stylites.  Others again have\nargued that they were used as beacons and others that they were\nintended simply as receptacles for the sacred fire known to have\nformerly been in use in the British Isles.  Although numberless\narguments have been brought forward to refute these theories, it\nis thought that the expensive architecture alone of the elegant\nand stately columns known as Round Towers contradicts all these\n\"guesses,” and that their grandeur and almost absolute\nindestructibility proclaim for them a different origin from that\nof the lowly and miserable huts which in a later age were erected\nbeside them for purposes of worship by the Romish Christians. \nThe same objection is made also against the theory that these\nmonuments were erected in memory of the several defeats of the\nDanes.  As an answer to the argument that they were erected by\nthe Danes to celebrate their victories, it is declared that such\nis the character of the hieroglyphics upon them as to make this\ntheory worthless.  Besides, throughout the country of the Danes\nand Ostmen, there is nowhere to be found an example of\narchitectural splendor such as is displayed in the construction\nof these columns.  In the north of Scotland was one of these\nmonuments upon which were depicted war-like scenes, horses and\ntheir riders, warriors brandishing their weapons, and troops\nshouting for victory, while on the other side was a sumptuous\ncross, beneath which were two figures, the one evidently female,\nthe other male.",

In the devastating wars\nwhich swept over Persia and the other countries of antiquity\nprior to the age of the later Zoroaster, the Pish-de danaans were\nvictorious, and, driving from the country the Tuath-de danaans,\nor male worshippers, succeeded in re-establishing, and for a time\nmaintaining, the old form of worship. O’Brien claims that the\nTuath-de-danaans who were expelled from Persia emigrated to\nIreland, and there continued or preserved their favorite form of\nworship, the Round Towers having been erected by them in\nconformity to their peculiar religious views.  This writer\nassures us that the old Irish tongue bears unmistakable evidence\nof the relation existing between these countries.

It is true that by this process\nchildren were born only to be delivered over to the ravages of\nthe fire- god, but by it, was not their deity both served and\nappeased at the same time that population was kept within the\nbounds of subsistence?

        "In India, when a new colony or city was founded, in order to\ninsure its prosperity, large numbers of children were delivered\nover as a bribe or offering of reconciliation to the god of\nvirility.

        "From the records of extant history, it would seem that human\nsacrifice usually accompanies a certain stage of sun-worship.\nAmong the Aztecs in Mexico, a country in which the sun was a\nuniversal object of reverence and in which one of the prescribed\nduties of the boys trained in the temple was that of keeping\nalive the sacred fires, the immolation of victims became the most\nprominent feature of their public worship. We are distinctly\ntold, however, that human sacrifice was not formerly practiced in\nMexico, but that finally here as elsewhere, the idea became\nprevalent that by sacrificing human victims to the god of\nDestruction, his wrath might be appeased and the people saved\nfrom his vengeance.  It is stated that human sacrifices were\nadopted by the Aztecs early in the fourteenth century, about two\nhundred years before the conquest.  “Rare at first, they became\nmore frequent with the wider extent of their empire; till, at\nlength, almost every festival was closed with this cruel\nabomination.”",

Hence, as\nthe Mexicans had not arrived at that stage of religious progress\n(?) at which sensuality inculcated as a sacred duty, and at which\nmoral and physical debasement was encouraged both in public and\nprivate life, we may reasonably conclude that their faith\nrepresents a somewhat earlier stage of development than does that\nof either Jew or Greek.  In point of morality, as judged by the\nmost ancient standards, or by the more modern, the Mexicans\ncompare favorably with either of these nationalities.  Indeed\nwhen we compare the social, religious, and civil conditions of\nMexico as we find them under Montezuma with those of the Jews\nunder David or Solomon, or with those of the Greeks under Solon,\nor even with those of the Christians during the Spanish\nInquisition when thousands upon thousands, not of captives taken\nin war, but of the noblest and best of the land, were yearly\nslaughtered for “the glory of God,” there is quite as much to\nmeet the approval of an enlightened conscience under the first\nnamed system as under that of any one of the other three.",

He was the progenitor of the race.  From\nthis same idea sprang ancestor worship, or the deification of the\npast vital spark.  The adoration paid to the Lares and Penates,\nthe household gods of the Romans, on the first of May, is an\nexample of this worship, as is also the homage paid by the\nChinese to their progenitors.",

Henceforward although man was dead in\ntransgressions, through the cross, or through the crucified\nChrist, he received eternal life.",

But whatever may have been its form, as soon\nas the myths of former religious worship began to attach\nthemselves to his history, he became the symbolical dead man on a\ncross, the original sacrifice to Mahadeva.  He portrayed the same\nidea as did Crishna, Ballaji, the dying Osiris, and all the other\nsun-gods.  He, like each of these, represented a new sun at the\nbeginning of a new cycle.  He was a risen savior, and to him were\nfinally transferred all the festivals, seasons, symbols, and\nmonograms of former solar deities.  That the figure of a dead man\non a cross was a familiar emblem throughout Asia and various\nportions of Europe, and that numberless crucified\ngods–incarnations of the sun–have been worshipped throughout\nthe East, is a fact which it has been the aim of the initiated\namong the Christian clergy to conceal, but one which no one who\nhas examined the evidence with a mind free from prejudice\nattempts to deny.",
        "In Italy, on many of the earlier pictures of Christ, may be\nobserved the words Deo Soli, which inscription signifies either\n\"to the only God,” or “to the God Sol.”",
        "Of the various so-called Christian antiquities which cover the\nwalls of the Vatican, we are assured by those who have acquainted\nthemselves with the signification of pagan symbolism that “they\nhave no more reference to Christianity than they have to the\nEmperor of China.”   The same may be said with reference to the\nrepresentations on the walls of the Catacombs.",
        "Crishna, who was the equinoctial sun in Aries, appeared 2160\nyears after the first Buddha, who was the equinoctial sun in\nTaurus.  According to Plutarch they were both modern gods when\ncompared with the deities which gave names to the planets. \nBuddha, or the sun in Taurus, was worshipped in the form of a\nbull.  Crishna, or the sun in Aries, was adored under the figure\nof a ram with a man’s head.  The true significance of these\nfigures was the fructifying sun or reproductive energy as\nmanifested in animal life, and this meaning to those who\nworshipped them was identical with the carved figures on the\ncaves of India, the Lares and Penates of the Romans, and the\nstone pillars or crosses in the market-places and at the\nintersection of roads in Brittany.",
        "Eusebius says that at Elephanta they adored a Deity in the figure\nof a man in a sitting posture painted blue, having the head of a\nram with the horns of a goat encircling a disk.  The Deity thus\ndescribed is said to be of astronomical origin, denoting the\npower of the sun in Aries.",
        "This figure, which was one of the representations of the sun-god\nCrishna, was worshipped both in India and in Egypt.  In various\nof the manifestations of this Deity he appears in the act of\nkilling a serpent.  He was the dead man on a cross and also the\nsun, which although continually dying is constantly being revived\nagain.  Various incarnations of this God have appeared as\ncrucified saviors.",
        "Of the avatar of Crishna known as Ballaji or Baal-Jah little is\npositively known.  Indeed there seems to be some impenetrable\nmystery surrounding this figure, which makes it impossible for\nscholars to absolutely prove that which by means of the evidence\nat hand amounts almost to a certainty.",
        "A print by Moore of this god represents him in the shape of a\nRomish crucifix, but although there is a nail hole in his foot he\nis not transfixed to a wooden cross.  Instead of a crown of\nthorns a Parthian coronet encircles his head.  As all the avatars\nof Crishna are represented with coronets, this fact has caused\nseveral writers to observe that the effigies of Ballaji have\nfurnished the copies for the thorn-crowned Jesus.  Through the\nignorance of the early Christians who in the second century\nadopted the religion of Crishna, the true significance of this\ncoronet was not understood, hence the thorns upon the head of\nChrist.  In referring to the effigy of a crucified savior found\nin Ireland the author of The Round Towers says that it was not\nintended for our Savior for the reason that it wore the Iranian\nregal crown, instead of the Jewish crown of thorns.[171]",
        "[171] The Round Towers of Ireland, p. 298.",
        "Regarding this effigy, Higgins remarks that the crucified body\nwithout the cross reminds one that “some of the ancient sects of\nheretics held Jesus to have been crucified in the clouds.”",
        "Moore, who has produced several prints of Ballaji, says he is\nunable to account for the pierced foot of a crucified figure in\nIndia.  He endeavors to prove, however, that this crucifix cannot\nbe Hindoo “because there are duplicates of it from the same\nmodel.”   As the mould is made of clay, he contends that only one\ncast may be made from it.  This argument falls to the ground,\nhowever, so soon as it is found that duplicates, or copies of\nthese brass idols which may not be distinguished from the\noriginals, are seen in the museum at the India House, and also in\nthat of the Asiatic Society.",
        "The admission of Moore that “great influence was brought to bear\nupon him to induce him not to publish the prints of Ballaji for\nfear of giving offense,” serves as a hint in determining the\ncause for the lack of information respecting this god.",
        "It is believed that, were the development of truth upon this\nsubject rather than its concealment the object of Christian\nmissionaries, the temples of Ballaji would have furnished more\nimportant information to the Christian world than would those of\nany other of the Hindoo gods; but while numberless pilgrimages\nhave been made to Juggernaut and other shrines devoid of interest\nto the student, we have heard little concerning the shrines of\nthis deity, although at the time Moore wrote, Terputty was in the\npossession of the English who made a profit of L15,000 a year\nfrom the temple.",
        "On the Brechin Tower in Ireland are two arches one within the\nother in relief.  At the top of the arch is a crucifix, and about\nmidway from top to bottom on either side are two figures which,\naccording to Romanist Christians, represent the Virgin Mary and\nSt. John.  At the bottom of the outer arch are two couchant\nbeasts, the one an elephant and the other a bull.  The figure on\nthe cross has a Parthian coronet.  The appearance of a crucifix\non the towers of Britain and Ireland has in the past led many\nwriters to ascribe to these singular structures a Christian\norigin.  To the critical observer, however, the first question\nwhich presents itself is whence comes the elephant–an animal not\nfound within these countries?–and again why should these beasts\nhave been placed here as Christian emblems? The facts in the case\nas revealed by unprejudiced investigators are, that the towers in\nIreland are not Christian monuments, and that the crucifix found\non them is not that of Christ but of Ballaji, or of some one of\nthe avatars of Crishna.",
        "The fact that the figure of Crishna as a crucified god was found\nin the ruins of a temple at Thebes in Egypt, is sufficient to\nprove his antiquity; still, as we have seen, he represents the\ngod-idea at a much later date than did Buddha.  Regarding the\nevidence furnished by the Rev. Mr. Maurice of the ten avatars of\nthe Indian sun-god, Higgins observes:",
        "“The only fact worthy of notice here is, that Buddha was\nuniversally allowed to be the first of the incarnations; that\nCrishna was of later date; that, at the era of the birth of\nChrist, eight of them had appeared on the earth, and that the\nother two were expected to follow before the end of the Caliyug,\nor of the present age.”",
        "With reference to the fact that the Hindoo God originally\nrepresented Wisdom or the Logos, the same writer says:",
        "“Then here is DIVINE WISDOM incarnate, of whom the Bull of the\nZodiac was the emblem.  HERE he is the Protagonos, or first\nbegotten, the God or Goddess Mhtis of the Greeks, being, perhaps,\nboth male and female.  Buddha, or the wise, if the word were not\nmerely the name of a doctrine, seems to have been an appellation\ntaken by several persons, or one person incarnate at several\nperiods, and from this circumstance much confusion has\narisen.\"[172]",
        "[172] Anacalypsis, book v., p. 201.",
        "Concerning the religion of an ancient race the following facts\nhave been ascertained, namely:",
        "The first of the Buddhas or Incarnations of the Deity was\nMinerva, and her mother, who was the sun, was the mother of all\nthe Buddhas.  She was Mhtis, Mubt or Mai, “the universal genius\nof Nature, who discriminated all things according to their\nvarious kinds of species.”",
        "In the earliest ages she comprehended not only matter but the\nmoving force in the universe.  She was the Deity which by a very\nancient race was represented by the mother idea–Perceptive\nWisdom.  She was the sun and the first emanation from the sun. \nShe was the Divine Word, the Logos, the Holy Ghost which in the\ntime of Christ was again by various sects recognized as female. \nThe allegory of the Greeks concerning Jupiter taking Mhtis\n(Wisdom) to wife and from this union with her producing Minerva\nfrom his head, is seen to be closely connected with the doctrine\nof Buddha (Wisdom) or of the Rasit of Genesis.  According to\nFaber, the import of the Greek word Nous and of the Sanscrit Menu\nis precisely the same: each denotes mind or intelligence, and to\nthe latter of them the Latin Mens is nearly allied.  “Mens, Menu,\nand perhaps our English mind are fundamentally one and the same\nword.”  All these terms in an earlier age meant Buddha, Wisdom,\nor Minerva.",
        "Later, with the worship of the sun in Aries, appeared a crucified\nsavior.  During the earlier ages of Crishnaism, the ideas\ntypified by a dying savior were still those pertaining to the\nprocesses of Nature.  Matter was still believed to be\nindestructible and seeming death but a preparation for renewed\nlife, or for birth into another state of existence Subsequently\nthis dying sun-god, which disappeared in winter only to return\nagain to re-animate Nature, became a veritable man–a man on a\ncross who must be sacrificed to Mahadeva in order that humanity\nmight be saved.  Here we have the origin of the doctrine of a\nVicarious Atonement.  Later, under the system called\nChristianity, woman, who had previously become identified with\nthe evil principle, became the Tempter.  She was the cause of sin\nin the world and wholly responsible for the evil results arising\nfrom desire.  Indeed, according to the doctrines annunciated by\nthe Christian Church, had woman, who was an after thought of the\nAlmighty, never been created, man would have lived forever in a\nstate of purity and bliss, free alike from the toils, pains, and\ntemptations of life, and from the crafts and assaults of the\nDevil.",
        "Through the over-stimulation of the animal instincts man had\nbecome wholly unable to overcome the evil in his constitution,\nhence the adoption of the doctrine of Original Sin and the\nnecessity for an Atonement, or for a crucified savior, who would\ntake upon himself the sins of poor, weak human nature.  By simply\nbelieving on this crucified redeemer, man would be saved, not\nfrom sin itself, but from the penalty of sin.  To bolster up the\nbelief in original sin and the necessity for an atonement, the\nallegory of the fruit tree and the serpent in Genesis was taken\nliterally.",
        "The more the religion of the past is studied the more plainly\nwill the fact appear, that not only have the ceremonies, symbols,\nfestivals, and seasons adopted by Christianity been copied from\nIndia and Persia, but also that all the leading doctrines of the\nso-called Christian Church originated in those countries.  The\nbelief in a Trinity, the Incarnation of the Deity, a Crucified\nSavior, Original Sin and a Vicarious Atonement, the last three\nhaving been elaborated after the ancient natural truths\nunderlying sun worship had been forgotten, are all to be found in\nthe East.",
        "The doctrine of a Trinity is supposed to have been received\ndirectly from the Platonists, who had learned it from the\nPersians; while that of a Crucified Savior, and also that of the\nseed of the woman bruising the serpent’s head, belong, as we have\nseen, to the religion of Crishna.",
        "Concerning Original Sin, which is the foundation of the doctrine\nof the “Atonement,” it is plain that it was not known to the\nearlier followers of Christ, but that it was subsequently copied\nfrom the corrupted religion of the Hindoos.",
        "The symbolical meaning of the serpent and the Tree of Life was\ndoubtless understood by the earliest adherents to the Christian\nfaith; it is not surprising, therefore, that by them there is no\nmention of the doctrine of Original Sin.  Their theory to account\nfor evil in the world was the same as that of an ancient and\nalmost forgotten race.  The belief that the soul of man is a\nspark from, or a part of the universal soul, that at the death of\nthe body it returns to its source, and in process of time appears\nas the animating principle in other bodies, was believed by\nPythagoras, Aspasia, Socrates, and Plato and, in fact, for\nthousands of years it was entertained by the best and wisest of\nthe human race.  It was a part of the early Christian doctrine\nand is still believed by the followers of Buddha and by the\nTheosophists of Europe and America.",
        "Doubtless the doctrines of Re-incarnation and Karma were set\nforth by those very ancient philosophers who were the near\ndescendants of the inventors of the Neros and the Metonic\ncycle–those who believed in the indestructibility of matter, and\nthat spirit proceeds from or is evolved through it.  It was an\neffort on their part to solve the problem of the existence of\nevil, and was far more satisfactory to the reasoning mind than\nwas the literal translation of the story of the woman, the\nforbidden apple, and the talking serpent in Genesis.",
        "Original sin of which woman is said to be the cause, and the\nnecessity for a spiritual (male) savior to deliver man from the\nwretchedness which she had produced, are doctrines which took\ntheir rise in the grossest ignorance, and in an entire\nmisconception of the natural truths which had previously been set\nforth by the figure of a dying sun-god.  Original Sin and a\nVicarious Atonement–doctrines by means of which man has\nattempted to evade moral responsibility and the legitimate\nresults of evil-doing–have, by weakening his moral sense, and by\nshifting the responsibility of his deeds upon another, resulted\nin greatly lowering the standard of human conduct.",
        "Science teaches that the penalty for sin is inherent in it, and\nthat virtue is its own reward; the so-called Christian doctrines\nassert that although a man’s sins be as scarlet, they may, simply\nthrough a certain belief, become white as wool.  It has been\nclaimed that a belief in original sin caused all the human\nsacrifices in ancient times and that it “converted the Jews into\na nation of cannibals.”",
        "That the system which has borne the name of Christianity is an\noutgrowth of Sun, Serpent, and Phallic faiths is so plainly\nproven by the facts brought out by later research as no longer to\nbe a matter of reasonable doubt to those who have given any\nconsiderable degree of attention to this subject.  The more\nexalted ideas which from the time of Zoroaster to that of Jesus\nhad been struggling for existence, and which through various\nmeans had been gradually gaining a foothold, were, by the influx\nof Crishnaism, soon choked out, and mythical Christianity, which\nwas but a gathering in of the grosser forms of the prevailing\nHindoo faith, mounted the throne of the Roman Empire.",
        "During the nineteen hundred years that have elapsed since the\ninauguration of this system, little has been understood\nconcerning the real philosophy of Christ–a philosophy which is\nseen to be simply a recognition of those higher scientific truths\nenunciated by an ancient race.",
        "The fact is observed in these later times that the altruistic\nprinciples involved in these teachings contain the highest\nwisdom–that they form the basis of a true social science, and\nthat a high stage of civilization will never be reached until\nthese principles are recognized as the foundation of human\nconduct Unselfishness, purity of life, and the brotherhood of man\nwill never be realized so long as man shifts the responsibility\nof his wrong-doing upon another.",
        "Quite recently the fact has been proved that the progressive\nprinciple originated in the female constitution; that in\nsympathy, a character which has its root in maternal affection,\nlies the key to human progress.  Conscience and the moral sense\nare outgrowths of sympathy; therefore, that which distinguishes\nman from the lower orders of life originated in and has been\ndeveloped through the female organization.",
        "When these plain scientific truths, which are so simple as\nscarcely to need demonstration, become popularized, doubtless our\npresent god-idea will undergo a process of reconstruction, and\nthe later development will probably involve conceptions more in\nkeeping with science and human reason.  Surely a scientific age\nwill tolerate no religious conception whose principles are not\nfounded on truth.  The worship of a male god as the sole creator\nand sustainer of the universe is as unphilosophical as it is\nunreasonable and unscientific.",
        "As in many ways at the present time, mankind seems inclined to\nretrace its steps, and as upon its onward march humanity is\nbeginning to manifest a willingness to return to truer and more\nprimitive methods of thought and action, it is not impossible\nthat in the not distant future, Perceptive Wisdom and the\naltruistic principles, together with the power to give life, may\nagain be divinely enthroned in the place so long usurped by\nphysical force and virile might.",
