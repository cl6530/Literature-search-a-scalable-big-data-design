        "In the following notes I give first the source whence I\nobtained the various tales. Then come parallels in some fulness\nfor the United Kingdom, but only a single example for foreign\ncountries, with a bibliographical reference where further variants can\nbe found. Finally, a few remarks are sometimes added where the\ntale seems to need it. In two cases (Nos. xvi. and xxi.) I have been\nmore full.",
        "Source.–Unearthed by Mr. E. Clodd from the “Suffolk Notes and\nQueries” of the Ipswich Journal, and reprinted by him in a\npaper on “The Philosophy of Rumpelstiltskin” in Folk-Lore\nJournal, vii. 138-43. I have reduced the Suffolk dialect.",
        "Parallels.–In Yorkshire this occurs as “Habetrot and Scantlie\nMab,” in Henderson’s Folk-Lore of Northern Counties, 221-6; in\nDevonshire as “Duffy and the Devil” in Hunt’s Romances and Drolls\nof the West of England, 239-47; in Scotland two variants are given\nby Chambers, Popular Rhymes of Scotland, under the title\n“Whuppity Stourie.” The “name-guessing wager” is also found in\n“Peerifool”, printed by Mr. Andrew Lang in Longman’s Magazine,\nJuly 1889, also Folk-Lore, September, 1890. It is clearly the\nsame as Grimm’s “Rumpelstiltskin” (No. 14); for other Continental\nparallels see Mr. Clodd’s article, and Cosquin, Contes pop. de\nLorraine, i. 269 seq.",
        "Remarks.–One of the best folk-tales that have ever been\ncollected, far superior to any of the continental variants of this\ntale with which I am acquainted. Mr. Clodd sees in the class of name-\nguessing stories, a “survival” of the superstition that to know a\nman’s name gives you power over him, for which reason savages object\nto tell their names. It may be necessary, I find, to explain to the\nlittle ones that Tom Tit can only be referred to as “that,” because\nhis name is not known till the end.",
        "Source.–From Folk-Lore Journal, ii. 40-3; to which it\nwas communicated by Miss C. Burne.",
        "Parallels.–Prof. Stephens gave a variant from his own memory\nin Folk-Lore Record, iii. 155, as told in Essex at the beginning\nof the century. Mr. Toulmin Smith gave another version in The\nConstitutional, July 1, 1853, which was translated by his daughter,\nand contributed to Mélusine, t. ii. An Oxfordshire version was\ngiven in Notes and Queries, April 17, 1852. It occurs also in Ireland,\nKennedy, Fireside Stories, p. 9. It is Grimm’s Kluge Else, No. 34,\nand is spread through the world. Mr. Clouston devotes the seventh\nchapter of his Book of Noodles to the Quest of the Three Noodles.",
        "Source.–From the first edition of Henderson’s Folk-Lore of\nNorthern Counties, p. 314, to which it was communicated by the\nRev. S. Baring-Gould.",
        "Parallels.–This is better known under the title, “Orange and\nLemon,” and with the refrain:",
        "  “My mother killed me,\n  My father picked my bones,\n  My little sister buried me,\n  Under the marble stones.”",
        "I heard this in Australia. Mr. Jones Gives part of it in Folk Tales\nof the Magyars, 418-20, and another version occurs in 4 Notes\nand Queries, vi. 496. Mr. I. Gollancz informs me he remembers a\nversion entitled “Pepper, Salt, and Mustard,” with the refrain just\ngiven. Abroad it is Grimm’s “Juniper Tree” (No. 47), where see further\nparallels. The German rhyme is sung by Margaret in the mad scene of\nGoethe’s “Faust.”",
        "Source.–Halliwell’s Nursery Rhymes and Tales, 114.",
        "Parallels.–Cf. Miss Burne, Shropshire Folk-Lore,\n529; also No. xxxiv. infra (\"Cat and Mouse”). It occurs also in\nScotch, with the title “The Wife and her Bush of Berries,” Chambers’s\nPop. Rhymes, p. 57. Newell, Games and Songs of American\nChildren, gives a game named “Club-fist” (No. 75), founded on\nthis, and in his notes refers to German, Danish, and Spanish variants.\n(Cf. Cosquin, ii. 36 seq.)",
        "Remarks.–One of the class of Accumulative stories, which are\nwell represented in England. (Cf. infra, Nos. xvi., xx.,\nxxxiv.)",
        "Source.–American Folk-Lore Journal I, 227-8. I have\neliminated a malodorous and un-English skunk.",
        "Parallels.–Two other versions are given in the Journal\nl.c. One of these, however, was probably derived from Grimm’s\n“Town Musicians of Bremen” (No. 27). That the others came from across\nthe Atlantic is shown by the fact that it occurs in Ireland (Kennedy,\nFictions, pp. 5-10) and Scotland (Campbell, No. 11). For other\nvariants, see R. Köhler in Gonzenbach, Sicil. Märchen, ii. 245.",
        "Source.–Halliwell, p. 149.",
        "Parallels.–This is the Hans im Glück of Grimm (No. 83).\nCf. too, “Lazy Jack,” infra, No. xxvii. Other variants are given by\nM. Cosquin, Contes pop. de Lorraine, i. 241. On surprising robbers,\nsee preceding tale.",
        "Remarks.–In some of the variants the door is carried, because\nMr. Vinegar, or his equivalent, has been told to “mind the door,” or\nhe acts on the principle “he that is master of the door is master of\nthe house.” In other stories he makes the foolish exchanges to the\nentire satisfaction of his wife. (Cf. Cosquin, i. 156-7.)",
        "Source.–From a Scotch tale, “Nicht Nought Nothing,” collected\nby Mr. Andrew Lang in Morayshire, published by him first in Revue\nCeltique, t. iii; then in his Custom and Myth, p. 89; and\nagain in Folk-Lore, Sept. 1890. I have changed the name so as\nto retain the équivoque of the giant’s reply to the King. I\nhave also inserted the incidents of the flight, the usual ones in\ntales of this type, and expanded the conclusion, which is very\ncurtailed and confused in the original. The usual ending of tales of\nthis class contains the “sale of bed” incident, for which see Child,\ni. 391.",
        "Parallels.–Mr. Lang, in the essay “A Far-travelled Tale” in\nwhich he gives the story, mentions several variants of it, including\nthe classical myth of Jason and Medea. A fuller study in Cosquin,\nl.c., ii. 12-28. For the finger ladder, see Köhler, in Orient and\nOccident, ii. III.",
        "Source.–Henderson’s Folk-Lore of Northern Counties\n(first edition), p. 319. Communicated by the Rev. S. Baring-Gould.",
        "Parallels.–\"Pilgrims from Paradise” are enumerated in\nClouston’s Book of Noodles, pp. 205, 214-8. See also Cosquin,\nl.c., i. 239.",
        "Source.–From the ballad of the “Twa Sisters o’ Binnorie.” I\nhave used the longer version in Roberts’s Legendary Ballads,\nwith one or two touches from Mr. Allingham’s shorter and more powerful\nvariant in The Ballad Book. A tale is the better for length, a\nballad for its curtness.",
        "Parallels.–The story is clearly that of Grimm’s “Singing Bone\"\n(No. 28), where one brother slays the other and buries him under a\nbush. Years after a shepherd passing by finds a bone under the bush,\nand, blowing through this, hears the bone denounce the murderer. For\nnumerous variants in Ballads and Folk Tales, see Prof. Child’s\nEnglish and Scotch Ballads (ed. 1886), i. 125, 493; iii. 499.",
        "Source.–From memory by Mrs. E. Burne-Jones.",
        "Parallels.–A fragment is given in Halliwell, 43; Chambers’s\nPopular Rhymes has a Scotch version, “The Cattie sits in the\nKilnring spinning” (p. 53). The surprise at the end, similar to that\nin Perrault’s “Red Riding Hood,” is a frequent device in English folk\ntales. (Cf. infra, Nos. xii., xxiv., xxix., xxxiii., xli.)",
        "Source.–Discovered by Mr. E. Clodd, in “Suffolk Notes and\nQueries” of the Ipswich Journal, published by Mr. Lang in\nLonginan’s Magazine, vol. xiii, also in Folk-Lore, Sept.\n1890.",
        "Parallels.–The beginning recalls “King Lear.” For “loving like\nsalt,” see the parallels collected by Cosquin, i. 288. The whole story\nis a version of the numerous class of Cinderella stories, the\nparticular variety being the Catskin sub-species analogous to\nPerrault’s Peau d’Ane. “Catskin” was told by Mr. Burchell to\nthe young Primroses in “The Vicar of Wakefield,’” and has been\nelaborately studied by the late H. C. Coote, in Folk-Lore\nRecord, iii. 1-25. It is only now extant in ballad form, of which\n“Cap o’ Rushes” may be regarded as a prose version.",
        "Source.–Halliwell, 148.",
        "Source.–I tell this as it was told me in Australia, somewhere\nabout the year 1860.",
        "Parallels.–There is a chap-book version which is very poor; it\nis given by Mr. E. S. Hartland, English Folk and Fairy Tales\n(Camelot Series), p. 35, seq. In this, when Jack arrives at the\ntop of the Beanstalk, he is met by a fairy, who gravely informs him\nthat the ogre had stolen all his possessions from Jack’s father. The\nobject of this was to prevent the tale becoming an encouragement to\ntheft! I have had greater confidence in my young friends, and have\ndeleted the fairy who did not exist in the tale as told to me. For the\nBeanstalk elsewhere, see Ralston, Russian Folk Tales, 293-8.\nCosquin has some remarks on magical ascents (i. 14).",
        "Source.–Halliwell, p. 16.",
        "Parallels.–The only known parallels are one from Venice,\nBernoni, Trad. Pop., punt. iii. p. 65, given in Crane, Italian Popular\nTales, p. 267, “The Three Goslings;” and a negro tale in Lippincott’s\nMagazine, December, 1877, p. 753 (\"Tiny Pig”).",
        "Remarks.–As little pigs do not have hair on their chinny chin-\nchins, I suspect that they were originally kids, who have. This would\nbring the tale close to the Grimms’ “Wolf and Seven Little Kids,” (No.\n5). In Steel and Temple’s “Lambikin” (Wide-awake Stories, p.\n71), the Lambikin gets inside a Drumikin, and so nearly escapes the\njackal.",
        "Source.–Henderson, Folk-Lore of Northern Counties,\nfirst edition, p. 343, communicated by the Rev. S. Baring-Gould. The\nrhymes on the open book have been supplied by Mr. Batten, in whose\nfamily, if I understand him rightly, they have been long used for\nraising the––; something similar occurs in Halliwell, p. 243, as a\nriddle rhyme. The mystic signs in Greek are a familiar “counting-out\nrhyme”: these have been studied in a monograph by Mr. H. C. Bolton; he\nthinks they are “survivals” of incantations. Under the circumstances,\nit would be perhaps as well if the reader did not read the lines out\nwhen alone. One never knows what may happen.",
        "Parallels.–Sorcerers’ pupils seem to be generally selected for\ntheir stupidity–in folk-tales. Friar Bacon was defrauded of his\nlabour in producing the Brazen Head in a similar way. In one of the\nlegends about Virgil he summoned a number of demons, who would have\ntorn him to pieces if he had not set them at work (J. S. Tunison,\nMaster Virgil, Cincinnati, 1888, p. 30).",
        "Source.–Halliwell, p. 115.",
        "Parallels.–This curious droll is extremely widespread;\nreferences are given in Cosquin, i. 204 seq., and Crane,\nItalian Popular Tales, 375-6. As a specimen I may indicate what\nis implied throughout these notes by such bibliographical references\nby drawing up a list of the variants of this tale noticed by these two\nauthorities, adding one or two lately printed. Various versions have\nbeen discovered in:",

        "Remarks.–These 25 variants of the same jingle scattered over\nthe world from India to Spain, present the problem of the diffusion of\nfolk-tales in its simplest form. No one is likely to contend with\nProf. Müller and Sir George Cox, that we have here the detritus of\narchaic Aryan mythology, a parody of a sun-myth. There is little that\nis savage and archaic to attract the school of Dr. Tylor, beyond the\nspeaking powers of animals and inanimates. Yet even Mr. Lang is not\nlikely to hold that these variants arose by coincidence and\nindependently in the various parts of the world where they have been\nfound. The only solution is that the curious succession of incidents\nwas invented once for all at some definite place and time by some\ndefinite entertainer for children, and spread thence through all the\nOld World. In a few instances we can actually trace the passage-\ne.g., the Shetland version was certainly brought over from\nHamburg. Whether the centre of dispersion was India or not, it is\nimpossible to say, as it might have spread east from Smyrna (Hahn, No.\n56). Benfey (Einleitung zu Pantschatantra, i. 190-91) suggests\nthat this class of accumulative story may be a sort of parody on the\nIndian stories, illustrating the moral, “what great events from small\noccasions rise.” Thus, a drop of honey falls on the ground; a fly goes\nafter it, a bird snaps at the fly, a dog goes for the bird, another\ndog goes for the first, the masters of the two dogs–who happen to be\nkings–quarrel and go to war, whole provinces are devastated, and all\nfor a drop of honey! “Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse” also ends in a\nuniversal calamity which seems to arise from a cause of no great\nimportance. Benfey’s suggestion is certainly ingenious, but perhaps\ntoo ingenious to be true.",
        "Source.-Mr. F. Hindes Groome, In Gipsy Tents, p. 201\nseq. I have eliminated a superfluous Gipsy who makes her\nappearance towards the end of the tale à propos des boltes, but\notherwise have left the tale unaltered as one of the few English folk-\ntales that have been taken down from the mouths of the peasantry: this\napplies also to i., ii., xi.",
        "Parallels.-There is a magic snuff-box with a friendly power in\nit in Kennedy’s Fictions of the Irish Celts, p. 49. The choice\nbetween a small cake with a blessing, &c., is frequent (cf. No.\nxxiii.), but the closest parallel to the whole story, including the\nmice, is afforded by a tale in Carnoy and Nicolaides’ Traditions\npopulaires de l’Asie Mineure, which is translated as the first\ntale in Mr. Lang’s Blue Fairy Book. There is much in both that\nis similar to Aladdin, I beg his pardon, Allah-ed-din.",
        "Source.–Verbatim et literatim from Southey, The\nDoctor, &c., quarto edition, p. 327.",
        "Parallels.–None, as the story was invented by Southey. There\nis an Italian translation, I tre Orsi, Turin, 1868, and it\nwould be curious to see if the tale ever acclimatises itself in Italy.",
        "Remarks.–\"The Three Bears” is the only example I know of where\na tale that can be definitely traced to a specific author has become a\nfolk-tale. Not alone is this so, but the folk has developed the tale\nin a curious and instructive way, by substituting a pretty little girl\nwith golden locks for the naughty old woman. In Southey’s version\nthere is nothing of Little Silverhair as the heroine: she seems to\nhave been introduced in a metrical version by G. N., much be-praised\nby Southey. Silverhair seems to have become a favourite, and in Mrs.\nValentine’s version of “The Three Bears,” in “The Old, Old Fairy\nTales,” the visit to the bear-house is only the preliminary to a long\nsuccession of adventures of the pretty little girl, of which there is\nno trace in the original (and this in “The Old, Old Fairy Tales.” Oh!\nMrs. Valentine!). I have, though somewhat reluctantly, cast back to\nthe original form. After all, as Prof. Dowden remarks, Southey’s\nmemory is kept alive more by “The Three Bears” than anything else, and\nthe text of such a nursery classic should be retained in all its\npurity.",
        "Source.–From two chap-books at the British Museum (London,\n1805, Paisley, 1814). I have taken some hints from “Felix Summerly’s\"\n(Sir Henry Cole’s) version, 1845. From the latter part, I have removed\nthe incident of the Giant dragging the lady along by her hair.",
        "Parallels.–The chap-book of “Jack the Giant-Killer” is a\ncurious jumble. The second part, as in most chap-books, is a weak and\nlate invention of the enemy, and is not volkstümlich at all.\nThe first part is compounded of a comic and a serious theme. The first\nis that of the Valiant Tailor (Grimm, No. 20); to this belong the\nincidents of the fleabite blows (for variants of which see Köhler in\nJahrb. rom. eng. Phil., viii. 252), and that of the slit paunch\n(cf. Cosquin, l.c., ii. 51). The Thankful Dead episode,\nwhere the hero is assisted by the soul of a person whom he has caused\nto be buried, is found as early as the Cento novelle antiche\nand Straparola, xi. 2. It has been best studied by Köhler in\nGermania, iii. 199-209 (cf. Cosquin, i. 214-5; ii. 14 and note;\nand Crane, Ital. Pop. Tales, 350, note 12). It occurs also in the\ncurious play of Peele’s The Old Wives’ Tale, in which one of the\ncharacters is the Ghost of Jack. Practically the same story as this part\nof Jack the Giant-Killer occurs in Kennedy, Fictions of the Irish Celts,\np. 32, “Jack the Master and Jack the Servant;” and Kennedy adds (p. 38),\n“In some versions Jack the Servant is the spirit of the buried man.”",
        "The “Fee-fi-fo-fum” formula is common to all English stories of giants\nand ogres; it also occurs in Peele’s play and in King Lear (see\nnote on “Childe Rowland”). Messrs. Jones and Kropf have some remarks\non it in their “Magyar Tales,” pp. 340-1; so has Mr. Lang in his\n“Perrault,” p. lxiii., where he traces it to the Furies in Aeschylus’\nEumenides.",
        "Source.–I give this as it was told me in Australia in 1860.\nThe fun consists in the avoidance of all pronouns, which results in\njaw-breaking sentences almost equal to the celebrated “She stood at\nthe door of the fish-sauce shop, welcoming him in.”",
        "Parallels.–Halliwell, p. 151, has the same with the title\n“Chicken-Licken.” It occurs also in Chambers’s Popular Rhymes,\np. 59, with the same names of the dramatis personae, as my\nversion. For European parallels, see Crane, Ital. Pop. Tales,\n377, and authorities there quoted.",
        "Source.–Jamieson’s Illustrations of Northern\nAntiquities, 1814, p. 397 seq., who gives it as told by a\ntailor in his youth, c. 1770. I have Anglicised the Scotticisms,\neliminated an unnecessary ox-herd and swine-herd, who lose their\nheads for directing the Childe, and I have called the Erlkönig’s lair the\n Dark Tower on the strength of the description and of Shakespeare’s\nreference. I have likewise suggested a reason why Burd Ellen fell into\nhis power, chiefly in order to introduce a definition of “widershins.\"\n“All the rest is the original horse,” even including the erroneous\ndescription of the youngest son as the Childe or heir (cf. “Childe\nHarold” and Childe Wynd, infra, No. xxxiii.), unless this is some\n“survival” of Junior Right or “Borough English,” the archaic custom of\nletting the heirship pass to the youngest son. I should add that, on the\nstrength of the reference to Merlin, Jamieson calls Childe Rowland’s\nmother, Queen Guinevere, and introduces references to King Arthur\nand his Court. But as he confesses that these are his own improvements\non the tailor’s narrative I have eliminated them.",
        "Parallels.–The search for the Dark Tower is similar to that of\nthe Red Ettin, (cf. Köhler on Gonzenbach, ii. 222). The formula\n“youngest best,” in which the youngest of three brothers succeeds\nafter the others have failed, is one of the most familiar in folk-\ntales amusingly parodied by Mr. Lang in his Prince Prigio. The\ntaboo against taking food in the underworld occurs in the myth of\nProserpine, and is also frequent in folk-tales (Child, i. 322). But\nthe folk-tale parallels to our tale fade into insignificance before\nits brilliant literary relationships. There can be little doubt that\nEdgar, in his mad scene in King Lear, is alluding to our tale\nwhen he breaks into the lines:",
        "“Childe Rowland to the Dark Tower came....” His word was still: “Fie,\nfoh and fum, I smell the blood of a British man.” King Lear,\nact iii. sc. 4, ad fin.",
        "[Footnote: “British” for “English.” This is one of the points that\nsettles the date of the play; James I. was declared King of Great\nBritain, October 1604. I may add that Motherwell in his\nMinstrelsy, p. xiv. note, testifies that the story was still\nextant in the nursery at the time he wrote (1828).]",
        "The latter reference is to the cry of the King of Elfland. That some\nsuch story was current in England in Shakespeare’s time, is proved by\nthat curious mélange of nursery tales, Peele’s The Old Wives’ Tale.\nThe main plot of this is the search of two brothers, Calypha and Thelea,\nfor a lost sister, Delia, who has been bespelled by a sorcerer, Sacrapant\n(the names are taken from the “Orlando Furioso”). They are instructed by\nan old man (like Merlin in “Childe Rowland”) how to rescue their sister,\nand ultimately succeed. The play has besides this the themes of the\nThankful Dead, the Three Heads of the Well (which see), the Life\nIndex, and a transformation, so that it is not to be wondered at if some\nof the traits of “Childe Rowland” are observed in it.",
        "But a still closer parallel is afforded by Milton’s Comus. Here\nagain we have two brothers in search of a sister, who has got into the\npower of an enchanter. But besides this, there is the refusal of the\nheroine to touch the enchanted food, just as Childe Rowland finally\nrefuses. And ultimately the bespelled heroine is liberated by a\nliquid, which is applied to her lips and finger-tips, just as\nChilde Rowland’s brothers are unspelled. Such a minute resemblance as\nthis cannot be accidental, and it is therefore probable that Milton\nused the original form of “Childe Rowland,” or some variant of it, as\nheard in his youth, and adapted it to the purposes of the masque at\nLudlow Castle, and of his allegory. Certainly no other folk-tale in\nthe world can claim so distinguished an offspring.",
        "Remarks.–Distinguished as “Childe Rowland” will be henceforth\nas the origin of Comus, if my affiliation be accepted, it has\neven more remarkable points of interest, both in form and matter, for\nthe folklorist, unless I am much mistaken. I will therefore touch upon\nthese points, reserving a more detailed examination for another\noccasion.",
        "First, as to the form of the narrative. This begins with verse, then\nturns to prose, and throughout drops again at intervals into poetry in\na friendly way like Mr. Wegg. Now this is a form of writing not\nunknown in other branches of literature, the cante-fable, of\nwhich “Aucassin et Nicolette” is the most distinguished example. Nor\nis the cante-fable confined to France. Many of the heroic\nverses of the Arabs contained in the Hamâsa would be unintelligible\nwithout accompanying narrative, which is nowadays preserved in the\ncommentary. The verses imbedded in the Arabian Nights give\nthem something of the character of a cante-fable, and the same\nmay be said of the Indian and Persian story-books, though the verse is\nusually of a sententious and moral kind, as in the gâthas of the\nBuddhist Jatakas. Even as remote as Zanzibar, Mr. Lang notes, the\nfolk-tales are told as cante-fables. There are even traces in the\nOld Testament of such screeds of verse amid the prose narrative, as\nin the story of Lamech or that of Balaam. All this suggests that this is a\nvery early and common form of narrative.",
        "Among folk-tales there are still many traces of the cante-\nfable. Thus, in Grimm’s collection, verses occur in Nos. 1, 5, 11,\n12, 13, 15, 19, 21, 24, 28, 30, 36, 38a, b, 39a, 40, 45, 46, 47,\nout of the first fifty tales, 36 per cent. Of Chambers’ twenty-one\nfolk-tales, in the Popular Rhymes of Scotland only five are\nwithout interspersed verses. Of the forty-three tales contained in this\nvolume, three (ix., xxix., xxxiii.) are derived from ballads and do not\ntherefore count in the present connection. Of the remaining forty, i.,\niii., vii., xvi., xix., xxi., xxiii., xxv., xxxi., xxxv., xxxviii., xli.\n(made up from verses), xliii., contain rhymed lines, while\nxiv., xxii., xxvi., and xxxvii., contain “survivals” of rhymes (\"let\nme come in–chinny chin-chin\"; “once again ... come to Spain;\"\n“it is not so–should be so\"; “and his lady, him behind”); and x.\nand xxxii. are rhythmical if not rhyming. As most of the remainder\nare drolls, which have probably a different origin, there seems to\nbe great probability that originally all folk-tales of a serious character\nwere interspersed with rhyme, and took therefore the form of the\ncante-fable. It is indeed unlikely that the ballad itself began as\ncontinuous verse, and the cante-fable is probably the protoplasm\nout of which both ballad and folk-tale have been differentiated, the\nballad by omitting the narrative prose, the folk-tale by expanding it.\nIn “Childe Rowland” we have the nearest example to such protoplasm,\nand it is not difficult to see how it could have been shortened into\na ballad or reduced to a prose folk-tale pure and simple.",
        "The subject-matter of “Childe Rowland” has also claims on our\nattention especially with regard to recent views on the true nature\nand origin of elves, trolls, and fairies. I refer to the recently\npublished work of Mr. D. MacRitchie, “The Testimony of Tradition\"\n(Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co.)–i.e., of tradition about\nthe fairies and the rest. Briefly put, Mr. MacRitchie’s view is that\nthe elves, trolls, and fairies represented in popular tradition are\nreally the mound-dwellers, whose remains have been discovered in some\nabundance in the form of green hillocks, which have been artificially\nraised over a long and low passage leading to a central chamber open\nto the sky. Mr. MacRitchie shows that in several instances traditions\nabout trolls or “good people” have attached themselves to mounds,\nwhich have afterwards on investigation turned out to be evidently the\nformer residence of men of smaller build than the mortals of to-day.\nHe goes on further to identify these with the Picts–fairies are\ncalled “Pechs” in Scotland–and other early races, but with these\nethnological equations we need not much concern ourselves. It is\notherwise with the mound-traditions and their relation, if not to\nfairy tales in general, to tales about fairies, trolls, elves,\netc. These are very few in number, and generally bear the character of\nanecdotes. The fairies, etc., steal a child, they help a wanderer to a\ndrink and then disappear into a green hill, they help cottagers with\ntheir work at night but disappear if their presence is noticed; human\nmidwives are asked to help fairy mothers, fairy maidens marry ordinary\nmen or girls marry and live with fairy husbands. All such things may\nhave happened and bear no such à priori marks of impossibility\nas speaking animals, flying through the air, and similar incidents of\nthe folk-tale pure and simple. If, as archaeologists tell us, there\nwas once a race of men in Northern Europe, very short and hairy, that\ndwelt in underground chambers artificially concealed by green\nhillocks, it does not seem unlikely that odd survivors of the race\nshould have lived on after they had been conquered and nearly\nexterminated by Aryan invaders and should occasionally have performed\nsomething like the pranks told of fairies and trolls.",
        "Certainly the description of the Dark Tower of the King of Elfland in\n“Childe Rowland,” has a remarkable resemblance to the dwellings of the\n“good folk,” which recent excavations have revealed. By the kindness\nof Mr. MacRitchie, I am enabled to give the reader illustrations of\none of the most interesting of these, the Maes-How of Orkney. This is\na green mound some 100 feet in length and 35 in breadth at its\nbroadest part. Tradition had long located a goblin in its centre, but\nit was not till 1861 that it was discovered to be pierced by a long\npassage 53 feet in length, and only two feet four inches high, for\nhalf of its length. This led into a central chamber 15 feet square and\nopen to the sky.",
        "Now it is remarkable how accurately all this corresponds to the Dark\nTower of “Childe Rowland,” allowing for a little idealisation on the\npart of the narrator. We have the long dark passage leading into the\nwell-lit central chamber, and all enclosed in a green hill or mound.\nIt is of course curious to contrast Mr. Batten’s frontispiece with the\ncentral chamber of the How, but the essential features are the same.\nEven such a minute touch as the terraces on the hill have their\nbearing, I believe, on Mr. MacRitchie’s “realistic” views of Faerie.\nFor in quite another connection Mr. G. L. Gomme, in his recent\n“Village Community” (W. Scott), pp. 75-98, has given reasons and\nexamples for believing that terrace cultivation along the sides of\nhills was a practice of the non-Aryan and pre-Aryan inhabitants of\nthese isles. [Footnote: To these may be added Iona (cf. Duke of\nArgyll, Iona, p. 109).] Here then from a quarter quite unexpected\nby Mr. MacRitchie, we have evidence of the association of the King\nof Elfland with a non-Aryan mode of cultivation of the soil. By Mr.\nGomme’s kindness I am enabled to give an illustration of this.",
        "Altogether it seems not improbable that in such a tale as “Childe\nRowland” we have an idealised picture of a “marriage by capture” of\none of the diminutive non-Aryan dwellers of the green hills with an\nAryan maiden, and her re-capture by her brothers. It is otherwise\ndifficult to account for such a circumstantial description of the\ninterior of these mounds, and especially of such a detail as the\nterrace cultivation on them. At the same time it must not be thought\nthat Mr. MacRitchie’s views explain all fairy tales, or that his\nidentifications of Finns = Fenians = Fairies = Sidhe = “Pechs” = Picts,\nwill necessarily be accepted. His interesting book, so far as it goes,\nseems to throw light on tales about mermaids (Finnish women in their\n“kayaks,”) and trolls, but not necessarily, on fairy tales in general.\nThus, in the present volume, besides “Childe Rowland,” there is only\n“Tom Tit Tot” in his hollow, the green hill in “Kate Crackernuts,” the\n“Cauld Lad of Hilton,” and perhaps the “Fairy Ointment,” that are\naffected by his views.",
        "Finally, there are a couple of words in the narrative that deserve a\ncouple of words of explanation: “Widershins” is probably, as Mr.\nBatten suggests, analogous to the German “wider Schein,” against the\nappearance of the sun, “counter-clockwise” as the mathematicians say–\ni.e., W., S., E., N., instead of with the sun and the hands of\na clock; why it should have an unspelling influence is hard to say.\n“Bogle” is a provincial word for “spectre,” and is analogous to the\nWelsh bwg, “goblin,” and to the English insect of similar name,\nand still more curiously to the Russian “Bog,” God, after which so\nmany Russian rivers are named. I may add that “Burd” is etymologically\nthe same as “bride” and is frequently used in the early romances for\n“Lady.”",
        "Source.–Folk-Lore Journal, ii. p. 68, forwarded by Rev.\nWalter Gregor. I have modified the dialect and changed “Mally” into\n“Molly.”",
        "Parallels.–The first part is clearly the theme of “Hop o’ my\nThumb,” which Mr. Lang has studied in his “Perrault,” pp. civ.-cxi.\n(cf. Köhler, Occident, ii. 301.) The change of night-dresses\noccurs in Greek myths. The latter part wanders off into “rob giant of\nthree things,” a familiar incident in folk-tales (Cosquin, i. 46-7), and\nfinally winds up with the “out of sack” trick, for which see Cosquin, i.\n113; ii. 209; and Köhler on Campbell, in Occident and Orient,\nii. 489-506.",
        "Source.–\"The Red Etin” in Chambers’s Pop. Rhymes of\nScotland, p. 89. I have reduced the adventurers from three to two,\nand cut down the herds and their answers. I have substituted riddles\nfrom the first English collection of riddles, The Demandes\nJoyous of Wynkyn de Worde, for the poor ones of the original,\nwhich are besides not solved. “Ettin” is the English spelling of the\nword, as it is thus spelt in a passage of Beaumont and Fletcher\n(Knight of Burning Pestle, i. 1), which may refer to this very\nstory, which, as we shall see, is quite as old as their time.",
        "Parallels.–\"The Red Etin” is referred to in The Complaynt\nof Scotland, about 1548. It has some resemblance to “Childe\nRowland,” which see. The “death index,” as we may call tokens that\ntell the state of health of a parted partner, is a usual incident in\nthe theme of the Two Brothers, and has been studied by the Grimms, i.\n421, 453; ii. 403; by Köhler on Campbell, Occ. u. Or., ii. 119-\n20; on Gonzenbach, ii. 230; on Bladé, 248; by Cosquin, l.c., i.\n70-2, 193; by Crane, Ital. Pop. Tales, 326; and by Jones and\nKropf, Magyar Tales, 329. Riddles generally come in the form of\nthe “riddle-bride-wager” (cf. Child, Ballads, i. 415-9;\nii. 519), when the hero or heroine wins a spouse by guessing a riddle\nor riddles. Here it is the simpler Sphinx form of the “riddle task,\"\non which see Köhler in Jahrb. rom. Phil., vii. 273, and on\nGonzenbach, 215.",

        "Remarks.–It is doubtful how far such gruesome topics should be\nintroduced into a book for children, but as a matter of fact the\nkatharsis of pity and terror among the little ones is as\neffective as among the spectators of a drama, and they take the same\nkind of pleasant thrill from such stories. They know it is all make-\nbelieve just as much as the spectators of a tragedy. Every one who has\nenjoyed the blessing of a romantic imagination has been trained up on\nsuch tales of wonder.",

        "Parallels.–Halliwell, p. 166, gives a similar tale of “An\nOxford Student,” whose sweetheart saw him digging her grave. “Mr. Fox\"\nis clearly a variant of the theme of “The Robber Bridegroom” (Grimm,\nNo. 40, Mrs. Hunt’s translation, i. 389, 395; and Cosquin, i. 180-1).",

He not alone punished bad boys,\nas here, but also rewarded the good, by leaving them gifts on\nappropriate occasions like Santa Claus or Father Christmas, who, as is\nwell known, only leave things for good children.

If there is\nany mistake in the order of neatness in the various birds’ nests, I\nmust have learnt my lesson badly.",
        "Remarks.–English popular tradition is curiously at variance\nabout the magpie’s nidificatory powers, for another legend given by\nMr. Swainson represents her as refusing to be instructed by the birds\nand that is why she does not make a good nest.",
