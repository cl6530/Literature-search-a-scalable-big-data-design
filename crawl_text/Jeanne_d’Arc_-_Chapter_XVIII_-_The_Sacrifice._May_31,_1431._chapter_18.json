        "\nSt. Joan of Arc\nIn French Jeanne d’Arc;\nCommonly known as la Pucelle (the Maid) by her contemporaries.\n\n",
        "\n\n",
        "It is not necessary to be a good man in order to divine what in\ncertain circumstances a good and pure spirit will do. The Bishop of\nBeauvais had entertained no doubt as to what would happen. He knew\nexactly, with a perspicuity creditable to his perceptions at least,\nthat, notwithstanding the effect which his theatrical mise en scène\nhad produced upon the imagination of Jeanne, no power in heaven or\nearth would induce that young soul to content itself with a lie. He\nknew it, though lies were his daily bread; the children of this world\nare wiser in their generation than the children of light. He had\nbidden his English patrons to wait a little, and now his predictions\nwere triumphantly fulfilled. It is hard to believe of any man that on\nsuch a certainty he could have calculated and laid his devilish plans;\nbut there would seem to have existed in the mediæval churchman a\ncertain horrible thirst for the blood of a relapsed heretic which was\npeculiar to their age and profession, and which no better principle in\ntheir own minds could subdue. It was their appetite, their delight of\nsensation, in distinction from the other appetites perhaps scarcely\nless cruel which other men indulged with no such horrified\ndenunciation from the rest of the world. Others, it is evident, shared\nwith Cauchon that sharp sensation of dreadful pleasure in finding her\nout; young Courcelles, so modest and unassuming and so learned, among\nthe rest; not L’Oyseleur, it appears by the sequel. That Judas, like\nthe greater traitor, was struck to the heart; but the less bad man who\nhad only persecuted, not betrayed, stood high in superior virtue, and\nonly rejoiced that at last the victim was ready to drop into the\nflames which had been so carefully prepared.",
        "The next morning, Tuesday after Trinity Sunday, the witnesses hurried\nwith their news to the quickly summoned assembly in the chapel of the\nArchbishop’s house; thirty-three of the judges, having been hastily\ncalled together, were there to hear. Jeanne had relapsed; the sinner\nescaped had been re-caught; and what was now to be done? One by one\neach man rose again and gave his verdict. Once more Egidius, Abbot of\nFécamp, led the tide of opinion. There was but one thing to be done:\nto give her up to the secular justice, “praying that she might be\ngently dealt with.” Man after man added his voice “to that of Abbot of\nFécamp aforesaid\"–that she might be gently dealt with! Not one of\nthem could be under any doubt what gentle meaning would be in the\nexecution; but apparently the words were of some strange use in\nsalving their consciences.",
        "The decree was pronounced at once without further formalities. In\npoint of view of the law, there should have followed another trial,\nmore evidence, pleadings, and admonitions. We may be thankful to\nMonseigneur de Beauvais that he now defied law, and no longer\nprolonged the useless ceremonials of that mockery of justice. It is\nsaid that in coming out of the prison, through the courtyard full of\nEnglishmen, where Warwick was in waiting to hear what news, the Bishop\ngreeted them with all the satisfaction of success, laughing and\nbidding them “Make good cheer, the thing is done.” In the same spirit\nof satisfaction was the rapid action of the further proceedings. On\nTuesday she was condemned, summoned on Wednesday morning at eight\n’clock to the Old Market of Rouen to hear her sentence, and there,\nwithout even that formality, the penalty was at once carried out. No\ntime, certainly, was lost in this last stage.",
        "All the interest of the heart-rending tragedy now turns to the prison\nwhere Jeanne woke in the early morning without, as yet, any knowledge\nof her fate. It must be remembered that the details of this wonderful\nscene, which we have in abundance, are taken from reports made twenty\nyears after by eye-witnesses indeed, but men to whom by that time it\nhad become the only policy to represent Jeanne in the brightest\ncolours, and themselves as her sympathetic friends. There is no doubt\nthat so remarkable an occurrence as her martyrdom must have made a\ndeep impression on the minds of all those who were in any way actors\nin or spectators of that wonderful scene. And every word of all these\ndifferent reports is on oath; but notwithstanding, a touch of\nunconscious colour, a more favourable sentiment, influenced by the\nfeeling of later days, may well have crept in. With this warning we\nmay yet accept these depositions as trustworthy, all the more for the\natmosphere of truth, perfectly realistic, and in no way idealised,\nwhich is in every description of the great catastrophe; in which\nJeanne figures as no supernatural heroine, but as a terrified,\ntormented, and often trembling girl.",
        "On the fatal morning very early, Brother Martin l’Advenu appeared in\nthe cell of the Maid. He had a mingled tale to tell–first “to\nannounce to her her approaching death, and to lead her to true\ncontrition and penitence; and also to hear her confession, which the\nsaid l’Advenu did very carefully and charitably.” Jeanne on her part\nreceived the news with no conventional resignation or calm. Was it\npossible that she had been deceived and really hoped for mercy? She\nbegan to weep and to cry at the sudden stroke of fate. Notwithstanding\nthe solemnity of her last declaration, that she would rather bear her\npunishment all at once than to endure the long punishment of her\nprison, her heart failed before the imminent stake, the immediate\nmartyrdom. She cried out to heaven and earth: “My body, which has\nnever been corrupted, must it be burned to ashes to-day!” No one but\nJeanne knew at what cost she had kept her perfect purity; was it good\nfor nothing but to be burned, that young body not nineteen years old?\n“Ah,” she said, “I would rather be beheaded seven times than burned! I\nappeal to God against all these great wrongs they do me.” But after a\nwhile the passion wore itself out, the child’s outburst was stilled;\ncalming herself, she knelt down and made her confession to the\ncompassionate friar, then asked for the sacrament, to “receive her\nSaviour” as she had so often prayed and entreated before. It would\nappear that this had not been within Friar Martin’s commission. He\nsent to ask the Bishop’s leave, and it was granted “anything she asked\nfor\"–as they give whatever he may wish to eat to a condemned convict.\nBut the Host was brought into the prison without ceremony, without\naccompanying candles or vestment for the priest. There are always some\nthings which are insupportable to a man. Brother Martin could bear the\nsight of the girl’s anguish, but not to administer to her a diminished\nrite. He sent again to demand what was needful, out of respect for the\nHoly Sacrament and the present victim. And his request had come, it\nwould seem, to some canon or person in authority whose heart had been\ntouched by the wonderful Maid in her long martyrdom. This nameless\nsympathiser did all that a man could do. He sent the Host with a train\nof priests chanting litanies as they went through the streets, with\ntorches burning in the pure early daylight; some of these exhorted the\npeople who knelt as they passed, to pray for her. She must have heard\nin her prison the sound of the bell, the chant of the clergy, the\npause of awe, and then the rising, irregular murmur of the voices,\nthat sound of prayer never to be mistaken. Pray for her! At last the\ncity was touched to its heart. There is no sign that it had been\nsympathetic to Jeanne before; it was half English or more. But she was\nabout to die: she had stood bravely against the world and answered\nlike a true Maid; and they had now seen her led through their streets,\na girl just nineteen. The popular imagination at least was subjugated\nfor the time.",
        "Thus Jeanne for the first time, after all the feasts were over,\nreceived at last “her Saviour” as she said, the consecration of that\nrite which He himself had instituted before He died. But she was not\npermitted to receive it in simplicity and silence as becomes the\nsacred commemoration. All the time she was still preschée and\nadmonished by the men about her. A few days after her death the Bishop\nand his followers assembled, and set down in evidence their different\nparts in that scene. How far it is to be relied upon, it is difficult\nto say. The speakers did not testify under oath; there is no formal\nwarrant for their truth, and an anxious attempt to prove her change of\nmind is evident throughout; still there seem elements of truth in it,\nand a certain glimpse is afforded of Jeanne in the depths, when hope\nand strength were gone. The general burden of their testimony is that\nshe sadly allowed herself to have been deceived, as to the liberation\nfor which all along she had hoped. Peter Morice, often already\nmentioned, importuning her on the subject of the spirits, endeavouring\nto get from her an admission that she had not seen them at all, and\nwas herself a deceiver: or if not that, at least that they were evil\nspirits, not good,–drew from her the impatient exclamation: “Be they\ngood spirits, or be they evil, they appeared to me.” Even in the act\nof giving her her last communion, Brother Martin paused with the\nconsecrated Host in his hands.",
        "“Do you believe,” he said, “that this is the body of Christ?” Jeanne\nanswered: “Yes, and He alone can free me; I pray you to administer.\"\nThen this brother said to Jeanne: “Do you believe as fully in your\nvoices?” Jeanne answered: “I believe in God alone and not in the\nvoices, which have deceived me.” L’Advenu himself, however, does not\ngive this deposition, but another of the persons present, Le Camus,\nwho did not live to revise his testimony at the Rehabilitation.",
        "The rite being over, the Bishop himself bustled in with an air of\nsatisfaction, rubbing his hands, one may suppose from his tone. “So,\nJeanne,” he said, “you have always told us that your ’voices’ said you\nwere to be delivered, and you see now they have deceived you. Tell us\nthe truth at last.” Then Jeanne answered: “Truly I see that they have\ndeceived me.” The report is Cauchon’s, and therefore little to be\ntrusted; but the sad reply is at least not unlike the sentiment that,\neven in records more trustworthy, seems to have breathed forth in her.\nThe other spectators all report another portion of this conversation.\n“Bishop, it is by you I die,” are the words with which the Maid is\nsaid to have met him. “Oh Jeanne, have patience,” he replied. “It is\nbecause you did not keep your promise.” “If you had kept yours, and\nsent me to the prison of the Church, and put me in gentle hands, it\nwould not have happened,” she replied. “I appeal from you to God.\"\nSeveral of the attendants, also according to the Bishop’s account,\nheard from her the same sad words: “They have deceived me\"; and there\nseems no reason why we should not believe it. Her mind was weighed\ndown under this dreadful unaccountable fact. She was forsaken–as a\ngreater sufferer was; and a horror of darkness had closed around her.\n“Ah, Sieur Pierre,” she said to Morice, “where shall I be to-night?\"\nThe man had condemned her as a relapsed heretic, a daughter of\nperdition. He had just suggested to her that her angels must have been\ndevils. Nevertheless perhaps his face was not unkindly, he had not\nmeant all the harm he did. He ought to have answered, “In Hell, with\nthe spirits you have trusted\"; that would have been the only logical\nresponse. What he did say was very different. “Have you not good faith\nin the Lord?” said the judge who had doomed her. Amazing and notable\nspeech! They had sentenced her to be burned for blasphemy as an envoy\nof the devil; they believed in fact that she was the child of God, and\ngoing straight in that flame to the skies. Jeanne, with the sound,\nclear head and the “sane mind” to which all of them testified, did she\nperceive, even at that dreadful moment, the inconceivable\ncontradiction? “Ah,” she said, “yes, God helping me, I shall be in\nParadise.”",
        "There is one point in the equivocal report which commends itself to\nthe mind, which several of these men unite in, but which was carefully\nnot repeated at the Rehabilitation: and this was that Jeanne allowed\n“as if it had been a thing of small importance,” that her story of the\nangel bearing the crown at Chinon was a romance which she neither\nexpected nor intended to be believed. For this we have to thank\nL’Oyseleur and the rest of the reverend ghouls assembled on that\ndreadful morning in the prison.",
        "Jeanne was then dressed, for her last appearance in this world, in the\nlong white garment of penitence, the robe of sacrifice: and the mitre\nwas placed on her head which was worn by the victims of the Holy\nOffice. She was led for the last time down the echoing stair to the\ncrowded courtyard where her “chariot” awaited her. It was her\nconfessor’s part to remain by her side, and Frère Isambard and\nMassieu, the officer, both her friends, were also with her. It is said\nthat L’Oyseleur rushed forward at this moment, either to accompany her\nalso, or, as many say, to fling himself at her feet and implore her\npardon. He was hustled aside by the crowd and would have been killed\nby the English, it is said, but for Warwick. The bystanders would seem\nto have been seized with a sudden disgust for all the priests about,\nthinking them Jeanne’s friends, the historians insinuate–more likely\nin scorn and horror of their treachery. And then the melancholy\nprocession set forth.",
        "The streets were overflowing as was natural, crowded in every part:\neight hundred English soldiers surrounded and followed the cortège, as\nthe car rumbled along over the rough stones. Not yet had the Maid\nattained to the calm of consent. She looked wildly about her at all\nthe high houses and windows crowded with gazers, and at the throngs\nthat gaped and gazed upon her on every side. In the midst of the\nconsolations of the confessor who poured pious words in her ears,\nother words, the plaints of a wondering despair fell from her lips,\n“Rouen! Rouen!” she said; “am I to die here?” It seemed incredible to\nher, impossible. She looked about still for some sign of disturbance,\nsome rising among the crowd, some cry of “France! France!” or glitter\nof mail. Nothing: but the crowds ever gazing, murmuring at her, the\nsoldiers roughly clearing the way, the rude chariot rumbling on.\n“Rouen, Rouen! I fear that you shall yet suffer because of this,” she\nmurmured in her distraction, amid her moanings and tears.",
        "At last the procession came to the Old Market, an open space\nencumbered with three erections–one reaching up so high that the\nshadow of it seemed to touch the sky, the horrid stake with wood piled\nup in an enormous mass, made so high, it is said, in order that the\nexecutioner himself might not reach it to give a merciful blow, to\nsecure unconsciousness before the flames could touch the trembling\nform. Two platforms were raised opposite, one furnished with chairs\nand benches for Winchester and his court, another for the judges, with\nthe civil officers of Rouen who ought to have pronounced sentence in\ntheir turn. Without this form the execution was illegal: what did it\nmatter? No sentence at all was read to her, not even the\necclesiastical one which was illegal also. She was probably placed\nfirst on the same platform with her judges, where there was a pulpit\nfrom which she was to be preschée for the last time. Of all Jeanne’s\nsufferings this could scarcely be the least, that she was always\npreschée, lectured, addressed, sermonised through every painful step\nof her career.",
        "The moan was still unsilenced on her lips, and her distracted soul\nscarcely yet freed from the sick thought of a possible deliverance,\nwhen the everlasting strain of admonishment, and re-enumeration of her\nerrors, again penetrated the hum of the crowd. The preacher was\nNicolas Midi, one of the eloquent members of that dark fraternity; and\nhis text was in St. Paul’s words: “If any of the members suffer, all\nthe other members suffer with it.” Jeanne was a rotten branch which\nhad to be cut off from the Church for the good of her own soul, and\nthat the Church might not suffer by her sin; a heretic, a blasphemer,\nan impostor, giving forth false fables at one time, and making a false\npenitence the next. It is very unlikely that she heard anything of\nthat flood of invective. At the end of the sermon the preacher bade\nher “Go in peace.” Even then, however, the fountain of abuse did not\ncease. The Bishop himself rose, and once more by way of exhorting her\nto a final repentance, heaped ill names upon her helpless head. The\nnarrative shows that the prisoner, now arrived at the last point in\nher career, paid no attention to the tirade levelled at her from the\npresident’s place. “She knelt down on the platform showing great signs\nand appearance of contrition, so that all those who looked upon her\nwept. She called on her knees upon the blessed Trinity, the blessed\nglorious Virgin Mary, and all the blessed saints of Paradise.” She\ncalled specially–was it with still a return towards the hoped for\nmiracle? was it with the instinctive cry towards an old and faithful\nfriend?–\"St. Michael, St. Michael, St. Michael, help!” There would\nseem to have been a moment in which the hush and silence of a great\ncrowd surrounded this wonderful stage, where was that white figure on\nher knees, praying, speaking–sometimes to God, sometimes to the\nsaintly unseen companions of her life, sometimes in broken phrases to\nthose about her. She asked the priests, thronging all round, those who\nhad churches, to say a mass for her soul. She asked all whom she might\nhave offended to forgive her. Through her tears and prayers broke\nagain and again the sorrowful cry of “Rouen, Rouen! Is it here truly\nthat I must die?” No reason is given for the special pang that seems\nto echo in this cry. Jeanne had once planned a campaign in Normandy\nwith Alençon. Had there been perhaps some special hope which made this\nconclusion all the more bitter, of setting up in the Norman capital\nher standard and that of her King?",
        "There have been martyrs more exalted above the circumstances of their\nfate than Jeanne. She was no abstract heroine. She felt every pang to\nthe depth of her natural, spontaneous being, and the humiliation and\nthe deep distress of having been abandoned in the sight of men,\nperhaps the profoundest pang of which nature is capable. “He trusted\nin God that he would deliver him: let him deliver him if he will have\nhim.” That which her Lord had borne, the little sister had now to\nbear. She called upon the saints, but they did not answer. She was\nshamed in the sight of men. But as she knelt there weeping, the\nBishop’s evil voice scarcely silenced, the soldiers waiting impatient\n–the entire crowd, touched to its heart with one impulse, broke into\na burst of weeping and lamentation, “à chaudes larmes” according to\nthe graphic French expression. They wept hot tears as in the keen\npersonal pang of sorrow and fellow-feeling and impotence to help.\nWinchester–withdrawn high on his platform, ostentatiously separated\nfrom any share in it, a spectator merely–wept; and the judges wept.\nThe Bishop of Boulogne was overwhelmed with emotion, iron tears flowed\ndown the accursed Cauchon’s cheeks. The very world stood still to see\nthat white form of purity, and valour, and faith, the Maid, not\nshouting triumphant on the height of victory, but kneeling, weeping,\non the verge of torture. Human nature could not bear this long. A\nhoarse cry burst forth: “Will you keep us here all day; must we dine\nhere?” a voice perhaps of unendurable pain that simulated cruelty. And\nthen the executioner stepped in and seized the victim.",
        "It has been said that her stake was set so high, that there might be\nno chance of a merciful blow, or of strangulation to spare the victim\nthe atrocities of the fire; perhaps, let us hope, it was rather that\nthe ascending smoke might suffocate her before the flame could reach\nher: the fifteenth century would naturally accept the most cruel\nexplanation. There was a writing set over the little platform which\ngave footing to the attendants below the stake, upon which were\nwritten the following words:",
        "  JEANNE CALLED THE MAID, LIAR, ABUSER OF THE PEOPLE, SOOTHSAYER,\n  BLASPHEMER OF GOD, PERNICIOUS, SUPERSTITIOUS, IDOLATROUS, CRUEL,\n  DISSOLUTE, INVOKER OF DEVILS, APOSTATE, SCHISMATIC, HERETIC.",
        "This was how her countrymen in the name of law and justice and\nreligion branded the Maid of France–one half of her countrymen: the\nother half, silent, speaking no word, looking on.",
        "Before she began to ascend the stake, Jeanne, rising from her knees,\nasked for a cross. No place so fit for that emblem ever was: but no\ncross was to be found. One of the English soldiers who kept the way\nseized a stick from some one by, broke it across his knee in unequal\nparts, and bound them hurriedly together; so, in the legend and in all\nthe pictures, when Mary of Nazareth was led to her espousals, one of\nher disappointed suitors broke his wand. The cross was rough with its\nbroken edges which Jeanne accepted from her enemy, and carried,\npressing it against her bosom. One would rather have that rude cross\nto preserve as a sacred thing, than the highest effort of art in gold\nand silver. This was her ornament and consolation as she trod the few\nremaining steps and mounted the pile of the faggots to her place high\nover all that sea of heads. When she was bound securely to her stake,\nshe asked again for a cross, a cross blessed and sacred from a church,\nto be held before her as long as her eyes could see. Frère Isambard\nand Massieu, following her closely still, sent to the nearest church,\nand procured probably some cross which was used for processional\npurposes on a long staff which could be held up before her. The friar\nstood upon the faggots holding it up, and calling out broken words of\nencouragement so long that Jeanne bade him withdraw, lest the fire\nshould catch his robes. And so at last, as the flames began to rise,\nshe was left alone, the good brother always at the foot of the pile,\npainfully holding up with uplifted arms the cross that she might still\nsee it, the soldiers crowding, lit up with the red glow of the fire,\nthe horrified, trembling crowd like an agitated sea around. The wild\nflames rose and fell in sinister gleams and flashes, the smoke blew\nupwards, by times enveloping that white Maid standing out alone\nagainst a sky still blue and sweet with May–Pandemonium underneath,\nbut Heaven above. Then suddenly there came a great cry from among the\nblack fumes that began to reach the clouds: “My voices were of God!\nThey have not deceived me!” She had seen and recognised it at last.\nHere it was, the miracle: the great victory that had been promised–\nthough not with clang of swords and triumph of rescuing knights, and\n“St. Denis for France!\"–but by the sole hand of God, a victory and\ntriumph for all time, for her country a crown of glory and ineffable\nshame.",
        "Thus died the Maid of France–with “Jesus, Jesus,” on her lips–till\nthe merciful smoke breathing upwards choked that voice in her throat;\nand one who was like unto the Son of God, who was with her in the\nfire, wiped all memory of the bitter cross, wavering uplifted through\nthe air in the good monk’s trembling hands–from eyes which opened\nbright upon the light and peace of that Paradise of which she had so\nlong thought and dreamed.",
