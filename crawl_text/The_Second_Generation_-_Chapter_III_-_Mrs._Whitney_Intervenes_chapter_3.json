        "As Hiram had always been silent and seemingly abstracted, no one but\nEllen noted the radical change in him. She had brought up her children in\nthe old-fashioned way–her thoughts, and usually her eyes, upon them all\nday, and one ear open all night. When she no longer had them to guard,\nshe turned all this energy of solicitude to her husband; thus the\npassionate love of her youth was having a healthy, beautiful old age. The\nyears of circumventing the easily roused restiveness of her spirited boy\nand girl had taught her craft; without seeming to be watching Hiram, no\ndetail of his appearance or actions escaped her.",
        "“There’s mighty little your pa don’t see,” had been one of her stock\nobservations to the children from their earliest days. “And you needn’t\nflatter yourselves he don’t care because he don’t speak.” Now she noted\nthat from under his heavy brows his eyes were looking stealthily out,\nmore minutely observant than ever before, and that what he saw either\nadded to his sadness or took a color of sadness from his mood. She\nguessed that the actions of Adelaide and Arthur, so utterly different\nfrom the actions of the children of her and Hiram’s young days–except\nthose regarded by all worth-while people as “trifling and trashy\"–had\nsomething to do with Hiram’s gloom. She decided that Arthur’s failure and\nhis lightness of manner in face of it were the chief trouble–this until\nHiram’s shoulders began to stoop and hollows to appear in his cheeks and\nunder his ears, and a waxlike pallor to overspread his face. Then she\nknew that he was not well physically; and, being a practical woman, she\ndismissed the mental causes of the change. “People talk a lot about their\nmental troubles,” she said to herself, “but it’s usually three-fourths\nstomach and liver.”",
        "As Hiram and illness, real illness, could not be associated in her mind,\nshe gave the matter no importance until she heard him sigh heavily one\nnight, after they had been in bed several hours. “What is it, father?\"\nshe asked.",
        "There was no answer, but a return to an imitation of the regular\nbreathing of a sleeper.",
        "“Hiram,” she insisted, “what is it?”",
        "“Nothing, Ellen, nothing,” he answered; “I must have ate something that\ndon’t sit quite right.”",
        "“You didn’t take no supper at all,” said she.",
        "This reminded him how useless it was to try to deceive her. “I ain’t been\nfeeling well of late,” he confessed, “but it’ll soon be over.” He did not\nsee the double meaning of his words until he had uttered them; he stirred\nuneasily in his dread that she would suspect. “I went to the doctor.”",
        "“What did he say?–though I don’t know why I should ask what such a fool\nas Milbury said about anything.”",
        "“I got some medicine,” replied he, evading telling her what doctor.",
        "Instantly she sat up in bed. “I haven’t seen you take no drugs!” she\nexclaimed. Drugs were her especial abhorrence. She let no one in the\nfamily take any until she had passed upon them.",
        "“I didn’t want to make a fuss,” he explained.",
        "“Where is it?” she demanded, on the edge of the bed now, ready to rise.",
        "“I’ll show it to you in the morning, mother. Lie down and go to sleep.\nI’ve been awake long enough.”",
        "“Where is it?” she repeated, and he heard her moving across the room\ntoward the gas fixture.",
        "“In my vest pocket. It’s a box of pills. You can’t tell nothin’\nabout it.”",
        "She lit the gas and went to his waistcoat, hanging where it always hung\nat night–on a hook beside the closet door. He watched her fumble\nthrough the pockets, watched her take her spectacles from the corner of\nthe mantel and put them on, the bridge well down toward the end of her\nnose. A not at all romantic figure she made, standing beside the\nsputtering gas jet, her spectacles balanced on her nose, her thin neck\nand forearms exposed, and her old face studying the lid of the pill box\nheld in her toil- and age-worn hands. The box dropped from her fingers\nand rolled along the floor. He saw an awful look slowly creep over her\nfeatures as the terrible thought crept over her mind. As she began to\nturn her face toward him, with a motion of the head like that of a\nmachine on unoiled bearings, he closed his eyes; but he felt her\nlooking at him.",
        "“Dr. Schulze!” she said, an almost soundless breathing of the name that\nalways meant the last resort in mortal illness.",
        "He was trying to think of lies to tell her, but he could think of\nnothing. The sense of light upon his eyelids ceased. He presently felt\nher slowly getting into bed. A pall-like silence; then upon his cheek, in\nlong discontinued caress, a hand whose touch was as light and soft as the\nfall of a rose leaf–the hand of love that toil and age cannot make\nharsh, and her fingers were wet with her tears. Thus they lay in the\ndarkness and silence, facing together the tragedy of the eternal\nseparation.",
        "“What did he say, dearest?” she asked. She had not used that word to him\nsince the first baby came and they began to call each other “father” and\n“mother.” All these years the children had been between them, and each\nhad held the other important chiefly as related to them. Now it was as\nin their youth–just he and she, so close that only death could come\nbetween them.",
        "“It’s a long way off,” said Hiram. He would not set ringing in her ears\nthat knell which was clanging to him its solemn, incessant, menacing “Put\nyour house in order!”",
        "“Tell me what he said,” she urged gently.",
        "“He couldn’t make out exactly. The medicine’ll patch me up.”",
        "She did not insist–why fret him to confess what she knew the instant\nshe read “Schulze” on the box? After an hour she heard him breathing as\nonly a sleeper can breathe; but she watched on until morning. When they\nwere dressing, each looked at the other furtively from time to time, a\ngreat tenderness in his eyes, and in hers the anguish of a dread that\nmight not be spoken.",
        "On the day after Mrs. Whitney’s arrival for the summer, she descended in\nstate from the hills to call upon the Rangers.",
        "When the front bell rang Mrs. Ranger was in the kitchen–and was dressed\nfor the kitchen. As the “girl” still had not been replaced she answered\nthe door herself. In a gingham wrapper, with her glasses thrust up into\nher gray hair, she was facing a footman in livery.",
        "“Are Mrs. Ranger and Miss Ranger at home?” asked he, mistaking her for\na servant and eying her dishevelment with an expression which was not\nlost on her.",
        "She smiled with heartiest good nature. “Yes, I’m here–I’m Mrs.\nRanger,” said she; and she looked beyond him to the victoria in which\nsat Mrs. Whitney. “How d’ye do, Matilda?” she called. “Come right in.\nAs usual when the canneries are running, I’m my own upstairs girl. I\nreckon your young man here thinks I ought to discharge her and get one\nthat’s tidier.”",
        "“Your young man here” was stiffly touching the brim of his top hat and\nsaying: “Beg parding, ma’am.”",
        "“Oh, that’s all right,” replied Mrs. Ranger; “I am what I look to be!”",
        "Behind her now appeared Adelaide, her cheeks burning in mortification she\nwas ashamed of feeling and still more ashamed of being unable to conceal.\n“Go and put on something else, mother,” she urged in an undertone; “I’ll\nlook after Mrs. Whitney till you come down.”",
        "“Ain’t got time,” replied her mother, conscious of what was in her\ndaughter’s mind and a little contemptuous and a little resentful of it.\n“I guess Tilly Whitney will understand. If she don’t, why, I guess we can\nbear up under it.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney had left her carriage and was advancing up the steps. She\nwas a year older than Ellen Ranger; but so skillfully was she got\ntogether that, had she confessed to forty or even thirty-eight, one who\ndidn’t know would have accepted her statement as too cautious by hardly\nmore than a year or so. The indisputably artificial detail in her\nelegant appearance was her hair; its tinting, which had to be made\nstronger year by year as the gray grew more resolute, was reaching the\nstage of hard, rough-looking red. “Another year or two,” thought\nAdelaide, “and it’ll make her face older than she really is. Even now\nshe’s getting a tough look.”",
        "Matilda kissed Mrs. Ranger and Adelaide affectedly on both cheeks. “I’m\nso glad to find you in!” said she. “And you, poor dear\"–this to Mrs.\nRanger–\"are in agony over the servant question.” She glanced behind her\nto make sure the carriage had driven away. “I don’t know what we’re\ncoming to. I can’t keep a man longer than six months. Servants don’t\nappreciate a good home and good wages. As soon as a man makes\nacquaintances here he becomes independent and leaves. If something isn’t\ndone, the better class of people will have to move out of the country.”",
        "“Or go back to doing their own work,” said Mrs. Ranger.",
        "Mrs. Whitney smiled vaguely–a smile which said, “I’m too polite to\nanswer that remark as it deserves.”",
        "“Why didn’t you bring Jenny along?” inquired Mrs. Ranger, when they were\nin the “front parlor,” the two older women seated, Adelaide moving\nrestlessly about.",
        "“Janet and Ross haven’t come yet,” answered Mrs. Whitney. “They’ll be on\nnext week, but only for a little while. They both like it better in the\nEast. All their friends are there and there’s so much more to do.” Mrs.\nWhitney sighed; before her rose the fascination of all there was to “do\"\nin the East–the pleasures she was denying herself.",
        "“I don’t see why you don’t live in New York,” said Mrs. Ranger. “You’re\nalways talking about it.”",
        "“Oh, I can’t leave Charles!” was Mrs. Whitney’s answer. “Or, rather\nhe’d not hear of my doing it. But I think he’ll let us take an\napartment at Sherry’s next winter–for the season, just–unless Janet\nand I go abroad.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger had not been listening. She now started up. “If you’ll excuse\nme, Mattie, I must see what that cook’s about. I’m afraid to let her out\nof my sight for five minutes for fear she’ll up and leave.”",
        "“What a time your poor mother has!” said Mrs. Whitney, when she and\nAdelaide were alone.",
        "Del had recovered from her attack of what she had been denouncing to\nherself as snobbishness. For all the gingham wrapper and spectacles\nanchored in the hair and general air of hard work and no “culture,” she\nwas thinking, as she looked at Mrs. Whitney’s artificiality and listened\nto those affected accents, that she was glad her mother was Ellen Ranger\nand not Matilda Whitney. “But mother doesn’t believe she has a hard\ntime,” she answered, “and everything depends on what one believes\noneself; don’t you think so? I often envy her. She’s always busy and\ninterested. And she’s so useful, such a happiness-maker.”",
        "“I often feel that way, too,” responded Mrs. Whitney, in her most\nprofusely ornate ’grande dame” manner. “I get so bored with leading\nan artificial life. I often wish fate had been more kind to me. I was\nreading, the other day, that the Queen of England said she had the tastes\nof a dairy maid. Wasn’t that charming? Many of us whom fate has condemned\nto the routine of high station feel the same way.”",
        "It was by such deliverances that Mrs. Whitney posed, not without success,\nas an intellectual woman who despised the frivolities of a fashionable\nexistence–this in face of the obvious fact that she led a fashionable\nexistence, or, rather, it led her, from the moment her masseuseawakened her in the morning until her maid undressed her at night. But,\nalthough Adelaide was far too young, too inexperienced to know that\njudgment must always be formed from actions, never from words, she was\nnot, in this instance, deceived. “It takes more courage than most of us\nhave,” said she, “to do what we’d like instead of what vanity suggests.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney did not understand this beyond getting from it a vague sense\nthat she had somehow been thrust at. “You must be careful of that skin of\nyours, Adele,” she thrust back. “I’ve been looking at it. You can’t have\nbeen home long, yet the exposure to the sun is beginning to show. You\nhave one of those difficult, thin skins, and one’s skin is more than half\none’s beauty. You ought never to go out without a veil. The last thing\nRoss said to me was, ’Do tell Adelaide to keep her color down.’ You know\nhe admires the patrician style.”",
        "Adelaide could not conceal the effect of the shot. Her skin was a great\ntrial to her, it burned so easily; and she hated wrapping herself in\nunder broad brims and thick veils when the feeling of bareheadedness was\nso delightful. “At any rate,” said she sweetly, “it’s easier to keep\ncolor down than to keep it up.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney pretended not to hear. She was now at the window which gave\non the garden by way of a small balcony. “There’s your father!” she\nexclaimed; “let’s go to him.”",
        "There, indeed, was Hiram, pacing the walk along the end of the garden\nwith a ponderousness in the movements of his big form that bespoke age\nand effort. It irritated Mrs. Whitney to look at him, as it had irritated\nher to look at Ellen; very painful were the reminders of the ravages of\ntime from these people of about her own age, these whom she as a child\nhad known as children. Crow’s-feet and breaking contour and thin hair in\nthose we have known only as grown people, do not affect us; but the same\nsigns in lifelong acquaintances make it impossible to ignore Decay\nholding up the mirror to us and pointing to aging mouth and throat, as he\nwags his hideous head and says, “Soon–you, too!”",
        "Hiram saw Matilda and his daughter the instant they appeared on the\nbalcony, but he gave no hint of it until they were in the path of his\nmonotonous march. He was nerving himself for Mrs. Whitney as one nerves\nhimself in a dentist’s chair for the descent of the grinder upon a\nsensitive tooth. Usually she got no further than her first sentence\nbefore irritating him. To-day the very sight of her filled him with\nseemingly causeless anger. There was a time when he, watching Matilda\nimprove away from her beginnings as the ignorant and awkward daughter of\nthe keeper of a small hotel, had approved of her and had wished that\nEllen would give more time to the matter of looks. But latterly he had\ncome to the conclusion that a woman has to choose between improving her\nexterior and improving her interior, and that it is impossible or all but\nimpossible for her to do both; he therefore found in Ellen’s very\nindifference to exteriors another reason why she seemed to him so\nsplendidly the opposite of Charles’s wife.",
        "“You certainly look the same as ever, Hiram,” Matilda said, advancing\nwith extended, beautifully gloved hand. The expression of his eyes as he\nturned them upon her gave her a shock, but she forced the smile back into\nher face and went on, “Ross says you always make him think of a tower on\ntop of a high hill, one that has always stood there and always will.”",
        "The gray shadow over Hiram’s face grew grayer. “But you ought to rest,\"\nMrs. Whitney went on. “You and Charles both ought to rest. It’s\nridiculous, the way American men act. Now, Charles has never taken a real\nvacation. When he does go away he has a secretary with him and works all\nday. But at least he gets change of scene, while you–you rarely miss a\nday at the mills.”",
        "“I haven’t missed a whole day in forty-three years,” replied Hiram,\n“except the day I got married, and I never expect to. I’ll drop in the\nharness. I’d be lost without it.”",
        "“Don’t you think that’s a narrow view of life?” asked Mrs. Whitney.\n“Don’t you think we ought all to take time to cultivate our higher\nnatures?”",
        "“What do you mean by higher natures?”",
        "Mrs. Whitney scented sarcasm and insult. To interrogate a glittering\ngenerality is to slur its projector; she wished her hearers to be\ndazzled, not moved to the impertinence of cross-examination. “I think you\nunderstand me,” she said loftily.",
        "“I don’t,” replied Hiram. “I’m only a cooper and miller. I haven’t had\nthe advantages of a higher education\"–this last with a steady look\ntoward his son, approaching from the direction of the stables. The young\nman was in a riding suit that was too correct at every point for good\ntaste, except in a college youth, and would have made upon anyone who\nhad been born, or initiated into, the real mysteries of “good form” an\nimpression similar to that of Mrs. Whitney’s costume and accent and\nmanner. There was the note of the fashion plate, the evidence of pains,\nof correctness not instinctive but studied–the marks our new-sprung\nobstreperous aristocracy has made familiar to us all. It would have\nstruck upon a sense of humor like a trivial twitter from the oboe\ntrickling through a lull in the swell of brasses and strings; but Hiram\nRanger had no sense of humor in that direction, had only his instinct\nfor the right and the wrong. The falseness, the absence of the quality\ncalled “the real thing,” made him bitter and sad. And, when his son\njoined them and walked up and down with them, he listened with heavier\ndroop of face and form to the affected chatter of the young “man of the\nworld” and the old ’grande dame” of Chicago society. They talked the\nlanguage and the affairs of a world he had never explored and had no\nwish to explore; its code and conduct, his training, his reason and his\ninstinct all joined in condemning as dishonorable shirking of a man’s\nand woman’s part in a universe so ordered that, to keep alive in it,\neveryone must either work or steal.",
        "But his boy was delighted with the conversation, with Mrs. Whitney, and,\nfinally, with himself. A long, hard ride had scattered his depression of\nmany weeks into a mere haze over the natural sunshine of youth and\nhealth; this haze now vanished. When Mrs. Whitney referred to Harvard, he\nsaid lightly, “You know I was plucked.”",
        "“Ross told me,” said she, in an amused tone; “but you’ll get back all\nright next fall.”",
        "“I don’t know that I care to go,” said Arthur. “I’ve been thinking it\nover. I believe I’ve got about all the good a university can do a man. It\nseems to me a year or so abroad–traveling about, seeing the world–would\nbe the best thing for me. I’m going to talk it over with father–as soon\nas he gets through being out of humor with me.”",
        "Hiram did not look at his son, who glanced a little uneasily at him as\nhe unfolded this new scheme for perfecting his education as “man of\nthe world.”",
        "“Surely your father’s not angry” cried Mrs. Whitney, in a tone intended\nto make Hiram ashamed of taking so narrow, so rural, a view of his son’s\nfashionable mischance.",
        "“No,” replied Hiram, and his voice sounded curt. He added, in an\nundertone: “I wish I were.”",
        "“You’re wrong there, Hiram,” said Mrs. Whitney, catching the words not\nintended for her, and misunderstanding them. “It’s not a case for\nseverity.”",
        "Arthur smiled, and the look he gave his father was a bright indication of\nthe soundness of his heart. Severity! The idea was absurd in connection\nwith the most generous and indulgent of fathers. “You don’t get his\nmeaning, Mrs. Whitney,” said he. “I, too, wish he were angry. I’m afraid\nI’ve made him sad. You know he’s got old-fashioned views of many things,\nand he can’t believe I’ve not really disgraced him and myself.”",
        "“Do you believe it?” inquired Hiram, with a look at him as sudden and\nsharp as the ray of a search light.",
        "“I know it, father,” replied Arthur earnestly. “Am I not right,\nMrs. Whitney?”",
        "“Don’t be such an old fogy, Hiram,” said Mrs. Whitney. “You ought to be\nthankful you’ve got a son like Arthur, who makes a splendid impression\neverywhere. He’s the only western man that’s got into exclusive societies\nat Harvard in years simply on his own merits, and he’s a great favorite\nin Boston and in New York.”",
        "“My children need no one to defend them to me,” said Hiram, in what might\nbe called his quiet tone–the tone he had never in his life used without\ndrying up utterly the discussion that had provoked it. Many people had\nnoted the curious effect of that tone and had resolved to defy it at the\nnext opportunity, “just to see what the consequences would be.” But when\nthe opportunity had come, their courage had always withered.",
        "“You can’t expect me to be like you, father. You wouldn’t, want it,” said\nArthur, after the pause. “I must be myself, must develop my own\nindividuality.”",
        "Ranger stopped and that stopped the others. Without looking at his son,\nhe said slowly: “I ain’t disputing that, boy. It ain’t the question.\"\nThere was tremendousness in his restrained energy and intensity as he\nwent on: “What I’m thinking about is whether I ought to keep on helpingyou to ’develop’ yourself, as you call it. That’s what won’t let me\nrest.” And he abruptly walked away.",
        "Mrs. Whitney and Arthur stared after him. “I don’t think he’s quite well,\nArtie,” she said reassuringly. “Don’t worry. He’ll come round all right.\nBut you ought to be a little more diplomatic.”",
        "Arthur was silent. Diplomacy meant deceit, and he hadn’t yet reached the\nstage of polite and comfortable compromise where deceit figures merely as\nan amiable convenience for promoting smoothness in human intercourse. But\nhe believed that his father would “come round all right,” as Mrs. Whitney\nhad so comfortingly said. How could it be otherwise when he had done\nnothing discreditable, but, on the contrary, had been developing himself\nin a way that reflected the highest credit upon his family, as it marched\nup toward the lofty goal of “cultured” ambition, toward high and secure\nsocial station.",
        "Mrs. Whitney, however, did not believe her own statement. In large part\nher reputation of being a “good, kind sort,” like many such reputations,\nrested on her habit of cheering on those who were going the wrong way and\nwere disturbed by some suspicion of the truth. She had known Hiram Ranger\nlong, had had many a trying experience of his character, gentle as a\ntrade wind–and as steady and unchangeable. Also, beneath her surface of\ndesperate striving after the things which common sense denounces, or\naffects to denounce, as foolishness, there was a shrewd, practical\nperson. “He means some kind of mischief,” she thought–an unreasoned,\ninstinctive conclusion, and, therefore, all-powerful with a woman.",
        "That evening she wrote her daughter not to cut short her visit to get to\nSaint X. “Wait until Ross is ready. Then you can join him at Chicago and\nlet him bring you.”",
        "Just about the hour she was setting down this first result of her\ninstinct’s warning against the danger signal she had seen in Hiram\nRanger’s manner, he was delivering a bombshell. He had led in the family\nprayers as usual and had just laid the Bible on the center-table in the\nback parlor after they rose from their knees. With his hands resting on\nthe cover of the huge volume he looked at his son. There was a\nsacrificial expression in his eyes. “I have decided to withdraw Arthur’s\nallowance,” he said, and his voice sounded hollow and distant, as\nunfamiliar to his own ears as to theirs. “He must earn his own living. If\nhe wants a place at the mills, there’s one waiting for him. If he’d\nrather work at something else, I’ll do what I can to get him a job.”",
        "Silence; and Hiram left the room.",
        "Adelaide was first to recover sufficiently to speak. “O mother,” cried\nshe, “you’re not going to allow this!”",
        "To Adelaide’s and Arthur’s consternation, Ellen replied quietly: “It\nain’t no use to talk to him. I ain’t lived all these years with your\nfather without finding out when he means what he says.”",
        "“It’s so unjust!” exclaimed Adelaide.",
        "There came into Ellen’s face a look she had never seen there before. It\nmade her say: “O mother, I didn’t mean that; only, it does seem hard.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger thought so, too; but she would have died rather than have\nmade the thought treason by uttering it. She followed her husband\nupstairs, saying: “You and Arthur can close up, and put out the lights.”",
        "Adelaide, almost in tears over her brother’s catastrophe, was thrilled\nwith admiration of his silent, courageous bearing. “What are you going to\ndo, Artie?”",
        "This incautious question drew his inward ferment boiling to the surface.\n“He has me down and I’ve got to take his medicine,” said the young man,\nteeth together and eyes dark with fury.",
        "This she did not admire. Her first indignation abated, as she sat on\nthere thinking it out. “Maybe father is nearer right than we know,” she\nsaid to herself finally. “After all, Arthur will merely be doing as\nfather does. There’s something wrong with him, and with me, too, or we\nshouldn’t think that so terrible.” But to Arthur she said nothing.\nEncourage him in his present mood she must not; and to try to dissuade\nhim would simply goad him on.",
