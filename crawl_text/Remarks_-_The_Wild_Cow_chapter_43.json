        "When I was young and used to roam around over the country, gathering\nwater-melons in the light of the moon, I used to think I could milk\nanybody’s cow, but I do not think so now. I do not milk a cow now unless\nthe sign is right, and it hasn’t been right for a good many years. The\nlast cow I tried to milk was a common cow, born in obscurity; kind of a\nself-made cow. I remember her brow was low, but she wore her tail high and\nshe was haughty, oh, so haughty.",
        "I made a common-place remark to her, one that is used in the very best of\nsociety, one that need not have given offence anywhere. I said “So\"–and\nshe “soed.” Then I told her to “hist” and she histed. But I thought she\noverdid it. She put too much expression in it.",
        "Just then I heard something crash through the window of the barn and fall\nwith a dull, sickening thud on the outside. The neighbors came to see what\nit was that caused the noise. They found that I had done it in getting\nthrough the window.",
        "I asked the neighbors if the barn was still standing. They said it was.\nThen I asked if the cow was injured much. They said she seemed to be quite\nrobust. Then I requested them to go in and calm the cow a little, and see\nif they could get my plug hat off her horns.",
        "I am buying all my milk now of a milkman. I select a gentle milkman who\nwill not kick, and feel as though I could trust him. Then, if he feels as\nthough he could trust me, it is all right.",
