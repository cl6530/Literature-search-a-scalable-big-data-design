        "I thank you, Wilhelm, for your cordial sympathy, for your excellent\nadvice; and I implore you to be quiet. Leave me to my sufferings.\nIn spite of my wretchedness, I have still strength enough for\nendurance. I revere religion — you know I do. I feel that it\ncan impart strength to the feeble and comfort to the afflicted,\nbut does it affect all men equally? Consider this vast universe:\nyou will see thousands for whom it has never existed, thousands\nfor whom it will never exist, whether it be preached to them, or\nnot; and must it, then, necessarily exist for me? Does not the\nSon of God himself say that they are his whom the Father has given\nto him? Have I been given to him? What if the Father will retain\nme for himself, as my heart sometimes suggests? I pray you, do\nnot misinterpret this. Do not extract derision from my harmless\nwords. I pour out my whole soul before you. Silence were otherwise\npreferable to me, but I need not shrink from a subject of which\nfew know more than I do myself. What is the destiny of man, but\nto fill up the measure of his sufferings, and to drink his allotted\ncup of bitterness? And if that same cup proved bitter to the God\nof heaven, under a human form, why should I affect a foolish pride,\nand call it sweet? Why should I be ashamed of shrinking at that\nfearful moment, when my whole being will tremble between existence\nand annihilation, when a remembrance of the past, like a flash of\nlightning, will illuminate the dark gulf of futurity, when everything\nshall dissolve around me, and the whole world vanish away? Is not\nthis the voice of a creature oppressed beyond all resource,\nself-deficient, about to plunge into inevitable destruction, and\ngroaning deeply at its inadequate strength, “My God! my God! why\nhast thou forsaken me?” And should I feel ashamed to utter the\nsame expression? Should I not shudder at a prospect which had its\nfears, even for him who folds up the heavens like a garment?",
