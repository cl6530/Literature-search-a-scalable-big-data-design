        "Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the\nshavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up\ngenerally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. His\n(Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit\nunsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom\nin view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water\navailable for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an\nexpedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman’s\nshelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge\nwhere they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda\nor a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was\nrather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to\ntake some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means\nduring which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was\nrather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to\nget a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then\ncondition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always\nassuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly after a few\nsuch preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take\nup his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in\nthe shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more\nproperly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid\natmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where\nthey made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street\nround by the corner of Dan Bergin’s. But as he confidently anticipated\nthere was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except\na fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree,\noutside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a\nquarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional\nwhistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding\nhis arms arched over his head, twice.",
        "This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently\nthere was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it\nwhich they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the\nSignal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the\ndirection of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped\nby the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to\nvary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering\nthoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the\nmischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as\nit happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the\nrecent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where\nthe empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so\nhappened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s sandstrewer happened to be\nreturning and the elder man recounted to his companion A PROPOS of the\nincident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They\npassed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the\nstarting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at\nthat late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very\nenticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at\nnight) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into\nStore street, famous for its C division police station. Between this\npoint and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen\nthought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in\nhis mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the\nother who was acting as his FIDUS ACHATES inhaled with internal\nsatisfaction the smell of James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite\nclose to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily\nbread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most\nindispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where\nis fancy bread, at Rourke’s the baker’s it is said.",
        "EN ROUTE to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet\nperfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete\npossession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober,\nspoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame\nand swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not\nas a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for\nyoung fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking\nhabits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu\nfor every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could\nadminister a nasty kick if you didn’t look out. Highly providential was\nthe appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully\nunconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour\nthe finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the\naccident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the\ncourt next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old\nWall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when\nit got bruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of\nthose policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous\nin the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or\ntwo in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole\nthrough a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet\nparts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law\nwere well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect\nthe upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers\nwith firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time\nwhich was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any\nchance they fall out over anything. You frittered away your time, he very\nsensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the\nsquandermania of the thing, fast women of the DEMIMONDE ran away with a\nlot of l.s.d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you\ngot drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he\nrelished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and\nbloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy\nwhich he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point\nwhere he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round\nto say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.\nMost of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his\npubhunting CONFRERES but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part\nof his brother medicos under all the circs.",
        "–And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing\nwhatsoever of any kind.",
        "Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back\nof the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier\nof coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted\ntheir rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no\nspecial reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the\nlight emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure\nof the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began\nto remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having\nhappened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that\nhe recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father’s, Gumley. To\navoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.",
        "–Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.",
        "A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted\nagain, calling:",
        "–Night!",
        "Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the\ncompliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as\nhe always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless\nremained on the QUI VIVE with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish\nin the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not\nby any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on\nto be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by\nplacing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city\nproper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might\nbe hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever\nboodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice, your money or\nyour life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.",
        "Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though\nhe was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s breath\nredolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him and his\ngenealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of inspector\nCorley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a certain\nKatherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather Patrick\nMichael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there\nwhose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it (though\nnot proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de\nMalahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its\nkind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman,\nas the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being\nin service in the washkitchen. This therefore was the reason why the\nstill comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen\nwas spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.",
        "Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.\nNot as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings. His friends had\nall deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to\nStephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other\nuncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to\ntell him where on God’s earth he could get something, anything at all, to\ndo. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was\nfostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through\nthe mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if\nthe whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish.\nAnyhow he was all in.",
        "–I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows\nI’m on the rocks.",
        "–There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’\nschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You may\nmention my name.",
        "–Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man. I was\nnever one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck\ntwice in the junior at the christian brothers.",
        "–I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.",
        "Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do\nwith Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart\noff the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs\nMaloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but\nM’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in\nWinetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed\nof friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he hadn’t said a\nword about it.",
        "Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still\nStephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that\nCorley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving\nof much credence. However HAUD IGNARUS MALORUM MISERIS SUCCURRERE DISCO\netcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he\ngot paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which\nwas the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the\nwherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would\nget it out of Corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a\nthing to do but hand out the needful. Whereas. He put his hand in a\npocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he\nmight lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might\nendeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in\nthe negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken\nbiscuits were all the result of his investigation. He tried his hardest\nto recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or\nleft because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much\nthe reverse in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a\nthorough search though he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimly\nremembered. Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he\nbuy. However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the\ndark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.",
        "–Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.",
        "And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him\none of them.",
        "–Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman. I’ll pay you back one\ntime. Who’s that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in\nCamden street with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good word\nfor us to get me taken on there. I’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl\nin the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks, man. God,\nyou’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don’t\ngive a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.",
        "Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six\nhe got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky\nthat he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s,\nbookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara\nand a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he was lagged\nthe night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and\nrefusing to go with the constable.",
        "Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the\ncobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation\nwatchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was\nhaving a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own\nprivate account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time\nnow and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor\nas if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was\nnot in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.\nBeing a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in\npoint of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat\nand slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic\nimpecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of\nthat it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour\nall round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter\nof that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal\nservitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis\naltogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance\nintercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick\nthat was certainly.",
        "The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his\npractised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the\nblandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said,\nlaughingly, Stephen, that is:",
        "–He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named\nBoylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.",
        "At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr\nBloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the\ndirection of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,\nmoored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,\nwhereupon he observed evasively:",
        "–Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it\nhis face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much\ndid you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?",
        "–Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep\nsomewhere.",
        "–Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the\nintelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he\ninvariably does. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to\nhis deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a\nsmile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of the\nquestion. And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred\nat Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I don’t mean\nto presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you\nleave your father’s house?",
        "–To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.",
        "–I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom\ndiplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on\nyesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of\nconversation that he had moved.",
        "–I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.\nWhy?",
        "–A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than\none and a born RACONTEUR if ever there was one. He takes great pride,\nquite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he hasarded,\nstill thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when\nit was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that\nEnglish tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third\ncompanion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to\nthem to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.",
        "There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it\nwas, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his\nfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by\nthe ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell\ncocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he\ncould drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings\nthey had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and\nKatey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells\nand charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in\naccordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on\nthe days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or\nsomething like that.",
        "–No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust in\nthat boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr\nMulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. He\nknows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he\nnever realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you\ndidn’t notice as much as I did. But it wouldn’t occasion me the least\nsurprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in\nyour drink for some ulterior object.",
        "He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile\nallround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly\ncoming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair\nto enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony\nmedical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition\nto which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning\nby artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or\nMalahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed\nwhich he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a\nloss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he\nput it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.",
        "–Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking\nyour brains, he ventured to throw o.ut.",
        "The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by\nfriendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of\nfeatures did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the\nproblem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by\ntwo or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw\nthrough the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself\nallowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that effect\nand he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he\npossessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.",
        "Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round\nwhich a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting\nrid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly\nanimated way, there being some little differences between the parties.",
        "–Puttana Madonna, Che Ci Dia I Quattrini! Ho Ragione? Culo Rotto!",
        "–INTENDIAMOCI. MEZZO SOVRANO PIU ...",
        "–DICE LUI, PERO!",
        "–MEZZO.",
        "–FARABUTTO! MORTACCI SUI!",
        "–MA ASCOLTA! CINQUE LA TESTA PIU ...",
        "Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious\nwooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been\nbefore, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints\nanent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat\nFitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual\nfacts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few\nmoments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner\nonly to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection\nof waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus HOMO\nalready there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation\nfor whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.",
        "–Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to\nbreak the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape\nof solid food, say, a roll of some description.",
        "Accordingly his first act was with characteristic SANGFROID to order\nthese commodities quietly. The HOI POLLOI of jarvies or stevedores or\nwhatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes\napparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual\nportion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for\nsome appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the\nfloor. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having\njust a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be\nsure, rather in a quandary over VOGLIO, remarked to his PROTEGE in an\naudible tone of voice A PROPOS of the battle royal in the street which\nwas still raging fast and furious:",
        "–A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write\nyour poetry in that language? BELLA POETRIA! It is so melodious and full.\nBELLADONNA. VOGLIO.",
        "Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from\nlassitude generally, replied:",
        "–To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.",
        "–Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the\ninward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were\nabsolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds\nit.",
        "The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this TETE-A-TETE put a boiling\nswimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a\nrather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. After which he\nbeat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square\nlook at him later on so as not to appear to. For which reason he\nencouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by\nsurreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be\ncalled coffee gradually nearer him.",
        "–Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,\nlike names. Cicero, Podmore. Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.\nShakespeares were as common as Murphies. What’s in a name?",
        "–Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name\nwas changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.",
        "The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded\nStephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by\nasking:",
        "–And what might your name be?",
        "Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but\nStephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected\nquarter, answered:",
        "–Dedalus.",
        "The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather\nbunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and\nwater.",
        "–You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.",
        "–I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.",
        "Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently\neavesdropping too.",
        "–He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same\nway and nodding. All Irish.",
        "–All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.",
        "As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business\nand he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor\nof his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the\nremark:",
        "–I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his\nshoulder. The lefthand dead shot.",
        "Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures\nbeing also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.",
        "–Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.\nCocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.",
        "He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then he\nscrewed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night\nwith an unprepossessing cast of countenance.",
        "–Pom! he then shouted once.",
        "The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there\nbeing still a further egg.",
        "–Pom! he shouted twice.",
        "Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding\nbloodthirstily:",
        "  –BUFFALO BILL SHOOTS TO KILL,\n    NEVER MISSED NOR HE NEVER WILL.",
        "A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like\nasking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.",
        "–Beg pardon, the sailor said.",
        "–Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.",
        "–Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic\ninfluence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He\ntoured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus. I seen him do that in\nStockholm.",
        "–Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.",
        "–Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.\nKnow where that is?",
        "–Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.",
        "–That’s right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That’s\nwhere I hails from. I belongs there. That’s where I hails from. My little\nwoman’s down there. She’s waiting for me, I know. FOR ENGLAND, HOME AND\nBEAUTY. She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years now,\nsailing about.",
        "Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to\nthe mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy\nnight with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a number of\nstories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden\nand Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O’Leary, a\nfavourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey\nand a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way. Never about the runaway\nwife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The face at the\nwindow! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and\nthe awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his\naffections. You little expected me but I’ve come to stay and make a fresh\nstart. There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes\nme dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or\nTomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in\nshirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father. Broo! The\nwind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, POST MORTEM child. With a high\nro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the\ninevitable. Grin and bear it. I remain with much love your brokenhearted\nhusband D B Murphy.",
        "The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of\nthe jarvies with the request:",
        "–You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?",
        "The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of\nplug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was\npassed from hand to hand.",
        "–Thank you, the sailor said.",
        "He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow\nstammers, proceeded:",
        "–We come up this morning eleven o’clock. The threemaster ROSEVEAN from\nBridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon.\nThere’s my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.",
        "In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket\nand handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.",
        "–You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,\nleaning on the counter.",
        "–Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated\na bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and\nNorth America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage. I\nseen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the\nDardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled\na ship. I seen Russia. GOSPODI POMILYOU. That’s how the Russians prays.",
        "–You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.",
        "–Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queer\nthings too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor\nsame as I chew that quid.",
        "He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his\nteeth, bit ferociously:",
        "–Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and\nthe livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.",
        "He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to\nbe in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. The\nprinted matter on it stated: CHOZA DE INDIOS. BENI, BOLIVIA.",
        "All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage\nwomen in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,\nsleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of\nthem) outside some primitive shanties of osier.",
        "–Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like\nbreadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more\nchildren.",
        "See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver\nraw.",
        "His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for\nseveral minutes if not more.",
        "–Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.",
        "Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:",
        "–Glass. That boggles ’em. Glass.",
        "Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the\ncard to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as\nfollows: TARJETA POSTAL, SENOR A BOUDIN, GALERIA BECCHE, SANTIAGO, CHILE.\nThere was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. Though not\nan implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping\ntransaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don\nCesar de Bazan incident depicted in MARITANA on which occasion the\nformer’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having detected a\ndiscrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented\nhimself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the\ncompass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the\nmissive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s BONA FIDES\nnevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to\none day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via\nlong sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great\nextent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he\nhad consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead\nwhich was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a\npass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up\nwith the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did\ncome to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so\ndear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare\nto Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.\nThe trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in\nevery way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was\nout of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth,\nFalmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the\nsights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where\ndoubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of\nPark lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just struck him as a\nby no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see\nabout trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music\nembracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing\nand firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so\non, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots,\nwhich might prove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and\ncorner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy\ntype lend me your valise and I’ll post you the ticket. No, something top\nnotch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company\nwith his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to\nthe Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was\nquite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be\nmanaged by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the\nindispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. But who?\nThat was the rub.  Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a\ngreat field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to\nkeep pace with the times APROPOS of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which,\nit was mooted, was once more on the TAPIS in the circumlocution\ndepartments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of\neffete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there\ncertainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the\npublic at large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.",
        "It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no\nsmall blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the\nsystem really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry\npounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead\nof being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me\nfor a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum\nmonths of it and merited a radical change of VENUE after the grind of\ncity life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her\nspectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There\nwere equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island,\ndelightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of\nattractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around\nDublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was\na steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow,\nrightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly\nwheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal\nwhere if report spoke true the COUP D’OEIL was exceedingly grand though\nthe lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of\nvisitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal\nbenefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations\nand otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV, rhododendrons\nseveral hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts\nand conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy,\nthough it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design\nor accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only\nabout three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar. Because of course\nuptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to\nspeak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. Interesting to\nfathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was\nwhether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two\nsides in fact. He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and\npassed it along to Stephen.",
        "–I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had\nlittle pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and\nevery pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house,\nanother was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the\nchinks does.",
        "Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the\nglobetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.",
        "–And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his\nback. Knife like that.",
        "Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in\nkeeping with his character and held it in the striking position.",
        "–In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow\nhid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. PREPARE TO MEET YOUR\nGOD, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.",
        "His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further\nquestions even should they by any chance want to.",
        "–That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable\nSTILETTO.",
        "After which harrowing DENOUEMENT sufficient to appal the stoutest he\nsnapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in\nhis chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.",
        "–They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in\nthe dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought the\npark murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them\nusing knives.",
        "At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS\nMr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively\nexchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly ENTRE\nNOUS variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, ALIAS the keeper, not\nturning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. His\ninscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in\nitself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t\nunderstand one jot of what was going on. Funny, very!",
        "There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and\nstarts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the\nnatives CHOZA DE, another the seaman’s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he\nwas personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly\nrecollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as\nyesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land\ntroubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively\nspeaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was\njust turned fifteen.",
        "–Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.",
        "The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.",
        "–Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.",
        "The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or\nno.",
        "–Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he\nhad, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but\nhe failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust,\nand shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.",
        "–What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the\nboats?",
        "Our SOI-DISANT sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:",
        "–I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.\nSalt junk all the time.",
        "Tired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not\nlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,\nfell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the\nglobe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it\ncovered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what\nit meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen at the\nlowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated\nold salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly\nredolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him,\ndreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. And\nit left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find out the secret\nfor himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of\nthing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.\nAnd the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at\nall. Nevertheless, without going into the MINUTIAE of the business, the\neloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the\nnatural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in\nthe face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually\ncontrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell\nidea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same\nlines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a\nhighly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where\nliving inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to\nthem like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and\ncoastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid\nthe elements whatever the season when duty called IRELAND EXPECTS THAT\nEVERY MAN and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the\nwintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to\ncapsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had\nexperienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.",
        "–There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself\na rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s\nvalet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave\nme an oilskin and that jackknife. I’m game for that job, shaving and\nbrushup. I hate roaming about. There’s my son now, Danny, run off to sea\nand his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be\ndrawing easy money.",
        "–What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side,\nbore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from\nthe carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and\na strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.",
        "–Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?\nHe’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.",
        "The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt\nwith his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be\nseen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an\nanchor.",
        "–There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts. I\nmust get a wash tomorrow or next day. It’s them black lads I objects to.\nI hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.",
        "Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his\nshirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the\nmariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young\nman’s sideface looking frowningly rather.",
        "–Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were Iying\nbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the\nname of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.",
        "–Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.",
        "That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the. Someway\nin his. Squeezing or.",
        "–See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And\nthere he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his\nfingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.",
        "And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did\nactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the\nunreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this time\nstretched over.",
        "–Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He’s gone\ntoo. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.",
        "He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression\nof before.",
        "–Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.",
        "–And what’s the number for? loafer number two queried.",
        "–Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.",
        "–Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with\nsome sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of\nthe questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.",
        "And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged\nend:",
        "    –AS BAD AS OLD ANTONIO,\n    FOR HE LEFT ME ON MY OWNIO.",
        "The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat\npeered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her\nown with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom,\nscarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied\nbut outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the\nAbbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he\npicked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink. His\nreason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the\nsame face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond\nquay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady\nin the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of\nhis washing. Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your\nwashing. Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s\nundergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a\nman’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink\n(hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me,\nlove my dirty shirt. Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired\nthe female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief\nwhen the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side\nof the Evening Telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face\nround the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing\nthat she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the\ngroup of gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was\nno more of her.",
        "–The gunboat, the keeper said.",
        "–It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how\na wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease\ncan be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if\nhe values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course I\nsuppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Still no\nmatter what the cause is from ...",
        "Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:",
        "–In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a\nroaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy\nthe soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.",
        "The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude,\nsaid it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop\nto INSTANTER to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any\noldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, w ere not\nlicensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he\ncould truthfully state, he, as a PATERFAMILIAS, was a stalwart advocate\nof from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort,\nhe said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon\non everybody concerned.",
        "–You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe\nin the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as\ndistinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I\nbelieve in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as\nthe convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such\ninventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?",
        "Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try\nand concentrate and remember before he could say:",
        "–They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and\ntherefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the\npossibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can\nhear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other\npractical jokes, CORRUPTIO PER SE and CORRUPTIO PER ACCIDENS both being\nexcluded by court etiquette.",
        "Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the\nmystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he\nfelt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:",
        "–Simple? I shouldn’t think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant\nyou, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue\nmoon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance\nto invent those rays Rontgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I\nbelieve it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same\napplies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon\nsuch as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you\nbelieve in the existence of a supernatural God.",
        "–O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several\nof the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial\nevidence.",
        "On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they\nwere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in\ntheir respective ages, clashed.",
        "–Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his\noriginal point with a smile of unbelief. I’m not so sure about that.\nThat’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the\nsectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you IN TOTO there.\nMy belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine\nforgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big\nquestion of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like\nHAMLET and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better\nthan I, of course I needn’t tell you. Can’t you drink that coffee, by the\nway? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It’s like one of our\nskipper’s bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what he hasn’t got. Try\na bit.",
        "–Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the\nmoment refusing to dictate further.",
        "Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir\nor try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something\napproaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and\nlucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or\nnay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in\nrun on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings\nand useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower\norders. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they\npaid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated\nwith it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her\npianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do\ngood and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. Sulphate\nof copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered\nreading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when\nit was or where. Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables\nseemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the\nvogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis\ninvolved.",
        "–Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being\nstirred.",
        " Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug\nfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and\ntook a sip of the offending beverage.",
        "–Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid\nfood, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but\nregular meals as the SINE QUA NON for any kind of proper work, mental or\nmanual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.",
        "–Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that\nknife. I can’t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.",
        "Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article,\na blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or\nantique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least\nconspicuous point about it.",
        "–Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom APROPOS of\nknives remarked to his CONFIDANTE SOTTO VOCE. Do you think they are\ngenuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and\nlie like old boots. Look at him.",
        "Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full\nof a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was\nquite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire\nfabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability\nin all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.",
        "He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and\nSherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a\nwellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,\nthere was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail\ndelivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate\nsuch a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He\nmight even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told,\nas people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and\nhad served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say\nnothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage\nof identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who\nexpiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. On the\nother hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because\nmeeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting\nnews from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean\nseas to draw the long bow about the schooner HESPERUS and etcetera. And\nwhen all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t\nprobably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows\ncoined about him.",
        "–Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.\nAnalogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants, though\nthat is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget\nqueen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as\nthey are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten their legs\nif you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded,\nindicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever\nyou like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from\nsitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. There’s an\nexample again of simple souls.",
        "However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who\nreminded him a bit of Ludwig, ALIAS Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards\nof the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the\nFLYING DUTCHMAN, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in\nlarge numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any\nsort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as\nalso did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it,\nhe conceded. On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in\nkeeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to\nadmit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the\nchip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the\nCoombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too\ngiven to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline\npersuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin\nwith garlic DE RIGUEUR off him or her next day on the quiet and, he\nadded, on the cheap.",
        "–Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like\nthat, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own\nhands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they\ncarry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My\nwife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could\nactually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in\n(technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite\ndark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate\naccounts for character. That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry\nin Italian.",
        "–The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very\npassionate about ten shillings. ROBERTO RUBA ROBA SUA.",

        "–It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the\nblood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street\nmuseum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I\nwas just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions\nof hips, bosom. You simply don’t knock against those kind of women here.\nAn exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but\nwhat I’m talking about is the female form. Besides they have so little\ntaste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman’s natural\nbeauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly\nis, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing I simply hate to see.",
        "Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the\nothers got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, goo\ncollisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course had\nhis own say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered\na monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils\nof the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to\nthat effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.",

That was the talk of the town\nthat year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of\ndistinctive merit on the topic for the Irish TIMES), breakers running\nover her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with\nhorror. Then someone said something about the case of the S. S. LADY\nCAIRNS of Swansea run into by the MONA which was on an opposite tack in\nrather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid was\ngiven. Her master, the MONA’S, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead\nwould give way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.",
        "At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him to\nunfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.",
        "–Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just\ngently dropping off into a peaceful doze.",
        "He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,\nstepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore\ndue left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who\nnoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum\nsticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his\nburning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and,\napplying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of\nit with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd\nsuspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the\ncounterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to\nall intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly\nrefreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders\nof the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all\nradically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person\nor persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the\ncleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief\nspace of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently\ngiving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his\nbilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it\napparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped anyway for new\nfoothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his\nsentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation\nstones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other\nin stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish\nrates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from\ndictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his\nbox before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly\namazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most\nrespectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his\nlife who came in for a cool 100 pounds a year at one time which of course\nthe doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.\nAnd there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the\ntown tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver. He drank needless to be\ntold and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be\nin a large way of business if–a big if, however–he had contrived to\ncure himself of his particular partiality.",
        "All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,\ncoastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same\nthing.

Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate\nthe plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the\ntime being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs\nand found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in he\nrolled after his successful libation-CUM-potation, introducing an\natmosphere of drink into the SOIREE, boisterously trolling, like a\nveritable son of a seacook:",

        "After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene\nand regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form\nprovided. Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to\ngrind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the\nnatural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described\nin his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face\nof God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large\nquantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten\nmillions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by\nEngland levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose\nalways and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus\nsteam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became general and\nall agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal thing in Irish\nsoil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan\ngrowing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon?\nBut a day of reckoning, he stated CRESCENDO with no uncertain voice,\nthoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty\nEngland, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. There would\nbe a fall and the greatest fall in history. The Germans and the Japs were\ngoing to have their little lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the\nbeginning of the end. Brummagem England was toppling already and her\ndownfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them\nabout the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his\nauditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by\nshowing the tendon referred to on his boot. His advice to every Irishman\nwas: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for\nIreland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.",
        "Silence all round marked the termination of his FINALE. The impervious\nnavigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.",

        "While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added\nhe cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman\nworthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few\nirascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to\nthe listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as\nthey didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.",
        "From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was\nrather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,\npending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was\nfully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel,\nunless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather\nconcealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with\nthe quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the\ncoal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went\non, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say\non the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to\nthe issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to\ntry to make the most of both countries even though poles apart. Another\nlittle interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in\ncommon parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for\nEngland as against her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene\nbetween the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or\nhave been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously\nbogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence\ntrick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student\nof the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And\nas for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all,\nhe (B.) couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give\npeople like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether\nand refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private\nlife and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a\nDannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like\nDenis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from\nthat he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet,\nthough such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom\nin any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while\ninwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man\nwho had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his\npolitical convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to\nany such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south,\nhave her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words\npassed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky\nmortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his\nadored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial LIAISON by plunging\nhis knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-\nthe-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage\nand so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush\nwhich, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin\non. In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our\nfriend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his\nwelcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.\nLike actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up\nsmiling again. Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no\neconomising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the\nshadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever\ngot rid of some l s d. in the course of his perambulations round the\ndocks in the congenial atmosphere of the OLD IRELAND tavern, come back to\nErin and so on. Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the\nsame identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually\nsilenced the offender.",
        "–He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the\nwhole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and in\na heated fashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain facts in\nthe least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his\nfamily like me though in reality I’m not. That was one for him. A soft\nanswer turns away wrath. He hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone\nsaw. Am I not right?",

It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right\nand wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though\nevery country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government\nit deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It’s all very fine to\nboast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality. I resent\nviolence and intolerance in any shape or form.

        "Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was\noverwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.",
        "–You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of\nconflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely ...",
        "All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad\nblood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously\nsupposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely\na question of the money question which was at the back of everything\ngreed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.",

        "–Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of\nruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would\nyou be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the\ninquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an\nuncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for,\nimported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. They\nare practical and are proved to be so. I don’t want to indulge in any\nbecause you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as\nyou are. But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest\nspells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead\nAmerica. Turks. It’s in the dogma. Because if they didn’t believe they’d\ngo straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better, at least\nso I think. That’s the juggle on which the p.p’s raise the wind on false\npretences. I’m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as\nthat rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see\neveryone, concluded he, all creeds and classes PRO RATA having a\ncomfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in\nthe neighbourhood of 300 pounds per annum. That’s the vital issue at\nstake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier\nintercourse between man and man. At least that’s my idea for what it’s\nworth. I call that patriotism.

        "Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this\nsynopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.\nHe could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those\ncrabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of\ndifferent sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath\nor seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say\nthe words the voice he heard said, if you work.",
        "–Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.",
        "The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who\nowned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must\nwork, have to, together.",
        "–I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest\npossible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the\nthing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.\nThat’s work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of\nyou, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to\nrecoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit as much right\nto live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.\nWhat? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is\nequally important.",
        "–You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may\nbe 1160 important because I belong to the FAUBOURG SAINT PATRICE called\nIreland for short.",
        "–I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.",
        "–But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important\nbecause it belongs to me.",
        "–What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under\nsome misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the latter\nportion. What was it you ...?",
        "Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of\ncoffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:  1170",
        "–We can’t change the country. Let us change the subject.",
        "At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down\nbut in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put\non belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some kind was\nclearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy\nspoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his\nsober state. Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost\nimportance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been\nfamiliarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear for the\nyoung man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some\nconsternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more\nespecially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw\nmuch light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of\ncultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of\npremature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance there\nwas the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably\nconnected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose\nother gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody\nall round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit\nof brown paper (a fact). And then the usual DENOUEMENT after the fun had\ngone on fast and furious he got 1190 landed into hot water and had to be\nspirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from\nJohn Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under\nsection two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those\nsubpoenaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur\nto anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly, putting two and two together,\nsix sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so\nforth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the\nseventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life\nthe occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the\nupper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of\nthe head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and\ncrowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a\nnumber of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by\nnature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on\nthough not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was\nexcept women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another\nit being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.

Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his\nvarious different political arrangements were nearing completion or\nwhether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change\nhis boots and clothes-after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to\nconsult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually\ndied of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or\nquite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of\ntheir hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even\nbefore there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were\ndecidedly of the ALICE, WHERE ART THOU order even prior to his starting\nto go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which\nemanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.\nNaturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which\nundoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate\nfive feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So\nwho, though they weren’t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost\nafter their redeeming features were very few and far between. It\ncertainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then\nseventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual\nmudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come back.\nThat haunting sense kind of drew you. To show the understudy in the title\nROLE how to. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke\nup the type in the INSUPPRESSIBLE or was it UNITED IRELAND, a privilege\nhe keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat\nwhen it was knocked off and he said THANK YOU, excited as he undoubtedly\nwas under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure\nmentioned between the cup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone. Still as\nregards return. You were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at\nyou directly you got back. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed,\nTom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number one, you came up\nagainst the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like\nthe claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, BELLA was\nthe boat’s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down\nin as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian\nink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the\ndetails from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with\nthe description given, introduce himself with: EXCUSE ME, MY NAME IS SO\nAND SO or some such commonplace remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom\nsaid to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage\nunder discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land\nfirst.",
        "–That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor\ncommented. She put the first nail in his coffin.",
        "–Fine lump of a woman all the same, the SOI-DISANT townclerk Henry\nCampbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a man’s thighs. I\nseen her picture in a barber’s. The husband was a captain or an officer.",
        "–Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.",
        "This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair\namount of laughter among his ENTOURAGE. As regards Bloom he, without the\nfaintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door\nand reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary\ninterest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made\npublic with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full\nof sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened\nand an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to\na climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering\nblow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however,\nwho were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was\npublic property all along though not to anything like the sensational\nextent that it subsequently blossomed into. Since their names were\ncoupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the\nparticular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the\nhousetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came\nout in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court\nliterally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to\nhaving witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of\nscrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder\nin night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact\nthe weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of\nmoney out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a\ncase of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common\nbetween them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene,\nstrong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and\nforgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s\nsmiles. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say,\ncropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in\nthe case, exist between married folk? Poser. Though it was no concern of\ntheirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a\nwave of folly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented\nobviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military\nsupernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday FAREWELL, MY\nGALLANT CAPTAIN kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the l8th\nhussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader,\nthat is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course,\nwoman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which\nhe almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as\na whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants\nfor whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by\ntaking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most\nsanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose,\nthereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the\nfabled ass’s kick. Looking back now in a retrospective kind of\narrangement all seemed a kind of dream. And then coming back was the\nworst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel\nout of place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected,\nIrishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of\nyears looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside\non the north side. North or south, however, it was just the wellknown\ncase of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a\nvengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was\nSpanish or half so, types that wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate\nabandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.",
        "–Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to\nStephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don’t greatly mistake she was\nSpanish too.",
        "–The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or\nother rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and\nthe first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and\nso many.",
        "–Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any\nmeans, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it\nwas as she lived there. So, Spain.",
        "Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket SWEETS OF, which reminded him by\nthe by of that Cap l street library book out of date, he took out his\npocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly\nfinally he.",
        "–Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded\nphoto which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?",
        "Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large\nsized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she\nwas in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously\nlow for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than\nvision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing\nnear, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was IN OLD\nMADRID, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her\n(the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about\nsomething to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin’s\npremier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic\nexecution.",
        "–Mrs Bloom, my wife the PRIMA DONNA Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom\nindicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like her\nthen.",
        "Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his 1440\nlegal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major\nBrian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a\nsinger having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered\nbarely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking likeness in\nexpression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a\nlot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in\nthat getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the\nensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt, being\na bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general\ndevelopmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon\nhe had seen those Grecian statues, 1450 perfectly developed as works of\nart, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders,\nback, all the symmetry, all the rest. Yes, puritanisme, it does though\nSaint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop. Whereas\nno photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word.",
        "The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s good\nexample and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for\nitself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for\nhimself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the\ncamera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional\netiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet\nwonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.\nAnd he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind\nof inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.\nNevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased\nby opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away\nthoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s\npossible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving EMBONPOINT.\nIn fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen\nslightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.\nSuppose she was gone when he? I looked for the lamp which she told me\ncame into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then\nrecollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby\nwith met him pike hoses (SIC) in it which must have fell down\nsufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies\nto Lindley Murray.",
        "The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, DISTINGUE\nand impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though\nyou wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would. Besides he said the\npicture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the\nmoment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of\nmakebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur\nwith the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial\ntangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage\nfavourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole\nbusiness. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between\nthe two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in\ncourt with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising\nexpressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or\nthree times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when\nthe thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. Then the\ndecree NISI and the King’s proctor tries to show cause why and, he\nfailing to quash it, NISI was made absolute. But as for that the two\nmisdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could\nsafely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was\nput in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party\nwronged in due course. He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to\nErin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the\nhistoric FRACAS when the fallen leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his\nguns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery,\n(leader’s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly\neven more than that penetrated into the printing works of the\nINSUPPRESSIBLE or no it was UNITED IRELAND (a by no means by the by\nappropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or\nsomething like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the\nfacile pens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation\nreflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals. Though palpably a\nradically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly\ngarbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way\nwith the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture\nthat their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which\nshe, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot\ntimes in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a\nnasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated\nlodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a\ngrave character. His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked\noff and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it\nup in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to\nhim (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting\nand hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time\nall the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a\nmatter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than\nanything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at\nhis mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at\nonce because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect\nAPLOMB, saying: THANK YOU, SIR, though in a very different tone of voice\nfrom the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set\nto rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with\na difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him\nalone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to\nthe grave.",
        "On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes\nof the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing 1530\nimmoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the\nwherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case\nfor the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate\nhusband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from\nthe usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial\nmoment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms, drawing\nattention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic\nrumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master\nupon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his\nvisits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter\nand let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with\nher tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there\nwere several others. He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed\nand didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men\nin the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a\nlady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on\nfairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her\nduties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little\nflutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with\nimproper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another,\nthe cause of many LIAISONS between still attractive married women getting\non for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases\nof feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.",
        "It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of\nbrains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time\nwith profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him\nhis lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take\nunto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim\nladies’ society was a CONDITIO SINE QUA NON though he had the gravest\npossible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about\nMiss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought\nhim down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would\nfind much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the\ncompany of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly\nwith the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out\nleading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs. To think of him\nhouse and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother,\nwas really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out\nwith attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or\nlike his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even\nwere it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or,\nfailing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.",
        "–At what o’clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired\nthough unwrinkled face.",
        "–Some time yesterday, Stephen said.",
        "–Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow\nFriday. Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!",
        "–The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.",
        "Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. Though\nthey didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow\nwas as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train\nof thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of\nyears previously when he had been a QUASI aspirant to parliamentary\nhonours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect\n(which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking\nregard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the evicted tenants\nquestion, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people’s mind\nthough, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his\nfaith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn’t exactly hold\nwater, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough\nsympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion\n(a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently\npartially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than\nMichael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a\nbacktothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo\nput upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of\nthe clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that he, though often considerably\nmisunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated,\ndeparted from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the\ngizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only\ntoo conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and\ndisplays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as\na foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the\nfittest, in a word.",
        "Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was,\nit was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit\nrisky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody\nhaving a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on\nthe night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame\npaw (not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he\nhad hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly\nremembered, having been there, so to speak. On the other hand it was\naltogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove\nsuggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two\nalternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail\nhimself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. His\ninitial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive\nbut it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn’t what you call jump\nat the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn’t\nknow how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain\nthe proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he\nwould allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found\nsuitable. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the\nnonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the\nnight plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at\nleast he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he\nfailed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the\nproviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be made\nbecause that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to\nbe glued to the spot, didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his\nway home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some\nsponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff\nstreet lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s\nwhereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings\n(the mermaids’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the\ntropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling\ntheir largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the\naccompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about\nhimself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and\naddress, as Mr Algebra remarks PASSIM. At the same time he inwardly\nchuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about\nhis god being a jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but\nwhat properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable\npoint too of tender Achilles. Your god was a jew.

        "–I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while\nprudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come\nhome with me and talk things over.

        "The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain\nsailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper\nof the shanty who didn’t seem to.",
        "–Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that\nBrazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.",

        "Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,\nfound drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a\nhundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time\n(completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied\nloosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched\nhim as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were\nsufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,\nthat is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial\nremark.",
        "To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to\nrise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and\nforemost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the\noccasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host\nas a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not\nlooking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand\ntotal of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four\ncoppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously\nspotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in\nunmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well\nworth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.",
        "–Come, he counselled to close the SEANCE.",
        "Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter\nor shanty together and the ELITE society of oilskin and company whom\nnothing short of an earthquake would move out of their DOLCE FAR NIENTE.\nStephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at\nthe, for a moment, the door.",
        "–One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the\nmoment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside\ndown, on the tables in cafes. To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom\nreplied without a moment’s hesitation, saying straight off:",
        "–To sweep the floor in the morning.",
        "So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time\napologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the bye,\nhis right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night\nair was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on\nhis pins.",
        "–It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a\nmoment. The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man. Come.\nIt’s not far. Lean on me.",
        "Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on\naccordingly.",
        "–Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind\nof flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all\nthat.",
        "Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where the\nmunicipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes\nwrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh\nfields and pastures new. And APROPOS of coffin of stones the analogy was\nnot at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of\nseventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of\nthe split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame\nevicted tenants he had put in their holdings.",
        "So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom,\nas a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm\nin arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand\nin its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first\ngo-off but the music of Mercadante’s HUGUENOTS, Meyerbeer’s SEVEN LAST\nWORDS ON THE CROSS and Mozart’s TWELFTH MASS he simply revelled in, the\nGLORIA in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such,\nliterally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. He infinitely\npreferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the\nopposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey\nhymns or BID ME TO LIVE AND I WILL LIVE THY PROTESTANT TO BE. He also\nyielded to none in his admiration of Rossini’s STABAT MATER, a work\nsimply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion\nTweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly\nadding to her other laureis and putting the others totally in the shade,\nin the jesuit fathers’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred\nedifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or\nVIRTUOSI rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to\ncome up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a\nsacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On\nthe whole though favouring preferably light opera of the DON GIOVANNI\ndescription and MARTHA, a gem in its line, he had a PENCHANT, though with\nonly a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as\nMendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about\nthe old favourites, he mentioned PAR EXCELLENCE Lionel’s air in MARTHA,\nM’APPARI, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more\naccurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips\nof Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number,\nin fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to\na politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but launched out into\npraises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or about that period, the\nlutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who\nANNO LUDENDO HAUSI, DOULANDUS, an instrument he was contemplating\npurchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though\nthe name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby\nand son with their DUX and COMES conceits and Byrd (William) who played\nthe virginals, he said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found\nthem and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.",
        "On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond\nthe swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,\nbrushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not\nperfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive\nguineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political\ncelebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a\nstriking coincidence.",
        "By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom,\nwho was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s sleeve\ngently, jocosely remarking:",
        "–Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.",
        "They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth\nanything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite\nnear so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh\nbecause palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a\ntaildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the\nlord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a\ngood poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely\nreflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might\ncrop up. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse,\nwithout a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected, take\nthat mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the same size, would be a holy\nhorror to face. But it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was\nbuilt that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into\npotheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained,\nnothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale with a harpoon\nhairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke,\nchalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. These timely\nreflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat\ndistracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was\nmanoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.",
        "–What’s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging IN\nMEDIAS RES, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your\nacquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.",
        "He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,\nimage of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome\nblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as\nhe was perhaps not that way built.",
        "Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it\nopened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish industries,\nconcert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.",
        "Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air YOUTH HERE HAS END\nby Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come\nfrom. Even more he liked an old German song of JOHANNES JEEP about the\nclear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled\nBloom a bit:",
        "    VON DER SIRENEN LISTIGKEIT\n    TUN DIE POETEN DICHTEN.",
        "These opening bars he sang and translated EXTEMPORE. Bloom, nodding, said\nhe perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he\ndid.",
        "A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,\nwhich Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily,\nif properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such\nas Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its\nown price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate\npossessor in the near future an ENTREE into fashionable houses in the\nbest residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of\nbusiness and titled people where with his university degree of B. A. (a\nhuge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the\ngood impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being\nblessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and\nother requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the\nbetter worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in–\nsociety’s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like\nthat could militate against you. It was in fact only a matter of months\nand he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and\nartistic CONVERSAZIONES during the festivities of the Christmas season,\nfor choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and\nbeing made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he\nhappened to know, were on record–in fact, without giving the show away,\nhe himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added to\nwhich of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be\nsneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he\nparenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily\nembrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of\ntime. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and\nboth monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in\nthe smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a\ncheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though\ntaste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that,\ndifferent from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as\nit would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the usual\nhackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan\nSt Austell and Hilton St Just and their GENUS OMNE. Yes, beyond a shadow\nof a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital\nopening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s\nesteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a\ngrand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup,\nif one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big IF,\nhowever, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable\nprocrastination which often tripped -up a too much feted prince of good\nfellows. And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his\nown master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his\nspare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his\nvocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a\nmatter for himself alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that\nwas the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose\nfor smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.",
        "The horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he\npurposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on\nthe FOOLS STEP IN WHERE ANGELS principle, advising him to sever his\nconnection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone\nto disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when\nnot present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in\nBloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s\ncharacter, no pun intended.",
        "The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and,\nrearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on\nthe floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking\nglobes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full\ncrupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had\nended, patient in his scythed car.",
        "Side by side Bloom, profiting by the CONTRETEMPS, with Stephen passed\nthrough the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over\na strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen\nsinging more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.",
        "    Und Alle Schiffe Brucken.",
        "The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely\nwatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one\nfull, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, TO BE MARRIED BY FATHER\nMAHER. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing\ntheir TETE-A-TETE (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens\nenemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the\nsame category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in\nthe sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in\nany case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in\nhis seat near the end of lower Gardiner street AND LOOKED AFTER THEIR\nLOWBACKED CAR.",
        "What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?",
        "Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they\nfollowed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and\nMountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,\nGardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of\nTemple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing\nright, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching,\ndisparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before\nGeorge’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than\nthe arc which it subtends.",
        "Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?",
        "Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,\nprostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and\nglowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed\ncorporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,\necclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the\nstudy of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the\npresabbath, Stephen’s collapse.",
        "Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective\nlike and unlike reactions to experience?",
        "Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to\nplastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner\nof life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both\nindurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of\nheterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox\nreligious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the\nalternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual\nmagnetism.",
        "Were their views on some points divergent?",
        "Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of dietary\nand civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s views on\nthe eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom\nassented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved\nin assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to\nchristianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,\nson of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of\nLeary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (died\n266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and\ninterred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric\ninanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of\nadulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and\nthe velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen\nattributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both\nfrom two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first\nno bigger than a woman’s hand.",
        "Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?",
        "The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining\nparaheliotropic trees.",
        "Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in\nthe past?",
        "In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public\nthoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and Leonard’s\ncorner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.",
        "In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall\nbetween Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of\nUppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and\nprospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class\nrailway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian\nTweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on\nthe lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once\nin 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour\nof his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street, west.",
        "What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,\n1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their\ndestination?",
        "He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual\ndevelopment and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction\nof the converse domain of interindividual relations.",
        "As in what ways?",
        "From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:\nexistence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence\nto nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.",
        "What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?",
        "At the housesteps of the 4th Of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number\n7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket\nof his trousers to obtain his latchkey.",
        "Was it there?",
        "It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on\nthe day but one preceding.",
        "Why was he doubly irritated?",
        "Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded\nhimself twice not to forget.",
        "What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively)\nand inadvertently, keyless couple?",
        "To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.",
        "Bloom’s decision?",
        "A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area\nrailings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower\nunion of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of\nfive feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the\narea pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating\nhimself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of\nthe fall.",
        "Did he fall?",
        "By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois\nmeasure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical\nselfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist\nof 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to\nwit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine\nhundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six\nhundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and\ntwentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C\nB, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.",
        "Did he rise uninjured by concussion?",
        "Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by\nthe impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at\nits freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its\nfulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent\nscullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal\ngas by turningon the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he\nreduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.",
        "What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?",
        "Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent\nkitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a\ncandle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man\nleaving the kitchen holding a candle.",
        "Did the man reappear elsewhere?",
        "After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible\nthrough the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the\nhalldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space\nof the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.",
        "Did Stephen obey his sign?",
        "Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed\nsoftly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted\ncandle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a\nturning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom’s\nhouse.",
        "What did Bloom do?",
        "He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its\nflame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen\nwith its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary,\nknelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped\nsticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram\ncoal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and\nM’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of\npaper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential\nenergy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements\nto enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.",
        "Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?",
        "Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,\nhad kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the\ncollege of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county\nof Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his\nfirst residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his\ngodmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia\nMorkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard)\nGoulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil street: of\nhis mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve\nNorth Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier\n1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics’ theatre of\nuniversity College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of his sister Dilly\n(Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra.",
        "What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the\nfire towards the opposite wall?",
        "Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,\nstretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the\nchimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded\nunattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’\ngrey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position\nclamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the\nthird at their point of junction.",
        "What did Bloom see on the range?",
        "On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left\n(larger) hob a black iron kettle.",
        "What did Bloom do at the range?",
        "He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle\nto the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it\nflow.",
        "Did it flow?",
        "Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of\n2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of\nfilter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant\ncost of 5 pounds per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of\nthe Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a\ndistance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving\ntanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge,\nupper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply\nof 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the\noverflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks\nengineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.

        "What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?",
        "The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event\nfollowed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the\nelectrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by\nfailure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding\noriginally from a successful interpretation.",
        "His mood?",
        "He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he\nwas satisfied.",
        "What satisfied him?",

        "Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of\nhospitality?",

        "What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?",
        "Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was\nengaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from\nliterature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had\napplied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the\nsolution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.",

G.\nJohnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,\nentitled IF BRIAN BORU COULD BUT COME BACK AND SEE OLD DUBLIN NOW,\ncommissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,\n49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the\nvalley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand\nannual Christmas pantomime SINBAD THE SAILOR (produced by R Shelton 26\nDecember 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A.\nJackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the\npersonal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir,\nharlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?",

        "16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen’s present age Stephen\nwas 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom’s present\nage Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54\ntheir ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13\n1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as\narbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883\nhad continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904\nwhen Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be\n38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen\nwould have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190\nyears alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221\nyears the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while,\nif Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the\nyear 3072 A.D., Bloomwould have been obliged to have been alive 83,300\nyears, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.",
