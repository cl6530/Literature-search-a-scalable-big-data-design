        "In the heat of the glowing July afternoon, the room, with blinds\ncarefully closed, was full of a great calm. From the three windows,\nthrough the cracks of the old wooden shutters, came only a few\nscattered sunbeams which, in the midst of the obscurity, made a soft\nbrightness that bathed surrounding objects in a diffused and tender\nlight. It was cool here in comparison with the overpowering heat that\nwas felt outside, under the fierce rays of the sun that blazed upon\nthe front of the house.",
        "Standing before the press which faced the windows, Dr. Pascal was\nlooking for a paper that he had come in search of. With doors wide\nopen, this immense press of carved oak, adorned with strong and\nhandsome mountings of metal, dating from the last century, displayed\nwithin its capacious depths an extraordinary collection of papers and\nmanuscripts of all sorts, piled up in confusion and filling every\nshelf to overflowing. For more than thirty years the doctor had thrown\ninto it every page he wrote, from brief notes to the complete texts of\nhis great works on heredity. Thus it was that his searches here were\nnot always easy. He rummaged patiently among the papers, and when he\nat last found the one he was looking for, he smiled.",
        "For an instant longer he remained near the bookcase, reading the note\nby a golden sunbeam that came to him from the middle window. He\nhimself, in this dawnlike light, appeared, with his snow-white hair\nand beard, strong and vigorous; although he was near sixty, his color\nwas so fresh, his features were so finely cut, his eyes were still so\nclear, and he had so youthful an air that one might have taken him, in\nhis close-fitting, maroon velvet jacket, for a young man with powdered\nhair.",
        "“Here, Clotilde,” he said at last, “you will copy this note. Ramond\nwould never be able to decipher my diabolical writing.”",
        "And he crossed the room and laid the paper beside the young girl, who\nstood working at a high desk in the embrasure of the window to the\nright.",
        "“Very well, master,” she answered.",
        "She did not even turn round, so engrossed was her attention with the\npastel which she was at the moment rapidly sketching in with broad\nstrokes of the crayon. Near her in a vase bloomed a stalk of\nhollyhocks of a singular shade of violet, striped with yellow. But the\nprofile of her small round head, with its short, fair hair, was\nclearly distinguishable; an exquisite and serious profile, the\nstraight forehead contracted in a frown of attention, the eyes of an\nazure blue, the nose delicately molded, the chin firm. Her bent neck,\nespecially, of a milky whiteness, looked adorably youthful under the\ngold of the clustering curls. In her long black blouse she seemed very\ntall, with her slight figure, slender throat, and flexible form, the\nflexible slenderness of the divine figures of the Renaissance. In\nspite of her twenty-five years, she still retained a childlike air and\nlooked hardly eighteen.",
        "“And,” resumed the doctor, “you will arrange the press a little.\nNothing can be found there any longer.”",
        "“Very well, master,” she repeated, without raising her head;\n“presently.”",
        "Pascal had turned round to seat himself at his desk, at the other end\nof the room, before the window to the left. It was a plain black\nwooden table, and was littered also with papers and pamphlets of all\nsorts. And silence again reigned in the peaceful semi-obscurity,\ncontrasting with the overpowering glare outside. The vast apartment, a\ndozen meters long and six wide, had, in addition to the press, only\ntwo bookcases, filled with books. Antique chairs of various kinds\nstood around in disorder, while for sole adornment, along the walls,\nhung with an old salon Empire paper of a rose pattern, were nailed\npastels of flowers of strange coloring dimly visible. The woodwork of\nthree folding-doors, the door opening on the hall and two others at\nopposite ends of the apartment, the one leading to the doctor’s room,\nthe other to that of the young girl, as well as the cornice of the\nsmoke-darkened ceiling, dated from the time of Louis XV.",
        "An hour passed without a sound, without a breath. Then Pascal, who, as\na diversion from his work, had opened a newspaper–Le Temps–which\nhad lain forgotten on the table, uttered a slight exclamation:",
        "“Why! your father has been appointed editor of the Epoque, the\nprosperous republican journal which has the publishing of the papers\nof the Tuileries.”",
        "This news must have been unexpected by him, for he laughed frankly, at\nonce pleased and saddened, and in an undertone he continued:",
        "“My word! If things had been invented, they could not have been finer.\nLife is a strange thing. This is a very interesting article.”",
        "Clotilde made no answer, as if her thoughts were a hundred leagues\naway from what her uncle was saying. And he did not speak again, but\ntaking his scissors after he had read the article, he cut it out and\npasted it on a sheet of paper, on which he made some marginal notes in\nhis large, irregular handwriting. Then he went back to the press to\nclassify this new document in it. But he was obliged to take a chair,\nthe shelf being so high that he could not reach it notwithstanding his\ntall stature.",
        "On this high shelf a whole series of enormous bundles of papers were\narranged in order, methodically classified. Here were papers of all\nsorts: sheets of manuscript, documents on stamped paper, articles cut\nout of newspapers, arranged in envelopes of strong blue paper, each of\nwhich bore on the outside a name written in large characters. One felt\nthat these documents were tenderly kept in view, taken out\ncontinually, and carefully replaced; for of the whole press, this\ncorner was the only one kept in order.",
        "When Pascal, mounted on the chair, had found the package he was\nlooking for, one of the bulkiest of the envelopes, on which was\nwritten the name “Saccard,” he added to it the new document, and then\nreplaced the whole under its corresponding alphabetical letter. A\nmoment later he had forgotten the subject, and was complacently\nstraightening a pile of papers that were falling down. And when he at\nlast jumped down off the chair, he said:",
        "“When you are arranging the press, Clotilde, don’t touch the packages\nat the top; do you hear?”",
        "“Very well, master,” she responded, for the third time, docilely.",
        "He laughed again, with the gaiety that was natural to him.",
        "“That is forbidden.”",
        "“I know it, master.”",
        "And he closed the press with a vigorous turn of the key, which he then\nthrew into a drawer of his writing table. The young girl was\nsufficiently acquainted with his researches to keep his manuscripts in\nsome degree of order; and he gladly employed her as his secretary; he\nmade her copy his notes when some confrere and friend, like Dr.\nRamond asked him to send him some document. But she was not a\nsavante; he simply forbade her to read what he deemed it useless\nthat she should know.",
        "At last, perceiving her so completely absorbed in her work, his\nattention was aroused.",
        "“What is the matter with you, that you don’t open your lips?” he said.\n“Are you so taken up with the copying of those flowers that you can’t\nspeak?”",
        "This was another of the labors which he often intrusted to her–to\nmake drawings, aquarelles, and pastels, which he afterward used in his\nworks as plates. Thus, for the past five years he had been making some\ncurious experiments on a collection of hollyhocks; he had obtained a\nwhole series of new colorings by artificial fecundations. She made\nthese sorts of copies with extraordinary minuteness, an exactitude of\ndesign and of coloring so extreme that he marveled unceasingly at the\nconscientiousness of her work, and he often told her that she had a\n“good, round, strong, clear little headpiece.”",
        "But, this time, when he approached her to look over her shoulder, he\nuttered a cry of comic fury.",
        "“There you are at your nonsense! Now you are off in the clouds again!\nWill you do me the favor to tear that up at once?”",
        "She straightened herself, her cheeks flushed, her eyes aglow with the\ndelight she took in her work, her slender fingers stained with the red\nand blue crayon that she had crushed.",
        "“Oh, master!”",
        "And in this “master,” so tender, so caressingly submissive, this term\nof complete abandonment by which she called him, in order to avoid\nusing the words godfather or uncle, which she thought silly, there\nwas, for the first time, a passionate accent of revolt, the\nrevindication of a being recovering possession of and asserting\nitself.",
        "For nearly two hours she had been zealously striving to produce an\nexact and faithful copy of the hollyhocks, and she had just thrown on\nanother sheet a whole bunch of imaginary flowers, of dream-flowers,\nextravagant and superb. She had, at times, these abrupt shiftings, a\nneed of breaking away in wild fancies in the midst of the most precise\nof reproductions. She satisfied it at once, falling always into this\nextraordinary efflorescence of such spirit and fancy that it never\nrepeated itself; creating roses, with bleeding hearts, weeping tears\nof sulphur, lilies like crystal urns, flowers without any known form,\neven, spreading out starry rays, with corollas floating like clouds.\nTo-day, on a groundwork dashed in with a few bold strokes of black\ncrayon, it was a rain of pale stars, a whole shower of infinitely soft\npetals; while, in a corner, an unknown bloom, a bud, chastely veiled,\nwas opening.",
        "“Another to nail there!” resumed the doctor, pointing to the wall, on\nwhich there was already a row of strangely curious pastels. “But what\nmay that represent, I ask you?”",
        "She remained very grave, drawing back a step, the better to\ncontemplate her work.",
        "“I know nothing about it; it is beautiful.”",
        "At this moment appeared Martine, the only servant, become the real\nmistress of the house, after nearly thirty years of service with the\ndoctor. Although she had passed her sixtieth year, she, too, still\nretained a youthful air as she went about, silent and active, in her\neternal black gown and white cap that gave her the look of a nun, with\nher small, white, calm face, and lusterless eyes, the light in which\nseemed to have been extinguished.",
        "Without speaking, she went and sat down on the floor before an\neasy-chair, through a rent in the old covering of which the hair was\nescaping, and drawing from her pocket a needle and a skein of worsted,\nshe set to work to mend it. For three days past she had been waiting\nfor an hour’s time to do this piece of mending, which haunted her.",
        "“While you are about it, Martine,” said Pascal jestingly, taking\nbetween both his hands the mutinous head of Clotilde, “sew me fast,\ntoo, this little noodle, which sometimes wanders off into the clouds.”",
        "Martine raised her pale eyes, and looked at her master with her\nhabitual air of adoration?”",
        "“Why does monsieur say that?”",
        "“Because, my good girl, in very truth, I believe it is you who have\nstuffed this good little round, clear, strong headpiece full of\nnotions of the other world, with all your devoutness.”",
        "The two women exchanged a glance of intelligence.",
        "“Oh, monsieur! religion has never done any harm to any one. And when\npeople have not the same ideas, it is certainly better not to talk\nabout them.”",
        "An embarrassed silence followed; this was the one difference of\nopinion which, at times, brought about disagreements among these three\nunited beings who led so restricted a life. Martine was only\ntwenty-nine, a year older than the doctor, when she entered his house,\nat the time when he made his debut as a physician at Plassans, in a\nbright little house of the new town. And thirteen years later, when\nSaccard, a brother of Pascal, sent him his daughter Clotilde, aged\nseven, after his wife’s death and at the moment when he was about to\nmarry again, it was she who brought up the child, taking it to church,\nand communicating to it a little of the devout flame with which she\nhad always burned; while the doctor, who had a broad mind, left them\nto their joy of believing, for he did not feel that he had the right\nto interdict to any one the happiness of faith; he contented himself\nlater on with watching over the young girl’s education and giving her\nclear and sound ideas about everything. For thirteen years, during\nwhich the three had lived this retired life at La Souleiade, a small\nproperty situated in the outskirts of the town, a quarter of an hour’s\nwalk from St. Saturnin, the cathedral, his life had flowed happily\nalong, occupied in secret great works, a little troubled, however, by\nan ever increasing uneasiness–the collision, more and more violent,\nevery day, between their beliefs.",
        "Pascal took a few turns gloomily up and down the room. Then, like a\nman who did not mince his words, he said:",
        "“See, my dear, all this phantasmagoria of mystery has turned your\npretty head. Your good God had no need of you; I should have kept you\nfor myself alone; and you would have been all the better for it.”",
        "But Clotilde, trembling with excitement, her clear eyes fixed boldly\nupon his, held her ground.",
        "“It is you, master, who would be all the better, if you did not shut\nyourself up in your eyes of flesh. That is another thing, why do you\nnot wish to see?”",
        "And Martine came to her assistance, in her own style.",
        "“Indeed, it is true, monsieur, that you, who are a saint, as I say\neverywhere, should accompany us to church. Assuredly, God will save\nyou. But at the bare idea that you should not go straight to paradise,\nI tremble all over.”",
        "He paused, for he had before him, in open revolt, those two whom he\nhad been accustomed to see submissive at his feet, with the tenderness\nof women won over by his gaiety and his goodness. Already he opened\nhis mouth, and was going to answer roughly, when the uselessness of\nthe discussion became apparent to him.",
        "“There! Let us have peace. I would do better to go and work. And above\nall, let no one interrupt me!”",
        "With hasty steps he gained his chamber, where he had installed a sort\nof laboratory, and shut himself up in it. The prohibition to enter it\nwas formal. It was here that he gave himself up to special\npreparations, of which he spoke to no one. Almost immediately the slow\nand regular sound of a pestle grinding in a mortar was heard.",
        "“Come,” said Clotilde, smiling, “there he is, at his devil’s cookery,\nas grandmother says.”",
        "And she tranquilly resumed her copying of the hollyhocks. She\ncompleted the drawing with mathematical precision, she found the exact\ntone of the violet petals, striped with yellow, even to the most\ndelicate discoloration of the shades.",
        "“Ah!” murmured Martine, after a moment, again seated on the ground,\nand occupied in mending the chair, “what a misfortune for a good man\nlike that to lose his soul wilfully. For there is no denying it; I\nhave known him now for thirty years, and in all that time he has never\nso much as spoken an unkind word to any one. A real heart of gold, who\nwould take the bit from his own mouth. And handsome, too, and always\nwell, and always gay, a real blessing! It is a murder that he does not\nwish to make his peace with the good God. We will force him to do it,\nmademoiselle, will we not?”",
        "Clotilde, surprised at hearing her speak so long at one time on the\nsubject, gave her word with a grave air.",
        "“Certainly, Martine, it is a promise. We will force him.”",
        "Silence reigned again, broken a moment afterward by the ringing of the\nbell attached to the street door below. It had been attached to the\ndoor so that they might have notice when any one entered the house,\ntoo vast for the three persons who inhabited it. The servant appeared\nsurprised, and grumbled a few words under her breath. Who could have\ncome in such heat as this? She rose, opened the door, and went and\nleaned over the balustrade; then she returned, saying:",
        "“It is Mme. Felicite.”",
        "Old Mme. Rougon entered briskly. In spite of her eighty years, she had\nmounted the stairs with the activity of a young girl; she was still\nthe brown, lean, shrill grasshopper of old. Dressed elegantly now in\nblack silk, she might still be taken, seen from behind, thanks to the\nslenderness of her figure, for some coquette, or some ambitious woman\nfollowing her favorite pursuit. Seen in front, her eyes still lighted\nup her withered visage with their fires, and she smiled with an\nengaging smile when she so desired.",
        "“What! is it you, grandmother?” cried Clotilde, going to meet her.\n“Why, this sun is enough to bake one.”",
        "Felicite, kissing her on the forehead, laughed, saying:",
        "“Oh, the sun is my friend!”",
        "Then, moving with short, quick steps, she crossed the room, and turned\nthe fastening of one of the shutters.",
        "“Open the shutters a little! It is too gloomy to live in the dark in\nthis way. At my house I let the sun come in.”",
        "Through the opening a jet of hot light, a flood of dancing sparks\nentered. And under the sky, of the violet blue of a conflagration, the\nparched plain could be seen, stretching away in the distance, as if\nasleep or dead in the overpowering, furnace-like heat, while to the\nright, above the pink roofs, rose the belfry of St. Saturnin, a gilded\ntower with arises that, in the blinding light, looked like whitened\nbones.",
        "“Yes,” continued Felicite, “I think of going shortly to the Tulettes,\nand I wished to know if Charles were here, to take him with me. He is\nnot here–I see that–I will take him another day.”",
        "But while she gave this pretext for her visit, her ferret-like eyes\nwere making the tour of the apartment. Besides, she did not insist,\nspeaking immediately afterward of her son Pascal, on hearing the\nrhythmical noise of the pestle, which had not ceased in the adjoining\nchamber.",
        "“Ah! he is still at his devil’s cookery! Don’t disturb him, I have\nnothing to say to him.”",
        "Martine, who had resumed her work on the chair, shook her head, as if\nto say that she had no mind to disturb her master, and there was\nsilence again, while Clotilde wiped her fingers, stained with crayon,\non a cloth, and Felicite began to walk about the room with short\nsteps, looking around inquisitively.",
        "Old Mme. Rougon would soon be two years a widow. Her husband who had\ngrown so corpulent that he could no longer move, had succumbed to an\nattack of indigestion on the 3d of September, 1870, on the night of\nthe day on which he had learned of the catastrophe of Sedan. The ruin\nof the government of which he flattered himself with being one of the\nfounders, seemed to have crushed him. Thus, Felicite affected to\noccupy herself no longer with politics, living, thenceforward, like a\ndethroned queen, the only surviving power of a vanished world. No one\nwas unaware that the Rougons, in 1851, had saved Plassans from\nanarchy, by causing the coup d’etat of the 2d of December to triumph\nthere, and that, a few years later, they had won it again from the\nlegitimist and republican candidates, to give it to a Bonapartist\ndeputy. Up to the time of the war, the Empire had continued\nall-powerful in the town, so popular that it had obtained there at the\nplebiscite an overwhelming majority. But since the disasters the town\nhad become republican, the quarter St. Marc had returned to its secret\nroyalist intrigues, while the old quarter and the new town had sent to\nthe chamber a liberal representative, slightly tinged with Orleanism,\nand ready to take sides with the republic, if it should triumph. And,\ntherefore, it was that Felicite, like the intelligent woman she was,\nhad withdrawn her attention from politics, and consented to be nothing\nmore than the dethroned queen of a fallen government.",
        "But this was still an exalted position, surrounded by a melancholy\npoetry. For sixteen years she had reigned. The tradition of her two\nsalons, the yellow salon, in which the coup d’etat had matured,\nand the green salon, later the neutral ground on which the conquest\nof Plassans was completed, embellished itself with the reflection of\nthe vanished past, and was for her a glorious history. And besides,\nshe was very rich. Then, too, she had shown herself dignified in her\nfall, never uttering a regret or a complaint, parading, with her\neighty years, so long a succession of fierce appetites, of abominable\nmaneuvers, of inordinate gratifications, that she became august\nthrough them. Her only happiness, now, was to enjoy in peace her large\nfortune and her past royalty, and she had but one passion left–to\ndefend her past, to extend its fame, suppressing everything that might\ntarnish it later. Her pride, which lived on the double exploit of\nwhich the inhabitants still spoke, watched with jealous care, resolved\nto leave in existence only creditable documents, those traditions\nwhich caused her to be saluted like a fallen queen when she walked\nthrough the town.",
        "She went to the door of the chamber and listened to the persistent\nnoise of the pestle, which did not cease. Then, with an anxious brow,\nshe returned to Clotilde.",
        "“Good Heavens! What is he making? You know that he is doing himself\nthe greatest harm with his new drug. I was told, the other day, that\nhe came near killing one of his patients.”",
        "“Oh, grandmother!” cried the young girl.",
        "But she was now launched.",
        "“Yes, exactly. The good wives say many other things, besides! Why, go\nquestion them, in the faubourg! They will tell you that he grinds dead\nmen’s bones in infants’ blood.”",
        "This time, while even Martine protested, Clotilde, wounded in her\naffection, grew angry.",
        "“Oh, grandmother, do not repeat such abominations! Master has so great\na heart that he thinks only of making every one happy!”",
        "Then, when she saw that they were both angry, Felicite, comprehending\nthat she had gone too far, resumed her coaxing manner.",
        "“But, my kitten, it is not I who say those frightful things. I repeat\nto you the stupid reports they spread, so that you may comprehend that\nPascal is wrong to pay no heed to public opinion. He thinks he has\nfound a new remedy–nothing could be better! and I will even admit\nthat he will be able to cure everybody, as he hopes. Only, why affect\nthese mysterious ways; why not speak of the matter openly; why, above\nall, try it only on the rabble of the old quarter and of the country,\ninstead of, attempting among the well-to-do people of the town,\nstriking cures which would do him honor? No, my child, you see your\nuncle has never been able to act like other people.”",
        "She had assumed a grieved tone, lowering her voice, to display the\nsecret wound of her heart.",
        "“God be thanked! it is not men of worth who are wanting in our family;\nmy other sons have given me satisfaction enough. Is it not so? Your\nUncle Eugene rose high enough, minister for twelve years, almost\nemperor! And your father himself handled many a million, and had a\npart in many a one of the great works which have made Paris a new\ncity. Not to speak at all of your brother, Maxime, so rich, so\ndistinguished, nor of your cousin, Octave Mouret, one of the kings of\nthe new commerce, nor of our dear Abbe Mouret, who is a saint! Well,\nthen, why does Pascal, who might have followed in the footsteps of\nthem all, persist in living in his hole, like an eccentric old fool?”",
        "And as the young girl was again going to protest, she closed her\nmouth, with a caressing gesture of her hand.",
        "“No, no, let me finish. I know very well that Pascal is not a fool,\nthat he has written remarkable works, that his communications to the\nAcademy of Medicine have even won for him a reputation among\nsavants. But what does that count for, compared to what I have\ndreamed of for him? Yes, all the best practice of the town, a large\nfortune, the decoration–honors, in short, and a position worthy of\nthe family. My word! I used to say to him when he was a child: ’But\nwhere do you come from? You are not one of us!’ As for me, I have\nsacrificed everything for the family; I would let myself be hacked to\npieces, that the family might always be great and glorious!”",
        "She straightened her small figure, she seemed to grow tall with the\none passion that had formed the joy and pride of her life. But as she\nresumed her walk, she was startled by suddenly perceiving on the floor\nthe copy of the Temps, which the doctor had thrown there, after\ncutting out the article, to add it to the Saccard papers, and the\nlight from the open window, falling full upon the sheet, enlightened\nher, no doubt, for she suddenly stopped walking, and threw herself\ninto a chair, as if she at last knew what she had come to learn.",
        "“Your father has been appointed editor of the Epoque,” she said\nabruptly.",
        "“Yes,” answered Clotilde tranquilly, “master told me so; it was in the\npaper.”",
        "With an anxious and attentive expression, Felicite looked at her, for\nthis appointment of Saccard, this rallying to the republic, was\nsomething of vast significance. After the fall of the empire he had\ndared return to France, notwithstanding his condemnation as director\nof the Banque Universelle, the colossal fall of which had preceded\nthat of the government. New influences, some incredible intrigue must\nhave placed him on his feet again, for not only had he received his\npardon, but he was once more in a position to undertake affairs of\nconsiderable importance, launched into journalism, having his share\nagain of all the good things going. And the recollection came to her\nof the quarrels of other days between him and his brother Eugene\nRougon, whom he had so often compromised, and whom, by an ironical\nturn of events, he was perhaps going to protect, now that the former\nminister of the Empire was only a simple deputy, resigned to the\nsingle role of standing by his fallen master with the obstinacy with\nwhich his mother stood by her family. She still obeyed docilely the\norders of her eldest son, the genius, fallen though he was; but\nSaccard, whatever he might do, had also a part in her heart, from his\nindomitable determination to succeed, and she was also proud of\nMaxime, Clotilde’s brother, who had taken up his quarters again, after\nthe war, in his mansion in the Avenue of the Bois de Boulogne, where\nhe was consuming the fortune left him by his wife, Louise de Mareuil,\nbecome prudent, with the wisdom of a man struck in a vital part, and\ntrying to cheat the paralysis which threatened him.",
        "“Editor of the Epoque,” she repeated; “it is really the position of\na minister which your father has won. And I forgot to tell you, I have\nwritten again to your brother, to persuade him to come and see us.\nThat would divert him, it would do him good. Then, there is that\nchild, that poor Charles–”",
        "She did not continue. This was another of the wounds from which her\npride bled; a son whom Maxime had had when seventeen by a servant, and\nwho now, at the age of fifteen, weak of intellect, a half-idiot, lived\nat Plassans, going from the house of one to that of another, a burden\nto all.",
        "She remained silent a moment longer, waiting for some remark from\nClotilde, some transition by which she might come to the subject she\nwished to touch upon. When she saw that the young girl, occupied in\narranging the papers on her desk, was no longer listening, she came to\na sudden decision, after casting a glance at Martine, who continued\nmending the chair, as if she were deaf and dumb.",
        "“Your uncle cut the article out of the Temps, then?”",
        "Clotilde smiled calmly.",
        "“Yes, master put it away among his papers. Ah! how many notes he\nburies in there! Births, deaths, the smallest event in life,\neverything goes in there. And the genealogical tree is there also, our\nfamous genealogical tree, which he keeps up to date!”",
        "The eyes of old Mme. Rougon flamed. She looked fixedly at the young\ngirl.",
        "“You know them, those papers?”",
        "“Oh, no, grandmother; master has never spoken to me of them; and he\nhas forbidden me to touch them.”",
        "But she did not believe her.",
        "“Come! you have them under your hands, you must have read them.”",
        "Very simple, with her calm rectitude, Clotilde answered, smilingly\nagain.",
        "“No, when master forbids me to do anything, it is because he has his\nreasons, and I do not do it.”",
        "“Well, my child,” cried Felicite vehemently, dominated by her passion,\n“you, whom Pascal loves tenderly, and whom he would listen to,\nperhaps, you ought to entreat him to burn all that, for if he should\nchance to die, and those frightful things which he has in there were\nto be found, we should all be dishonored!”",
        "Ah, those abominable papers! she saw them at night, in her nightmares,\nrevealing in letters of fire, the true histories, the physiological\nblemishes of the family, all that wrong side of her glory which she\nwould have wished to bury forever with the ancestors already dead! She\nknew how it was that the doctor had conceived the idea of collecting\nthese documents at the beginning of his great studies on heredity; how\nhe had found himself led to take his own family as an example, struck\nby the typical cases which he saw in it, and which helped to support\nlaws discovered by him. Was it not a perfectly natural field of\nobservation, close at hand and with which he was thoroughly familiar?\nAnd with the fine, careless justness of the scientist, he had been\naccumulating for the last thirty years the most private data,\ncollecting and classifying everything, raising this genealogical tree\nof the Rougon-Macquarts, of which the voluminous papers, crammed full\nof proofs, were only the commentary.",
        "“Ah, yes,” continued Mme. Rougon hotly, “to the fire, to the fire with\nall those papers that would tarnish our name!”",
        "And as the servant rose to leave the room, seeing the turn the\nconversation was taking, she stopped her by a quick gesture.",
        "“No, no, Martine; stay! You are not in the way, since you are now one\nof the family.”",
        "Then, in a hissing voice:",
        "“A collection of falsehoods, of gossip, all the lies that our enemies,\nenraged by our triumph, hurled against us in former days! Think a\nlittle of that, my child. Against all of us, against your father,\nagainst your mother, against your brother, all those horrors!”",
        "“But how do you know they are horrors, grandmother?”",
        "She was disconcerted for a moment.",
        "“Oh, well; I suspect it! Where is the family that has not had\nmisfortunes which might be injuriously interpreted? Thus, the mother\nof us all, that dear and venerable Aunt Dide, your great-grandmother,\nhas she not been for the past twenty-one years in the madhouse at the\nTulettes? If God has granted her the grace of allowing her to live to\nthe age of one hundred and four years, he has also cruelly afflicted\nher in depriving her of her reason. Certainly, there is no shame in\nthat; only, what exasperates me–what must not be–is that they should\nsay afterward that we are all mad. And, then, regarding your\ngrand-uncle Macquart, too, deplorable rumors have been spread. Macquart\nhad his faults in past days, I do not seek to defend him. But to-day, is\nhe not living very reputably on his little property at the Tulettes, two\nsteps away from our unhappy mother, over whom he watches like a good\nson? And listen! one last example. Your brother, Maxime, committed a\ngreat fault when he had by a servant that poor little Charles, and it is\ncertain, besides, that the unhappy child is of unsound mind. No matter.\nWill it please you if they tell you that your nephew is degenerate; that\nhe reproduces from four generations back, his great-great-grandmother\nthe dear woman to whom we sometimes take him, and with whom he likes so\nmuch to be? No! there is no longer any family possible, if people begin\nto lay bare everything–the nerves of this one, the muscles of that. It\nis enough to disgust one with living!”",
        "Clotilde, standing in her long black blouse, had listened to her\ngrandmother attentively. She had grown very serious; her arms hung by\nher sides, her eyes were fixed upon the ground. There was silence for\na moment; then she said slowly:",
        "“It is science, grandmother.”",
        "“Science!” cried Felicite, trotting about again. “A fine thing, their\nscience, that goes against all that is most sacred in the world! When\nthey shall have demolished everything they will have advanced greatly!\nThey kill respect, they kill the family, they kill the good God!”",
        "“Oh! don’t say that, madame!” interrupted Martine, in a grieved voice,\nher narrow devoutness wounded. “Do not say that M. Pascal kills the\ngood God!”",
        "“Yes, my poor girl, he kills him. And look you, it is a crime, from\nthe religious point of view, to let one’s self be damned in that way.\nYou do not love him, on my word of honor! No, you do not love him, you\ntwo who have the happiness of believing, since you do nothing to bring\nhim back to the right path. Ah! if I were in your place, I would split\nthat press open with a hatchet. I would make a famous bonfire with all\nthe insults to the good God which it contains!”",
        "She had planted herself before the immense press and was measuring it\nwith her fiery glance, as if to take it by assault, to sack it, to\ndestroy it, in spite of the withered and fragile thinness of her\neighty years. Then, with a gesture of ironical disdain:",
        "“If, even with his science, he could know everything!”",
        "Clotilde remained for a moment absorbed in thought, her gaze lost in\nvacancy. Then she said in an undertone, as if speaking to herself:",
        "“It is true, he cannot know everything. There is always something else\nbelow. That is what irritates me; that is what makes us quarrel: for I\ncannot, like him, put the mystery aside. I am troubled by it, so much\nso that I suffer cruelly. Below, what wills and acts in the shuddering\ndarkness, all the unknown forces–”",
        "Her voice had gradually become lower and now dropped to an indistinct\nmurmur.",
        "Then Martine, whose face for a moment past had worn a somber\nexpression, interrupted in her turn:",
        "“If it was true, however, mademoiselle, that monsieur would be damned\non account of those villainous papers, tell me, ought we to let it\nhappen? For my part, look you, if he were to tell me to throw myself\ndown from the terrace, I would shut my eyes and throw myself, because\nI know that he is always right. But for his salvation! Oh! if I could,\nI would work for that, in spite of him. In every way, yes! I would\nforce him; it is too cruel to me to think that he will not be in\nheaven with us.”",
        "“You are quite right, my girl,” said Felicite approvingly. “You, at\nleast, love your master in an intelligent fashion.”",
        "Between the two, Clotilde still seemed irresolute. In her, belief did\nnot bend to the strict rule of dogma; the religious sentiment did not\nmaterialize in the hope of a paradise, of a place of delights, where\nshe was to meet her own again. It was in her simply a need of a\nbeyond, a certainty that the vast world does not stop short at\nsensation, that there is a whole unknown world, besides, which must be\ntaken into account. But her grandmother, who was so old, this servant,\nwho was so devoted, shook her in her uneasy affection for her uncle.\nDid they not love him better, in a more enlightened and more upright\nfashion, they who desired him to be without a stain, freed from his\nmanias as a scientist, pure enough to be among the elect? Phrases of\ndevotional books recurred to her; the continual battle waged against\nthe spirit of evil; the glory of conversions effected after a violent\nstruggle. What if she set herself to this holy task; what if, after\nall, in spite of himself, she should be able to save him! And an\nexaltation gradually gained her spirit, naturally inclined to\nadventurous enterprises.",
        "“Certainly,” she said at last, “I should be very happy if he would not\npersist in his notion of heaping up all those scraps of paper, and if\nhe would come to church with us.”",
        "Seeing her about to yield, Mme. Rougon cried out that it was necessary\nto act, and Martine herself added the weight of all her real\nauthority. They both approached the young girl, and began to instruct\nher, lowering their voices as if they were engaged in a conspiracy,\nwhence was to result a miraculous benefit, a divine joy with which the\nwhole house would be perfumed. What a triumph if they reconciled the\ndoctor with God! and what sweetness, afterward, to live altogether in\nthe celestial communion of the same faith!",
        "“Well, then, what must I do?” asked Clotilde, vanquished, won over.",
        "But at this moment the doctor’s pestle was heard in the silence, with\nits continued rhythm. And the victorious Felicite, who was about to\nspeak, turned her head uneasily, and looked for a moment at the door\nof the adjoining chamber. Then, in an undertone, she said:",
        "“Do you know where the key of the press is?”",
        "Clotilde answered only with an artless gesture, that expressed all her\nrepugnance to betray her master in this way.",
        "“What a child you are! I swear to you that I will take nothing; I will\nnot even disturb anything. Only as we are alone and as Pascal never\nreappears before dinner, we might assure ourselves of what there is in\nthere, might we not? Oh! nothing but a glance, on my word of honor.”",
        "The young girl stood motionless, unwilling, still, to give her\nconsent.",
        "“And then, it may be that I am mistaken; no doubt there are none of\nthose bad things there that I have told you of.”",
        "This was decisive; she ran to take the key from the drawer, and she\nherself opened wide the press.",
        "“There, grandmother, the papers are up there.”",
        "Martine had gone, without a word, to station herself at the door of\nthe doctor’s chamber, her ear on the alert, listening to the pestle,\nwhile Felicite, as if riveted to the spot by emotion, regarded the\npapers. At last, there they were, those terrible documents, the\nnightmare that had poisoned her life! She saw them, she was going to\ntouch them, to carry them away! And she reached up, straining her\nlittle legs, in the eagerness of her desire.",
        "“It is too high, my kitten,” she said. “Help me; give them to me!”",
        "“Oh! not that, grandmother! Take a chair!”",
        "Felicite took a chair, and mounted slowly upon it. But she was still\ntoo short. By an extraordinary effort she raised herself, lengthening\nher stature until she was able to touch the envelopes of strong blue\npaper with the tips of her fingers; and her fingers traveled over\nthem, contracting nervously, scratching like claws. Suddenly there was\na crash–it was a geological specimen, a fragment of marble that had\nbeen on a lower shelf, and that she had just thrown down.",
        "Instantly the pestle stopped, and Martine said in a stifled voice:",
        "“Take care; here he comes!”",
        "But Felicite, grown desperate, did not hear, did not let go her hold\nwhen Pascal entered hastily. He had supposed that some accident had\nhappened, that some one had fallen, and he stood stupefied at what he\nsaw–his mother on the chair, her arm still in the air, while Martine\nhad withdrawn to one side, and Clotilde, very pale, stood waiting,\nwithout turning her head. When he comprehended the scene, he himself\nbecame as white as a sheet. A terrible anger arose within him.",
        "Old Mme. Rougon, however, troubled herself in no wise. When she saw\nthat the opportunity was lost, she descended from the chair, without\nmaking any illusion whatever to the task at which he had surprised\nher.",
        "“Oh, it is you! I do not wish to disturb you. I came to embrace\nClotilde. But here I have been talking for nearly two hours, and I\nmust run away at once. They will be expecting me at home; they won’t\nknow what has become of me at this hour. Good-by until Sunday.”",
        "She went away quite at her ease, after smiling at her son, who stood\nbefore her silent and respectful. It was an attitude that he had long\nsince adopted, to avoid an explanation which he felt must be cruel,\nand which he had always feared. He knew her, he was willing to pardon\nher everything, in his broad tolerance as a scientist, who made\nallowance for heredity, environment, and circumstances. And, then, was\nshe not his mother? That ought to have sufficed, for, in spite of the\nfrightful blows which his researches inflicted upon the family, he\npreserved a great affection for those belonging to him.",
        "When his mother was no longer there, his anger burst forth, and fell\nupon Clotilde. He had turned his eyes away from Martine, and fixed\nthem on the young girl, who did not turn hers away, however, with a\ncourage which accepted the responsibility of her act.",
        "“You! you!” he said at last.",
        "He seized her arm, and pressed it until she cried. But she continued\nto look him full in the face, without quailing before him, with the\nindomitable will of her individuality, of her selfhood. She was\nbeautiful and provoking, with her tall, slender figure, robed in its\nblack blouse; and her exquisite, youthful fairness, her straight\nforehead, her finely cut nose, her firm chin, took on something of a\nwarlike charm in her rebellion.",
        "“You, whom I have made, you who are my pupil, my friend, my other\nmind, to whom I have given a part of my heart and of my brain! Ah,\nyes! I should have kept you entirely for myself, and not have allowed\nyour stupid good God to take the best part of you!”",
        "“Oh, monsieur, you blaspheme!” cried Martine, who had approached him,\nin order to draw upon herself a part of his anger.",
        "But he did not even see her. Only Clotilde existed for him. And he was\nas if transfigured, stirred up by so great a passion that his handsome\nface, crowned by his white hair, framed by his white beard, flamed\nwith youthful passion, with an immense tenderness that had been\nwounded and exasperated.",
        "“You, you!” he repeated in a trembling voice.",
        "“Yes, I! Why then, master, should I not love you better than you love\nme? And why, if I believe you to be in peril, should I not try to save\nyou? You are greatly concerned about what I think; you would like well\nto make me think as you do!”",
        "She had never before defied him in this way.",
        "“But you are a little girl; you know nothing!”",
        "“No, I am a soul, and you know no more about souls than I do!”",
        "He released her arm, and waved his hand vaguely toward heaven, and\nthen a great silence fell–a silence full of grave meaning, of the\nuselessness of the discussion which he did not wish to enter upon.\nThrusting her aside rudely, he crossed over to the middle window and\nopened the blinds, for the sun was declining, and the room was growing\ndark. Then he returned.",
        "But she, feeling a need of air and space, went to the open window. The\nburning rain of sparks had ceased, and there fell now, from on high,\nonly the last shiver of the overheated and paling sky; and from the\nstill burning earth ascended warm odors, with the freer respiration of\nevening. At the foot of the terrace was the railroad, with the\noutlying dependencies of the station, of which the buildings were to\nbe seen in the distance; then, crossing the vast arid plain, a line of\ntrees marked the course of the Viorne, beyond which rose the hills of\nSainte-Marthe, red fields planted with olive trees, supported on\nterraces by walls of uncemented stones and crowned by somber pine\nwoods–broad amphitheaters, bare and desolate, corroded by the heats\nof summer, of the color of old baked brick, which this fringe of dark\nverdure, standing out against the background of the sky, bordered\nabove. To the left opened the gorges of the Seille, great yellow\nstones that had broken away from the soil, and lay in the midst of\nblood-colored fields, dominated by an immense band of rocks like the\nwall of a gigantic fortress; while to the right, at the very entrance\nto the valley through which flowed the Viorne, rose, one above\nanother, the discolored pink-tiled roofs of the town of Plassans, the\ncompact and confused mass of an old town, pierced by the tops of\nancient elms, and dominated by the high tower of St. Saturnin,\nsolitary and serene at this hour in the limpid gold of sunset.",
        "“Ah, my God!” said Clotilde slowly, “one must be arrogant, indeed, to\nimagine that one can take everything in one’s hand and know\neverything!”",
        "Pascal had just mounted on the chair to assure himself that not one of\nhis packages was missing. Then he took up the fragment of marble, and\nreplaced it on the shelf, and when he had again locked the press with\na vigorous turn of the hand, he put the key into his pocket.",
        "“Yes,” he replied; “try not to know everything, and above all, try not\nto bewilder your brain about what we do not know, what we shall\ndoubtless never know!”",
        "Martine again approached Clotilde, to lend her her support, to show\nher that they both had a common cause. And now the doctor perceived\nher, also, and felt that they were both united in the same desire for\nconquest. After years of secret attempts, it was at last open war; the\nsavant saw his household turn against his opinions, and menace them\nwith destruction. There is no worse torture than to have treason in\none’s own home, around one; to be trapped, dispossessed, crushed, by\nthose whom you love, and who love you!",
        "Suddenly this frightful idea presented itself to him.",
        "“And yet both of you love me!” he cried.",
        "He saw their eyes grow dim with tears; he was filled with an infinite\nsadness, on this tranquil close of a beautiful day. All his gaiety,\nall his kindness of heart, which came from his intense love of life,\nwere shaken by it.",
        "“Ah, my dear! and you, my poor girl,” he said, “you are doing this for\nmy happiness, are you not? But, alas, how unhappy we are going to be!”",
