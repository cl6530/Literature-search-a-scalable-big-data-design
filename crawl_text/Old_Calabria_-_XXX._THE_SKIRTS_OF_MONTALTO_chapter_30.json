        "After such sights of suffering humanity–back to the fields and\nmountains! Aspromonte, the wild region behind Reggio, was famous, not\nlong ago, for Garibaldi’s battle. But the exploits of this warrior have\nlately been eclipsed by those of the brigand Musolino, who infested the\ncountry up to a few years ago, defying the soldiery and police of all\nItaly. He would still be safe and unharmed had he remained in these\nfastnesses. But he wandered away, wishful to leave Italy for good and\nall, and was captured far from his home by some policemen who were\nlooking for another man, and who nearly fainted when he pronounced his\nname. After a sensational trial, they sentenced him to thirty odd years’\nimprisonment; he is now languishing in the fortress of Porto Longone on\nElba. Whoever has looked into this Spanish citadel will not envy him. Of\nthe lovely little bay, of the loadstone mountain, of the romantic\npathway to the hermitage of Monserrato or the glittering beach at\nRio–of all the charms of Porto Longone he knows nothing, despite a\nlengthy residence on the spot.",
        "They say he has grown consumptive and witless during the long solitary\nconfinement which preceded his present punishment–an eternal night in a\nnarrow cell. No wonder. I have seen the condemned on their release from\nthese boxes of masonry at the island of Santo Stefano: dazed shadows,\ntottering, with complexions the colour of parchment. These are the\nsurvivors. But no one asks after the many who die in these dungeons\nfrenzied, or from battering their heads against the wall; no one knows\ntheir number save the doctor and the governor, whose lips are sealed. . . .",
        "I decided upon a rear attack of Aspromonte. I would go by rail as far as\nBagnara on the Tyrrhenian, the station beyond Scylla of old renown; and\nthence afoot via Sant’ Eufemia [Footnote: Not to be confounded with the\nrailway station on the gulf of that name, near Maida.] to Sinopoli,\npushing on, if day permitted, as far as Delianuova, at the foot of\nthe mountain. Early next morning I would climb the summit and descend to\nthe shores of the Ionian, to Bova. It seemed a reasonable programme.",
        "All this Tyrrhenian coast-line is badly shattered; far more so than the\nsouthern shore. But the scenery is finer. There is nothing on that side\nto compare with the views from Nicastro, or Monte-leone, or Sant’ Elia\nnear Palmi. It is also more smiling, more fertile, and far less\nmalarious. Not that cultivation of the land implies absence of\nmalaria–nothing is a commoner mistake! The Ionian shore is not\nmalarious because it is desert–it is desert because malarious. The\nrichest tracts in Greece are known to be very dangerous, and it is the\nsame in Italy. Malaria and intensive agriculture go uncommonly well\ntogether. The miserable anopheles-mosquito loves the wells that are sunk\nfor the watering of the immense orange and lemon plantations in the\nReggio district; it displays a perverse predilection for the minute\npuddles left by the artificial irrigation of the fields that are covered\nwith fruit and vegetables. This artificial watering, in fact, seems to\nbe partly responsible for the spread of the disease. It is doubtful\nwhether the custom goes back into remote antiquity, for the climate used\nto be moister and could dispense with these practices. Certain products,\nonce grown in Calabria, no longer thrive there, on account of the\nincreased dryness and lack of rainfall.",
        "But there are some deadly regions, even along this Tyrrhenian shore.\nSuch is the plain of Maida, for instance, where stood not long ago the\nforest of Sant’ Eufemia, safe retreat of Parafante and other brigand\nheroes. The level lands of Rosarno and Gioia are equally ill-reputed. A\nFrench battalion stationed here in the summer of 1807 lost over sixty\nmen in fourteen days, besides leaving two hundred invalids in the\nhospital at Monteleone. Gioia is so malarious that in summer every one\nof the inhabitants who can afford the price of a ticket goes by the\nevening train to Palmato sleep there. You will do well, by the way, to\nsee something of the oil industry of Palmi, if time permits. In good\nyears, 200,000 quintals of olive oil are manufactured in the regions of\nwhich it is the commercial centre. Not long ago, before modern methods\nof refining were introduced, most of this oil was exported to Russia, to\nbe burned in holy lamps; nowadays it goes for the most part to Lucca, to\nbe adulterated for foreign markets (the celebrated Lucca oil, which the\nsimple Englishman regards as pure); only the finest quality is sent\nelsewhere, to Nice. From Gioia there runs a postal diligence once a day\nto Delianuova of which I might have availed myself, had I not preferred\nto traverse the country on foot.",
        "The journey from Reggio to Bagnara on this fair summer morning, along\nthe rippling Mediterranean, was short enough, but sufficiently long to\nlet me overhear the following conversation:",
        "A.–What a lovely sea! It is good, after all, to take three or four\nbaths a year. What think you?",
        "B.–I? No. For thirteen years I have taken no baths. But they are\nconsidered good for children.",
        "The calamities that Bagnara has suffered in the past have been so\nnumerous, so fierce and so varied that, properly speaking, the town has\nno right to exist any longer. It has enjoyed more than its full share of\nearthquakes, having been shaken to the ground over and over again. Sir\nWilliam Hamilton reports that 3017 persons were killed in that of 1783.\nThe horrors of war, too, have not spared it, and a certain modern\nexploit of the British arms here strikes me as so instructive that I\nwould gladly extract it from Grant’s “Adventures of an Aide-de-Camp,\"\nwere it not too long to transcribe, and far too good to abbreviate.",
        "A characteristic story, further, is told of the methods of General\nManhes at Bagnara. It may well be an exaggeration when they say that the\nentire road from Reggio to Naples was lined with the heads of\ndecapitated brigands; be that as it may, it stands to reason that\nBagnara, as befits an important place, was to be provided with an\n-appropriate display of these trophies. The heads were exhibited in\nbaskets, with strict injunctions to the authorities that they were not\nto be touched, seeing that they served not only for decorative but also\nmoral purposes–as examples. Imagine, therefore, the General’s feelings\non being told that one of these heads had been stolen; stolen, probably,\nby some pious relative of the deceased rascal, who wished to give the\nrelic a decent Christian burial.",
        "“That’s rather awkward,” he said, quietly musing. “But of course the\nspecimen must be replaced. Let me see. . . . Suppose we put the head of\nthe mayor of Bagnara into the vacant basket? Shall we? Yes, we’ll have\nthe mayor. It will make him more careful in future.” And within half an\nhour the basket was filled once more.",
        "There was a little hitch in starting from Bagnara. From the windings of\nthe carriage-road as portrayed by the map, I guessed that there must be\na number of short cuts into the uplands at the back of the town,\nundiscoverable to myself, which would greatly shorten the journey.\nBesides, there was my small bag to be carried. A porter familiar with\nthe tracks was plainly required, and soon enough I found a number of\nlusty youths leaning against a wall and doing nothing in particular.\nYes, they would accompany me, they said, the whole lot of them, just for\nthe fun of the thing.",
        "“And my bag?” I asked.",
        "“A bag to be carried? Then we must get a woman.”",
        "They unearthed a nondescript female who undertook to bear the burden as\nfar as Sinopoli for a reasonable consideration. So far good. But as we\nproceeded, the boys began to drop off, till only a single one was left.\nAnd then the woman suddenly vanished down a side street, declaring that\nshe must change her clothes. We waited for three-quarters of an hour, in\nthe glaring dust of the turnpike; she never emerged again, and the\nremaining boy stoutly refused to handle her load.",
        "“No,” he declared. “She must carry the bag. And I will keep you company.”",
        "The precious morning hours were wearing away, and here we stood idly by\nthe side of the road. It never struck me that the time might have been\nprofitably employed in paying a flying visit to one of the most sacred\nobjects in Calabria and possibly in the whole world, one which Signor N.\nMarcene describes as reposing at Bagnara in a rich reliquary–the\nauthentic Hat of the Mother of God. A lady tourist would not have missed\nthis chance of studying the fashions of those days. [Footnote: See next\nchapter.]",
        "Finally, in desperation, I snatched up the wretched luggage and poured\nmy griefs with unwonted eloquence into the ears of a man driving a\nbullock-cart down the road. So much was he moved, that he peremptorily\nordered his son to conduct me then and there to Sinopoli, to carry the\nbag, and claim one franc by way of payment. The little man tumbled off\nthe cart, rather reluctantly.",
        "“Away with you!” cried the stern parent, and we began the long march,\nclimbing uphill in the blazing sunshine; winding, later on, through\nshady chestnut woods and across broad tracts of cultivated land. It was\nplain that the task was beyond his powers, and when we had reached a\nspot where the strange-looking new village of Sant’ Eufemia was\nvisible–it is built entirely of wooden shelters; the stone town was\ngreatly shaken in the late earthquake–he was obliged to halt, and\nthenceforward stumbled slowly into the place. There he deposited the bag\non the ground, and faced me squarely.",
        "“No more of this!” he said, concentrating every ounce of his virility\ninto a look of uncompromising defiance.",
        "“Then I shall not pay you a single farthing, my son. And, moreover, I\nwill tell your father. You know what he commanded: to Sinopoli. This is\nonly Sant’ Eufemia. Unless-----”",
        "“You will tell my father? Unless-----?”",
        "“Unless you discover some one who will carry the bag not only to\nSinopoli, but as far as Delianuova.” I was not in the mood for repeating\nthe experiences of the morning.",
        "“It is difficult. But we will try.”",
        "He went in search, and returned anon with a slender lad of unusual\ncomeliness–an earthquake orphan. “This big one,” he explained, “walks\nwherever you please and carries whatever you give him. And you will pay\nhim nothing at all, unless he deserves it. Such is the arrangement. Are\nyou content?”",
        "“You have acted like a man.”",
        "The earthquake survivor set off at a swinging pace, and we soon reached\nSinopoli–new Sinopoli; the older settlement lies at a considerable\ndistance. Midday was past, and the long main street of the town–a\nformer fief of the terrible Ruffo family–stood deserted in the\ntrembling heat. None the less there was sufficient liveliness within the\nhouses; the whole place seemed in a state of jollification. It was\nSunday, the orphan explained; the country was duller than usual,\nhowever, because of the high price of wine. There had been no murders to\nspeak of–no, not for a long time past. But the vintage of this year, he\nadded, promises well, and life will soon become normal again.",
        "The mule track from here to Delianuova traverses some pretty scenery,\nboth wild and pastoral. But the personal graces of my companion made me\ntake small heed of the landscape. He was aglow with animal spirits, and\nhis conversation naively brilliant and of uncommon import. Understanding\nat a glance that he belonged to a type which is rather rare in Calabria,\nthat he was a classic (of a kind), I made every effort to be pleasant to\nhim; and I must have succeeded, for he was soon relating anecdotes which\nwould have been neither instructive, nor even intelligible, to the\njeune fille; all this, with angelic serenity of conscience.",
        "This radiantly-vicious child was the embodiment of the joy of life, the\nperfect immoralist. There was no cynicism in his nature, no cruelty, no\nobliquity, no remorse; nothing but sunshine with a few clouds sailing\nacross the fathomless blue spaces–the sky of Hellas. Nihil humani\nalienum; and as I listened to those glad tales, I marvelled at the\nmany-tinted experiences that could be crammed into seventeen short\nyears; what a document the ad-verttures of such a frolicsome demon would\nbe, what a feast for the initiated, could some one be induced to make\nthem known! But such things are hopelessly out of the question. And that\nis why so many of our wise people go into their graves without ever\nlearning what happens in this world.",
        "Among minor matters, he mentioned that he had already been three times\nto prison for “certain little affairs of blood,” while defending\n“certain friends.” Was it not dull, I asked, in prison? “The time passes\npleasantly anywhere,” he answered, “when you are young. I always make\nfriends, even in prison.” I could well believe it. His affinities were\nwith the blithe crew of the Liber Stratonis. He had a roving eye and the\nmouth of Antinous; and his morals were those of a condescending tiger-cub.",
        "Arriving at Delianuova after sunset, he conceived the project of\naccompanying me next morning up Montalto. I hesitated. In the first\nplace, I was going not only up that mountain, but to Bova on the distant\nIonian littoral-----",
        "“For my part,” he broke in, “ho pigliato confidenza. If you mistrust\nme, here! take my knife,” an ugly blade, pointed, and two inches in\nexcess of the police regulation length. This act of quasi-filial\nsubmission touched me; but it was not his knife I feared so much as that\nof “certain friends.” Some little difference of opinion might arise,\nsome question of money or other argument, and lo! the friends would be\nat hand (they always are), and one more stranger might disappear among\nthe clefts and gullies of Montalto. Aspromonte, the roughest corner of\nItaly, is no place for misunderstandings; the knife decides promptly who\nis right or wrong, and only two weeks ago I was warned not to cross the\ndistrict without a carbineer on either side of me.",
        "But to have clothed my thoughts in words during his gracious mood would\nhave been supremely unethical. I contented myself with the trite but\npregnant remark that things sometimes looked different in the morning,\nwhich provoked a pagan fit of laughter; farewelled him “with the\nMadonna!” and watched as he withdrew under the trees, lithe and buoyant,\nlike a flame that is swallowed up in the night.",
        "Only then did the real business begin. I should be sorry to say into how\nmany houses and wine-shops the obliging owner of the local inn conducted\nme, in search of a guide. We traversed all the lanes of this straggling\nand fairly prosperous place, and even those of its suburb Paracorio,\nevidently of Byzantine origin; the answer was everywhere the same: To\nMontalto, yes; to Bova, no! Night drew on apace and, as a last resource,\nhe led the way to the dwelling of a gentleman of the old school–a\nretired brigand, to wit, who, as I afterwards learned, had some ten or\ntwelve homicides to his account. Delianuova, and indeed the whole of\nAspromonte, has a bad reputation for crime.",
        "It was our last remaining chance.",
        "We found the patriarch sitting in a simple but tidy chamber, smoking his\npipe and playing with a baby; his daughter-in-law rose as we entered,\nand discreetly moved into an adjoining room. The cheery cut-throat put\nthe baby down to crawl on the floor, and his eyes sparkled when he heard\nof Bova.",
        "“Ah, one speaks of Bova!” he said. “A fine walk over the mountain!” He\nmuch regretted that he was too old for the trip, but so-and-so, he\nthought, might know something of the country. It pained him, too, that\nhe could not offer me a glass of wine. There was none in the house. In\nhis day, he added, it was not thought right to drink in the modern\nfashion; this wine-bibbing was responsible for considerable mischief; it\ntroubled the brain, driving men to do things they afterwards repented.\nHe drank only milk, having become accustomed to it during a long life\namong the hills. Milk cools the blood, he said, and steadies the hand,\nand keeps a man’s judgment undisturbed.",
        "The person he had named was found after some further search. He was a\nbronzed, clean-shaven type of about fifty, who began by refusing his\nservices point-blank, but soon relented, on hearing the ex-brigand’s\nrecommendation of his qualities.",
