        "Once upon a time there was a king who had a wife, whose name was\nSilver-tree, and a daughter, whose name was Gold-tree. On a certain\nday of the days, Gold-tree and Silver-tree went to a glen, where\nthere was a well, and in it there was a trout.",
        "Said Silver-tree, “Troutie, bonny little fellow, am not I the most\nbeautiful queen in the world?”",
        "“Oh! indeed you are not.”",
        "“Who then?”",
        "“Why, Gold-tree, your daughter.”",
        "Silver-tree went home, blind with rage. She lay down on the bed, and\nvowed she would never be well until she could get the heart and the\nliver of Gold-tree, her daughter, to eat.",
        "At nightfall the king came home, and it was told him that Silver-\ntree, his wife, was very ill. He went where she was, and asked her\nwhat was wrong with her.",
        "“Oh! only a thing–which you may heal if you like.”",
        "“Oh! indeed there is nothing at all which I could do for you that I\nwould not do.”",
        "“If I get the heart and the liver of Gold-tree, my daughter, to eat,\nI shall be well.”",
        "Now it happened about this time that the son of a great king had\ncome from abroad to ask Gold-tree for marrying. The king now agreed\nto this, and they went abroad.",
        "The king then went and sent his lads to the hunting-hill for a he-\ngoat, and he gave its heart and its liver to his wife to eat; and\nshe rose well and healthy.",
        "A year after this Silver-tree went to the glen, where there was the\nwell in which there was the trout.",
        "“Troutie, bonny little fellow,” said she, “am not I the most\nbeautiful queen in the world?”",
        "“Oh! indeed you are not.”",
        "“Who then?”",
        "“Why, Gold-tree, your daughter.”",
        "“Oh! well, it is long since she was living. It is a year since I ate\nher heart and liver.”",
        "“Oh! indeed she is not dead. She is married to a great prince\nabroad.”",
        "Silver-tree went home, and begged the king to put the long-ship in\norder, and said, “I am going to see my dear Gold-tree, for it is so\nlong since I saw her.” The long-ship was put in order, and they went\naway.",
        "It was Silver-tree herself that was at the helm, and she steered the\nship so well that they were not long at all before they arrived.",
        "The prince was out hunting on the hills. Gold-tree knew the long-\nship of her father coming.",
        "“Oh!” said she to the servants, “my mother is coming, and she will\nkill me.”",
        "“She shall not kill you at all; we will lock you in a room where she\ncannot get near you.”",
        "This is how it was done; and when Silver-tree came ashore, she began\nto cry out:",
        "“Come to meet your own mother, when she comes to see you,” Gold-tree\nsaid that she could not, that she was locked in the room, and that\nshe could not get out of it.",
        "“Will you not put out,” said Silver-tree, “your little finger\nthrough the key-hole, so that your own mother may give a kiss to\nit?”",
        "She put out her little finger, and Silver-tree went and put a\npoisoned stab in it, and Gold-tree fell dead.",
        "When the prince came home, and found Gold-tree dead, he was in great\nsorrow, and when he saw how beautiful she was, he did not bury her\nat all, but he locked her in a room where nobody would get near her.",
        "In the course of time he married again, and the whole house was\nunder the hand of this wife but one room, and he himself always kept\nthe key of that room. On a certain day of the days he forgot to take\nthe key with him, and the second wife got into the room. What did\nshe see there but the most beautiful woman that she ever saw.",
        "She began to turn and try to wake her, and she noticed the poisoned\nstab in her finger. She took the stab out, and Gold-tree rose alive,\nas beautiful as she was ever.",
        "At the fall of night the prince came home from the hunting-hill,\nlooking very downcast.",
        "“What gift,” said his wife, “would you give me that I could make you\nlaugh?”",
        "“Oh! indeed, nothing could make me laugh, except Gold-tree were to\ncome alive again.”",
        "“Well, you’ll find her alive down there in the room.”",
        "When the prince saw Gold-tree alive he made great rejoicings, and he\nbegan to kiss her, and kiss her, and kiss her. Said the second wife,\n“Since she is the first one you had it is better for you to stick to\nher, and I will go away.”",
        "“Oh! indeed you shall not go away, but I shall have both of you.”",
        "At the end of the year, Silver-tree went to the glen, where there\nwas the well, in which there was the trout.",
        "“Troutie, bonny little fellow,” said she, “am not I the most\nbeautiful queen in the world?”",
        "“Oh! indeed you are not.”",
        "“Who then?”",
        "“Why, Gold-tree, your daughter.”",
        "“Oh! well, she is not alive. It is a year since I put the poisoned\nstab into her finger.”",
        "“Oh! indeed she is not dead at all, at all.”",
        "Silver-tree, went home, and begged the king to put the long-ship in\norder, for that she was going to see her dear Gold-tree, as it was\nso long since she saw her. The long-ship was put in order, and they\nwent away. It was Silver-tree herself that was at the helm, and she\nsteered the ship so well that they were not long at all before they\narrived.",
        "The prince was out hunting on the hills. Gold-tree knew her father’s\nship coming.",
        "“Oh!” said she, “my mother is coming, and she will kill me.”",
        "“Not at all,” said the second wife; “we will go down to meet her.”",
        "Silver-tree came ashore. “Come down, Gold-tree, love,” said she,\n“for your own mother has come to you with a precious drink.”",
        "“It is a custom in this country,” said the second wife, “that the\nperson who offers a drink takes a draught out of it first.”",
        "Silver-tree put her mouth to it, and the second wife went and struck\nit so that some of it went down her throat, and she fell dead. They\nhad only to carry her home a dead corpse and bury her.",
        "The prince and his two wives were long alive after this, pleased and\npeaceful.",
        "I left them there.",
