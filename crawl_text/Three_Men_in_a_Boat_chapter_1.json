        "THREE INVALIDS. – SUFFERINGS OF GEORGE AND HARRIS. – A VICTIM TO ONE \nHUNDRED AND SEVEN FATAL MALADIES. – USEFUL PRESCRIPTIONS. – CURE FOR \nLIVER COMPLAINT IN CHILDREN. – WE AGREE THAT WE ARE OVERWORKED, AND NEED \nREST. – A WEEK ON THE ROLLING DEEP? – GEORGE SUGGESTS THE RIVER. – \nMONTMORENCY LODGES AN OBJECTION. – ORIGINAL MOTION CARRIED BY MAJORITY OF \nTHREE TO ONE.",
        "THERE were four of us – George, and William Samuel Harris, and myself, \nand Montmorency.  We were sitting in my room, smoking, and talking about \nhow bad we were – bad from a medical point of view I mean, of course.",
        "We were all feeling seedy, and we were getting quite nervous about it.  \nHarris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him at \ntimes, that he hardly knew what he was doing; and then George said that \nHE had fits of giddiness too, and hardly knew what HE was doing.  With \nme, it was my liver that was out of order.  I knew it was my liver that \nwas out of order, because I had just been reading a patent liver-pill \ncircular, in which were detailed the various symptoms by which a man \ncould tell when his liver was out of order.  I had them all.",
        "It is a most extraordinary thing, but I never read a patent medicine \nadvertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that I am \nsuffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most \nvirulent form.  The diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly \nwith all the sensations that I have ever felt.",
        "I remember going to the British Museum one day to read up the treatment \nfor some slight ailment of which I had a touch – hay fever, I fancy it \nwas.  I got down the book, and read all I came to read; and then, in an \nunthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently \nstudy diseases, generally.  I forget which was the first distemper I \nplunged into – some fearful, devastating scourge, I know – and, before I \nhad glanced half down the list of “premonitory symptoms,” it was borne in \nupon me that I had fairly got it.",
        "I sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of \ndespair, I again turned over the pages.  I came to typhoid fever – read \nthe symptoms – discovered that I had typhoid fever, must have had it for \nmonths without knowing it – wondered what else I had got; turned up St. \nVitus’s Dance – found, as I expected, that I had that too, – began to get \ninterested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so \nstarted alphabetically – read up ague, and learnt that I was sickening \nfor it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another \nfortnight.  Bright’s disease, I was relieved to find, I had only in a \nmodified form, and, so far as that was concerned, I might live for years.  \nCholera I had, with severe complications; and diphtheria I seemed to have \nbeen born with.  I plodded conscientiously through the twenty-six \nletters, and the only malady I could conclude I had not got was \nhousemaid’s knee.",
        "I felt rather hurt about this at first; it seemed somehow to be a sort of \nslight.  Why hadn’t I got housemaid’s knee?  Why this invidious \nreservation? After a while, however, less grasping feelings prevailed.  I \nreflected that I had every other known malady in the pharmacology, and I \ngrew less selfish, and determined to do without housemaid’s knee.  Gout, \nin its most malignant stage, it would appear, had seized me without my \nbeing aware of it; and zymosis I had evidently been suffering with from \nboyhood.  There were no more diseases after zymosis, so I concluded there \nwas nothing else the matter with me.",
        "I sat and pondered.  I thought what an interesting case I must be from a \nmedical point of view, what an acquisition I should be to a class!  \nStudents would have no need to “walk the hospitals,” if they had me.  I \nwas a hospital in myself.  All they need do would be to walk round me, \nand, after that, take their diploma.",
        "Then I wondered how long I had to live.  I tried to examine myself.  I \nfelt my pulse.  I could not at first feel any pulse at all.  Then, all of \na sudden, it seemed to start off.  I pulled out my watch and timed it.  I \nmade it a hundred and forty-seven to the minute.  I tried to feel my \nheart.  I could not feel my heart.  It had stopped beating.  I have since \nbeen induced to come to the opinion that it must have been there all the \ntime, and must have been beating, but I cannot account for it.  I patted \nmyself all over my front, from what I call my waist up to my head, and I \nwent a bit round each side, and a little way up the back.  But I could \nnot feel or hear anything.  I tried to look at my tongue.  I stuck it out \nas far as ever it would go, and I shut one eye, and tried to examine it \nwith the other.  I could only see the tip, and the only thing that I \ncould gain from that was to feel more certain than before that I had \nscarlet fever.",
        "I had walked into that reading-room a happy, healthy man.  I crawled out \na decrepit wreck.",
        "I went to my medical man.  He is an old chum of mine, and feels my pulse, \nand looks at my tongue, and talks about the weather, all for nothing, \nwhen I fancy I’m ill; so I thought I would do him a good turn by going to \nhim now.  “What a doctor wants,” I said, “is practice.  He shall have me.  \nHe will get more practice out of me than out of seventeen hundred of your \nordinary, commonplace patients, with only one or two diseases each.”  So \nI went straight up and saw him, and he said:",
        "“Well, what’s the matter with you?”",
        "I said:",
        "“I will not take up your time, dear boy, with telling you what is the \nmatter with me.  Life is brief, and you might pass away before I had \nfinished.  But I will tell you what is NOT the matter with me.  I have \nnot got housemaid’s knee.  Why I have not got housemaid’s knee, I cannot \ntell you; but the fact remains that I have not got it.  Everything else, \nhowever, I HAVE got.”",
        "And I told him how I came to discover it all.",
        "Then he opened me and looked down me, and clutched hold of my wrist, and \nthen he hit me over the chest when I wasn’t expecting it – a cowardly \nthing to do, I call it – and immediately afterwards butted me with the \nside of his head.  After that, he sat down and wrote out a prescription, \nand folded it up and gave it me, and I put it in my pocket and went out.",
        "I did not open it.  I took it to the nearest chemist’s, and handed it in.  \nThe man read it, and then handed it back.",
        "He said he didn’t keep it.",
        "I said:",
        "“You are a chemist?”",
        "He said:",
        "“I am a chemist.  If I was a co-operative stores and family hotel \ncombined, I might be able to oblige you.  Being only a chemist hampers \nme.”",
        "I read the prescription.  It ran:",
        "“1 lb. beefsteak, with\n 1 pt. bitter beer\nevery 6 hours.\n1 ten-mile walk every morning.\n1 bed at 11 sharp every night.\nAnd don’t stuff up your head with things you don’t understand.”",
        "I followed the directions, with the happy result – speaking for myself – \nthat my life was preserved, and is still going on.",
        "In the present instance, going back to the liver-pill circular, I had the \nsymptoms, beyond all mistake, the chief among them being “a general \ndisinclination to work of any kind.”",
        "What I suffer in that way no tongue can tell.  From my earliest infancy I \nhave been a martyr to it.  As a boy, the disease hardly ever left me for \na day.  They did not know, then, that it was my liver.  Medical science \nwas in a far less advanced state than now, and they used to put it down \nto laziness.",
        "“Why, you skulking little devil, you,” they would say, “get up and do \nsomething for your living, can’t you?” – not knowing, of course, that I \nwas ill.",
        "And they didn’t give me pills; they gave me clumps on the side of the \nhead.  And, strange as it may appear, those clumps on the head often \ncured me – for the time being.  I have known one clump on the head have \nmore effect upon my liver, and make me feel more anxious to go straight \naway then and there, and do what was wanted to be done, without further \nloss of time, than a whole box of pills does now.",
        "You know, it often is so – those simple, old-fashioned remedies are \nsometimes more efficacious than all the dispensary stuff.",
        "We sat there for half-an-hour, describing to each other our maladies.  I \nexplained to George and William Harris how I felt when I got up in the \nmorning, and William Harris told us how he felt when he went to bed; and \nGeorge stood on the hearth-rug, and gave us a clever and powerful piece \nof acting, illustrative of how he felt in the night.",
        "George FANCIES he is ill; but there’s never anything really the matter \nwith him, you know.",
        "At this point, Mrs. Poppets knocked at the door to know if we were ready \nfor supper.  We smiled sadly at one another, and said we supposed we had \nbetter try to swallow a bit.  Harris said a little something in one’s \nstomach often kept the disease in check; and Mrs. Poppets brought the \ntray in, and we drew up to the table, and toyed with a little steak and \nonions, and some rhubarb tart.",
        "I must have been very weak at the time; because I know, after the first \nhalf-hour or so, I seemed to take no interest whatever in my food – an \nunusual thing for me – and I didn’t want any cheese.",
        "This duty done, we refilled our glasses, lit our pipes, and resumed the \ndiscussion upon our state of health.  What it was that was actually the \nmatter with us, we none of us could be sure of; but the unanimous opinion \nwas that it – whatever it was – had been brought on by overwork.",
        "“What we want is rest,” said Harris.",
        "“Rest and a complete change,” said George.  “The overstrain upon our \nbrains has produced a general depression throughout the system.  Change \nof scene, and absence of the necessity for thought, will restore the \nmental equilibrium.”",
        "George has a cousin, who is usually described in the charge-sheet as a \nmedical student, so that he naturally has a somewhat family-physicianary \nway of putting things.",
        "I agreed with George, and suggested that we should seek out some retired \nand old-world spot, far from the madding crowd, and dream away a sunny \nweek among its drowsy lanes – some half-forgotten nook, hidden away by \nthe fairies, out of reach of the noisy world – some quaint-perched eyrie \non the cliffs of Time, from whence the surging waves of the nineteenth \ncentury would sound far-off and faint.",
        "Harris said he thought it would be humpy.  He said he knew the sort of \nplace I meant; where everybody went to bed at eight o’clock, and you \ncouldn’t get a REFEREE for love or money, and had to walk ten miles to \nget your baccy.",
        "“No,” said Harris, “if you want rest and change, you can’t beat a sea \ntrip.”",
        "I objected to the sea trip strongly.  A sea trip does you good when you \nare going to have a couple of months of it, but, for a week, it is \nwicked.",
        "You start on Monday with the idea implanted in your bosom that you are \ngoing to enjoy yourself.  You wave an airy adieu to the boys on shore, \nlight your biggest pipe, and swagger about the deck as if you were \nCaptain Cook, Sir Francis Drake, and Christopher Columbus all rolled into \none.  On Tuesday, you wish you hadn’t come.  On Wednesday, Thursday, and \nFriday, you wish you were dead.  On Saturday, you are able to swallow a \nlittle beef tea, and to sit up on deck, and answer with a wan, sweet \nsmile when kind-hearted people ask you how you feel now.  On Sunday, you \nbegin to walk about again, and take solid food.  And on Monday morning, \nas, with your bag and umbrella in your hand, you stand by the gunwale, \nwaiting to step ashore, you begin to thoroughly like it.",
        "I remember my brother-in-law going for a short sea trip once, for the \nbenefit of his health.  He took a return berth from London to Liverpool; \nand when he got to Liverpool, the only thing he was anxious about was to \nsell that return ticket.",
        "It was offered round the town at a tremendous reduction, so I am told; \nand was eventually sold for eighteenpence to a bilious-looking youth who \nhad just been advised by his medical men to go to the sea-side, and take \nexercise.",
        "“Sea-side!” said my brother-in-law, pressing the ticket affectionately \ninto his hand; “why, you’ll have enough to last you a lifetime; and as \nfor exercise! why, you’ll get more exercise, sitting down on that ship, \nthan you would turning somersaults on dry land.”",
        "He himself – my brother-in-law – came back by train.  He said the North-\nWestern Railway was healthy enough for him.",
        "Another fellow I knew went for a week’s voyage round the coast, and, \nbefore they started, the steward came to him to ask whether he would pay \nfor each meal as he had it, or arrange beforehand for the whole series.",
        "The steward recommended the latter course, as it would come so much \ncheaper.  He said they would do him for the whole week at two pounds \nfive.  He said for breakfast there would be fish, followed by a grill.  \nLunch was at one, and consisted of four courses.  Dinner at six – soup, \nfish, entree, joint, poultry, salad, sweets, cheese, and dessert.  And a \nlight meat supper at ten.",
        "My friend thought he would close on the two-pound-five job (he is a \nhearty eater), and did so.",
        "Lunch came just as they were off Sheerness.  He didn’t feel so hungry as \nhe thought he should, and so contented himself with a bit of boiled beef, \nand some strawberries and cream.  He pondered a good deal during the \nafternoon, and at one time it seemed to him that he had been eating \nnothing but boiled beef for weeks, and at other times it seemed that he \nmust have been living on strawberries and cream for years.",
        "Neither the beef nor the strawberries and cream seemed happy, either – \nseemed discontented like.",
        "At six, they came and told him dinner was ready.  The announcement \naroused no enthusiasm within him, but he felt that there was some of that \ntwo-pound-five to be worked off, and he held on to ropes and things and \nwent down.  A pleasant odour of onions and hot ham, mingled with fried \nfish and greens, greeted him at the bottom of the ladder; and then the \nsteward came up with an oily smile, and said:",
        "“What can I get you, sir?”",
        "“Get me out of this,” was the feeble reply.",
        "And they ran him up quick, and propped him up, over to leeward, and left \nhim.",
        "For the next four days he lived a simple and blameless life on thin \ncaptain’s biscuits (I mean that the biscuits were thin, not the captain) \nand soda-water; but, towards Saturday, he got uppish, and went in for \nweak tea and dry toast, and on Monday he was gorging himself on chicken \nbroth.  He left the ship on Tuesday, and as it steamed away from the \nlanding-stage he gazed after it regretfully.",
        "“There she goes,” he said, “there she goes, with two pounds’ worth of \nfood on board that belongs to me, and that I haven’t had.”",
        "He said that if they had given him another day he thought he could have \nput it straight.",
        "So I set my face against the sea trip.  Not, as I explained, upon my own \naccount.  I was never queer.  But I was afraid for George.  George said \nhe should be all right, and would rather like it, but he would advise \nHarris and me not to think of it, as he felt sure we should both be ill.  \nHarris said that, to himself, it was always a mystery how people managed \nto get sick at sea – said he thought people must do it on purpose, from \naffectation – said he had often wished to be, but had never been able.",
        "Then he told us anecdotes of how he had gone across the Channel when it \nwas so rough that the passengers had to be tied into their berths, and he \nand the captain were the only two living souls on board who were not ill.  \nSometimes it was he and the second mate who were not ill; but it was \ngenerally he and one other man.  If not he and another man, then it was \nhe by himself.",
        "It is a curious fact, but nobody ever is sea-sick – on land.  At sea, you \ncome across plenty of people very bad indeed, whole boat-loads of them; \nbut I never met a man yet, on land, who had ever known at all what it was \nto be sea-sick.  Where the thousands upon thousands of bad sailors that \nswarm in every ship hide themselves when they are on land is a mystery.",
        "If most men were like a fellow I saw on the Yarmouth boat one day, I \ncould account for the seeming enigma easily enough.  It was just off \nSouthend Pier, I recollect, and he was leaning out through one of the \nport-holes in a very dangerous position.  I went up to him to try and \nsave him.",
        "“Hi! come further in,” I said, shaking him by the shoulder.  “You’ll be \noverboard.”",
        "“Oh my!  I wish I was,” was the only answer I could get; and there I had \nto leave him.",
        "Three weeks afterwards, I met him in the coffee-room of a Bath hotel, \ntalking about his voyages, and explaining, with enthusiasm, how he loved \nthe sea.",
        "“Good sailor!” he replied in answer to a mild young man’s envious query; \n“well, I did feel a little queer ONCE, I confess.  It was off Cape Horn.  \nThe vessel was wrecked the next morning.”",
        "I said:",
        "“Weren’t you a little shaky by Southend Pier one day, and wanted to be \nthrown overboard?”",
        "“Southend Pier!” he replied, with a puzzled expression.",
        "“Yes; going down to Yarmouth, last Friday three weeks.”",
        "“Oh, ah – yes,” he answered, brightening up; “I remember now.  I did have \na headache that afternoon.  It was the pickles, you know.  They were the \nmost disgraceful pickles I ever tasted in a respectable boat.  Did you \nhave any?”",
        "For myself, I have discovered an excellent preventive against sea-\nsickness, in balancing myself.  You stand in the centre of the deck, and, \nas the ship heaves and pitches, you move your body about, so as to keep \nit always straight.  When the front of the ship rises, you lean forward, \ntill the deck almost touches your nose; and when its back end gets up, \nyou lean backwards.  This is all very well for an hour or two; but you \ncan’t balance yourself for a week.",
        "George said:",
        "“Let’s go up the river.”",
        "He said we should have fresh air, exercise and quiet; the constant change \nof scene would occupy our minds (including what there was of Harris’s); \nand the hard work would give us a good appetite, and make us sleep well.",
        "Harris said he didn’t think George ought to do anything that would have a \ntendency to make him sleepier than he always was, as it might be \ndangerous.",
        "He said he didn’t very well understand how George was going to sleep any \nmore than he did now, seeing that there were only twenty-four hours in \neach day, summer and winter alike; but thought that if he DID sleep any \nmore, he might just as well be dead, and so save his board and lodging.",
        "Harris said, however, that the river would suit him to a “T.”  I don’t \nknow what a “T” is (except a sixpenny one, which includes bread-and-\nbutter and cake AD LIB., and is cheap at the price, if you haven’t had \nany dinner).  It seems to suit everybody, however, which is greatly to \nits credit.",
        "It suited me to a “T” too, and Harris and I both said it was a good idea \nof George’s; and we said it in a tone that seemed to somehow imply that \nwe were surprised that George should have come out so sensible.",
        "The only one who was not struck with the suggestion was Montmorency.  He \nnever did care for the river, did Montmorency.",
        "“It’s all very well for you fellows,” he says; “you like it, but I don’t.  \nThere’s nothing for me to do.  Scenery is not in my line, and I don’t \nsmoke.  If I see a rat, you won’t stop; and if I go to sleep, you get \nfooling about with the boat, and slop me overboard.  If you ask me, I \ncall the whole thing bally foolishness.”",
        "We were three to one, however, and the motion was carried.",
