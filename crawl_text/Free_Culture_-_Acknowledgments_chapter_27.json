        "This book is the product of a long and as yet unsuccessful struggle that began \nwhen I read of Eric Eldred’s war to keep books free. Eldred’s work helped launch \na movement, the free culture movement, and it is to him that this book is \ndedicated.\nI received guidance in various places from friends and academics, including \nGlenn Brown, Peter DiCola, Jennifer Mnookin, Richard Posner, Mark Rose, and \nKathleen Sullivan. And I received correction and guidance from many amazing \nstudents at Stanford Law School and Stanford University. They included Andrew B. \nCoan, John Eden, James P. Fellers, Christopher Guzelian, Erica Goldberg, Robert \nHall- man, Andrew Harris, Matthew Kahn, Brian Link, Ohad Mayblum, Alina Ng, and \nErica Platt. I am particularly grateful to Catherine Crump and Harry Surden, who \nhelped direct their research, and to Laura Lynch, who brilliantly managed the \narmy that they assembled, and provided her own critical eye on much of this.\nYuko Noguchi helped me to understand the laws of Japan as well as its culture. I \nam thankful to her, and to the many in Japan who helped me prepare this book: \nJoi Ito, Takayuki Matsutani, Naoto Misaki, Michihiro Sasaki, Hiromichi Tanaka, \nHiroo Yamagata, and Yoshihiro Yonezawa. I am thankful as well as to Professor \nNobuhiro Nakayama, and the Tokyo University Business Law Center, for giving me \nthe chance to spend time in Japan, and to Tadashi Shiraishi and Kiyokazu \nYamagami for their generous help while I was there.\nThese are the traditional sorts of help that academics regularly draw upon. But \nin addition to them, the Internet has made it possible to receive advice and \ncorrection from many whom I have never even met. Among those who have responded \nwith extremely helpful advice to requests on my blog about the book are Dr. \nMohammad Al-Ubaydli, David Gerstein, and Peter DiMauro, as well as a long list \nof those who had specific ideas about ways to develop my argument. They included \nRichard Bondi, Steven Cherry, David Coe, Nik Cubrilovic, Bob Devine, Charles \nEicher, Thomas Guida, Elihu M. Gerson, Jeremy Hunsinger, Vaughn Iverson, John \nKarabaic, Jeff Keltner, James Lindenschmidt, K. L. Mann, Mark Manning, Nora \nMcCauley, Jeffrey McHugh, Evan McMullen, Fred Norton, John Pormann, Pedro A. D. \nRezende, Shabbir Safdar, Saul Schleimer, Clay Shirky, Adam Shostack, Kragen \nSitaker, Chris Smith, Bruce Steinberg, Andrzej Jan Taramina, Sean Walsh, Matt \nWasserman, Miljenko Williams, Wink, Roger Wood, Ximmbo da Jazz, and Richard \nYanco. (I apologize if I have missed anyone; with computers come glitches, and a \ncrash of my e-mail system meant I lost a bunch of great replies.)\nRichard Stallman and Michael Carroll each read the whole book in draft, and each \nprovided extremely helpful correction and advice. Michael helped me to see more \nclearly the significance of the regulation of derivitive works. And Richard \ncorrected an embarrassingly large number of errors. While my work is in part \ninspired by Stallman’s, he does not agree with me in important places throughout \nthis book.\nFinally, and forever, I am thankful to Bettina, who has always insisted that \nthere would be unending happiness away from these battles, and who has always \nbeen right. This slow learner is, as ever, grateful for her perpetual patience \nand love.",
