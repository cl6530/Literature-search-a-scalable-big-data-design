        "In Asia there lived a king who had two children, a boy and a girl. The\nboy’s name was Cadmus, and the girl’s name was Europa. The king’s\ncountry was a very small one. He could stand on his house top and see\nthe whole of it. On one side of it there were mountains, and on the\nother side was the sea. The king thought that it was the center of the\nworld, and he did not know much about other lands and people.",
        "Yet he was very happy in his own little kingdom, and very fond of his\nchildren. And he had good reason to be proud of them; for Cadmus grew up\nto be the bravest young man in the land, and Europa to be the fairest\nmaiden that had ever been seen. But sad days came to them all at last.",
        "One morning Europa went out into a field near the seashore to pick\nflowers. Her father’s cattle were in the field, grazing among the sweet\nclover. They were all very tame, and Europa knew every one of them by\nname. The herdsman was lying in the shade under a tree, trying to make\nmusic on a little flute of straw. Europa had played in the field a\nthousand times before, and no one had ever thought of any harm befalling\nher.",
        "That morning she noticed that there was a strange bull with the herd. He\nwas very large and as white as snow; and he had soft brown eyes which\nsomehow made him look very gentle and kind. At first he did not even\nlook at Europa, but went here and there, eating the tender grass which\ngrew among the clover. But when she had gathered her apron full of\ndaisies and buttercups, he came slowly towards her. She was not at all\nafraid of him; and so she stopped to look at him, he was so handsome. He\ncame close to her, and rubbed her arm with his nose to say\n“Good-morning!”",
        "She stroked his head and neck, and he seemed much pleased. Then she made\na wreath of daisies, and hung it round his neck. He looked at her with\nhis soft kind eyes, and seemed to thank her; and in a little while, he\nlay down among the clover. Europa then made a smaller wreath, and\nclimbed upon his back to twine it round his horns. But all at once he\nsprang up, and ran away so swiftly that Europa could not help herself.\nShe did not dare to jump off while he was going so fast, and all that\nshe could think to do was to hold fast to his neck and scream very\nloud.",
        "The herdsman under the tree heard her scream, and jumped up to see what\nwas the matter. He saw the bull running with her towards the shore. He\nran after them as fast as he could, but it was of no use. The bull\nleaped into the sea, and swam swiftly away, with poor Europa on his\nback. Several other people had seen him, and now they ran to tell the\nking. Soon the whole town was alarmed. Everybody ran out to the shore\nand looked. All that could be seen was something white moving very fast\nover the calm, blue water; and soon it was out of sight.",
        "The king sent out his fastest ship to try to overtake the bull. The\nsailors rowed far out to sea, much farther than any ship had ever gone\nbefore; but no trace of Europa could be found. When they came back,\neverybody felt that there was no more hope. All the women and children\nin the town wept for the lost Europa. The king shut himself up in his\nhouse, and did not eat nor drink for three days. Then he called his son\nCadmus, and bade him take a ship and go in search of his sister; and he\ntold him that, no matter what dangers might be in his way, he must not\ncome back until she was found.",
        "Cadmus was glad to go. He chose twenty brave young men to go with him,\nand set sail the very next day. It was a great undertaking; for they\nwere to pass through an unknown sea, and they did not know what lands\nthey would come to. Indeed, it was feared that they would never come to\nany land at all. Ships did not dare to go far from the shore in those\ndays. But Cadmus and his friends were not afraid. They were ready to\nface any danger.",
        "In a few days they came to a large island called Cyprus. Cadmus went on\nshore, and tried to talk with the strange people who lived there. They\nwere very kind to him, but they did not understand his language. At last\nhe made out by signs to tell them who he was, and to ask them if they\nhad seen his little sister Europa or the white bull that had carried her\naway. They shook their heads and pointed to the west.",
        "Then the young men sailed on in their little ship. They came to many\nislands, and stopped at every one, to see if they could find any trace\nof Europa; but they heard no news of her at all. At last, they came to\nthe country which we now call Greece. It was a new country then, and\nonly a few people lived there, and Cadmus soon learned to speak their\nlanguage well. For a long time he wandered from one little town to\nanother, always telling the story of his lost sister.",
        "One day an old man told Cadmus that if he would go to Delphi and ask the\nPythia, perhaps she could tell him all about Europa. Cadmus had never\nheard of Delphi or of the Pythia, and he asked the old man what he\nmeant.",
        "“I will tell you,” said the man. “Delphi is a town, built near the foot\nof Mount Parnassus, at the very center of the earth. It is the town of\nApollo, the Bringer of Light; and there is a temple there, built close\nto the spot where Apollo killed a black serpent, many, many years ago.\nThe temple is the most wonderful place in the world. In the middle of\nthe floor there is a wide crack, or crevice; and this crevice goes down,\ndown into the rock, nobody knows how deep. A strange odor comes up out\nof the crevice; and if any one breathes much of it, he is apt to fall\nover and lose his senses.”",
        "“But who is the Pythia that you spoke about?” asked Cadmus.",
        "“I will tell you,” said the old man. “The Pythia is a wise woman, who\nlives in the temple. When anybody asks her a hard question, she takes a\nthree-legged stool, called a tripod, and sets it over the crevice in\nthe floor. Then she sits on the stool and breathes the strange odor; and\ninstead of losing her senses as other people would do, she talks with\nApollo; and Apollo tells her how to answer the question. Men from all\nparts of the world go there to ask about things which they would like to\nknow. The temple is full of the beautiful and costly gifts which they\nhave brought for the Pythia. Sometimes she answers them plainly, and\nsometimes she answers them in riddles; but what she says always comes\ntrue.”",
        "So Cadmus went to Delphi to ask the Pythia about his lost sister. The\nwise woman was very kind to him; and when he had given her a beautiful\ngolden cup to pay her for her trouble, she sat down on the tripod and\nbreathed the strange odor which came up through the crevice in the rock.\nThen her face grew pale, and her eyes looked wild, and she seemed to be\nin great pain; but they said that she was talking with Apollo. Cadmus\nasked her to tell him what had become of Europa. She said that Jupiter,\nin the form of a white bull, had carried her away, and that it would be\nof no use to look for her any more.",
        "“But what shall I do?” said Cadmus. “My father told me not to turn back\ntill I should find her.”",
        "“Your father is dead,” said the Pythia, “and a strange king rules in\nhis place. You must stay in Greece, for there is work here for you to\ndo.”",
        "“What must I do?” said Cadmus.",
        "“Follow the white cow,” said the Pythia; “and on the hill where she lies\ndown, you must build a city.”",
        "Cadmus did not understand what she meant by this; but she would not\nspeak another word.",
        "“This must be one of her riddles,” he said, and he left the temple.",
        "When Cadmus went out of the temple, he saw a snow-white cow standing not\nfar from the door. She seemed to be waiting for him, for she looked at\nhim with her large brown eyes, and then turned and walked away. Cadmus\nthought of what the Pythia had just told him, and so he followed her.\nAll day and all night he walked through a strange wild country where no\none lived; and two of the young men who had sailed with Cadmus from his\nold home were with him.",
        "When the sun rose the next morning, they saw that they were on the top\nof a beautiful hill, with woods on one side and a grassy meadow on the\nother. There the cow lay down.",
        "“Here we will build our city,” said Cadmus.",
        "Then the young men made a fire of dry sticks, and Cadmus killed the cow.\nThey thought that if they should burn some of her flesh, the smell of it\nwould go up to the sky and be pleasing to Jupiter and the Mighty Folk\nwho lived with him among the clouds; and in this way they hoped to make\nfriends with Jupiter so that he would not hinder them in their work.",
        "But they needed water to wash the flesh and their hands; and so one of\nthe young men went down the hill to find some. He was gone so long that\nthe other young man became uneasy and went after him.",
        "Cadmus waited for them till the fire had burned low. He waited and\nwaited till the sun was high in the sky. He called and shouted, but no\none answered him. At last he took his sword in his hand and went down to\nsee what was the matter.",
        "He followed the path which his friends had taken, and soon came to a\nfine stream of cold water at the foot of a hill. He saw something move\namong the bushes which grew near it. It was a fierce dragon, waiting to\nspring upon him. There was blood on the grass and leaves, and it was not\nhard to guess what had become of the two young men.",
        "The beast sprang at Cadmus, and tried to seize him with its sharp claws.\nBut Cadmus leaped quickly aside and struck it in the neck with his long\nsword. A great stream of black blood gushed out, and the dragon soon\nfell to the ground dead. Cadmus had seen many fearful sights, but never\nanything so dreadful as this beast. He had never been in so great danger\nbefore. He sat down on the ground and trembled; and, all the time, he\nwas weeping for his two friends. How now was he to build a city, with no\none to help him?",
        "While Cadmus was still weeping he was surprised to hear some one calling\nhim. He stood up and looked around. On the hillside before him was a\ntall woman who had a helmet on her head and a shield in her hand. Her\neyes were gray, and her face, though not beautiful, was very noble.\nCadmus knew at once that she was Athena, the queen of the air–she who\ngives wisdom to men.",
        "Athena told Cadmus that he must take out the teeth of the dragon and sow\nthem in the ground. He thought that would be a queer kind of seed. But\nshe said that if he would do this, he would soon have men enough to help\nhim build his city; and, before he could say a word, she had gone out of\nhis sight.",
        "The dragon had a great many teeth–so many that when Cadmus had taken\nthem out they filled his helmet heaping full. The next thing was to find\na good place to sow them. Just as he turned away from the stream, he saw\na yoke of oxen standing a little way off. He went to them and found that\nthey were hitched to a plow. What more could he want? The ground in the\nmeadow was soft and black, and he drove the plow up and down, making\nlong furrows as he went. Then he dropped the teeth, one by one, into the\nfurrows and covered them over with the rich soil. When he had sown all\nof them in this way, he sat down on the hillside and watched to see what\nwould happen.",
        "In a little while the soil in the furrows began to stir. Then, at every\nplace that a tooth had been dropped, something bright grew up. It was a\nbrass helmet. The helmets pushed their way up, and soon the faces of men\nwere seen underneath, then their shoulders, then their arms, then their\nbodies; and then, before Cadmus could think, a thousand warriors leaped\nout of the furrows and shook off the black earth which was clinging to\nthem. Every man was clothed in a suit of brass armor; and every one had\na long spear in his right hand and a shield in his left.",
        "Cadmus was frightened when he saw the strange crop which had grown up\nfrom the dragon’s teeth. The men looked so fierce that he feared they\nwould kill him if they saw him. He hid himself behind his plow and then\nbegan to throw stones at them. The warriors did not know where the\nstones came from, but each thought that his neighbor had struck him.\nSoon they began to fight among themselves. Man after man was killed, and\nin a little while only five were left alive. Then Cadmus ran towards\nthem and called out:",
        "“Hold! Stop fighting! You are my men, and must come with me. We will\nbuild a city here.”",
        "The men obeyed him. They followed Cadmus to the top of the hill; and\nthey were such good workmen that in a few days they had built a house on\nthe spot where the cow had lain down.",
        "After that they built other houses, and people came to live in them.\nThey called the town Cadmeia, after Cadmus who was its first king. But\nwhen the place had grown to be a large city, it was known by the name of\nThebes.",
        "Cadmus was a wise king. The Mighty Folk who lived with Jupiter amid the\nclouds were well pleased with him and helped him in more ways than one.\nAfter a while he married Harmonia, the beautiful daughter of Mars. All\nthe Mighty Ones were at the wedding; and Athena gave the bride a\nwonderful necklace about which you may learn something more at another\ntime.",
        "But the greatest thing that Cadmus did is yet to be told. He was the\nfirst schoolmaster of the Greeks, and taught them the letters which were\nused in his own country across the sea. They called the first of these\nletters alpha and the second beta, and that is why men speak of the\nalphabet to this day. And when the Greeks had learned the alphabet\nfrom Cadmus, they soon began to read and write, and to make beautiful\nand useful books.",
        "As for the maiden Europa, she was carried safe over the sea to a distant\nshore. She may have been happy in the new, strange land to which she was\ntaken–I cannot tell; but she never heard of friends or home again.\nWhether it was really Jupiter in the form of a bull that carried her\naway, nobody knows. It all happened so long ago that there may have been\nsome mistake about the story; and I should not think it strange if it\nwere a sea robber who stole her from her home, and a swift ship with\nwhite sails that bore her away. Of one thing I am very sure: she was\nloved so well by all who knew her that the great unknown country to\nwhich she was taken has been called after her name ever since–Europe.",
