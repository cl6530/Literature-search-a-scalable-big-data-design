        "As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover\nher spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption\non those subjects that must deaden them more.  Mr. Darcy’s\nbehaviour astonished and vexed her.",
        "“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\"\nsaid she, “did he come at all?”",
        "She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.",
        "“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and\naunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?  If he fears me,\nwhy come hither?  If he no longer cares for me, why silent?\nTeasing, teasing, man!  I will think no more about him.”",
        "Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by\nthe approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful\nlook, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors,\nthan Elizabeth.",
        "“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel\nperfectly easy.  I know my own strength, and I shall never be\nembarrassed again by his coming.  I am glad he dines here on\nTuesday.  It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides,\nwe meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.”",
        "“Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly.\n“Oh, Jane, take care.”",
        "“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger\nnow?”",
        "“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much\nin love with you as ever.”",
        "                          * * * * *",
        "They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and\nMrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the\nhappy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness\nof Bingley, in half an hour’s visit, had revived.",
        "On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn;\nand the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of\ntheir punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.  When\nthey repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to\nsee whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their\nformer parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.  Her\nprudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite\nhim to sit by herself.  On entering the room, he seemed to\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to\nsmile: it was decided.  He placed himself by her.",
        "Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\nfriend.  He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\nimagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy,\nhad she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy,\nwith an expression of half-laughing alarm.",
        "His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\nshowed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than\nformerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,\nJane’s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.\nThough she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet\nreceived pleasure from observing his behaviour.  It gave her\nall the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\nno cheerful humour.  Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as\nthe table could divide them.  He was on one side of her mother.\nShe knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to\neither, or make either appear to advantage.  She was not near\nenough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how\nseldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was\ntheir manner whenever they did.  Her mother’s ungraciousness,\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s\nmind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be\nprivileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown\nnor unfelt by the whole of the family.",
        "She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity\nof bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would\nnot pass away without enabling them to enter into something\nmore of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation\nattending his entrance.  Anxious and uneasy, the period which\npassed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was\nwearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.",
        "“If he does not come to me, then,” said she, “I shall give\nhim up for ever.”",
        "The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would\nhave answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded\nround the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and\nElizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy\nthat there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit\nof a chair.  And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of the\ngirls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:",
        "“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined.  We want\nnone of them; do we?”",
        "Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.  She\nfollowed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke,\nhad scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and\nthen was enraged against herself for being so silly!",
        "“A man who has once been refused!  How could I ever be foolish\nenough to expect a renewal of his love?  Is there one among the\nsex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second\nproposal to the same woman?  There is no indignity so abhorrent\nto their feelings!”",
        "She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\ncoffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:",
        "“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”",
        "“Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”",
        "“And quite alone?  Have all her friends left her?”",
        "“Mrs. Annesley is with her.  The others have been gone on to\nScarborough, these three weeks.”",
        "She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to\nconverse with her, he might have better success.  He stood by\nher, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on\nthe young lady’s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.",
        "When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed,\nthe ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon\njoined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him\nfall a victim to her mother’s rapacity for whist players, and\nin a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.  She\nnow lost every expectation of pleasure.  They were confined for\nthe evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope,\nbut that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the\nroom, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.",
        "Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen\nto supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any\nof the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.",
        "“Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,\n“What say you to the day?  I think every thing has passed off\nuncommonly well, I assure you.  The dinner was as well dressed\nas any I ever saw.  The venison was roasted to a turn–and\neverybody said they never saw so fat a haunch.  The soup was\nfifty times better than what we had at the Lucases’ last week;\nand even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were\nremarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\ncooks at least.  And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in\ngreater beauty.  Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether\nyou did not.  And what do you think she said besides? ’Ah! Mrs.\nBennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.’  She did\nindeed.  I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever\nlived–and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not\nat all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”",
        "Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen\nenough of Bingley’s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she\nwould get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her\nfamily, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that\nshe was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the\nnext day, to make his proposals.",
        "“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to\nElizabeth.  “The party seemed so well selected, so suitable\none with the other.  I hope we may often meet again.”",
        "Elizabeth smiled.",
        "“Lizzy, you must not do so.  You must not suspect me.  It\nmortifies me.  I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy\nhis conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man,\nwithout having a wish beyond it.  I am perfectly satisfied,\nfrom what his manners now are, that he never had any design\nof engaging my affection.  It is only that he is blessed\nwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of\ngenerally pleasing, than any other man.”",
        "“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me\nsmile, and are provoking me to it every moment.”",
        "“How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”",
        "“And how impossible in others!”",
        "“But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\nacknowledge?”",
        "“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.  We all\nlove to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth\nknowing.  Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do\nnot make me your confidante.”",
