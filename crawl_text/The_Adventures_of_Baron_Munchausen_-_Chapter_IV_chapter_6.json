        "  Reflections on Saint Hubert’s stag–Shoots a stag with cherry-\n  stones; the wonderful effects of it–Kills a bear by extraordinary\n  dexterity; his danger pathetically described–Attacked by a wolf,\n  which he turns inside out–Is assailed by a mad dog, from which he\n  escapes–The Baron’s cloak seized with madness, by which his whole\n  wardrobe is thrown into confusion.",
        "You have heard, I dare say, of the hunter and sportsman’s saint and\nprotector, St. Hubert, and of the noble stag, which appeared to him in\nthe forest, with the holy cross between his antlers. I have paid my\nhomage to that saint every year in good fellowship, and seen this stag\na thousand times, either painted in churches, or embroidered in the\nstars of his knights; so that, upon the honour and conscience of a\ngood sportsman, I hardly know whether there may not have been\nformerly, or whether there are not such crossed stags even at this\npresent day. But let me rather tell what I have seen myself. Having\none day spent all my shot, I found myself unexpectedly in presence of\na stately stag, looking at me as unconcernedly as if he had known of\nmy empty pouches. I charged immediately with powder, and upon it a\ngood handful of cherry-stones, for I had sucked the fruit as far as\nthe hurry would permit. Thus I let fly at him, and hit him just on the\nmiddle of the forehead, between his antlers; it stunned him–he\nstaggered–yet he made off. A year or two after, being with a party in\nthe same forest, I beheld a noble stag with a fine full grown cherry-\ntree above ten feet high between his antlers. I immediately\nrecollected my former adventure, looked upon him as my property, and\nbrought him to the ground by one shot, which at once gave me the\nhaunch and cherry-sauce; for the tree was covered with the richest\nfruit, the like I had never tasted before. Who knows but some\npassionate holy sportsman, or sporting abbot or bishop, may have shot,\nplanted, and fixed the cross between the antlers of St. Hubert’s stag,\nin a manner similar to this? They always have been, and still are,\nfamous for plantations of crosses and antlers; and in a case of\ndistress or dilemma, which too often happens to keen sportsmen, one is\napt to grasp at anything for safety, and to try any expedient rather\nthan miss the favourable opportunity. I have many times found myself\nin that trying situation.",
        "What do you say of this, for example? Daylight and powder were spent\none day in a Polish forest. When I was going home a terrible bear made\nup to me in great speed, with open mouth, ready to fall upon me; all\nmy pockets were searched in an instant for powder and ball, but in\nvain; I found nothing but two spare flints: one I flung with all my\nmight into the monster’s open jaws, down his throat. It gave him pain\nand made him turn about, so that I could level the second at his back-\ndoor, which, indeed, I did with wonderful success; for it flew in, met\nthe first flint in the stomach, struck fire, and blew up the bear with\na terrible explosion. Though I came safe off that time, yet I should\nnot wish to try it again, or venture against bears with no other\nammunition.",
        "There is a kind of fatality in it. The fiercest and most dangerous\nanimals generally came upon me when defenceless, as if they had a\nnotion or an instinctive intimation of it. Thus a frightful wolf\nrushed upon me so suddenly, and so close, that I could do nothing but\nfollow mechanical instinct, and thrust my fist into his open mouth.\nFor safety’s sake I pushed on and on, till my arm was fairly in up to\nthe shoulder. How should I disengage myself? I was not much pleased\nwith my awkward situation–with a wolf face to face; our ogling was\nnot of the most pleasant kind. If I withdrew my arm, then the animal\nwould fly the more furiously upon me; that I saw in his flaming eyes.\nIn short, I laid hold of his tail, turned him inside out like a glove,\nand flung him to the ground, where I left him.",
        "The same expedient would not have answered against a mad dog, which\nsoon after came running against me in a narrow street at St.\nPetersburg. Run who can, I thought; and to do this the better, I threw\noff my fur cloak, and was safe within doors in an instant. I sent my\nservant for the cloak, and he put it in the wardrobe with my other\nclothes. The day after I was amazed and frightened by Jack’s bawling,\n“For God’s sake, sir, your fur cloak is mad!” I hastened up to him,\nand found almost all my clothes tossed about and torn to pieces. The\nfellow was perfectly right in his apprehensions about the fur cloak’s\nmadness. I saw him myself just then falling upon a fine full-dress\nsuit, which he shook and tossed in an unmerciful manner.",
