        "On the day after the funeral, Mrs. Ranger and the two children and young\nHargrave were in the back parlor, waiting for Judge Torrey to come and\nread the will. The well-meant intrusions, the services, the burial–all\nthose barbarous customs that stretch on the rack those who really love\nthe dead whom society compels them publicly to mourn–had left cruel\nmarks on Adelaide and on Arthur; but their mother seemed unchanged. She\nwas talking incessantly now, addressing herself to Dory, since he alone\nwas able to heed her. Her talk was an almost incoherent stream, as if she\nneither knew nor cared what she was saying so long as she could keep that\nstream going–the stream whose sound at least made the voice in her\nheart, the voice of desolation, less clear and terrible, though not less\ninsistent.",
        "There was the beat of a man’s footsteps on the side veranda. Mrs. Ranger\nstarted up, listened, sat again. “Oh,” she said, in the strangest tone,\nand with a hysterical little laugh, “I thought it was your father coming\nhome to dinner!” Then from her throat issued a stifled cry like nothing\nbut a cry borne up to the surface from a deep torture-chamber. And she\nwas talking on again–with Adelaide sobbing and Arthur fighting back the\ntears. Hargrave went to the door and admitted the old lawyer.",
        "He had a little speech which he always made on such occasions; but\nto-day, with the knowledge of the astounding contents of that will on his\nmind, his lips refused to utter it. He simply bowed, seated himself, and\nopened the document. The old-fashioned legal phrases soon were steadying\nhim as the harness steadies an uneasy horse; and he was monotonously and\nsonorously rolling off paragraph after paragraph. Except the judge, young\nHargrave was the only one there who clearly understood what those wordy\nprovisions meant. As the reading progressed Dory’s face flushed a deep\nred which slowly faded, leaving him gray and haggard. His father’s\nbeloved project! His father’s! To carry out his father’s project,\nArthur and Adelaide, the woman he loved and her brother, were to lose\ntheir inheritance. He could not lift his eyes. He felt that they were all\nlooking at him, were hurling reproaches and denunciations.",
        "Presently Judge Torrey read: “I make this disposal of my estate through\nmy love for my children and because I have firm belief in the soundness\nof their character, and in their capacity to do and to be. I feel they\nwill be better off without the wealth which would tempt my son to relax\nhis efforts to make a useful man of himself and would cause my daughter\nto be sought for her fortune instead of for herself.”",
        "At the words “without the wealth,” Arthur shifted sharply in his chair,\nand both he and Adelaide looked at Judge Torrey in puzzled wonder. The\njudge read on, read the names of signer and witnesses, then laid the will\ndown and stared gloomily at it. Mrs. Ranger said: “And now, judge, can\nyou tell us in plain words just what it means?”",
        "With many a pause and stammer the old lawyer made it clear: the house and\nits contents and appurtenances, and seven thousand a year to the widow\nfor life; two thousand a year to Adelaide; five thousand in cash to\nArthur and the chance to earn the mill and factory; the rest, practically\nthe whole estate, to Tecumseh University.",
        "“Any further questions?” he asked, breaking the silence that followed his\nexplanation.",
        "No one spoke.",
        "Still without looking at anyone, he put away his glasses? “Then I\nguess I’ll be going. It won’t be necessary to do anything further for\na day or two.”",
        "And, with face like that of criminal slinking from scene of crime, he\ngot himself to the door by a series of embarrassed bows and shuffling\nsteps. Outside, he wiped the streaming sweat from his forehead. “It\nwasn’t my fault,” he muttered, as if some one were accusing him. Then, a\nlittle further from the house, “I ain’t sure Hiram hasn’t done right.\nBut, God help me, I couldn’t never save my children at such a price.”",
        "He was clear of the grounds before Adelaide, the first to move, cast a\nfurtive glance at her brother. Her own disaster was swallowed up for her\nin the thought of how he had been struck down. But she could read nothing\nin his face. He was simply gazing straight ahead, and looking so like\nhis father at his most unfathomable. As soon as he had fully realized\nwhat the will meant, his nerves had stopped feeling and his brain had\nstopped thinking. Adelaide next noted Dory, and grew cold from head to\nfoot. All in a rush it came over her how much she had relied upon her\nprospective inheritance, how little upon herself. What would Dory think\nof her now? And Ross–what a triumph for him, what a narrow escape! Had\nhe suspected? Had others in the town known that of which they of the\nfamily were in complete ignorance? Oh, the horror of the descent–the\nhorror of the rude snatching away of the golden aureole! “Father, father,\nhow could you do it? How could you hurt us so?” she muttered. Then, up\nbefore her rose his face with that frightful look in the eyes. “But how\ndoing it made him suffer!” she thought. And the memory of those hours\non hours she had spent with him, buried alive, flooded over her. “Doing\nit killed him!” she said to herself.",
        "She felt cruel fingers grinding into her arm. With a sharp cry she sprang\nup. Her brother was facing her, his features ablaze with all the evil\npassions in his untrained and unrestrained nature. ’You knew!” he\nhissed. “You traitor! You knew he was doing this. You honeyfugled him.\nAnd you and Hargrave get it all!”",
        "Adelaide shrank as she would not have shrunk under a lash.",
        "“O Arthur! Arthur!” she cried, clasping her hands and stretching them\ntoward him.",
        "“You admit it, do you?” he shouted, seizing her by the shoulders like a\nmadman. “Yes, your guilty face admits it. But I’ll undo your work. I’ll\nbreak the will. Such an outrage as that, such a robbery, won’t stand in\ncourt for a minute.”",
        "Dory had risen, was moving to fling the brother from the sister; but Mrs.\nRanger was before him. Starting up from the stupor into which Judge\nTorrey’s explanation had thrown her, she thrust herself between her\nchildren. “Arthur!” she said, and her voice was quiet and solemn. “Your\nfather is dead.” She drew herself up, and facing her son in her widow’s\nblack, seemed taller than he. “If I had needed any proof that he was\nright about what he did with his own,” she went on, “I’d have found it in\nyour face and in what you just said to your sister. Go to the glass\nthere, boy! Look at your face and remember your words!”",
        "Young Hargrave left the room, went to the garden where they could see him\nfrom the windows and call him if they wished. Arthur hung his head before\nhis mother’s gaze. “It isn’t his will,” he muttered. “Father in his\nright mind would never have made such a will.”",
        "“He never would have made such a will if his children had been in their\nright mind,” replied his mother sternly; and sternness they had never\nbefore seen in those features or heard in that voice. “I know now what he\nwas broodin’ over for weeks. Yes–” and her voice, which rose shrill, was\nthe shriek of the tempest within her–\"and I know now what made him\nbreak so sudden. I noticed you both driftin’ off into foolishness,\nashamed of the ways of your parents, ashamed of your parents, too. But I\ndidn’t give no attention to it, because I thought it was the silliness of\nchildren and that you’d outgrow it. But he always did have a good head\non him, and he saw that you were ridin’ loose-rein to ruin–to be like\nthem Whitneys. Your pa not in his right mind? I see God in that will.”",
        "She paused, but only for breath to resume: “And you, Arthur Ranger, what\nwas in your head when you came here to-day? Grief and love and\nwillingness to carry out your dead father’s last wishes? No! You came\nthinking of how you were to benefit by his death. Don’t deny! I saw your\nface when you found you weren’t going to get your father’s money.”",
        "“Mother!” exclaimed Arthur.",
        "She waved him down imperiously; and he was afraid before her, before her\noutraged love for her outraged dead. “Take care how you stamp on my\nHiram’s grave, Arthur Ranger!”",
        "“He didn’t mean it–you know he didn’t,” pleaded Adelaide. At that moment\nshe could not think of this woman as her mother, but only as the wife,\nthe widow.",
        "But Ellen’s instinct told her that her son, though silent, was still in\ntraitorous rebellion against her idol. And she kept on at him: “With\nHiram hardly out of the house, you’ve forgot all he did for you, all he\nleft you–his good name, his good example. You think only of his money.\nI’ve heard you say children owe nothing to their parents, that parents\nowe everything to the children. Well, that’s so. But it don’t mean what\nyou think. It don’t mean that parents ought to ruin their children.\nAnd your pa didn’t spare himself to do his duty by you–not even though\nit killed him. Yes, it killed him! You’d better go away and fall on your\nknees and ask God to forgive you for having shortened your father’s\nlife. And I tell you, Arthur Ranger, till you change your heart, you’re\nno son of mine.”",
        "“Mother! Mother!” cried Arthur, rushing from the room.",
        "Mrs. Ranger looked vacantly at the place where he had been, dropped into\na chair and burst into a storm of tears.",
        "“Call him back, mother,” entreated Del.",
        "“No! no!” sobbed Ellen Ranger. “He spoke agin’ my dead! I’ll not forgive\nhim till his heart changes.”",
        "Adelaide knelt beside her mother and tried to put her arms around her.\nBut her mother shrank away. “Don’t touch me!” she cried; “leave me\nalone. God forgive me for having bore children that trample on their\nfather’s grave. I’ll put you both out of the house–” and she started up\nand her voice rose to a shriek. “Yes–I’ll put you both out! Your\nfoolishness has ate into you like a cancer, till you’re both rotten. Go\nto the Whitneys. Go among the lepers where you belong. You ain’t fit for\ndecent people.”",
        "She pushed Adelaide aside, and with uncertain steps went into the hall\nand up toward her own room.",
