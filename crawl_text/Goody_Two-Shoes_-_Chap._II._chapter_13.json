        " A Scene of Distress; in the School.",
        "It happened one Day, when Mrs. Two-Shoes was diverting the\nChildren after Dinner, as she usually did with some innocent Games, or\nentertaining and instructive Stories, that a Man arrived with the\nmelancholy News of Sally Jones’s Father being thrown from his\nHorse, and thought past all Recovery; nay, the Messenger said, that he\nwas seemingly dying, when he came away. Poor Sally was greatly\ndistressed, as indeed were all the School, for she dearly loved her\nFather, and Mrs. Two-Shoes, and all the Children dearly loved\nher. It is generally said, that we never know the real Value of our\nParents or Friends till we have lost them; but poor Sally felt\nthis by Affection, and her Mistress knew it by Experience. All the\nSchool were in Tears, and the Messenger was obliged to return; but\nbefore he went, Mrs. Two-Shoes, unknown to the Children,\nordered Tom Pidgeon to go home with the Man, and bring a Letter\nto inform her how Mr. Jones did. They set out together, and the\nPidgeon rode on the Man’s Head, (as you see here) for the Man was able\nto carry the Pidgeon, though the Pidgeon was not able to carry the\nMan, if he had, they would have been there much sooner, for TomPidgeon was very good, and never staid on an Errand.",
        "Soon after the Man was gone the Pidgeon was lost, and the Concern the\nChildren were under for Mr. Jones and little Sally was\nin some Measure diverted, and Part of their Attention turned after\nTom, who was a great Favourite, and consequently much bewailed.\nMrs. Margery, who knew the great Use and Necessity of teaching\nChildren to submit chearfully to the Will of Providence, bid them wipe\naway their Tears, and then kissing Sally, you must be a good\nGirl, says she, and depend upon GOD Almighty for his Blessing and\nProtection; for he is a Father to the Fatherless, and defendeth all\nthose who put their Trust in him. She then told them a Story,\nwhich I shall relate in as few Words as possible.",
        "            The History of Mr. Lovewell, Father\n                          to Lady Lucy.",
        "Mr. Lovewell was born at Bath, and apprenticed to a\nlaborious Trade in London, which being too hard for him, he\nparted with his Master by Consent, and hired himself as a common\nServant to a Merchant in the City. Here he spent his leisure Hours not\nas Servants too frequently do, in Drinking and Schemes of Pleasure,\nbut in improving his Mind; and among other Acquirements, he made\nhimself a complete Master of Accompts. His Sobriety, Honesty, and the\nRegard he paid to his Master’s Interest, greatly recommended him in\nthe whole Family, and he had several Offices of Trust committed to his\nCharge, in which he acquitted himself so well, that the Merchant\nremoved him from the Stable into the Counting-house.",
        "Here he soon made himself Master of the Business, and became so useful\nto the Merchant, that in regard to his faithful Services, and the\nAffection he had for him, he married him to his own Niece, a prudent\nagreeable young Lady; and gave him a Share in the Business. See what\nHonesty and Industry will do for us. Half the great Men in\nLondon, I am told, have made themselves by this Means, and who\nwould but be honest and industrious, when it is so much our Interest\nand our Duty.",
        "After some Years the Merchant died, and left Mr. Lovewellpossessed of many fine Ships at Sea, and much Money, and he was happy\nin a Wife, who had brought him a Son and two Daughters, all dutiful\nand obedient. The Treasures and good Things, however, of this Life are\nso uncertain, that a Man can never be happy, unless he lays the\nFoundation for it in his own Mind. So true is that Copy in our Writing\nBooks, which tells us, that a contented Mind is a continual\nFeast.",
        "After some Years successful Trade, he thought his Circumstances\nsufficient to insure his own Ships, or, in other Words, to send his\nShips and Goods to Sea without being insured by others, as is\ncustomary among Merchants; when, unfortunately for him, four of them\nrichly laden were lost at Sea. This he supported with becoming\nResolution; but the next Mail brought him Advice, that nine others\nwere taken by the French, with whom we were then at War; and\nthis, together with the Failure of three foreign Merchants whom he had\ntrusted, compleated his Ruin. He was then obliged to call his\nCreditors together, who took his Effects, and being angry with him for\nthe imprudent Step of not insuring his Ships, left him destitute of\nall Subsistence. Nor did the Flatterers of his Fortune, those who had\nlived by his Bounty when in his Prosperity, pay the least Regard\neither to him or his Family. So true is another Copy, that you will\nfind in your Writing Book, which says, Misfortune tries our\nFriends. All these Slights of his pretended Friends, and the ill\nUsage of his Creditors, both he and his Family bore with Christian\nFortitude; but other Calamities fell upon him, which he felt more\nsensibly.",
        "In his Distress, one of his Relations, who lived at Florence,\noffered to take his Son; and another, who lived at Barbadoes,\nsent for one of his Daughters. The Ship which his Son sailed in was\ncast away, and all the Crew supposed to be lost; and the Ship, in\nwhich his Daughter went a Passenger, was taken by Pyrates, and one\nPost brought the miserable Father an Account of the Loss of his two\nChildren. This was the severest Stroke of all: It made him compleatly\nwretched, and he knew it must have a dreadful Effect on his Wife and\nDaughter; he therefore endeavoured to conceal it from them. But the\nperpetual Anxiety he was in, together with the Loss of his Appetite\nand Want of Rest, soon alarmed his Wife. She found something was\nlabouring in his Breast, which was concealed from her; and one Night\nbeing disturbed in a Dream, with what was ever in his Thoughts, and\ncalling out upon his dear Children; she awoke him, and insisted upon\nknowing the Cause of his Inquietude. Nothing, my Dear, nothing,\nsays he, The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be\nthe Name of the Lord. This was sufficient to alarm the poor Woman;\nshe lay till his Spirits were composed, and as she thought asleep,\nthen stealing out of Bed, got the Keys and opened his Bureau, where\nshe found the fatal Account. In the Height of her Distractions, she\nflew to her Daughter’s Room, and waking her with her Shrieks, put the\nLetters into her Hands. The young Lady, unable to support this Load of\nMisery, fell into a Fit, from which it was thought she never could\nhave been recovered. However, at last she revived; but the Shock was\nso great, that it entirely deprived her of her Speech.",
        "Thus loaded with Misery, and unable to bear the Slights and Disdain of\nthose who had formerly professed themselves Friends, this unhappy Family\nretired into a Country, where they were unknown, in order to hide\nthemselves from the World; when, to support their Independency, the\nFather laboured as well as he could at Husbandry, and the Mother and\nDaughter sometimes got spinning and knitting Work, to help to furnish\nthe Means of Subsistence; which however was so precarious and uncertain,\nthat they often, for many Weeks together, lived on nothing but Cabbage\nand Bread boiled in Water. But God never forsaketh the Righteous, nor\nsuffereth those to perish who put their Trust in him. At this Time a\nLady, who was just come to England, sent to take a pleasant Seat ready\nfurnished in that Neighbourhood, and the Person who was employed for the\nPurpose, was ordered to deliver a Bank Note of an hundred Pounds to Mr.\nLovewell, another hundred to his Wife, and fifty to the Daughter,\ndesiring them to take Possession of the House, and get it well aired\nagainst she came down, which would be in two or three Days at most.\nThis, to People who were almost starving, was a sweet and seasonable\nRelief, and they were all sollicitous to know their Benefactress, but of\nthat the Messenger himself was too ignorant to inform them. However, she\ncame down sooner than was expected, and with Tears embraced them again\nand again: After which she told the Father and Mother she had heard from\ntheir Daughter, who was her Acquaintance, and that she was well and on\nher Return to England. This was the agreeable Subject of their\nConversation till after Dinner, when drinking their Healths, she again\nwith Tears saluted them, and falling upon her Knees asked their\nBlessings.",
        "Tis impossible to express the mutual Joy which this occasioned. Their\nConversation was made up of the most endearing Expressions,\nintermingled with Tears and Caresses. Their Torrent of Joy, however,\nwas for a Moment interrupted, by a Chariot which stopped at the Gate,\nand which brought as they thought a very unseasonable Visitor, and\ntherefore she sent to be excused from seeing Company.",
        "But this had no Effect, for a Gentleman richly dressed jumped out of\nthe Chariot, and pursuing the Servant into the Parlour saluted them\nround, who were all astonished at his Behaviour. But when the Tears\ntrickled from his Cheeks, the Daughter, who had been some Years dumb,\nimmediately cried out, my Brother! my Brother! my Brother! and\nfrom that Instant recovered her Speech. The mutual Joy which this\noccasioned, is better felt than expressed. Those who have proper\nSentiments of Humanity, Gratitude, and filial Piety will rejoice at\nthe Event, and those who have a proper Idea of the Goodness of God,\nand his gracious Providence, will from this, as well as other\nInstances of his Goodness and Mercy, glorify his holy Name, and\nmagnify his Wisdom and Power, who is a Shield to the Righteous, and\ndefendeth all those who put their Trust in him.",
        "As you, my dear Children, may be sollicitous to know how this happy\nEvent was brought about, I must inform you, that Mr. Lovewell’s Son,\nwhen the Ship foundered, had with some others got into the long Boat,\nand was taken up by a Ship at Sea, and carried to the East Indies,\nwhere in a little Time he made a large Fortune; and the Pirates who\ntook his Daughter, attempted to rob her of her Chastity; but finding\nher Inflexible, and determined to die rather than to submit, some of\nthem behaved to her in a very cruel Manner; but others, who had more\nHonour and Generosity, became her Defenders; upon which a Quarrel\narose between them, and the Captain, who was the worst of the Gang,\nbeing killed, the rest of the Crew carried the Ship into a Port of the\nManilla Islands, belonging to the Spaniards; where, when her Story\nwas known, she was treated with great Respect, and courted by a young\nGentleman, who was taken ill of a Fever, and died before the Marriage\nwas agreed on, but left her his whole Fortune.",
        "You see, my dear Sally, how wonderfully these People were\npreserved, and made happy after such extreme Distress; we are\ntherefore never to despair, even under the greatest Misfortunes, for\nGOD Almighty is All-powerful and can deliver us at any Time. Remember\nJob, but I think you have not read so far, take the Bible,\nBilly Jones, and read the History of that good and patient Man.\nAt this Instant something was heard to slap at the Window, Wow,\nwow, wow, says Jumper, and attempted to leap up and open the Door,\nat which the Children were surprized; but Mrs. Margery knowing\nwhat it was, opened the Casement, as Noah did the Window of the\nArk, and drew in Tom Pidgeon with a Letter, and see here he is.",
        "As soon as he was placed on the Table, he walked up to little\nSally, and dropping the Letter, cried, Co, Co, Coo, as\nmuch as to say, there read it. Now this poor Pidgeon had\ntravelled fifty Miles in about an Hour, to bring Sally this\nLetter, and who would destroy such pretty Creatures.–But let us read\nthe Letter.",
        "My dear Sally,",
        "GOD Almighty has been very merciful, and restored your Pappa to us\nagain, who is now so well as to be able to sit up. I hear you are a\ngood Girl, my Dear, and I hope you will never forget to praise the\nLord for this his great Goodness and Mercy to us–What a sad Thing it\nwould have been if your Father had died, and left both you and me, and\nlittle Tommy in Distress, and without a Friend: Your Father\nsends his Blessing with mine–Be good, my dear Child, and God Almighty\nwill also bless you, whose Blessing is above all Things.",
        "I am, my Dear Sally,",
        "Your ever affectionate Mother,",
        "Martha Jones.",
