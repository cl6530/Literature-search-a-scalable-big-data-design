        "\n\n",
        "    “For what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, to love\n    mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.\"–MICAH.",
        "    “Pure religion and undefiled is this, to visit the fatherless and\n    widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the\n    world.\"–JAMES I.",
        "    “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”",
        "    2 CORINTHIANS.",
        "It would be quite out of place here to enter into any discussion of\ntheological problems or to advocate any particular doctrines. Nevertheless\nI could not omit what is to most so great a comfort and support in sorrow\nand suffering, and a source of the purest happiness.",
        "We commonly, however, bring together under this term two things which are\nyet very different: the religion of the heart, and that of the head. The\nfirst deals with conduct, and the duties of Man; the second with the\nnature of the supernatural and the future of the soul, being in fact a\nbranch of knowledge.",
        "Religion should be a strength, guide, and comfort, not a source of\nintellectual anxiety or angry argument. To persecute for religion’s sake\nimplies belief in a jealous, cruel, and unjust Deity. If we have done our\nbest to arrive at the truth, to torment oneself about the result is to\ndoubt the goodness of God, and, in the words of Bacon, “to bring down the\nHoly Ghost, instead of the likeness of a dove, in the shape of a raven.\"\n“The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life,” and the first duty of\nreligion is to form the highest possible conception of God.",
        "Many a man, however, and still more many a woman, render themselves\nmiserable on entering life by theological doubts and difficulties. These\nhave reference, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, not to what we\nshould do, but to what we should think. As regards action, conscience is\ngenerally a ready guide; to follow it is the real difficulty. Theology, on\nthe other hand, is a most abstruse science; but as long as we honestly\nwish to arrive at truth we need not fear that we shall be punished for\nunintentional error. “For what,” says Micah, “doth the Lord require of\nthee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.\"\nThere is very little theology in the Sermon on the Mount, or indeed in any\npart of the Gospels; and the differences which keep us apart have their\norigin rather in the study than the Church. Religion was intended to bring\npeace on earth and goodwill toward men, and whatever tends to hatred and\npersecution, however correct in the letter, must be utterly wrong in the\nspirit.",
        "How much misery would have been saved to Europe if Christians had been\nsatisfied with the Sermon on the Mount!",
        "Bokhara is said to have contained more than three hundred colleges, all\noccupied with theology, but ignorant of everything else, and it was\nprobably one of the most bigoted and uncharitable cities in the world.\n“Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.”",
        "We must not forget that",
        "  “He prayeth best who loveth best\n    All things both great and small.”",
        "Theologians too often appear to agree that",
        "  “The awful shadow of some unseen power\n    Floats, though unseen, among us\"; [1]",
        "and in the days of the Inquisition many must have sighed for the cheerful\nchild-like religion of the Greeks, if they could but have had the Nymphs\nand Nereids, the Fays and Faeries, with Destiny and Fate, but without\nJupiter and Mars.",
        "Sects are the work of Sectarians. No truly great religious teacher, as\nCarlyle said, ever intended to found a new Sect.",
        "Diversity of worship, says a Persian proverb, “has divided the human race\ninto seventy-two nations.” From among all their dogmas I have selected\none–\"Divine Love.” And again, “He needs no other rosary whose thread of\nlife is strung with the beads of love and thought.”",
        "There is more true Christianity in some pagan Philosophers than in certain\nChristian theologians. Take, for instance, Plato, Marcus Aurelius,\nEpictetus, and Plutarch.",
        "“Now I, Callicles,” says Socrates, “am persuaded of the truth of these\nthings, and I consider how I shall present my soul whole and undefiled\nbefore the judge in that day. Renouncing the honors at which the world\naims, I desire only to know the truth, and to live as well as I can, and,\nwhen the time comes, to die. And, to the utmost of my power, I exhort all\nother men to do the same. And in return for your exhortation of me, I\nexhort you also to take part in the great combat, which is the combat of\nlife, and greater than every other earthly conflict.”",
        "“As to piety toward the Gods,” says Epictetus, “you must know that this is\nthe chief thing, to have right opinions about them, to think that they\nexist, and that they administer the All well and justly; and you must fix\nyourself in this principle (duty), to obey them, and to yield to them in\neverything which happens, and voluntarily to follow it as being\naccomplished by the wisest intelligence.”",
        "“Do not act,” says Marcus Aurelius, “as if thou wert going to live ten\nthousand years. Death hangs over thee. While thou livest, while it is in\nthy power, be good....",
        "“Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment,\nregulate every act and thought accordingly. But to go away from among men,\nif there be gods, is not a thing to be afraid of, for the gods will not\ninvolve thee in evil; but if indeed they do not exist, or if they have no\nconcern about human affairs, what is it to me to live in a universe devoid\nof gods, or devoid of Providence. But in truth they do exist, and they do\ncare for human things, and they have put all the means in man’s power to\nenable him not to fall into real evils. And as for the rest, if there was\nanything evil, they would have provided for this also, that it should be\naltogether in a man’s power not to fall into it.”",
        "And Plutarch: “The Godhead is not blessed by reason of his silver and\ngold, nor yet Almighty through his thunder and lightnings, but on account\nof knowledge and intelligence.”",
        "It is no doubt very difficult to arrive at the exact teaching of Eastern\nMoralists, but the same spirit runs through Oriental Literature. For\ninstance, in the Toy Cart, when the wicked Prince wishes Vita to murder\nthe Heroine, and says that no one would see him, Vita declares “All nature\nwould behold the crime–the Genii of the Grove, the Sun, the Moon, the\nWinds, the Vault of Heaven, the firm-set Earth, the mighty Yama who judges\nthe dead, and the conscious Soul.”",
        "Take even the most extreme type of difference. Is the man, says Plutarch,\n“a criminal who holds there are no gods; and is not he that holds them to\nbe such as the superstitious believe them, is he not possessed with\nnotions infinitely more atrocious? I for my part would much rather have\nmen say of me that there never was a Plutarch at all, nor is now, than to\nsay that Plutarch is a man inconstant, fickle, easily moved to anger,\nrevengeful for trifling provocations, vexed at small things.”",
        "There is no doubt a tone of doubting sadness in Roman moralists, as in\nHadrian’s dying lines to his soul–",
        "  “Animula, vagula, blandula\n  Hospes, comesque corporis\n  Qua nunc abibis in loca:\n  Pallidula, rigida, nudula,\n  Nec, ut soles, dabis jocos.”",
        "The same spirit indeed is expressed in the epitaph on the tomb of the Duke\nof Buckingham in Westminster Abbey–",
        "  “Dubius non improbus vixi\n  Incertus morior, non perturbatus;\n  Humanum est nescire et errare,\n    Deo confido\n  Omnipotenti benevolentissimo:\n  Ens entium miserere mei.”",
        "Many things have been mistaken for religion, selfishness especially, but\nalso fear, hope, love of music, of art, of pomp; scruples often take the\nplace of love, and the glory of heaven is sometimes made to depend upon\nprecious stones and jewelry. Many, as has been well said, run after\nChrist, not for the miracles, but for the loaves.",
        "In many cases religious differences are mainly verbal. There is an Eastern\ntale of four men, an Arab, a Persian, a Turk, and a Greek, who agreed to\nclub together for an evening meal, but when they had done so they\nquarrelled as to what it should be. The Turk proposed Azum, the Arab Aneb,\nthe Persian Anghur, while the Greek insisted on Stapylion. While they were\ndisputing",
        "  “Before their eyes did pass,\n  Laden with grapes, a gardener’s ass.\n  Sprang to his feet each man, and showed,\n  With eager hand, that purple load.\n  ’See Azum,’ said the Turk; and ’see\n  Anghur,’ the Persian; ’what should be\n  Better.’ ’Nay Aneb, Aneb ’tis,’\n  The Arab cried. The Greek said, ’This\n  Is my Stapylion.’ Then they bought\n  Their grapes in peace.\n  Hence be ye taught.” [2]",
        "It is said that on one occasion, when Dean Stanley had been explaining his\nviews to Lord Beaconsfield, the latter replied, “Ah! Mr. Dean, that is all\nvery well, but you must remember,–No dogmas, no Deans.” To lose such\nDeans as Stanley would indeed be a great misfortune; but does it follow?\nReligions, far from being really built on Dogmas, are too often weighed\ndown and crushed by them. No one can doubt that Stanley has done much to\nstrengthen the Church of England.",
        "We may not always agree with Spinoza, but is he not right when he says,\n“The first precept of the divine law, therefore, indeed its sum and\nsubstance, is to love God unconditionally as the supreme\ngood–unconditionally, I say, and not from any love or fear of aught\nbesides”? And again, that the very essence of religion is belief in “a\nSupreme Being who delights in justice and mercy, whom all who would be\nsaved are bound to obey, and whose worship consists in the practice of\njustice and charity toward our neighbors”?",
        "Doubt is of two natures, and we often confuse a wise suspension of\njudgment with the weakness of hesitation. To profess an opinion for which\nwe have no sufficient reason is clearly illogical, but when it is\nnecessary to act we must do so on the best evidence available, however\nslight that may be. Herein lies the importance of common sense, the\ninstincts of a General, the sagacity of a Statesman. Pyrrho, the\nrecognized representative of doubt, was often wise in suspending his\njudgment, however foolish in hesitating to act, and in apologizing when,\nafter resisting all the arguments of philosophy, an angry dog drove him\nfrom his position.",
        "Collect from the Bible all that Christ thought necessary for his\ndisciples, and how little Dogma there is. “Pure religion and undefiled is\nthis, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep\nhimself unspotted from the world.” “By this shall all men know that ye are\nmy disciples, if ye have love one to another.” “Suffer little children to\ncome unto me.” And one lesson which little children have to teach us is\nthat religion is an affair of the heart and not of the mind only.",
        "Why should we expect Religion to solve questions with reference to the\norigin and destiny of the Universe? We do not expect the most elaborate\ntreatise to tell us the origin of electricity or of heat. Natural History\nthrows no light on the origin of life. Has Biology ever professed to\nexplain existence?",
        "“Simonides was asked at Syracuse by Hiero, who or what God was, when he\nrequested a day’s time to think of his answer. On subsequent days he\nalways doubled the period required for deliberation; and when Hiero\ninquired the reason, he replied that the longer he considered the subject,\nthe more obscure it appeared.”",
        "The Vedas say, “In the midst of the sun is the light, in the midst of\nlight is truth, and in the midst of truth is the imperishable being.\"\nDeity has been defined as a circle whose centre is everywhere, and whose\ncircumference is nowhere, but the “God is love” of St. John appeals more\nforcibly to the human soul.",
        "The Church is not a place for study or speculation. Few but can sympathize\nwith Eugenie de Gurein in her tender affection for the little Chapel at\nCahuze where she tells us she left “tant de miseres.”",
        "Doubt does not exclude Faith.",
        "  “Perplexed in faith, but pure in deeds\n  At last he beat his music out.\n  There lies more faith in honest doubt,\n  Believe me, than in half the creeds.” [3]",
        "And if we must admit that many points are still, and probably long will be\ninvolved in obscurity, we may be pardoned if we indulge ourselves in\nvarious speculations both as to our beginning and our end.",
        "  “Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;\n  The soul that rises with us, our life’s star\n  Hath had elsewhere its setting,\n  And cometh from afar;\n  Not in entire forgetfulness,\n  And not in utter nakedness,\n  But trailing clouds of glory do we come\n  From God who is our home.” [4]",
        "Unfortunately many have attempted to compound for wickedness in life by\npurity of belief, a vain and fruitless effort. To do right is the sure\nladder which leads up to Heaven, though the true faith will help us to\nfind and to climb it.",
        "  “It is my duty to have loved the highest,\n  It surely was my profit had I known,\n  It would have been my pleasure had I seen.”",
        "But though religious truth can justify no bitterness, it is well worth any\namount of thought and study.",
        "I hope I shall not be supposed to depreciate any honest effort to arrive\nat truth, or to undervalue the devotion of those who have died for their\nreligion. But surely it is a mistake to regard martyrdom as a merit, when\nfrom their own point of view it was in reality a privilege.",
        "Let every man be persuaded in his own mind",
        "  “Truth is the highest thing that man may keep.” [5]",
        "To arrive at truth we should spare ourselves no pain, but certainly\ninflict none on others.",
        "We may be sure that quarrels will never advance religion, and that to\npersecute is no way to convert. No doubt those who consider that all who\ndo not agree with them will suffer eternal torments, seem logically\njustified in persecution even unto death. Such a course, if carried out\nconsistently, might stamp out a particular sect, and any sufferings which\ncould be inflicted here would on this hypothesis be as nothing in\ncomparison with the pains of Hell. Only it must be admitted that such a\nview of religion is incompatible with any faith in the goodness of God,\nand seems quite irreconcilable with the teaching of Christ.",
        "Moreover, the Inquisition has even from its own point of view proved\ngenerally a failure. The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church.",
        "“In obedience to the order of the Council of Constance (1415) the remains\nof Wickliffe were exhumed and burnt to ashes, and these cast into the\nSwift, a neighboring brook running hard by, and thus this brook hath\nconveyed his ashes into Avon; Avon into Severn; Severn into the narrow\nseas; they into the main ocean. And thus the ashes of Wickliffe are the\nemblem of his doctrine, which now is dispersed all the world over.” [6]",
        "The Talmud says that when a man once asked Shamai to teach him the Law in\none lesson, Shamai drove him away in anger. He then went to Hillel with\nthe same request. Hillel said, “Do unto others as you would have others do\nunto you. This is the whole Law; the rest, merely Commentaries upon it.”",
        "The Religion of the lower races is almost as a rule one of terror and of\ndread. Their deities are jealous and revengeful, cruel, merciless, and\nselfish, hateful and yet childish. They require to be propitiated by\nfeasts and offerings, often even by human sacrifices. They are not only\nexacting, but so capricious that, with the best intentions, it is often\nimpossible to be sure of pleasing them. From such evil beings Sorcerers\nand Witches derived their hellish powers. No one was safe. No one knew\nwhere danger lurked. Actions apparently the most trifling might be fraught\nwith serious risk: objects apparently the most innocent might be fatal.",
        "In many cases there are supposed to be deities of Crime, of Misfortunes,\nof Disease. These wicked Spirits naturally encourage evil rather than\ngood. An energetic friend of mine was sent to a district in India where\nsmallpox was specially prevalent, and where one of the principal Temples\nwas dedicated to the Goddess of that disease. He had the people\nvaccinated, in spite of some opposition, and the disease disappeared, much\nto the astonishment of the natives. But the priests of the Deity of\nSmallpox were not disconcerted; only they deposed the Image of their\ndiscomfited Goddess, and petitioned my friend for some emblem of himself\nwhich they might install in her stead.",
        "We who are fortunate enough to live in this comparatively enlightened\ncentury hardly realize how our ancestors suffered from their belief in the\nexistence of mysterious and malevolent beings; how their life was\nembittered and overshadowed by these awful apprehensions.",
        "As men, however, have risen in civilization, their religion has risen with\nthem; they have by degrees acquired higher and purer conceptions of divine\npower.",
        "We are only just beginning to realize that a loving and merciful Father\nwould not resent honest error, not even perhaps the attribution to him of\nsuch odious injustice. Yet what can be clearer than Christ’s teaching on\nthis point. He impressed it over and over again on his disciples. “The\nletter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”",
        "“If,” says Ruskin, “for every rebuke that we titter of men’s vices, we put\nforth a claim upon their hearts; if, for every assertion of God’s demands\nfrom them, we should substitute a display of His kindness to them; if side\nby side, with every warning of death, we could exhibit proofs and promises\nof immortality; if, in fine, instead of assuming the being of an awful\nDeity, which men, though they cannot and dare not deny, are always\nunwilling, sometimes unable, to conceive; we were to show them a near,\nvisible, inevitable, out all-beneficent Deity, whose presence makes the\nearth itself a heaven, I think there would be fewer deaf children sitting\nin the market-place.”",
        "But it must not be supposed that those who doubt whether the ultimate\ntruth of the Universe can be expressed in human words, or whether, even if\nit could, we should be able to comprehend it, undervalue the importance of\nreligious study. Quite the contrary. Their doubts arise not from pride,\nbut from humility: not because they do not appreciate divine truth, but on\nthe contrary they doubt whether we can appreciate it sufficiently, and are\nsceptical whether the infinite can be reduced to the finite.",
        "We may be sure that whatever may be right about religion, to quarrel over\nit must be wrong. “Let others wrangle,” said St. Augustine, “I will\nwonder.”",
        "Those who suspend their judgment are not on that account sceptics, and it\nis often those who think they know most, who are especially troubled by\ndoubts and anxiety.",
        "It was Wordsworth who wrote",
        "      “Great God, I had rather be\n    A Pagan suckled in some creed outworn;\n  So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,\n    Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn.”",
        "In religion, as with children at night, it is darkness and ignorance which\ncreate dread; light and love cast out fear.",
        "In looking forward to the future we may fairly hope with Ruskin that “the\ncharities of more and more widely extended peace are preparing the way for\na Christian Church which shall depend neither on ignorance for its\ncontinuance, nor on controversy for its progress, but shall reign at once\nin light and love.”",
