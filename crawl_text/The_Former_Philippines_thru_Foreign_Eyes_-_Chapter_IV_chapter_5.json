        "[Native distrust of Europeans.] A Scotch merchant to whom I brought\na letter of introduction invited me with such cordiality to come\nand stay with him, that I found myself unable to refuse. While thus\nliving under the roof and protection of one of the wealthiest and most\nrespected men in the city, the cabmen I employed insisted on being\npaid beforehand every time I rode in their vehicles. This distrust was\noccasioned by the scanty feeling of respect most of the Europeans in\nManila inspired in the minds of the natives. Many later observations\nconfirmed this impression. What a different state of things exists\nin Java and Singapore! The reason, however, is easily explained.",
        "[Dutch and English stand well in their colonies.] The Dutch are as\nlittle able as the English to acclimatize themselves in tropical\ncountries. They get all they can out of countries in which they are\nonly temporary sojourners, the former by forced service and monopoly,\nthe latter by commerce. In both cases, however, the end is accomplished\nby comparatively few individuals, whose official position and the\nlargeness of whose undertakings place them far above the mass of the\npopulation. In Java, moreover, the Europeans constitute the governing\nclasses, the natives the governed; and even in Singapore where both\nraces are equal before the law the few white men understand how to mark\nthe difference of race so distinctively that the natives without demur\nsurrender to them, though not by means of the law, the privileges of a\nhigher caste. The difference of religion does but widen the gap; and,\nfinally, every European there speaks the language of the country, while\nthe natives are totally ignorant of that spoken by the foreigners.",
        "[Dutch colonials well educated.] The Dutch officials are educated at\nhome in schools specially devoted to the East Indian service. The art\nof managing the natives, the upholding of prestige, which is considered\nthe secret of the Dutch power over the numerous native populations,\nforms an essential particular in their education. The Dutch, therefore,\nmanage their intercourse with the natives, no matter how much they\nintend to get out of them, in strict accordance with customary usage\n(adat); they never wound the natives’ amor propio and never expose\nthemselves in their own mutual intercourse, which remains a sealed\nbook to the inhabitants.",
        "[Spanish officials undesirables.] Things are different in the\nPhilippines. With the exception of those officials whose stay is\nlimited by the rules of the service, or by the place-hunting that\nensues at every change in the Spanish ministry, few Spaniards who\nhave once settled in the colony ever return home. It is forbidden\nto the priests, and most of the rest have no means of doing so. A\nconsiderable portion of them consist of subaltern officers, soldiers,\nsailors, political delinquents and refugees whom the mother-country\nhas got rid of; and not seldom of adventurers deficient both in means\nand desire for the journey back, for their life in the colony is far\npleasanter than that they were forced to lead in Spain. These latter\narrive without the slightest knowledge of the country and without\nbeing in the least prepared for a sojourn there. Many of them are so\nlazy that they won’t take the trouble to learn the language even if\nthey marry a daughter of the soil. Their servants understand Spanish,\nand clandestinely watch the conversation and the actions, and become\nacquainted with all the secrets, of their indiscreet masters, to\nwhom the Filipinos remain an enigma which their conceit prevents them\nattempting to decipher.",
        "[Spanish lack of prestige deserved.] It is easy to understand how\nFilipino respect for Europeans must be diminished by the numbers of\nthese uneducated, improvident, and extravagant Spaniards, who, no\nmatter what may have been their position at home, are all determined\nto play the master in the colony. [Social Standing of Filipinos thus\nenhanced.] The relative standing of the Filipinos naturally profits\nby all this and it would be difficult to find a colony in which\nthe natives, taken all in all, feel more comfortable than in the\nPhilippines. They have adopted the religion, the manners, and the\ncustoms of their rulers; and though legally not on an equal footing\nwith the latter, they are by no means separated from them by the\nhigh barriers with which, not to mention Java, the churlish reserve\nof the English has surrounded the natives of the other colonies.",
        "[Spanish-Filipino bonds of union.] The same religion, a similar form\nof worship, an existence intermixed with that of the indigenous\npopulation, all tend to bring the Europeans and the Indians\ntogether. That they have done so is proved by the existence of the\nproportionately very numerous band of mestizos who inhabit the Islands.",
        "[Latin races better for colonists in the tropics.] The Spaniards\nand the Portuguese appear, in fact, to be the only Europeans who\ntake root in tropical countries. They are capable of permanent and\nfruitful amalgamation [52] with the natives. [53]",
        "[Initiative and individuality missing.] The want of originality, which\namong the mestizos, appears to arise from their equivocal position,\nis also to be found among the natives. Distinctly marked national\ncustoms, which one would naturally expect to find in such an isolated\npart of the world, are sought for in vain, and again and again the\nstranger remarks that everything has been learned and is only a veneer.",
        "[A compromise civilization.] As Spain forcibly expelled the\ncivilization of the Moors, and in Peru that of the Incas, so in the\nPhilippines it has understood how to set aside an equally well-founded\none, by appropriating in an incredible manner, in order to take root\nitself the more quickly, all existing forms and abuses. [54]",
        "[Imitation instilled and self-respect banished.] The uncivilized\ninhabitants of the Philippines quickly adopted the rites, forms,\nand ceremonies of the strange religion, and, at the same time, copied\nthe personal externalities of their new masters, learning to despise\ntheir own manners and customs as heathenish and barbarian. Nowadays,\nforsooth, they sing Andalusian songs, and dance Spanish dances; but\nin what sort of way? They imitate everything that passes before their\neyes without using their intelligence to appreciate it. It is this\nwhich makes both themselves and their artistic productions wearisome,\ndevoid of character, and, I may add, unnatural, in spite of the skill\nand patience they devote to them. These two peculiarities, moreover,\nare invariably to be found amongst nations whose civilization is but\nlittle developed; the patience so much admired is often nothing but\nwaste of time and breath, quite out of proportion to the end in view,\nand the skill is the mere consequence of the backward state of the\ndivision of labor.",
        "[Educated Filipino unnatural.] If I entered the house of a well-to-do\nFilipino, who spoke Spanish, I was received with the same phrases his\nmodel, a Spaniard, would employ; but I always had the feeling that it\nwas out of place. In countries where the native population remains\ntrue to its ancient customs this is not the case; and whenever I\nhave not been received with proper respect, I have remarked that the\napparent fact proceeded from a difference in social forms, not more\nto be wondered at than a difference in weights and measures. In Java,\nand particularly in Borneo and the Moluccas, the utensils in daily use\nare ornamented with so refined a feeling for form and color, that they\nare praised by our artists as patterns of ornamentation and afford\na proof that the labor is one of love, and that it is presided over\nby an acute intelligence. [Native art-sense spoiled.] Such a sense\nof beauty is seldom to be met with in the Philippines. Everything\nthere is imitation or careless makeshift. Even the piña embroideries,\nwhich are fabricated with such wonderful patience and skill, and\nare so celebrated for the fineness of the work, are, as a rule,\nspiritless imitations of Spanish patterns. One is involuntarily\nled to these conclusions by a comparison of the art products of the\nSpanish-American communities with those of more barbarous races. The\nBerlin Ethnographical Museum contains many proofs of the facts I have\njust mentioned.",
        "[Indolence from absence of incentive.] The oars used in the\nPhilippines are usually made of bamboo poles, with a board tied to\ntheir extremities with strips of rattan. If they happen to break, so\nmuch the better; for the fatiguing labor of rowing must necessarily\nbe suspended till they are mended again.",
        "[Carelessness from lack of responsibility.] In Java the carabao-carts,\nwhich are completely covered in as a protection against the rain,\nare ornamented with many tasteful patterns. The roofless wagons used\nin the Philippines are roughly put together at the last moment. When\nit is necessary to protect their contents from the wet, an old pair\nof mats is thrown over them, more for the purpose of appeasing the\nprejudices of the “Castilians” than really to keep off the rain.",
        "[Weakened character and want of dignity.] The English and the Dutch are\nalways looked upon as strangers in the tropics; their influence never\ntouches the ancient native customs which culminate in the religion of\nthe country. But the populations whom the Spaniards have converted to\ntheir religion have lost all originality, all sense of nationality;\nyet the alien religion has never really penetrated into their inmost\nbeing, they never feel it to be a source of moral support, and it is\nno accidental coincidence that they are all more or less stamped with\na want of dignity....",
        "[Spanish rule not benevolent, but beneficial.] With the exception of\nthis want of national individuality, and the loss of the distinguishing\nmanners and customs which constitute the chief charm of most eastern\npeoples, the Filipino is an interesting study of a type of mankind\nexisting in the easiest natural conditions. The arbitrary rule of\ntheir chiefs, and the iron shackles of slavery, were abolished by the\nSpaniards shortly after their arrival; and peace and security reigned\nin the place of war and rapine. The Spanish rule in these Islands was\nalways a mild one, not because the laws, which treated the natives\nlike children, were wonderfully gentle, but because the causes did\nnot exist which caused such scandalous cruelties in Spanish America\nand in the colonies of other nations.",
        "[Circumstances have favored the Filipinos.] It was fortunate for\nthe Filipinos that their islands possessed no wealth in the shape of\nprecious metals or valuable spices. In the earlier days of maritime\ntraffic there was little possibility of exporting the numerous\nagricultural productions of the colony; and it was scarcely worth\nwhile, therefore, to make the most of the land. The few Spaniards\nwho resided in the colony found such an easy method of making money\nin the commerce with China and Mexico, by means of the galleons,\nthat they held themselves aloof from all economical enterprises,\nwhich had little attraction for their haughty inclinations, and\nwould have imposed the severest labor on the Filipinos. Taking into\nconsideration the wearisome and dangerous navigation of the time,\nit was, moreover, impossible for the Spaniards, upon whom their too\nlarge possessions in America already imposed an exhausting man-tax,\nto maintain a strong armed force in the Philippines. The subjection,\nwhich had been inaugurated by a dazzling military exploit, was chiefly\naccomplished by the assistance of the friar orders, whose missionaries\nwere taught to employ extreme prudence and patience. The Philippines\nwere thus principally won by a peaceful conquest.",
        "[Have fared better than the Mexicans.] The taxes laid upon the peoples\nwere so trifling that they did not suffice for the administration\nof the colony. The difference was covered by yearly contributions\nfrom Mexico. The extortions of unconscientious officials were by no\nmeans conspicuous by their absence. Cruelties, however, such as were\npractised in the American mining districts, or in the manufactures\nof Quito, never occurred in the Philippines.",
        "[A land of opportunity.] Uncultivated land was free, and was at\nthe service of any one willing to make it productive; if, however,\nit remained untilled for two years, it reverted to the crown. [55]",
        "[Low taxes.] The only tax which the Filipinos pay is the poll-tax,\nknown as the tributo, which originally, three hundred years ago,\namounted to one dollar for every pair of adults, and in a country\nwhere all marry early, and the sexes are equally divided, really\nconstituted a family-tax. By degrees the tribute has been raised to\ntwo and one-sixteenth dollars. An adult, therefore, male or female,\npays one and one-thirty-second dollar, and that from his sixteenth to\nhis sixtieth year. Besides this, every man has to give forty days’\nlabor every year to the State. This vassalage (polos y servicios)\nis divided into ordinary and extraordinary services: the first\nconsists of the duties appertaining to a watchman or messenger, in\ncleaning the courts of justice, and in other light labors; the second\nin road-making, and similar heavier kinds of work, for the benefit\nof villages and provinces. The little use, however, that is made of\nthese services, is shown by the fact that any one can obtain a release\nfrom them for a sum which at most is not more than three dollars. No\npersonal service is required of women. A little further on, important\ndetails about the tax from official sources, which were placed at my\ndisposal in the colonial office, appear in a short special chapter.",
        "[Fortunate factors.] In other countries, with an equally mild climate,\nand an equally fertile soil, the natives, unless they had reached a\nhigher degree of civilization than that of the Philippine Islanders,\nwould have been ground down by native princes, or ruthlessly plundered\nand destroyed by foreigners. In these isolated Islands, so richly\nendowed by nature, where pressure from above, impulse from within,\nand every stimulus from the outside are wanting, the satisfaction\nof a few trifling wants is sufficient for an existence with ample\ncomfort. Of all countries in the world, the Philippines have the\ngreatest claim to be considered a lotos-eating Utopia. The traveller,\nwhose knowledge of the dolce far niente is derived from Naples,\nhas no real appreciation of it; it only blossoms under the shade of\npalm-trees. These notes of travel will contain plenty of examples to\nsupport this. One trip across the Pasig gives a foretaste of life\nin the interior of the country. Low wooden cabins and bamboo huts,\nsurmounted with green foliage and blossoming flowers, are picturesquely\ngrouped with areca palms, and tall, feather-headed bamboos, upon its\nbanks. Sometimes the enclosures run down into the stream itself, some\nof them being duck-grounds, and others bathing-places. The shore is\nfringed with canoes, nets, rafts, and fishing apparatus. Heavily-laden\nboats float down the stream, and small canoes ply from bank to bank\nbetween the groups of bathers. The most lively traffic is to be seen\nin the tiendas, large sheds, corresponding to the Javanese harongs,\nwhich open upon the river, the great channel for traffic.",
        "[River resorts.] They are a source of great attraction to the\npassing sailors, who resort to them for eating, drinking, and other\nconvivialities; and while away the time there in gambling, betel\nchewing, and smoking, with idle companions of both sexes.",
        "[Sleeping pilots.] At times somebody may be seen floating down\nthe stream asleep on a heap of coconuts. If the nuts run ashore,\nthe sleeper rouses himself, pushes off with a long bamboo, and\ncontentedly relapses into slumber, as his eccentric raft regains\nthe current of the river. One cut of his bolo-knife easily detaches\nsufficient of the husk of the nuts to allow of their being fastened\ntogether; in this way a kind of wreath is formed which encircles and\nholds together the loose nuts piled up in the middle.",
        "[Labor-saving conditions.] The arduous labors of many centuries\nhave left as their legacy a perfect system of transport; but in\nthese Islands man can obtain many of his requirements direct with\nproportionately trifling labor, and a large amount of comfort for\nhimself.",
        "[Easy food.] Off the Island of Talim, in the great Lagoon of Bay, my\nboatmen bought for a few cuartos several dozens of fish quite twelve\ninches long; and those which they couldn’t eat were split open, salted,\nand dried by a few hours’ exposure to the heat of the sun on the roof\nof the boat. When the fishermen had parted with their contemplated\nbreakfast, they stooped down and filled their cooking-vessels with\nsand-mussels (paludina costata, 2.a G.), first throwing away the\ndead ones from the handfuls they picked up from the bottom of the\nshallow water.",
        "[River’s importance.] Nearly all the dwellings are built by the water’s\nedge. The river is a natural self-maintaining highway, on which loads\ncan be carried to the foot of the mountains. The huts of the people,\nbuilt upon piles, are to be seen thickly scattered about its banks,\nand particularly about its broad mouths. The appropriateness of\ntheir position is evident, for the stream is at once the very\ncenter of activity and the most convenient spot for the pursuit\nof their callings. At each tide the takes of fish are more or less\nplentiful, and at low-water the women and children may be seen picking\nup shell-fish with their toes, for practice has enabled them to use\ntheir toes as deftly as their fingers, or gathering in the sand-crabs\nand eatable seaweed.",
        "[Riverside gaiety.]  The riverside is a pretty sight when men, women,\nand children are bathing and frolicking in the shade of the palm-trees;\nand others are filling their water-vessels, large bamboos, which they\ncarry on their shoulders, or jars, which they bear on their heads;\nand when the boys are standing upright on the broad backs of the\ncarabaos and riding triumphantly into the water.",
        "[Coco-palms.] It is here too that the coco-palm most flourishes, a tree\nthat supplies not only their food and drink, but also every material\nnecessary for the construction of huts and the manufacture of the\nvarious articles which they use. While the greatest care is necessary\nto make those growing further inland bear even a little fruit, the\npalm-trees close to the shore, even when planted on wretched soil,\ngrow plentiful crops without the slightest trouble. Has a palm-tree\never been made to blossom in a hothouse? Thomson [56] mentions that\ncoco-trees growing by the sea-side are wont to incline their stems over\nthe ocean, the waters of which bear their fruit to desert shores and\nislands, and render them habitable for mankind. Thus the coco-tree\nwould seem to play an essential part in the ocean vagabondage of\nMalaysia and Polynesia.",
        "[Nipa-palms.] Close to the coco-trees grow clumps of the stunted\nnipa-palms, which only flourish in brackish waters; [57] their\nleaves furnish the best roof-thatching. Sugar, brandy, and vinegar\nare manufactured from their sap. Three hundred and fifty years ago\nPigafetta found these manufactures in full swing, but nowadays\nthey seem to be limited to the Philippines. Besides these, the\npandanus-tree, from the leaves of which the softest mats are woven,\nis always found in near proximity to the shore.",
        "[Fertile fields.] Towards the interior the landscape is covered with\nrice-fields, which yearly receive a fresh layer of fertile soil,\nwashed down from the mountains by the river, and spread over their\nsurface by the overflowing of its waters; and which in consequence\nnever require any fertilizer. [The carabao.] The carabao, the favorite\ndomestic animal of the Malays, and which they keep especially for\nagricultural purposes, prefers these regions to all others. It loves\nto wallow in the mud, and is not fit for work unless permitted to\nfrequent the water.",
        "[Bamboo.] Bamboos with luxuriant leafy tops grow plentifully by the\nhuts in the rice-fields which fringe the banks of the river. In my\nformer sketches of travel I have endeavored to describe how much\nthis gigantic plant contributes to the comfort and convenience of\ntropical life. Since then I have become acquainted with many curious\npurposes to which it is turned, but to describe them here would be\nout of place.  [58] I may be allowed, however, to briefly cite a\nfew examples showing what numerous results are obtained from simple\nmeans. Nature has endowed these splendid plants, which perhaps surpass\nall others in beauty, with so many useful qualities, and delivered\nthem into the hands of mankind so ready for immediate use, that a\nfew sharp cuts suffice to convert them into all kinds of various\nutensils. [Strength.] The bamboo possesses, in proportion to its\nlightness, an extraordinary strength; the result of its round shape,\nand the regularity of the joints in its stem. The parallel position and\ntoughness of its fibers render it easy to split, and, when split, its\npieces are of extraordinary pliability and elasticity. To the gravelly\nsoil on which it grows it owes its durability, and its firm, even,\nand always clean surface, the brilliancy and color of which improve by\nuse. [Convenience.] And finally, it is a great thing for a population\nwith such limited means of conveyance that the bamboo is to be found\nin such abundance in all kinds of localities and of all dimensions,\nfrom a few millimeters to ten or fifteen centimeters in diameter,\neven sometimes to twice this amount; and that, on account of its\nunsurpassed floating power, it is pre-eminently fitted for locomotion\nin a country poor in roads but rich in watercourses. A blow with a bolo\nis generally enough to cut down a strong stem. [Usefulness.] If the\nthin joints are taken away, hollow stems of different thicknesses can\nbe slid into one another like the parts of a telescope. From bamboos\nsplit in half, gutters, troughs, and roofing tiles can be made. Split\ninto several slats, which can be again divided into small strips and\nfibers for the manufacture of baskets, ropes, mats, and fine plaiting\nwork, they can be made into frames and stands. Two cuts in the same\nplace make a round hole through which a stem of corresponding diameter\ncan be firmly introduced. If a similar opening is made in a second\nupright, the horizontal stem can be run through both. Gates, closing\nperpendicularly or horizontally in frames moving without friction on\na perpendicular or horizontal axis, can be made in this way.",
        "Two deep cuts give an angular shape to the stem; and when its two sides\nare wide enough apart to admit of a cross-stem being placed between\nthem, they can be employed as roof-ridges or for the framework of\ntables and chairs; a quantity of flat split pieces of bamboo being\nfastened on top of them with chair-cane. These split pieces then\nform the seats of the chairs and the tops of the tables, instead of\nthe boards and large bamboo laths used at other times. It is equally\neasy to make an oblong opening in a large bamboo in which to fit the\nlaths of a stand.",
        "A couple of cuts are almost enough to make a fork, a pair of tongs\nor a hook.",
        "If one makes a hole as big as the end of one’s finger in a large\nbamboo close under a joint, one obtains by fastening a small piece of\ncloth to the open end, a syphon or a filter. If a piece of bamboo is\nsplit down to the joint in strips, and the strips be bound together\nwith others horizontally interlaced, it makes a conical basket. If\nthe strips are cut shorter, it makes a peddler’s pack basket. If\na long handle is added, and it is filled with tar, it can be used\nas a signal torch. If shallower baskets of the same dimensions,\nbut with their bottoms cut off or punched out, are placed inside\nthese conical ones, the two together make capital snare baskets for\ncrabs and fish. If a bamboo stem be cut off just below the joint,\nand its lower edge be split up into a cogged rim, it makes, when the\npartition of the joint is punched out, an earth-auger, a fountain-pipe,\nand many things of the kind.",
        "[Pleasures of travel.] Strangers travelling in the interior have\ndaily fresh opportunities of enjoying the hospitality of nature. The\natmosphere is so equitably warm that one would gladly dispense with\nall clothing except a sun-hat and a pair of light shoes. Should one\nbe tempted to pass the night in the open air, the construction of a\nhut from the leaves of the palm and the fern is the work of a few\nminutes; [Village rest houses.] but in even the smallest village\nthe traveller finds a “common house” (casa real), in which he can\ntake up his quarters and be supplied with the necessaries of life\nat the market price. There too he will always meet with semaneros\n(those who perform menial duties) ready to serve him as messengers\nor porters for the most trifling remuneration. But long practice\nhas taught me that their services principally consist in doing\nnothing. On one occasion I wanted to send a man who was playing\ncards and drinking tuba (fresh or weakly-fermented palm-sap) with his\ncompanions, on an errand. [Pleasant prison life.] Without stopping his\ngame the fellow excused himself on the ground of being a prisoner,\nand one of his guardians proceeded in the midst of the intense heat\nto carry my troublesome message. Prisoners have certainly little\ncause to grumble. [Frequent floggings little regarded.] The only\ninconvenience to which they are exposed are the floggings which the\nlocal authorities very liberally dispense by the dozens for the most\ntrifling offences. Except the momentary bodily pain, however, these\nappear in most cases to make little impression on a people who have\nbeen accustomed to corporal punishment from their youth upwards. Their\nacquaintances stand round the sufferers, while the blows are being\ninflicted, and mockingly ask them how it tastes.",
        "[Change from Malayan character.] A long residence amongst the earnest,\nquiet, and dignified Malays, who are most anxious for their honor,\nwhile most submissive to their superiors, makes the contrast in\ncharacter exhibited by the natives of the Philippines, who yet belong\nto the Malay race, all the more striking. The change in their nature\nappears to be a natural consequence of the Spanish rule, for the same\ncharacteristics may be observed in the natives of Spanish America. The\nclass distinctions and the despotic oppression prevalent under their\nformer chiefs doubtless rendered the Filipinos of the past more like\nthe Malays of today.",
