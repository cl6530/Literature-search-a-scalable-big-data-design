        "Arthur ended his far from orderly retreat at the Auditorium, and in the\nsitting room of his suite there set about re-forming his lines, with some\nvague idea of making another attack later in the day–one less timid and\nblundering. “I’d better not have gone near her,” said he disgustedly.\n“How could a man win when he feels beaten before he begins?” He was not\nnow hazed by Janet’s beauty and her voice like bells in evening quiet,\nand her mystic ideas. Youth, rarely wise in action, is often wise in\nthought; and Arthur, having a reasoning apparatus that worked uncommonly\nwell when he set it in motion and did not interfere with it, was soon\nseeing his situation as a whole much as it was–ugly, mocking, hopeless.",
        "“Maybe Janet knows the real reason why she’s acting this way, maybe she\ndon’t,” thought he, with the disposition of the inexperienced to give the\nbenefit of even imaginary doubt. “No matter; the fact is, it’s all up\nbetween us.” This finality, unexpectedly staring at him, gave him a\nshock. “Why,” he muttered, “she really has thrown me over! All her talk\nwas a blind–a trick.” And, further exhibiting his youth in holding the\nindividual responsible for the system of which the individual is merely a\nvictim, usually a pitiable victim, he went to the opposite extreme and\nfell to denouncing her–cold-hearted and mercenary like her mother, a\ncoward as well as a hypocrite–for, if she had had any of the bravery of\nself-respect, wouldn’t she have been frank with him? He reviewed her in\nthe flooding new light upon her character, this light that revealed her\nas mercilessly as flash of night-watchman’s lantern on guilty, shrinking\nform. “She–Why, she always was a fakir!” he exclaimed, stupefied by\nthe revelation of his own lack of discernment, he who had prided himself\non his acuteness, especially as to women. “From childhood up, she has\nalways made herself comfortable, no matter who was put out; she has\ngotten whatever she wanted, always pretending to be unselfish, always\nmaking it look as if the other person were in the wrong.” There he\nstarted up in the rate of the hoodwinked, at the recollection of an\nincident of the previous summer–how she had been most gracious to a\nyoung French nobleman, in America in search of a wife; how anybody but\n“spiritual” Janet would have been accused of outrageous flirting–no, not\naccused, but convicted. He recalled a vague story which he had set down\nto envious gossip–a story that the Frenchman had departed on learning\nthat Charles Whitney had not yet reached the stage of fashionable\neducation at which the American father appreciates titles and begins to\nlisten without losing his temper when the subject of settlements is\nbroached. He remembered now that Janet had been low-spirited for some\ntime after the Frenchman took himself and title and eloquent eyes and\n“soulful, stimulating conversation” to another market. “What a damn fool\nI’ve been!” Arthur all but shouted at his own image in a mirror which by\nchance was opposite him. A glance, and his eyes shifted; somehow, it gave\nhim no pleasure, but the reverse, to see that handsome face and\nwell-set-up, well-dressed figure.",
        "“She was marrying me for money,” he went on, when he had once more seated\nhimself, legs crossed and cigarette going reflectively. The idea seemed\nnew to him–that people with money could marry for money, just as a\ncapitalist goes only where he hopes to increase his capital. But on\nexamining it more closely, he was surprised to find that it was not new\nat all. “What am I so virtuous about?” said he. “Wasn’t I after money,\ntoo? If our circumstances were reversed, what would I be doing?” He\ncould find but one honest answer. “No doubt I’d be trying to get out of\nit, and if I didn’t, it’d be because I couldn’t see or make a way.” To\nhis abnormally sensitized nerves the whole business began to exude a\ndistinct, nauseating odor. “Rotten–that’s the God’s truth,” thought he.\n“Father was right!”",
        "But there he drew back; he must be careful not to let anger sweep him\ninto conceding too much. “No–life’s got to be lived as the world\ndictates,” he hastened to add. “I see now why father did it, but he went\ntoo far. He forgot my rights. The money is mine. And, by God, I’ll get\nit!” And again he started up; and again he was caught and put out of\ncountenance by his own image in the mirror. He turned away, shamefaced,\nbut sullenly resolute.",
        "Base? He couldn’t deny it. But he was desperate; also, he had been too\nlong accustomed to grabbing things to which his conscience told him he\nhad doubtful right or none. “It’s mine. I’ve been cheated out of it. I’ll\nget it. Besides–” His mind suddenly cleared of the shadow of shame–\"I\nowe it to mother and Del to make the fight. They’ve been cheated, too.\nBecause they’re too soft-hearted and too reverent of father’s memory, is\nthat any reason, any excuse, for my shirking my duty by them? If father\nwere here to speak, I know he’d approve.” Before him rose the frightful\nlook in his father’s eyes in the earlier stage of that second and last\nillness. ’That’s what the look meant!” he cried, now completely\njustified. “He recovered his reason. He wanted to undo the mischief that\nold sneak Hargrave had drawn him into!”",
        "The case was complete: His father had been insane when he made the will,\nhad repented afterward, but had been unable to unmake it; his only son\nArthur Ranger, now head of the family, owed it to the family’s future and\nto its two helpless and oversentimental women to right the wrong. A\ncomplete case, a clear case, a solemn mandate. Interest and duty were\nsynonymous–as always to ingenious minds.",
        "He lost no time in setting about this newly discovered high task of love\nand justice. Within twenty minutes he was closeted with Dawson of the\ngreat law firm, Mitchell, Dawson, Vance & Bischoffsheimer, who had had\nthe best seats on all the fattest stranded carcasses of the Middle West\nfor a decade–that is, ever since Bischoffsheimer joined the firm and\ntaught its intellects how on a vast scale to transubstantiate technically\nlegal knowledge into technically legal wealth. Dawson–lean and keen,\ntough and brown of skin, and so carelessly dressed that he looked as if\nhe slept in his clothes–listened with the sympathetic, unwandering\nattention which men give only him who comes telling where and how they\ncan make money. The young man ended his story, all in a glow of\nenthusiasm for his exalted motives and of satisfaction with his eloquence\nin presenting them; then came the shrewd and thorough cross-examination\nwhich, he believed, strengthened every point he had made.",
        "“On your showing,” was Dawson’s cautious verdict, “you seem to have a\ncase. But you must not forget that judges and juries have a deep\nprejudice against breaking wills. They’re usually fathers themselves, and\nguard the will as the parent’s strongest weapon in keeping the children\nin order after they’re too old for the strap or the bed slat, as the case\nmay be. Undue influence or mental infirmity must be mighty clearly\nproven. Even then the court may decide to let the will stand, on general\nprinciples. Your mother and sister, of course, join you?”",
        "“I–I hope so,” hesitated Arthur. “I’m not sure.” More self-possessedly:\n“You know how it is with women–with ladies–how they shrink from\nnotoriety.”",
        "“No, I can’t say I do,” said Dawson dryly. “Ladies need money even more\nthan women do, and so they’ll usually go the limit, and beyond, to get\nit. However, assuming that for some reason or other, your mother and\nsister won’t help, at least they won’t oppose?”",
        "“My sister is engaged to the son of Dr. Hargrave,” said Arthur uneasily.",
        "“That’s good–excellent!” exclaimed Dawson, rubbing his gaunt,\nbeard-discolored jaw vigorously.",
        "“But–he–Theodore Hargrave is a sentimental, unpractical chap.”",
        "“So are we all–but not in money matters.”",
        "“He’s an exception, I’m afraid,” said Arthur. “Really–I think it’s\nalmost certain he’ll try to influence her to take sides against me. And\nmy mother was very bitter when I spoke of contest. But, as I’ve shown\nyou, my case is quite apart from what they may or may not do.”",
        "“Um–um,” grunted Dawson. He threw himself back in his chair; to aid him\nin thinking, he twisted the only remaining crown-lock of his gray-black\nhair, and slowly drew his thin lips from his big sallow teeth, and as\nslowly returned them to place. “Obviously,” he said at length, “the\ndoctor is the crucial witness. We must see to it that\"–a significant\ngrin–\"that the other side does not attach him. We must anticipate them\nby attaching him to us. I’ll see what can be done–legitimately, you\nunderstand. Perhaps you may have to engage additional counsel–some such\nfirm as, say, Humperdink & Grafter. Often, in cases nowadays, there is\ndetail work of an important character that lawyers of our standing\ncouldn’t think of undertaking. But, of course, we work in harmony with\nsuch other counsel as our client sees fit to engage.”",
        "“Certainly; I understand,” said Arthur, with a knowing,\n“man-of-the-world” nod. His cause being good and its triumph necessary,\nhe must not be squeamish about any alliances it might be necessary to\nmake as a means to that triumph, where the world was so wicked. “Then,\nyou undertake the case.”",
        "“We will look into it,” Dawson corrected. “You appreciate that the\nlitigation will be somewhat expensive?”",
        "Arthur reddened. No, he hadn’t thought of that! Whenever he had wanted\nanything, he had ordered it, and had let the bill go to his father;\nwhenever he had wanted money, he had sent to his father for it, and had\ngot it. Dawson’s question made the reality of his position–moneyless,\nresourceless, friendless–burst over him like a waterspout. Dawson saw\nand understood; but it was not his cue to lessen that sense of\nhelplessness.",
        "At last Arthur sufficiently shook off his stupor to say: “Unless I win\nthe contest, I shan’t have any resources beyond the five thousand I get\nunder the will, and a thousand or so I have in bank at Saint X–and what\nlittle I could realize from my personal odds and ends. Isn’t there some\nway the thing could be arranged?”",
        "“There is the method of getting a lawyer to take a case on contingent\nfee,” said Dawson. “That is, the lawyer gets a certain per cent of what\nhe wins, and nothing if he loses. But we don’t make such arrangements.\nThey are regarded as almost unprofessional; I couldn’t honestly recommend\nany lawyer who would. But, let me see–um–urn–” Dawson was reflecting\nagain, with an ostentation which might have roused the suspicions of a\nless guileless person than Arthur Ranger at twenty-five. “You could,\nperhaps, give us a retainer of say, a thousand in cash?”",
        "“Yes,” said Arthur, relieved. He thought he saw light ahead.",
        "“Then we could take your note for say, five thousand–due in eighteen\nmonths. You could renew it, if your victory was by any chance delayed\nbeyond that time.”",
        "“Your victory” was not very adroit, but it was adroit enough to bedazzle\nArthur. “Certainly,” said he gratefully.",
        "Dawson shut his long, wild-looking teeth and gently drew back his dry,\nbeard-discolored lips, while his keen eyes glinted behind his spectacles.\nThe fly had a leg in the web!",
        "Business being thus got into a smooth way, Dawson and Arthur became great\nfriends. Nothing that Dawson said was a specific statement of belief in\nthe ultimate success of the suit; but his every look and tone implied\nconfidence. Arthur went away with face radiant and spirit erect. He felt\nthat he was a man of affairs, a man of consequence, he had lawyers, and a\nbig suit pending; and soon he would be rich. He thought of Janet, and\naudibly sneered. “I’ll make the Whitneys sick of their treachery!” said\nhe. Back had come his sense of strength and superiority; and once more he\nwas “gracious” with servants and with such others of the “peasantry” as\nhappened into or near his homeward path.",
        "Toward three o’clock that afternoon, as he was being whirled toward Saint\nX in the Eastern Express, his lawyer was in the offices of Ramsay &\nVanorden, a rival firm of wreckers and pirate outfitters on the third\nfloor of the same building. When Dawson had despatched his immediate\nbusiness with Vanorden, he lingered to say: “Well, I reckon we’ll soon be\nlined up on opposite sides in another big suit.”",
        "Confidences between the two firms were frequent and natural–not only\nbecause Vanorden and Dawson were intimate friends and of the greatest\nassistance each to the other socially and politically; not only because\nRamsay and Bischoffsheimer had married sisters; but also, and chiefly,\nbecause big lawyers like to have big lawyers opposed to them in a big\nsuit. For several reasons; for instance, ingenuity on each side prolongs\nthe litigation and makes it intricate, and therefore highly expensive,\nand so multiplies the extent of the banquet.",
        "“How so?” inquired Vanorden, put on the alert by the significant\nintonation of his friend.",
        "“The whole Ranger-Whitney business is coming into court. Ranger, you\nknow, passed over the other day. He cut his family off with almost\nnothing–gave his money to Tecumseh College. The son’s engaged us to\nattack the will.”",
        "“Where do we come in?” asked Vanorden.",
        "Dawson laughed and winked. “I guess your client, old Charley Whitney,\nwon’t miss the chance to intervene in the suit and annex the whole\nbusiness, in the scrimmage.”",
        "Vanorden nodded. “Oh, I see,” said he. “I see! Yes, we’ll take a\nhand–sure!”",
        "“There won’t be much in it for us,” continued Dawson. “The boy’s got\nnothing, and between you and me, Len, the chances are against him. But\nyou fellows and whoever gets the job of defending the college’s rights–\"\nDawson opened his arms and made a humorous, huge, in-sweeping gesture.\n“And,” he added, “Whitney’s one of the trustees under the will. See?”",
        "“Thanks, old man.” Vanorden was laughing like a shrewd and mischievous\nbut through-and-through good-natured boy. The two brilliant young leaders\nof the Illinois bar shook hands warmly.",
        "And so it came about that Charles Whitney was soon indorsing a plan to\ncause, and to profit by, sly confusion–the plan of his able lawyers.\nThey had for years steered his hardy craft, now under the flag of\npeaceful commerce and now under the black banner of the buccaneer. The\nbest of pilots, they had enabled him to clear many a shoal of bankruptcy,\nmany a reef of indictment. They served well, for he paid well.",
