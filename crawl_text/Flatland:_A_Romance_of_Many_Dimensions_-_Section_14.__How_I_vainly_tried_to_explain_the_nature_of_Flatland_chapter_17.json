        "\nThinking that it was time to bring down the Monarch from his raptures\nto the level of common sense, I determined to endeavour to\nopen up to him some glimpses of the truth, that is to say\nof the nature of things in Flatland.  So I began thus:\n“How does your Royal Highness distinguish the shapes and positions\nof his subjects?  I for my part noticed by the sense of sight,\nbefore I entered your Kingdom, that some of your people are Lines\nand others Points, and that some of the Lines are larger --\"\n“You speak of an impossibility,” interrupted the King;\n“you must have seen a vision; for to detect the difference between\na Line and a Point by the sense of sight is, as every one knows,\nin the nature of things, impossible; but it can be detected by\nthe sense of hearing, and by the same means my shape can be\nexactly ascertained.  Behold me — I am a Line, the longest\nin Lineland, over six inches of Space --”  “Of Length”,\nI ventured to suggest.  “Fool,” said he, “Space is Length.\nInterrupt me again, and I have done.”",
        "I apologized; but he continued scornfully, “Since you are impervious\nto argument, you shall hear with your ears how by means of\nmy two voices I reveal my shape to my Wives, who are at this moment\nsix thousand miles seventy yards two feet eight inches away, the one\nto the North, the other to the South.  Listen, I call to them.”",
        "He chirruped, and then complacently continued:  “My wives at this\nmoment receiving the sound of one of my voices, closely followed by\nthe other, and perceiving that the latter reaches them after\nan interval in which sound can traverse 6.457 inches, infer that one\nof my mouths is 6.457 inches further from them than the other,\nand accordingly know my shape to be 6.457 inches.  But you will\nof course understand that my wives do not make this calculation\nevery time they hear my two voices.  They made it, once for all,\nbefore we were married.  But they COULD make it at any time.\nAnd in the same way I can estimate the shape of any of\nmy Male subjects by the sense of sound.”",
        "“But how,” said I, “if a Man feigns a Woman’s voice with one of\nhis two voices, or so disguises his Southern voice that it cannot\nbe recognized as the echo of the Northern?  May not such deceptions\ncause great inconvenience?  And have you no means of checking frauds\nof this kind by commanding your neighbouring subjects to feel\none another?”  This of course was a very stupid question,\nfor feeling could not have answered the purpose; but I asked\nwith the view of irritating the Monarch, and I succeeded perfectly.",
        "“What!” cried he in horror, “explain your meaning.”  “Feel, touch,\ncome into contact,” I replied.  “If you mean by FEELING,\"\nsaid the King, “approaching so close as to leave no space\nbetween two individuals, know, Stranger, that this offence\nis punishable in my dominions by death.  And the reason is obvious.\nThe frail form of a Woman, being liable to be shattered\nby such an approximation, must be preserved by the State;\nbut since Women cannot be distinguished by the sense of sight\nfrom Men, the Law ordains universally that neither Man nor Woman\nshall be approached so closely as to destroy the interval\nbetween the approximator and the approximated.",
        "“And indeed what possible purpose would be served by this illegal\nand unnatural excess of approximation which you call TOUCHING,\nwhen all the ends of so brutal and coarse a process are attained\nat once more easily and more exactly by the sense of hearing?\nAs to your suggested danger of deception, it is non-existent:\nfor the Voice, being the essence of one’s Being, cannot be thus\nchanged at will.  But come, suppose that I had the power of passing\nthrough solid things, so that I could penetrate my subjects,\none after another, even to the number of a billion, verifying the size\nand distance of each by the sense of FEELING:  how much time\nand energy would be wasted in this clumsy and inaccurate method!\nWhereas now, in one moment of audition, I take as it were the census\nand statistics, local, corporeal, mental and spiritual,\nof every living being in Lineland.  Hark, only hark!”",
        "So saying he paused and listened, as if in an ecstasy,\nto a sound which seemed to me no better than a tiny chirping\nfrom an innumerable multitude of lilliputian grasshoppers.",
        "“Truly,” replied I, “your sense of hearing serves you in good stead,\nand fills up many of your deficiencies.  But permit me to point out\nthat your life in Lineland must be deplorably dull.  To see nothing\nbut a Point!  Not even to be able to contemplate a Straight Line!\nNay, not even to know what a Straight Line is!  To see, yet be cut off\nfrom those Linear prospects which are vouchsafed to us in Flatland!\nBetter surely to have no sense of sight at all than to see so little!\nI grant you I have not your discriminative faculty of hearing;\nfor the concert of all Lineland which gives you such intense pleasure,\nis to me no better than a multitudinous twittering or chirping.\nBut at least I can discern, by sight, a Line from a Point.\nAnd let me prove it.  Just before I came into your kingdom,\nI saw you dancing from left to right, and then from right to left,\nwith Seven Men and a Woman in your immediate proximity on the left,\nand eight Men and two Women on your right.  Is not this correct?”",
        "“It is correct,” said the King, “so far as the numbers and sexes\nare concerned, though I know not what you mean by ’right’ and ’left’.\nBut I deny that you saw these things.  For how could you see the Line,\nthat is to say the inside, of any Man?  But you must have\nheard these things, and then dreamed that you saw them.\nAnd let me ask what you mean by those words ’left’ and ’right’.\nI suppose it is your way of saying Northward and Southward.”",
        "“Not so,” replied I; “besides your motion of Northward and Southward,\nthere is another motion which I call from right to left.”",
        "KING.  Exhibit to me, if you please, this motion from left to right.",
        "I.  Nay, that I cannot do, unless you could step out\nof your Line altogether.",
        "KING.  Out of my Line?  Do you mean out of the world?  Out of Space?",
        "I.  Well, yes.  Out of YOUR World.  Out of YOUR Space.\nFor your Space is not the true Space.  True Space is a Plane;\nbut your Space is only a Line.",
        "KING.  If you cannot indicate this motion from left to right by\nyourself moving in it, then I beg you to describe it to me in words.",
        "I.  If you cannot tell your right side from your left,\nI fear that no words of mine can make my meaning clear to you.\nBut surely you cannot be ignorant of so simple a distinction.",
        "KING.  I do not in the least understand you.",
        "I.  Alas!  How shall I make it clear?  When you move straight on,\ndoes it not sometimes occur to you that you COULD move\nin some other way, turning your eye round so as to look\nin the direction towards which your side is now fronting?\nIn other words, instead of always moving in the direction\nof one of your extremities, do you never feel a desire to move\nin the direction, so to speak, of your side?",
        "KING.  Never.  And what do you mean?  How can a man’s inside\n“front” in any direction?  Or how can a man move in the direction\nof his inside?",
        "I.  Well then, since words cannot explain the matter,\nI will try deeds, and will move gradually out of Lineland\nin the direction which I desire to indicate to you.",
        "At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland.\nAs long as any part of me remained in his dominion and in his view,\nthe King kept exclaiming, “I see you, I see you still;\nyou are not moving.”  But when I had at last moved myself\nout of his Line, he cried in his shrillest voice, “She is vanished;\nshe is dead.”  “I am not dead,” replied I; “I am simply\nout of Lineland, that is to say, out of the Straight Line\nwhich you call Space, and in the true Space, where I can see things\nas they are.  And at this moment I can see your Line, or side —\nor inside as you are pleased to call it; and I can see also the Men\nand Women on the North and South of you, whom I will now enumerate,\ndescribing their order, their size, and the interval between each.”",
        "Illustration 7",
        "When I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly,\n“Does that at last convince you?”  And, with that, I once more\nentered Lineland, taking up the same position as before.",
        "But the Monarch replied, “If you were a Man of sense — though,\nas you appear to have only one voice I have little doubt\nyou are not a Man but a Woman — but, if you had a particle of sense,\nyou would listen to reason.  You ask me to believe that there is\nanother Line besides that which my senses indicate, and another motion\nbesides that of which I am daily conscious.  I, in return,\nask you to describe in words or indicate by motion that other Line\nof which you speak.  Instead of moving, you merely exercise\nsome magic art of vanishing and returning to sight; and instead of\nany lucid description of your new World, you simply tell me\nthe numbers and sizes of some forty of my retinue, facts known\nto any child in my capital.  Can anything be more irrational\nor audacious?  Acknowledge your folly or depart from my dominions.”",
        "Furious at his perversity, and especially indignant that he professed\nto be ignorant of my sex, I retorted in no measured terms,\n“Besotted Being!  You think yourself the perfection of existence,\nwhile you are in reality the most imperfect and imbecile.\nYou profess to see, whereas you can see nothing but a Point!\nYou plume yourself on inferring the existence of a Straight Line;\nbut I CAN SEE Straight Lines, and infer the existence of Angles,\nTriangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and even Circles.\nWhy waste more words?  Suffice it that I am the completion\nof your incomplete self.  You are a Line, but I am a Line of Lines,\ncalled in my country a Square:  and even I, infinitely superior\nthough I am to you, am of little account among the great nobles\nof Flatland, whence I have come to visit you, in the hope of\nenlightening your ignorance.”",
        "Hearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry\nas if to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same moment\nthere arose from myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry,\nincreasing in vehemence till at last methought it rivalled\nthe roar of an army of a hundred thousand Isosceles, and the artillery\nof a thousand Pentagons.  Spell-bound and motionless,\nI could neither speak nor move to avert the impending destruction;\nand still the noise grew louder, and the King came closer,\nwhen I awoke to find the breakfast-bell recalling me to\nthe realities of Flatland.",
