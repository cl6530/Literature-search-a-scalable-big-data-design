        "“But, sir,” you demand, “can you tell us something more about\nOdd-Fellowship, its purposes and its Work?”  I can, a little.  Come\nwith me, then, and we will look into the lodge.  Ah!  In the most\nconspicuous place there stands an altar–upon it the open Bible, the\nworld’s great word of Life and Light.  Upon the principles enunciated\nby that Book, largely rests the great superstructure of Odd-Fellowship.\nThe Bible is to the order what the sun is to the material universe–its\nilluminator and vivifier, even as it also is the, guide to faith and\npractice.  A man may neglect his closet, his church, his Bible, but\nwhen he enters the lodge he is bound to listen to the voice of his\nMaker, as it thunders from His word; and while the lodge does by no\nmeans lay claim to the possession of religious attributes, yet has it\nbeen the means, by the constant use of the Bible, of turning many from\nthe ways of wrong-doing and sin, into paths of pleasantness and peace;\nand by a unique system of symbolism and a comprehensive and practical\napplication of its sublime truths, the faith of the believer has been\nstrengthened, enlarged and rendered usefully active.",
        "Odd-Fellowship’s plan of benefaction addresses itself to the physical\nas well as the moral nature, and, reaching out from its immediate\nsubjects, permeates by natural affinity every sphere in which active\nsympathy may be invoked.  Its mission and its results are not only\nactive and substantial, but often so effective by its consequential or\nindirect influence as to penetrate entire communities.  In this\nconnection I will say Odd-Fellowship is not a religious organization.\nOur work pertains particularly to this life, educating the heart of man\nto practical beneficence, alleviating the sufferings of humanity and\nelevating the character of man.  Odd-Fellowship was not organized for\nthe purpose of ridding the world of all its sorrows, but to ameliorate\nand to soften the suffering to which the human family is heir.  It is\nan association of men who have united themselves for the purpose of\nsmoothing the ragged edge of want, and extending to those who are bound\ndown by the iron bands of misfortune a helping hand.  Odd-Fellowship\nholds no affinity with the classifications or distinctions of society,\nbut dispenses charity to all alike.  It does not array itself against\nthe church, nor presume to arrogate its functions, or to supervise its\nteachings.  Its lodges are not the council rooms of enmity to\nreligious, civil, moral or social organizations.  Far otherwise; all\nits oracles and instructions in relation to these grave subjects find\ntheir warrant and authority in the divine law, under the inspiration of\nwhich it proclaims the Golden Rule as the sublimest illustration of the\nlaw of love.  Odd-Fellowship keeps a close watch over its subjects, and\nconstantly impresses upon their minds the fact that their hearts must\nnot foster evil, the progenitor of crime, or hatred and vice, whose\nevil consequences must continue to afflict mankind until the coming of\nthat time to which hope looks forward with ardent joy, when one law\nshall bind all nations, tongues and kindred of the earth, and that law\nwill be the law of ’Universal Brotherhood.”  Odd-Fellowship also\nteaches us that we are never to judge a man by his outward appearance.\nA man’s form may be clothed with rags, his hands may be rough and hard,\nhis cheeks may be browned by the rays of summer’s sun; yet underneath\nall this there may be an honest heart.  If so, we take him by the hand\nand call him brother.  Odd-Fellowship teaches equality; we must meet\nupon one common level.  The brother who lives in the rough log cabin\nenjoys the same right and privileges as the monarch on his throne.  We\nlive, we move and have our being, and are indebted for all things to\nthe One Great Ruler of the Universe–God.  All persons are desirous of\nbeing happy, and happiness is sought for in various ways.\nOdd-Fellowship teaches that man is responsible for his own misery.  I\nbelieve that no mere misfortune can ever call for exceeding bitter\nsorrow.  As long as man preserves himself from contamination of that\nwhich is evil and foul, he can not reach any very low depth of woe.  By\nhis own act, by his own voluntary desertion of the true aim of life,\nand by that alone, is it possible that a man should drink his cup of\nmisery to the dregs.  The want of happiness, so prevalent, is thus the\nnatural consequence of the inherent blindness of men.  By it they are\nled to pursue eagerly the phantom of wealth, rank, power, etc.,\nwhite neglecting that which alone can satisfy the wants of the soul.\nIf men could really know what is their chief good, we should no longer\nhear on every hand prayers offered up for those idle accoutrements of\nlife, which may indeed be enjoyed, but often bring only\ndissatisfaction, and can be dispensed with without inconvenience to\nmankind.",
        "Many persons say Odd-Fellowship is contrary to the teachings of the\nBible.  The way such people read their Bible is just like the way that\nthe old monks thought hedgehogs ate grapes.  They rolled themselves\nover and over where the grapes lay on the ground.  What fruit stuck to\ntheir spines they carried off and ate.  So your hedgehoggy readers roll\nthemselves over and over their Bibles and declare that whatever sticks\nto their spines is Scripture and that nothing else is.  But you can\nonly get the skins of the texts that way.  If you want their juice you\nmust press them in cluster.  Now the clustered texts about the human\nheart insist as a body, not on any inherent corruption in all hearts,\nbut on the terrific distinction between the bad and the good ones.  “A\ngood man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that\nwhich is good, and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth\nforth that which is evil.”",
        "“They on the rock are they which, in an honest and good heart, having\nheard the word, kept it.”",
        "“Delight thyself in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of\nthine heart.  The wicked have bent their bow that they may privily\nshoot at him that is upright in heart.”  For all of us, the question is\nnot at all to ascertain how much or how little corruption there is in\nhuman nature, but to ascertain whether, out of all the mass of that\nnature, we are the sheep or the goat breed; whether we are people of\nupright heart being shot at, or people of crooked heart doing the\nshooting.",
        "And of all the texts bearing on the subject, this, which is a quite\nsimple and practical order, is the one you have chiefly to hold in\nmind: “Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues\nof life.”",
        "The will of God respecting us is, that we shall live by each others\nhappiness and life; not by each others misery or death.",
        "Men help each other by their joy, not by their sorrow.  There is but\none way in which man can ever help God–that is, by letting God help\nhim.",
        "A little boy, who had often heard his father pray for the poor, that\nthey might be clothed and fed, interrupted him one day by saying,\n“Father, if you will give me the key to your corn crib and wheat bin, I\nwill answer some of your prayers.”",
        "Ah! my friends, always keep in mind this truth, “One hour of justice is\nworth seventy years of prayer.”",
        "Call not this, then, a Godless institution, rioting in selfishness and\ninfidelity, as it has been denominated by certain super-excellent\nChristians, who appear to have fully persuaded themselves that no good\ncan possibly come from such a Nazareth.  For, with the constant and\nunvarying light of the Holy Bible, that illuminated lexicon of the\nsweet Beyond, and of the approaches thereto–that trusty talisman of\nall hopeful hearts–that competent counselor of the wisest and the\nbest–that inspirer of joy and satisfaction born of no other book–that\nprecious presager of immortal life beyond the river–that divine guide\nto faith and practice, can by no means fail in the ultimate working out\nof its sublime purposes.",
        "In the ranks of Odd-Fellowship there are many of the truest, noblest,\nsharpest and most holy men in the civilized world.  None of these have\nbeen able to make that “Godless and selfish” discovery.  This brilliant\nachievement is reserved for those favored mortals that never saw the\ninside of an Odd-Fellow’s lodge, and are entirely ignorant of its\ncharacter and practical workings.  The order has increased largely in\nwealth, power and influence.  Large cities and towns, which formerly\npaid little or no attention to us, now eagerly welcome us to their\nhospitalities.",
        "Judges and governors vie with each other in doing us honor, and well\nmay we be proud of the position the order has attained.  Just think of\nit a moment: when you clasp hands with an Odd-Fellow here in your own\nhome, you are really clasping hands with one million men who have\nobligated themselves to stay with you through every trial and\nmisfortune.  Wonder no longer, then, at the growth and stability of\nthis great fraternity, or that its votaries cling to it with such\nunshaken and unswerving fidelity.  Ah! it is no light matter, no small\nprivilege, to be admitted to membership in such an organization–so\nfreeing one’s self from the surgings of self-seeking and selfish\nconsiderations–free from the trammels of prevailing prejudice and\npassion–free from the false educational influences that warp the mind\nand drive charity from the heart.",
