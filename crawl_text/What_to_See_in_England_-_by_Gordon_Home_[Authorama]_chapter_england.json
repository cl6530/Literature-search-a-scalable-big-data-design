        "This book is intended to put in the smallest possible space the means by\nwhich one may reach the chief places of interest in England and Wales.\nIt will possibly make many holidays, week-ends, or isolated days more\nenjoyable by placing a defined objective before the rambler. Places\nwithin an hour or two of London are in the front of the book, so that as\none turns over the pages one is taken further and further afield. The\nbrief summary of the interests of each place, and the many\nillustrations, may help to memorise the impressions obtained.",
        "The first edition of a book of this nature must of necessity be\nincomplete, and the author is prepared to hear of long lists of places\nwhich should have been included, and also to hear criticisms on his\nchoice of those appearing. It is to some extent natural that special\nfamiliarity with certain places and certain writers or heroes of the\npast may distort one’s vision, and perhaps induce a choice of subjects\nwhich may not seem so comprehensive to some individuals as to others.\nFuture editions will, however, give ample scope for embracing all the\ngood suggestions which may be made.",

        "The little church at Petersham is interesting on account of the memorial\nit contains to the memory of Vancouver, the discoverer, in 1792, of the\nisland bearing his name, on the west coast of the North American\ncontinent. It is said that “the unceasing exertions which Vancouver\nhimself made to complete the gigantic task of surveying 9000 miles of\nunknown and intricate coasts–a labour chiefly performed in open\nboats–made an inroad on his constitution from which he never recovered,\nand, declining gradually, he died in May 1798.” The church is also the\nburying-place of the Duchess of Lauderdale, whose residence was Ham\nHouse. This fine old Jacobean mansion stands at no great distance from\nPetersham Church. It was built as a residence for Prince Henry, the\neldest son of James I., who, however, died early, the gossips of the\ntime hinting at poison. The house is still said to be haunted by the\nspirit of the old Duchess of Lauderdale, who lived in the time of\nCharles II.",

        "Harrow, from its high position, 200 feet above the sea, was selected by\nthe Romans as an important military station. By the Saxons it was called\nHereways, and was purchased in 822 by Wilfred, Archbishop of Canterbury.\nThe ancient manor-house, of which no traces now remain, was formerly the\nresidence of the Archbishops of Canterbury, and it was here that Thomas\nà Becket resided during his banishment from Court. Cardinal Wolsey, who\nwas once Rector of Harrow, resided at Pinner, and is said to have\nentertained Henry VIII. during his visit to Harrow. The manor was\nexchanged by Archbishop Cranmer with the king for other lands, and was\nsubsequently given to Sir Edmund Dudley, afterwards Lord North.",
        "At the bottom of the hill, and spreading rapidly in all directions, are\nquantities of modern houses and villas, but the point of greatest\ninterest in Harrow is the celebrated school, wonderfully situated on the\nvery summit of the hill, with views extending over thirteen counties.\nFounded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by John Lyon, a yeoman of the\nparish, the school has now grown enormously, the oldest portion being\nthat near the church, which was erected three years after the founder’s\ndeath. In the wainscotting of the famous schoolroom are the carvings cut\nby many generations of Harrovians, among them being the names of Peel,\nByron, Sheridan, the Marquess of Hastings, Lord Normanby, and many\nothers.",
        "The church stands on the extreme summit of the hill, and from the\nchurchyard the view is simply magnificent. In the building are some\ninteresting tombs and brasses, and a monument to John Lyon, the founder\nof the school.",
        "The grave shown on the opposite page is known as “Byron’s tomb,” on\naccount of his fondness for the particular spot it occupied in the\nchurchyard, from whence the fascinating view just mentioned can be seen,\nfrom the shade of the trees growing on either side.",

        "Visitors are able to pass through the park on a public footpath.\nAbout 3 miles’ walk from Hayes Station by a pleasant road over Hayes\nCommon is Holwood House, a stately, classic building, for many years the\nhome of William Pitt, the famous statesman and son of the Earl of\nChatham. He owned the estate between 1785 and 1802, and it was during\nthis period that the British camp in the park suffered so severely. The\nearth-works were occupied by some early British tribe before Caesar\ncrossed the Channel, and the place probably owed its strength to its\nwell-chosen position. Pitt, however, caused these fascinating remains to\nbe levelled to a considerable extent, in order to carry out some of his\nideas of landscape gardening. A magnificent tree growing near the house\nis known as “Pitt’s Oak,” from the tradition that Pitt was specially\nfond of spending long periods of quiet reading beneath its overshadowing\nboughs. Another tree of more interest still stands quite near the public\nfootpath through the park. This is known as “Wilberforce’s Oak,” and is\neasily distinguished from the surrounding trees by the stone seat\nconstructed in its shade. The momentous decision which makes this tree\nso interesting is given in Wilberforce’s diary for the year 1788. He\nwrites, “At length, I well remember after a conversation with Mr. Pitt\nin the open air at the root of an old tree at Holwood, just above the\nsteep descent into the vale of Keston, I resolved to give notice on a\nfit occasion in the House of Commons of my intention to bring forward\nthe abolition of the slave-trade.”",
        "With the exception of Knole Park, Holwood boasts some of the finest\nbeeches in the country. The present house took the place of the one\noccupied by Pitt in 1825; the architect was Decimus Burton.",

        "In 1844 Charles Dickens wrote to Forster: “Chigwell, my dear fellow, is\nthe greatest place in the world. Name your day for going. Such a\ndelicious old inn facing the church–such a lovely ride–such forest\nscenery–such an out-of-the-way rural place–such a sexton! I say again,\nName your day.” This is surely sufficient recommendation for any place;\nand when one knows that the “delicious old inn” is still standing, and\nthat the village is as rural and as pretty as when Dickens wrote over\nsixty years ago, one cannot fail to have a keen desire to see the place.\n\"The King’s Head” illustrated here is the inn Dickens had in his mind\nwhen describing the “Maypole” in Barnaby Rudge, and the whole of the\nplot of that work is so wrapped up in Chigwell and its immediate\nsurroundings that one should not visit the village until one has read\nthe story. One may see the panelled “great room” upstairs where Mr.\nChester met Mr. Geoffrey Haredale. This room has a fine mantelpiece,\ngreat carved beams, and beautiful leaded windows. On the ground floor is\nthe cosy bar where the village cronies gathered with Mr. Willett, and\none may also see the low room with the small-paned windows against which\nJohn Willett flattened his nose looking out on the road on the dark\nnight when the story opens.",
        "Chigwell School, built in 1629, and founded by Archbishop Harsnett,\nstill remains, although there have been several modern additions. Here\nWilliam Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, was educated. (See Index for\nJordans and Penn’s Chapel at Thakeham.)",
        "Chigwell Church, facing “The King’s Head,” has a dark avenue of yews\nleading from the road to the porch. A brass to the memory of Archbishop\nHarsnett may be seen on the floor of the chancel. The epitaph in Latin\nwas ordered to be so written in the will of the archbishop. Translated,\nthe first portion may be read: “Here lieth Samuel Harsnett, formerly\nvicar of this church. First the unworthy Bishop of Chichester, then the\nmore unworthy Bishop of Norwich, at last the very unworthy Archbishop of\nYork.”",

        "Waltham Abbey is a market town in Essex on the banks of the Lea, which\nhere divides into several branches which are used as motive power for\nsome gunpowder and flour mills. Harold II. founded the stately Abbey\nChurch in May 1060. William the Conqueror disputed Harold’s claim to the\nthrone and landed in England at Pevensey in 1066. At Waltham Abbey,\ntroubled and anxious, Harold prayed for victory in England’s name before\nthe fatal battle of Hastings, where he was slain. William at first\nrefused to give up Harold’s body to his mother, Gytha, but he afterwards\nallowed two monks from Waltham to search for the body of the king. They\nwere unable to find it amongst the nameless dead, but his favourite,\nEdith the swan-necked, whose eye of affection was not to be deceived,\ndiscovered it. His weeping mother buried the disfigured corpse probably\nabout 120 feet from the east end of the old church.",
        "At Waltham is one of the many crosses erected by Edward I. in memory of\nhis first wife, Eleanor of Castile, wherever her body rested on its way\nto Westminster from Lincoln. At Northampton is another of these famous\ncrosses. When the king asked the Abbot of Cluny to intercede for her\nsoul, he said, “We loved her tenderly in her lifetime; we do not cease\nto love her in death.”",
        "A little way to the left of Waltham Cross, now a gateway to the park of\nTheobalds, stands Temple Bar, stone for stone intact as it was in the\ndays when traitors’ heads were raised above it in Fleet Street, although\nthe original wooden gates have gone. A portion of the richly-carved top\nof the gate is still in existence in London. Waltham Abbey is probably\nclose to that part of the river Lea where King Alfred defeated the\nDanes. They had penetrated far up the river when King Alfred diverted\nthe waters of the river from underneath their black vessels and left\nthem high and dry in a wilderness of marsh and forest. The gentle\nCharles Lamb was very fond of the country all round Waltham Abbey,\nespecially Broxbourne and Amwell.",

        "The home of the great scientist is still standing in the little village\nof Downe in Kent. The road to the hamlet is through Farnborough, and the\nwalk takes an hour. Downe is a pleasant place, possessing a large\nvillage pond and a small church with a shingled spire. Darwin’s home,\nknown as Downe House, was built in the eighteenth century. Its front is\nof white stucco, relieved by ivy and other creepers. The wing on the\nwest side of the house was added by Darwin shortly after he came to live\nthere. This new portion of the house was used partly to accommodate his\nlibrary. On the north side is the room used by Darwin as a study, in\nwhich he wrote some of his most important works. The garden of the house\nis sheltered and reposeful, and from the old wall-garden to the south\nthere is a beautiful view over the delightful stretch of country in the\ndirection of Westerham.",
        "The life led by Darwin when at Downe was exceedingly quiet and regular,\nfor he always went to bed at an early hour, and rising at six was\nenabled to get in a walk and breakfast before commencing work at eight\no’clock. At some other time of the day he would manage to get an\nopportunity for another walk, and part of the evening would be given up\nto his family and friends who were privileged to enjoy conversation with\nthe great author of The Origin of Species. Professor Haeckel,\ndescribing a visit to Darwin’s home, says, “There stepped out to meet me\nfrom the shady porch ... the great naturalist himself, a tall and\nvenerable figure, with the broad shoulders of an Atlas supporting a\nworld of thought, his Jupiter-like forehead, highly and broadly arched\n... and deeply furrowed with the plough of mental labour; his kindly,\nmild eyes looking forth under the shadow of prominent brows.”",

        "One must choose any other than a race-day if one wishes to see the\ncharming old town of Epsom at its best. But if, on the other hand, one\nwishes, to see something of the scene on the race-course depicted in Mr.\nFrith’s famous picture, one gets no suggestion of the great spectacle\nexcept on race-days. On these occasions, at the Spring meeting and\nduring Derby week, one has merely to follow the great streams of\nhumanity which converge on the downs from the roads from London and from\nthe railway stations. On ordinary days the wide rolling downs are\ngenerally left alone to the health-giving breezes which blow over them.\nIn the town itself there is much to be seen of the seventeenth-century\narchitecture associated with the days of Epsom’s fame as a\nwatering-place. The wide portion of the High Street at once attracts\none’s notice, for with one or two exceptions its whole length is full of\nthe quaintest of buildings with cream walls and mossy tiled roofs. The\nclock-tower was built in 1848, when it replaced a very simple old\nwatch-house with a curious little tower rising from it. The “Spread\nEagle” is one of the oldest of the Epsom inns; its irregular front and\nits position looking up the High Street make it more conspicuous than\nthe “King’s Head,” an equally old and very interesting hostelry facing\nthe clock-tower. Pepys stayed there in 1667, for in his diary of July 14\nof that year he writes, “To Epsom, by eight o’clock, to the well; where\nmuch company. And to the towne to the King’s Head; and hear that my Lord\nBuckhurst and Nelly (Gwynne) are lodged at the next house, and Sir\nCharles Sedley with them: and keep a merry house.” This house, next to\nthe “King’s Head,” is still standing. A little further along the street\nis the large red-brick building known to-day as Waterloo House. It was\nbuilt about the year 1680, and was then known as the New Inn. The old\nbanqueting-hall it contains is divided up now, for the building is\nconverted into shops.",

        "Those who wish to ramble through Epping Forest off the beaten paths\nshould carry a compass and a map, so that they do not merely keep in one\nsection of the forest, and thus miss some of the tracts which are quite\ndistinct in character to others. The best days during the summer for\nhaving the glades to one’s self are Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, but\nduring the winter the whole place is left to the keepers and the\nfeathered inhabitants of the forest. During spring and autumn one also\nfinds that the grassy walks are left almost entirely alone, and at these\nperiods the forest is at its very best. Those who have only visited it\nin the height of summer, when the foliage is perhaps drooping a little,\nwhen the birds are not singing, and when there are traces of more than\none picnic party, have no idea of the true beauty of the forest. A herd\nof deer are allowed to breed in the wilder and less frequented portions\nif the forest, and these add much to the charm of some of the umbrageous\nby-paths when one suddenly disturbs a quietly grazing group. Queen\nElizabeth’s hunting lodge, which adjoins the Forest Hotel at Chingford,\nis a restored three-storied and much gabled building, constructed of\nplastered brickwork and framed with oak. It seems that the building\noriginally had no roof, but merely an open platform, from which one\ncould obtain a good comprehensive view of any sport going on in the\nvicinity. The lodge has now been made the home of a museum of objects of\nantiquity discovered in the forest. The special points of Epping Forest\nwhich should be included in a long day’s ramble are Connaught Water, a\nlake near Chingford; High Beach, an elevated portion of the forest\npossessing some splendid beeches; the earthwork known as Loughton Camp,\nwhich probably belongs to pre-Roman times, and Ambresbury Banks, towards\nEpping. This camp is said to have been the last fortress of the Britons\nunder Boadicea. From here they are believed to have marched against the\nRomans to receive the crushing defeat inflicted upon them.",

        "The approach from the station lies through a pair of finely designed\nwrought-iron gates to the north frontage of the palace, erected by\nWolsey himself. This front is all in the fine red-brick architecture of\nthe period, with quaint gables, small mullioned windows, and a\ncollection of moulded and twisted red-brick chimneys of wonderfully\nvaried designs. The entrance through the gatehouse, flanked by two\ntowers, is under a massive Tudor gateway, and leads into an inner\nquadrangle and thence into a second court, both of the same picturesque\ncharacter. In these inner courts are the suites of rooms given as\nresidences by royal favour, and on the left-hand side is Wolsey’s great\nbanqueting-hall, with a magnificent open timber roof.",
        "The southern and eastern portions, with the Fountain Court and the\nsplendid frontage to the gardens, were designed by Sir Christopher Wren,\nand form one of the best examples of his work.

        "Rye House stands close to the banks of the river Lea, and is now perhaps\nmore of a resort than some would wish it to be, for it has been altered\nfrom a manor-house into an hotel. It has not, however, quite lost its\npicturesqueness, as one will see from the illustration given here, and\nwithin one may see the fine old dining-hall and the famous “Great bed of\nWare,” large enough, it is said, to contain twelve people! The\nhistorical interest which attaches itself to Rye House, though well\nknown, may be briefly given here. It was in 1683 the scene of a plot, in\nCharles II.’s reign, to assassinate the king and his brother the Duke of\nYork, afterwards James II., on their way to London from Newmarket.\nCharles, though restored to the throne, was giving great dissatisfaction\nto many in the country. Though professedly a Protestant, it was well\nknown that his leanings were towards Roman Catholicism, and his brother\nthe Duke of York was an avowed Catholic. Then it was discovered that\nCharles had been receiving a pension from Louis XIV. of France, on\ncondition that this country did not go to war with the French, an\narrangement which was most humiliating to the English people. The nation\nwas thoroughly alarmed, and at the next meeting of Parliament the\nCommons brought in a bill to exclude the Duke of York from ever coming\nto the throne. Many of the leading Whigs, including Lord William\nRussell, Algernon Sidney, and the Earl of Essex, formed a confederacy.\nIt has never been proved that they ever meant the country to rise\nagainst the king, but unfortunately, just at the same time, some bolder\nand fiercer spirits of the Whig party determined to kill both Charles\nand James at the lonely Rye House belonging to Rumbolt. The plot failed\nfrom the fact that the house which the king occupied at Newmarket\naccidentally caught fire, and Charles was obliged to leave Newmarket a\nweek sooner than was expected. This conspiracy as well as the meetings\nof the Whig party were betrayed to the king’s ministers. Russell was\nbeheaded in 1683, and Sidney shared the same fate.",

The vicarage is also to\nbe seen, and though much altered at the back, the front portion,\ncontaining the actual room in which Wolfe was born, is the same as in\nthe past. It has a three-light window towards the front, and two small\nwindows in the gable at the side. Quebec House is near the vicarage. It\ndoes not bear its name upon it, but it will be pointed out on inquiry.\nThe front is a most disappointing stucco affair, but this merely hides\nthe beautiful Elizabethan gables which originally adorned the house from\nevery point of view. Two private tenants now occupy the house, but the\ninterior is on the whole very little altered since little James Wolfe\nplayed hide-and-seek in the old passages and rooms. Squerryes Court, the\nseat of Lieut.-Colonel C.A.M. Warde, J.P., is the local storehouse of\nWolfe relics. Numbers of letters, portraits, and other interesting\nobjects are all carefully preserved there. Young Wolfe was constantly at\nSquerryes, and the spot in the park where he received his first\ncommission is marked by a stone cenotaph.",

        "Guildford High Street is without doubt one of the most picturesque in\nEngland. When one stands beneath the shadow of the quaint\nseventeenth-century town hall, with its great clock projecting half-way\nacross the street towards the Corn Exchange, with its classic stone\nportico, a most charming picture is spread before one. The steep street\ndropping down to the river Wey, with the great green slopes of the Hog’s\nBack rising immediately beyond, framed in with quaint gabled fronts and\nprojecting windows. The castle, though very much in ruins, still\npossesses its huge square keep standing upon an artificial mound. Both\nthe keep and the other portions of the fortress were probably built in\nthe reign of Henry II. Those who are endeavouring to read the history of\nthe castle should bear in mind that in 1623 it was converted into a\nprivate dwelling-house, and this accounts for the red brick mullions in\nthe upper windows of the keep. From the highest portion of the walls\nthere is an exceedingly pretty view up the winding course of the Wey.\nAbbot’s Hospital, at the top of the High Street, was built in 1619. It\nis an exceedingly picturesque old structure of red brick, with\nconspicuously fine chimney-stacks. The buildings enclose a beautiful\ncourtyard full of the richest architectural detail. The dining-hall is\noak-panelled almost to the ceiling, and contains oak tables, benches,\nand stools.

A mile and a half\nfrom this ancient city with its cathedral and castle is Gad’s Hill\nPlace, where the great author resided from 1856 till the day of his\ndeath in 1870. When Dickens was a small boy the house had always a\ncurious interest for him, for he thought it the most beautiful house he\nhad ever seen. His father, then living in Rochester, used to bring him\nto look at it, and used to tell the little fellow that if he grew up to\nbe a clever man he might own that or another such house. Gad’s Hill\nPlace is a comfortable old-fashioned house, built, it is said, about\n1775. Facing it is a shrubbery containing huge cedars. This was\nconnected with the grounds opposite by an underground passage still\nexisting, and here Dickens erected a châlet given to him by his friend\nMr. Fechter, in which he worked till the time of his sudden death. Gad’s\nHill had a peculiar fascination for Dickens, for it was on the highway\nthere that he obtained his wonderful insight into the character and\nmanners of the various tramps and showmen he portrays in his books.",

        "The pleasant little village of Penshurst, situated 6 miles north-west\nfrom Tunbridge Wells, is renowned for the beautiful fourteenth-century\nmansion known as Penshurst Place. From Norman times a house has occupied\nthe site, but the present building did not come into existence until\n1349, when Sir John de Poultenay, who was four times Lord Mayor of\nLondon, built the present historic seat. Having come into the possession\nof the Crown, the estate was given by Edward VI. to Sir William Sidney,\nwho had fought at Flodden Field. The unfortunate young King Edward died\nin the arms of Sir William’s son Henry, whose grief was so excessive\nthat he retired to Penshurst and lived there in seclusion. Sir Henry\nSidney had three children, one of whom being Sir Philip Sidney, the type\nof a most gallant knight and perfect gentleman. It was at Penshurst that\nEdmund Spenser, Sir Philip’s friend, wrote his first work, the\nShepherd’s Calendar, and though Sidney did not actually write his\nfamous poem Arcadia in his beautiful Kentish home, its scenery must\nhave suggested many of the descriptions. Algernon Sidney, who was\nillegally put to death through Judge Jeffreys, was the nephew of Sir\nPhilip, and he is supposed to be buried in Penshurst Church, though no\nmonument remains. The present owner of Penshurst is Lord De Lisle and\nDudley (Sir Philip Charles Sidney (died 1851) was given the peerage in\n1835), who allows visitors to view the historic mansion on Tuesdays,\nThursdays, and Fridays, from 3 P.M. to 6 P.M. (admission 1s.). The great\nfeature of the house is the baronial hall, built in 1341, which has a\nhearth in the centre of the room. The Queen’s drawing-room, said to have\nbeen furnished by Queen Elizabeth, contains some interesting Tudor\nfurniture, and the satin tapestry which adorns the walls is also\nbelieved to be the work of the virgin queen and her maidens. There are\nmany valuable and interesting portraits of the famous members of the\nSidney family. In the beautiful grounds of Penshurst is an oak tree,\nplanted, says tradition, at the time of Sir Philip Sidney’s birth.",

Its British name was equivalent to “the grey\nrock in the woods,” a traditional name, apparently confirmed by the\ndiscovery of a submarine forest extending for some miles round the base\nof the mount. The beauty of the spot caused it to be selected by the\nancient Britons as a favourite resort for worship, and shortly after the\nintroduction of Christianity it became a place of pilgrimage, and was\nvisited in the fifth century by St. Kelna, a British princess, who\nfounded a hermitage there.

        "Rochester, a most picturesque old town on the river Medway, has been a\nplace of importance from the earliest times. The cathedral, which is not\nvery impressive externally, and is much surrounded by houses, is best\nseen from the castle. It was the first church built after Augustine\nsettled in Canterbury, but of this building no trace now remains except\nsome foundations. The Norman Bishop Gundulf in 1080 built a large\nportion of the Norman work of the present cathedral. In 1201 it was\nlargely rebuilt by money obtained from thank-offerings for miracles\nwrought by St. William, a baker of Perth, who was murdered near\nRochester on his way to Canterbury, and buried in the cathedral. The\nNorman castle, standing on the banks of the river, was built by Bishop\nGundulf, and though it is now in ruins, the interior having been\ndestroyed for its timber, the walls remain firm. The castle was besieged\nby William Rufus and Simon de Montfort, and on both occasions suffered\nconsiderable damage. One of the many interesting buildings in the High\nStreet is the three-gabled house of Watts’s Charity, which has become\nfamous from Dickens’s Christmas story of The Seven Poor Travellers.\nAccording to the inscription above the doorway, Richard Watts in 1579\nfounded this “Charity for Six Poor Travellers, who not being Rogues or\nProctors, may receive gratis for one night, Lodging, Entertainment, and\nFourpence each.” Restoration House, an old red-brick mansion on the\nMaidstone Road, is so named from the visit of Charles II. on his way to\nLondon in 1660. To all admirers of Charles Dickens, Rochester is full of\nmemories (see Index, Gad’s Hill). Not only did Dickens make Rochester\nthe scene of his last unfinished work, Edwin Drood, but he made many\nallusions to it elsewhere. Mr. Jingle, for instance, in the Pickwick\nPapers says, “Ah! fine place, glorious pile–frowning walls–tottering\narches–dark nooks–crumbling staircases–old cathedral too–earthy\nsmell–pilgrims’ feet worn away the old steps.”",

One game which he and two of his\nbrothers were never tired of playing was that of rolling each other like\nbarrels down the very steep sandy hill which one may see rising sharply\nfrom the back of the “Jolly Farmer.” Cobbett left Farnham for London\nwhen he was twenty-one, but often revisited his native town in later\nyears. When he died, in 1835, he was buried in Farnham churchyard. The\ngrave faces the porch on the north side of the church. The Rev.

Following the road Londonwards, one\narrives in a few hundred yards at the very highest point of the road\nover Hindhead, after which it drops gently, skirting the magnificent\nhollow known as the “Devil’s Punchbowl.” On the left-hand side, in the\nloneliest part of the road, is the gruesome tombstone which marks the\nspot where an unknown sailor was murdered and robbed while tramping from\nPortsmouth to London.

In 1871, while Middlemarchwas appearing in parts, George Eliot, who as Mr. Lewes said, “never\nseemed at home except under a broad sweep of sky,” spent part of the\nspring and summer at Brookbank,–an old-fashioned gabled cottage in the\nvillage (close to the church) with delightful lattice-paned\nwindows,–belonging to a Mrs. Gilchrist. At this time George Eliot was\nin a delicate state of health and scarcely equal to finishing her new\nstory. One cannot call it a novel, for it had no plot. It was simply a\nremarkable picture of provincial life in the first half of the\nnineteenth century. George Eliot greatly enjoyed her quiet life at\nShottermill, although many of her friends thought it incomprehensible\nthat she could endure such a secluded life. One can scarcely read her\ngraphic description of the sweet beauty of a Warwickshire lane, with its\nhedgerows all radiant in summer beauty, without feeling how much this\nremarkable woman loved it all, and in some degree one may understand how\nrestful were the village surroundings. They led a most uneventful life,\nbut occasionally would pay a visit to Tennyson, whose house at Aldworth\nwas only 3 miles off. George Eliot rarely went out in the daytime, but\nsometimes she would go to see some cottagers and have a chat with them.\nA farmer’s wife was greatly astonished at her knowledge of\nbutter-making, and of the growth of fruit and vegetables, little\nimagining that in her early days, after her mother’s death, the great\nauthoress had managed the dairy in her own home at Griff House.",

Penn, who bought the house in 1682, probably chose its site\non account of its remoteness, for those were the days when their\nmeetings were at any moment liable to interruption–when the members of\nthe congregation met together knowing well that discovery meant\nimprisonment.

The stream at the\nnorth-western end often fails, but the other, known as the “Well-Head,\"\nis a fine spring, seldom influenced by drought. Wolmer Forest, near by,\nis famed for its timber. In the centre of the village, on a piece of\nground commonly known as “The Plestor,” there stood, until the fearful\nstorm of 1703, a colossal oak tree, with a short body and enormous\nhorizontally spreading arms. The stone steps, with seats above them,\nsurrounding the tree, formed a favourite resort for both old and young\nduring summer evenings.

William\nthe Conqueror gave Lewes to Earl William de Warenne, who had married\nGundrada, said to be the daughter of Queen Matilda and the Conqueror. De\nWarenne built the castle, or considerably enlarged the old Saxon\nfortress, which is now in ruins. The castle possessed a curious feature,\nof which no other examples now remain, in having two keeps, each built\nupon a mound. Only one of these keeps (admission 6d.) still exists, its\ntowers covered with ivy. From its summit a splendid view of the\nsurrounding country can be obtained towards the chalk bluffs of the\nSouth Downs and the valley of the Ouse. The great gateway of the castle\nstill stands, and in Southover, the suburb of Lewes, are the remains of\nthe once large and wealthy Priory of St. Pancras. This was the first\nCluniac establishment in England. It was founded by De Warenne and\nGundrada, and continued to be of great importance up to the dissolution.\nUntil about sixty years ago the old pigeon-house of the priory,\ncontaining 3228 pigeon-holes, was still standing. When excavations were\ngoing on during the construction of the railway, which passes through\nthe priory grounds, the workmen came upon two leaden coffins, which were\ndiscovered to be those of William de Warenne and his wife. These were\nremoved to Southover Church, and Gundrada’s grave has now its original\ntombstone of black marble, which was found in Isfield Church. On the\nsite of the race-course was fought in 1264 the battle of Lewes, between\nHenry III. and the insurgent barons, led by Simon de Montfort, Earl of\nLeicester.

It was one\nof the earliest buildings since Roman times to be built of brick. The\nterra-cotta mouldings are a peculiar feature. It is thought that Lord\nMarney brought over Italian workmen to make the terra-cotta, for there\nis a classic touch about the ornaments. The gateway has two towers, one\nivy-clad. The whole structure is strikingly original in style. It was\ncommenced in 1500, but Lord Marney died before the work was done. John,\nhis son, died the next year, and with him the line of Marneys became\nextinct.",
        "In the church are three monuments of the Marneys. The tomb of Henry,\nLord Marney, is in the arch leading to the Marney Chapel, which was\nfounded by him. The figure is of dark marble, clad in armour, and\nwearing the robes of a Knight of the Garter. An ancestor of Lord Marney,\nwho died in 1414, lies near. The effigy is clothed in mail. The figure\nof John, the last of the Marneys, is of black marble. There are some\ncurious frescoes in the church, and an oak screen. The interior of the\nbuilding is probably older than the exterior, which is of about the same\ndate as the towers.",

Cowper lost his mother at a very\nearly age, and the sad event made a deep impression on his mind. In\nafter years he wrote a poem addressed to his mother’s portrait which it\nis said has drawn more tears than any other poem in the English\nlanguage. Cowper was sent to school at six years of age, but was very\nunhappy there, and it laid the foundation of that settled gloom which\noppressed him all through life. When Cowper had finished his studies at\nthe Westminster School he commenced the study of law, and was afterwards\ncalled to the bar; but he never practised, for he hated law. Cowper was\noffered several appointments, but failed in examinations for them from\nextreme nervousness. By the kindness of friends an income was secured\nfor him and he went to reside at Huntingdon. Here he formed an\nacquaintance with Mrs. Unwin, the “Mary” of his poems, which ripened\ninto deepest friendship.

        "At the period of the Norman Conquest the city was of considerable size,\nand the castle, of which very little now remains, is reputed to be the\nwork of William the Conqueror. The cathedral was burnt down at least\ntwice before the present building was erected, but under the influence\nof the Norman archbishops, Lanfranc and Anselm, the erection of the new\n\"Church of Christ” proceeded apace. But it was not until the end of the\ntwelfth century that the murder of Becket set the whole of Europe\nringing with excitement, and Canterbury rose at once into the front rank\nas an ecclesiastical city and pilgrims’ shrine.",
        "At the time when Chaucer wrote his Canterbury Tales the city was\nsurrounded by a strong wall with twenty-one towers and six gates. Of the\nwall there are some remains in Broad Street; of the gates “West Gate,\"\nthrough which the pilgrims entered from London, is the only survivor.",
        "Canterbury teems with interesting relics of the past, and weeks may be\nspent in its old-world streets, where one is continually coming across\nunexpected little bits of half-timber work, weather-beaten gables, and\ngrotesque oak carving. The cathedral, whose “Bell Harry” or central\ntower seems to dominate the whole city, should be approached through\nMercery Lane, at the corner of which are some slight remains of\nChaucer’s hostelry, “The Chequers of Hope.” At the bottom of the lane\nthe cathedral close is entered by the famous Christ Church Gateway,\nerected by Prior Goldstone in 1517. Once inside the close gate the\nvisitor gets some idea of the amazing beauty of the structure, which is\ncertainly unsurpassed by any other cathedral in the kingdom. The\nbuilding exhibits almost every style of architecture, from the Norman\nwork of William of Lens to the late Perpendicular of Prior Goldstone,\nand yet the work of composition and design has been so exquisitely\ncarried out that there is no hint of any want of harmony in the\nmagnificent whole. The interior is no less remarkable, the arches and\nvaulting of the nave being some of the most beautiful in existence.\nBecket’s shrine was despoiled at the Reformation, but the number of\npilgrims who visited it may be imagined from the fact that the broad\nstone steps are worn hollow, and this only by the knees of his\nworshippers. The Angel doorway in the cloisters, by which the archbishop\nentered the sacred building pursued by his murderers, gives access on to\nthe north-west or martyrdom transept. Here is shown the spot where the\nprimate made his last stand and fell under the blows of the Norman\nknights. Another object of special interest is the tomb of Edward, the\nBlack Prince, who died in the city in 1376.

In the ninth century a Benedictine abbey was\nfounded at Regulbium by a priest named Bapa. A few years after, King\nEdred granted the abbey to the Monastery of Christchurch at Canterbury,\nbut the society was either removed or dissolved before the Norman\nConquest. This practically ends the history of Regulbium, for owing to\nthe steady encroachments of the sea, and to the fact that the estuary\ncontinued to fill up, the once populous Roman city was gradually\ndeserted.

In those\ndays two rivers met in the High Street of the little town that grew\nround St. Guthlac’s Monastery.

Many\nexpeditions for Normandy embarked here during the reigns of the\nPlantagenets, and the men who fought and won at Crecy and Agincourt must\nhave passed, on the way to their ships, under the old West Gate, which\nstill remains much as it was in those stirring times.",

        "Sir Norman Lockyer’s recent observations at the summer solstice have\nplaced the date of erection at about 1680 B.C., and the discovery of\nflint implements beneath some Roman remains also points to neolithic\ntimes. The upright stones and those resting upon them were originally\nall mortised and tenoned together, and from the fact that no similar\nstone is found nearer than Marlborough Downs the primitive men must have\nhauled the stones considerable distances by means of long leather ropes.\nThe small blue stones were possibly brought from Normandy.",

        "It is difficult to realise that Sandwich, now 1-1/2 miles from the\ncoast, was yet once situated on the sea, and was the second in\nimportance of the Cinque Ports. In Roman and early Saxon times a wide\narm of the Thames, called the Wantsume, flowed from Reculver (then known\nas Regulbium), where it was a mile wide, southwards to what is now the\nmouth of the Stour. Between Ebbsfleet and Worth it was over 4 miles\nwide. The Roman fortress of Ritupiae (Richborough) guarded it on the\nsouth, and the river Stour flowed into it at Stourmouth. This stream\ncaused so much alluvial deposit that the sea receded from Richborough in\nearly Saxon times, and part of the population removed to Sandwich. The\nrepeated attacks by the Danes and the French did not check the growth of\nthe town, which attained its maximum prosperity in Edward IV.’s reign,\nwhen it was walled. But the sea left its shores, and the town declined\nto again rise in importance, when the 400 Flemish emigrants settled\nthere in Elizabeth’s reign and introduced silk-weaving, flannel\nmanufactures, and market-gardening.",

It is chiefly noted for the\nruins of the famous castle, so celebrated from its association with Sir\nWalter Scott’s romance. The castle was built in the reign of Henry I.,\nthe site having been granted to Geoffrey de Clinton, Lord Chief Justice\nof England. The fortress at one time belonged to Simon de Montfort, who\nimprisoned Henry III. and his son Edward during the War of the Barons.\nEdward II. also was forced to sign his abdication there. Queen Elizabeth\ngave the castle as a present to her favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of\nLeicester, who spent large sums in making great alterations and\nadditions, and entertained the Queen on four different occasions. The\nmemorable visit that has been described by Scott took place in 1575,\nwhen Dudley not only lodged Queen Elizabeth, her court, and 400 servants\nfor seventeen days, but provided a series of pageants and festivities to\nplease his royal mistress. During the Civil War the castle was taken by\nCromwell and given by him to Colonel Hawkesworth and some other officers\nbelonging to his army. They destroyed the place very much, draining the\nlake, besides pulling down walls and towers. The estate now belongs to\nthe Earl of Clarendon, to whose ancestor, Lawrence Hyde, Earl of\nRochester, it was given by Charles II. The only building which has still\npreserved its roof is the gatehouse, built by Robert Dudley. It is now\nused as a dwelling-house, and contains some beautiful panelling and also\na wonderful chimney-piece. The rest of the castle is very ruined, but\nthe remains are of great interest, being sufficient to convey an\nimpression of the castle as it originally stood. Close to the parish\nchurch are the ruins of the priory, which was founded at the same time\nas the castle, by Geoffrey de Clinton. At the Dissolution it was\ncompletely destroyed, and only the gatehouse remains.",

        "Belvoir Castle, the Leicestershire seat of the Duke of Rutland, stands\non a lofty eminence, commanding a magnificent view over the rich vale of\nBelvoir. It was originally founded by Robert de Todeni, a Norman noble,\nand a standard-bearer to William the Conqueror. In the reign of Henry\nIII. the property passed to Robert de Roos, and in the time of Henry\nVIII. to the family of Manners, who have held it ever since. The\nbuilding suffered much damage during the Wars of the Roses and the\nParliamentary Civil War. James I. was entertained there in 1603, on his\nway from Scotland to London, by Roger, the fifth Earl. In 1814, George\nIV., then Prince Regent, visited the castle, in commemoration of which\none of the towers was named Regent Tower. In 1816, alterations were\nbeing carried out in the interior, under the direction of James Wyatt,\nthe architect, when a fire broke out and almost entirely destroyed the\ncastle. The picture gallery and the grand staircase perished utterly,\nand the damage was reckoned at £120,000. The final restoration was\ncompleted by Matthew Wyatt, who succeeded in building one of the finest\npalaces in the length and breadth of England. One of the features of the\nmansion is a magnificent picture gallery in which hang priceless works\nby Nicolas Poussin, Claude, Murillo, Reynolds, Gainsborough, and other\nold masters. The name “Belvoir” is derived from the magnificent\nprospects lying around it in all directions, the view extending over the\nlevel country for 30 miles; more than 170 towns and villages are visible\nwithin its horizon.

The town was destroyed by the Danes, but it was\nrebuilt by King Alfred’s Ethelfleda, who also built a fortress on an\nartificial mound, overlooking the river. By the orders of William I. the\ncastle was enlarged, and afterwards given by the Conqueror to Henry de\nNewburgh, whom he made the first Earl of Warwick of the Norman line. The\ncastle was of such strength that when, in the reign of Henry III., it\nbecame the property of Margery, sister of Thomas de Newburgh, she was\ninformed that she would not be allowed to marry any one in whom the king\nhad not great confidence. The castle afterwards passed into the hands of\nthe Beauchamps, in whose family it remained until 1445, when the\nheiress, Anne, married Richard Neville, the “King-maker,” who took the\ntitle of Earl of Warwick. The title without the estates was given by\nJames I. to Robert, Lord Rich. The castle was given to Sir Fulke\nGreville, afterwards Lord Brooke. In 1759, when Edward Rich died without\nissue, Francis Greville was made Earl of Warwick, with whose descendants\nthe estates have since remained. The entrance to the castle is along a\nwinding road cut for more than 100 yards out of the solid rock. The\ncastle as it now stands is a splendid specimen of the fourteenth-century\nstronghold built in the transition period, when the mere fortress was\nbeing superseded by a building of more grace and comfort. St. Mary’s\nChurch in Warwick was rebuilt in the reign of Queen Anne, the former\nchurch, built by Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, having been\ndestroyed by fire in 1694.

        "Wells is essentially an ecclesiastical town. It has no history of its\nown, no great family has ever lived there, and it has no\nmanufactures,–it has simply grown up round the cathedral. For these\nreasons the quiet little Somersetshire town has preserved much of its\nantiquity and fascination. The presence of the natural wells, which\nstill are to be found in the gardens of the Bishop’s Palace, probably\ninduced King Ina in 704 to found a college of secular canons. Here a\nmonastery grew, and subsequently became a bishop’s see. John de Villula\ntransferred his seat to Bath in (_circa_) 1092, and in 1139 the title\nwas altered to Bishop of Bath and Wells. Wells is one of the smallest of\nthe English cathedrals, and is in many ways the most beautiful. The\nclear space in front emphasises the glorious way in which the three\nmassive towers harmonise with the ruins of the Bishop’s Palace, the\nremains of the Vicar’s Close, and the chapter-house. The present\nbuilding was commenced in 1121, but Bishop Joceline of Wells (1206-1242)\nrebuilt it from the middle of the choir to the west end. The Early\nEnglish work shows considerable differences to that in Salisbury and Ely\nCathedrals, being carried out by a local school of masons, who show\nconsiderable originality in design. The glory of Wells is centred in its\nwest front. The deep buttresses on the towers cast shadows which only\nserve to show up the marvellous sculptured figures of saints and kings,\nwhich may represent a Te Deum in stone. The inside of the cathedral is\nremarkable for the inverted arches which were put in the chancel to\nsupport the towers. Bishop Beckington built the three arches to the\nclose.",

Horatio Nelson, the fourth son of Edmund and\nCatherine Nelson, was born on September 29, 1758, at the Parsonage\nHouse, which has unfortunately been pulled down. There are, however,\nmany interesting relics of Nelson in the village church, and it is\ninteresting to see the surroundings among which Nelson’s childhood was\npassed. In the parish register may be seen the signature of Nelson as a\nwitness to a marriage in the year 1769, when he was eleven years old.\nThere is a lectern constructed from the wood of the old Victory, which\nwas presented by the Lords of the Admiralty in 1881. The old Purbeck\nmarble font in which Horatio was baptized is still to be seen in the\nchurch. How much Nelson loved his native village can be understood from\nhis remark as the Victory was going into action, “This is the happiest\nday of my life; what a happy day, too, for Burnham Thorpe, for it is the\nday of their fair.”",
        "Nelson’s father was not by any means well off, and the question of\nproviding for his sons was a very serious one. Horatio, however, solved\nthe question as to his own career. At the Grammar School at Norwich,\nNelson said to his brother, “Do, William, write to my father and tell\nhim that I should like to go to sea with Uncle Maurice.” Captain Maurice\nSuckling is said to have heard of Horatio’s decision with some surprise,\nfor he said, “What has poor Horatio done, who is so weak, that he, above\nall the rest, should be sent to rough it out at sea? But let him come,\nand the first time we go into action a cannon-ball may knock off his\nhead and provide for him at once.”",

The narrow opening to the cove is between\ntwo bluffs of Portland stone, forming a portion of what was the barrier\nto the sea in former times. Once, however, did the waves eat through the\nPortland stone in this place, it was easy work to gradually batter down\nand wash out, through the narrow opening, a circular bay from the soft\nstrata of Hastings sands lying in the protection of the Portland stone.\nOn the west side of the cove one may notice rocks with such peculiarly\ncontorted strata as those shown in the foreground of the illustration\nopposite.",

Shortly after the days of Alfred the Great the hill\nwas strongly fortified by King Edgar, who made it his residence and\nprobably built the central keep, whose ruins still crown the summit of\nthe hill.

The roof is of stone and is surmounted by a louvre, through\nwhich the smoke escaped during the great culinary preparations in the\ndays of the abbey’s prosperity. The gargoyles around the building,\nrepresenting the heads of sheep and oxen, are suggestive of the purpose\nof the building. Henry VIII., who coveted the treasures of the abbey, in\n1539 summoned Abbot Whiting to surrender, and on his refusal ordered him\nto be drawn and quartered.

Walsingham was an important place for many centuries, for it\ncontained the famous shrine of the Virgin, or, as it was called, “Our\nLady of Walsingham.” This far-famed chapel of the Virgin was founded by\nRicoldie, the mother of Geoffrey de Faverches. When Geoffrey set out on\na pilgrimage to Jerusalem, he granted to God and St. Mary, and to Edwy,\nhis clerk, the chapel which his mother Ricoldie had built at Walsingham,\nwith other possessions, requesting him to found a priory there. It\nbecame one of the richest in the world. From the very commencement there\nwas an unceasing flow of pilgrims from all nations to it. Several kings\nand queens of England, and among them Henry VIII., paid their devotions\nthere. Erasmus, who visited the priory in 1511, derided its enormous\nwealth. Parts of the road leading to this priory are known to this day\nas the “Walsingham Way” and the “Palmer’s Way.” It is said more pilgrims\ncame to Walsingham than to the shrine of St. Thomas à Becket at\nCanterbury. The monks taught the people that the “Milky Way” pointed to\nthe shrine. Hence the Norfolk people called it the “Walsingham Way.\"\nThis shrine was destroyed at the dissolution of monasteries in 1539.",

The latter made it his home, altering it very little, but\nallowing the church to fall into ruins. The monks, before leaving their\nold home, hid the charters in the lectern, which they threw into the\nlake. About 100 years ago the lectern, still containing the charters,\nwas discovered, and is now being used at Southwell. The “Wicked Lord\nByron,” the grand-uncle of the poet, allowed the abbey to fall into\ndecay, and to spite his sons cut down a large number of splendid oaks.\nByron succeeded to the estate when a mere boy, and loved it so much\nthat, even when in great need of money, he refused to part with it. At\nlast he was obliged to sell the home, which he has so vividly portrayed\nin verse, to his old school friend Colonel Wildman.

        "The second marquess was a mechanical genius, who invented what was known\nas a “Water-commanding Engine.” He erected an apparatus in the moat\nwhich spouted water as high as the top of the castle. This was the first\npractical attempt to use steam as a mechanical agent. The marquess also\nused his various mechanical contrivances to terrify a body of villagers\nwho came to search the castle for arms in the cause of the Parliament.\nWhen the machines were set agoing the rustics fled, believing lions or\nsome other forms of wild animals were after them. This marquess died in\nLondon in 1667, and was buried in Raglan Church.",

Worn out by the persecutions of his enemies, he died by\nhis own hand in 1774, when only in his forty-ninth year. “Great in\ncouncil, great in war, great in his exploits, which were many, and great\nin his faults, which were few,” Sir Charles Wilson says, “Clive will\never be remembered as the man who laid deeply the foundations of our\nIndian Empire, and who, in a time of national despondency, restored the\ntarnished honour of the British arms.”",
        "The parish church of Moreton Say contains Clive’s tomb besides other old\nmonuments dating from 1600, though the church itself is chiefly\neighteenth-century work.

The stream is eventually discovered boiling over mossy\nstones in the green shade of the close-growing trees filling the deep\nvalley. The quieter pools are frequently taken advantage of by a\nhard-pressed stag, for this particular piece of country is frequently\nhunted over by the Devon and Somerset staghounds, some of the most\npopular meets of the season being held at Cloutsham farm, on one of the\nslopes of the Horner valley.

        "One of the very earliest forms of bridge in England is to be seen on the\nbeautiful river Barle, about 7 miles above Dulverton. Torr Steps (the\nname is locally pronounced Tarr) are a distinct advance upon\nstepping-stones, for although the entire bridge is submerged in\nflood-time, there are, in ordinary conditions, seventeen spans raised\nclear above the level of the water. The great stones which form the\npiers support slabs averaging from 6 to 8 feet in length. In the centre\nthese are about 3 feet 6 inches wide, and the piers are supported by\nsloping stones to resist the force of the current. At the ends of the\nbridge the slabs are narrower, and are placed in pairs side by side,\nthus giving the advantage of the greatest weight where the force of the\nstream is most strongly felt. No traces of cement can be found among the\nstones, so that the structure has preserved itself purely by the weight\nof its individual parts.",
        "Although it is impossible to make any definite statement as to the date\nof Torr Steps, it is probable that they were built by the Celtish\ninhabitants of this part of the west country, the bridge having been on\nthe beaten track between one or two important centres. The size of the\nstones does not raise any obstacle to this theory, for though of great\nweight, they are not so unwieldy as the majority of those forming\nStonehenge, which is generally accepted as the work of an exceedingly\nearly race of sun-worshipping men. The name “Torr” is possibly derived\nfrom the Celtic word “Tochar,” a causeway, modified to “Toher” and then\nto “Torr.” The lanes leading from Dulverton to the village of Hawkridge,\nabout 1-1/2 miles from the steps, are exceedingly beautiful, and the\nwhole course of the river Barle is remarkable for the striking charm of\nits woodland scenery, which is frequently contrasted with the wild\nmoorland commons on the hillsides above.",

At the bottom of the hill is\nthe village smithy, the well, a farm, and facing a big elm tree is the\ninn, bearing a great hatchment-like signboard showing the Fauconberg\narms and motto. The cottages of the villagers are on the slope of the\nhill, and at the top is the church to which Sterne was appointed vicar\nin 1760. Close at hand is the quaint seventeenth-century house he\noccupied. It is a singularly picturesque little building, with its mossy\nstone-covered roof, its wide gables, and massive chimney-stacks. Sterne,\nin his humorous way, called it “Shandy Hall.” The stone tablet over the\ndoorway states that Sterne wrote Tristram Shandy and A Sentimental\nJourney at Shandy Hall; but this is not quite accurate, for he entered\nupon the incumbency of Coxwold in 1760, whereas two volumes of Tristram\nShandy had already been published in 1759. Of his life at Coxwold one\ngathers that the vicar was more devoted to his books than to his parish.\nIn the intervals of writing and his clerical duties he amused himself\nwith painting, fiddling, dining out and telling stories, at the same\ntime suffering from ill-health and other discomforts. His gift of\nhumour, however, helped him to bear his troubles better than might\notherwise have been the case. He was firmly persuaded that “every time a\nman smiles, but much more so when he laughs, he adds something to the\nfragment of life.” Sterne’s study may still be seen. It is a tiny room\nwith a low ceiling, although it undoubtedly possesses the charm of\ncosiness. On one occasion Sterne writes: “I have a hundred hens and\nchickens about my yard, and not a parishioner catches a hare or a rabbit\nor a trout but he brings it as an offering to me.” Sterne died in London\nin 1768 at the age of 55 years.",

During the Civil War it was\nheld for the King; but after the battle of Marston Moor it was taken by\nFairfax, and dismantled by order of Parliament in 1648.",
        "The castle, one of the finest of its kind, is situated in a remarkable\nposition on a lofty rock, and was once practically inaccessible. It was\nformerly flanked by eleven towers, of which only one remains. The other\nruins consist of a small portion of the keep and some very beautiful and\nelaborate vaulted apartments, in which the murderers of Thomas à Becket\ntook refuge. On the cliffs opposite the castle is the famous\nKnaresborough “Dripping Well,” whose waters have the property of\n\"turning into stone” any articles left for a time under the dripping\nwaters of the well. The water being highly charged with limestone in a\nstate of impervious powder, rapidly encrusts the object until it appears\nto be made of solid rock, and various specimens of this result may be\nobtained.",
        "About half a mile below the castle are the remains of the priory for\nbrothers of the Holy Trinity, founded by Richard Plantagenet; and\nfurther south, hewn out of the solid rock, at a considerable height\nabove the river Nidd, is St. Robert’s Chapel, with a fine groined roof.\nIt has an altar on the east side and contains carvings of the Trinity\nand the Virgin Mary.",

The abbey is noted for the great extent of its\nremains, which seem to have escaped any wanton destruction. A fine tower\nat the north end of the transept still stands, but the central one has\nfallen into great decay. Besides the church there are many remains of\nthis famous abbey, which at the time of the dissolution of the\nmonasteries was one of the richest in the country.

There are also remains\nof the chapter-house, the refectory, and the kitchen with its two wide\nfireplaces.",
        "The history of the foundation of Fountains Abbey is of considerable\ninterest. In the twelfth century some monks of the Benedictine monastery\nof St. Mary at York, being attracted by the sanctity of the inmates of\nthe Cistercian abbey of Rievaulx in Yorkshire, became dissatisfied with\ntheir own form of government, and wished to adopt the rules of Rievaulx\nAbbey and withdraw from their own monastery. This naturally did not\nplease their abbot; but eventually, after appealing to the Archbishop of\nYork, some land in a lonely valley, known as Skell Dale, was granted to\nthem. Here, in the depth of winter, without shelter or means of\nsubsistence, the pious monks suffered great hardship. After a few years\nHugh, Dean of York, left all his possessions to the Abbey of Fountains,\nand after this endowments and benefactions flowed in.",
        "In 1140 the abbey was burnt down, but in 1204 the restoration was\nrecommenced, and the foundations of a new church, of which the present\nruins are the remains, were laid. The great tower, however, was not\ncompleted till the end of the fourteenth century.",

It recovered quickly from all these\nadversities, and is now a peaceful town given up to agricultural\npursuits. Besides possessing a small but interesting old cathedral and\nsome ancient houses in its town, many places of historic importance lie\nin its immediate neighbourhood. Fountains Abbey is 3 miles distant (see\nIndex), and also Fountains Hall, a fifteenth-century building.

        "Ripon’s minster became a cathedral in 1836. In the seventh century a\nmonastery was established here, and St. Wilfrid, the famous Archbishop\nof York, built the minster. Of this building only the crypt remains,\nconsisting of a central chamber with niches in the walls, and a window\nknown as “St. Wilfrid’s Needle” looking into the passage outside. It is\nreached by steps and a long passage leading from the nave of the present\ncathedral. Only the chapter-house and vestry remain of Archbishop\nThurstan’s Norman church, erected in the place of the Anglo-Saxon one,\nfor Roger, Archbishop of York, pulled it down and began to erect the\npresent building in (_circa_) 1154. Being only a Collegiate Church in\nthose days, it was not built in a cathedral fashion, and it had no\naisles to its wide and low-roofed nave. The present aisles were added in\nthe sixteenth century, with the intention of giving a cathedral aspect\nto the minster church.

Past the church and the lonely\nparsonage are the wide moors, high, wild, and desolate, up above the\nworld, solitary and silent. This gray, sad-looking parsonage, so close\nto the still sadder churchyard, is a spot of more than ordinary\ninterest, for it was the home of the Brontës–that wonderfully gifted\nand extraordinary family! Charlotte Brontë shared with her sisters their\nintense love for the wild, black, purple moors, rising and sweeping away\nyet higher than the church which is built at the summit of the one long\nnarrow street. All round the horizon are wave-like hills. Jane Eyre,\npublished in 1847, written with extraordinary power and wonderful\ngenius, astonished the entire reading world. Little did any one imagine\nthat the authoress lived far away from the busy haunts of men in a quiet\nnorthern parsonage, leading a gentle, sad life; for her two sisters,\nwhom Charlotte loved as her own life, were very delicate, and their one\nbrother, in whom they had placed great hopes, had given way to drink.\nCharlotte was known to the literary world as Currer Bell, her sisters as\nActon and Ellis Bell. After Jane Eyre came Shirley, written in a\nperiod of great sorrow, for her two loved sisters died within a short\nspace of each other, not long after the death of their unhappy brother,\nand Charlotte was left alone in the quiet, sad parsonage with only her\naged father.

Flambard also saw the two western\ntowers finished as high as the roof of the nave. The beautiful\ntransitional Norman Galilee Chapel at the west end was built prior to\n1195 by Hugh Pudsey.

The name implies “on the rock,” and every year it is a\ngreat attraction to the many visitors to Wales, because of the fine\nmountain and sea view obtained from this commanding height. Like many\nother Welsh castles it owes its origin to Edward I. after his conquest\nof Wales. Owen Glyndwr or Glendower, a Welsh prince and a descendant of\nLlewelyn, had rebelled against Henry IV. in consequence of repeated\ninjustice done to him by Lord Grey de Ruthin, who had appropriated his\nestates. As Owen could obtain no redress from the king he took his cause\ninto his own hands, and in 1404 seized the important stronghold of\nHarlech Castle. Four years later it was retaken by the royal forces. At\nfirst Owen Glendower was successful, but eventually he had to flee to\nthe mountains. During the Wars of the Roses, when the Duke of York\ndefeated Henry VI., Queen Margaret fled to Harlech Castle, but after a\nlengthened siege in 1468, the defenders had to yield to the victorious\nforces of the “White Rose.” It is said that this siege gave rise to the\nfavourite Welsh air known as the “March of the Men of Harlech.” The\ncastle stands high, is square, with a round tower at each corner, and\ngives one the impression of massive proportions and enormous strength.\nThe main entrance to the inner ward is between two huge round towers,\nand the passage was defended at one end by two, and at the inner\nextremity by a third, portcullis. The ascent to the top of the walls is\nmade by a stair from the courtyard. There is a well-protected walk on\nthe battlements. The view from the castle is magnificent and extensive,\nand should the day be fine it is one vast panorama of mountain, sea, and\ncoast-line–a sight not easily forgotten. Across the bay, 7 miles off,\ncan be seen the equally ancient castle of Criccieth, although its ruins\ncannot compare to Harlech.

        "Grasmere is the name of a village and lake in Westmorland, about 3 miles\nnorth-west of Ambleside.

It is restored, as far as possible, to its\ncondition in Wordsworth’s day, and contains a number of relics of the\npoet’s family. The lake, a mile in length, and surrounded by mountains,\nforms one of the most beautiful scenes in England. Wordsworth afterwards\nremoved to Rydal Mount (two or three miles off), which place remains\nespecially associated with his memory. It is a somewhat remarkable fact\nthat this quiet and thoughtful interpreter of nature was in the early\nyears of his life, while going on a pedestrian tour through France,\nthrust into the early fervours of its great Revolution. Wordsworth’s\nsympathy with the aims of the Gironde party might have cost him his\nlife, for many of his friends in Paris suffered death, but happily\ncircumstances caused him to return to England. It was his noble sister\nDorothy, his constant and devoted companion, who met him on his return\nfrom Paris, broken-hearted, and induced him to return to nature.",
        "Wordsworth’s poetry was not appreciated for a considerable time, but he\ncalmly wrote on, undismayed by the ridicule poured forth on the “Lake\nSchool of Poets,” which included Coleridge and Southey, and gradually\nhis calm and dignified descriptions of nature asserted their rightful\ninfluence. After publishing his greatest poem, The Excursion, the tide\nof generous appreciation set in. In 1843, Wordsworth was made Poet\nLaureate. His pure and fervent poetry was a protest against the diseased\nsentimentality of the age.",

The cathedral, originally\nbuilt in 1176, is curiously situated in a deep dell, so that only the\nupper part of the lofty tower is visible from the village, and the close\nis entered by descending thirty-nine steps, locally known as the\nthirty-nine articles.

The situation chosen was on the banks of a stream flowing\nthrough a narrow fertile valley–the favourite position for Cistercian\nabbeys. The monks came originally from Savigny in Normandy. Having\nbecome very richly endowed, the foundation of the abbey was confirmed by\nthe charters of twelve successive sovereigns and the bulls of various\npopes. Remarkable privileges were given to the abbot, who had great\nauthority in the whole of the surrounding district, even the military\nelement being, to a certain extent, dependent upon him.",
        "A register known as the Abbot’s Mortuary was kept at Furness throughout\nthree centuries. This was almost unique among Cistercian monasteries,\nfor only names of those abbots who, having presided for ten years,\ncontinued at the abbey and died abbots there, were entered in the\nregister. During 277 years, therefore, only ten names were written upon\nthe pages. When Henry VIII., in 1537, suppressed Furness Abbey, it was\nsurrendered by Roger Pyke, who was abbot at the time.",
        "The ruins of the abbey to be seen to-day are of Norman and Early English\ncharacter, and the general hue of the stone-work is a ruddy brown. Their\nmassive appearance almost suggests a shattered castle; but the share the\nabbey took in military matters is better illustrated from the fact that\nthey built a watch-tower on the top of a hill rising from the walls of\nthe monastery, and commanding a view over the sea and the whole district\nknown as Low Furness. From this height the monks on watch were enabled\nto give warning by signals of the approach of an enemy.

Bede, who was born in 673\nA.D., was placed, at the age of seven years, in the monastery at\nMonkwearmouth, from which he went to Jarrow, to the new monastery just\nbuilt by Benedict Biscop. He remained at Jarrow for the rest of his\nlife, studying the Scriptures and writing books. His greatest work was\nthe Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, which has given him\nhis position as the father of English history. The story of his death is\nvery beautiful. He was translating St. John’s Gospel into English when\nhe was attacked by a sudden illness, and felt he was dying. He kept on\nwith his task, however, and continued dictating to his scribe, bidding\nhim write quickly. When he was told that the book was finished he said,\n\"You speak truth, all is finished now,” and after singing “Glory to\nGod,” he quietly passed away.",
        "The abbey churches of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow are interesting, because\nthey have remained practically unaltered from their construction in the\nseventh century. The monasteries never grew sufficiently to require\ngreat enlargements, and thus they would have been to-day very nearly as\nthe Anglo-Saxon monks saw them. Monkwearmouth Church was built in the\nRomanesque style by Benedict Biscop, who sent to France for workmen to\nput in the glass for the church windows. Besides the church, no trace\nremains of any monastic building at Monkwearmouth. The chancel and tower\nof the abbey church at Jarrow bear a great resemblance to those of\nMonkwearmouth, both being the work of Benedict Biscop.

        "Bassenthwaite Water, connected with Derwentwater by the Derwent, is a\nsmaller lake, but exceedingly beautiful, and Buttermere has a quaint\nlittle village which goes by the same name.",
        "Among the many places within easy reach of Keswick are Cockermouth, the\nbirthplace of Wordsworth; Wytheburn, the nearest village to Thirlmere;\nand Skiddaw, the ascent of which can be accomplished with comparative\nease on pony-back. The summit is over 3000 feet above sea-level.",

It has a long\nbattlemented roof and massive square tower, and possesses many old\nbrasses and monuments, besides a font of the time of Edward III. To most\npeople the monument to Southey will be the chief object of interest. It\nis a recumbent figure, with an epitaph in verse by his life-long friend\nWordsworth.",
        "Robert Southey was the son of a Bristol linen-draper, and was educated\nat Westminster and Balliol. Southey and Coleridge were much associated\nwith Lovell, a Bristol Quaker. These three friends made a plan–never\ncarried out–of going to the wilds of America and returning to the\npatriarchal manner of living. They all married three sisters named\nFricker. Unfortunately Southey’s wife died insane, and he then married a\nvery talented lady named Catherine Bowles. In the beginning of the\neighteenth century the Southeys and Coleridges settled in the same house\nat Greta, near Keswick, and Mrs. Lovell, widow of Robert Lovell, and her\nson joined the household. Here Southey lived till his death in 1843. In\n1813 he was made Poet Laureate, and later was given a pension of £300 a\nyear.",

It is believed that a fort existed here\nduring the Roman occupation, and that a castle was erected on its site\nby the Saxons, who named the place Ealnwic. Just before the Conquest\nthe castle and barony were the property of one Gilbert Tyson, who was\nslain at the battle of Hastings. His possessions passed into the hands\nof the Norman lords De Vesci, who held them till about 1297, when the\ncastle and barony were bequeathed by the licence of Edward I. to the\nBishop of Durham. Shortly afterwards they were purchased by Lord Henry\nde Percy, from whom they have descended regularly to the present owner,\nthe Duke of Northumberland. The castle is one of the finest examples of\na feudal fortress in England, the walls enclosing an area of five acres,\nand the grounds, watered by the Alne, presenting scenes of the most\nvaried and romantic beauty.",
        "The two north-western round towers of the keep, together with the\nArmourer’s and Falconer’s towers, have recently been swept away in order\nto accommodate the new Prudhoe Tower.

        "Alnwick, situated so near the border, was the scene of countless raids\nand conflicts during the Middle Ages, and with these fights the castle\nwas always closely associated. It was besieged in 1093 by Malcolm III.,\nKing of Scotland, and defended by Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland. The\nScottish king and his son Prince Edward both fell during the siege. King\nDavid gained possession of the town in 1135. William the Lion, who took\npart with young Richard, afterwards Coeur de Lion, against his father\nHenry II., entered Northumberland in 1174, with 80,000 men, and laid\nsiege to Alnwick; but the attempt was a failure, and William was taken\nprisoner.",

        "St. Ives is a quiet, old-world fishing town on the northern coast of\nCornwall. The town occupies the western limb of the wide bay of St.\nIves. On the narrow neck of land joining the promontory known as The\nIsland to the mainland, most of the houses of the fishing town are\npacked away in picturesque confusion, while the streets are tortuous in\nthe extreme. On either side of this isthmus the land rises; behind it\nthunder the waves on Porthmeor beach; in front are the deep green waters\nof the harbour, protected by two piers. The beach is of firm, hard sand,\nupon which the boats are hauled up in safety. The fifteenth-century\nchurch, standing on the site of the former Norman chapel, is a large\nbuilding near the harbour. It is said that the Norman structure was\ndedicated to St. Ivo, a Persian bishop, who is supposed to have\nChristianised the Britons in Cornwall in the ninth century, and to have\nerected six chapels. Others think that St. Ia was the daughter of an\nIrish chieftain, and was murdered at Hayle. The beautiful font is\nthought to be a relic from the former chapel. A fifteenth-century cross\nhas been dug up in the churchyard and re-erected. On the island is a\nlittle building which is thought to be the remains of one of St. Ivo’s\nchapels. There is also a fort of Cornu-British origin, and a\ngrass-covered battery on the hill, whose green slopes are covered with\nfishing-nets.

        "Standing on an almost perpendicular mass of basaltic rock, overlooking\nthe sea at a height of 150 feet, is Bamborough Castle. The stately keep\nbelongs to the original stronghold, which was built on the site of what\nwas probably one of a chain of fortresses raised by the Romans for the\nprotection of the coast. For many centuries the castle was possessed of\ngreat strength, and was frequently used as a place of refuge by the\nKings and Earls of Northumberland. It was founded by Ida, king of the\nAngles, about A.D. 547, and suffered considerably at the hands of the\nDanes in 933. Earlier than this, however, in the seventh century,\nBamborough was besieged by Penda, the pagan king of Mercia, who,\nalthough having recently gained several victories, made great efforts to\nburn down the castle. Having set his men to work to accumulate a great\nmass of brushwood, Penda had huge piles heaped up beneath the walls. As\nsoon as the wind was in the right quarter he set alight the brushwood.\nShortly afterwards, however, the wind veered round until it blew in the\nopposite direction, to the discomfiture of his own people, who were thus\nobliged to abandon their camp.",
        "Afterwards the castle was repaired again, and was besieged by William\nII. when Robert Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, took refuge there.\nDuring the Wars of the Roses Bamborough was frequently captured and\nrecaptured, and in the various sieges suffered very severely.",
