        "It is usual, in voyages round the Cape from the Pacific, to keep\nto the eastward of the Falkland Islands; but as it had now set in\na strong, steady, and clear south-wester, with every prospect of\nits lasting, and we had had enough of high latitudes, the captain\ndetermined to stand immediately to the northward, running inside\nthe Falkland Islands.  Accordingly, when the wheel was relieved at\neight o’clock, the order was given to keep her due north, and all\nhands were turned up to square away the yards and make sail.\nIn a moment, the news ran through the ship that the captain was\nkeeping her off, with her nose straight for Boston, and Cape Horn\nover her taffrail.  It was a moment of enthusiasm.  Every one was\non the alert, and even the two sick men turned out to lend a hand\nat the halyards.  The wind was now due south-west, and blowing\na gale to which a vessel close hauled could have shown no more\nthan a single close-reefed sail; but as we were going before it,\nwe could carry on.",
        "Accordingly, hands were sent aloft, and a reef shaken out of the\ntop-sails, and the reefed foresail set.  When we came to masthead\nthe topsail yards, with all hands at the halyards, we struck up\n“Cheerily, men,” with a chorus which might have been heard half-way\nto Staten Land.  Under her increased sail, the ship drove on through\nthe water.  Yet she could bear it well; and the captain sang out from\nthe quarter-deck–\"Another reef out of that fore-topsail, and give\nit to her!”  Two hands sprang aloft; the frozen reef-points and\nearings were cast adrift, the halyards manned, and the sail gave\nout her increased canvas to the gale.  All hands were kept on\ndeck to watch the effect of the change.  It was as much as she\ncould well carry, and with a heavy sea astern, it took two men\nat the wheel to steer her.  She flung the foam from her bows;\nthe spray breaking aft as far as the gangway.  She was going at\na prodigious rate.",
        "Still, everything held.  Preventer braces were reeved and hauled\ntaught; tackles got upon the backstays; and each thing done to\nkeep all snug and strong.  The captain walked the deck at a rapid\nstride, looked aloft at the sails, and then to windward; the mate\nstood in the gangway, rubbing his hands, and talking aloud to the\nship–\"Hurrah, old bucket! the Boston girls have got hold of the\ntow-rope!” and the like; and we were on the forecastle, looking\nto see how the spars stood it, and guessing the rate at which\nshe was going,–when the captain called out–\"Mr. Brown, get up\nthe topmast studding-sail!  What she can’t carry she may drag!\"\nThe mate looked a moment; but he would let no one be before him\nin daring.",
        "He sprang forward–\"Hurrah, men! rig out the topmast studding-sail\nboom!  Lay aloft, and I’ll send the rigging up to you!\"–We sprang\naloft into the top; lowered a girt-line down, by which we hauled\nup the rigging; rove the tacks and halyards; ran out the boom and\nlashed it fast, and sent down the lower halyards, as a preventer.\nIt was a clear starlight night, cold and blowing; but everybody\nworked with a will.  Some, indeed, looked as though they thought\nthe “old man” was mad, but no one said a word.  We had had a new\ntopmast studding-sail made with a reef in it,–a thing hardly\never heard of, and which the sailors had ridiculed a good deal,\nsaying that when it was time to reef a studding-sail, it was time\nto take it in.  But we found a use for it now; for, there being\na reef in the topsail, the studding-sail could not be set without\none in it also.  To be sure, a studding-sail with reefed topsails\nwas rather a new thing; yet there was some reason in it, for if\nwe carried that away, we should lose only a sail and a boom;\nbut a whole topsail might have carried away the mast and all.",
        "While we were aloft, the sail had been got out, bent to the yard,\nreefed, and ready for hoisting.  Waiting for a good opportunity,\nthe halyards were manned and the yard hoisted fairly up to the\nblock; but when the mate came to shake the catspaw out of the\ndownhaul, and we began to boom-end the sail, it shook the ship\nto her centre.  The boom buckled up and bent like a whip-stick,\nand we looked every moment to see something go; but, being of\nthe short, tough upland spruce, it bent like whalebone, and nothing\ncould break it.  The carpenter said it was the best stick he had\never seen.  The strength of all hands soon brought the tack to\nthe boom-end, and the sheet was trimmed down, and the preventer\nand the weather brace hauled taught to take off the strain.\nEvery rope-yarn seemed stretched to the utmost, and every thread\nof canvas; and with this sail added to her, the ship sprang through\nthe water like a thing possessed.  The sail being nearly all forward,\nit lifted her out of the water, and she seemed actually to jump from\nsea to sea.  From the time her keel was laid, she had never been so\ndriven; and had it been life or death with every one of us, she could\nnot have borne another stitch of canvas.",
        "Finding that she would bear the sail, the hands were sent below,\nand our watch remained on deck.  Two men at the wheel had as much\nas they could do to keep her within three points of her course,\nfor she steered as wild as a young colt.  The mate walked the deck,\nlooking at the sails, and then over the side to see the foam fly\nby her, slapping his hands upon his thighs and talking to the\nship–\"Hurrah, you jade, you’ve got the scent!–you know where\nyou’re going!”  And when she leaped over the seas, and almost\nout of the water, and trembled to her very keel, the spars\nand masts snapping and creaking,–\"There she goes!–There she\ngoes,–handsomely!–as long as she cracks she holds!\"–while we\nstood with the rigging laid down fair for letting go, and ready\nto take in sail and clear away, if anything went.  At four bells\nwe hove the log, and she was going eleven knots fairly; and had it\nnot been for the sea from aft which sent the ship home, and threw\nher continually off her course, the log would have shown her to\nhave been going much faster.  I went to the wheel with a young\nfellow from the Kennebec, who was a good helmsman; and for two\nhours we had our hands full.  A few minutes showed us that our\nmonkey-jackets must come off; and, cold as it was, we stood in\nour shirt-sleeves, in a perspiration; and were glad enough to have\nit eight bells, and the wheel relieved.  We turned-in and slept\nas well as we could, though the sea made a constant roar under\nher bows, and washed over the forecastle like a small cataract.",
        "At four o’clock, we were called again.  The same sail was still on\nthe vessel, and the gale, if there was any change, had increased\na little.  No attempt was made to take the studding-sail in;\nand, indeed, it was too late now.  If we had started anything\ntoward taking it in, either tack or halyards, it would have blown\nto pieces, and carried something away with it.  The only way now was\nto let everything stand, and if the gale went down, well and good;\nif not, something must go–the weakest stick or rope first–and\nthen we could get it in.  For more than an hour she was driven on\nat such a rate that she seemed actually to crowd the sea into a\nheap before her; and the water poured over the spritsail yard as\nit would over a dam.  Toward daybreak the gale abated a little,\nand she was just beginning to go more easily along, relieved of\nthe pressure, when Mr. Brown, determined to give her no respite,\nand depending upon the wind’s subsiding as the sun rose, told us\nto get along the lower studding-sail.  This was an immense sail,\nand held wind enough to last a Dutchman a week,–hove-to.  It was\nsoon ready, the boom topped up, preventer guys rove, and the idlers\ncalled up to man the halyards; yet such was still the force of the\ngale, that we were nearly an hour setting the sail; carried away the\nouthaul in doing it, and came very near snapping off the swinging\nboom.  No sooner was it set than the ship tore on again like one\nthat was mad, and began to steer as wild as a hawk.  The men at\nthe wheel were puffing and blowing at their work, and the helm was\ngoing hard up and hard down, constantly.  Add to this, the gale\ndid not lessen as the day came on, but the sun rose in clouds.\nA sudden lurch threw the man from the weather wheel across the deck\nand against the side.  The mate sprang to the wheel, and the man,\nregaining his feet, seized the spokes, and they hove the wheel up\njust in time to save her from broaching to; though nearly half\nthe studding-sail went under water; and as she came to, the boom\nstood up at an angle of forty five degrees.  She had evidently\nmore on her than she could bear; yet it was in vain to try to\ntake it in–the clewline was not strong enough; and they were\nthinking of cutting away, when another wide yaw and a come-to,\nsnapped the guys, and the swinging boom came in, with a crash,\nagainst the lower rigging.  The outhaul block gave way, and the\ntopmast studding-sail boom bent in a manner which I never before\nsupposed a stick could bend.  I had my eye on it when the guys\nparted, and it made one spring and buckled up so as to form nearly\na half circle, and sprang out again to its shape.",
        "The clewline gave way at the first pull; the cleat to which the\nhalyards were belayed was wrenched off, and the sail blew round\nthe spritsail yards and head guys, which gave us a bad job to\nget it in.",
        "A half hour served to clear all away, and she was suffered to drive\non with her topmast studding-sail set, it being as much as she could\nstagger under. ",
        "During all this day and the next night, we went on under the same\nsail, the gale blowing with undiminished force; two men at the wheel\nall the time; watch and watch, and nothing to do but to steer and\nlook out for the ship, and be blown along;–until the noon of the\nnext day–",
        "Sunday, July 24th, when we were in latitude 50° 27’ S., longitude\n62° 13’ W., having made four degrees of latitude in the last\ntwenty-four hours.  Being now to northward of the Falkland Islands,\nthe ship was kept off, north-east, for the equator; and with her\nhead for the equator, and Cape Horn over her taffrail, she went\ngloriously on; every heave of the sea leaving the Cape astern,\nand every hour bringing us nearer to home, and to warm weather.\nMany a time, when blocked up in the ice, with everything dismal\nand discouraging about us, had we said,–if we were only fairly\nround, and standing north on the other side, we should ask for\nno more:–and now we had it all, with a clear sea, and as much\nwind as a sailor could pray for.  If the best part of the voyage\nis the last part, surely we had all now that we could wish.\nEvery one was in the highest spirits, and the ship seemed as\nglad as any of us at getting out of her confinement.  At each\nchange of the watch, those coming on deck asked those going\nbelow–\"How does she go along?” and got for answer, the rate,\nand the customary addition–\"Aye! and the Boston girls have had hold\nof the tow-rope all the watch, and can’t haul half the slack in!\"\nEach day the sun rose higher in the horizon, and the nights grew\nshorter; and at coming on deck each morning, there was a sensible\nchange in the temperature.  The ice, too, began to melt from off\nthe rigging and spars, and, except a little which remained in the\ntops and round the hounds of the lower masts, was soon gone.  As we\nleft the gale behind us, the reefs were shaken out of the topsails,\nand sail made as fast as she could bear it; and every time all hands\nwere sent to the halyards, a song was called for, and we hoisted\naway with a will.",
        "Sail after sail was added, as we drew into fine weather; and in\none week after leaving Cape Horn, the long topgallant masts were\ngot up, topgallant and royal yards crossed, and the ship restored\nto her fair proportions.",
        "The Southern Cross we saw no more after the first night; the\nMagellan Clouds settled lower and lower in the horizon; and so\ngreat was our change of latitude each succeeding night, that we\nsank some constellation in the south, and raised another in the\nnorthern horizon.",
        "Sunday, July 31st.  At noon we were in lat. 36° 41’ S., long.\n38° 08’ W.; having traversed the distance of two thousand miles,\nallowing for changes of course, in nine days.  A thousand miles\nin four days and a half!–This is equal to steam.",
        "Soon after eight o’clock, the appearance of the ship gave evidence\nthat this was the first Sunday we had yet had in fine weather.\nAs the sun came up clear, with the promise of a fair, warm day,\nand, as usual on Sunday, there was no work going on, all hands\nturned-to upon clearing out the forecastle.  The wet and soiled\nclothes which had accumulated there during the past month, were\nbrought up on deck; the chests moved; brooms, buckets of water,\nswabs, scrubbing-brushes, and scrapers carried down, and applied,\nuntil the forecastle floor was as white as chalk, and everything\nneat and in order.  The bedding from the berths was then spread on\ndeck, and dried, and aired; the deck-tub filled with water; and a\ngrand washing begun of all the clothes which were brought up.\nShirts, frocks, drawers, trowsers, jackets, stockings, of every\nshape and color, wet and dirty–many of them mouldy from having\nbeen lying a long time wet in a foul corner–these were all washed\nand scrubbed out, and finally towed overboard for half an hour;\nand then made fast in the rigging to dry.  Wet boots and shoes\nwere spread out to dry in sunny places on deck; and the whole\nship looked like a back yard on a washing day.  After we had\ndone with our clothes, we began upon our own persons.  A little\nfresh water, which we had saved from our allowance, was put in\nbuckets, and with soap and towels, we had what sailors call\na fresh-water wash.  The same bucket, to be sure, had to go\nthrough several hands, and was spoken for by one after another,\nbut as we rinsed off in salt water, pure from the ocean, and the\nfresh was used only to start the accumulated grime and blackness\nof five weeks, it was held of little consequence.",
        "We soaped down and scrubbed one another with towels and pieces\nof canvas, stripping to it; and then, getting into the head,\nthrew buckets of water upon each other.  After this, came shaving,\nand combing, and brushing; and when, having spent the first part of\nthe day in this way, we sat down on the forecastle, in the afternoon,\nwith clean duck trowsers, and shirts on, washed, shaved, and combed,\nand looking a dozen shades lighter for it, reading, sewing, and\ntalking at our ease, with a clear sky and warm sun over our heads,\na steady breeze over the larboard quarter, studding-sails out alow\nand aloft, and all the flying kites aboard;–we felt that we had\ngot back into the pleasantest part of a sailor’s life.  At sundown\nthe clothes were all taken down from the rigging–clean and dry–and\nstowed neatly away in our chests; and our southwesters, thick boots,\nguernsey frocks, and other accompaniments of bad weather, put out\nof the way, we hoped, for the rest of the voyage, as we expected\nto come upon the coast early in the autumn.",
        "Notwithstanding all that has been said about the beauty of a\nship under full sail, there are very few who have ever seen\na ship, literally, under all her sail.  A ship coming in or\ngoing out of port, with her ordinary sails, and perhaps two of\nthree studding-sails, is commonly said to be under full sail;\nbut a ship never has all her sail upon her, except when she has\na light, steady breeze, very nearly, but not quite, dead aft,\nand so regular that it can be trusted, and is likely to last\nfor some time.  Then, with all her sails, light and heavy, and\nstudding-sails, on each side, alow and aloft, she is the most\nglorious moving object in the world.  Such a sight, very few,\neven some who have been at sea a great deal, have ever beheld;\nfor from the deck of your own vessel you cannot see her, as you\nwould a separate object.",
        "One night, while we were in these tropics, I went out to the end\nof the flying-jib-boom, upon some duty, and, having finished it,\nturned round, and lay over the boom for a long time, admiring the\nbeauty of the sight before me.  Being so far out from the deck,\nI could look at the ship, as at a separate vessel;–and there rose\nup from the water, supported only by the small black hull, a pyramid\nof canvas, spreading out far beyond the hull, and towering up almost,\nas it seemed in the indistinct night air, to the clouds.  The sea\nwas as still as an inland lake; the light trade-wind was gently and\nsteadily breathing from astern; the dark blue sky was studded with\nthe tropical stars; there was no sound but the rippling of the water\nunder the stem; and the sails were spread out, wide and high;–the\ntwo lower studding-sails stretching, on each side, far beyond the deck;\nthe topmast studding-sails, like wings to the topsails; the top-gallant\nstudding-sails spreading fearlessly out above them; still higher,\nthe two royal studding-sails, looking like two kites flying from\nthe same string; and, highest of all, the little skysail, the apex\nof the pyramid, seeming actually to touch the stars, and to be\nout of reach of human hand.  So quiet, too, was the sea, and so\nsteady the breeze, that if these sails had been sculptured marble,\nthey could not have been more motionless.  Not a ripple upon the\nsurface of the canvas; not even a quivering of the extreme edges\nof the sail–so perfectly were they distended by the breeze.\nI was so lost in the sight, that I forgot the presence of the\nman who came out with me, until he said, (for he, too, rough old\nman-of-war’s-man as he was, had been gazing at the show,) half to\nhimself, still looking at the marble sails–\"How quietly they do\ntheir work!”",
        "The fine weather brought work with it; as the ship was to be put in\norder for coming into port.  This may give a landsman some notion\nof what is done on board ship.–All the first part of a passage is\nspent in getting a ship ready for sea, and the last part in getting\nher ready for port.  She is, as sailors say, like a lady’s watch,\nalways out of repair.  The new, strong sails, which we had up off\nCape Horn, were to be sent down, and the old set, which were still\nserviceable in fine weather, to be bent in their place; all the\nrigging to be set up, fore and aft; the masts stayed; the standing\nrigging to be tarred down; lower and topmast rigging rattled down,\nfore and aft; the ship scraped, inside and out, and painted;\ndecks varnished; new and neat knots, seizings and coverings\nto be fitted; and every part put in order, to look well to the\nowner’s eye, on coming into Boston.  This, of course, was a long\nmatter; and all hands were kept on deck at work for the whole of\neach day, during the rest of the voyage.  Sailors call this hard\nusage; but the ship must be in crack order, and “we’re homeward\nbound” was the answer to everything.",
        "We went on for several days, employed in this way, nothing remarkable\noccurring; and, at the latter part of the week, fell in with the\nsouth-east trades, blowing about east-south-east, which brought\nthem nearly two points abaft our beam.  These blew strong and\nsteady, so that we hardly started a rope, until we were beyond\ntheir latitude.  The first day of “all hands,” one of those little\nincidents occurred, which are nothing in themselves, but are great\nmatters in the eyes of a ship’s company, as they serve to break the\nmonotony of a voyage, and afford conversation to the crew for days\nafterwards.  These small matters, too, are often interesting, as they\nshow the customs and state of feeling on shipboard.",
        "In merchant vessels, the captain gives his orders as to the ship’s\nwork, to the mate, in a general way, and leaves the execution of\nthem, with the particular ordering, to him.  This has become so fixed\na custom, that it is like a law, and is never infringed upon by a wise\nmaster, unless his mate is no seaman; in which case, the captain must\noften oversee things for himself.  This, however, could not be said\nof our chief mate; and he was very jealous of any encroachment upon\nthe borders of his authority.",
        "On Monday morning, the captain told him to stay the fore-topmast\nplumb.  He accordingly came forward, turned all hands to, with\ntackles on the stays and back-stays, coming up with the seizings,\nhauling here, belaying there, and full of business, standing between\nthe knightheads to sight the mast,–when the captain came forward,\nand also began to give orders.  This made confusion, and the mate,\nfinding that he was all aback, left his place and went aft, saying to\nthe captain–",
        "“If you come forward, sir, I’ll go aft.  One is enough on the forecastle.” ",
        "This produced a reply, and another fierce answer; and the words flew,\nfists were doubled up, and things looked threateningly. ",
        "“I’m master of this ship.” ",
        "“Yes, sir, and I’m mate of her, and know my place!  My place is\nforward, and yours is aft!” ",
        "“My place is where I choose!  I command the whole ship; and you\nare mate only so long as I choose!” ",
        "“Say the word, Capt. T., and I’m done!  I can do a man’s work\naboard!  I didn’t come through the cabin windows!  If I’m not\nmate, I can be man,” etc., etc.",
        "This was all fun for us, who stood by, winking at each other, and\nenjoying the contest between the higher powers.  The captain took\nthe mate aft; and they had a long talk, which ended in the mate’s\nreturning to his duty.  The captain had broken through a custom,\nwhich is a part of the common-law of a ship, and without reason;\nfor he knew that his mate was a sailor, and needed no help from him;\nand the mate was excusable for being angry.  Yet he was wrong, and\nthe captain right.  Whatever the captain does is right, ipso facto,\nand any opposition to it is wrong, on board ship; and every officer\nand man knows this when he signs the ship’s articles.",
        "It is a part of the contract.  Yet there has grown up in merchant\nvessels a series of customs, which have become a well understood\nsystem, and have almost the force of prescriptive law.  To be sure,\nall power is in the captain, and the officers hold their authority\nonly during his will; and the men are liable to be called upon for\nany service; yet, by breaking in upon these usages, many difficulties\nhave occurred on board ship, and even come into courts of justice,\nwhich are perfectly unintelligible to any one not acquainted with the\nuniversal nature and force of these customs.  Many a provocation has\nbeen offered, and a system of petty oppression pursued towards men,\nthe force and meaning of which would appear as nothing to strangers,\nand doubtless do appear so to many “’long-shore” juries and judges.",
        "The next little diversion, was a battle on the forecastle one\nafternoon, between the mate and the steward.  They had been on\nbad terms the whole voyage; and had threatened a rupture several\ntimes.  This afternoon, the mate asked him for a tumbler of water,\nand he refused to get it for him, saying that he waited upon\nnobody but the captain: and here he had the custom on his side.\nBut in answering, he left off “the handle to the mate’s name.\"\nThis enraged the mate, who called him a “black soger;” and at it\nthey went, clenching, striking, and rolling over and over; while\nwe stood by, looking on, and enjoying the fun.  The darky tried\nto butt him, but the mate got him down, and held him, the steward\nsinging out, “Let me go, Mr. Brown, or there’ll be blood spilt!\"\nIn the midst of this, the captain came on deck, separated them,\ntook the steward aft, and gave him half a dozen with a rope’s end.",
        "The steward tried to justify himself; but he had been heard to talk\nof spilling blood, and that was enough to earn him his flogging;\nand the captain did not choose to inquire any further.",
