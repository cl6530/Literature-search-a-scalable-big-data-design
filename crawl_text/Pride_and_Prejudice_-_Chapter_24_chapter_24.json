        "Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.  The very\nfirst sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled\nin London for the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret\nat not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in\nHertfordshire before he left the country.",
        "Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the\nrest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection\nof the writer, that could give her any comfort.  Miss Darcy’s\npraise occupied the chief of it.  Her many attractions were again\ndwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing\nintimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the\nwishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.  She wrote\nalso with great pleasure of her brother’s being an inmate of Mr.\nDarcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the\nlatter with regard to new furniture.",
        "Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of\nall this, heard it in silent indignation.  Her heart was divided\nbetween concern for her sister, and resentment against all others.\nTo Caroline’s assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss\nDarcy she paid no credit.  That he was really fond of Jane, she\ndoubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had\nalways been disposed to like him, she could not think without\nanger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that\nwant of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his\ndesigning friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\nto the caprice of their inclination.  Had his own happiness,\nhowever, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to\nsport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister’s\nwas involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.\nIt was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long\nindulged, and must be unavailing.  She could think of nothing\nelse; and yet whether Bingley’s regard had really died away, or\nwere suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether he had\nbeen aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\nobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him\nmust be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.",
        "A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her\nfeelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them\ntogether, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield\nand its master, she could not help saying:",
        "“Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!  She\ncan have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual\nreflections on him.  But I will not repine.  It cannot last long.\nHe will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.”",
        "Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but\nsaid nothing.",
        "“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you\nhave no reason.  He may live in my memory as the most amiable\nman of my acquaintance, but that is all.  I have nothing either\nto hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.  Thank God! I\nhave not that pain.  A little time, therefore–I shall certainly\ntry to get the better.”",
        "With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort\nimmediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on\nmy side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.”",
        "“My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good.  Your\nsweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know\nwhat to say to you.  I feel as if I had never done you justice, or\nloved you as you deserve.”",
        "Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and\nthrew back the praise on her sister’s warm affection.",
        "“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair.  You wish to think all\nthe world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.  I\nonly want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it.\nDo not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching\non your privilege of universal good-will.  You need not.  There\nare few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think\nwell.  The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied\nwith it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of\nall human characters, and of the little dependence that can be\nplaced on the appearance of merit or sense.  I have met with two\ninstances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte’s\nmarriage.  It is unaccountable!  In every view it is unaccountable!”",
        "“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.  They\nwill ruin your happiness.  You do not make allowance enough\nfor difference of situation and temper.  Consider Mr. Collins’s\nrespectability, and Charlotte’s steady, prudent character.\nRemember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune,\nit is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for\neverybody’s sake, that she may feel something like regard and\nesteem for our cousin.”",
        "“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no\none else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I\npersuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only\nthink worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.\nMy dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded,\nsilly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel,\nas well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a\nproper way of thinking.  You shall not defend her, though it is\nCharlotte Lucas.  You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\nchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to\npersuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and\ninsensibility of danger security for happiness.”",
        "“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\"\nreplied Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing\nthem happy together.  But enough of this.  You alluded to\nsomething else.  You mentioned two instances.  I cannot\nmisunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain\nme by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion\nof him is sunk.  We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves\nintentionally injured.  We must not expect a lively young man to\nbe always so guarded and circumspect.  It is very often nothing\nbut our own vanity that deceives us.  Women fancy admiration\nmeans more than it does.”",
        "“And men take care that they should.”",
        "“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no\nidea of there being so much design in the world as some persons\nimagine.”",
        "“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to\ndesign,” said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or\nto make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be\nmisery.  Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people’s\nfeelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.”",
        "“And do you impute it to either of those?”",
        "“Yes; to the last.  But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying\nwhat I think of persons you esteem.  Stop me whilst you can.”",
        "“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”",
        "“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”",
        "“I cannot believe it.  Why should they try to influence him?\nThey can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me,\nno other woman can secure it.”",
        "“Your first position is false.  They may wish many things besides\nhis happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and\nconsequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the\nimportance of money, great connections, and pride.”",
        "“Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\"\nreplied Jane; “but this may be from better feelings than you are\nsupposing.  They have known her much longer than they have\nknown me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever\nmay be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have\nopposed their brother’s.  What sister would think herself at\nliberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?\nIf they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part\nus; if he were so, they could not succeed.  By supposing such\nan affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong,\nand me most unhappy.  Do not distress me by the idea.  I am not\nashamed of having been mistaken–or, at least, it is light, it\nis nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill\nof him or his sisters.  Let me take it in the best light, in\nthe light in which it may be understood.”",
        "Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time\nMr. Bingley’s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.",
        "Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning\nno more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did\nnot account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever\nconsidering it with less perplexity.  Her daughter endeavoured\nto convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his\nattentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and\ntransient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but\nthough the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,\nshe had the same story to repeat every day.  Mrs. Bennet’s best\ncomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the\nsummer.",
        "Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.  “So, Lizzy,” said he\none day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find.  I congratulate\nher.  Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in\nlove now and then.  It is something to think of, and it gives her a\nsort of distinction among her companions.  When is your turn to\ncome?  You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.  Now is\nyour time.  Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all\nthe young ladies in the country.  Let Wickham be your man.  He\nis a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”",
        "“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.  We\nmust not all expect Jane’s good fortune.”",
        "“True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that\nwhatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate\nmother who will make the most of it.”",
        "Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the\ngloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many\nof the Longbourn family.  They saw him often, and to his other\nrecommendations was now added that of general unreserve.\nThe whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on\nMr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now\nopenly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody\nwas pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr.\nDarcy before they had known anything of the matter.",
        "Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might\nbe any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the\nsociety of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always\npleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes–but\nby everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.",
