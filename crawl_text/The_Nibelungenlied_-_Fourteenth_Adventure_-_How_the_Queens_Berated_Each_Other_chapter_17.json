        "Before the time of vespers / arose a mickle stir\nOn part of warriors many / upon the courtyard there.\nIn knightly fashion made they / the time go pleasantly;\nThither knights and ladies / went their merry play to see.",
        "815",
        "There did sit together / the queens, a stately pair,\nAnd of two knights bethought them, / that noble warriors were.\nThen spake the fair Kriemhild: / “Such spouse in sooth have I,\nThat all these mighty kingdoms / might well beneath his sceptre lie.”",
        "816",
        "Then spake the Lady Brunhild: / “How might such thing be?\nIf that there lived none other / but himself and thee,\nSo might perchance his power / rule these kingdoms o’er;\nThe while that liveth Gunther, / may such thing be nevermore.”",
        "817",
        "Then again spake Kriemhild: / “Behold how he doth stand\nIn right stately fashion / before the knightly band,\nLike as the bright moon beameth / before the stars of heaven.\nIn sooth to think upon it / a joyous mood to me is given.”",
        "818",
        "Then spake the Lady Brunhild: / “How stately thy spouse be,\nHowe’er so fair and worthy, / yet must thou grant to me\nGunther, thy noble brother, / doth far beyond him go:\nIn sooth before all monarchs / he standeth, shalt thou truly know.”",
        "819",
        "Then again spake Kriemhild: / “So worthy is my spouse,\nThat I not have praised him / here without a cause.\nIn ways to tell full many / high honor doth he bear:\nBelieve well may’st thou, Brunhild, / he is the royal Gunther’s peer.”",
        "820",
        "“Now guard thee, Lady Kriemhild, / my word amiss to take,\nFor not without good reason here / such thing I spake.\nBoth heard I say together, / when them I first did see,\nWhen that erstwhile the monarch / did work his royal will o’er me,",
        "821",
        "And when in knightly fashion / my love for him he won,\nThen himself said Siegfried / he were the monarch’s man.\nFor liegeman thus I hold him, / since he the same did say.\"\nThen spake fair Lady Kriemhild: / “With me ’twere dealt in sorry way.",
        "822",
        "“And these my noble brothers, / how could they such thing see,\nThat I of their own liegeman / e’er the wife should be?\nThus will I beg thee, Brunhild, / as friend to friend doth owe,\nThat thou, as well befits thee, / shalt further here such words forego.”",
        "823",
        "“No whit will I give over,\" / spake the monarch’s spouse.\n“Wherefore should I so many / a knight full valiant lose,\nWho to us in service / is bounden with thy man?\"\nKriemhild the fair lady / thereat sore to rage began.",
        "824",
        "“In sooth must thou forego it / that he should e’er to thee\nAught of service offer. / More worthy e’en is he\nThan is my brother Gunther, / who is a royal lord.\nSo shalt thou please to spare me / what I now from thee have heard.",
        "825",
        "“And to me is ever wonder, / since he thy liegeman is,\nAnd thou dost wield such power / over us twain as this,\nThat he so long his tribute / to thee hath failed to pay.\n’Twere well thy haughty humor / thou should’st no longer here display.”",
        "826",
        "“Too lofty now thou soarest,\" / the queen did make reply.\n“Now will I see full gladly / if in such honor high\nThis folk doth hold thy person / as mine own it doth.\"\nOf mood full sorely wrathful / were the royal ladies both.",
        "827",
        "Then spake the Lady Kriemhild: / “That straightway shall be seen.\nSince that thou my husband / dost thy liegeman ween,\nTo-day shall all the followers / of both the monarchs know,\nIf I ’fore wife of monarch / dare unto the minster go.",
        "828",
        "“That I free-born and noble / shalt thou this day behold,\nAnd that my royal husband, / as now to thee I’ve told,\n’Fore thine doth stand in honor, / by me shall well be shown.\nEre night shalt thou behold it, / how wife of him thou call’st thine own",
        "829",
        "To court shall lead good warriors / in the land of Burgundy.\nAnd ne’er a queen so lofty / as I myself shall be\nWas seen by e’er a mortal, / or yet a crown did wear.\"\nThen mickle was the anger / that rose betwixt the ladies there.",
        "830",
        "Then again spake Brunhild: / “Wilt thou not service own,\nSo must thou with thy women / hold thyself alone\nApart from all my following, / as we to minster go.\"\nThereto gave answer Kriemhild: / “In truth the same I fain will do.”",
        "831",
        "“Now dress ye fair, my maidens,\" / Kriemhild gave command.\n“Nor shall shame befall me / here within this land.\nAn have ye fair apparel, / let now be seen by you.\nWhat she here hath boasted / may Brunhild have full cause to rue.”",
        "832",
        "But little need to urge them: / soon were they richly clad\nIn garments wrought full deftly, / lady and many a maid.\nThen went with her attendants / the spouse of the monarch high;\nAnd eke appeared fair Kriemhild, / her body decked full gorgeously,",
        "833",
        "With three and forty maidens, / whom to the Rhine led she,\nAll clad in shining garments / wrought in Araby.\nSo came unto the minster / the maidens fair and tall.\nBefore the hall did tarry / for them the men of Siegfried all.",
        "834",
        "The people there did wonder / how the thing might be,\nThat no more together / the queens they thus did see,\nAnd that beside each other / they went not as before.\nThereby came thanes a many / anon to harm and trouble sore.",
        "835",
        "Here before the minster / the wife of Gunther stood.\nAnd good knights full many / were there of merry mood\nWith the fair ladies / that their eyes did see.\nThen came the Lady Kriemhild / with a full stately company.",
        "836",
        "Whate’er of costly raiment / decked lofty maids before,\n’Twas like a windy nothing / ’gainst what her ladies wore.\nThe wives of thirty monarchs / –such riches were her own–\nMight ne’er display together / what there by Lady Kriemhild shown.",
        "837",
        "Should any wish to do so / he could not say, I ween,\nThat so rich apparel / e’er before was seen\nAs there by her maidens / debonair was worn:\nBut that it grieved Brunhild / had Kriemhild that to do forborne.",
        "838",
        "There they met together / before the minster high.\nSoon the royal matron, / through mickle jealousy,\nKriemhild to pass no further, / did bid in rage full sore:\n“She that doth owe her homage / shall ne’er go monarch’s wife before.”",
        "839",
        "Then spake the Lady Kriemhild / –angry was her mood:\n“An could’st thou but be silent / that for thee were good.\nThyself hast brought dishonor / upon thy fair body:\nHow might, forsooth, a harlot / ever wife of monarch be?”",
        "840",
        "“Whom mak’st thou now a harlot?\" / the king’s wife answered her.\n“That do I thee,” spake Kriemhild, / “for that thy body fair\nFirst was clasped by Siegfried, / knight full dear to me.\nIn sooth ’twas ne’er my brother / won first thy maidenhead from thee.",
        "841",
        "“How did thy senses leave thee? / Cunning rare was this.\nHow let his love deceive thee, / since he thy liegeman is?\nAnd all in vain,” quoth Kriemhild, / “the plaint I hear thee bring.\"\n“In sooth,” then answered Brunhild, / “I’ll tell it to my spouse the\n      king.”",
        "842",
        "“What reck I of such evil? / Thy pride hath thee betrayed,\nThat thou deem’st my homage / should e’er to thee be paid.\nKnow thou in truth full certain / the thing may never be:\nNor shall I e’er be ready / to look for faithful friend in thee.”",
        "843",
        "Thereat did weep Queen Brunhild: / Kriemhild waited no more,\nBut passed into the minster / the monarch’s wife before,\nWith train of fair attendants. / Arose there mickle hate,\nWhereby eyes brightly shining / anon did grow all dim and wet.",
        "844",
        "However God they worshipped / or there the mass was sung,\nDid deem the Lady Brunhild / the waiting all too long,\nFor that her heart was saddened / and angry eke her mood.\nTherefore anon must suffer / many a hero keen and good.",
        "845",
        "Brunhild with her ladies / ’fore the minster did appear.\nThought she: “Now must Kriemhild / further give me to hear\nOf what so loud upbraideth / me this free-tongued wife.\nAnd if he thus hath boasted, / amend shall Siegfried make with life.”",
        "846",
        "Now came the noble Kriemhild / followed by warrior band.\nThen spake the Lady Brunhild: / “Still thou here shalt stand.\nThou giv’st me out for harlot: / let now the same be seen.\nKnow thou, what thus thou sayest / to me hath mickle sorrow been.”",
        "847",
        "Then spake the Lady Kriemhild: / “So may’st thou let me go.\nWith the ring upon my finger / I the same can show:\nThat brought to me my lover / when first by thee he lay.\"\nNe’er did Lady Brunhild / know grief as on this evil day.",
        "848",
        "Quoth she: “This ring full precious / some hand from me did steal,\nAnd from me thus a season / in evil way conceal:\nFull sure will I discover / who this same thief hath been.\"\nThen were the royal ladies / both in mood full angry seen.",
        "849",
        "Then gave answer Kriemhild: / “I deem the thief not I.\nWell hadst thou been silent, / hold’st thou thine honor high.\nI’ll show it with this girdle / that I around me wear,\nThat in this thing I err not: / Siegfried hath lain by thee full near.”",
        "850",
        "Wrought of silk of Nineveh / a girdle there she wore,\nThat of stones full precious / showed a goodly store.\nWhen saw it Lady Brunhild / straight to weep gan she:\nSoon must Gunther know it / and all the men of Burgundy.",
        "851",
        "Then spake the royal matron: / “Bid hither come to me\nOf Rhine the lofty monarch. / Hear straightway shall he\nHow that his sister / doth my honor stain.\nHere doth she boast full open / that I in Siegfried’s arms have lain.”",
        "852",
        "The king came with his warriors, / where he did weeping find\nHis royal spouse Brunhild, / then spake in manner kind:\n“Now tell me, my dear lady, / who hath done aught to thee?\"\nShe spake unto the monarch: / “Thy wife unhappy must thou see.",
        "853",
        "“Me, thy royal consort, / would thy sister fain\nRob of all mine honor. / To thee must I complain:\nShe boasts her husband Siegfried / hath known thy royal bed.\"\nThen spake the monarch Gunther: / “An evil thing she then hath said.”",
        "854",
        "“I did lose a girdle: / here by her ’tis worn,\nAnd my ring all golden. / That I e’er was born,\nDo I rue full sorely / if thou wardest not from me\nThis full great dishonor: / that will I full repay to thee.”",
        "855",
        "Then spake the monarch Gunther: / “Now shall he come near,\nAnd hath he such thing boasted, / so shall he let us hear:\nEke must full deny it / the knight of Netherland.\"\nThen straight the spouse of Kriemhild / hither to bring he gave command.",
        "856",
        "When that angry-minded / Siegfried them did see,\nNor knew thereof the reason, / straightway then spake he:\n“Why do weep these ladies? / I’d gladly know that thing,\nOr wherefore to this presence / I am bidden by the king.”",
        "857",
        "Then spake the royal Gunther: / “Sore grieveth me this thing:\nTo me my Lady Brunhild / doth the story bring,\nHow that thereof thou boastest / that her fair body lay\nFirst in thy embraces: / this doth thy Lady Kriemhild say.”",
        "858",
        "Thereto gave answer Siegfried: / “An if she thus hath said,\nFull well shall she repent it / ere doth rest my head:\nBefore all thy good warriors / of that I’ll make me free,\nAnd swear by my high honor / such thing hath ne’er been told by me.”",
        "859",
        "Then spake of Rhine the monarch: / “That shalt thou let us see.\nThe oath that thou dost offer, / if such performed be,\nOf all false accusation / shalt thou delivered stand.\"\nIn ring to take their station / did he the high-born thanes command.",
        "860",
        "The full valiant Siegfried / in oath the hand did give.\nThen spake the lordly monarch: / “Well now do I perceive\nHow thou art all blameless, / of all I speak thee free;\nWhat here maintains my sister, / the same hath ne’er been done by thee.”",
        "861",
        "Thereto gave answer Siegfried: / “If gain should e’er accrue\nUnto my spouse, that Brunhild / from her had cause to rue,\nKnow that to me full sorely / ’twould endless sorrow be.\"\nThen looked upon each other / the monarchs twain right graciously.",
        "862",
        "“So should we govern women,\" / spake the thane Siegfried,\n“That to leave wanton babble / they should take good heed.\nForbid it to thy wife now, / to mine I’ll do the same.\nSuch ill-becoming manner /in sooth doth fill my heart with shame.”",
        "863",
        "No more said many a lady / fair, but thus did part.\nThen did the Lady Brunhild / grieve so sore at heart,\nThat it must move to pity / all King Gunther’s men.\nTo go unto his mistress / Hagen of Tronje saw ye then.",
        "864",
        "He asked to know her worry, / as he her weeping saw.\nThen told she him the story. / To her straight made he vow,\nThat Lady Kriemhild’s husband / must for the thing atone,\nElse henceforth should never / a joyous day by him be known.",
        "865",
        "Then came Ortwein and Gernot / where they together spake,\nAnd there the knights did counsel / Siegfried’s life to take.\nThither came eke Giselher, / son of Ute high.\nWhen heard he what they counselled, / spake he free from treachery:",
        "866",
        "“Ye good knights and noble, / wherefore do ye that?\nNe’er deserved hath Siegfried / in such way your hate,\nThat he therefor should forfeit / at your hands his life.\nIn sooth small matter is it / that maketh cause for woman’s strife.”",
        "867",
        "“Shall we rear race of bastards?\" / Hagen spake again:\n“Therefrom but little honor / had many a noble thane.\nThe thing that he hath boasted / upon my mistress high,\nTherefor my life I forfeit, / or he for that same thing shall die.”",
        "868",
        "Then spake himself the monarch: / “To us he ne’er did give\nAught but good and honor: / let him therefore live.\nWhat boots it if my anger / I vent the knight upon?\nGood faith he e’er hath shown us, / and that full willingly hath done.”",
        "869",
        "Then outspake of Metz / Ortwein the thane:\n“In sooth his arm full doughty / may bring him little gain.\nMy vengeance full he’ll suffer, / if but my lord allow.\"\nThe knights–nor reason had they– / against him mortal hate did vow.",
        "870",
        "None yet his words did follow, / but to the monarch’s ear\nNe’er a day failed Hagen / the thought to whisper there:\nIf that lived not Siegfried, / to him would subject be\nRoyal lands full many. / The king did sorrow bitterly.",
        "871",
        "Then did they nothing further: / soon began the play.\nAs from the lofty minster / passed they on their way,\nWhat doughty shafts they shattered / Siegfried’s spouse before!\nGunther’s men full many / saw ye there in rage full sore.",
        "872",
        "Spake the king: “Now leave ye / such mortal enmity:\nThe knight is born our honor / and fortune good to be.\nKeen is he unto wonder, / hath eke so doughty arm\nThat, were the contest open, / none is who dared to work him harm.”",
        "873",
        "“Naught shall he know,” quoth Hagen. / “At peace ye well may be:\nI trow the thing to manage / so full secretly\nThat Queen Brunhild’s weeping / he shall rue full sore.\nIn sooth shall he from Hagen / have naught but hate for evermore.”",
        "874",
        "Then spake the monarch Gunther: / “How might such thing e’er be?\"\nThereto gave answer Hagen: / “That shalt thou hear from me.\nWe’ll bid that hither heralds / unto our land shall fare,\nHere unknown to any, / who shall hostile tidings bear.",
        "875",
        "“Then say thou ’fore the strangers / that thou with all thy men\nWilt forth to meet the enemy. / He’ll offer service then\nIf that thus thou sayest, / and lose thereby his life,\nCan I but learn the story / from the valiant warrior’s wife.”",
        "876",
        "The king in evil manner / did follow Hagen’s rede,\nAnd the two knights, ere any / man thereof had heed,\nHad treachery together / to devise begun.\nFrom quarrel of two women / died heroes soon full many a one.",
