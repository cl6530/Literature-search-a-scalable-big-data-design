        "For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night,\nand the fat Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear\nto ear with an oily, tremulous smile.  He escorted them to their box\nwith a sort of pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands, and\ntalking at the top of his voice.  Dorian Gray loathed him more than\never.  He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met\nby Caliban.  Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him.  At\nleast he declared he did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand,\nand assured him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a\nreal genius and gone bankrupt over Shakespeare.  Hallward amused\nhimself with watching the faces in the pit.  The heat was terribly\noppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with\npetals of fire.  The youths in the gallery had taken off their coats\nand waistcoats and hung them over the side.  They talked to each\nother across the theatre, and shared their oranges with the tawdry\npainted girls who sat by them.  Some women were laughing in the pit;\ntheir voices were horribly shrill and discordant.  The sound of the\npopping of corks came from the bar.",
        "“What a place to find one’s divinity in!” said Lord Henry.",
        "“Yes!” answered Dorian Gray.  “It was here I found her, and she is\ndivine beyond all living things.  When she acts you will forget\neverything.  These common people here, with their coarse faces and\nbrutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage.\nThey sit silently and watch her.  They weep and laugh as she wills\nthem to do.  She makes them as responsive as a violin.  She\nspiritualizes them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh and\nblood as one’s self.”",
        "“Oh, I hope not!” murmured Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants\nof the gallery through his opera-glass.",
        "“Don’t pay any attention to him, Dorian,” said Hallward.  “I\nunderstand what you mean, and I believe in this girl.  Any one you\nlove must be marvellous, and any girl that has the effect you\ndescribe must be fine and noble.  To spiritualize one’s age,–that is\nsomething worth doing.  If this girl can give a soul to those who\nhave lived without one, if she can create the sense of beauty in\npeople whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them\nof their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not\ntheir own, she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the\nadoration of the world.  This marriage is quite right.  I did not\nthink so at first, but I admit it now.  God made Sibyl Vane for you.\nWithout her you would have been incomplete.”",
        "“Thanks, Basil,” answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand.  “I [37]\nknew that you would understand me.  Harry is so cynical, he terrifies\nme.  But here is the orchestra.  It is quite dreadful, but it only\nlasts for about five minutes.  Then the curtain rises, and you will\nsee the girl to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have\ngiven everything that is good in me.”",
        "A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of\napplause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage.  Yes, she was certainly\nlovely to look at,–one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry\nthought, that he had ever seen.  There was something of the fawn in\nher shy grace and startled eyes.  A faint blush, like the shadow of a\nrose in a mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the\ncrowded, enthusiastic house.  She stepped back a few paces, and her\nlips seemed to tremble.  Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began\nto applaud.  Dorian Gray sat motionless, gazing on her, like a man in\na dream.  Lord Henry peered through his opera-glass, murmuring,\n“Charming! charming!”",
        "The scene was the hall of Capulet’s house, and Romeo in his pilgrim’s\ndress had entered with Mercutio and his friends.  The band, such as\nit was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began.  Through\nthe crowd of ungainly, shabbily-dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like\na creature from a finer world.  Her body swayed, as she danced, as a\nplant sways in the water.  The curves of her throat were like the\ncurves of a white lily.  Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.",
        "Yet she was curiously listless.  She showed no sign of joy when her\neyes rested on Romeo.  The few lines she had to speak,–",
        "with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly\nartificial manner.  The voice was exquisite, but from the point of\nview of tone it was absolutely false.  It was wrong in color.  It\ntook away all the life from the verse.  It made the passion unreal.",
        "Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her.  Neither of his friends\ndared to say anything to him.  She seemed to them to be absolutely\nincompetent.  They were horribly disappointed.",
        "Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene\nof the second act.  They waited for that.  If she failed there, there\nwas nothing in her.",
        "She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight.  That could not\nbe denied.  But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew\nworse as she went on.  Her gestures became absurdly artificial.  She\nover-emphasized everything that she had to say.  The beautiful\npassage,–",
        "[38] was declaimed with the painful precision of a school-girl who\nhas been taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution.\nWhen she leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines,–",
        "she spoke the words as if they conveyed no meaning to her.  It was\nnot nervousness.  Indeed, so far from being nervous, she seemed\nabsolutely self-contained.  It was simply bad art.  She was a\ncomplete failure.",
        "Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their\ninterest in the play.  They got restless, and began to talk loudly\nand to whistle.  The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the\ndress-circle, stamped and swore with rage.  The only person unmoved\nwas the girl herself.",
        "When the second act was over there came a storm of hisses, and Lord\nHenry got up from his chair and put on his coat.  “She is quite\nbeautiful, Dorian,” he said, “but she can’t act.  Let us go.”",
        "“I am going to see the play through,” answered the lad, in a hard,\nbitter voice.  “I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an\nevening, Harry.  I apologize to both of you.”",
        "“My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,” interrupted\nHallward.  “We will come some other night.”",
        "“I wish she was ill,” he rejoined.  “But she seems to me to be simply\ncallous and cold.  She has entirely altered.  Last night she was a\ngreat artist.  To-night she is merely a commonplace, mediocre\nactress.”",
        "“Don’t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian.  Love is a more\nwonderful thing than art.”",
        "“They are both simply forms of imitation,” murmured Lord Henry.  “But\ndo let us go.  Dorian, you must not stay here any longer.  It is not\ngood for one’s morals to see bad acting.  Besides, I don’t suppose\nyou will want your wife to act.  So what does it matter if she plays\nJuliet like a wooden doll?  She is very lovely, and if she knows as\nlittle about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful\nexperience.  There are only two kinds of people who are really\nfascinating,–people who know absolutely everything, and people who\nknow absolutely nothing.  Good heavens, my dear boy, don’t look so\ntragic!  The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion\nthat is unbecoming.  Come to the club with Basil and myself.  We will\nsmoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane.  She is\nbeautiful.  What more can you want?”",
        "“Please go away, Harry,” cried the lad.  “I really want to be alone.-\n-Basil, you don’t mind my asking you to go?  Ah! can’t you see that\nmy heart is breaking?”  The hot tears came to his eyes.  His [39]\nlips trembled, and, rushing to the back of the box, he leaned up\nagainst the wall, hiding his face in his hands.",
        "“Let us go, Basil,” said Lord Henry, with a strange tenderness in his\nvoice; and the two young men passed out together.",
        "A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up, and the curtain\nrose on the third act.  Dorian Gray went back to his seat.  He looked\npale, and proud, and indifferent.  The play dragged on, and seemed\ninterminable.  Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy\nboots, and laughing.  The whole thing was a fiasco.  The last act was\nplayed to almost empty benches.",
        "As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the\ngreenroom.  The girl was standing alone there, with a look of triumph\non her face.  Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire.  There was a\nradiance about her.  Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of\ntheir own.",
        "When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy\ncame over her.  “How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!” she cried.",
        "“Horribly!” he answered, gazing at her in amazement,–\"horribly!  It\nwas dreadful.  Are you ill?  You have no idea what it was.  You have\nno idea what I suffered.”",
        "The girl smiled.  “Dorian,” she answered, lingering over his name\nwith long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than\nhoney to the red petals of her lips,–\"Dorian, you should have\nunderstood.  But you understand now, don’t you?”",
        "“Understand what?” he asked, angrily.",
        "“Why I was so bad to-night.  Why I shall always be bad.  Why I shall\nnever act well again.”",
        "He shrugged his shoulders.  “You are ill, I suppose.  When you are\nill you shouldn’t act.  You make yourself ridiculous.  My friends\nwere bored.  I was bored.”",
        "She seemed not to listen to him.  She was transfigured with joy.  An\necstasy of happiness dominated her.",
        "“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was the one\nreality of my life.  It was only in the theatre that I lived.  I\nthought that it was all true.  I was Rosalind one night, and Portia\nthe other.  The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of\nCordelia were mine also.  I believed in everything.  The common\npeople who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike.  The painted\nscenes were my world.  I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them\nreal.  You came,–oh, my beautiful love!–and you freed my soul from\nprison.  You taught me what reality really is.  To-night, for the\nfirst time in my life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the\nsilliness, of the empty pageant in which I had always played.  To-\nnight, for the first time, I became conscious that the Romeo was\nhideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the orchard was\nfalse, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to speak\nwere unreal, were not my words, not what I wanted to say.  You had\nbrought me something higher, something of which all art is but a\nreflection.  You have made me understand what love really is.  My\nlove! my love!  I am sick [40] of shadows.  You are more to me than\nall art can ever be.  What have I to do with the puppets of a play?\nWhen I came on to-night, I could not understand how it was that\neverything had gone from me.  Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it\nall meant.  The knowledge was exquisite to me.  I heard them hissing,\nand I smiled.  What should they know of love?  Take me away, Dorian–\ntake me away with you, where we can be quite alone.  I hate the\nstage.  I might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot\nmimic one that burns me like fire.  Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you\nunderstand now what it all means?  Even if I could do it, it would be\nprofanation for me to play at being in love.  You have made me see\nthat.”",
        "He flung himself down on the sofa, and turned away his face.  “You\nhave killed my love,” he muttered.",
        "She looked at him in wonder, and laughed.  He made no answer.  She\ncame across to him, and stroked his hair with her little fingers.\nShe knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips.  He drew them away,\nand a shudder ran through him.",
        "Then he leaped up, and went to the door.  “Yes,” he cried, “you have\nkilled my love.  You used to stir my imagination.  Now you don’t even\nstir my curiosity.  You simply produce no effect.  I loved you\nbecause you were wonderful, because you had genius and intellect,\nbecause you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and\nsubstance to the shadows of art.  You have thrown it all away.  You\nare shallow and stupid.  My God! how mad I was to love you!  What a\nfool I have been!  You are nothing to me now.  I will never see you\nagain.  I will never think of you.  I will never mention your name.\nYou don’t know what you were to me, once.  Why, once . . . . Oh, I\ncan’t bear to think of it!  I wish I had never laid eyes upon you!\nYou have spoiled the romance of my life.  How little you can know of\nlove, if you say it mars your art!  What are you without your art?\nNothing.  I would have made you famous, splendid, magnificent.  The\nworld would have worshipped you, and you would have belonged to me.\nWhat are you now?  A third-rate actress with a pretty face.”",
        "The girl grew white, and trembled.  She clinched her hands together,\nand her voice seemed to catch in her throat.  “You are not serious,\nDorian?” she murmured.  “You are acting.”",
        "“Acting!  I leave that to you.  You do it so well,” he answered,\nbitterly.",
        "She rose from her knees, and, with a piteous expression of pain in\nher face, came across the room to him.  She put her hand upon his\narm, and looked into his eyes.  He thrust her back.  “Don’t touch\nme!” he cried.",
        "A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet, and lay\nthere like a trampled flower.  “Dorian, Dorian, don’t leave me!” she\nwhispered.  “I am so sorry I didn’t act well.  I was thinking of you\nall the time.  But I will try,–indeed, I will try.  It came so\nsuddenly across me, my love for you.  I think I should never have\nknown it if you had not kissed me,–if we had not kissed each other.\nKiss me again, my love.  Don’t go away from me.  I couldn’t bear it.\nCan’t you forgive me for to-night?  I will work so hard, and try to\n[41] improve.  Don’t be cruel to me because I love you better than\nanything in the world.  After all, it is only once that I have not\npleased you.  But you are quite right, Dorian.  I should have shown\nmyself more of an artist.  It was foolish of me; and yet I couldn’t\nhelp it.  Oh, don’t leave me, don’t leave me.”  A fit of passionate\nsobbing choked her.  She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing,\nand Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his\nchiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain.  There is always\nsomething ridiculous about the passions of people whom one has ceased\nto love.  Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic.  Her\ntears and sobs annoyed him.",
        "“I am going,” he said at last, in his calm, clear voice.  “I don’t\nwish to be unkind, but I can’t see you again.  You have disappointed\nme.”",
        "She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer to him.  Her\nlittle hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for\nhim.  He turned on his heel, and left the room.  In a few moments he\nwas out of the theatre.",
        "Where he went to, he hardly knew.  He remembered wandering through\ndimly-lit streets with gaunt black-shadowed archways and evil-looking\nhouses.  Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after\nhim.  Drunkards had reeled by cursing, and chattering to themselves\nlike monstrous apes.  He had seen grotesque children huddled upon\ndoor-steps, and had heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.",
        "When the dawn was just breaking he found himself at Covent Garden.\nHuge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the\npolished empty street.  The air was heavy with the perfume of the\nflowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his\npain.  He followed into the market, and watched the men unloading\ntheir wagons.  A white-smocked carter offered him some cherries.  He\nthanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money for them,\nand began to eat them listlessly.  They had been plucked at midnight,\nand the coldness of the moon had entered into them.  A long line of\nboys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses,\ndefiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge jade-\ngreen piles of vegetables.  Under the portico, with its gray sun-\nbleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,\nwaiting for the auction to be over.  After some time he hailed a\nhansom and drove home.  The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of\nthe houses glistened like silver against it.  As he was passing\nthrough the library towards the door of his bedroom, his eye fell\nupon the portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him.  He started back\nin surprise, and then went over to it and examined it.  In the dim\narrested light that struggled through the cream-colored silk blinds,\nthe face seemed to him to be a little changed.  The expression looked\ndifferent.  One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in\nthe mouth.  It was certainly curious.",
        "He turned round, and, walking to the window, drew the blinds up.  The\nbright dawn flooded the room, and swept the fantastic shadows [42]\ninto dusky corners, where they lay shuddering.  But the strange\nexpression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to\nlinger there, to be more intensified even.  The quivering, ardent\nsunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly\nas if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some\ndreadful thing.",
        "He winced, and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in\nivory Cupids, that Lord Henry had given him, he glanced hurriedly\ninto it.  No line like that warped his red lips.  What did it mean?",
        "He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it\nagain.  There were no signs of any change when he looked into the\nactual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression\nhad altered.  It was not a mere fancy of his own.  The thing was\nhorribly apparent.",
        "He threw himself into a chair, and began to think.  Suddenly there\nflashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward’s studio\nthe day the picture had been finished.  Yes, he remembered it\nperfectly.  He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain\nyoung, and the portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be\nuntarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his\npassions and his sins; that the painted image might be seared with\nthe lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep all the\ndelicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood.\nSurely his prayer had not been answered?  Such things were\nimpossible.  It seemed monstrous even to think of them.  And, yet,\nthere was the picture before him, with the touch of cruelty in the\nmouth.",
        "Cruelty!  Had he been cruel?  It was the girl’s fault, not his.  He\nhad dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her\nbecause he had thought her great.  Then she had disappointed him.\nShe had been shallow and unworthy.  And, yet, a feeling of infinite\nregret came over him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing\nlike a little child.  He remembered with what callousness he had\nwatched her.  Why had he been made like that?  Why had such a soul\nbeen given to him?  But he had suffered also.  During the three\nterrible hours that the play had lasted, he had lived centuries of\npain, aeon upon aeon of torture.  His life was well worth hers.  She\nhad marred him for a moment, if he had wounded her for an age.\nBesides, women were better suited to bear sorrow than men.  They\nlived on their emotions.  They only thought of their emotions.  When\nthey took lovers, it was merely to have some one with whom they could\nhave scenes.  Lord Henry had told him that, and Lord Henry knew what\nwomen were.  Why should he trouble about Sibyl Vane?  She was nothing\nto him now.",
        "But the picture?  What was he to say of that?  It held the secret of\nhis life, and told his story.  It had taught him to love his own\nbeauty.  Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?  Would he ever\nlook at it again?",
        "No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses.  The\nhorrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it.\nSuddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that\n[43] makes men mad.  The picture had not changed.  It was folly to\nthink so.",
        "Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel\nsmile.  Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight.  Its blue eyes\nmet his own.  A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the\npainted image of himself, came over him.  It had altered already, and\nwould alter more.  Its gold would wither into gray.  Its red and\nwhite roses would die.  For every sin that he committed, a stain\nwould fleck and wreck its fairness.  But he would not sin.  The\npicture, changed or unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of\nconscience.  He would resist temptation.  He would not see Lord Henry\nany more,–would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous\ntheories that in Basil Hallward’s garden had first stirred within him\nthe passion for impossible things.  He would go back to Sibyl Vane,\nmake her amends, marry her, try to love her again.  Yes, it was his\nduty to do so.  She must have suffered more than he had.  Poor child!\nHe had been selfish and cruel to her.  The fascination that she had\nexercised over him would return.  They would be happy together.  His\nlife with her would be beautiful and pure.",
        "He got up from his chair, and drew a large screen right in front of\nthe portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it.  “How horrible!” he\nmurmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened\nit.  When he stepped out on the grass, he drew a deep breath.  The\nfresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions.  He\nthought only of Sibyl Vane.  A faint echo of his love came back to\nhim.  He repeated her name over and over again.  The birds that were\nsinging in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers\nabout her.",
