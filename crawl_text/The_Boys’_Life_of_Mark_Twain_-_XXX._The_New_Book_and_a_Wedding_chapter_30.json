        "Clemens closed his lecture tour in March with a profit of something more\nthan eight thousand dollars.  He had intended to make a spring tour of\nCalifornia, but went to Elmira instead.  The revised proofs of his book\nwere coming now, and he and gentle Livy Langdon read them together.\nSamuel Clemens realized presently that the girl he had chosen had a\ndelicate literary judgment.  She became all at once his editor, a\nposition she held until her death.  Her refining influence had much to do\nwith Mark Twain’s success, then and later, and the world owes her a debt\nof gratitude.  Through that first pleasant summer these two worked at the\nproofs and planned for their future, and were very happy indeed.",
        "It was about the end of July when the big book appeared at last, and its\nsuccess was startling.  Nothing like it had ever been known before.  Mark\nTwain’s name seemed suddenly to be on every tongue–his book in\neverybody’s hands.  From one end of the country to the other, readers\nwere hailing him as the greatest humorist and descriptive writer of\nmodern times.  By the first of the year more than thirty thousand volumes\nhad been sold.  It was a book of travel; its lowest price was three and a\nhalf dollars; the record has not been equaled since.  In England also\nlarge editions had been issued, and translations into foreign languages\nwere under way.  It was and is a great book, because it is a human book–\na book written straight from the heart.",
        "If Mark Twain had not been famous before, he was so now.  Indeed, it is\ndoubtful if any other American author was so widely known and read as the\nauthor of “The Innocents Abroad” during that first half-year after its\npublication.",
        "Yet for some reason he still did not regard himself as a literary man.\nHe was a journalist, and began to look about for a paper which he could\nbuy-his idea being to establish a business and a home.  Through Mr.\nLangdon’s assistance, he finally obtained an interest in the “Buffalo\nExpress,” and the end of the year 1869 found him established as its\nassociate editor, though still lecturing here and there, because his\nwedding-day was near at hand and there must be no lack of funds.",
        "It was the 2d of February, 1870, that Samuel Clemens and Olivia Langdon\nwere married.  A few days before, he sat down one night and wrote to\nJim Gillis, away out in the Tuolumne Hills, and told him of all his good\nfortune, recalling their days at Angel’s Camp, and the absurd frog story,\nwhich he said had been the beginning of his happiness.  In the five years\nsince then he had traveled a long way, but he had not forgotten.",
        "On the morning of his wedding-day Mark Twain received from his publisher\na check for four thousand dollars, his profit from three months’ sales of\nthe book, a handsome sum.",
        "The wedding was mainly a family affair.  Twichell and his wife came over\nfrom Hartford–Twichell to assist Thomas K. Beecher in performing the\nceremony.  Jane Clemens could not come, nor Orion and his wife; but\nPamela, a widow now, and her daughter Annie, grown to a young lady,\narrived from St. Louis.  Not more than one hundred guests gathered in the\nstately Langdon parlors that in future would hold so much history for\nSamuel Clemens and Olivia Langdon–so much of the story of life and death\nthat thus made its beginning there.  Then, at seven in the evening, they\nwere married, and the bride danced with her father, and the Rev. Thomas\nBeecher declared she wore the longest gloves he had ever seen.",
        "It was the next afternoon that the wedding-party set out for Buffalo.\nThrough a Mr. Slee, an agent of Mr. Langdon’s, Clemens had engaged, as he\nsupposed, a boarding-house, quiet and unpretentious, for he meant to\nstart his married life modestly.  Jervis Langdon had a plan of his own\nfor his daughter, but Clemens had received no inkling of it, and had full\nfaith in the letter which Slee had written, saying that a choice and\ninexpensive boarding-house had been secured.  When, about nine o’clock\nthat night, the party reached Buffalo, they found Mr. Slee waiting at the\nstation.  There was snow, and sleighs had been ordered.  Soon after\nstarting, the sleigh of the bride and groom fell behind and drove about\nrather aimlessly, apparently going nowhere in particular.  This disturbed\nthe groom, who thought they should arrive first and receive their guests.\nHe criticized Slee for selecting a house that was so hard to find, and\nwhen they turned at last into Delaware Avenue, Buffalo’s finest street,\nand stopped before a handsome house, he was troubled concerning the\nrichness of the locality.",
        "They were on the steps when the door opened and a perfect fairyland of\nlights and decoration was revealed within.  The friends who had gone\nahead came out with greetings to lead in the bride and groom.  Servants\nhurried forward to take bags and wraps.  They were ushered inside; they\nwere led through beautiful rooms, all newly appointed and garnished.  The\nbridegroom was dazed, unable to understand the meaning of it all–the\ncompleteness of their possession.  At last his young wife put her hand\nupon his arm.",
        "“Don’t you understand, Youth?” she said–that was always her name for\nhim.  “Don’t you understand?  It is ours, all ours–everything–a gift\nfrom father.”",
        "But still he could not quite grasp it, and Mr. Langdon brought a little\nbox and, opening it, handed them the deeds.",
        "Nobody quite remembers what was the first remark that Samuel Clemens\nmade, but either then or a little later he said:",
        "“Mr. Langdon, whenever you are in Buffalo, if it’s twice a year, come\nright here.  Bring your bag and stay overnight if you want to.  It\nsha’n’t cost you a cent.”",
