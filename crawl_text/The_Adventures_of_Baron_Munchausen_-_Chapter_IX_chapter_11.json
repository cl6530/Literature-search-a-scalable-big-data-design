        "  Adventures in Turkey, and upon the river Nile–Sees a balloon\n  over Constantinople; shoots at, and brings it down; finds a French\n  experimental philosopher suspended from it–Goes on an embassy to\n  Grand Cairo, and returns upon the Nile, where he is thrown into an\n  unexpected situation, and detained six weeks.",
        "When I was in the service of the Turks I frequently amused myself in a\npleasure-barge on the Marmora, which commands a view of the whole city\nof Constantinople, including the Grand Seignior’s Seraglio. One\nmorning, as I was admiring the beauty and serenity of the sky, I\nobserved a globular substance in the air, which appeared to be about\nthe size of a twelve-inch globe, with somewhat suspended from it. I\nimmediately took up my largest and longest barrel fowling-piece, which\nI never travel or make even an excursion without, if I can help it; I\ncharged with a ball, and fired at the globe, but to no purpose, the\nobject being at too great a distance. I then put in a double quantity\nof powder, and five or six balls: this second attempt succeeded; all\nthe balls took effect, and tore one side open, and brought it down.\nJudge my surprise when a most elegant gilt car, with a man in it, and\npart of a sheep which seemed to have been roasted, fell within two\nyards of me. When my astonishment had in some degree subsided, I\nordered my people to row close to this strange aërial traveller.",
        "I took him on board my barge (he was a native of France): he was much\nindisposed from his sudden fall into the sea, and incapable of\nspeaking; after some time, however, he recovered, and gave the\nfollowing account of himself, viz.: “About seven or eight days since,\nI cannot tell which, for I have lost my reckoning, having been most of\nthe time where the sun never sets, I ascended from the Land’s End in\nCornwall, in the island of Great Britain, in the car from which I have\nbeen just taken, suspended from a very large balloon, and took a sheep\nwith me to try atmospheric experiments upon: unfortunately, the wind\nchanged within ten minutes after my ascent, and instead of driving\ntowards Exeter, where I intended to land, I was driven towards the\nsea, over which I suppose I have continued ever since, but much too\nhigh to make observations.",
        "“The calls of hunger were so pressing, that the intended experiments\nupon heat and respiration gave way to them. I was obliged, on the\nthird day, to kill the sheep for food; and being at that time\ninfinitely above the moon, and for upwards of sixteen hours after so\nvery near the sun that it scorched my eyebrows, I placed the carcase,\ntaking care to skin it first, in that part of the car where the sun\nhad sufficient power, or, in other words, where the balloon did not\nshade it from the sun, by which method it was well roasted in about\ntwo hours. This has been my food ever since.” Here he paused, and\nseemed lost in viewing the objects about him. When I told him the\nbuildings before us were the Grand Seignior’s Seraglio at\nConstantinople, he seemed exceedingly affected, as he had supposed\nhimself in a very different situation. “The cause,” added he, “of my\nlong flight, was owing to the failure of a string which was fixed to a\nvalve in the balloon, intended to let out the inflammable air; and if\nit had not been fired at, and rent in the manner before mentioned, I\nmight, like Mahomet, have been suspended between heaven and earth till\ndoomsday.”",
        "The Grand Seignior, to whom I was introduced by the Imperial, Russian,\nand French ambassadors, employed me to negotiate a matter of great\nimportance at Grand Cairo, and which was of such a nature that it must\never remain a secret.",
        "I went there in great state by land; where, having completed the\nbusiness, I dismissed almost all my attendants, and returned like a\nprivate gentleman; the weather was delightful, and that famous river\nthe Nile was beautiful beyond all description; in short, I was tempted\nto hire a barge to descend by water to Alexandria. On the third day of\nmy voyage the river began to rise most amazingly (you have all heard,\nI presume, of the annual overflowing of the Nile), and on the next day\nit spread the whole country for many leagues on each side! On the\nfifth, at sunrise, my barge became entangled with what I at first took\nfor shrubs, but as the light became stronger I found myself surrounded\nby almonds, which were perfectly ripe, and in the highest perfection.\nUpon plumbing with a line my people found we were at least sixty feet\nfrom the ground, and unable to advance or retreat. At about eight or\nnine o’clock, as near as I could judge by the altitude of the sun, the\nwind rose suddenly, and canted our barge on one side: here she filled,\nand I saw no more of her for some time. Fortunately we all saved\nourselves (six men and two boys) by clinging to the tree, the boughs\nof which were equal to our weight, though not to that of the barge: in\nthis situation we continued six weeks and three days, living upon the\nalmonds; I need not inform you we had plenty of water. On the forty-\nsecond day of our distress the water fell as rapidly as it had risen,\nand on the forty-sixth we were able to venture down upon terra\nfirma. Our barge was the first pleasing object we saw, about two\nhundred yards from the spot where she sunk. After drying everything\nthat was useful by the heat of the sun, and loading ourselves with\nnecessaries from the stores on board, we set out to recover our lost\nground, and found, by the nearest calculation, we had been carried\nover garden-walls, and a variety of enclosures, above one hundred and\nfifty miles. In four days, after a very tiresome journey on foot, with\nthin shoes, we reached the river, which was now confined to its banks,\nrelated our adventures to a boy, who kindly accommodated all our\nwants, and sent us forward in a barge of his own. In six days more we\narrived at Alexandria, where we took shipping for Constantinople. I\nwas received kindly by the Grand Seignior, and had the honour of\nseeing the Seraglio, to which his highness introduced me himself.",
