        "  The Baron is made a prisoner of war, and sold for a slave–Keeps\n  the Sultan’s bees, which are attacked by two bears–Loses one of\n  his bees; a silver hatchet, which he throws at the bears, rebounds\n  and flies up to the moon; brings it back by an ingenious\n  invention; falls to the earth on his return, and helps himself out\n  of a pit–Extricates himself from a carriage which meets his in a\n  narrow road, in a manner never before attempted nor practised\n  since–The wonderful effects of the frost upon his servant’s\n  French horn.",
        "I was not always successful. I had the misfortune to be overpowered by\nnumbers, to be made prisoner of war; and, what is worse, but always\nusual among the Turks, to be sold for a slave. [The Baron was\nafterwards in great favour with the Grand Seignior, as will appear\nhereafter.] In that state of humiliation my daily task was not very\nhard and laborious, but rather singular and irksome. It was to drive\nthe Sultan’s bees every morning to their pasture-grounds, to attend\nthem all the day long, and against night to drive them back to their\nhives. One evening I missed a bee, and soon observed that two bears\nhad fallen upon her to tear her to pieces for the honey she carried. I\nhad nothing like an offensive weapon in my hands but the silver\nhatchet, which is the badge of the Sultan’s gardeners and farmers. I\nthrew it at the robbers, with an intention to frighten them away, and\nset the poor bee at liberty; but, by an unlucky turn of my arm, it\nflew upwards, and continued rising till it reached the moon. How\nshould I recover it? how fetch it down again? I recollected that\nTurkey-beans grow very quick, and run up to an astonishing height. I\nplanted one immediately; it grew, and actually fastened itself to one\nof the moon’s horns. I had no more to do now but to climb up by it\ninto the moon, where I safely arrived, and had a troublesome piece of\nbusiness before I could find my silver hatchet, in a place where\neverything has the brightness of silver; at last, however, I found it\nin a heap of chaff and chopped straw. I was now for returning: but,\nalas! the heat of the sun had dried up my bean; it was totally useless\nfor my descent: so I fell to work, and twisted me a rope of that\nchopped straw, as long and as well as I could make it. This I fastened\nto one of the moon’s horns, and slid down to the end of it. Here I\nheld myself fast with the left hand, and with the hatchet in my right,\nI cut the long, now useless end of the upper part, which, when tied to\nthe lower end, brought me a good deal lower: this repeated splicing\nand tying of the rope did not improve its quality, or bring me down to\nthe Sultan’s farm. I was four or five miles from the earth at least\nwhen it broke; I fell to the ground with such amazing violence, that I\nfound myself stunned, and in a hole nine fathoms deep at least, made\nby the weight of my body falling from so great a height: I recovered,\nbut knew not how to get out again; however, I dug slopes or steps with\nmy finger-nails [the Baron’s nails were then of forty years’ growth],\nand easily accomplished it.",
        "Peace was soon after concluded with the Turks, and gaining my liberty,\nI left St. Petersburg at the time of that singular revolution, when\nthe emperor in his cradle, his mother, the Duke of Brunswick, her\nfather, Field-Marshal Munich, and many others were sent to Siberia.\nThe winter was then so uncommonly severe all over Europe, that ever\nsince the sun seems to be frost-bitten. At my return to this place, I\nfelt on the road greater inconveniences than those I had experienced\non my setting out.",
        "I travelled post, and finding myself in a narrow lane, bid the\npostillion give a signal with his horn, that other travellers might\nnot meet us in the narrow passage. He blew with all his might; but his\nendeavours were in vain, he could not make the horn sound, which was\nunaccountable, and rather unfortunate, for soon after we found\nourselves in the presence of another coach coming the other way: there\nwas no proceeding; however, I got out of my carriage, and being pretty\nstrong, placed it, wheels and all, upon my head: I then jumped over a\nhedge about nine feet high (which, considering the weight of the\ncoach, was rather difficult) into a field, and came out again by\nanother jump into the road beyond the other carriage: I then went back\nfor the horses, and placing one upon my head, and the other under my\nleft arm, by the same means brought them to my coach, put to, and\nproceeded to an inn at the end of our stage. I should have told you\nthat the horse under my arm was very spirited, and not above four\nyears old; in making my second spring over the hedge, he expressed\ngreat dislike to that violent kind of motion by kicking and snorting;\nhowever, I confined his hind legs by putting them into my coat-pocket.\nAfter we arrived at the inn my postillion and I refreshed ourselves:\nhe hung his horn on a peg near the kitchen fire; I sat on the other\nside.",
        "Suddenly we heard a tereng! tereng! teng! teng! We looked round, and\nnow found the reason why the postillion had not been able to sound his\nhorn; his tunes were frozen up in the horn, and came out now by\nthawing, plain enough, and much to the credit of the driver; so that\nthe honest fellow entertained us for some time with a variety of\ntunes, without putting his mouth to the horn–\"The King of Prussia’s\nMarch,” “Over the Hill and over the Dale,” with many other favourite\ntunes; at length the thawing entertainment concluded, as I shall this\nshort account of my Russian travels.",
        "Some travellers are apt to advance more than is perhaps strictly\ntrue; if any of the company entertain a doubt of my veracity, I shall\nonly say to such, I pity their want of faith, and must request they\nwill take leave before I begin the second part of my adventures, which\nare as strictly founded in fact as those I have already related.",
