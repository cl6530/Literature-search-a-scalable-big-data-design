        "  By a demoniacal art, a junior uncle and an elder brother’s wife\n      (Pao-yü and lady Feng) come across five devils.\n  The gem of Spiritual Perception meets, in a fit of torpor, the two\n      perfect men.",
        "Hsiao Hung, the story continues, was much unsettled in her mind. Her\nthoughts rolled on in one connected string. But suddenly she became\ndrowsy, and falling asleep, she encountered Chia Yün, who tried to carry\nout his intention to drag her near him. She twisted herself round, and\nendeavoured to run away; but was tripped over by the doorstep. This gave\nher such a start that she woke up. Then, at length, she realised that it\nwas only a dream. But so restlessly did she, in consequence of this\nfright, keep on rolling and tossing that she could not close her eyes\nduring the whole night. As soon as the light of the next day dawned, she\ngot up. Several waiting-maids came at once to tell her to go and sweep\nthe floor of the rooms, and to bring water to wash the face with. Hsiao\nHung did not even wait to arrange her hair or perform her ablutions;\nbut, turning towards the looking-glass, she pinned her chevelure up\nanyhow; and, rinsing her hands, and, tying a sash round her waist, she\nrepaired directly to sweep the apartments.",
        "Who would have thought it, Pao-yü also had set his heart upon her the\nmoment he caught sight of her the previous day. Yet he feared, in the\nfirst place, that if he mentioned her by name and called her over into\nhis service, Hsi Jen and the other girls might feel the pangs of\njealousy. He did not, either in the second place, have any idea what her\ndisposition was like. The consequence was that he felt downcast; so much\nso, that when he got up at an early hour, he did not even comb his hair\nor wash, but simply remained seated, and brooded in a state of\nabstraction. After a while, he lowered the window. Through the gauze\nframe, from which he could distinctly discern what was going on outside,\nhe espied several servant-girls, engaged in sweeping the court. All of\nthem were rouged and powdered; they had flowers inserted in their hair,\nand were grandly got up. But the only one, of whom he failed to get a\nglimpse, was the girl he had met the day before.",
        "Pao-yü speedily walked out of the door with slipshod shoes. Under the\npretence of admiring the flowers, he glanced, now towards the east; now\ntowards the west. But upon raising his head, he descried, in the\nsouthwest corner, some one or other leaning by the side of the railing\nunder the covered passage. A crab-apple tree, however, obstructed the\nview and he could not see distinctly who it was, so advancing a step\nfurther in, he stared with intent gaze. It was, in point of fact, the\nwaiting-maid of the day before, tarrying about plunged in a reverie. His\nwish was to go forward and meet her, but he did not, on the other hand,\nsee how he could very well do so. Just as he was cogitating within\nhimself, he, of a sudden, perceived Pi Hen come and ask him to go and\nwash his face. This reminder placed him under the necessity of betaking\nhimself into his room. But we will leave him there, without further\ndetails, so as to return to Hsiao Hung.",
        "She was communing with her own thoughts. But unawares perceiving Hsi Jen\r\r\nwave her hand and call her by name, she had to walk up to her.",
        "“Our watering-pot is spoilt,” Hsi Jen smiled and said, “so go to Miss\nLin’s over there and find one for us to use.”",
        "Hsiao Hung hastened on her way towards the Hsiao Hsiang Kuan.",
        "When she got as far as the Ts’ui Yen bridge, she saw, on raising her\nhead and looking round, the mounds and lofty places entirely shut in by\nscreens, and she bethought herself that labourers were that day to plant\ntrees in that particular locality.",
        "At a great distance off, a band of men were, in very deed, engaged in\ndigging up the soil, while Chia Yün was seated on a boulder on the hill,\nsuperintending the works. The time came for Hsiao Hung to pass by, but\nshe could not muster the courage to do so. Nevertheless she had no other\ncourse than to quietly proceed to the Hsiao Hsiang Kuan. Then getting\nthe watering-pot, she sped on her way back again. But being in low\nspirits, she retired alone into her room and lay herself down. One and\nall, however, simply maintained that she was out of sorts, so they did\nnot pay any heed to her.",
        "A day went by. On the morrow fell, in fact, the anniversary of the birth\nof Wang Tzu-t’eng’s spouse, and some one was despatched from his\nresidence to come and invite dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang. Madame\nWang found out however that dowager lady Chia would not avail herself of\nthe invitation, and neither would she go. So Mrs. Hsüeh went along with\nlady Feng, and the three sisters of the Chia family, and Pao-ch’ai and\nPao-yü, and only returned home late in the evening.",
        "Madame Wang was sitting in Mrs. Hsüeh’s apartments, whither she had just\ncrossed, when she perceived Chia Huan come back from school, and she\nbade him transcribe incantations out of the Chin Kang Canon and intonate\nthem. Chia Huan accordingly came and seated himself on the stove-couch,\noccupied by Madame Wang, and, directing a servant to light the candles,\nhe started copying in an ostentatious and dashing manner. Now he called\nTs’ai Hsia to pour a cup of tea for him. Now he asked Yu Ch’uan to take\nthe scissors and cut the snuff of the wick. “Chin Ch’uan!” he next\ncried, “you’re in the way of the rays of the lamp.”",
        "The servant-girls had all along entertained an antipathy for him, and\nnot one of them therefore worried her mind about what he said. Ts’ai\nHsia was the only one who still got on well with him, so pouring a cup\nof tea, she handed it to him. But she felt prompted to whisper to him:\n\"Keep quiet a bit! what’s the use of making people dislike you?”",
        "“I know myself how matters stand,” Chia Huan rejoined, as he cast a\nsteady glance at her; “so don’t you try and befool me! Now that you are\non intimate terms with Pao-yü, you don’t pay much heed to me. I’ve also\nseen through it myself.”",
        "Ts’ai Hsiao set her teeth together, and gave him a fillip on the head.\n\"You heartless fellow!” she cried. “You’re like the dog, that bit Lü\nT’ung-pin. You have no idea of what’s right and what’s wrong!”",
        "While these two nagged away, they noticed lady Feng and Madame Wang\ncross together over to them. Madame Wang at once assailed him with\nquestions. She asked him how many ladies had been present on that day,\nwhether the play had been good or bad, and what the banquet had been\nlike.",
        "But a brief interval over, Pao-yü too appeared on the scene. After\nsaluting Madame Wang, he also made a few remarks, with all decorum; and\nthen bidding a servant remove his frontlet, divest him of his long gown\nand pull off his boots, he rushed head foremost, into his mother’s lap.",
        "Madame Wang caressed and patted him. But while Pao-yü clung to his\nmother’s neck, he spoke to her of one thing and then another.",
        "“My child,” said Madame Wang, “you’ve again had too much to drink; your\nface is scalding hot, and if you still keep on rubbing and scraping it,\nwhy, you’ll by and bye stir up the fumes of wine! Don’t you yet go and\nlie down quietly over there for a little!”",
        "Chiding him the while, she directed a servant to fetch a pillow. Pao-yü\ntherefore lay himself down at the back of Madame Wang, and called Ts’ai\nHsia to come and stroke him.",
        "Pao-yü then began to bandy words with Ts’ai Hsia. But perceiving that\nTs’ai Hsia was reserved, and, that instead of paying him any attention,\nshe kept her eyes fixed upon Chia Huan, Pao-yü eagerly took her hand.\n\"My dear girl!” he said; “do also heed me a little;” and as he gave\nutterance to this appeal, he kept her hand clasped in his.",
        "Ts’ai Hsia, however, drew her hand away and would not let him hold it.\n\"If you go on in this way,” she vehemently exclaimed, “I’ll shout out at\nonce.”",
        "These two were in the act of wrangling, when verily Chia Huan overheard\nwhat was going on. He had, in fact, all along hated Pao-yü; so when on\nthis occasion, he espied him up to his larks with Ts’ai Hsia, he could\nmuch less than ever stifle feelings of resentment in his heart. After\nsome reflection, therefore, an idea suggested itself to his mind, and\npretending that it was by a slip of the hand, he shoved the candle,\noverflowing with tallow, into Pao-yü’s face.",
        "“Ai ya!” Pao-yü was heard to exclaim. Every one in the whole room was\nplunged in consternation. With precipitate haste, the lanterns, standing\non the floor, were moved over; and, with the first ray of light, they\ndiscovered that Pao-yü’s face was one mass of tallow.",
        "Madame Wang gave way to anger as well as anxiety. At one time, she\nissued directions to the servants to rub and wash Pao-yü clean. At\nanother, she heaped abuse upon Chia Huan.",
        "Lady Feng jumped on to the stone-couch by leaps and bounds. But while\nintent upon removing the stuff from Pao-yü’s face, she simultaneously\nejaculated: “Master Tertius, are you still such a trickster! I’ll tell\nyou what, you’ll never turn to any good account! Yet dame Chao should\never correct and admonish him.”",
        "This single remark suggested the idea to Madame Wang, and she lost no\ntime in sending for Mrs. Chao to come round.",
        "“You bring up,” she berated her, “such a black-hearted offspring like\nthis, and don’t you, after all, advise and reprove him? Time and again I\npaid no notice whatever to what happened, and you and he have become\nmore audacious, and have gone from worse to worse!”",
        "Mrs. Chao had no alternative but to suppress every sense of injury,\nsilence all grumblings, and go herself and lend a hand to the others in\ntidying Pao-yü. She then perceived that a whole row of blisters had\nrisen on the left side of Pao-yü’s face, but that fortunately no injury\nhad been done to his eyes.",
        "When Madame Wang’s attention was drawn to them she felt her heart sore.\nIt fell a prey to fears also lest when dowager lady Chia made any\ninquiries about them she should find it difficult to give her any\nsatisfactory reply. And so distressed did she get that she gave Mrs.\nChao another scolding. But while she tried to comfort Pao-yü, she, at\nthe same time, fetched some powder for counteracting the effects of the\nvirus, and applied it on his face.",
        "“It’s rather sore,” said Pao-yü, “but it’s nothing to speak of. Tomorrow\nwhen my old grandmother asks about it, I can simply explain that I\nscalded it myself; that will be quite enough to tell her.”",
        "“If you say that you scalded it yourself,” lady Feng observed, “why,\nshe’ll also call people to task for not looking out; and a fit of rage\nwill, beyond doubt, be the outcome of it all.”",
        "Madame Wang then ordered the servants to take care and escort Pao-yü\nback to his room. On their arrival, Hsi Jen and his other attendants saw\nhim, and they were all in a great state of flurry.",
        "As for Lin Tai-yü, when she found that Pao-yü had gone out of doors, she\ncontinued the whole day a prey to ennui. In the evening, she deputed\nmessengers two and three times to go and inquire about him. But when she\ncame to know that he had been scalded, she hurried in person to come and\nsee him. She then discovered Pao-yü all alone, holding a glass and\nscanning his features in it; while the left side of his face was\nplastered all over with some medicine.",
        "Lin Tai-yü imagined that the burn was of an extremely serious nature,\nand she hastened to approach him with a view to examine it. Pao-yü,\nhowever, screened his face, and, waving his hand, bade her leave the\nroom; for knowing her usual knack for tidiness he did not feel inclined\nto let her get a glimpse of his face. Tai-yü then gave up the attempt,\nand confined herself to asking him: “whether it was very painful?”",
        "“It isn’t very sore,” replied Pao-yü, “if I look after it for a day or\ntwo, it will get all right.”",
        "But after another short stay, Lin Tai-yü repaired back to her quarters.",
        "The next day Pao-yü saw dowager lady Chia. But in spite of his\nconfession that he himself was responsible for the scalding of his face,\nhis grandmother could not refrain from reading another lecture to the\nservants who had been in attendance.",
        "A day after, Ma, a Taoist matron, whose name was recorded as Pao-yü’s\ngodmother, came on a visit to the mansion. Upon perceiving Pao-yü, she\nwas very much taken aback, and asked all about the circumstances of the\naccident. When he explained that he had been scalded, she forthwith\nshook her head and heaved a sigh; then while making with her fingers a\nfew passes over Pao-yü’s face, she went on to mutter incantations for\nseveral minutes. “I can guarantee that he’ll get all right,” she added,\n\"for this is simply a sadden and fleeting accident!”",
        "Turning towards dowager lady Chia: “Venerable ancestor,” she observed,\n\"Venerable Buddha! how could you ever be aware of the existence of the\nportentous passage in that Buddhistic classic, ’to the effect that a son\nof every person, who holds the dignity of prince, duke or high\nfunctionary, has no sooner come into the world and reached a certain age\nthan numerous evil spirits at once secretly haunt him, and pinch him,\nwhen they find an opportunity; or dig their nails into him; or knock his\nbowl of rice down, during, meal-time; or give him a shove and send him\nover, while he is quietly seated.’ So this is the reason why the\nmajority of the sons and grandsons of those distinguished families do\nnot grow up to attain manhood.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia, upon hearing her speak in this wise, eagerly asked:\n\"Is there any Buddhistic spell, by means of which to check their\ninfluence or not?”",
        "“This is an easy job!” rejoined the Taoist matron Ma, “all one need do\nis to perform several meritorious deeds on his account so as to\ncounteract the consequences of retribution and everything will then be\nput right. That canon further explains: ’that in the western part of the\nworld there is a mighty Buddha, whose glory illumines all things, and\nwhose special charge is to cast his lustre on the evil spirits in dark\nplaces; that if any benevolent man or virtuous woman offers him\noblations with sincerity of heart, he is able to so successfully\nperpetuate the peace and quiet of their sons and grandsons that these\nwill no more meet with any calamities arising from being possessed by\nmalevolent demons.’”",
        "“But what, I wonder,” inquired dowager lady Chia, “could be offered to\nthis god?”",
        "“Nothing of any great value,” answered the Taoist matron, Ma. “Exclusive\nof offerings of scented candles, several catties of scented oil can be\nadded, each day, to keep the lantern of the Great Sea alight. This\n’Great Sea’ lantern is the visible embodiment and Buddhistic\nrepresentation of this divinity, so day and night we don’t venture to\nlet it go out!”",
        "“For a whole day and a whole night,” asked dowager lady Chia, “how much\noil is needed, so that I too should accomplish a good action?”",
        "“There is really no limit as to quantity. It rests upon the goodwill of\nthe donor,” Ma, the Taoist matron, put in by way of reply. “In my\nquarters, for instance, I have several lanterns, the gifts of the\nconsorts of princes and the spouses of high officials living in various\nlocalities. The consort of the mansion of the Prince of Nan Au has been\nprompted in her beneficence by a liberal spirit; she allows each day\nforty-eight catties of oil, and a catty of wick; so that her ’Great Sea’\nlamp is only a trifle smaller than a water-jar. The spouse of the\nmarquis of Chin Hsiang comes next, with no more than twenty catties a\nday. Besides these, there are several other families; some giving ten\ncatties; some eight catties; some three; some five; subject to no fixed\nrule; and of course I feel bound to keep the lanterns alight on their\nbehalf.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia nodded her head and gave way to reflection.",
        "“There’s still another thing,” continued the Taoist matron, Ma. “If it\nbe on account of father or mother or seniors, any excessive donation\nwould not matter. But were you, venerable ancestor, to bestow too much\nin your offering for Pao-yü, our young master won’t, I fear, be equal to\nthe gift; and instead of being benefited, his happiness will be snapped.\nIf you therefore want to make a liberal gift seven catties will do; if a\nsmall one, then five catties will even be sufficient.”",
        "“Well, in that case,” responded dowager lady Chia, “let us fix upon five\ncatties a day, and every month come and receive payment of the whole\nlump sum!”",
        "“O-mi-to-fu!” exclaimed Ma, the Taoist matron, “Oh merciful, and mighty\nP’u Sa!”",
        "Dowager lady Chia then called the servants and impressed on their minds\nthat whenever Pao-yü went out of doors in the future, they should give\nseveral strings of cash to the pages to bestow on charity among the\nbonzes and Taoist priests, and the poor and needy they might meet on the\nway.",
        "These directions concluded, the Taoist matron trudged into the various\nquarters, and paid her respects, and then strolled leisurely about.\nPresently, she entered Mrs. Chao’s apartments. After the two ladies had\nexchanged salutations, Mrs. Chao bade a young servant-girl hand her\nguest a cup of tea. While Mrs. Chao busied herself pasting shoes, Ma,\nthe Taoist matron, espied, piled up in a heap on the stove-couch, sundry\npieces of silks and satins. “It just happens,” she consequently\nremarked, “that I have no facings for shoes, so my lady do give me a few\nodd cuttings of silk and satin, of no matter what colour, to make myself\na pair of shoes with.”",
        "Mrs. Chao heaved a sigh. “Look,” she said, “whether there be still among\nthem any pieces good for anything. But anything that’s worth anything\ndoesn’t find its way in here. If you don’t despise what’s worthless,\nyou’re at liberty to select any two pieces and to take them away, and\nhave done.”",
        "The Taoist matron, Ma, chose with alacrity several pieces and shoved\nthem in her breast.",
        "“The other day,” Mrs. Chao went on to inquire, “I sent a servant over\nwith five hundred cash; have you presented any offerings before the god\nof medicine or not?”",
        "“I’ve offered them long ago for you,” the Taoist matron Ma rejoined.",
        "“O-mi-to-fu!” ejaculated Mrs. Chao with a sigh, “were I a little better\noff, I’d also come often and offer gifts; but though my will be\nboundless, my means are insufficient!”",
        "“Don’t trouble your mind on this score,” suggested Ma, the Taoist\nmatron. “By and bye, when Mr. Huan has grown up into a man and obtained\nsome official post or other, will there be then any fear of your not\nbeing able to afford such offerings as you might like to make?”",
        "At these words Mrs. Chao gave a smile. “Enough, enough!” she cried.\n\"Don’t again refer to such contingencies! the present is a fair\ncriterion. For up to whom in this house can my son and I come? Pao-yü is\nstill a mere child; but he is such that he wins people’s love. Those big\npeople may be partial to him, and love him a good deal, I’ve nothing to\nsay to it; but I can’t eat humble pie to this sort of mistress!”",
        "While uttering this remark, she stretched out her two fingers.",
        "Ma, the Taoist matron, understood the meaning she desired to convey.\n\"It’s your lady Secunda, Lien, eh?” she forthwith asked.",
        "Mrs. Chao was filled with trepidation. Hastily waving her hand, she got\nto her feet, raised the portiere, and peeped outside. Perceiving that\nthere was no one about, she at length retraced her footsteps.\n\"Dreadful!” she then said to the Taoist matron. “Dreadful! But speaking\nof this sort of mistress, I’m not so much as a human being, if she\ndoesn’t manage to shift over into her mother’s home the whole of this\nfamily estate.”",
        "“Need you tell me this!” Ma, the Taoist matron, at these words, remarked\nwith a view to ascertain what she implied. “Haven’t I, forsooth,\ndiscovered it all for myself? Yet it’s fortunate that you don’t trouble\nyour minds about her; for it’s far better that you should let her have\nher own way.”",
        "“My dear woman,” rejoined Mrs. Chao, “Not let her have her own way! why,\nis it likely that any one would have the courage to tell her anything?”",
        "“I don’t mean to utter any words that may bring upon me retribution,\"\nadded Ma, the Taoist matron, “but you people haven’t got the wits. But\nit’s no matter of surprise. Yet if you daren’t openly do anything, why,\nyou could stealthily have devised some plan. And do you still tarry up\nto this day?”",
        "Mrs. Chao realised that there lurked something in her insinuation, and\nshe felt an inward secret joy. “What plan could I stealthily devise?\"\nshe asked. “I’ve got the will right enough, but I’m not a person gifted\nwith this sort of gumption. So were you to impart to me some way or\nother, I would reward you most liberally.”",
        "When the Taoist matron, Ma, heard this, she drew near to her.\n\"O-mi-to-fu! desist at once from asking me!” she designedly exclaimed.\n\"How can I know anything about such matters, contrary as they are to\nwhat is right?”",
        "“There you are again!” Mrs. Chao replied. “You’re one ever most ready to\nsuccour those in distress, and to help those in danger, and is it likely\nthat you’ll quietly look on, while some one comes and compasses my death\nas well as that of my son? Are you, pray, fearful lest I shouldn’t give\nyou any reward?”",
        "Ma, the Taoist matron, greeted this remark with a smile. “You’re right\nenough in what you say,” she ventured, “of my being unable to bear the\nsight of yourself and son receiving insult from a third party; but as\nfor your mention of rewards, why, what’s there of yours that I still\ncovet?”",
        "This answer slightly reassured Mrs. Chao’s mind. “How is it,” she\nspeedily urged, “that an intelligent person like you should have become\nso dense? If, indeed, the spell prove efficacious, and we exterminate\nthem both, is there any apprehension that this family estate won’t be\nours? and when that time comes, won’t you get all you may wish?”",
        "At this disclosure, Ma, the Taoist matron, lowered her head for a long\ntime. “When everything,” she observed, “shall have been settled\nsatisfactorily, and when there’ll be, what’s more, no proof at all, will\nyou still pay any heed to me?”",
        "“What’s there hard about this?” remarked Mrs. Chao. “I’ve saved several\ntaels from my own pin-money, and have besides a good number of clothes\nand head-ornaments. So you can first take several of these away with\nyou. And I’ll further write an I.O.U., and entrust it to you, and when\nthat time does come, I’ll pay you in full.”",
        "“That will do!” answered the Taoist matron, Ma.",
        "Mrs. Chao thereupon dismissed even a young servant-girl, who happened to\nbe in the room, and hastily opening a trunk, she produced several\narticles of clothing and jewelry, as well as a few odd pieces of silver\nfrom her own pocket-money. Then also writing a promissory note for fifty\ntaels, she surrendered the lot to Ma, the Taoist matron. “Take these,\"\nshe said, “in advance for presents in your temple.”",
        "At the sight of the various articles and of the promissory note, the\nTaoist matron became at once unmindful of what was right and what was\nwrong; and while her mouth was full of assent, she stretched out her\narm, and first and foremost laid hold of the hard cash, and next\nclutched the I.O.U. Turning then towards Mrs. Chao, she asked for a\nsheet of paper; and taking up a pair of scissors, she cut out two human\nbeings and gave them to Mrs. Chao, enjoining her to write on the upper\npart of them the respective ages of the two persons in question. Looking\nfurther for a sheet of blue paper, she cut out five blue-faced devils,\nwhich she bade her place together side by side with the paper men, and\ntaking a pin she made them fast. “When I get home,” she remarked, “I’ll\nhave recourse to some art, which will, beyond doubt, prove efficacious.”",
        "When she however had done speaking, she suddenly saw Madame Wang’s\nwaiting-maid make her appearance inside the room. “What! my dame, are\nyou in here!” the girl exclaimed. “Why, our lady is waiting for you!”",
        "The two dames then parted company.",
        "But passing them over, we will now allude to Lin Tai-yµ. As Pao-yü had\nscalded his face, and did not go out of doors very much, she often came\nto have a chat with him. On this particular day she took up, after her\nmeal, some book or other and read a couple of pages out of it. Next, she\nbusied herself a little with needlework, in company with Tzu Chuan. She\nfelt however thoroughly dejected and out of sorts. So she strolled out\nof doors along with her. But catching sight of the newly sprouted bamboo\nshoots, in front of the pavilion, they involuntarily stepped out of the\nentrance of the court, and penetrated into the garden. They cast their\neyes on all four quarters; but not a soul was visible. When they became\nconscious of the splendour of the flowers and the chatter of the birds,\nthey, with listless step, turned their course towards the I Hung court.\nThere they found several servant-girls baling out water; while a bevy of\nthem stood under the verandah, watching the thrushes having their bath.\nThey heard also the sound of laughter in the rooms.",
        "The fact is that Li Kung-ts’ai, lady Feng, and Pao-ch’ai were assembled\ninside. As soon as they saw them walk in, they with one voice shouted,\nsmiling: “Now, are not these two more!”",
        "“We are a full company to-day,” laughed Tai-yü, “but who has issued the\ncards and invited us here?”",
        "“The other day,” interposed lady Feng, “I sent servants with a present\nof two caddies of tea for you, Miss Lin; was it, after all, good?”",
        "“I had just forgotten all about it,” Tai-yü rejoined, “many thanks for\nyour kind attention!",
        "“I tasted it,” observed Pao-yü. “I did not think it anything good. But I\ndon’t know how others, who’ve had any of it, find it.”",
        "“Its flavour,” said Tai-yü, “is good; the only thing is, it has no\ncolour.”",
        "“It’s tribute tea from the Laos Kingdom,” continued lady Feng. “When I\ntried it, I didn’t either find it anything very fine. It’s not up to\nwhat we ordinarily drink.”",
        "“To my taste, it’s all right,” put in Tai-yü. “But what your palates are\nlike, I can’t make out.”",
        "“As you say it’s good,” suggested Pao-yü, “you’re quite at liberty to\ntake all I have for your use.”",
        "“I’ve got a great deal more of it over there,” lady Feng remarked.",
        "“I’ll tell a servant-girl to go and fetch it,” Tai-yü replied.",
        "“No need,” lady Feng went on. “I’ll send it over with some one. I also\nhave a favour to ask of you to-morrow, so I may as well tell the servant\nto bring it along at the same time.”",
        "When Lin Tai-yü heard these words, she put on a smile. “You just mark\nthis,” she observed. “I’ve had to-day a little tea from her place, and\nshe at once begins making a tool of me!”",
        "“Since you’ve had some of our tea,” lady Feng laughed, “how is it that\nyou have not yet become a wife in our household?”",
        "The whole party burst out laughing aloud. So much so, that they found it\ndifficult to repress themselves. But Tai-yü’s face was suffused with\nblushes. She turned her head the other way, and uttered not a word.",
        "“Our sister-in-law Secunda’s jibes are first-rate!” Pao-ch’ai chimed in\nwith a laugh.",
        "“What jibes!” exclaimed Tai-yü; “they’re purely and simply the prattle\nof a mean mouth and vile tongue! They’re enough to evoke people’s\ndispleasure!”",
        "Saying this, she went on to sputter in disgust.",
        "“Were you,” insinuated lady Feng, “to become a wife in my family, what\nis there that you would lack?” Pointing then at Pao-yü, “Look here!” she\ncried–\"Is not this human being worthy of you? Is not his station in\nlife good enough for you? Are not our stock and estate sufficient for\nyou? and in what slight degree can he make you lose caste?”",
        "Tai-yü rose to her feet, and retired immediately. But Pao-ch’ai shouted\nout: “Here’s P’in Erh in a huff! Don’t you yet come back? when you’ve\ngone, there will really be no fun!”",
        "While calling out to her, she jumped up to pull her back. As soon,\nhowever, as she reached the door of the room, she beheld Mrs. Chao,\naccompanied by Mrs. Chou; both coming to look up Pao-yü. Pao-yü and his\ncompanions got up in a body and pressed them into a seat. Lady Feng was\nthe sole person who did not heed them.",
        "But just as Pao-ch’ai was about to open her lips, she perceived a\nservant-girl, attached to Madame Wang’s apartments, appear on the scene.\n\"Your maternal uncle’s wife has come,” she said, “and she requests you,\nladies and young ladies, to come out and see her.”",
        "Li Kung-ts’ai hurriedly walked away in company with lady Feng. The two\ndames, Mrs. Chao and Mrs. Chou, in like manner took their leave and\nquitted the room.",
        "“As for me, I can’t go out,” Pao-yü shouted. “But whatever you do, pray,\ndon’t ask aunt to come in here.” “Cousin Lin,” he went on to say, “do\nstay on a while; I’ve got something to tell you.”",
        "Lady Feng overheard him. Turning her head towards Lin Tai-yü, “There’s\nsome one,” she cried; “who wants to speak to you.” And forthwith laying\nhold of Lin Tai-yü, she pushed her back and then trudged away, along\nwith Li Kung-ts’ai.",
        "During this time, Pao-yü clasped Tai-yü’s hand in his. He did nothing\nthan smile. But not a word did he utter. Tai-yü naturally, therefore,\ngot crimson in the face, and struggled to escape his importunities.",
        "“Ai-ya!” exclaimed Pao-yü. “How my head is sore!”",
        "“It should be!” rejoined Tai-yü. “O-mi-to-fu.”",
        "Pao-yü then gave vent to a loud shout. His body bounced three or four\nfeet high from the ground. His mouth was full of confused shrieks. But\nall he said was rambling talk.",
        "Tai-yü and the servant-girls were full of consternation, and, with all\npossible haste, they ran and apprised Madame Wang and dowager lady Chia.",
        "Wang Tzu-t’eng’s wife was, at this time, also with them, so they all\ncame in a body to see him. Pao-yü behaved more and more as if determined\nto clutch a sword or seize a spear to put an end to his existence. He\nraged in a manner sufficient to subvert the heavens and upset the earth.",
        "As soon as dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang caught sight of him, they\nwere struck with terror. They trembled wildly like a piece of clothing\nthat is being shaken. Uttering a shout of: “My son,” and another of: “My\nflesh,” they burst out into a loud fit of crying. Presently, all the\ninmates were seized with fright. Even Chia She, Madame Hsing, Chia\nCheng, Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Chia Jung, Chia Yün, Chia P’ing, Mrs.\nHsüeh, Hsüeh P’an, Chou Jui’s wife, and the various members of the\nhousehold, whether high or low, and the servant-girls and married women\ntoo, rushed into the garden to see what was up.",
        "The confusion that prevailed was, at the moment, like entangled flax.\nEvery one was at a loss what to do, when they espied lady Feng dash into\nthe garden, a glistening sword in hand, and try to cut down everything\nthat came in her way, ogle vacantly whomsoever struck her gaze, and make\nforthwith an attempt to despatch them. A greater panic than ever broke\nout among the whole assemblage. But placing herself at the head of a\nhandful of sturdy female servants, Chou Jui’s wife precipitated herself\nforward, and clasping her tight, they succeeded in snatching the sword\nfrom her grip, and carrying her back into her room.",
        "P’ing Erh, Feng Erh, and the other girls began to weep. They invoked the\nheavens and appealed to the earth. Even Chia Cheng was distressed at\nheart. One and all at this stage started shouting, some, one thing;\nsome, another. Some suggested exorcists. Some cried out for the\nposture-makers to attract the devils. Others recommended that Chang, the\nTaoist priest, of the Yü Huang temple, should catch the evil spirits. A\nthorough turmoil reigned supreme for a long time. The gods were\nimplored. Prayers were offered. Every kind of remedy was tried, but no\nbenefit whatever became visible.",
        "After sunset, the spouse of Wang Tzu-t’eng said good-bye and took her\ndeparture. On the ensuing day, Wang Tzu-t’eng himself also came to make\ninquiries. Following closely upon him, arrived, in a body, messengers\nfrom the young marquis Shih, Madame Hsing’s young brother, and their\nvarious relatives to ascertain for themselves how (lady Feng and Pao-yü)\nwere progressing. Some brought charm-water. Some recommended bonzes and\nTaoist priests. Others spoke highly of doctors. But that young fellow\nand his elder brother’s wife fell into such greater and greater stupor\nthat they lost all consciousness. Their bodies were hot like fire. As\nthey lay prostrate on their beds, they talked deliriously. With the fall\nof the shades of night their condition aggravated. So much so, that the\nmatrons and servant-girls did not venture to volunteer their attendance.\nThey had, therefore, to be both moved into Madame Wang’s quarters, where\nservants were told off to take their turn and watch them.",
        "Dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang, Madame Hsing and Mrs. Hsüeh did not\nbudge an inch or a step from their side. They sat round them, and did\nnothing but cry. Chia She and Chia Cheng too were a prey, at this\njuncture, to misgivings lest weeping should upset dowager lady Chia. Day\nand night oil was burnt and fires were, mindless of expense, kept\nalight. The bustle and confusion was such that no one, either master or\nservant, got any rest.",
        "Chia She also sped on every side in search of Buddhist and Taoist\npriests. But Chia Cheng had witnessed how little relief these things\ncould afford, and he felt constrained to dissuade Chia She from his\nendeavours. “The destiny,” he argued, “of our son and daughter is\nentirely dependent upon the will of Heaven, and no human strength can\nprevail. The malady of these two persons would not be healed, even were\nevery kind of treatment tried, and as I feel confident that it is the\ndesign of heaven that things should be as they are, all we can do is to\nallow it to carry out its purpose.”",
        "Chia She, however, paid no notice to his remonstrances and continued as\nhitherto to fuss in every imaginable way. In no time three days elapsed.\nLady Feng and Pao-yü were still confined to their beds. Their very\nbreaths had grown fainter. The whole household, therefore, unanimously\narrived at the conclusion that there was no hope, and with all despatch\nthey made every necessary preparation for the subsequent requirements of\nboth their relatives.",
        "Dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang, Chia Lien, P’ing Erh, Hsi Jen and the\nothers indulged in tears with keener and keener anguish. They hung\nbetween life and death. Mrs. Chao alone was the one who assumed an\noutward sham air of distress, while in her heart she felt her wishes\ngratified.",
        "The fourth day arrived. At an early hour Pao-yü suddenly opened his eyes\nand addressed himself to his grandmother Chia. “From this day forward,\"\nhe said, “I may no longer abide in your house, so you had better send me\noff at once!”",
        "These words made dowager lady Chia feel as if her very heart had been\nwrenched out of her. Mrs. Chao, who stood by, exhorted her. “You\nshouldn’t, venerable lady,” she said, “indulge in excessive grief. This\nyoung man has been long ago of no good; so wouldn’t it be as well to\ndress him up and let him go back a moment sooner from this world. You’ll\nalso be thus sparing him considerable suffering. But, if you persist, in\nnot reconciling yourself to the separation and this breath of his is not\ncut off, he will lie there and suffer without any respite....”",
        "Her arguments were scarcely ended, when she was spat upon by dowager\nlady Chia. “You rotten-tongued, good-for-nothing hag!” she cried\nabusively. “What makes you fancy him of no good! You wish him dead and\ngone; but what benefit will you then derive? Don’t give way to any\ndreams; for, if he does die, I’ll just exact your lives from you! It’s\nall because you’ve been continuously at him, inciting and urging him to\nread and write, that his spirit has become so intimidated that, at the\nsight of his father, he behaves just like a rat trying to get out of the\nway of a cat! And is not all this the result of the bullying of such a\nmean herd of women as yourselves! Could you now drive him to death, your\nwishes would immediately be fulfilled; but which of you will I let off?”",
        "Now she shed tears; now she gave vent to abuse.",
        "Chia Cheng, who stood by, heard these invectives; and they so enhanced\nhis exasperation that he promptly shouted out and made Mrs. Chao\nwithdraw. He then exerted himself for a time to console (his senior) by\nusing kindly accents. But suddenly some one came to announce that the\ntwo coffins had been completed. This announcement pierced, like a\ndagger, dowager lady Chia to the heart; and while weeping with despair\nmore intense, she broke forth in violent upbraidings.",
        "“Who is it,\"–she inquired; “who gave orders to make the coffins? Bring\nat once the coffin-makers and beat them to death!”",
        "A stir ensued sufficient to convulse the heavens and to subvert the\nearth. But at an unforeseen moment resounded in the air the gentle\nrapping of a ’wooden fish’ bell. A voice recited the sentence: “Ave!\nBuddha able to unravel retribution and dispel grievances! Should any\nhuman being lie in sickness, and his family be solicitous on his\naccount; or should any one have met with evil spirits and come across\nany baleful evils, we have the means to effect a cure.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang at once directed servants to go out\ninto the street and find out who it was. It turned out to be, in fact, a\nmangy-headed bonze and a hobbling Taoist priest. What was the appearance\nof the bonze?",
        "  His nose like a suspended gall; his two eyebrows so long,\n  His eyes, resembling radiant stars, possessed a precious glow,\n  His coat in tatters and his shoes of straw, without a home;\n  Rolling in filth, and, a worse fate, his head one mass of boils.",
        "And the Taoist priest, what was he like?",
        "  With one leg perchèd high he comes, with one leg low;\n  His whole frame drenching wet, bespattered all with mud.\n  If you perchance meet him, and ask him where’s his home,\n  “In fairyland, west of the ’Weak Water,’ he’ll say.”",
        "Chia Cheng ordered the servants to invite them to walk in. “On what\nhill,” he asked those two persons, “do you cultivate the principles of\nreason?",
        "“Worthy official!” the bonze smiled, “you must not ask too many\nquestions! It’s because we’ve learnt that there are inmates of your\nhonourable mansion in a poor state of health that we come with the\nexpress design of working a cure.”",
        "“There are,” explained Chia Cheng, “two of our members, who have been\npossessed of evil spirits. But, is there, I wonder, any remedy by means\nof which they could he healed?”",
        "“In your family,” laughingly observed the Taoist priest, “you have ready\nat hand a precious thing, the like of which is rare to find in the\nworld. It possesses the virtue of alleviating the ailment, so why need\nyou inquire about remedies?”",
        "Chia Cheng’s mind was forthwith aroused. “It’s true,” he consequently\nrejoined, “that my son brought along with him, at the time of his birth,\na piece of jade, on the surface of which was inscribed that it had the\nvirtue of dispelling evil influences, but we haven’t seen any efficacy\nin it.”",
        "“There is, worthy officer,” said the bonze, “something in it which you\ndo not understand. That precious jade was, in its primitive state,\nefficacious, but consequent upon its having been polluted by music,\nlewdness, property and gain it has lost its spiritual properties. But\nproduce now that valuable thing and wait till I have taken it into my\nhands and pronounced incantations over it, when it will become as full\nof efficacy as of old!”",
        "Chia Cheng accordingly unclasped the piece of jade from Pao-yü’s neck,\nand handed it to the two divines. The Buddhist priest held it with\nreverence in the palm of his hand and heaving a deep sigh, “Since our\nparting,” he cried, “at the foot of the Ch’ing Keng peak, about thirteen\nyears have elapsed. How time flies in the mortal world! Thine earthly\ndestiny has not yet been determined. Alas, alas! how admirable were the\nqualities thou did’st possess in those days!",
        " “By Heaven unrestrained, without constraint from Earth,\n  No joys lived in thy heart, but sorrows none as well;\n  Yet when perception, through refinement, thou did’st reach,\n  Thou went’st among mankind to trouble to give rise.\n  How sad the lot which thou of late hast had to hear!\n  Powder prints and rouge stains thy precious lustre dim.\n  House bars both day and night encage thee like a duck.\n  Deep wilt thou sleep, but from thy dream at length thou’lt wake,\n  Thy debt of vengeance, once discharged, thou wilt depart.”",
        "At the conclusion of this recital, he again rubbed the stone for a\nwhile, and gave vent to some nonsensical utterances, after which he\nsurrendered it to Chia Cheng. “This object,” he said, “has already\nresumed its efficacy; but you shouldn’t do anything to desecrate it.\nHang it on the post of the door in his bed-room, and with the exception\nof his own relatives, you must not let any outside female pollute it.\nAfter the expiry of thirty-three days, he will, I can guarantee, be all\nright.”",
        "Chia Cheng then gave orders to present tea; but the two priests had\nalready walked away. He had, however, no alternative but to comply with\ntheir injunctions, and lady Feng and Pao-yü, in point of fact, got\nbetter from day to day. Little by little they returned to their senses\nand experienced hunger. Dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang, at length,\nfelt composed in their minds. All the cousins heard the news outside.\nTai-yü, previous to anything else, muttered a prayer to Buddha; while\nPao-ch’ai laughed and said not a word.",
        "“Sister Pao,” inquired Hsi Ch’un, “what are you laughing for?”",
        "“I laugh,” replied Pao-ch’ai, “because the ’Thus-Come’ Joss has more to\ndo than any human being. He’s got to see to the conversion of all\nmankind, and to take care of the ailments, to which all flesh is heir;\nfor he restores every one of them at once to health; and he has as well\nto control people’s marriages so as to bring them about through his aid;\nand what do you say, has he ample to do or not? Now, isn’t this enough\nto make one laugh, eh?”",
        "Lin Tai-yü blushed. “Ts’ui!” she exclaimed; “none of you are good\npeople. Instead of following the example of worthy persons, you try to\nrival the mean mouth of that hussey Feng.”",
        "As she uttered these words, she raised the portiere and made her exit.",
        "But, reader, do you want to know any further circumstances? If so, the\nnext chapter will explain them to you.",
        "  On the Feng Yao bridge, Hsiao Hung makes known sentimental matters in\n      equivocal language.\n  In the Hsiao Hsiang lodge, Tai-yü gives, while under the effects of\n      the spring lassitude, expression to her secret feelings.",
        "After thirty days’ careful nursing, Pao-yü, we will now notice, not only\ngot strong and hale in body, but the scars even on his face completely\nhealed up; so he was able to shift his quarters again into the garden of\nBroad Vista.",
        "But we will banish this topic as it does not deserve any additional\nexplanations. Let us now turn our attention elsewhere. During the time\nthat Pao-yü was of late laid up in bed, Chia Yün along with the young\npages of the household sat up on watch to keep an eye over him, and both\nday and night, they tarried on this side of the mansion. But Hsiao Hung\nas well as all the other waiting-maids remained in the same part to\nnurse Pao-yü, so (Chia Yün) and she saw a good deal of each other on\nseveral occasions, and gradually an intimacy sprung up between them.",
        "Hsiao Hung observed that Chia Yün held in his hand a handkerchief very\nmuch like the one she herself had dropped some time ago and was bent\nupon asking him for it, but she did, on the other hand, not think she\ncould do so with propriety. The unexpected visit of the bonze and Taoist\npriest rendered, however, superfluous the services of the various male\nattendants, and Chia-yün had therefore to go again and oversee the men\nplanting the trees. Now she had a mind to drop the whole question, but\nshe could not reconcile herself to it; and now she longed to go and ask\nhim about it, but fears rose in her mind lest people should entertain\nany suspicions as to the relations that existed between them. But just\nas she faltered, quite irresolute, and her heart was thoroughly\nunsettled, she unawares heard some one outside inquire: “Sister, are you\nin the room or not?”",
        "Hsiao Hung, upon catching this question, looked out through a hole in\nthe window; and perceiving at a glance that it was no one else than a\nyoung servant-girl, attached to the same court as herself, Chia Hui by\nname, she consequently said by way of reply: “Yes, I am; come in!”",
        "When these words reached her ear, Chia Hui ran in, and taking at once a\nseat on the bed, she observed with a smile: “How lucky I’ve been! I was\na little time back in the court washing a few things, when Pao-yü cried\nout that some tea should be sent over to Miss Lin, and sister Hua handed\nit to me to go on the errand. By a strange coincidence our old lady had\npresented some money to Miss Lin and she was engaged at the moment in\ndistributing it among their servant-girls. As soon therefore as she saw\nme get there, Miss Lin forthwith grasped two handfuls of cash and gave\nthem to me; how many there are I don’t know, but do keep them for me!”",
        "Speedily then opening her handkerchief, she emptied the cash. Hsiao Hung\ncounted them for her by fives and tens at a time. She was beginning to\nput them away, when Chia Hui remarked: “How are you, after all, feeling\nof late in your mind? I’ll tell you what; you should really go and stay\nat home for a couple of days. And were you to ask a doctor round and to\nhave a few doses of medicine you’ll get all right at once!”",
        "“What are you talking about?” Hsiao Hung replied. “What shall I go home\nfor, when there’s neither rhyme nor reason for it!”",
        "“Miss Lin, I remember, is naturally of a weak physique, and has\nconstantly to take medicines,” Chia Hui added, “so were you to ask her\nfor some and bring them over and take them, it would come to the same\nthing.”",
        "“Nonsense!” rejoined Hsiao Hung, “are medicines also to be recklessly\ntaken ?”",
        "“You can’t so on for ever like this,” continued Chia Hui; “you’re\nbesides loth to eat and loth to drink, and what will you be like in the\nlong run?”",
        "“What’s there to fear?” observed Hsiao Hung; “won’t it anyhow be better\nto die a little earlier? It would be a riddance!”",
        "“Why do you deliberately come out with all this talk?” Chia Hui\ndemurred.",
        "“How could you ever know anything of the secrets of my heart?” Hsiao\nHung inquired.",
        "Chia Hui nodded her head and gave way to reflection. “I don’t think it\nstrange on your part,” she said after a time; “for it is really\r\r\ndifficult to abide in this place! Yesterday, for instance, our dowager\nlady remarked that the servants in attendance had had, during all the\ndays that Pao-yü was ill, a good deal to put up with, and that now that\nhe has recovered, incense should be burnt everywhere, and the vows\nfulfilled; and she expressed a wish that those in his service should,\none and all, be rewarded according to their grade. I and several others\ncan be safely looked upon as young in years, and unworthy to presume so\nhigh; so I don’t feel in any way aggrieved; but how is it that one like\nyou couldn’t be included in the number? My heart is much annoyed at it!\nHad there been any fear that Hsi Jen would have got ten times more, I\ncould not even then have felt sore against her, for she really deserves\nit! I’ll just tell you an honest truth; who else is there like her? Not\nto speak of the diligence and carefulness she has displayed all along,\neven had she not been so diligent and careful, she couldn’t have been\nset aside! But what is provoking is that that lot, like Ch’ing Wen and\nCh’i Hsia, should have been included in the upper class. Yet it’s\nbecause every one places such reliance on the fine reputation of their\nfather and mother that they exalt them. Now, do tell me, is this\nsufficient to anger one or not?”",
        "“It won’t do to be angry with them!” Hsiao Hung observed. “The proverb\nsays: ’You may erect a shed a thousand li long, but there is no\nentertainment from which the guests will not disperse!’ And who is it\nthat will tarry here for a whole lifetime? In another three years or\nfive years every single one of us will have gone her own way; and who\nwill, when that time comes, worry her mind about any one else?”",
        "These allusions had the unexpected effect of touching Chia Hui to the\nheart; and in spite of herself the very balls of her eyes got red. But\nso uneasy did she feel at crying for no reason that she had to exert\nherself to force a smile. “What you say is true,” she ventured. “And\nyet, Pao-yü even yesterday explained how the rooms should be arranged by\nand bye; and how the clothes should be made, just as if he was bound to\nhang on to dear life for several hundreds of years.”",
        "Hsiao Hung, at these words, gave a couple of sardonic smiles. But when\nabout to pass some remark, she perceived a youthful servant-girl, who\nhad not as yet let her hair grow, walk in, holding in her hands several\npatterns and two sheets of paper. “You are asked,” she said, “to trace\nthese two designs!”",
        "As she spoke, she threw them at Hsiao Hung, and twisting herself round,\nshe immediately scampered away.",
        "“Whose are they, after all?” Hsiao Hung inquired, addressing herself\noutside. “Couldn’t you wait even so much as to conclude what you had to\nsay, but flew off at once? Who is steaming bread and waiting for you? Or\nare you afraid, forsooth, lest it should get cold?”",
        "“They belong to sister Ch’i,” the young servant-girl merely returned for\nanswer from outside the window; and raising her feet high, she ran\ntramp-tramp on her way back again.",
        "Hsiao Hung lost control over her temper, and snatching the designs, she\nflung them on one side. She then rummaged in a drawer for a pencil, but\nfinding, after a prolonged search, that they were all blunt; “Where did\nI,” she thereupon ejaculated, “put that brand-new pencil the other day?\nHow is it I can’t remember where it is?”",
        "While she soliloquised, she became wrapt in thought. After some\nreflection she, at length, gave a smile. “Of course!” she exclaimed,\n\"the other evening Ying Erh took it away.” And turning towards Chia Hui,\n\"Fetch it for me,” she shouted.",
        "“Sister Hua,” Chia Hui rejoined, “is waiting for me to get a box for\nher, so you had better go for it yourself!”",
        "“What!” remarked Hsiao Hung, “she’s waiting for you, and are you still\nsquatting here chatting leisurely? Hadn’t it been that I asked you to go\nand fetch it, she too wouldn’t have been waiting for you; you most\nperverse vixen!”",
        "With these words on her lips, she herself walked out of the room, and\nleaving the I Hung court, she straightway proceeded in the direction of\nPao-ch’ai’s court. As soon, however, as she reached the Hsin Fang\npavilion, she saw dame Li, Pao-yü’s nurse, appear in view from the\nopposite side; so Hsiao Hung halted and putting on a smile, “Nurse Li,\"\nshe asked, “where are you, old dame, bound for? How is it you’re coming\nthis way?”",
        "Nurse Li stopped short, and clapped her hands. “Tell me,” she said, “has\nhe deliberately again gone and fallen in love with that Mr. something or\nother like Yun (cloud), or Yü (rain)? They now insist upon my bringing\nhim inside, but if they get wind of it by and bye in the upper rooms, it\nwon’t again be a nice thing.”",
        "“Are you, old lady,” replied Hsiao Hung smiling, “taking things in such\nreal earnest that you readily believe them and want to go and ask him in\nhere?”",
        "“What can I do?” rejoined nurse Li.",
        "“Why, that fellow,” added Hsiao Hung laughingly, “will, if he has any\nidea of decency, do the right thing and not come.”",
        "“Besides, he’s not a fool!” pleaded nurse Li; “so why shouldn’t he come\nin?”",
        "“Well, if he is to come,” answered Hsiao Hung, “it will devolve upon\nyou, worthy dame, to lead him along with you; for were you by and bye to\nlet him penetrate inside all alone and knock recklessly about, why, it\nwon’t do at all.”",
        "“Have I got all that leisure,” retorted nurse Li, “to trudge along with\nhim? I’ll simply tell him to come; and later on I can despatch a young\nservant-girl or some old woman to bring him in, and have done.”",
        "Saying this, she continued her way, leaning on her staff.",
        "After listening to her rejoinder, Hsiao Hung stood still; and plunging\nin abstraction, she did not go and fetch the pencil. But presently, she\ncaught sight of a servant-girl running that way. Espying Hsiao Hung\nlingering in that spot, “Sister Hung,” she cried, “what are you doing in\nhere?”",
        "Hsiao Hung raised her head, and recognised a young waiting-maid called\nChui Erh. “Where are you off too?” Hsiao Hung asked.",
        "“I’ve been told to bring in master Secundus, Mr. Yün,” Chui Erh replied.\nAfter which answer, she there and then departed with all speed.",
        "Hsiao Hung reached, meanwhile, the Feng Yao bridge. As soon as she\napproached the gateway, she perceived Chui Erh coming along with Chia\nYün from the opposite direction. While advancing Chia Yün ogled Hsiao\nHung; and Hsiao Hung too, though pretending to be addressing herself to\nChui Erh, cast a glance at Chia Yün; and their four eyes, as luck would\nhave it, met. Hsiao Hung involuntarily blushed all over; and turning\nherself round, she walked off towards the Heng Wu court. But we will\nleave her there without further remarks.",
        "During this time, Chia Yün followed Chui Erh, by a circuitous way, into\nthe I Hung court. Chui Erh entered first and made the necessary\nannouncement. Then subsequently she ushered in Chia Yün. When Chia Yün\nscrutinised the surroundings, he perceived, here and there in the court,\nseveral blocks of rockery, among which were planted banana-trees. On the\nopposite side were two storks preening their feathers under the fir\ntrees. Under the covered passage were suspended, in a row, cages of\nevery description, containing all sorts of fairylike, rare birds. In the\nupper part were five diminutive anterooms, uniformly carved with, unique\ndesigns; and above the framework of the door was hung a tablet with the\ninscription in four huge characters–\"I Hung K’uai Lü, the happy red and\njoyful green.”",
        "“I thought it strange,” Chia Yün argued mentally, “that it should be\ncalled the I Hung court; but are these, in fact, the four characters\ninscribed on the tablet!”",
        "But while he was communing within himself, he heard some one laugh and\nthen exclaim from the inner side of the gauze window: “Come in at once!\nHow is it that I’ve forgotten you these two or three months?”",
        "As soon as Chia Yün recognised Pao-yü’s voice, he entered the room with\nhurried step. On raising his head, his eye was attracted by the\nbrilliant splendour emitted by gold and jade and by the dazzling lustre\nof the elegant arrangements. He failed, however, to detect where Pao-yü\nwas ensconced. The moment he turned his head round, he espied, on the\nleft side, a large cheval-glass; behind which appeared to view, standing\nside by side, two servant-girls of fifteen or sixteen years of age.\n\"Master Secundus,” they ventured, “please take a seat in the inner\nroom.”",
        "Chia Yün could not even muster courage to look at them straight in the\nface; but promptly assenting, he walked into a green gauze\nmosquito-house, where he saw a small lacquered bed, hung with curtains\nof a deep red colour, with clusters of flowers embroidered in gold.\nPao-yü, wearing a house-dress and slipshod shoes, was reclining on the\nbed, a book in hand. The moment he perceived Chia Yün walk in, he\ndiscarded his book, and forthwith smiled and raised himself up. Chia Yün\nhurriedly pressed forward and paid his salutation. Pao-yü then offered\nhim a seat; but he simply chose a chair in the lower part of the\napartment.",
        "“Ever since the moon in which I came across you,” Pao-yü observed\nsmilingly, “and told you to come into the library, I’ve had, who would\nhave thought it, endless things to continuously attend to, so that I\nforgot all about you.”",
        "“It’s I, indeed, who lacked good fortune!” rejoined Chia Yün, with a\nlaugh; “particularly so, as it again happened that you, uncle, fell ill.\nBut are you quite right once more?”",
        "“All right!” answered Pao-yü. “I heard that you’ve been put to much\ntrouble and inconvenience on a good number of days!”",
        "“Had I even had any trouble to bear,” added Chia Yün, “it would have\r\nbeen my duty to bear it. But your complete recovery, uncle, is really a\nblessing to our whole family.”",
        "As he spoke, he discerned a couple of servant-maids come to help him to\na cup of tea. But while conversing with Pao-yü, Chia Yün was intent upon\nscrutinising the girl with slim figure, and oval face, and clad in a\nsilvery-red jacket, a blue satin waistcoat and a white silk petticoat\nwith narrow pleats.",
        "At the time of Pao-yü’s illness, Chia Yün had spent a couple of days in\nthe inner apartments, so that he remembered half of the inmates of note,\nand the moment he set eyes upon this servant-girl he knew that it was\nHsi Jen; and that she was in Pao-yü’s rooms on a different standing to\nthe rest. Now therefore that she brought the tea in herself and that\nPao-yü was, besides, sitting by, he rose to his feet with alacrity and\nput on a smile. “Sister,” he said, “how is it that you are pouring tea\nfor me? I came here to pay uncle a visit; what’s more I’m no stranger,\nso let me pour it with my own hands!”",
        "“Just you sit down and finish!” Pao-yü interposed; “will you also behave\nin this fashion with servant-girls?”",
        "“In spite of what you say;” remarked Chia Yün smiling, “they are young\nladies attached to your rooms, uncle, and how could I presume to be\ndisorderly in my conduct?”",
        "So saying, he took a seat and drank his tea. Pao-yü then talked to him\nabout trivial and irrelevant matters; and afterwards went on to tell him\nin whose household the actresses were best, and whose gardens were\npretty. He further mentioned to him in whose quarters the servant-girls\nwere handsome, whose banquets were sumptuous, as well as in whose home\nwere to be found strange things, and what family possessed remarkable\nobjects. Chia Yün was constrained to humour him in his conversation; but\nafter a chat, which lasted for some time, he noticed that Pao-yü was\nsomewhat listless, and he promptly stood up and took his leave. And\nPao-yü too did not use much pressure to detain him. “To-morrow, if you\nhave nothing to do, do come over!” he merely observed; after which, he\nagain bade the young waiting-maid, Chui Erh, see him out.",
        "Having left the I Hung court, Chia Yün cast a glance all round; and,\nrealising that there was no one about, he slackened his pace at once,\nand while proceeding leisurely, he conversed, in a friendly way, with\nChui Erh on one thing and another. First and foremost he inquired of her\nwhat was her age; and her name. “Of what standing are your father and\nmother?” he said, “How many years have you been in uncle Pao’s\napartments? How much money do you get a month? In all how many girls are\nthere in uncle Pao’s rooms?”",
        "As Chui Erh heard the questions set to her, she readily made suitable\nreply to each.",
        "“The one, who was a while back talking to you,” continued Chia Yün, “is\ncalled Hsiao Hung, isn’t she?”",
        "“Yes, her name is Hsiao Hung!” replied Chui Erh smiling; “but why do you\nask about her?”",
        "“She inquired of you just now about some handkerchief or other,\"\nanswered Chia Yün; “well, I’ve picked one up.”",
        "Chui Erh greeted this response with a smile. “Many are the times,” she\nsaid; “that she has asked me whether I had seen her handkerchief; but\nhave I got all that leisure to worry my mind about such things? She\nspoke to me about it again to-day; and she suggested that I should find\nit for her, and that she would also recompense me. This she told me when\nwe were just now at the entrance of the Heng Wu court, and you too, Mr.\nSecundus, overheard her, so that I’m not lying. But, dear Mr. Secundus,\nsince you’ve picked it up, give it to me. Do! And I’ll see what she will\ngive me as a reward.”",
        "The truth is that Chia Yün had, the previous moon when he had come into\nthe garden to attend to the planting of trees, picked up a handkerchief,\nwhich he conjectured must have been dropped by some inmate of those\ngrounds; but as he was not aware whose it was, he did not consequently\npresume to act with indiscretion. But on this occasion, he overheard\nHsiao Hung make inquiries of Chui Erh on the subject; and concluding\nthat it must belong to her, he felt immeasurably delighted. Seeing,\nbesides, how importunate Chui Erh was, he at once devised a plan within\nhimself, and vehemently producing from his sleeve a handkerchief of his\nown, he observed, as he turned towards Chui Erh with a smile: “As for\ngiving it to you, I’ll do so; but in the event of your obtaining any\npresent from her, you mustn’t impose upon me.”",
        "Chui Erh assented to his proposal most profusely; and, taking the\nhandkerchief, she saw Chia Yün out and then came back in search of Hsiao\nHung. But we will leave her there for the present.",
        "We will now return to Pao-yü. After dismissing Chia Yün, he lay in such\ncomplete listlessness on the bed that he betrayed every sign of being\nhalf asleep. Hsi Jen walked up to him, and seated herself on the edge of\nthe bed, and pushing him, “What are you about to go to sleep again,” she\nsaid. “Would it not do your languid spirits good if you went out for a\nbit of a stroll?”",
        "Upon hearing her voice, Pao-yü grasped her hand in his. “I would like to\ngo out,” he smiled, “but I can’t reconcile myself to the separation from\nyou!”",
        "“Get up at once!” laughed Hsi Jen. And as she uttered these words, she\npulled Pao-yü up.",
        "“Where can I go?” exclaimed Pao-yü. “I’m quite surfeited with\neverything.”",
        "“Once out you’ll be all right,” Hsi Jen answered, “but if you simply\ngive way to this languor, you’ll be more than ever sick of everything at\nheart.”",
        "Pao-yü could not do otherwise, dull and out of sorts though he was, than\naccede to her importunities. Strolling leisurely out of the door of the\nroom, he amused himself a little with the birds suspended under the\nverandah; then he wended his steps outside the court, and followed the\ncourse of the Hsin Fang stream; but after admiring the golden fish for a\ntime, he espied, on the opposite hillock, two young deer come rushing\ndown as swift as an arrow. What they were up to Pao-yü could not\ndiscern; but while abandoning himself to melancholy, he caught sight of\nChia Lan, following behind, with a small bow in his hand, and hurrying\ndown hill in pursuit of them.",
        "As soon as he realised that Pao-yü stood ahead of him, he speedily\nhalted. “Uncle Secundus,” he smiled, “are you at home? I imagined you\nhad gone out of doors!”",
        "“You are up to mischief again, eh?” Pao-yü rejoined. “They’ve done\nnothing to you, and why shoot at them with your arrows?”",
        "“I had no studies to attend to just now, so, being free with nothing to\ndo,” Chia Lan replied laughingly, “I was practising riding and archery.”",
        "“Shut up!” exclaimed Pao-yü. “When are you not engaged in practising?”",
        "Saying this, he continued his way and straightway reached the entrance\nof a court. Here the bamboo foliage was thick, and the breeze sighed\ngently. This was the Hsiao Hsiang lodge. Pao-yü listlessly rambled in.\nHe saw a bamboo portière hanging down to the ground. Stillness\nprevailed. Not a human voice fell on the ear. He advanced as far as the\nwindow. Noticing that a whiff of subtle scent stole softly through the\ngreen gauze casement, Pao-yü applied his face closely against the frame\nto peep in, but suddenly he caught the faint sound of a deep sigh and\nthe words: “Day after day my feelings slumber drowsily!” Upon\noverhearing this exclamation, Pao-yü unconsciously began to feel a prey\nto inward longings; but casting a second glance, he saw Tai-yü\nstretching herself on the bed.",
        "“Why is it,” smiled Pao-yü, from outside the window, “that your feelings\nday after day slumber drowsily?” So saying, he raised the portière and\nstepped in.",
        "The consciousness that she had not been reticent about her feelings made\nTai-yü unwittingly flush scarlet. Taking hold of her sleeve, she\nscreened her face; and, turning her body round towards the inside, she\npretended to be fast asleep. Pao-yü drew near her. He was about to pull\nher round when he saw Tai-yü’s nurse enter the apartment, followed by\ntwo matrons.",
        "“Is Miss asleep?” they said. “If so, we’ll ask her over, when she wakes\nup.”",
        "As these words were being spoken, Tai-yü eagerly twisted herself round\nand sat up. “Who’s asleep?” she laughed.",
        "“We thought you were fast asleep, Miss,” smiled the two or three matrons\nas soon as they perceived Tai-yü get up. This greeting over, they called\nTzu Chüan. “Your young mistress,” they said, “has awoke; come in and\nwait on her!”",
        "While calling her, they quitted the room in a body. Tai-yü remained\nseated on the bed. Raising her arms, she adjusted her hair, and\nsmilingly she observed to Pao-yü, “When people are asleep, what do you\nwalk in for?”",
        "At the sight of her half-closed starlike eyes and of her fragrant\ncheeks, suffused with a crimson blush, Pao-yü’s feelings were of a\nsudden awakened; so, bending his body, he took a seat on a chair, and\nasked with a smile: “What were you saying a short while back?”",
        "“I wasn’t saying anything,” Tai-yü replied.",
        "“What a lie you’re trying to ram down my throat!” laughed Pao-yü. “I\nheard all.”",
        "But in the middle of their colloquy, they saw Tzu Chüan enter. Pao-yü\nthen put on a smiling face. “Tzu Chüan!” he cried, “pour me a cup of\nyour good tea!”",
        "“Where’s the good tea to be had?” Tzu Chüan answered. “If you want good\ntea, you’d better wait till Hsi Jen comes.”",
        "“Don’t heed him!” interposed Tai-yü. “Just go first and draw me some\nwater.”",
        "“He’s a visitor,” remonstrated Tzu Chüan, “and, of course, I should\nfirst pour him a cup of tea, and then go and draw the water.”",
        "With this answer, she started to serve the tea.",
        "“My dear girl,” Pao-yü exclaimed laughingly, “If I could only share the\nsame bridal curtain with your lovable young mistress, would I ever be\nable (to treat you as a servant) by making you fold the covers and make\nthe beds.”",
        "Lin Tai-yü at once drooped her head. “What are you saying?” she\nremonstrated.",
        "“What, did I say anything?” smiled Pao-yü.",
        "Tai-yü burst into tears. “You’ve recently,” she observed, “got into a\nnew way. Whatever slang you happen to hear outside you come and tell me.\nAnd whenever you read any improper book, you poke your fun at me. What!\nhave I become a laughing-stock for gentlemen!”",
        "As she began to cry, she jumped down from bed, and promptly left the\nroom. Pao-yü was at a loss how to act. So agitated was he that he\nhastily ran up to her, “My dear cousin,” he pleaded, “I do deserve\ndeath; but don’t go and tell any one! If again I venture to utter such\nkind of language, may blisters grow on my mouth and may my tongue waste\naway!”",
        "But while appealing to her feelings, he saw Hsi Jen approach him. “Go\nback at once,” she cried, “and put on your clothes as master wants to\nsee you.”",
        "At the very mention of his father, Pao-yü felt suddenly as if struck by\nlightning. Regardless of everything and anything, he rushed, as fast as\npossible, back to his room, and changing his clothes, he came out into\nthe garden. Here he discovered Pei Ming, standing at the second gateway,\nwaiting for him.",
        "“Do you perchance know what he wants me for?” Pao-yü inquired.",
        "“Master, hurry out at once!” Pei Ming replied. “You must, of course, go\nand see him. When you get there, you are sure to find out what it’s all\nabout.”",
        "This said, he urged Pao-yü on, and together they turned past the large\npavilion. Pao-yü was, however, still labouring under suspicion, when he\nheard, from the corner of the wall, a loud outburst of laughter. Upon\nturning his head round, he caught sight of Hsüeh P’an jump out, clapping\nhis hands. “Hadn’t I said that my uncle wanted you?” he laughed. “Would\nyou ever have rushed out with such alacrity?”",
        "Pei Ming also laughed, and fell on his knees. But Pao-yü remained for a\nlong time under the spell of utter astonishment, before he, at length,\nrealised that it was Hsüeh P’au who had inveigled him to come out.",
        "Hsüeh P’an hastily made a salutation and a curtsey, and confessed his\nfault. He next gave way to entreaties, saying: “Don’t punish the young\nservant, for it is simply I who begged him go.”",
        "Pao-yü too had then no other alternative but to smile. “I don’t mind\nyour playing your larks on me; but why,” he inquired, “did you mention\nmy father? Were I to go and tell my aunt, your mother, to see to the\nrights and the wrongs of the case, how would you like it?”",
        "“My dear cousin,” remarked Hsüeh P’an vehemently, “the primary idea I\nhad in view was to ask you to come out a moment sooner and I forgot to\nrespectfully shun the expression. But by and bye, when you wish to chaff\nme, just you likewise allude to my father, and we’ll thus be square.”",
        "“Ai-ya!” exclaimed Pao-yü. “You do more than ever deserve death!!” Then\nturning again towards Pei Ming, “You ruffian!” he said, “what are you\nstill kneeling for?”",
        "Pei Ming began to bump his head on the ground with vehemence.",
        "“Had it been for anything else,” Hsüeh P’an chimed in, “I wouldn’t have\nmade bold to disturb you; but it’s simply in connection with my birthday\nwhich is to-morrow, the third day of the fifth moon. Ch’eng Jih-hsing,\nwho is in that curio shop of ours, unexpectedly brought along, goodness\nknows where he fished them from, fresh lotus so thick and so long, so\nmealy and so crisp; melons of this size; and a Siamese porpoise, that\nlong and that big, smoked with cedar, such as is sent as tribute from\nthe kingdom of Siam. Are not these four presents, pray, rare delicacies?\nThe porpoise is not only expensive, but difficult to get, and that kind\nof lotus and melon must have cost him no end of trouble to grow! I lost\nno time in presenting some to my mother, and at once sent some to your\nold grandmother, and my aunt. But a good many of them still remain now;\nand were I to eat them all alone, it would, I fear, be more than I\ndeserve; so I concluded, after thinking right and left, that there was,\nbesides myself, only you good enough to partake of some. That is why I\nspecially invite you to taste them. But, as luck would have it, a young\nsinging-boy has also come, so what do you say to you and I having a\njolly day of it?”",
        "As they talked, they walked; and, as they walked, they reached the\ninterior of the library. Here they discovered a whole assemblage\nconsisting of Tan Kuang, Ch’eng Jih-hsing, Hu Ch’i-lai, Tan T’ing-jen\nand others, and the singing-boy as well. As soon as these saw Pao-yü\nwalk in, some paid their respects to him; others inquired how he was;\nand after the interchange of salutations, tea was drunk. Hsüeh P’an then\ngave orders to serve the wine. Scarcely were the words out of his mouth\nthan the servant-lads bustled and fussed for a long while laying the\ntable. When at last the necessary arrangements had been completed, the\ncompany took their seats.",
        "Pao-yü verily found the melons and lotus of an exceptional description.\n\"My birthday presents have not as yet been sent round,” he felt impelled\nto say, a smile on his lips, “and here I come, ahead of them, to\ntrespass on your hospitality.”",
        "“Just so!” retorted Hsüeh P’an, “but when you come to-morrow to\ncongratulate me we’ll consider what novel kind of present you can give\nme.”",
        "“I’ve got nothing that I can give you,” rejoined Pao-yü. “As far as\nmoney, clothes, eatables and other such articles go, they are not really\nmine: all I can call my own are such pages of characters that I may\nwrite, or pictures that I may draw.”",
        "“Your reference to pictures,” added Hsüeh P’an smiling, “reminds me of a\nbook I saw yesterday, containing immodest drawings; they were, truly,\nbeautifully done. On the front page there figured also a whole lot of\ncharacters. But I didn’t carefully look at them; I simply noticed the\nname of the person, who had executed them. It was, in fact, something or\nother like Keng Huang. The pictures were, actually, exceedingly good!”",
        "This allusion made Pao-yü exercise his mind with innumerable\nconjectures.",
        "“Of pictures drawn from past years to the present, I have,” he said,\n\"seen a good many, but I’ve never come across any Keng Huang.”",
        "After considerable thought, he could not repress himself from bursting\nout laughing. Then asking a servant to fetch him a pencil, he wrote a\ncouple of words on the palm of his hand. This done, he went on to\ninquire of Hsüeh. P’an: “Did you see correctly that it read Keng Huang?”",
        "“How could I not have seen correctly?” ejaculated Hsüeh P’an.",
        "Pao-yü thereupon unclenched his hand and allowed him to peruse, what was\nwritten in it. “Were they possibly these two characters?” he remarked.\n\"These are, in point of fact, not very dissimilar from what Keng Huang\nlook like?”",
        "On scrutinising them, the company noticed the two words T’ang Yin, and\nthey all laughed. “They must, we fancy, have been these two characters!\"\nthey cried. “Your eyes, Sir, may, there’s no saying, have suddenly grown\ndim!”",
        "Hsüeh P’an felt utterly abashed. “Who could have said,” he smiled,\n\"whether they were T’ang Yin or Kuo Yin, (candied silver or fruit\nsilver).”",
        "As he cracked this joke, however, a young page came and announced that\nMr. Feng had arrived. Pao-yü concluded that the new comer must be Feng\nTzu-ying, the son of Feng T’ang, general with the prefix of Shen Wu.”",
        "“Ask him in at once,” Hsüeh P’an and his companions shouted with one\nvoice.",
        "But barely were these words out of their mouths, than they realised that\nFeng Tzu-ying had already stepped in, talking and laughing as he\napproached.",
        "The company speedily rose from table and offered him a seat.",
        "“That’s right!” smiled Feng Tzu-ying. “You don’t go out of doors, but\nremain at home and go in for high fun!”",
        "Both Pao-yü and Hsüeh P’an put on a smile. “We haven’t,” they remarked,\n\"seen you for ever so long. Is your venerable father strong and hale?”",
        "“My father,” rejoined Tzu-ying, “is, thanks to you, strong and hale; but\nmy mother recently contracted a sudden chill and has been unwell for a\ncouple of days.”",
        "Hsüeh P’an discerned on his face a slight bluish wound. “With whom have\nyou again been boxing,” he laughingly inquired, “that you’ve hung up\nthis sign board?”",
        "“Since the occasion,” laughed Feng Tzu-ying, “on which I wounded\nlieutenant-colonel Ch’ou’s son, I’ve borne the lesson in mind, and never\nlost my temper. So how is it you say that I’ve again been boxing? This\nthing on my face was caused, when I was out shooting the other day on\nthe T’ieh Wang hills, by a flap from the wing of the falcon.”",
        "“When was that?” asked Pao-yü.",
        "“I started,” explained Tzu-ying, “on the 28th of the third moon and came\nback only the day before yesterday.”",
        "“It isn’t to be wondered at then,” observed Pao-yü, “that when I went\nthe other day, on the third and fourth, to a banquet at friend Shen’s\nhouse, I didn’t see you there. Yet I meant to have inquired about you;\nbut I don’t know how it slipped from my memory. Did you go alone, or did\nyour venerable father accompany you?”",
        "“Of course, my father went,” Tzu-ying replied, “so I had no help but to\ngo. For is it likely, forsooth, that I’ve gone mad from lack of anything\nto do! Don’t we, a goodly number as we are, derive enough pleasure from\nour wine-bouts and plays that I should go in quest of such kind of\nfatiguing recreation! But in this instance a great piece of good fortune\nturned up in evil fortune!”",
        "Hsüeh P’an and his companions noticed that he had finished his tea.\n\"Come along,” they one and all proposed, “and join the banquet; you can\nthen quietly recount to us all your experiences.”",
        "At this suggestion Feng Tzu-ying there and then rose to his feet.\n\"According to etiquette,” he said. “I should join you in drinking a few\ncups; but to-day I have still a very urgent matter to see my father\nabout on my return so that I truly cannot accept your invitation.”",
        "Hsüeh P’an, Pao-yü and the other young fellows would on no account\nlisten to his excuses. They pulled him vigorously about and would not\nlet him go.",
        "“This is, indeed, strange!” laughed Feng Tzu-ying. “When have you and I\nhad, during all these years, to have recourse to such proceedings! I\nreally am unable to comply with your wishes. But if you do insist upon\nmaking me have a drink, well, then bring a large cup and I’ll take two\ncups full and finish.”",
        "After this rejoinder, the party could not but give in. Hsüeh P’an took\nhold of the kettle, while Pao-yü grasped the cup, and they poured two\nlarge cups full. Feng Tzu-ying stood up and quaffed them with one\ndraught.",
        "“But do, after all,” urged Pao-yü, “finish this thing about a piece of\ngood fortune in the midst of misfortune before you go.”",
        "“To tell you this to-day,” smiled Feng Tzu-ying, “will be no great fun.\nBut for this purpose I intend standing a special entertainment, and\ninviting you all to come and have a long chat; and, in the second place,\nI’ve also got a favour to ask of you.”",
        "Saying this, he pushed his way and was going off at once, when Hsüeh\nP’an interposed. “What you’ve said,” he observed, “has put us more than\never on pins and needles. We cannot brook any delay. Who knows when you\nwill ask us round; so better tell us, and thus avoid keeping people in\nsuspense!”",
        "“The latest,” rejoined Feng Tzu-ying, “in ten days; the earliest in\neight.” With this answer he went out of the door, mounted his horse, and\ntook his departure.",
        "The party resumed their seats at table. They had another bout, and then\neventually dispersed.",
        "Pao-yü returned into the garden in time to find Hsi Jen thinking with\nsolicitude that he had gone to see Chia Cheng and wondering whether it\nforeboded good or evil. As soon as she perceived Pao-yü come back in a\ndrunken state, she felt urged to inquire the reason of it all. Pao-yü\ntold her one by one the particulars of what happened.",
        "“People,” added Hsi Jen, “wait for you with lacerated heart and anxious\nmind, and there you go and make merry; yet you could very well, after\nall, have sent some one with a message.”",
        "“Didn’t I purpose sending a message?” exclaimed Pao-yü. “Of course, I\ndid! But I failed to do so, as on the arrival of friend Feng, I got so\nmixed up that the intention vanished entirely from my mind.”",
        "While excusing himself, he saw Pao-ch’ai enter the apartment. “Have you\ntasted any of our new things?” she asked, a smile curling her lips.",
        "“Cousin,” laughed Pao-yü, “you must have certainly tasted what you’ve\ngot in your house long before us.”",
        "Pao-ch’ai shook her head and smiled. “Yesterday,” she said, “my brother\ndid actually make it a point to ask me to have some; but I had none; I\ntold him to keep them and send them to others, so confident am I that\nwith my mean lot and scanty blessings I little deserve to touch such\ndainties.”",
        "As she spoke, a servant-girl poured her a cup of tea and brought it to\nher. While she sipped it, she carried on a conversation on irrelevant\nmatters; which we need not notice, but turn our attention to Lin Tai-yü.",
        "The instant she heard that Chia Cheng had sent for Pao-yü, and that he\nhad not come back during the whole day, she felt very distressed on his\naccount. After supper, the news of Pao-yü’s return reached her, and she\nkeenly longed to see him and ask him what was up. Step by step she\ntrudged along, when espying Pao-ch’ai going into Pao-yü’s garden, she\nherself followed close in her track. But on their arrival at the Hsin\nFang bridge, she caught sight of the various kinds of water-fowl,\nbathing together in the pond, and although unable to discriminate the\nnumerous species, her gaze became so transfixed by their respective\nvariegated and bright plumage and by their exceptional beauty, that she\nhalted. And it was after she had spent some considerable time in\nadmiring them that she repaired at last to the I Hung court. The gate\nwas already closed. Tai-yü, however, lost no time in knocking. But\nCh’ing Wen and Pi Hen had, who would have thought it, been having a\ntiff, and were in a captious mood, so upon unawares seeing Pao-ch’ai\nstep on the scene, Ch’ing Wen at once visited her resentment upon\nPao-ch’ai. She was just standing in the court giving vent to her wrongs,\nshouting: “You’re always running over and seating yourself here, whether\nyou’ve got good reason for doing so or not; and there’s no sleep for us\nat the third watch, the middle of the night though it be,” when, all of\na sudden, she heard some one else calling at the door. Ch’ing Wen was\nthe more moved to anger. Without even asking who it was, she rapidly\nbawled out: “They’ve all gone to sleep; you’d better come to-morrow.”",
        "Lin Tai-yü was well aware of the natural peculiarities of the\nwaiting-maids, and of their habit of playing practical jokes upon each\nother, so fearing that the girl in the inner room had failed to\nrecognise her voice, and had refused to open under the misconception\nthat it was some other servant-girl, she gave a second shout in a higher\npitch. “It’s I!” she cried, “don’t you yet open the gate?”",
        "Ch’ing Wen, as it happened, did not still distinguish her voice; and in\nan irritable strain, she rejoined: “It’s no matter who you may be; Mr.\nSecundus has given orders that no one at all should be allowed to come\nin.”",
        "As these words reached Lin Tai-yü’s ear, she unwittingly was overcome\nwith indignation at being left standing outside. But when on the point\nof raising her voice to ask her one or two things, and to start a\nquarrel with her; “albeit,” she again argued mentally, “I can call this\nmy aunt’s house, and it should be just as if it were my own, it’s, after\nall, a strange place, and now that my father and mother are both dead,\nand that I am left with no one to rely upon, I have for the present to\ndepend upon her family for a home. Were I now therefore to give way to a\nregular fit of anger with her, I’ll really get no good out of it.”",
        "While indulging in reflection, tears trickled from her eyes. But just as\nshe was feeling unable to retrace her steps, and unable to remain\nstanding any longer, and quite at a loss what to do, she overheard the\nsound of jocular language inside, and listening carefully, she\ndiscovered that it was, indeed, Pao-yü and Pao-ch’ai. Lin Tai-yü waxed\nmore wroth. After much thought and cogitation, the incidents of the\nmorning flashed unawares through her memory. “It must, in fact,” she\nmused, “be because Pao-yü is angry with me for having explained to him\nthe true reasons. But why did I ever go and tell you? You should,\nhowever, have made inquiries before you lost your temper to such an\nextent with me as to refuse to let me in to-day; but is it likely that\nwe shall not by and bye meet face to face again?”",
        "The more she gave way to thought, the more she felt wounded and\nagitated; and without heeding the moss, laden with cold dew, the path\ncovered with vegetation, and the chilly blasts of wind, she lingered all\nalone, under the shadow of the bushes at the corner of the wall, so\nthoroughly sad and dejected that she broke forth into sobs.",
        "Lin Tai-yü was, indeed, endowed with exceptional beauty and with charms\nrarely met with in the world. As soon therefore as she suddenly melted\ninto tears, and the birds and rooks roosting on the neighbouring willow\nboughs and branches of shrubs caught the sound of her plaintive tones,\nthey one and all fell into a most terrific flutter, and, taking to their\nwings, they flew away to distant recesses, so little were they able to\nlisten with equanimity to such accents. But the spirits of the flowers\nwere, at the time, silent and devoid of feeling, the birds were plunged\nin dreams and in a state of stupor, so why did they start? A stanza\nappositely assigns the reason:–",
        "  P’in Erh’s mental talents and looks must in the world be rare–.\n  Alone, clasped in a subtle smell, she quits her maiden room.\n  The sound of but one single sob scarcely dies away,\n  And drooping flowers cover the ground and birds fly in dismay.",
        "Lin Tai-yü was sobbing in her solitude, when a creaking noise struck her\near and the door of the court was flung open. Who came out, is not yet\nascertained; but, reader, should you wish to know, the next chapter will\nexplain.",
        "  In the Ti Ts’ui pavilion, Pao-ch’ai diverts herself with the\n      multi-coloured butterflies.\n  Over the mound, where the flowers had been interred, Tai-yü bewails\n      their withered bloom.",
        "Lin Tai-yü, we must explain in taking up the thread of our narrative,\nwas disconsolately bathed in tears, when her ear was suddenly attracted\nby the creak of the court gate, and her eyes by the appearance of\nPao-ch’ai beyond the threshold. Pao-yü, Hsi Jen and a whole posse of\ninmates then walked out. She felt inclined to go up to Pao-yü and ask\nhim a question; but dreading that if she made any inquiries in the\npresence of such a company, Pao-yü would be put to the blush and placed\nin an awkward position, she slipped aside and allowed Pao-ch’ai to\nprosecute her way. And it was only after Pao-yü and the rest of the\nparty had entered and closed the gate behind them that she at last\nissued from her retreat. Then fixing her gaze steadfastly on the\ngateway, she dropped a few tears. But inwardly conscious of their utter\nfutility she retraced her footsteps and wended her way back into her\napartment. And with heavy heart and despondent spirits, she divested\nherself of the remainder of her habiliments.",
        "Tzu Chüan and Hsüeh Yen were well aware, from the experience they had\nreaped in past days, that Lin Tai-yü was, in the absence of anything to\noccupy her mind, prone to sit and mope, and that if she did not frown\nher eyebrows, she anyway heaved deep sighs; but they were quite at a\nloss to divine why she was, with no rhyme or reason, ever so ready to\nindulge, to herself, in inexhaustible gushes of tears. At first, there\nwere such as still endeavoured to afford her solace; or who, suspecting\nlest she brooded over the memory of her father and mother, felt\nhome-sick, or aggrieved, through some offence given her, tried by every\npersuasion to console and cheer her; but, as contrary to all\nexpectations, she subsequently persisted time and again in this dull\nmood, through each succeeding month and year, people got accustomed to\nher eccentricities and did not extend to her the least sympathy. Hence\nit was that no one (on this occasion) troubled her mind about her, but\nletting her sit and sulk to her heart’s content, they one and all turned\nin and went to sleep.",
        "Lin Tai-yü leaned against the railing of the bed, clasping her knees\nwith both hands, her eyes suffused with tears. She looked, in very\ntruth, like a carved wooden image or one fashioned of mud. There she sat\nstraight up to the second watch, even later, when she eventually fell\nasleep.",
        "The whole night nothing remarkable transpired. The morrow was the 26th\nday of the fourth moon. Indeed on this day, at one p.m., commenced the\nseason of the ’Sprouting seeds,’ and, according to an old custom, on the\nday on which this feast of ’Sprouting seeds’ fell, every one had to lay\nall kinds of offerings and sacrificial viands on the altar of the god of\nflowers. Soon after the expiry of this season of ’Sprouting seeds’\nfollows summertide, and us plants in general then wither and the god of\nflowers resigns his throne, it is compulsory to feast him at some\nentertainment, previous to his departure.",
        "In the ladies’ apartments this custom was observed with still more\nrigour; and, for this reason, the various inmates Of the park of Broad\nVista had, without a single exception, got up at an early hour. The\nyoung people either twisted flowers and willow twigs in such a way as to\nrepresent chairs and horses, or made tufted banners with damask,\nbrocaded gauze and silk, and bound them with variegated threads. These\narticles of decoration were alike attached on every tree and plant; and\nthroughout the whole expanse of the park, embroidered sashes waved to\nand fro, and ornamented branches nodded their heads about. In addition\nto this, the members of the family were clad in such fineries that they\nput the peach tree to shame, made the almond yield the palm, the swallow\nenvious and the hawk to blush. We could not therefore exhaustively\ndescribe them within our limited space of time.",
        "Pao-ch’ai, Ying Ch’un, T’an Ch’un, Hsi Ch’un, Li Wan, lady Feng and\nother girls, as well as Ta Chieh Erh, Hsiang Ling and the waiting-maids\nwere, one and all, we will now notice, in the garden enjoying\nthemselves; the only person who could not be seen was Lin Tai-yü.",
        "“How is it,” consequently inquired Ying Ch’un, “that I don’t see cousin\nLiu? What a lazy girl! Is she forsooth fast asleep even at this late\nhour of the day?”",
        "“Wait all of you here,” rejoined Pao-ch’ai, “and I’ll go and shake her\nup and bring her.”",
        "With these words, she speedily left her companions and repaired\nstraightway into the Hsiao Hsiang lodge.",
        "While she was going on her errand, she met Wen Kuan and the rest of the\ngirls, twelve in all, on their way to seek the party. Drawing near, they\ninquired after her health. After exchanging a few commonplace remarks,\nPao-ch’ai turned round and pointing, said: “you will find them all in\nthere; you had better go and join them. As for me, I’m going to fetch\nMiss Lin, but I’ll be back soon.”",
        "Saying this, she followed the winding path, and came to the Hsiao Hsiang\nlodge. Upon suddenly raising her eyes, she saw Pao-yü walk in. Pao-ch’ai\nimmediately halted, and, lowering her head, she gave way to meditation\nfor a time. “Pao-yü and Lin Tai-yü,” she reflected, “have grown up\ntogether from their very infancy. But cousins, though they be, there are\nmany instances in which they cannot evade suspicion, for they joke\nwithout heeding propriety; and at one time they are friends and at\nanother at daggers drawn. Tai-yü has, moreover, always been full of\nenvy; and has ever displayed a peevish disposition, so were I to follow\nhim in at this juncture, why, Pao-yü would, in the first place, not feel\nat ease, and, in the second, Tai-yü would give way to jealousy. Better\ntherefore for me to turn back.”",
        "At the close of this train of thought, she retraced her steps. But just\nas she was starting to join her other cousins, she unexpectedly\ndescried, ahead of her, a pair of jade-coloured butterflies, of the size\nof a circular fan. Now they soared high, now they made a swoop down, in\ntheir flight against the breeze; much to her amusement.",
        "Pao-ch’ai felt a wish to catch them for mere fun’s sake, so producing a\nfan from inside her sleeve, she descended on to the turfed ground to\nflap them with it. The two butterflies suddenly were seen to rise;\nsuddenly to drop: sometimes to come; at others to go. Just as they were\non the point of flying across the stream to the other side, the\nenticement proved too much for Pao-ch’ai, and she pursued them on tiptoe\nstraight up to the Ti Ts’ui pavilion, nestling on the bank of the pond;\nwhile fragrant perspiration dripped drop by drop, and her sweet breath\npanted gently. But Pao-ch’ai abandoned the idea of catching them, and\nwas about to beat a retreat, when all at once she overheard, in the\npavilion, the chatter of people engaged in conversation.",
        "This pavilion had, it must be added, a verandah and zig-zag balustrades\nrunning all round. It was erected over the water, in the centre of a\npond, and had on the four sides window-frames of carved wood work, stuck\nwith paper. So when Pao-ch’ai caught, from without the pavilion, the\nsound of voices, she at once stood still and lent an attentive ear to\nwhat was being said.",
        "“Look at this handkerchief,” she overheard. “If it’s really the one\nyou’ve lost, well then keep it; but if it isn’t you must return it to\nMr. Yün.”",
        "“To be sure it is my own,” another party observed, “bring it along and\ngive it to me.”",
        "“What reward will you give me?” she further heard. “Is it likely that\nI’ve searched all for nothing!”",
        "“I’ve long ago promised to recompense you, and of course I won’t play\nyou false,” some one again rejoined.",
        "“I found it and brought it round,” also reached her ear, “and you\nnaturally will recompense me; but won’t you give anything to the person\nwho picked it up?”",
        "“Don’t talk nonsense,” the other party added, “he belongs to a family of\ngentlemen, and anything of ours he may pick up it’s his bounden duty to\nrestore to us. What reward could you have me give him?”",
        "“If you don’t reward him,” she heard some one continue, “what will I be\nable to tell him? Besides, he enjoined me time after time that if there\nwas to be no recompense, I was not to give it to you.”",
        "A short pause ensued. “Never mind!” then came out again to her, “take\nthis thing of mine and present it to him and have done! But do you mean\nto let the cat out of the bag with any one else? You should take some\noath.”",
        "“If I tell any one,” she likewise overheard, “may an ulcer grow on my\nmouth, and may I, in course of time, die an unnatural death!”",
        "“Ai-ya!” was the reply she heard; “our minds are merely bent upon\ntalking, but some one might come and quietly listen from outside;\nwouldn’t it be as well to push all the venetians open. Any one seeing us\nin here will then imagine that we are simply chatting about nonsense.\nBesides, should they approach, we shall be able to observe them, and at\nonce stop our conversation!”",
        "Pao-ch’ai listened to these words from outside, with a heart full of\nastonishment. “How can one wonder,” she argued mentally, “if all those\nlewd and dishonest people, who have lived from olden times to the\npresent, have devised such thorough artifices! But were they now to open\nand see me here, won’t they feel ashamed. Moreover, the voice in which\nthose remarks were uttered resembles very much that of Hung Erh,\nattached to Pao-yü’s rooms, who has all along shown a sharp eye and a\nshrewd mind. She’s an artful and perverse thing of the first class! And\nas I have now overheard her peccadilloes, and a person in despair rebels\nas sure as a dog in distress jumps over the wall, not only will trouble\narise, but I too shall derive no benefit. It would be better at present\ntherefore for me to lose no time in retiring. But as I fear I mayn’t be\nin time to get out of the way, the only alternative for me is to make\nuse of some art like that of the cicada, which can divest itself of its\nexuviae.”",
        "She had scarcely brought her reflections to a close before a sound of\n’ko-chih’ reached her ears. Pao-ch’ai purposely hastened to tread with\nheavy step. “P’in Erh, I see where you’re hiding!” she cried out\nlaughingly; and as she shouted, she pretended to be running ahead in\npursuit of her.",
        "As soon as Hsiao Hung and Chui Erh pushed the windows open from inside\nthe pavilion, they heard Pao-ch’ai screaming, while rushing forward; and\nboth fell into a state of trepidation from the fright they sustained.",
        "Pao-ch’ai turned round and faced them. “Where have you been hiding Miss\nLin?” she smiled.",
        "“Who has seen anything of Miss Lin,” retorted Chui Erh.",
        "“I was just now,” proceeded Pao-ch’ai, “on that side of the pool, and\ndiscerned Miss Lin squatting down over there and playing with the water.\nI meant to have gently given her a start, but scarcely had I walked up\nto her, when she saw me, and, with a detour towards the East, she\nat once vanished from sight. So mayn’t she be concealing herself in\nthere?”",
        "As she spoke, she designedly stepped in and searched about for her. This\nover, she betook herself away, adding: “she’s certain to have got again\ninto that cave in the hill, and come across a snake, which must have\nbitten her and put an end to her.”",
        "So saying, she distanced them, feeling again very much amused. “I have\nmanaged,” she thought, “to ward off this piece of business, but I wonder\nwhat those two think about it.”",
        "Hsiao Hung, who would have anticipated, readily credited as gospel the\nremarks she heard Pao-ch’ai make. But allowing just time enough to\nPao-ch’ai to got to a certain distance, she instantly drew Chui Erh to\nher. “Dreadful!” she observed, “Miss Lin was squatting in here and must\nfor a certainty have overheard what we said before she left.”",
        "Albeit Chui Erh listened to her words, she kept her own counsel for a\nlong time. “What’s to be done?” Hsiao Hung consequently exclaimed.",
        "“Even supposing she did overhear what we said,” rejoined Chui Erh by way\nof answer, “why should she meddle in what does not concern her? Every\none should mind her own business.”",
        "“Had it been Miss Pao, it would not have mattered,” remarked Hsiao Hung,\n\"but Miss Lin delights in telling mean things of people and is, besides,\nso petty-minded. Should she have heard and anything perchance comes to\nlight, what will we do?”",
        "During their colloquy, they noticed Wen Kuan, Hsiang Ling, Ssu Ch’i,\nShih Shu and the other girls enter the pavilion, so they were compelled\nto drop the conversation and to play and laugh with them. They then\nespied lady Feng standing on the top of the hillock, waving her hand,\nbeckoning to Hsiao Hung. Hurriedly therefore leaving the company, she\nran up to lady Feng and with smile heaped upon smile, “my lady,” she\ninquired, “what is it that you want?”",
        "Lady Feng scrutinised her for a time. Observing how spruce and pretty\nshe was in looks, and how genial in her speech, she felt prompted to\ngive her a smile. “My own waiting-maid,” she said, “hasn’t followed me\nin here to-day; and as I’ve just this moment bethought myself of\nsomething and would like to send some one on an errand, I wonder whether\nyou’re fit to undertake the charge and deliver a message faithfully.”",
        "“Don’t hesitate in entrusting me with any message you may have to send,\"\nreplied Hsiao Hung with a laugh. “I’ll readily go and deliver it. Should\nI not do so faithfully, and blunder in fulfilling your business, my\nlady, you may visit me with any punishment your ladyship may please, and\nI’ll have nothing to say.”",
        "“What young lady’s servant are you,” smiled lady Feng? “Tell me, so that\nwhen she comes back, after I’ve sent you out, and looks for you, I may\nbe able to tell her about you.”",
        "“I’m attached to our Master Secundus,’ Mr. Pao’s rooms,” answered Hsiao\nHung.",
        "“Ai-ya!” ejaculated lady Feng, as soon as she heard these words. “Are\nyou really in Pao-yü’s rooms! How strange! Yet it comes to the same\nthing. Well, if he asks for you, I’ll tell him where you are. Go now to\nour house and tell your sister P’ing that she’ll find on the table in\nthe outer apartment and under the stand with the plate from the Ju kiln,\na bundle of silver; that it contains the one hundred and twenty taels\nfor the embroiderers’ wages; and that when Chang Ts’ai’s wife comes, the\nmoney should be handed to her to take away, after having been weighed in\nher presence and been given to her to tally. Another thing too I want.\nIn the inner apartment and at the head of the bed you’ll find a small\npurse, bring it along to me.”",
        "Hsiao Hung listened to her orders and then started to carry them out. On\nher return, in a short while, she discovered that lady Feng was not on\nthe hillock. But perceiving Ssu Ch’i egress from the cave and stand\nstill to tie her petticoat, she walked up to her. “Sister, do you know\nwhere our lady Secunda is gone to?” she asked.",
        "“I didn’t notice,” rejoined Ssu Ch’i.",
        "At this reply, Hsiao Hung turned round and cast a glance on all four\nquarters. Seeing T’an Ch’un and Pao-ch’ai standing by the bank of the\npond on the opposite side and looking at the fish, Hsiao Hung advanced\nup to them. “Young ladies,” she said, straining a smile, “do you\nperchance have any idea where our lady Secunda is gone to now?”",
        "“Go into your senior lady’s court and look for her!” T’an Ch’un\nanswered.",
        "Hearing this, Hsiao Hung was proceeding immediately towards the Tao\nHsiang village, when she caught sight, just ahead of her, of Ch’ing Wen,\nCh’i Hsia, Pi Hen, Ch’iu Wen, She Yüeh, Shih Shu, Ju Hua, Ying Erh and\nsome other girls coming towards her in a group.",
        "The moment Ch’ing Wen saw Hsiao Hung, she called out to her. “Are you\ngone clean off your head?” she exclaimed. “You don’t water the flowers,\nnor feed the birds or prepare the tea stove, but gad about outside!”",
        "“Yesterday,” replied Hsiao Hung, “Mr. Secundus told me that there was no\nneed for me to water the flowers to-day; that it was enough if they were\nwatered every other day. As for the birds, you’re still in the arms of\nMorpheus, sister, when I give them their food.”",
        "“And what about the tea-stove?” interposed Pi Hen.",
        "“To-day,” retorted Hsiao Hung, “is not my turn on duty, so don’t ask me\nwhether there be any tea or not!”",
        "“Do you listen to that mouth of hers!” cried Ch’i Hsia, “but don’t you\ngirls speak to her; let her stroll about and have done!”",
        "“You’d better all go and ask whether I’ve been gadding about or not,\"\ncontinued Hsiao Hung. “Our lady Secunda has just bidden me go and\ndeliver a message, and fetch something.”",
        "Saying this, she raised the purse and let them see it; and they, finding\nthey could hit upon nothing more to taunt her with, trudged along\nonwards.",
        "Ch’ing Wen smiled a sarcastic smile. “How funny!” she cried. “Lo, she\nclimbs up a high branch and doesn’t condescend to look at any one of us!\nAll she told her must have been just some word or two, who knows! But is\nit likely that our lady has the least notion of her name or surname that\nshe rides such a high horse, and behaves in this manner! What credit is\nit in having been sent on a trifling errand like this! Will we, by and\nbye, pray, hear anything more about you? If you’ve got any gumption,\nyou’d better skedaddle out of this garden this very day. For, mind, it’s\nonly if you manage to hold your lofty perch for any length of time that\nyou can be thought something of!”",
        "As she derided her, she continued on her way.",
        "During this while, Hsiao Hung listened to her, but as she did not find\nit a suitable moment to retaliate, she felt constrained to suppress her\nresentment and go in search of lady Feng.",
        "On her arrival at widow Li’s quarters, she, in point of fact, discovered\nlady Feng seated inside with her having a chat. Hsiao Hung approached\nher and made her report. “Sister P’ing says,” she observed, “that as\nsoon as your ladyship left the house, she put the money by, and that\nwhen Chang Ts’ai’s wife went in a little time to fetch it, she had it\nweighed in her presence, after which she gave it to her to take away.”",
        "With these words, she produced the purse and presented it to her.\n\"Sister P’ing bade me come and tell your ladyship,” she added,\ncontinuing, “that Wang Erh came just now to crave your orders, as to who\nare the parties from whom he has to go and (collect interest on money\ndue) and sister P’ing explained to him what your wishes were and sent\nhim off.”",
        "“How could she tell him where I wanted him to go?” Lady Feng laughed.",
        "“Sister P’ing says,” Hsiao Hung proceeded, “that our lady presents her\ncompliments to your ladyship (widow Li) here-(_To lady Feng_) that\nour master Secundus has in fact not come home, and that albeit a delay\nof (a day) or two will take place (in the collection of the money), your\nladyship should, she begs, set your mind at ease. (_To Li Wan_).\nThat when lady Quinta is somewhat better, our lady will let lady Quinta\nknow and come along with her to see your ladyship. (_To lady\nFeng_). That lady Quinta sent a servant the day before yesterday to\ncome over and say that our lady, your worthy maternal aunt, had\ndespatched a letter to inquire after your ladyship’s health; that she\nalso wished to ask you, my lady, her worthy niece in here, for a couple\nof ’long-life-great-efficacy-full-of-every-virtue’ pills; and that if\nyou have any, they should, when our lady bids a servant come over, be\nsimply given her to bring to our lady here, and that any one bound\nto-morrow for that side could then deliver them on her way to her\nladyship, your aunt yonder, to take along with her.”",
        "“Ai-yo-yo!” exclaimed widow Li, before the close of the message. “It’s\nimpossible for me to make out what you’re driving at! What a heap of\nladyships and misters!”",
        "“It’s not to be wondered at that you can’t make them out,” interposed\nlady Feng laughing. “Why, her remarks refer to four or five distinct\nfamilies.”",
        "While speaking, she again faced Hsiao Hung. “My dear girl,” she smiled,\n\"what a trouble you’ve been put to! But you speak decently, and unlike\nthe others who keep on buzz-buzz-buzz, like mosquitoes! You’re not\naware, sister-in-law, that I actually dread uttering a word to any of\nthe girls outside the few servant-girls and matrons in my own immediate\nservice; for they invariably spin out, what could be condensed in a\nsingle phrase, into a long interminable yarn, and they munch and chew\ntheir words; and sticking to a peculiar drawl, they groan and moan; so\nmuch so, that they exasperate me till I fly into a regular rage. Yet how\nare they to know that our P’ing Erh too was once like them. But when I\nasked her: ’must you forsooth imitate the humming of a mosquito, in\norder to be accounted a handsome girl?’ and spoke to her, on several\r\noccasions, she at length improved considerably.”",
        "“What a good thing it would be,” laughed Li Kung-ts’ai, “if they could\nall be as smart as you are.”",
        "“This girl is first-rate!” rejoined lady Feng, “she just now delivered\ntwo messages. They didn’t, I admit, amount to much, yet to listen to\nher, she spoke to the point.”",
        "“To-morrow,” she continued, addressing herself to Hsiao Hung smilingly,\n\"come and wait on me, and I’ll acknowledge you as my daughter; and the\nmoment you come under my control, you’ll readily improve.”",
        "At this news, Hsiao Hung spurted out laughing aloud.",
        "“What are you laughing for?” Lady Feng inquired. “You must say to\nyourself that I am young in years and that how much older can I be than\nyourself to become your mother; but are you under the influence of a\nspring dream? Go and ask all those people older than yourself. They\nwould be only too ready to call me mother. But snapping my fingers at\nthem, I to-day exalt you.”",
        "“I wasn’t laughing about that,” Hsiao Hung answered with a smiling face.\n\"I was amused by the mistake your ladyship made about our generations.\nWhy, my mother claims to be your daughter, my lady, and are you now\ngoing to recognise me too as your daughter?”",
        "“Who’s your mother?” Lady Feng exclaimed.",
        "“Don’t you actually know her?” put in Li Kung-ts’ai with a smile. “She’s\nLin Chih-hsiao’s child.”",
        "This disclosure greatly surprised lady Feng. “What!” she consequently\ncried, “is she really his daughter?”",
        "“Why Lin Chih-hsiao and his wife,” she resumed smilingly, “couldn’t\neither of them utter a sound if even they were pricked with an awl.\nI’ve always maintained that they’re a well-suited couple; as the one is\nas deaf as a post, and the other as dumb as a mute. But who would ever\nhave expected them to have such a clever girl! By how much are you in\nyour teens?”",
        "“I’m seventeen,” replied Hsia Hung.",
        "“What is your name?” she went on to ask.",
        "“My name was once Hung Yü.” Hsiao Hung rejoined. “But as it was a\nduplicate of that of Master Secundus, Mr. Pao-yü, I’m now simply called\nHsiao Hung.”",
        "Upon hearing this explanation, lady Feng raised her eyebrows into a\nfrown, and turning her head round: “It’s most disgusting!” she remarked,\n\"Those bearing the name Yü would seem to be very cheap; for your name is\nYü, and so is also mine Yü. Sister-in-law,” she then observed; “I never\nlet you know anything about it, but I mentioned to her mother that Lai\nTa’s wife has at present her hands quite full, and that she hasn’t\neither any notion as to who is who in this mansion. ’You had better,’ (I\nsaid), ’carefully select a couple of girls for my service.’ She assented\nunreservedly, but she put it off and never chose any. On the contrary,\nshe sent this girl to some other place. But is it likely that she\nwouldn’t have been well off with me?”",
        "“Here you are again full of suspicion!” Li Wan laughed. “She came in\nhere long before you ever breathed a word to her! So how could you bear\na grudge against her mother?”",
        "“Well, in that case,” added lady Feng, “I’ll speak to Pao-yü to-morrow,\nand induce him to find another one, and to allow this girl to come along\nwith me. I wonder, however, whether she herself is willing or not?”",
        "“Whether willing or not,” interposed Hsiao Hung smiling, “such as we\ncouldn’t really presume to raise our voices and object. We should feel\nit our privilege to serve such a one as your ladyship, and learn a\nlittle how to discriminate when people raise or drop their eyebrows and\neyes (with pleasure or displeasure), and reap as well some experience in\nsuch matters as go out or come in, whether high or low, great and\nsmall.”",
        "But during her reply, she perceived Madame Wang’s waiting-maid come and\ninvite lady Feng to go over. Lady Feng bade good-bye at once to Li\nKung-ts’ai and took her departure.",
        "Hsiao Hung then returned into the I Hung court, where we will leave her\nand devote our attention for the present to Lin Tai-yü.",
        "As she had had but little sleep in the night, she got up the next day at\na late hour. When she heard that all her cousins were collected in the\npark, giving a farewell entertainment for the god of flowers, she\nhastened, for fear people should laugh at her for being lazy, to comb\nher hair, perform her ablutions, and go out and join them. As soon as\nshe reached the interior of the court, she caught sight of Pao-yü,\nentering the door, who speedily greeted her with a smile. “My dear\ncousin,” he said, “did you lodge a complaint against me yesterday? I’ve\nbeen on pins and needles the whole night long.”",
        "Tai-yü forthwith turned her head away. “Put the room in order,” she\nshouted to Tzu Chüan, “and lower one of the gauze window-frames. And\nwhen you’ve seen the swallows come back, drop the curtain; keep it down\nthen by placing the lion on it, and after you have burnt the incense,\nmind you cover the censer.”",
        "So saying she stepped outside.",
        "Pao-yü perceiving her manner, concluded again that it must be on account\nof the incident of the previous noon, but how could he have had any idea\nabout what had happened in the evening? He kept on still bowing and\ncurtseying; but Lin Tai-yü did not even so much as look at him straight\nin the face, but egressing alone out of the door of the court, she\nproceeded there and then in search of the other girls.",
        "Pao-yü fell into a despondent mood and gave way to conjectures.",
        "“Judging,” he reflected, “from this behaviour of hers, it would seem as\nif it could not be for what transpired yesterday. Yesterday too I came\nback late in the evening, and, what’s more, I didn’t see her, so that\nthere was no occasion on which I could have given her offence.”",
        "As he indulged in these reflections, he involuntarily followed in her\nfootsteps to try and catch her up, when he descried Pao-ch’ai and\nT’an-ch’un on the opposite side watching the frolics of the storks.",
        "As soon as they saw Tai-yü approach, the trio stood together and started\na friendly chat. But noticing Pao-yü also come up, T’an Ch’un smiled.\n\"Brother Pao,” she said, “are you all right. It’s just three days that I\nhaven’t seen anything of you?”",
        "“Are you sister quite well?” Pao-yü rejoined, a smile on his lips. “The\nother day, I asked news of you of our senior sister-in-law.”",
        "“Brother Pao,” T’an Ch’un remarked, “come over here; I want to tell you\nsomething.”",
        "The moment Pao-yü heard this, he quickly went with her. Distancing\nPao-ch’ai and Tai-yü, the two of them came under a pomegranate tree.\n\"Has father sent for you these last few days?” T’an Ch’un then asked.",
        "“He hasn’t,” Pao-yü answered laughingly by way of reply.",
        "“Yesterday,” proceeded T’an Ch’un, “I heard vaguely something or other\nabout father sending for you to go out.”",
        "“I presume,” Pao-yü smiled, “that some one must have heard wrong, for he\nnever sent for me.”",
        "“I’ve again managed to save during the last few months,” added T’an\nCh’un with another smile, “fully ten tiaos, so take them and bring me,\nwhen at any time you stroll out of doors, either some fine writings or\nsome ingenious knicknack.”",
        "“Much as I have roamed inside and outside the city walls,” answered\nPao-yü, “and seen grand establishments and large temples, I’ve never\ncome across anything novel or pretty. One simply sees articles made of\ngold, jade, copper and porcelain, as well as such curios for which we\ncould find no place here. Besides these, there are satins, eatables, and\nwearing apparel.”",
        "“Who cares for such baubles!” exclaimed T’an Ch’un. “How could they come\nup to what you purchased the last time; that wee basket, made of willow\ntwigs, that scent-box, scooped out of a root of real bamboo, that\nportable stove fashioned of glutinous clay; these things were, oh, so\nvery nice! I was as fond of them as I don’t know what; but, who’d have\nthought it, they fell in love with them and bundled them all off, just\nas if they were precious things.”",
        "“Is it things of this kind that you really want?” laughed Pao-yü. “Why,\nthese are worth nothing! Were you to take a hundred cash and give them\nto the servant-boys, they could, I’m sure, bring two cart-loads of\nthem.”",
        "“What do the servant-boys know?” T’an Ch’un replied. “Those you chose\nfor me were plain yet not commonplace. Neither were they of coarse make.\nSo were you to procure me as many as you can get of them, I’ll work you\na pair of slippers like those I gave you last time, and spend twice as\nmuch trouble over them as I did over that pair you have. Now, what do\nyou say to this bargain?”",
        "“Your reference to this,” smiled Pao-yü, “reminds me of an old incident.\nOne day I had them on, and by a strange coincidence, I met father, whose\nfancy they did not take, and he inquired who had worked them. But how\ncould I muster up courage to allude to the three words: my sister\nTertia, so I answered that my maternal aunt had given them to me on the\nrecent occasion of my birthday. When father heard that they had been\ngiven to me by my aunt, he could not very well say anything. But after a\nwhile, ’why uselessly waste,’ he observed, ’human labour, and throw away\nsilks to make things of this sort!’ On my return, I told Hsi Jen about\nit. ’Never mind,’ said Hsi Jen; but Mrs. Chao got angry. ’Her own\nbrother,’ she murmured indignantly, ’wears slipshod shoes and socks in\nholes, and there’s no one to look after him, and does she go and work\nall these things!’”",
        "T’an Ch’un, hearing this, immediately lowered her face. “Now tell me,\naren’t these words utter rot!” she shouted. “What am I that I have to\nmake shoes? And is it likely that Huan Erh hasn’t his own share of\nthings! Clothes are clothes, and shoes and socks are shoes and socks;\nand how is it that any grudges arise in the room of a mere servant-girl\nand old matron? For whose benefit does she come out with all these\nthings! I simply work a pair or part of a pair when I am at leisure,\nwith time on my hands. And I can give them to any brother, elder or\nyounger, I fancy; and who has a right to interfere with me? This is just\nanother bit of blind anger!”",
        "After listening to her, Pao-yü nodded his head and smiled. “Yet,” he\nsaid, “you don’t know what her motives may be. It’s but natural that she\nshould also cherish some expectations.”",
        "This apology incensed T’an Ch’un more than ever, and twisting her head\nround, “Even you have grown dull!” she cried. “She does, of course,\nindulge in expectations, but they are actuated by some underhand and\npaltry notion! She may go on giving way to these ideas, but I, for my\npart, will only care for Mr. Chia Cheng and Madame Wang. I won’t care a\nrap for any one else. In fact, I’ll be nice with such of my sisters and\nbrothers, as are nice to me; and won’t even draw any distinction between\nthose born of primary wives and those of secondary ones. Properly\nspeaking, I shouldn’t say these things about her, but she’s\nnarrow-minded to a degree, and unlike what she should be. There’s\nbesides another ridiculous thing. This took place the last time I gave\nyou the money to get me those trifles. Well, two days after that, she\nsaw me, and she began again to represent that she had no money and that\nshe was hard up. Nevertheless, I did not worry my brain with her goings\non. But as it happened, the servant-girls subsequently quitted the room,\nand she at once started finding fault with me. ’Why,’ she asked, ’do I\ngive you my savings to spend and don’t, after all, let Huan Erh have\nthem and enjoy them?’ When I heard these reproaches, I felt both\ninclined to laugh, and also disposed to lose my temper; but I there and\nthen skedaddled out of her quarters, and went over to our Madame Wang.”",
        "As she was recounting this incident, “Well,” she overheard Pao-ch’ai\nsarcastically observe from the opposite direction, “have you done\nspinning your yarns? If you have, come along! It’s quite evident that\nyou are brother and sister, for here you leave every one else and go and\ndiscuss your own private matters. Couldn’t we too listen to a single\nsentence of what you have to say?”",
        "While she taunted them, T’an Ch’un and Pao-yü eventually drew near her\nwith smiling faces.",
        "Pao-yü, however, failed to see Lin Tai-yü and he concluded that she had\ndodged out of the way and gone elsewhere. “It would be better,” he\nmuttered, after some thought, “that I should let two days elapse, and\ngive her temper time to evaporate before I go to her.” But as he drooped\nhis head, his eye was attracted by a heap of touch-me-nots, pomegranate\nblossom and various kinds of fallen flowers, which covered the ground\nthick as tapestry, and he heaved a sigh. “It’s because,” he pondered,\n\"she’s angry that she did not remove these flowers; but I’ll take them\nover to the place, and by and bye ask her about them.”",
        "As he argued to himself, he heard Pao-ch’ai bid them go out. “I’ll join\nyou in a moment,” Pao-yü replied; and waiting till his two cousins had\ngone some distance, he bundled the flowers into his coat, and ascending\nthe hill, he crossed the stream, penetrated into the arbour, passed\nthrough the avenues with flowers and wended his way straight for the\nspot, where he had, on a previous occasion, interred the peach-blossoms\nwith the assistance of Lin Tai-yü. But scarcely had he reached the mound\ncontaining the flowers, and before he had, as yet, rounded the brow of\nthe hill, than he caught, emanating from the off side, the sound of some\none sobbing, who while giving way to invective, wept in a most\nheart-rending way.",
        "“I wonder,” soliloquised Pao-yü, “whose servant-girl this is, who has\nbeen so aggrieved as to run over here to have a good cry!”",
        "While speculating within himself, he halted. He then heard, mingled with\nwails:–",
        "  Flowers wither and decay; and flowers do fleet; they fly all o’er the\n      skies;\n  Their bloom wanes; their smell dies; but who is there with them to\n      sympathise?\n  While vagrant gossamer soft doth on fluttering spring-bowers bind its\n      coils,\n  And drooping catkins lightly strike and cling on the embroidered\n      screens,\n  A maiden in the inner rooms, I sore deplore the close of spring.\n  Such ceaseless sorrow fills my breast, that solace nowhere can I find.\n  Past the embroidered screen I issue forth, taking with me a hoe,\n  And on the faded flowers to tread I needs must, as I come and go.\n  The willow fibres and elm seeds have each a fragrance of their own.\n  What care I, peach blossoms may fall, pear flowers away be blown;\n  Yet peach and pear will, when next year returns, burst out again in\n      bloom,\n  But can it e’er be told who will next year dwell in the inner room?\n  What time the third moon comes, the scented nests have been already\n      built.\n  And on the beams the swallows perch, excessive spiritless and staid;\n  Next year, when the flowers bud, they may, it’s true, have ample to\n      feed on:\n  But they know not that when I’m gone beams will be vacant and nests\n      fall!\n  In a whole year, which doth consist of three hundred and sixty days,\n  Winds sharp as swords and frost like unto spears each other rigorous\n      press,\n  So that how long can last their beauty bright; their fresh charm how\n      long stays?\n  Sudden they droop and fly; and whither they have flown, ’tis hard to\n      guess.\n  Flowers, while in bloom, easy the eye attract; but, when they wither,\n      hard they are to find.\n  Now by the footsteps, I bury the flowers, but sorrow will slay me.\n  Alone I stand, and as I clutch the hoe, silent tears trickle down,\n  And drip on the bare twigs, leaving behind them the traces of blood.\n  The goatsucker hath sung his song, the shades lower of eventide,\n  So with the lotus hoe I return home and shut the double doors.\n  Upon the wall the green lamp sheds its rays just as I go to sleep.\n  The cover is yet cold; against the window patters the bleak rain.\n  How strange! Why can it ever be that I feel so wounded at heart!\n  Partly, because spring I regret; partly, because with spring I’m\n      vexed!\n  Regret for spring, because it sudden comes; vexed, for it sudden goes.\n  For without warning, lo! it comes; and without asking it doth fleet.\n  Yesterday night, outside the hall sorrowful songs burst from my mouth,\n  For I found out that flowers decay, and that birds also pass away.\n  The soul of flowers, and the spirit of birds are both hard to\n      restrain.\n  Birds, to themselves when left, in silence plunge; and flowers, alone,\n      they blush.\n  Oh! would that on my sides a pair of wings could grow,\n  That to the end of heaven I may fly in the wake of flowers!\n  Yea to the very end of heaven,\n  Where I could find a fragrant grave!\n  For better, is it not, that an embroidered bag should hold my\n      well-shaped bones,\n  And that a heap of stainless earth should in its folds my winsome\n      charms enshroud.\n  For spotless once my frame did come, and spotless again it will go!\n  Far better than that I, like filthy mire, should sink into some drain!\n  Ye flowers are now faded and gone, and, lo, I come to bury you.\n  But as for me, what day I shall see death is not as yet divined!\n  Here I am fain these flowers to inter; but humankind will laugh me as\n      a fool.\n  Who knows, who will, in years to come, commit me to my grave!\n  Mark, and you’ll find the close of spring, and the gradual decay of\n      flowers,\n  Resemble faithfully the time of death of maidens ripe in years!\n  In a twinkle, spring time draws to a close, and maidens wax in age.\n  Flowers fade and maidens die; and of either nought any more is known.",
        "After listening to these effusions, Pao-yü unconsciously threw himself\ndown in a wandering frame of mind.",
        "But, reader, do you feel any interest in him? If you do, the subsequent\nchapter contains further details about him.",
        "  Chiang Yü-han lovingly presents a rubia-scented silk sash.\n  Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai blushingly covers her musk-perfumed string of red\n      beads.",
        "Lin Tai-yü, the story goes, dwelt, after Ch’ing Wen’s refusal, the\nprevious night, to open the door, under the impression that the blame\nlay with Pao-yü. The following day, which by another remarkable\ncoincidence, happened to correspond with the season, when the god of\nflowers had to be feasted, her total ignorance of the true\ncircumstances, and her resentment, as yet unspent, aroused again in her\ndespondent thoughts, suggested by the decline of spring time. She\nconsequently gathered a quantity of faded flowers and fallen petals, and\nwent and interred them. Unable to check the emotion, caused by the decay\nof the flowers, she spontaneously recited, after giving way to several\nloud lamentations, those verses which Pao-yü, she little thought,\noverheard from his position on the mound. At first, he did no more than\nnod his head and heave sighs, full of feeling. But when subsequently his\near caught:",
        "  “Here I am fain these flowers to inter, but humankind will laugh me as\n      a fool;\n  Who knows who will, in years to come, commit me to my grave!\n  In a twinkle springtime draws to an end, and maidens wax in age.\n  Flowers fade and maidens die; and of either naught any more is known.”",
        "he unconsciously was so overpowered with grief that he threw himself on\nthe mound, bestrewing the whole ground with the fallen flowers he\ncarried in his coat, close to his chest. “When Tai-yü’s flowerlike\ncharms and moon-like beauty,” he reflected, “by and bye likewise reach a\ntime when they will vanish beyond any hope of recovery, won’t my heart\nbe lacerated and my feelings be mangled! And extending, since Tai-yü\nmust at length some day revert to a state when it will be difficult to\nfind her, this reasoning to other persons, like Pao-ch’ai, Hsiang Ling,\nHsi Jen and the other girls, they too are equally liable to attain a\nstate beyond the reach of human search. But when Pao-ch’ai and all the\nrest have ultimately reached that stage when no trace will be visible of\nthem, where shall I myself be then? And when my own human form will have\nvanished and gone, whither I know not yet, to what person, I wonder,\nwill this place, this garden and these plants, revert?”",
        "From one to a second, and from a second to a third, he thus pursued his\nreflections, backwards and forwards, until he really did not know how he\ncould best, at this time and at such a juncture, dispel his fit of\nanguish. His state is adequately described by:",
        "  The shadow of a flower cannot err from the flower itself to the left\n      or the right.\n  The song of birds can only penetrate into the ear from the east or the\n      west.",
        "Lin Tai-yü was herself a prey to emotion and agitation, when unawares\nsorrowful accents also struck her ear, from the direction of the mound.\n\"Every one,” she cogitated, “laughs at me for labouring under a foolish\nmania, but is there likely another fool besides myself?” She then raised\nher head, and, casting a glance about her, she discovered that it was\nPao-yü. “Ts’ui!” eagerly cried Tai-yü, “I was wondering who it was; but\nis it truly this ruthless-hearted and short-lived fellow!”",
        "But the moment the two words “short-lived” dropped from her mouth, she\nsealed her lips; and, heaving a deep sigh, she turned herself round and\nhurriedly walked off.",
        "Pao-yü, meanwhile, remained for a time a prey to melancholy. But\nperceiving that Tai-yü had retired, he at once realised that she must\nhave caught sight of him and got out of his way; and, as his own company\nafforded him no pleasure, he shook the dust off his clothes, rose to his\nfeet and descending the hill, he started for the I Hung court by the\npath by which he had come. But he espied Tai-yü walking in advance of\nhim, and with rapid stride, he overtook her. “Stop a little!” he cried.\n\"I know you don’t care a rap for me; but I’ll just make one single\nremark, and from this day forward we’ll part company.”",
        "Tai-yü looked round. Observing that it was Pao-yü, she was about to\nignore him; hearing him however mention that he had only one thing to\nsay, “Please tell me what it is,” she forthwith rejoined.",
        "Pao-yü smiled at her. “If I pass two remarks will you listen to me; yes\nor no?” he asked.",
        "At these words, Tai-yü twisted herself round and beat a retreat. Pao-yü\nhowever followed behind.",
        "“Since this is what we’ve come to now,” he sighed, “what was the use of\nwhat existed between us in days gone by?”",
        "As soon as Tai-yü heard his exclamation, she stopped short impulsively.\nTurning her face towards him, “what about days gone by,” she remarked,\n\"and what about now?”",
        "“Ai!” ejaculated Pao-yü, “when you got here in days gone by, wasn’t I\nyour playmate in all your romps and in all your fun? My heart may have\nbeen set upon anything, but if you wanted it you could take it away at\nonce. I may have been fond of any eatable, but if I came to learn that\nyou too fancied it, I there and then put away what could be put away, in\na clean place, to wait, Miss, for your return. We had our meals at one\ntable; we slept in one and the same bed; whatever the servant-girls\ncould not remember, I reminded them of, for fear lest your temper, Miss,\nshould get ruffled. I flattered myself that cousins, who have grown up\ntogether from their infancy, as you and I have, would have continued,\nthrough intimacy or friendship, either would have done, in peace and\nharmony until the end, so as to make it palpable that we are above the\nrest. But, contrary to all my expectations, now that you, Miss, have\ndeveloped in body as well as in mind, you don’t take the least heed of\nme. You lay hold instead of some cousin Pao or cousin Feng or other from\nhere, there and everywhere and give them a place in your affections;\nwhile on the contrary you disregard me for three days at a stretch and\ndecline to see anything of me for four! I have besides no brother or\nsister of the same mother as myself. It’s true there are a couple of\nthem, but these, are you not forsooth aware, are by another mother! You\nand I are only children, so I ventured to hope that you would have\nreciprocated my feelings. But, who’d have thought it, I’ve simply thrown\naway this heart of mine, and here I am with plenty of woes to bear, but\nwith nowhere to go and utter them!”",
        "While expressing these sentiments, tears, unexpectedly, trickled from\nhis eyes.",
        "When Lin Tai-yü caught, with her ears, his protestations, and noticed\nwith her eyes his state of mind, she unconsciously experienced an inward\npang, and, much against her will, tears too besprinkled her cheeks; so,\ndrooping her head, she kept silent.",
        "Her manner did not escape Pao-yü’s notice. “I myself am aware,” he\nspeedily resumed, “that I’m worth nothing now; but, however imperfect I\nmay be, I could on no account presume to become guilty of any\nshortcoming with you cousin. Were I to ever commit the slightest fault,\nyour task should be either to tender me advice and warn me not to do it\nagain, or to blow me up a little, or give me a few whacks; and all this\nreproof I wouldn’t take amiss. But no one would have ever anticipated\nthat you wouldn’t bother your head in the least about me, and that you\nwould be the means of driving me to my wits’ ends, and so much out of my\nmind and off my head, as to be quite at a loss how to act for the best.\nIn fact, were death to come upon me, I would be a spirit driven to my\ngrave by grievances. However much exalted bonzes and eminent Taoist\npriests might do penance, they wouldn’t succeed in releasing my soul\nfrom suffering; for it would still be needful for you to clearly explain\nthe facts, so that I might at last be able to come to life.”",
        "After lending him a patient ear, Tai-yü suddenly banished from her\nmemory all recollection of the occurrences of the previous night. “Well,\nin that case,” she said, “why did you not let a servant-girl open the\ndoor when I came over?”",
        "This question took Pao-yü by surprise. “What prompts you to say this?\"\nhe exclaimed. “If I have done anything of the kind, may I die at once.”",
        "“Psha!” cried Tai-yü, “it’s not right that you-should recklessly broach\nthe subject of living or dying at this early morn! If you say yea, it’s\nyea; and nay, it’s nay; what use is there to utter such oaths!”",
        "“I didn’t really see you come over,” protested Pao-yü. “Cousin Pao-ch’ai\nit was, who came and sat for a while and then left.”",
        "After some reflection, Lin Tai-yü smiled. “Yes,” she observed, “your\nservant-girls must, I fancy, have been too lazy to budge, grumpy and in\na cross-grained mood; this is probable enough.”",
        "“This is, I feel sure, the reason,” answered Pao-yü, “so when I go back,\nI’ll find out who it was, call them to task and put things right.”",
        "“Those girls of yours;” continued Tai-yü, “should be given a lesson, but\nproperly speaking it isn’t for me to mention anything about it. Their\npresent insult to me is a mere trifle; but were to-morrow some Miss Pao\n(precious) or some Miss Pei (jewel) or other to come, and were she to be\nsubjected to insult, won’t it be a grave matter?”",
        "While she taunted him, she pressed her lips, and laughed sarcastically.",
        "Pao-yü heard her remarks and felt both disposed to gnash his teeth with\nrage, and to treat them as a joke; but in the midst of their colloquy,\nthey perceived a waiting-maid approach and invite them to have their\nmeal.",
        "Presently, the whole body of inmates crossed over to the front.",
        "“Miss,” inquired Madame Wang at the sight of Tai-yü, “have you taken any\nof Dr. Pao’s medicines? Do you feel any better?”",
        "“I simply feel so-so,” replied Lin Tai-yü, “but grandmother Chia\nrecommended me to go on taking Dr. Wang’s medicines.”",
        "“Mother,” Pao-yü interposed, “you’ve no idea that cousin Lin’s is an\ninternal derangement; it’s because she was born with a delicate physique\nthat she can’t stand the slightest cold. All she need do is to take a\ncouple of closes of some decoction to dispel the chill; yet it’s\npreferable that she should have medicine in pills.”",
        "“The other day,” said Madame Wang, “the doctor mentioned the name of\nsome pills, but I’ve forgotten what it is.”",
        "“I know something about pills,” put in Pao-yü; “he merely told her to\ntake some pills or other called ’ginseng as-a-restorative-of-the-system.’”",
        "“That isn’t it,” Madame Wang demurred.",
        "“The ’Eight-precious-wholesome-to-mother’ pills,” Pao-yü proceeded, “or\nthe ’Left-angelica’ or ’Right-angelica;’ if these also aren’t the ones,\nthey must be the ’Eight-flavour Rehmannia-glutinosa’ pills.”",
        "“None of these,” rejoined Madame Wang, “for I remember well that there\nwere the two words chin kang (guardians in Buddhistic temples).”",
        "“I’ve never before,” observed Pao-yü, clapping his hands, “heard of the\nexistence of chin kang pills; but in the event of there being any chin\nkang pills, there must, for a certainty, be such a thing as P’u Sa\n(Buddha) powder.”",
        "At this joke, every one in the whole room burst out laughing. Pao-ch’ai\ncompressed her lips and gave a smile. “It must, I’m inclined to think,\"\nshe suggested, “be the ’lord-of-heaven-strengthen-the-heart’ pills!”",
        "“Yes, that’s the name,” Madame Wang laughed, “why, now, I too have\nbecome muddle-headed.”",
        "“You’re not muddle-headed, mother,” said Pao-yü, “it’s the mention of\nChin kangs and Buddhas which confused you.”",
        "“Stuff and nonsense!” ejaculated Madame Wang. “What you want again is\nyour father to whip you!”",
        "“My father,” Pao-yü laughed, “wouldn’t whip me for a thing like this.”",
        "“Well, this being their name,” resumed Madame Wang, “you had better tell\nsome one to-morrow to buy you a few.”",
        "“All these drugs,” expostulated Pao-yü, “are of no earthly use. Were\nyou, mother, to give me three hundred and sixty taels, I’ll concoct a\nsupply of pills for my cousin, which I can certify will make her feel\nquite herself again before she has finished a single supply.”",
        "“What trash!” cried Madame Wang. “What kind of medicine is there so\ncostly!”",
        "“It’s a positive fact,” smiled Pao-yü. “This prescription of mine is\nunlike all others. Besides, the very names of those drugs are quaint,\nand couldn’t be enumerated in a moment; suffice it to mention the\nplacenta of the first child; three hundred and sixty ginseng roots,\nshaped like human beings and studded with leaves; four fat tortoises;\nfull-grown polygonum multiflorum; the core of the Pachyma cocos, found\non the roots of a fir tree of a thousand years old; and other such\nspecies of medicines. They’re not, I admit, out-of-the-way things; but\nthey are the most excellent among that whole crowd of medicines; and\nwere I to begin to give you a list of them, why, they’d take you all\nquite aback. The year before last, I at length let Hsüeh P’an have this\nrecipe, after he had made ever so many entreaties during one or two\nyears. When, however, he got the prescription, he had to search for\nanother two or three years and to spend over and above a thousand taels\nbefore he succeeded in having it prepared. If you don’t believe me,\nmother, you are at liberty to ask cousin Pao-ch’ai about it.”",
        "At the mention of her name, Pao-ch’ai laughingly waved her hand. “I know\nnothing about it,” she observed. “Nor have I heard anything about it, so\ndon’t tell your mother to ask me any questions.”",
        "“Really,” said Madame Wang smiling, “Pao-ch’ai is a good girl; she does\nnot tell lies.”",
        "Pao-yü was standing in the centre of the room. Upon hearing these words,\nhe turned round sharply and clapped his hands. “What I stated just now,\"\nhe explained, “was the truth; yet you maintain that it was all lies.”",
        "As he defended himself, he casually looked round, and caught sight of\nLin Tai-yü at the back of Pao-ch’ai laughing with tight-set lips, and\napplying her fingers to her face to put him to shame.",
        "But Lady Feng, who had been in the inner rooms overseeing the servants\nlaying the table, came out at once, as soon as she overheard the\nconversation. “Brother Pao tells no lies,” she smilingly chimed in,\n\"this is really a fact. Some time ago cousin Hsüeh P’an came over in\nperson and asked me for pearls, and when I inquired of him what he\nwanted them for, he explained that they were intended to compound some\nmedicine with; adding, in an aggrieved way, that it would have been\nbetter hadn’t he taken it in hand for he never had any idea that it\nwould involve such a lot of trouble! When I questioned him what the\nmedicine was, he returned for answer that it was a prescription of\nbrother Pao’s; and he mentioned ever so many ingredients, which I don’t\neven remember. ’Under other circumstances,’ he went on to say, ’I would\nhave purchased a few pearls, but what are absolutely wanted are such\npearls as have been worn on the head; and that’s why I come to ask you,\ncousin, for some. If, cousin, you’ve got no broken ornaments at hand, in\nthe shape of flowers, why, those that you have on your head will do as\nwell; and by and bye I’ll choose a few good ones and give them to you,\nto wear.’ I had no other course therefore than to snap a couple of twigs\nfrom some flowers I have, made of pearls, and to let him take them away.\nOne also requires a piece of deep red gauze, three feet in length of the\nbest quality; and the pearls must be triturated to powder in a mortar.”",
        "After each sentence expressed by lady Feng, Pao-yü muttered an\ninvocation to Buddha. “The thing is as clear as sunlight now,” he\nremarked.",
        "The moment lady Feng had done speaking, Pao-yü put in his word.\n\"Mother,” he added, “you should know that this is a mere makeshift, for\nreally, according to the letter of the prescription, these pearls and\nprecious stones should, properly speaking, consist of such as had been\nobtained from, some old grave and been worn as head-ornaments by some\nwealthy and honourable person of bygone days. But how could one go now\non this account and dig up graves, and open tombs! Hence it is that such\nas are simply in use among living persons can equally well be\nsubstituted.”",
        "“O-mi-to-fu!” exclaimed Madame Wang, after listening to him throughout.\n\"That will never do, and what an arduous job to uselessly saddle one’s\nself with; for even though there be interred in some graves people,\nwho’ve been dead for several hundreds of years, it wouldn’t be a\npropitious thing were their corpses turned topsy-turvey now and the\nbones abstracted; just for the sake of preparing some medicine or\nother.”",
        "Pao-yü thereupon addressed himself to Tai-yü. “Have you heard what was\nsaid or not?” he asked. “And is there, pray, any likelihood that cousin\nSecunda would also follow in my lead and tell lies?”",
        "While saying this, his eyes were, albeit his face was turned towards Lin\nTai-yü, fixed upon Pao-ch’ai.",
        "Lin Tai-yü pulled Madame Wang. “You just listen to him, aunt,” she\nobserved. “All because cousin Pao-ch’ai would not accommodate him by\nlying, he appeals to me.”",
        "“Pao-yü has a great knack,” Madame Wang said, “of dealing contemptuously\nwith you, his cousin.”",
        "“Mother,” Pao-yü smilingly protested, “you are not aware how the case\nstands. When cousin Pao-ch’ai lived at home, she knew nothing whatever\nabout my elder cousin Hsüeh P’an’s affairs, and how much less now that\nshe has taken up her quarters inside the garden? She, of course, knows\nless than ever about them! Yet, cousin Lin just now stealthily treated\nmy statements as lies, and put me to the blush.”",
        "These words were still on his lips, when they perceived a waiting-maid,\nfrom dowager lady Chia’s apartments, come in quest of Pao-yü and Lin\nTai-yü to go and have their meal. Lin Tai-yü, however, did not even call\nPao-yü, but forthwith rising to her feet, she went along, dragging the\nwaiting-maid by the hand.",
        "“Let’s wait for master Secundus, Mr. Pao, to go along with us,” demurred\nthe girl.",
        "“He doesn’t want anything to eat,” Lin Tai-yü replied; “he won’t come\nwith us, so I’ll go ahead.” So saying she promptly left the room.",
        "“I’ll have my repast with my mother to-day,” Pao-yü said.",
        "“Not at all,” Madame Wang remarked, “not at all. I’m going to fast\nto-day, so it’s only right and proper that you should go and have your\nown.”",
        "“I’ll also fast with you then,” Pao-yü retorted.",
        "As he spoke, he called out to the servant to go back, and rushing up to\nthe table, he took a seat.",
        "Madame Wang faced Pao-ch’ai and her companions. “You, girls,” she\nobserved, “had better have your meal, and let him have his own way!”",
        "“It’s only right that you should go,” Pao-ch’ai smiled. “Whether you\nhave anything to eat or not, you should go over for a while to keep\ncompany to cousin Lin, as she will be quite distressed and out of\nspirits.”",
        "“Who cares about her!” Pao-yü rejoined, “she’ll get all right again\nafter a time.”",
        "Shortly, they finished their repast. But Pao-yü apprehended, in the\nfirst place, that his grandmother Chia, would be solicitous on his\naccount, and longed, in the second, to be with Lin Tai-yü, so he\nhurriedly asked for some tea to rinse his mouth with.",
        "“Cousin Secundus,” T’an Ch’un and Hsi Ch’un interposed with an ironic\nlaugh, “what’s the use of the hurry-scurry you’re in the whole day long!\nEven when you’re having your meals, or your tea, you’re in this sort of\nfussy helter-skelter!”",
        "“Make him hurry up and have his tea,” Pao-ch’ai chimed in smiling, “so\nthat he may go and look up his cousin Lin. He’ll be up to all kinds of\nmischief if you keep him here!”",
        "Pao-yü drank his tea. Then hastily leaving the apartment, he proceeded\nstraightway towards the eastern court. As luck would have it, the moment\nhe got near lady Feng’s court, he descried lady Feng standing at the\ngateway. While standing on the step, and picking her teeth with an\near-cleaner, she superintended about ten young servant-boys removing the\nflower-pots from place to place. As soon as she caught sight of Pao-yü\napproaching, she put on a smiling face. “You come quite opportunely,\"\nshe said; “walk in, walk in, and write a few characters for me.”",
        "Pao-yü had no option but to follow her in. When they reached the\ninterior of her rooms, lady Feng gave orders to a servant to fetch a\npen, inkslab and paper.",
        "“Forty rolls of deep red ornamented satin,” she began, addressing\nherself to Pao-yü, “forty rolls of satin with dragons; a hundred rolls\nof gauzes of every colour, of the finest quality; four gold\nnecklaces....”",
        "“What’s this?” Pao-yü shouted, “it is neither a bill; nor is it a list\nof presents, and in what style shall I write it?”",
        "Lady Feng remonstrated with him. “Just you go on writing,” she said,\n\"for, in fact, as long as I can make out what it means, it’s all that is\nneeded.\"\n\r\nPao-yü at this response felt constrained to proceed with the writing.",
        "This over lady Feng put the paper by. As she did so, “I’ve still\nsomething more to tell you,” she smilingly pursued, “but I wonder\nwhether you will accede to it or not. There is in your rooms a\nservant-maid, Hsiao Hung by name, whom I would like to bring over into\nmy service, and I’ll select several girls to-morrow to wait on you; will\nthis do?”",
        "“The servants in my quarters,” answered Pao-yü, “muster a large crowd,\nso that, cousin, you are at perfect liberty to send for any one of them,\nwho might take your fancy; what’s the need therefore of asking me about\nit?”",
        "“If that be so,” continued lady Feng laughingly, “I’ll tell some one at\nonce to go and bring her over.”",
        "“Yes, she can go and fetch her,” acquiesced Pao-yü.",
        "While replying, he made an attempt to take his leave. “Come back,\"\nshouted lady Feng, “I’ve got something more to tell you.”",
        "“Our venerable senior has sent for me,” Pao-yü rejoined; “if you have\nanything to tell me you must wait till my return.”",
        "After this explanation, he there and then came over to his grandmother\nChia’s on this side, where he found that they had already got through\ntheir meal.",
        "“Have you had anything nice to eat with your mother?” old lady Chia\nasked.",
        "“There was really nothing nice,” Pao-yü smiled. “Yet I managed to have a\nbowl of rice more than usual.”",
        "“Where’s cousin Lin?” he then inquired.",
        "“She’s in the inner rooms,” answered his grandmother.",
        "Pao-yü stepped in. He caught sight of a waiting-maid, standing below,\nblowing into an iron, and two servant-girls seated on the stove-couch\nmaking a chalk line. Tai-yü with stooping head was cutting out something\nor other with a pair of scissors she held in her hand.",
        "Pao-yü advanced further in. “O! what’s this that you are up to!” he\nsmiled. “You have just had your rice and do you bob your head down in\nthis way! Why, in a short while you’ll be having a headache again!”",
        "Tai-yü, however, did not heed him in the least, but busied herself\ncutting out what she had to do.",
        "“The corner of that piece of satin is not yet right,” a servant-girl put\nin. “You had better iron it again!”",
        "Tai-yü threw down the scissors. “Why worry yourself about it?” she said;\n\"it will get quite right after a time.”",
        "But while Pao-yü was listening to what was being said, and was inwardly\nfeeling in low spirits, he became aware that Pao-ch’ai, T’an Ch’un and\nthe other girls had also arrived. After a short chat with dowager lady\nChia, Pao-ch’ai likewise entered the apartment to find out what her\ncousin Lin was up to. The moment she espied Lin Tai-yü engaged in\ncutting out something: “You have,” she cried, “attained more skill than\never; for there you can even cut out clothes!”",
        "“This too,” laughed Tai-yü sarcastically, “is a mere falsehood, to\nhoodwink people with, nothing more.”",
        "“I’ll tell you a joke,” replied Pao-ch’ai smiling, “when I just now said\nthat I did not know anything about that medicine, cousin Pao-yü felt\ndispleased.” “Who cares!” shouted Lin Tai-yü. “He’ll get all right\nshortly.”",
        "“Our worthy grandmother wishes to play at dominoes,” Pao-yü thereupon\ninterposed directing his remarks to Pao-ch’ai; “and there’s no one there\nat present to have a game with her; so you’d better go and play with\nher.”",
        "“Have I come over now to play dominoes!” promptly smiled Pao-ch’ai when\nshe heard his suggestion. With this remark, she nevertheless at once\nquitted the room.",
        "“It would be well for you to go,” urged Lin Tai-yü, “for there’s a tiger\nin here; and, look out, he might eat you up.”",
        "As she spoke, she went on with her cutting.",
        "Pao-yü perceived how both she was to give him any of her attention, and\nhe had no alternative but to force a smile and to observe: “You should\nalso go for a stroll! It will be time enough by and bye to continue your\ncutting.”",
        "But Tai-yü would pay no heed whatever to him. Pao-yü addressed himself\ntherefore to the servant-girls. “Who has taught her how to cut out these\nthings?” he asked.",
        "“What does it matter who taught me how to cut?” Tai-yü vehemently\nexclaimed, when she realised that he was speaking to the maids. “It’s no\nbusiness of yours, Mr. Secundus.”",
        "Pao-yü was then about to say something in his defence when he saw a\nservant come in and report that there was some one outside who wished to\nsee him. At this announcement, Pao-yü betook himself with alacrity out\nof the room.",
        "“O-mi-to-fu!” observed Tai-yü, turning outwards, “it wouldn’t matter to\nyou if you found me dead on your return!”",
        "On his arrival outside, Pao-yü discovered Pei Ming. “You are invited,\"\nhe said, “to go to Mr. Feng’s house.”",
        "Upon hearing this message, Pao-yü knew well enough that it was about the\nproject mooted the previous day, and accordingly he told him to go and\nask for his clothes, while he himself wended his steps into the library.",
        "Pei Ming came forthwith to the second gate and waited for some one to\nappear. Seeing an old woman walk out, Pei Ming went up to her. “Our\nMaster Secundus, Mr. Pao,” he told her, “is in the study waiting for his\nout-door clothes; so do go in, worthy dame, and deliver the message.”",
        "“It would be better,” replied the old woman, “if you did not echo your\nmother’s absurdities! Our Master Secundus, Mr. Pao, now lives in the\ngarden, and all the servants, who attend on him, stay in the garden; and\ndo you again come and bring the message here?”",
        "At these words, Pei Ming smiled. “You’re quite right,” he rejoined, “in\nreproving me, for I’ve become quite idiotic.”",
        "So saying, he repaired with quick step to the second gate on the east\nside, where, by a lucky hit, the young servant-boys on duty, were\nkicking marbles on the raised road. Pei Ming explained to them the\nobject of his coming. A young boy thereupon ran in. After a long\ninterval, he, at length, made his appearance, holding, enfolded in his\narms, a bundle of clothes, which he handed to Pei Ming, who then\nreturned to the library. Pao-yü effected a change in his costume, and\ngiving directions to saddle his horse, he only took along with him the\nfour servant-boys, Pei Ming, Chu Lo, Shuang Jui and Shou Erh, and\nstarted on his way. He reached Feng Tzu-ying’s doorway by a short cut. A\nservant announced his arrival, and Feng Tzu-ying came out and ushered\nhim in. Here he discovered Hsüeh P’an, who had already been waiting a\nlong time, and several singing-boys besides; as well as Chiang Yü-han,\nwho played female roles, and Yün Erh, a courtesan in the Chin Hsiang\ncourt. The whole company exchanged salutations. They next had tea. “What\nyou said the other day,” smiled Pao-yü, raising his cup, “about good\nfortune coming out of evil fortune has preyed so much upon my mind, both\nby day and night, that the moment I received your summons I hurried to\ncome immediately.”",
        "“My worthy cousins,” rejoined Feng Tzu-ying smiling. “You’re all far too\ncredulous! It’s a mere hoax that I made use of the other day. For so\nmuch did I fear that you would be sure to refuse if I openly asked you\nto a drinking bout, that I thought it fit to say what I did. But your\nattendance to-day, so soon after my invitation, makes it clear, little\nthough one would have thought it, that you’ve all taken it as pure\ngospel truth.”",
        "This admission evoked laughter from the whole company. The wines were\nafterwards placed on the table, and they took the seats consistent with\ntheir grades. Feng Tzu-ying first and foremost called the singing-boys\nand offered them a drink. Next he told Yün Erh to also approach and have\na cup of wine.",
        "By the time, however, that Hsüeh P’an had had his third cup, he of a\nsudden lost control over his feelings, and clasping Yün Erh’s hand in\nhis: “Do sing me,” he smiled, “that novel ballad of your own\ncomposition; and I’ll drink a whole jar full. Eh, will you?”",
        "This appeal compelled Yün Erh to take up the guitar. She then sang:",
        "  Lovers have I two.\n  To set aside either I cannot bear.\n  When my heart longs for thee to come,\n  It also yearns for him.\n  Both are in form handsome and fair.\n  Their beauty to describe it would be hard.\n  Just think, last night, when at a silent hour, we met in secret, by\n      the trellis\n  frame laden with roses white,\n  One to his feelings stealthily was giving vent,\n  When lo, the other caught us in the act,\n  And laying hands on us; there we three stood like litigants before the\n      bar.\n  And I had, verily, no word in answer for myself to give.",
        "At the close of her song, she laughed. “Well now,” she cried, “down with\nthat whole jar!”",
        "“Why, it isn’t worth a jarful,” smiled Hsüeh P’an at these words.\n\"Favour us with some other good song!”",
        "“Listen to what I have to suggest,” Pao-yü interposed, a smile on his\nlips. “If you go on drinking in this reckless manner, we will easily get\ndrunk and there will be no fun in it. I’ll take the lead and swallow a\nlarge cupful and put in force a new penalty; and any one of you who\ndoesn’t comply with it, will be mulcted in ten large cupfuls, in quick\nsuccession!”",
        "Speedily rising from the banquet, he poured the wine for the company.\nFeng Tzu-ying and the rest meanwhile exclaimed with one voice: “Quite\nright! quite right!”",
        "Pao-yü then lifted a large cup and drained it with one draught. “We will\nnow,” he proposed, “dilate on the four characters, ’sad, wounded, glad\nand joyful.’ But while discoursing about young ladies, we’ll have to\nillustrate the four states as well. At the end of this recitation, we’ll\nhave to drink the ’door cup’ over the wine, to sing an original and\nseasonable ballad, while over the heel taps, to make allusion to some\nobject on the table, and devise something with some old poetical lines\nor ancient scrolls, from the Four Books or the Five Classics, or with\nsome set phrases.”",
        "Hsüeh P’an gave him no time to finish. He was the first to stand up and\nprevent him from proceeding. “I won’t join you, so don’t count me; this\nis, in fact, done in order to play tricks upon me.”",
        "Yün Erh, however, also rose to her feet and shoved him down into his\nseat.",
        "“What are you in such a funk for?” she laughed. “You’re fortunate enough\nto be able to drink wine daily, and can’t you, forsooth, even come up to\nme? Yet I mean to recite, by and bye, my own share. If you say what’s\nright, well and good; if you don’t, you will simply have to swallow\nseveral cups of wine as a forfeit, and is it likely you’ll die from\ndrunkenness? Are you, pray, going now to disregard this rule and to\ndrink, instead, ten large cups; besides going down to pour the wine?”",
        "One and all clapped in applause. “Well said!” they shouted.",
        "After this, Hüeh P’an had no way out of it and felt compelled to resume\nhis seat.",
        "They then heard Pao-yü recite:",
        "  A girl is sad,\n  When her spring-time of life is far advanced and she still occupies a\n      vacant inner-room.\n  A girl feels wounded in her heart,\n  When she regrets having allowed her better half to go abroad and win a\n      marquisdom.\n  A girl is glad,\n  When looking in the mirror, at the time of her morning toilette, she\n      finds her colour fair.\n  A girl is joyful,\n  What time she sits on the frame of a gallows-swing, clad in a thin\n      spring gown.",
        "Having listened to him, “Capital!” one and all cried out in a chorus.\nHsüeh P’an alone raised his face, shook his head and remarked: “It isn’t\ngood, he must be fined.”",
        "“Why should he be fined?” demurred the party.",
        "“Because,” retorted Hsüeh P’an, “what he says is entirely unintelligible\nto me. So how can he not be fined?”",
        "Yün Erh gave him a pinch.–\"Just you quietly think of yours,” she\nlaughed; “for if by and bye you are not ready you’ll also have to bear a\nfine.”",
        "In due course Pao-yü took up the guitar. He was heard to sing:",
        "  “When mutual thoughts arise, tears, blood-stained, endless drop, like\n      lentiles sown broadcast.\n  In spring, in ceaseless bloom nourish willows and flowers around the\n      painted tower.\n  Inside the gauze-lattice peaceful sleep flies, when, after dark, come\n      wind and rain.\n  Both new-born sorrows and long-standing griefs cannot from memory ever\n      die!\n  E’en jade-fine rice, and gold-like drinks they make hard to go down;\n      they choke the throat.\n  The lass has not the heart to desist gazing in the glass at her wan\n      face.\n  Nothing can from that knitted brow of hers those frowns dispel;\n  For hard she finds it patient to abide till the clepsydra will have\n      run its course.\n  Alas! how fitly like the faint outline of a green hill which nought\n      can screen;\n  Or like a green-tinged stream, which ever ceaseless floweth onward far\n      and wide!”",
        "When the song drew to an end, his companions with one voice cried out:\n\"Excellent!”",
        "Hsüeh P’an was the only one to find fault. “There’s no metre in them,\"\nhe said.",
        "Pao-yü quaffed the “opening cup,” then seizing a pear, he added:",
        "  “While the rain strikes the pear-blossom I firmly close the door,”",
        "and thus accomplished the requirements of the rule.",
        "Feng Tzu-ying’s turn came next.",
        "  “A maid is glad.”",
        "he commenced:",
        "  When at her first confinement she gives birth to twins, both sons.\n  A maid is joyful,\n  When on the sly she to the garden creeps crickets to catch.\n  A maid is sad,\n  When her husband some sickness gets and lies in a bad state.\n  A maiden is wounded at heart,\n  When a fierce wind blows down the tower, where she makes her toilette.",
        "Concluding this recitation, he raised the cup and sang:",
        "  “Thou art what one could aptly call a man.\n  But thou’rt endowed with somewhat too much heart!\n  How queer thou art, cross-grained and impish shrewd!\n  A spirit too, thou couldst not be more shrewd.\n  If all I say thou dost not think is true,\n  In secret just a minute search pursue;\n  For then thou’lt know if I love thee or not.”",
        "His song over, he drank the “opening cup” and then observed:",
        "  “The cock crows when the moon’s rays shine upon the thatchèd inn.”",
        "After his observance of the rule followed Yün Erh’s turn.",
        "  A girl is sad,",
        "Yün Erh began,",
        "  When she tries to divine on whom she will depend towards the end of\n      life.",
        "“My dear child!” laughingly exclaimed Hsüeh P’an, “your worthy Mr. Hsüeh\nstill lives, and why do you give way to fears?”",
        "“Don’t confuse her!” remonstrated every one of the party, “don’t muddle\nher!”",
        "  “A maiden is wounded at heart.”",
        "Yün Erh proceeded:",
        "  “When her mother beats and scolds her and never for an instant doth\n       desist.”",
        "“It was only the other day,” interposed Hsüeh P’an, “that I saw your\nmother and that I told her that I would not have her beat you.”",
        "“If you still go on babbling,” put in the company with one consent,\n\"you’ll be fined ten cups.”",
        "Hsüeh P’an promptly administered himself a slap on the mouth. “How you\nlack the faculty of hearing!” he exclaimed. “You are not to say a word\nmore!”",
        "  “A girl is glad,”",
        "Yün Erh then resumed:",
        "  When her lover cannot brook to leave her and return home.\n  A maiden is joyful,\n  When hushing the pan-pipe and double pipe, a stringed instrument she\n      thrums.",
        "At the end of her effusion, she at once began to sing:",
        "  “T’is the third day of the third moon, the nutmegs bloom;\n  A maggot, lo, works hard to pierce into a flower;\n  But though it ceaseless bores it cannot penetrate.\n  So crouching on the buds, it swing-like rocks itself.\n  My precious pet, my own dear little darling,\n  If I don’t choose to open how can you steal in?”",
        "Finishing her song, she drank the “opening cup,” after which she added:\n\"the delicate peach-blossom,” and thus complied with the exigencies of\nthe rule.",
        "Next came Hsüeh P’an. “Is it for me to speak now?” Hsüeh P’an asked.",
        "  “A maiden is sad...”",
        "But a long time elapsed after these words were uttered and yet nothing\nfurther was heard.",
        "“Sad for what?” Feng Tzu-ying laughingly asked. “Go on and tell us at\nonce!”",
        "Hsüeh P’an was much perplexed. His eyes rolled about like a bell.",
        "  “A girl is sad...”",
        "he hastily repeated. But here again he coughed twice before he\nproceeded.",
        "  “A girl is sad.”",
        "he said:",
        "  “When she marries a spouse who is a libertine.”",
        "This sentence so tickled the fancy of the company that they burst out\ninto a loud fit of laughter.",
        "“What amuses you so?” shouted Hsüeh P’an, “is it likely that what I say\nis not correct? If a girl marries a man, who chooses to forget all\nvirtue, how can she not feel sore at heart?”",
        "But so heartily did they all laugh that their bodies were bent in two.\n\"What you say is quite right,” they eagerly replied. “So proceed at once\nwith the rest.”",
        "Hsüeh P’an thereupon stared with vacant gaze.",
        "  “A girl is grieved....”",
        "he added:",
        "But after these few words he once more could find nothing to say.",
        "“What is she grieved about?” they asked.",
        "  “When a huge monkey finds its way into the inner room.”",
        "Hsüeh P’an retorted.",
        "This reply set every one laughing. “He must be mulcted,” they cried, “he\nmust be mulcted. The first one could anyhow be overlooked; but this line\nis more unintelligible.”",
        "As they said this, they were about to pour the wine, when Pao-yü\nsmilingly interfered. “The rhyme is all right,” he observed.",
        "“The master of the rules,” Hsüeh P’an remarked, “approves it in every\nway, so what are you people fussing about?”",
        "Hearing this, the company eventually let the matter drop.",
        "“The two lines, that follow, are still more difficult,” suggested Yün\nErh with a smile, “so you had better let me recite for you.”",
        "“Fiddlesticks!” exclaimed Hsüeh P’an, “do you really fancy that I have\nno good ones! Just you listen to what I shall say.",
        " “A girl is glad,\n  When in the bridal room she lies, with flowery candles burning, and\n      she is loth to rise at morn.”",
        "This sentiment filled one and all with amazement. “How supremely\nexcellent this line is!” they ejaculated.",
        "  “A girl is joyful,”",
        "Hsüeh P’an resumed,",
        "  “During the consummation of wedlock.”",
        "Upon catching this remark, the party turned their heads away, and\nshouted: “Dreadful! Dreadful! But quick sing your song and have done.”",
        "Forthwith Hsüeh P’an sang:",
        "  “A mosquito buzzes heng, heng, heng!”",
        "Every one was taken by surprise. “What kind of song is this?” they\ninquired.",
        "But Hsüeh P’an went on singing:",
        "  “Two flies buzz weng, weng, weng.”",
        "“Enough,” shouted his companions, “that will do, that will do!”",
        "“Do you want to hear it or not?” asked Hsüeh P’an, “this is a new kind\nof song, called the ’Heng, heng air,’ but if you people are not disposed\nto listen, let me off also from saying what I have to say over the\nheel-taps and I won’t then sing.”",
        "“We’ll let you off! We’ll let you off,” answered one and all, “so don’t\nbe hindering others.”",
        "  “A maiden is sad,”",
        "Chiang Yü-han at once began,",
        "  When her husband leaves home and never does return.\n  A maiden is disconsolate,\n  When she has no money to go and buy some olea frangrans oil.\n  A maiden is glad,\n  When the wick of the lantern forms two heads like twin flowers on one\n      stem.\n  A maiden is joyful,\n  When true conjugal peace prevails between her and her mate.",
        "His recital over, he went on to sing:",
        "  “How I love thee with those seductive charms of thine, heaven-born!\n  In truth thou’rt like a living fairy from the azure skies!\n  The spring of life we now enjoy; we are yet young in years.\n  Our union is, indeed, a happy match!\n  But. lo! the milky way doth at its zenith soar;\n  Hark to the drums which beat around in the watch towers;\n  So raise the silver lamp and let us soft under the nuptial curtain\n      steal.”",
        "Finishing the song, he drank the “opening cup.” “I know,” he smiled,\n\"few poetical quotations bearing on this sort of thing. By a stroke of\ngood fortune, however, I yesterday conned a pair of antithetical\nscrolls; of these I can only remember just one line, but lucky enough\nfor me the object it refers to figures as well on this festive board.”",
        "This said he forthwith drained the wine, and, picking up a bud of a\ndiminutive variety of olea fragrans, he recited:",
        "  “When the perfume of flowers wafts (hsi jen) itself into a man, he\n      knows the day is warm.”",
        "The company unanimously conceded that the rule had been adhered to. But\nHsüeh P’an once again jumped up. “It’s awful, awful!” he bawled out\nboisterously; “he should be fined, he should be made to pay a forfeit;\nthere’s no precious article whatever on this table; how is it then that\nyou introduce precious things?”",
        "“There was nothing about precious things!” Chiang Yü-han vehemently\nexplained.",
        "“What I are you still prevaricating?” Hsüeh P’an cried, “Well, repeat it\nagain!”",
        "Chiang Yü-han had no other course but to recite the line a second time.\n\"Now is not Hsi Jen a precious thing?” Hsüeh P’an asked. “If she isn’t,\nwhat is she? And if you don’t believe me, you ask him about it,\"\npointing, at the conclusion of this remark, at Pao-yü.",
        "Pao-yü felt very uncomfortable. Rising to his feet, “Cousin,” he\nobserved, “you should be fined heavily.”",
        "“I should be! I should be!” Hsüeh P’an shouted, and saying this, he took\nup the wine and poured it down his throat with one gulp.",
        "Feng Tzu-ying, Chiang Yü-han and their companions thereupon asked him to\nexplain the allusion. Yün Erh readily told them, and Chiang Yü-han\nhastily got up and pleaded guilty.",
        "“Ignorance,” the party said with one consent, “does not amount to\nguilt.”",
        "But presently Pao-yü quitted the banquet to go and satisfy a natural\nwant and Chiang Yü-han followed him out. The two young fellows halted\nunder the eaves of the verandah, and Chiang Yü-han then recommenced to\nmake ample apologies. Pao-yü, however, was so attracted by his handsome\nand genial appearance, that he took quite a violent fancy to him; and\nsqueezing his hand in a firm grip. “If you have nothing to do,” he\nurged, “do let us go over to our place. I’ve got something more to ask\nyou. It’s this, there’s in your worthy company some one called Ch’i\nKuan, with a reputation extending at present throughout the world; but,\nunfortunately, I alone have not had the good luck of seeing him even\nonce.”",
        "“This is really,” rejoined Chiang Yü-han with a smile, “my own infant \nname.”",
        "This disclosure at once made Pao-yü quite exuberant, and stamping his\nfeet he smiled. “How lucky! I’m in luck’s way!” he exclaimed. “In very\ntruth your reputation is no idle report. But to-day is our first\nmeeting, and what shall I do?”",
        "After some thought, he produced a fan from his sleeve, and, unloosening\none of the jade pendants, he handed it to Ch’i Kuan. “This is a mere\ntrifle,” he said. “It does not deserve your acceptance, yet it will be a\nsmall souvenir of our acquaintance to-day.”",
        "Ch’i Kuan received it with a smile. “I do not deserve,” he replied,\n\"such a present. How am I worthy of such an honour! But never mind, I’ve\nalso got about me here a strange thing, which I put on this morning; it\nis brand-new yet, and will, I hope, suffice to prove to you a little of\nthe feeling of esteem which I entertain for you.”",
        "With these protestations, he raised his garment, and, untying a deep red\nsash, with which his nether clothes were fastened, he presented it to\nPao-yü. “This sash,” he remarked, “is an article brought as tribute from\nthe Queen of the Hsi Hsiang Kingdom. If you attach this round you in\nsummer, your person will emit a fragrant perfume, and it will not\nperspire. It was given to me yesterday by the Prince of Pei Ching, and\nit is only to-day that I put it on. To any one else, I would certainly\nnot be willing to present it. But, Mr. Secundus, please do unfasten the\none you have on and give it to me to bind round me.”",
        "This proposal extremely delighted Pao-yü. With precipitate haste, he\naccepted his gift, and, undoing the dark brown sash he wore, he\nsurrendered it to Ch’i Kuan. But both had just had time to adjust their\nrespective sashes when they heard a loud voice say: “Oh! I’ve caught\nyou!” And they perceived Hsüeh P’an come out by leaps and bounds.\nClutching the two young fellows, “What do you,” he exclaimed, “leave\nyour wine for and withdraw from the banquet. Be quick and produce those\nthings, and let me see them!”",
        "“There’s nothing to see!” rejoined the two young fellows with one voice.",
        "Hsüeh P’an, however, would by no means fall in with their views. And it\nwas only Feng Tzu-ying, who made his appearance on the scene, who\nsucceeded in dissuading him. So resuming their seats, they drank until\ndark, when the company broke up.",
        "Pao-yü, on his return into the garden, loosened his clothes, and had\ntea. But Hsi Jen noticed that the pendant had disappeared from his fan\nand she inquired of him what had become of it.",
        "“I must have lost it this very moment,” Pao-yü replied.",
        "At bedtime, however, descrying a deep red sash, with spots like specks\nof blood, attached round his waist, Hsi Jen guessed more or less the\ntruth of what must have transpired. “As you have such a nice sash to\nfasten your trousers with,” Hsi Jen consequently said, “you’d better\nreturn that one of mine.”",
        "This reminder made the fact dawn upon Pao-yü that the sash had\noriginally been the property of Hsi Jen, and that he should by rights\nnot have parted with it; but however much he felt his conscience smitten\nby remorse, he failed to see how he could very well disclose the truth\nto her. He could therefore only put on a smiling expression and add,\n\"I’ll give you another one instead.”",
        "Hsi Jen was prompted by his rejoinder to nod her head and sigh. “I felt\nsure;” she observed; “that you’d go again and do these things! Yet you\nshouldn’t take my belongings and bestow them on that low-bred sort of\npeople. Can it be that no consideration finds a place in your heart?”",
        "She then felt disposed to tender him a few more words of admonition, but\ndreading, on the other hand, lest she should, by irritating him, bring\nthe fumes of the wine to his head, she thought it best to also retire to\nbed.",
        "Nothing worth noticing occurred during that night. The next day, when\nshe woke up at the break of day, she heard Pao-yü call out laughingly:\n\"Robbers have been here in the night; are you not aware of it? Just you\nlook at my trousers.”",
        "Hsi Jen lowered her head and looked. She saw at a glance that the sash,\nwhich Pao-yü had worn the previous day, was bound round her own waist,\nand she at once realised that Pao-yü must have effected the change\nduring the night; but promptly unbinding it, “I don’t care for such\nthings!” she cried, “quick, take it away!”",
        "At the sight of her manner, Pao-yü had to coax her with gentle terms.\nThis so disarmed Hsi Jen, that she felt under the necessity of putting\non the sash; but, subsequently when Pao-yü stepped out of the apartment,\nshe at last pulled it off, and, throwing it away in an empty box, she\nfound one of hers and fastened it round her waist.",
        "Pao-yü, however, did not in the least notice what she did, but inquired\nwhether anything had happened the day before.",
        "“Lady Secunda,” Hsi Jen explained, “dispatched some one and fetched\nHsiao Hung away. Her wish was to have waited for your return; but as I\nthought that it was of no consequence, I took upon myself to decide, and\nsent her off.”",
        "“That’s all right!” rejoined Pao-yü. “I knew all about it, there was no\nneed for her to wait.”",
        "“Yesterday,” resumed Hsi Jen, “the Imperial Consort deputed the Eunuch\nHsia to bring a hundred and twenty ounces of silver and to convey her\ncommands that from the first to the third, there should be offered, in\nthe Ch’ing Hsu temple, thanksgiving services to last for three days and\nthat theatrical performances should be given, and oblations presented:\nand to tell our senior master, Mr. Chia Chen, to take all the gentlemen,\nand go and burn incense and worship Buddha. Besides this, she also sent\npresents for the dragon festival.”",
        "Continuing, she bade a young servant-maid produce the presents, which\nhad been received the previous day. Then he saw two palace fans of the\nbest quality, two strings of musk-scented beads, two rolls of silk, as\nfine as the phoenix tail, and a superior mat worked with hibiscus. At\nthe sight of these things, Pao-yü was filled with immeasurable\npleasure, and he asked whether the articles brought to all the others\nwere similar to his.\r\n\r\n“The only things in excess of yours that our venerable mistress has,\"\nHsi Jen explained, “consist of a scented jade sceptre and a pillow made\nof agate. Those of your worthy father and mother, our master and\nmistress, and of your aunt exceed yours by a scented sceptre of jade.\nYours are the same as Miss Pao’s. Miss Lin’s are like those of Misses\nSecunda, Tertia and Quarta, who received nothing beyond a fan and\nseveral pearls and none of all the other things. As for our senior lady,\nMrs. Chia Chu, and lady Secunda, these two got each two rolls of gauze,\ntwo rolls of silk, two scented bags, and two sticks of medicine.”",
        "After listening to her enumeration, “What’s the reason of this?” he\nsmiled. “How is it that Miss Lin’s are not the same as mine, but that\nMiss Pao’s instead are like my own? May not the message have been\nwrongly delivered?”",
        "“When they were brought out of the palace yesterday,” Hsi Jen rejoined,\n\"they were already divided in respective shares, and slips were also\nplaced on them, so that how could any mistake have been made? Yours were\namong those for our dowager lady’s apartments. When I went and fetched\nthem, her venerable ladyship said that I should tell you to go there\nto-morrow at the fifth watch to return thanks.",
        "“Of course, it’s my duty to go over,” Pao-yü cried at these words, but\nforthwith calling Tzu Chüan: “Take these to your Miss Lin,” he told her,\n\"and say that I got them, yesterday, and that she is at liberty to keep\nout of them any that take her fancy.”",
        "Tzu Chüan expressed her obedience and took the things away. After a\nshort time she returned. “Miss Lin says,” she explained, “that she also\ngot some yesterday, and that you, Master Secundus, should keep yours.”",
        "Hearing this reply, Pao-yü quickly directed a servant to put them away.\nBut when he had washed his face and stepped out of doors, bent upon\ngoing to his grandmother’s on the other side, in order to pay his\nobeisance, he caught sight of Lin Tai-yü coming along towards him, from\nthe opposite direction. Pao-yü hurriedly walked up to her, “I told you,\"\nhe smiled, “to select those you liked from my things; how is it you\ndidn’t choose any?”",
        "Lin Tai-yü had long before banished from her recollection the incident\nof the previous day, which had made her angry with Pao-yü, and was only\nexercised about the occurrence of this present occasion. “I’m not gifted\nwith such extreme good fortune,” she consequently answered, “as to be\nable to accept them. I can’t compete with Miss Pao, in connection with\nwhom something or other about gold or about jade is mentioned. We are\nsimply beings connected with the vegetable kingdom.”",
        "The allusion to the two words “gold and jade,” aroused, of a sudden,\nmuch emotion in the heart of Pao-yü. “If beyond what people say about\ngold or jade,” he protested, “the idea of any such things ever crosses\nmy mind, may the heavens annihilate me, and may the earth extinguish me,\nand may I for ten thousand generations never assume human form!”",
        "These protestations convinced Lin Tai-yü that suspicion had been aroused\nin him. With all promptitude, she smiled and observed, “They’re all to\nno use! Why utter such oaths, when there’s no rhyme or reason! Who cares\nabout any gold or any jade of yours!”",
        "“It would be difficult for me to tell you, to your face, all the secrets\nof my heart,” Pao-yü resumed, “but by and bye you’ll surely come to know\nall about them! After the three–my old grandmother, my father and my\nmother–you, my cousin, hold the fourth place; and, if there be a\nfifth, I’m ready to swear another oath.”",
        "“You needn’t swear any more,” Lin Tai-yü replied, “I’m well aware that\nI, your younger cousin, have a place in your heart; but the thing is\nthat at the sight of your elder cousin, you at once forget all about\nyour younger cousin.”",
        "“This comes again from over-suspicion!” ejaculated Pao; “for I’m not at\nall disposed that way.”",
        "“Well,” resumed Lin Tai-yü, “why did you yesterday appeal to me when\nthat hussey Pao-ch’ai would not help you by telling a story? Had it been\nI, who had been guilty of any such thing, I don’t know what you wouldn’t\nhave done again.”",
        "But during their tête-a-tête, they espied Pao-ch’ai approach from\nthe opposite direction, so readily they beat a retreat. Pao-ch’ai had\ndistinctly caught sight of them, but pretending she had not seen them,\nshe trudged on her way, with lowered head, and repaired into Madame\nWang’s apartments. After a short stay, she came to this side to pay\ndowager lady Chia a visit. With her she also found Pao-yü.",
        "Pao-ch’ai ever made it a point to hold Pao-yü aloof as her mother had in\ndays gone by mentioned to Madame Wang and her other relatives that the\ngold locket had been the gift of a bonze, that she had to wait until\nsuch time as some suitor with jade turned up before she could be given\nin marriage, and other similar confidences. But on discovery the\nprevious day that Yüan Ch’un’s presents to her alone resembled those of\nPao-yü, she began to feel all the more embarrassed. Luckily, however,\nPao-yü was so entangled in Lin Tai-yü’s meshes and so absorbed in heart\nand mind with fond thoughts of his Lin Tai-yü that he did not pay the\nleast attention to this circumstance. But she unawares now heard Pao-yü\nremark with a smile: “Cousin Pao, let me see that string of scented\nbeads of yours!”",
        "By a strange coincidence, Pao-ch’ai wore the string of beads round her\nleft wrist so she had no alternative, when Pao-yü asked her for it, than\nto take it off. Pao-ch’ai, however, was naturally inclined to\nembonpoint, and it proved therefore no easy matter for her to get the\nbeads off; and while Pao-yü stood by watching her snow-white arm,\nfeelings of admiration were quickly stirred up in his heart. “Were this\narm attached to Miss Lin’s person,” he secretly pondered, “I might,\npossibly have been able to caress it! But it is, as it happens, part and\nparcel of her body; how I really do deplore this lack of good fortune.”",
        "Suddenly he bethought himself of the secret of gold and jade, and he\nagain scanned Pao-ch’ai’s appearance. At the sight of her countenance,\nresembling a silver bowl, her eyes limpid like water and almond-like in\nshape, her lips crimson, though not rouged, her eyebrows jet-black,\nthough not pencilled, also of that fascination and grace which presented\nsuch a contrast to Lin Tai-yü’s style of beauty, he could not refrain\nfrom falling into such a stupid reverie, that though Pao-ch’ai had got\nthe string of beads off her wrist, and was handing them to him, he\nforgot all about them and made no effort to take them. Pao-ch’ai\nrealised that he was plunged in abstraction, and conscious of the\nawkward position in which she was placed, she put down the string of\nbeads, and turning round was on the point of betaking herself away, when\nshe perceived Lin Tai-yü, standing on the door-step, laughing\nsignificantly while biting a handkerchief she held in her mouth. “You\ncan’t resist,” Pao-ch’ai said, “a single puff of wind; and why do you\nstand there and expose yourself to the very teeth of it?”",
        "“Wasn’t I inside the room?” rejoined Lin Tai-yü, with a cynical smile.\n\"But I came out to have a look as I heard a shriek in the heavens; it\nturned out, in fact, to be a stupid wild goose!”",
        "“A stupid wild goose!” repeated Pao-ch’ai. “Where is it, let me also see\nit!”",
        "“As soon as I got out,” answered Lin Tai-yü, “it flew away with a\n’t’e-rh’ sort of noise.”",
        "While replying, she threw the handkerchief, she was holding, straight\ninto Pao-yü’s face. Pao-yü was quite taken by surprise. He was hit on\nthe eye. “Ai-yah!” he exclaimed.",
        "But, reader, do you want to hear the sequel? In that case, listen to the\ncircumstances, which will be disclosed in the next chapter.",
        "  A happy man enjoys a full measure of happiness, but still prays for\n      happiness.\n  A beloved girl is very much loved, but yet craves for more love.",
        "Pao-yü, so our story runs, was gazing vacantly, when Tai-yü, at a moment\nleast expected, flung her handkerchief at him, which just hit him on the\neyes, and frightened him out of his wits. “Who was it?” he cried.",
        "Lin Tai-yü nodded her head and smiled. “I would not venture to do such a\nthing,” she said, “it was a mere slip of my hand. As cousin Pao-ch’ai\nwished to see the silly wild goose, I was pointing it out to her, when\nthe handkerchief inadvertently flew out of my grip.”",
        "Pao-yü kept on rubbing his eyes. The idea suggested itself to him to\nmake some remonstrance, but he could not again very well open his lips.",
        "Presently, lady Feng arrived. She then alluded, in the course of\nconversation, to the thanksgiving service, which was to be offered on\nthe first, in the Ch’ing Hsü temple, and invited Pao-ch’ai, Pao-yü,\nTai-yü and the other inmates with them to be present at the theatricals.",
        "“Never mind,” smiled Pao-ch’ai, “it’s too hot; besides, what plays\nhaven’t I seen? I don’t mean to come.”",
        "“It’s cool enough over at their place,” answered lady Feng. “There are\nalso two-storied buildings on either side; so we must all go! I’ll send\nservants a few days before to drive all that herd of Taoist priests out,\nto sweep the upper stories, hang up curtains, and to keep out every\nsingle loafer from the interior of the temple; so it will be all right\nlike that. I’ve already told our Madame Wang that if you people don’t\ngo, I mean to go all alone, as I’ve been again in very low spirits these\nlast few days, and as when theatricals come off at home, it’s out of the\nquestion for me to look on with any peace and quiet.”",
        "When dowager lady Chia heard what she said, she smiled. “Well, in that\ncase,” she remarked, “I’ll go along with you.”",
        "Lady Feng, at these words, gave a smile. “Venerable ancestor,” she\nreplied, “were you also to go, it would be ever so much better; yet I\nwon’t feel quite at my ease!”",
        "“To-morrow,” dowager lady Chia continued, “I can stay in the two-storied\nbuilding, situated on the principal site, while you can go to the one on\nthe side. You can then likewise dispense with coming over to where I\nshall be to stand on any ceremonies. Will this suit you or not?”",
        "“This is indeed,” lady Feng smiled, “a proof of your regard for me, my\nworthy senior.”",
        "Old lady Chia at this stage faced Pao-ch’ai. “You too should go,” she\nsaid, “so should your mother; for if you remain the whole day long at\nhome, you will again sleep your head off.”",
        "Pao-ch’ai felt constrained to signify her assent. Dowager lady Chia then\nalso despatched domestics to invite Mrs. Hsüeh; and, on their way, they\nnotified Madame Wang that she was to take the young ladies along with\nher. But Madame Wang felt, in the first place, in a poor state of\nhealth, and was, in the second, engaged in making preparations for the\nreception of any arrivals from Yüan Ch’un, so that she, at an early\nhour, sent word that it was impossible for her to leave the house. Yet\nwhen she received old lady Chia’s behest, she smiled and exclaimed: “Are\nher spirits still so buoyant!” and transmitted the message into the\ngarden that any, who had any wish to avail themselves of the\nopportunity, were at liberty to go on the first, with their venerable\nsenior as their chaperonne. As soon as these tidings were spread abroad,\nevery one else was indifferent as to whether they went or not; but of\nthose girls who, day after day, never put their foot outside the\ndoorstep, which of them was not keen upon going, the moment they heard\nthe permission conceded to them? Even if any of their respective\nmistresses were too lazy to move, they employed every expedient to\ninduce them to go. Hence it was that Li Kung-ts’ai and the other inmates\nsignified their unanimous intention to be present. Dowager lady Chia, at\nthis, grew more exultant than ever, and she issued immediate directions\nfor servants to go and sweep and put things in proper order. But to all\nthese preparations, there is no necessity of making detailed reference;\nsufficient to relate that on the first day of the moon, carriages stood\nin a thick maze, and men and horses in close concourse, at the entrance\nof the Jung Kuo mansion.",
        "When the servants, the various managers and other domestics came to\nlearn that the Imperial Consort was to perform good deeds and that\ndowager lady Chia was to go in person and offer incense, they arranged,\nas it happened that the first of the moon, which was the principal day\nof the ceremonies, was, in addition, the season of the dragon-boat\nfestival, all the necessary articles in perfect readiness and with\nunusual splendour. Shortly, old lady Chia and the other inmates started\non their way. The old lady sat in an official chair, carried by eight\nbearers: widow Li, lady Feng and Mrs. Hsüeh, each in a four-bearer\nchair. Pao-ch’ai and Tai-yü mounted together a curricle with green cover\nand pearl tassels, bearing the eight precious things. The three sisters,\nYing Ch’un, T’an Ch’un, and Hsi Ch’un got in a carriage with red wheels\nand ornamented hood. Next in order, followed dowager lady Chia’s\nwaiting-maids, Yüan Yang, Ying Wu, Hu Po, Chen Chu; Lin Tai-yü’s\nwaiting-maids Tzu Chüan, Hsüeh Yen, and Ch’un Ch’ien; Pao-ch’ai’s\nwaiting-maids Ying Erh and Wen Hsing; Ying Ch’un’s servant-girls Ssu\nCh’i and Hsiu Chü; T’an Ch’un’s waiting-maids Shih Shu and Ts’ui Mo; Hsi\nCh’un’s servant-girls Ju Hua and Ts’ai P’ing; and Mrs. Hsüeh’s\nwaiting-maids T’ung Hsi, and T’ung Kuei. Besides these, were joined to\ntheir retinue: Hsiang Ling and Hsiang Ling’s servant-girl Ch’in Erh;\nMrs. Li’s waiting-maids Su Yün and Pi Yüeh; lady Feng’s servant-girls\nP’ing Erh, Feng Erh and Hsiao Hung, as well as Madame Wang’s two\nwaiting-maids Chin Ch’uan and Ts’ai Yün. Along with lady Feng, came a\nnurse carrying Ta Chieh Erh. She drove in a separate carriage, together\nwith a couple of servant-girls. Added also to the number of the suite\nwere matrons and nurses, attached to the various establishments, and the\nwives of the servants of the household, who were in attendance out of\ndoors. Their carriages, forming one black solid mass, therefore, crammed\nthe whole extent of the street.",
        "Dowager lady Chia and other members of the party had already proceeded a\nconsiderable distance in their chairs, and yet the inmates at the gate\nhad not finished mounting their vehicles. This one shouted: “I won’t sit\nwith you.” That one cried: “You’ve crushed our mistress’ bundle.” In the\ncarriages yonder, one screamed: “You’ve pulled my flowers off.” Another\none nearer exclaimed: “You’ve broken my fan.” And they chatted and\nchatted, and talked and laughed with such incessant volubility, that\nChou Jui’s wife had to go backward and forward calling them to task.\n\"Girls,” she said, “this is the street. The on-lookers will laugh at\nyou!” But it was only after she had expostulated with them several times\nthat any sign of improvement became at last visible.",
        "The van of the procession had long ago reached the entrance of the\nCh’ing Hsü Temple. Pao-yü rode on horseback. He preceded the chair\noccupied by his grandmother Chia. The throngs that filled the streets\nranged themselves on either side.",
        "On their arrival at the temple, the sound of bells and the rattle of\ndrums struck their ear. Forthwith appeared the head-bonze Chang, a stick\nof incense in hand; his cloak thrown over his shoulders. He took his\nstand by the wayside at the head of a company of Taoist priests to\npresent his greetings. The moment dowager lady Chia reached, in her\nchair, the interior of the main gate, she descried the lares and\npenates, the lord presiding over that particular district, and the clay\nimages of the various gods, and she at once gave orders to halt. Chia\nChen advanced to receive her acting as leader to the male members of the\nfamily. Lady Feng was well aware that Yüan Yang and the other attendants\nwere at the back and could not overtake their old mistress, so she\nherself alighted from her chair to volunteer her services. She was about\nto hastily press forward and support her, when, by a strange accident, a\nyoung Taoist neophyte, of twelve or thirteen years of age, who held a\ncase containing scissors, with which he had been snuffing the candles\nburning in the various places, just seized the opportunity to run out\nand hide himself, when he unawares rushed, head foremost, into lady\nFeng’s arms. Lady Feng speedily raised her hand and gave him such a slap\non the face that she made the young fellow reel over and perform a\nsomersault. “You boorish young bastard!” she shouted, “where are you\nrunning to?”",
        "The young Taoist did not even give a thought to picking up the scissors,\nbut crawling up on to his feet again, he tried to scamper outside. But\njust at that very moment Pao-ch’ai and the rest of the young ladies were\ndismounting from their vehicles, and the matrons and women-servants were\nclosing them in so thoroughly on all sides that not a puff of wind or a\ndrop of rain could penetrate, and when they perceived a Taoist neophyte\ncome rushing headlong out of the place, they, with one voice, exclaimed:\n\"Catch him, catch him! Beat him, beat him!”",
        "Old lady Chia overheard their cries. She asked with alacrity what the\nfuss was all about. Chia Chen immediately stepped outside to make\ninquiries. Lady Feng then advanced and, propping up her old senior, she\nwent on to explain to her that a young Taoist priest, whose duties were\nto snuff the candles, had not previously retired out of the compound,\nand that he was now endeavouring to recklessly force his way out.”",
        "“Be quick and bring the lad here,” shouted dowager lady Chia, as soon as\nshe heard her explanation, “but, mind, don’t frighten him. Children of\nmean families invariably get into the way of being spoilt by\nover-indulgence. How ever could he have set eyes before upon such\ndisplay as this! Were you to frighten him, he will really be much to be\npitied; and won’t his father and mother be exceedingly cut up?”",
        "As she spoke, she asked Chia Chen to go and do his best to bring him\nround. Chia Chen felt under the necessity of going, and he managed to\ndrag the lad into her presence. With the scissors still clasped in his\nhand, the lad fell on his knees, and trembled violently.",
        "Dowager lady Chia bade Chia Chen raise him up. “There’s nothing to\nfear!” she said reassuringly. Then she asked him how old he was.",
        "The boy, however, could on no account give vent to speech.",
        "“Poor boy!” once more exclaimed the old lady. And continuing: “Brother\nChen,” she added, addressing herself to Chia Chen, “take him away, and\ngive him a few cash to buy himself fruit with; and do impress upon every\none that they are not to bully him.”",
        "Chia Chen signified his assent and led him off.",
        "During this time, old lady Chia, taking along with her the whole family\nparty, paid her devotions in storey after storey, and visited every\nplace.",
        "The young pages, who stood outside, watched their old mistress and the\nother inmates enter the second row of gates. But of a sudden they espied\nChia Chen wend his way outwards, leading a young Taoist priest, and\ncalling the servants to come, say; “Take him and give him several\nhundreds of cash and abstain from ill-treating him.” At these orders,\nthe domestics approached with hurried step and led him off.",
        "Chia Chen then inquired from the terrace-steps where the majordomo was.\nAt this inquiry, the pages standing below, called out in chorus,\n\"Majordomo!”",
        "Lin Chih-hsiao ran over at once, while adjusting his hat with one hand,\nand appeared in the presence of Chia Chen.",
        "“Albeit this is a spacious place,” Chia Chen began, “we muster a good\nconcourse to-day, so you’d better bring into this court those servants,\nwho’ll be of any use to you, and send over into that one those who\nwon’t. And choose a few from among those young pages to remain on duty,\nat the second gate and at the two side entrances, so as to ask for\nthings and deliver messages. Do you understand me, yes or no? The young\nladies and ladies have all come out of town to-day, and not a single\noutsider must be permitted to put his foot in here.”",
        "“I understand,” replied Lin Chih-hsiao hurriedly signifying his\nobedience. Next he uttered several yes’s.",
        "“Now,” proceeded Chia Chen; “you can go on your way. But how is it, I\ndon’t see anything of Jung Erh?” he went on to ask.",
        "This question was barely out of his lips, when he caught sight of Jung\nErh running out of the belfry. “Look at him,” shouted Chia Chen. “Look\nat him! I don’t feel hot in here, and yet he must go in search of a cool\nplace. Spit at him!” he cried to the family servants.",
        "The young pages were fully aware that Chia Chen’s ordinary disposition\nwas such that he could not brook contradiction, and one of the lads\nspeedily came forward and sputtered in Chia Jung’s face. But Chia Chen\nstill kept his gaze fixed on him, so the young page had to inquire of\nChia Jung: “Master doesn’t feel hot here, and how is it that you, Sir,\nhave been the first to go and get cool?”",
        "Chia Jung however dropped his arms, and did not venture to utter a\nsingle sound. Chia Yün, Chia P’ing, Chia Ch’in and the other young\npeople overheard what was going on and not only were they scared out of\ntheir wits, but even Chia Lien, Chia Pin, Chia Ch’ung and their\ncompanions were stricken with intense fright and one by one they quietly\nslipped down along the foot of the wall.",
        "“What are you standing there for?” Chia Chen shouted to Chia Jung.\n\"Don’t you yet get on your horse and gallop home and tell your mother\nthat our venerable senior is here with all the young ladies, and bid\nthem come at once and wait upon them?”",
        "As soon as Chia Jung heard these words, he ran out with hurried stride\nand called out repeatedly for his horse. Now he felt resentment, arguing\nwithin himself: “Who knows what he has been up to the whole morning,\nthat he now finds fault with me!” Now he went on to abuse the young\nservants, crying: “Are your hands made fast, that you can’t lead the\nhorse round?” And he felt inclined to bid a servant-boy go on the\nerrand, but fearing again lest he should subsequently be found out, and\nbe at a loss how to account for his conduct he felt compelled to proceed\nin person; so mounting his steed, he started on his way.",
        "But to return to Chia Chen. Just as he was about to be take himself\ninside, he noticed the Taoist Chang, who stood next to him, force a\nsmile. “I’m not properly speaking,” he remarked, “on the same footing as\nthe others and should be in attendance inside, but as on account of the\nintense heat, the young ladies have come out of doors, I couldn’t\npresume to take upon myself to intrude and ask what your orders, Sir,\nare. But the dowager lady may possibly inquire about me, or may like to\nvisit any part of the temple, so I shall wait in here.”",
        "Chia Chen was fully cognisant that this Taoist priest, Chang, had, it is\ntrue, in past days, stood as a substitute for the Duke of the Jung Kuo\nmansion, but that the former Emperor had, with his own lips, conferred\nupon him the appellation of the ’Immortal being of the Great Unreal,’\nthat he held at present the seal of ’Taoist Superior,’ that the reigning\nEmperor had raised him to the rank of the ’Pure man,’ that the princes,\nnow-a-days, dukes, and high officials styled him the “Supernatural\nbeing,” and he did not therefore venture to treat him with any\ndisrespect. In the second place, (he knew that) he had paid frequent\nvisits to the mansions, and that he had made the acquaintance of the\nladies and young ladies, so when he heard his present remark he\nsmilingly rejoined. “Do you again make use of such language amongst\nourselves? One word more, and I’ll take that beard of yours, and outroot\nit! Don’t you yet come along with me inside?”",
        "“Hah, hah,” laughed the Taoist Chang aloud, as he followed Chia Chen in.\nChia Chen approached dowager lady Chia. Bending his body he strained a\nlaugh. “Grandfather Chang,” he said, “has come in to pay his respects.”",
        "“Raise him up!” old lady Chia vehemently called out.",
        "Chia Chen lost no time in pulling him to his feet and bringing him over.",
        "The Taoist Chang first indulged in loud laughter. “Oh Buddha of\nunlimited years!” he then observed. “Have you kept all right and in good\nhealth, throughout, venerable Senior? Have all the ladies and young\nladies continued well? I haven’t been for some time to your mansion to\npay my obeisance, but you, my dowager lady, have improved more and\nmore.”",
        "“Venerable Immortal Being!” smiled old lady Chia, “how are you; quite\nwell?”",
        "“Thanks to the ten thousand blessings he has enjoyed from your hands,\"\nrejoined Chang the Taoist, “your servant too continues pretty strong and\nhale. In every other respect, I’ve, after all, been all right; but I\nhave felt much concern about Mr. Pao-yü. Has he been all right all the\ntime? The other day, on the 26th of the fourth moon, I celebrated the\nbirthday of the ’Heaven-Pervading-Mighty-King;’ few people came and\neverything went off right and proper. I told them to invite Mr. Pao to\ncome for a stroll; but how was it they said that he wasn’t at home?”",
        "“It was indeed true that he was away from home,” remarked dowager lady\nChia. As she spoke, she turned her head round and called Pao-yü.",
        "Pao-yü had, as it happened, just returned from outside where he had been\nto make himself comfortable, and with speedy step, he came forward. “My\nrespects to you, grandfather Chang,” he said.",
        "The Taoist Chang eagerly clasped him in his arms and inquired how he was\ngetting on. Turning towards old lady Chia, “Mr. Pao,” he observed, “has\ngrown fatter than ever.”",
        "“Outwardly, his looks,” replied dowager lady Chia, “may be all right,\nbut, inwardly, he is weak. In addition to this, his father presses him\nso much to study that he has again and again managed, all through this\nbullying, to make his child fall sick.”",
        "“The other day,” continued Chang the Taoist, “I went to several places\non a visit, and saw characters written by Mr. Pao and verses composed by\nhim, all of which were exceedingly good; so how is it that his worthy\nfather still feels displeased with him, and maintains that Mr. Pao is\nnot very fond of his books? According to my humble idea, he knows quite\nenough. As I consider Mr. Pao’s face, his bearing, his speech and his\ndeportment,” he proceeded, heaving a sigh, “what a striking resemblance\nI find in him to the former duke of the Jung mansion!” As he uttered\nthese words, tears rolled down his cheeks.",
        "At these words, old lady Chia herself found it hard to control her\nfeelings. Her face became covered with the traces of tears. “Quite so,\"\nshe assented, “I’ve had ever so many sons and grandsons, and not one of\nthem betrayed the slightest resemblance to his grandfather; and this\nPao-yü turns out to be the very image of him!”",
        "“What the former duke of Jung Kuo was like in appearance,” Chang, the\nTaoist went on to remark, addressing himself to Chia Chen, “you\ngentlemen, and your generation, were, of course, needless to say, not in\ntime to see for yourselves; but I fancy that even our Senior master and\nour Master Secundus have but a faint recollection of it.”",
        "This said, he burst into another loud fit of laughter. “The other day,\"\nhe resumed, “I was at some one’s house and there I met a young girl, who\nis this year in her fifteenth year, and verily gifted with a beautiful\nface, and I bethought myself that Mr. Pao must also have a wife found\nfor him. As far as looks, intelligence and mental talents, extraction\nand family standing go, this maiden is a suitable match for him. But as\nI didn’t know what your venerable ladyship would have to say about it,\nyour servant did not presume to act recklessly, but waited until I could\nascertain your wishes before I took upon myself to open my mouth with\nthe parties concerned.”",
        "“Some time ago,” responded dowager lady Chia, “a bonze explained that it\nwas ordained by destiny that this child shouldn’t be married at an early\nage, and that we should put things off until he grew somewhat in years\nbefore anything was settled. But mark my words now. Pay no regard as to\nwhether she be of wealthy and honourable stock or not, the essential\nthing is to find one whose looks make her a fit match for him and then\ncome at once and tell me. For even admitting that the girl is poor, all\nI shall have to do will be to bestow on her a few ounces of silver; but\nfine looks and a sweet temperament are not easy things to come across.”",
        "When she had done speaking, lady Feng was heard to smilingly interpose:\n\"Grandfather Chang, aren’t you going to change the talisman of ’Recorded\nName’ of our daughter? The other day, lucky enough for you, you had\nagain the great cheek to send some one to ask me for some satin of\ngosling-yellow colour. I gave it to you, for had I not, I was afraid\nlest your old face should have been made to feel uneasy.”",
        "“Hah, hah,” roared the Taoist Chang, “just see how my eyes must have\ngrown dim! I didn’t notice that you, my lady, were in here; nor did I\nexpress one word of thanks to you! The talisman of ’Recorded Name’ is\nready long ago. I meant to have sent it over the day before yesterday,\nbut the unforeseen visit of the Empress to perform meritorious deeds\nupset my equilibrium, and made me quite forget it. But it’s still placed\nbefore the gods, and if you will wait I’ll go and fetch it.”",
        "Saying this, he rushed into the main hall. Presently, he returned with a\ntea-tray in hand, on which was spread a deep red satin cover, brocaded\nwith dragons. In this, he presented the charm. Ta Chieh-erh’s nurse took\nit from him.",
        "But just as the Taoist was on the point of taking Ta Chieh-erh in his\nembrace, lady Feng remarked with a smile: “It would have been sufficient\nif you’d carried it in your hand! And why use a tray to lay it on?”",
        "“My hands aren’t clean,” replied the Taoist Chang, “so how could I very\nwell have taken hold of it? A tray therefore made things much cleaner!”",
        "“When you produced that tray just now,” laughed lady Feng, “you gave me\nquite a start; I didn’t imagine that it was for the purpose of bringing\nthe charm in. It really looked as if you were disposed to beg donations\nof us.”",
        "This observation sent the whole company into a violent fit of laughter.\nEven Chia Chen could not suppress a smile.",
        "“What a monkey!” dowager lady Chia exclaimed, turning her head round.\n\"What a monkey you are! Aren’t you afraid of going down to that Hell,\nwhere tongues are cut off?”",
        "“I’ve got nothing to do with any men whatever,” rejoined lady Feng\nlaughing, “and why does he time and again tell me that it’s my bounden\nduty to lay up a store of meritorious deeds; and that if I’m remiss, my\nlife will be short?”",
        "Chang, the Taoist, indulged in further laughter. “I brought out,” he\nexplained, “the tray so as to kill two birds with one stone. It wasn’t,\nhowever, to beg for donations. On the contrary, it was in order to put\nin it the jade, which I meant to ask Mr. Pao to take off, so as to carry\nit outside and let all those Taoist friends of mine, who come from far\naway, as well as my neophytes and the young apprentices, see what it’s\nlike.”",
        "“Well, since that be the case,” added old lady Chia, “why do you, at\nyour age, try your strength by running about the whole day long? Take\nhim at once along and let them see it! But were you to have called him\nin there, wouldn’t it have saved a lot of trouble?”",
        "“Your venerable ladyship,” resumed Chang, the Taoist, “isn’t aware that\nthough I be, to look at, a man of eighty, I, after all, continue, thanks\nto your protection, my dowager lady, quite hale and strong. In the\nsecond place, there are crowds of people in the outer rooms; and the\nsmells are not agreeable. Besides it’s a very hot day and Mr. Pao\ncouldn’t stand the heat as he is not accustomed to it. So were he to\ncatch any disease from the filthy odours, it would be a grave thing!”",
        "After these forebodings old lady Chia accordingly desired Pao-yü to\nunclasp the jade of Spiritual Perception, and to deposit it in the tray.\nThe Taoist, Chang, carefully ensconced it in the folds of the wrapper,\nembroidered with dragons, and left the room, supporting the tray with\nboth his hands.",
        "During this while, dowager lady Chia and the other inmates devoted more\nof their time in visiting the various places. But just as they were on\nthe point of going up the two-storied building, they heard Chia Chen\nshout: “Grandfather Chang has brought back the jade.”",
        "As he spoke, the Taoist Chang was seen advancing up to them, the tray in\nhand. “The whole company,” he smiled, “were much obliged to me. They\nthink Mr. Pao’s jade really lovely! None of them have, however, any\nsuitable gifts to bestow. These are religious articles, used by each of\nthem in propagating the doctrines of Reason, but they’re all only too\nready to give them as congratulatory presents. If, Mr. Pao, you don’t\nfancy them for anything else, just keep them to play with or to give\naway to others.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia, at these words, looked into the tray. She discovered\nthat its contents consisted of gold signets, and jade rings, or\nsceptres, implying: “may you have your wishes accomplished in\neverything,” or “may you enjoy peace and health from year to year;” that\nthe various articles were strung with pearls or inlaid with precious\nstones, worked in jade or mounted in gold; and that they were in all\nfrom thirty to fifty.",
        "“What nonsense you’re talking!” she then exclaimed. “Those people are\nall divines, and where could they have rummaged up these things? But\nwhat need is there for any such presents? He may, on no account, accept\nthem.”",
        "“These are intended as a small token of their esteem,” responded Chang,\nthe Taoist, smiling, “your servant cannot therefore venture to interfere\nwith them. If your venerable ladyship will not keep them, won’t you make\nit patent to them that I’m treated contemptuously, and unlike what one\nshould be, who has joined the order through your household?”",
        "Only when old lady Chia heard these arguments did she direct a servant\nto receive the presents.",
        "“Venerable senior,” Pao-yü smilingly chimed in. “After the reasons\nadvanced by grandfather Chang, we cannot possibly refuse them. But\nalbeit I feel disposed to keep these things, they are of no avail to me;\nso would it not be well were a servant told to carry the tray and to\nfollow me out of doors, that I may distribute them to the poor?",
        "“You are perfectly right in what you say!” smiled dowager lady Chia.",
        "The Taoist Chang, however, went on speedily to use various arguments to\ndissuade him. “Mr. Pao,” he observed, “your intention is, it is true, to\nperform charitable acts; but though you may aver that these things are\nof little value, you’ll nevertheless find among them several articles\nyou might turn to some account. Were you to let the beggars have them,\nwhy they will, first of all, be none the better for them; and, next, it\nwill contrariwise be tantamount to throwing them away! If you want to\ndistribute anything among the poor, why don’t you dole out cash to\nthem?”",
        "“Put them by!” promptly shouted Pao-yü, after this rejoinder, “and when\nevening comes, take a few cash and distribute them.”",
        "These directions given, Chang, the Taoist, retired out of the place.",
        "Dowager lady Chia and her companions thereupon walked upstairs and sat\nin the main part of the building. Lady Feng and her friends adjourned\ninto the eastern part, while the waiting-maids and servants remained in\nthe western portion, and took their turns in waiting on their\nmistresses.",
        "Before long, Chia Chen came back. “The plays,” he announced, “have been\nchosen by means of slips picked out before the god. The first one on the\nlist is the ’Record of the White Snake.’”",
        "“Of what kind of old story does ’the record of the white snake,’ treat?\"\nold lady Chia inquired.",
        "“The story about Han Kao-tsu,” replied Chia Chen, “killing a snake and\nthen ascending the throne. The second play is, ’the Bed covered with\nivory tablets.’”",
        "“Has this been assigned the second place?” asked dowager lady Chia. “Yet\nnever mind; for as the gods will it thus, there is no help than not to\ndemur. But what about the third play?” she went on to inquire.",
        "“The Nan Ko dream is the third,” Chia Chen answered.",
        "This response elicited no comment from dowager lady Chia. Chia Chen\ntherefore withdrew downstairs, and betook himself outside to make\narrangements for the offerings to the gods, for the paper money and\neatables that had to be burnt, and for the theatricals about to begin.\nSo we will leave him without any further allusion, and take up our\nnarrative with Pao-yü.",
        "Seating himself upstairs next to old lady Chia, he called to a\nservant-girl to fetch the tray of presents given to him a short while\nback, and putting on his own trinket of jade, he fumbled about with the\nthings for a bit, and picking up one by one, he handed them to his\ngrandmother to admire. But old lady Chia espied among them a unicorn,\nmade of purplish gold, with kingfisher feathers inserted, and eagerly\nextending her arm, she took it up. “This object,” she smiled, “seems to\nme to resemble very much one I’ve seen worn also by the young lady of\nsome household or other of ours.”",
        "“Senior cousin, Shih Hsiang-yün,” chimed in Pao-ch’ai, a smile playing\non her lips, “has one, but it’s a trifle smaller than this.”",
        "“Is it indeed Yün-erh who has it?” exclaimed old lady Chia.",
        "“Now that she lives in our house,” remarked Pao-yü, “how is it that even\nI haven’t seen anything of it?”",
        "“Cousin Pao-ch’ai,” rejoined T’an Ch’un laughingly, “has the power of\nobservation; no matter what she sees, she remembers.”",
        "Lin Tai-yü gave a sardonic smile. “As far as other matters are\nconcerned,” she insinuated, “her observation isn’t worth speaking of;\nwhere she’s extra-observant is in articles people may wear about their\npersons.”",
        "Pao-chai, upon catching this sneering remark, at once turned her head\nround, and pretended she had not heard. But as soon as Pao-yü learnt\nthat Shih Hsiang-yün possessed a similar trinket, he speedily picked up\nthe unicorn, and hid it in his breast, indulging, at the same time, in\nfurther reflection. Yet, fearing lest people might have noticed that he\nkept back that particular thing the moment he discovered that Shih\nHsiang-yün had one identical with it, he fixed his eyes intently upon\nall around while clutching it. He found however that not one of them was\r\npaying any heed to his movements except Lin Tai-yü, who, while gazing at\nhim was, nodding her head, as if with the idea of expressing her\nadmiration. Pao-yü, therefore, at once felt inwardly ill at ease, and\npulling out his hand, he observed, addressing himself to Tai-yü with an\nassumed smile, “This is really a fine thing to play with; I’ll keep it\nfor you, and when we get back home, I’ll pass a ribbon through it for\nyou to wear.” “I don’t care about it,” said Lin Tai-yü, giving her head\na sudden twist.",
        "“Well,” continued Pao-yü laughingly, “if you don’t like it, I can’t do\notherwise than keep it myself.”",
        "Saying this, he once again thrust it away. But just as he was about to\nopen his lips to make some other observation, he saw Mrs. Yu, the spouse\nof Chia Chen, arrive along with the second wife recently married by Chia\nJung, that is, his mother and her daughter-in-law, to pay their\nobeisance to dowager lady Chia.",
        "“What do you people rush over here for again?” old lady Chia inquired.",
        "“I came here for a turn, simply because I had nothing to do.”",
        "But no sooner was this inquiry concluded than they heard a messenger\nannounce: “that some one had come from the house of general Feng.”",
        "The family of Feng Tzu-ying had, it must be explained, come to learn the\nnews that the inmates of the Chia mansion were offering a thanksgiving\nservice in the temple, and, without loss of time, they got together\npresents of pigs, sheep, candles, tea and eatables and sent them over.\nThe moment lady Feng heard about it she hastily crossed to the main part\nof the two-storied building. “Ai-ya;” she ejaculated, clapping her hands\nand laughing. “I never expected anything of the sort; we merely said\nthat we ladies were coming for a leisurely stroll and people imagined\nthat we were spreading a sumptuous altar with lenten viands and came to\nbring us offerings! But it’s all our old lady’s fault for bruiting it\nabout! Why, we haven’t even got any slips of paper with tips ready.”",
        "She had just finished speaking, when she perceived two matrons, who\nacted as house-keepers in the Feng family, walk upstairs. But before the\nFeng servants could take their leave, presents likewise arrived, in\nquick succession, from Chao, the Vice-President of the Board. In due\ncourse, one lot of visitors followed another. For as every one got wind\nof the fact that the Chia family was having thanksgiving services, and\nthat the ladies were in the temple, distant and close relatives,\nfriends, old friends and acquaintances all came to present their\ncontributions. So much so, that dowager lady Chia began at this juncture\nto feel sorry that she had ever let the cat out of the bag. “This is no\nregular fasting,” she said, “we simply have come for a little change;\nand we should not have put any one to any inconvenience!” Although\ntherefore she was to have remained present all day at the theatrical\nperformance, she promptly returned home soon after noon, and the next\nday she felt very loth to go out of doors again.",
        "“By striking the wall, we’ve also stirred up dust,” lady Feng argued.\n\"Why we’ve already put those people to the trouble so we should only be\ntoo glad to-day to have another outing.”",
        "But as when dowager lady Chia interviewed the Taoist Chang, the previous\nday, he made allusion to Pao-yü and canvassed his engagement, Pao-yü\nexperienced, little as one would have thought it, much secret\ndispleasure during the whole of that day, and on his return home he flew\ninto a rage and abused Chang, the rationalistic priest, for harbouring\ndesigns to try and settle a match for him. At every breath and at every\nword he resolved that henceforward he would not set eyes again upon the\nTaoist Chang. But no one but himself had any idea of the reason that\nactuated him to absent himself. In the next place, Lin Tai-yü began\nalso, on her return the day before, to ail from a touch of the sun, so\ntheir grandmother was induced by these two considerations to remain firm\nin her decision not to go. When lady Feng, however, found that she would\nnot join them, she herself took charge of the family party and set out\non the excursion.",
        "But without descending to particulars, let us advert to Pao-yü. Seeing\nthat Lin Tai-yü had fallen ill, he was so full of solicitude on her\naccount that he even had little thought for any of his meals, and not\nlong elapsed before he came to inquire how she was.",
        "Tai-yü, on her part, gave way to fear lest anything should happen to\nhim, (and she tried to re-assure him). “Just go and look at the plays,\"\nshe therefore replied, “what’s the use of boxing yourself up at home?”",
        "Pao-yü was, however, not in a very happy frame of mind on account of the\nreference to his marriage made by Chang, the Taoist, the day before, so\nwhen he heard Lin Tai-yü’s utterances: “If others don’t understand me;\"\nhe mused, “it’s anyhow excusable; but has she too begun to make fun of\nme?” His heart smarted in consequence under the sting of a mortification\na hundred times keener than he had experienced up to that occasion. Had\nhe been with any one else, it would have been utterly impossible for her\nto have brought into play feelings of such resentment, but as it was no\nother than Tai-yü who spoke the words, the impression produced upon him\nwas indeed different from that left in days gone by, when others\nemployed similar language. Unable to curb his feelings, he\ninstantaneously lowered his face. “My friendship with you has been of no\navail” he rejoined. “But, never mind, patience!”",
        "This insinuation induced Lin Tai-yü to smile a couple of sarcastic\nsmiles. “Yes, your friendship with me has been of no avail,” she\nrepeated; “for how can I compare with those whose manifold qualities\nmake them fit matches for you?”",
        "As soon as this sneer fell on Pao-yü’s ear he drew near to her. “Are you\nby telling me this,” he asked straight to her face, “deliberately bent\nupon invoking imprecations upon me that I should be annihilated by\nheaven and extinguished by earth?”",
        "Lin Tai-yü could not for a time fathom the import of his remarks. “It\nwas,” Pao-yü then resumed, “on account of this very conversation that I\nyesterday swore several oaths, and now would you really make me repeat\nanother one? But were the heavens to annihilate me and the earth to\nextinguish me, what benefit would you derive?”",
        "This rejoinder reminded Tai-yü of the drift of their conversation on the\nprevious day. And as indeed she had on this occasion framed in words\nthose sentiments, which should not have dropped from her lips, she\nexperienced both annoyance and shame, and she tremulously observed: “If\nI entertain any deliberate intention to bring any harm upon you, may I\ntoo be destroyed by heaven and exterminated by earth! But what’s the use\nof all this! I know very well that the allusion to marriage made\nyesterday by Chang, the Taoist, fills you with dread lest he might\ninterfere with your choice. You are inwardly so irate that you come and\ntreat me as your malignant influence.”",
        "Pao-yü, the fact is, had ever since his youth developed a peculiar kind\nof mean and silly propensity. Having moreover from tender infancy grown\nup side by side with Tai-Yü, their hearts and their feelings were in\nperfect harmony. More, he had recently come to know to a great extent\nwhat was what, and had also filled his head with the contents of a\nnumber of corrupt books and licentious stories. Of all the eminent and\nbeautiful girls that he had met too in the families of either distant or\nclose relatives or of friends, not one could reach the standard of Lin\nTai-yü. Hence it was that he commenced, from an early period of his\nlife, to foster sentiments of love for her; but as he could not very\nwell give utterance to them, he felt time and again sometimes elated,\nsometimes vexed, and wont to exhaust every means to secretly subject her\nheart to a test.",
        "Lin Tai-yü happened, on the other hand, to possess in like manner a\nsomewhat silly disposition; and she too frequently had recourse to\nfeigned sentiments to feel her way. And as she began to conceal her true\nfeelings and inclinations and to simply dissimulate, and he to conceal\nhis true sentiments and wishes and to dissemble, the two unrealities\nthus blending together constituted eventually one reality. But it was\nhardly to be expected that trifles would not be the cause of tiffs\nbetween them. Thus it was that in Pao-yü’s mind at this time prevailed\nthe reflection: “that were others unable to read my feelings, it would\nanyhow be excusable; but is it likely that you cannot realise that in my\nheart and in my eyes there is no one else besides yourself. But as you\nwere not able to do anything to dispel my annoyance, but made use,\ninstead, of the language you did to laugh at me, and to gag my mouth,\nit’s evident that though you hold, at every second and at every moment,\na place in my heart, I don’t, in fact, occupy a place in yours.” Such\nwas the construction attached to her conduct by Pao-yü, yet he did not\nhave the courage to tax her with it.",
        "“If, really, I hold a place in your heart,” Lin Tai-yü again reflected,\n\"why do you, albeit what’s said about gold and jade being a fit match,\nattach more importance to this perverse report and think nothing of what\nI say? Did you, when I so often broach the subject of this gold and\njade, behave as if you, verily, had never heard anything about it, I\nwould then have seen that you treat me with preference and that you\ndon’t harbour the least particle of a secret design. But how is it that\nthe moment I allude to the topic of gold and jade, you at once lose all\npatience? This is proof enough that you are continuously pondering over\nthat gold and jade, and that as soon as you hear me speak to you about\nthem, you apprehend that I shall once more give way to conjectures, and\nintentionally pretend to be quite out of temper, with the deliberate\nidea of cajoling me!”",
        "These two cousins had, to all appearances, once been of one and the same\nmind, but the many issues, which had sprung up between them, brought\nabout a contrary result and made them of two distinct minds.",
        "“I don’t care what you do, everything is well,” Pao-yü further argued,\n\"so long as you act up to your feelings; and if you do, I shall be ever\nonly too willing to even suffer immediate death for your sake. Whether\nyou know this or not, doesn’t matter; it’s all the same. Yet were you to\njust do as my heart would have you, you’ll afford me a clear proof that\nyou and I are united by close ties and that you are no stranger to me!”",
        "“Just you mind your own business,” Lin Tai-yü on her side cogitated. “If\nyou will treat me well, I’ll treat you well. And what need is there to\nput an end to yourself for my sake? Are you not aware that if you kill\nyourself, I’ll also kill myself? But this demonstrates that you don’t\nwish me to be near to you, and that you really want that I should be\ndistant to you.”",
        "It will thus be seen that the desire, by which they were both actuated,\nto strive and draw each other close and ever closer became contrariwise\ntransformed into a wish to become more distant. But as it is no easy\ntask to frame into words the manifold secret thoughts entertained by\neither, we will now confine ourselves to a consideration of their\nexternal manner.",
        "The three words “a fine match,” which Pao-yü heard again Lin Tai-yü\npronounce proved so revolting to him that his heart got full of disgust\nand he was unable to give utterance to a single syllable. Losing all\ncontrol over his temper, he snatched from his neck the jade of Spiritual\nPerception and, clenching his teeth, he spitefully dashed it down on the\nfloor. “What rubbishy trash!” he cried. “I’ll smash you to atoms and put\nan end to the whole question!”",
        "The jade, however, happened to be of extraordinary hardness, and did\nnot, after all, sustain the slightest injury from this single fall. When\nPao-yü realised that it had not broken, he forthwith turned himself\nround to get the trinket with the idea of carrying out his design of\nsmashing it, but Tai-yü divined his intention, and soon started crying.\n\"What’s the use of all this!” she demurred, “and why, pray, do you\nbatter that dumb thing about? Instead of smashing it, wouldn’t it be\nbetter for you to come and smash me!”",
        "But in the middle of their dispute, Tzu Chüan, Hsüeh Yen and the other\nmaids promptly interfered and quieted them. Subsequently, however, they\nsaw how deliberately bent Pao-yü was upon breaking the jade, and they\nvehemently rushed up to him to snatch it from his hands. But they failed\nin their endeavours, and perceiving that he was getting more troublesome\nthan he had ever been before, they had no alternative but to go and call\nHsi Jen. Hsi Jen lost no time in running over and succeeded, at length,\nin getting hold of the trinket.",
        "“I’m smashing what belongs to me,” remarked Pao-yü with a cynical smile,\n\"and what has that to do with you people?”",
        "Hsi Jen noticed that his face had grown quite sallow from anger, that\nhis eyes had assumed a totally unusual expression, and that he had never\nhitherto had such a fit of ill-temper and she hastened to take his hand\nin hers and to smilingly expostulate with him. “If you’ve had a tiff\nwith your cousin,” she said, “it isn’t worth while flinging this down!\nHad you broken it, how would her heart and face have been able to bear\nthe mortification?”",
        "Lin Tai-yü shed tears and listened the while to her remonstrances. Yet\nthese words, which so corresponded with her own feelings, made it clear\nto her that Pao-yü could not even compare with Hsi Jen and wounded her\nheart so much more to the quick that she began to weep aloud. But the\nmoment she got so vexed she found it hard to keep down the potion of\nboletus and the decoction, for counter-acting the effects of the sun,\nshe had taken only a few minutes back, and with a retch she brought\neverything up. Tzu Chüan immediately pressed to her side and used her\nhandkerchief to stop her mouth with. But mouthful succeeded mouthful,\nand in no time the handkerchief was soaked through and through.",
        "Hsüeh Yen then approached in a hurry and tapped her on the back.",
        "“You may, of course, give way to displeasure,” Tzu Chüan argued; “but\nyou should, after all, take good care of yourself Miss. You had just\ntaken the medicines and felt the better for them; and here you now begin\nvomitting again; and all because you’ve had a few words with our master\nSecundus. But should your complaint break out afresh how will Mr. Pao\nbear the blow?”",
        "The moment Pao-yü caught this advice, which accorded so thoroughly with\nhis own ideas, he found how little Tai-yü could hold her own with Tzu\nChüan. And perceiving how flushed Tai-yü’s face was, how her temples\nwere swollen, how, while sobbing, she panted; and how, while crying, she\nwas suffused with perspiration, and betrayed signs of extreme weakness,\nhe began, at the sight of her condition, to reproach himself. “I\nshouldn’t,” he reflected, “have bandied words with her; for now that\nshe’s got into this frame of mind, I mayn’t even suffer in her stead!”",
        "The self-reproaches, however, which gnawed his heart made it impossible\nfor him to refrain from tears, much as he fought against them. Hsi Jen\nsaw them both crying, and while attending to Pao-yü, she too unavoidably\nexperienced much soreness of heart. She nevertheless went on rubbing\nPao-yü’s hands, which were icy cold. She felt inclined to advise Pao-yü\nnot to weep, but fearing again lest, in the first place, Pao-yü might be\ninwardly aggrieved, and nervous, in the next, lest she should not be\ndealing rightly by Tai-yü, she thought it advisable that they should all\nhave a good cry, as they might then be able to leave off. She herself\ntherefore also melted into tears. As for Tzu-Chüan, at one time, she\ncleaned the expectorated medicine; at another, she took up a fan and\ngently fanned Tai-yü. But at the sight of the trio plunged in perfect\nsilence, and of one and all sobbing for reasons of their own, grief,\nmuch though she did to struggle against it, mastered her feelings too,\nand producing a handkerchief, she dried the tears that came to her eyes.\nSo there stood four inmates, face to face, uttering not a word and\nindulging in weeping.",
        "Shortly, Hsi Jen made a supreme effort, and smilingly said to Pao-yü:\n\"If you don’t care for anything else, you should at least have shown\nsome regard for those tassels, strung on the jade, and not have wrangled\nwith Miss Lin.”",
        "Tai-yü heard these words, and, mindless of her indisposition, she rushed\nover, and snatching the trinket, she picked up a pair of scissors, lying\nclose at hand, bent upon cutting the tassels. Hsi Jen and Tzu Chüan were\non the point of wresting it from her, but she had already managed to\nmangle them into several pieces.",
        "“I have,” sobbed Tai-yü, “wasted my energies on them for nothing; for he\ndoesn’t prize them. He’s certain to find others to string some more fine\ntassels for him.”",
        "Hsi Jen promptly took the jade. “Is it worth while going on in this\nway!” she cried. “But this is all my fault for having blabbered just now\nwhat should have been left unsaid.”",
        "“Cut it, if you like!” chimed in Pao-yü, addressing himself to Tai-yü.\n\"I will on no account wear it, so it doesn’t matter a rap.”",
        "But while all they minded inside was to create this commotion, they\nlittle dreamt that the old matrons had descried Tai-yü weep bitterly and\nvomit copiously, and Pao-yü again dash his jade on the ground, and that\nnot knowing how far the excitement might not go, and whether they\nthemselves might not become involved, they had repaired in a body to the\nfront, and reported the occurrence to dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang,\ntheir object being to try and avoid being themselves implicated in the\nmatter. Their old mistress and Madame Wang, seeing them make so much of\nthe occurrence as to rush with precipitate haste to bring it to their\nnotice, could not in the least imagine what great disaster might not\nhave befallen them, and without loss of time they betook themselves\ntogether into the garden and came to see what the two cousins were up\nto.",
        "Hsi Jen felt irritated and harboured resentment against Tzu Chüan,\nunable to conceive what business she had to go and disturb their old\nmistress and Madame Wang. But Tzu Chüan, on the other hand, presumed\nthat it was Hsi Jen, who had gone and reported the matter to them, and\nshe too cherished angry feelings towards Hsi Jen.",
        "Dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang walked into the apartment. They found\nPao-yü on one side saying not a word. Lin Tai-yü on the other uttering\nnot a sound. “What’s up again?” they asked. But throwing the whole blame\nupon the shoulders of Hsi Jen and Tzu Chüan, “why is it,” they inquired,\n\"that you were not diligent in your attendance on them. They now start a\nquarrel, and don’t you exert yourselves in the least to restrain them?”",
        "Therefore with obloquy and hard words they rated the two girls for a\ntime in such a way that neither of them could put in a word by way of\nreply, but felt compelled to listen patiently. And it was only after\ndowager lady Chia had taken Pao-yü away with her that things quieted\ndown again.",
        "One day passed. Then came the third of the moon. This was Hsüeh Pan’s\nbirthday, so in their house a banquet was spread and preparations made\nfor a performance; and to these the various inmates of the Chia mansion\nwent. But as Pao-yü had so hurt Tai-yü’s feelings, the two cousins saw\nnothing whatever of each other, and conscience-stricken, despondent and\nunhappy, as he was at this time could he have had any inclination to be\npresent at the plays? Hence it was that he refused to go on the pretext\nof indisposition.",
        "Lin Tai-yü had got, a couple of days back, but a slight touch of the sun\nand naturally there was nothing much the matter with her. When the news\nhowever reached her that he did not intend to join the party, “If with\nhis weakness for wine and for theatricals,” she pondered within herself,\n\"he now chooses to stay away, instead of going, why, that quarrel with\nme yesterday must be at the bottom of it all. If this isn’t the reason,\nwell then it must be that he has no wish to attend, as he sees that I’m\nnot going either. But I should on no account have cut the tassels from\nthat jade, for I feel sure he won’t wear it again. I shall therefore\nhave to string some more on to it, before he puts it on.”",
        "On this account the keenest remorse gnawed her heart.",
        "Dowager lady Chia saw well enough that they were both under the\ninfluence of temper. “We should avail ourselves of this occasion,” she\nsaid to herself, “to go over and look at the plays, and as soon as the\ntwo young people come face to face, everything will be squared.\"\nContrary to her expectations neither of them would volunteer to go. This\nso exasperated their old grandmother that she felt vexed with them. “In\nwhat part of my previous existence could an old sufferer like myself,\"\nshe exclaimed, “have incurred such retribution that my destiny is to\ncome across these two troublesome new-fledged foes! Why, not a single\nday goes by without their being instrumental in worrying my mind! The\nproverb is indeed correct which says: ’that people who are not enemies\nare not brought together!’ But shortly my eyes shall be closed, this\nbreath of mine shall be snapped, and those two enemies will be free to\ncause trouble even up to the very skies; for as my eyes will then loose\ntheir power of vision, and my heart will be void of concern, it will\nreally be nothing to me. But I couldn’t very well stifle this breath of\nlife of mine!”",
        "While inwardly a prey to resentment, she also melted into tears.",
        "These words were brought to the ears of Pao-yü and Tai-yü. Neither of\nthem had hitherto heard the adage: “people who are not enemies are not\nbrought together,” so when they suddenly got to know the line, it seemed\nas if they had apprehended abstraction. Both lowered their heads and\nmeditated on the subtle sense of the saying. But unconsciously a stream\nof tears rolled down their cheeks. They could not, it is true, get a\nglimpse of each other; yet as the one was in the Hsiao Hsiang lodge,\nstanding in the breeze, bedewed with tears, and the other in the I Hung\ncourt, facing the moon and heaving deep sighs, was it not, in fact, a\ncase of two persons living in two distinct places, yet with feelings\nemanating from one and the same heart?",
        "Hsi Jen consequently tendered advice to Pao-yü. “You’re a million times\nto blame,” she said, “it’s you who are entirely at fault! For when some\ntime ago the pages in the establishment, wrangled with their sisters, or\nwhen husband and wife fell out, and you came to hear anything about it,\nyou blew up the lads, and called them fools for not having the heart to\nshow some regard to girls; and now here you go and follow their lead.\nBut to-morrow is the fifth day of the moon, a great festival, and will\nyou two still continue like this, as if you were very enemies? If so,\nour venerable mistress will be the more angry, and she certainly will be\ndriven sick! I advise you therefore to do what’s right by suppressing\nyour spite and confessing your fault, so that we should all be on the\nsame terms as hitherto. You here will then be all right, and so will she\nover there.”",
        "Pao-yü listened to what she had to say; but whether he fell in with her\nviews or not is not yet ascertained; yet if you, reader, choose to know,\nwe will explain in the next chapter.",
        "  Pao-ch’ai avails herself of the excuse afforded her by a fan to\n      administer a couple of raps.\n  While Ch’un Ling traces, in a absent frame of mind, the outlines of\n      the character Ch’iang, a looker-on appears on the scene.",
        "Lin Tai-yü herself, for we will now resume our narrative, was also, ever\nsince her tiff with Pao-yü, full of self-condemnation, yet as she did\nnot see why she should run after him, she continued, day and night, as\ndespondent as she would have been had she lost some thing or other\nbelonging to her.",
        "Tzu Chüan surmised her sentiments. “As regards what happened the other\nday,” she advised her, “you were, after all, Miss, a little too hasty;\nfor if others don’t understand that temperament of Pao-yü’s, have you\nand I, surely, also no idea about it? Besides, haven’t there been\nalready one or two rows on account of that very jade?”",
        "“Ts’ui!” exclaimed Tai-yü. “Have you come, on behalf of others, to find\nfault with me? But how ever was I hasty?”",
        "“Why did you,” smiled Tzu Chüan, “take the scissors and cut that tassel\nwhen there was no good reason for it? So isn’t Pao-yü less to blame than\nyourself, Miss? I’ve always found his behaviour towards you, Miss,\nwithout a fault. It’s all that touchy disposition of yours, which makes\nyou so often perverse, that induces him to act as he does.”",
        "Lin Tai-yü had every wish to make some suitable reply, when she heard\nsome one calling at the door. Tzu Chüan discerned the tone of voice.\n\"This sounds like Pao-yü’s voice,” she smiled. “I expect he’s come to\nmake his apologies.”",
        "“I won’t have any one open the door,” Tai-yü cried at these words.",
        "“Here you are in the wrong again, Miss,” Tzu Chüan observed. “How will\nit ever do to let him get a sunstroke and come to some harm on a day\nlike this, and under such a scorching sun?”",
        "Saying this, she speedily walked out and opened the door. It was indeed\nPao-yü. While ushering him in, she gave him a smile. “I imagined,” she\nsaid, “that you would never again put your foot inside our door, Master\nSecundus. But here you are once more and quite unexpectedly!”",
        "“You have by dint of talking,” Pao-yü laughed, “made much ado of\nnothing; and why shouldn’t I come, when there’s no reason for me to keep\naway? Were I even to die, my spirit too will come a hundred times a day!\nBut is cousin quite well?”",
        "“She is,” replied Tzu Chüan, “physically all right; but, mentally, her\nresentment is not quite over.”",
        "“I understand,” continued Pao-yü with a smile. “But resentment, for\nwhat?”",
        "With this inquiry, he wended his steps inside the apartment. He then\ncaught sight of Lin Tai-yü reclining on the bed in the act of crying.\nTai-yü had not in fact shed a tear, but hearing Pao-yü break in upon\nher, she could not help feeling upset. She found it impossible therefore\nto prevent her tears from rolling down her cheeks.",
        "Pao-yü assumed a smiling expression and drew near the bed. “Cousin, are\nyou quite well again?” he inquired.",
        "Tai-yü simply went on drying her tears, and made no reply of any kind.",
        "Pao-yü approached the bed, and sat on the edge of it. “I know,” he\nsmiled, “that you’re not vexed with me. But had I not come, third\nparties would have been allowed to notice my absence, and it would have\nappeared to them as if we had had another quarrel. And had I to wait\nuntil they came to reconcile us, would we not by that time become\nperfect strangers? It would be better, supposing you wish to beat me or\nblow me up, that you should please yourself and do so now; but whatever\nyou do, don’t give me the cold shoulder!”",
        "Continuing, he proceeded to call her “my dear cousin” for several tens\nof times.",
        "Tai-yü had resolved not to pay any more heed to Pao-yü. When she,\nhowever, now heard Pao-yü urge: “don’t let us allow others to know\nanything about our having had a quarrel, as it will look as if we had\nbecome thorough strangers,” it once more became evident to her, from\nthis single remark, that she was really dearer and nearer to him than\nany of the other girls, so she could not refrain from saying sobbingly:\n\"You needn’t have come to chaff me! I couldn’t presume henceforward to\nbe on friendly terms with you, Master Secundus! You should treat me as\nif I were gone!”",
        "At these words, Pao-yü gave way to laughter. “Where are you off to?” he\ninquired.",
        "“I’m going back home,” answered Tai-yü.",
        "“I’ll go along with you then,” smiled Pao-yü.",
        "“But if I die?” asked Tai-yü.",
        "“Well, if you die,” rejoined Pao-yü, “I’ll become a bonze.”",
        "The moment Tai-yü caught this reply, she hung down her head. “You must,\nI presume, be bent upon dying?” she cried. “But what stuff and nonsense\nis this you’re talking? You’ve got so many beloved elder and younger\ncousins in your family, and how many bodies will you have to go and\nbecome bonzes, when by and bye they all pass away! But to-morrow I’ll\ntell them about this to judge for themselves what your motives are!”",
        "Pao-yü was himself aware of the fact that this rejoinder had been\nrecklessly spoken, and he was seized with regret. His face immediately\nbecame suffused with blushes. He lowered his head and had not the\ncourage to utter one word more. Fortunately, however, there was no one\npresent in the room.",
        "Tai-yü stared at him for ever so long with eyes fixed straight on him,\nbut losing control over her temper, “Ai!” she shouted, “can’t you\nspeak?” Then when she perceived Pao-yü reduced to such straits as to\nturn purple, she clenched her teeth and spitefully gave him, on the\nforehead, a fillip with her finger. “Heug!” she cried gnashing her\nteeth, “you, this......” But just as she had pronounced these two words,\nshe heaved another sigh, and picking up her handkerchief, she wiped her\ntears.",
        "Pao-yü treasured at one time numberless tender things in his mind, which\nhe meant to tell her, but feeling also, while he smarted under the sting\nof self-reproach (for the indiscretion he had committed), Tai-yü give\nhim a rap, he was utterly powerless to open his lips, much though he may\nhave liked to speak, so he kept on sighing and snivelling to himself.\nWith all these things therefore to work upon his feelings, he\nunwillingly melted into tears. He tried to find his handkerchief to dry\nhis face with, but unexpectedly discovering that he had again forgotten\nto bring one with him, he was about to make his coat-sleeve answer the\npurpose, when Tai-yü, albeit her eyes were watery, noticed at a glance\nthat he was going to use the brand-new coat of grey coloured gauze he\nwore, and while wiping her own, she turned herself round, and seized a\nsilk kerchief thrown over the pillow, and thrust it into Pao-yü’s lap.\nBut without saying a word, she screened her face and continued sobbing.",
        "Pao-yü saw the handkerchief she threw, and hastily snatching it, he\nwiped his tears. Then drawing nearer to her, he put out his hand and\nclasped her hand in his, and smilingly said to her: “You’ve completely\nlacerated my heart, and do you still cry? But let’s go; I’ll come along\nwith you and see our venerable grandmother.”",
        "Tai-yü thrust his hand aside. “Who wants to go hand in hand with you?\"\nshe cried. “Here we grow older day after day, but we’re still so full of\nbrazen-faced effrontery that we don’t even know what right means?”",
        "But scarcely had she concluded before she heard a voice say aloud:\n\"They’re all right!”",
        "Pao-yü and Tai-yü were little prepared for this surprise, and they were\nstartled out of their senses. Turning round to see who it was, they\ncaught sight of lady Feng running in, laughing and shouting. “Our old\nlady,” she said, “is over there, giving way to anger against heaven and\nearth. She would insist upon my coming to find out whether you were\nreconciled or not. ’There’s no need for me to go and see,’ I told her,\n’they will before the expiry of three days, be friends again of their\nown accord.’ Our venerable ancestor, however, called me to account, and\nmaintained that I was lazy; so here I come! But my words have in very\ndeed turned out true. I don’t see why you two should always be\nwrangling! For three days you’re on good terms and for two on bad. You\nbecome more and more like children. And here you are now hand in hand\nblubbering! But why did you again yesterday become like black-eyed\nfighting cocks? Don’t you yet come with me to see your grandmother and\nmake an old lady like her set her mind at ease a bit?”",
        "While reproaching them, she clutched Tai-yü’s hand and was trudging\naway, when Tai-yü turned her head round and called out for her\nservant-girls. But not one of them was in attendance.",
        "“What do you want them for again?” lady Feng asked. “I am here to wait\non you!”",
        "Still speaking, she pulled her along on their way, with Pao-yü following\nin their footsteps. Then making their exit out of the garden gate, they\nentered dowager lady Chia’s suite of rooms. “I said that it was\nsuperfluous for any one to trouble,” lady Feng smiled, “as they were\nsure of themselves to become reconciled; but you, dear ancestor, so\nlittle believed it that you insisted upon my going to act the part of\nmediator. Yet when I got there, with the intention of inducing them to\nmake it up, I found them, though one did not expect it, in each other’s\ncompany, confessing their faults, and laughing and chatting. Just like a\nyellow eagle clutching the feet of a kite were those two hanging on to\neach other. So where was the necessity for any one to go?”",
        "These words evoked laughter from every one in the room. Pao-ch’ai,\nhowever, was present at the time so Lin Tai-yü did not retort, but went\nand ensconced herself in a seat near her grandmother.",
        "When Pao-yü noticed that no one had anything to say, he smilingly\naddressed himself to Pao-ch’ai. “On cousin Hsüeh P’an’s birth-day,” he\nremarked, “I happened again to be unwell, so not only did I not send him\nany presents, but I failed to go and knock my head before him. Yet\ncousin knows nothing about my having been ill, and it will seem to him\nthat I had no wish to go, and that I brought forward excuses so as to\navoid paying him a visit. If to-morrow you find any leisure, cousin, do\ntherefore explain matters for me to him.”",
        "“This is too much punctiliousness!” smiled Pao-ch’ai. “Even had you\ninsisted upon going, we wouldn’t have been so arrogant as to let you put\nyourself to the trouble, and how much less when you were not feeling\nwell? You two are cousins and are always to be found together the whole\nday; if you encourage such ideas, some estrangement will, after all,\narise between you.”",
        "“Cousin,” continued Pao-yü smilingly, “you know what to say; and so long\nas you’re lenient with me all will be all right. But how is it,” he went\non to ask, “that you haven’t gone over to see the theatricals?”",
        "“I couldn’t stand the heat” rejoined Pao-ch’ai. “I looked on while two\nplays were being sung, but I found it so intensely hot, that I felt\nanxious to retire. But the visitors not having dispersed, I had to give\nas an excuse that I wasn’t feeling up to the mark, and so came away at\nonce.”",
        "Pao-yü, at these words, could not but feel ill at ease. All he could do\nwas to feign another smile. “It’s no wonder,” he observed, “that they\ncompare you, cousin, to Yang Kuei-fei; for she too was fat and afraid of\nhot weather.”",
        "Hearing this, Pao-ch’ai involuntarily flew into a violent rage. Yet when\nabout to call him to task, she found that it would not be nice for her\nto do so. After some reflection, the colour rushed to her cheeks.\nSmiling ironically twice, “I may resemble,” she said, “Yang Kuei-fei,\nbut there’s not one of you young men, whether senior or junior, good\nenough to play the part of Yang Kuo-chung.”",
        "While they were bandying words, a servant-girl Ch’ing Erh, lost sight of\nher fan and laughingly remarked to Pao-ch’ai: “It must be you, Miss Pao,\nwho have put my fan away somewhere or other; dear mistress, do let me\nhave it!”",
        "“You’d better be mindful!” rejoined Pao-ch’ai, shaking her finger at\nher. “With whom have I ever been up to jokes, that you come and suspect\nme? Have I hitherto laughed and smirked with you? There’s that whole lot\nof girls, go and ask them about it!”",
        "At this suggestion, Ch’ing Erh made her escape.",
        "The consciousness then burst upon Pao-yü, that he had again been\ninconsiderate in his speech, in the presence of so many persons, and he\nwas overcome by a greater sense of shame than when, a short while back,\nhe had been speaking with Lin Tai-yü. Precipitately turning himself\nround, he went, therefore, and talked to the others as well.",
        "The sight of Pao-yü poking fun at Pao-ch’ai gratified Tai-yü immensely.\nShe was just about to put in her word and also seize the opportunity of\nchaffing her, but as Ch’ing Erh unawares asked for her fan and Pao-ch’ai\nadded a few more remarks, she at once changed her purpose. “Cousin\nPao-ch’ai,” she inquired, “what two plays did you hear?”",
        "Pao-ch’ai caught the expression of gratification in Tai-yü’s\ncountenance, and concluded that she had for a certainty heard the\nraillery recently indulged in by Pao-yü and that it had fallen in with\nher own wishes; and hearing her also suddenly ask the question she did,\nshe answered with a significant laugh: “What I saw was: ’Li Kuei blows\nup Sung Chiang and subsequently again tenders his apologies’.”",
        "Pao-yü smiled. “How is it,” he said, “that with such wide knowledge of\nthings new as well as old; and such general information as you possess,\nyou aren’t even up to the name of a play, and that you’ve come out with\nsuch a whole string of words. Why, the real name of the play is:\n’Carrying a birch and begging for punishment’”.",
        "“Is it truly called: ’Carrying a birch and begging for punishment’”?\nPao-ch’ai asked with laugh. “But you people know all things new and old\nso are able to understand the import of ’carrying a birch and begging\nfor punishment.’ As for me I’ve no idea whatever what ’carrying a birch\nand begging for punishment’ implies.”",
        "One sentence was scarcely ended when Pao-yü and Tai-yü felt guilty in\ntheir consciences; and by the time they heard all she said, they were\nquite flushed from shame. Lady Feng did not, it is true, fathom the gist\nof what had been said, but at the sight of the expression betrayed on\nthe faces of the three cousins, she readily got an inkling of it. “On\nthis broiling hot day,” she inquired laughing also; “who still eats raw\nginger?”",
        "None of the party could make out the import of her insinuation. “There’s\nno one eating raw ginger,” they said.",
        "Lady Feng intentionally then brought her hands to her cheeks, and\nrubbing them, she remarked with an air of utter astonishment, “Since\nthere’s no one eating raw ginger, how is it that you are all so fiery in\nthe face?”",
        "Hearing this, Pao-yü and Tai-yü waxed more uncomfortable than ever. So\nmuch so, that Pao-ch’ai, who meant to continue the conversation, did not\nthink it nice to say anything more when she saw how utterly abashed\nPao-yü was and how changed his manner. Her only course was therefore to\nsmile and hold her peace. And as the rest of the inmates had not the\nfaintest notion of the drift of the remarks exchanged between the four\nof them, they consequently followed her lead and put on a smile.",
        "In a short while, however, Pao-ch’ai and lady Feng took their leave.",
        "“You’ve also tried your strength with them,” Tai-yü said to Pao-yü\nlaughingly. “But they’re far worse than I. Is every one as simple in\nmind and dull of tongue as I am as to allow people to say whatever they\nlike.”",
        "Pao-yü was inwardly giving way to that unhappiness, which had been\noccasioned by Pao-ch’ai’s touchiness, so when he also saw Tai-yü\napproach him and taunt him, displeasure keener than ever was aroused in\nhim. A desire then asserted itself to speak out his mind to her, but\ndreading lest Tai-yü should he in one of her sensitive moods, he,\nneedless to say, stifled his anger and straightway left the apartment in\na state of mental depression.",
        "It happened to be the season of the greatest heat. Breakfast time too\nwas already past, and masters as well as servants were, for the most\npart, under the influence of the lassitude felt on lengthy days. As\nPao-yü therefore strolled, from place to place, his hands behind his\nback he heard not so much as the caw of a crow. Issuing out of his\ngrandmother’s compound on the near side, he wended his steps westwards,\nand crossed the passage, on which lady Feng’s quarters gave. As soon as\nhe reached the entrance of her court, he perceived the door ajar. But\naware of lady Feng’s habit of taking, during the hot weather, a couple\nof hours’ siesta at noon, he did not feel it a convenient moment to\nintrude. Walking accordingly through the corner door, he stepped into\nMadame Wang’s apartment. Here he discovered several waiting-maids,\ndosing with their needlework clasped in their hands. Madame Wang was\nasleep on the cool couch in the inner rooms. Chin Ch’uan-erh was sitting\nnext to her massaging her legs. But she too was quite drowsy, and her\neyes wore all awry. Pao-yü drew up to her with gentle tread. The moment,\nhowever, that he unfastened the pendants from the earrings she wore,\nChin Ch’uan opened her eyes, and realised that it was no one than\nPao-yü.",
        "“Are you feeling so worn out!” he smilingly remarked in a low tone of\nvoice.",
        "Chin Ch’uan pursed up her lips and gave him a smile. Then waving her\nhand so as to bid him quit the room, she again closed her eyes.",
        "Pao-yü, at the sight of her, felt considerable affection for her and\nunable to tear himself away, so quietly stretching his head forward, and\nnoticing that Madame Wang’s eyes were shut, he extracted from a purse,\nsuspended about his person, one of the ’scented-snow-for-moistening-mouth\npills,’ with which it was full, and placed it on Chin Ch’uan-erh’s lips.\nChin Ch’uan-erh, however, did not open her eyes, but simply held (the\npill) in her mouth. Pao-yü then approached her and took her hand in his.\n\"I’ll ask you of your mistress,” he gently observed smiling, “and you and\nI will live \u0016together.”",
        "To this Chin Ch’uan-erh said not a word.",
        "“If that won’t do,” Pao-yü continued, “I’ll wait for your mistress to\nwake and appeal to her at once.”",
        "Chin Ch’uan-erh distended her eyes wide, and pushed Pao-yü off. “What’s\nthe hurry?” she laughed. “’A gold hair-pin may fall into the well; but\nif it’s yours it will remain yours only.’ Is it possible that you don’t\neven see the spirit of this proverb? But I’ll tell you a smart thing.\nJust you go into the small court, on the east side, and you’ll find for\nyourself what Mr. Chia Huau and Ts’ai Yun are up to!”",
        "“Let them be up to whatever they like,” smiled Pao-yü, “I shall simply\nstick to your side!”",
        "But he then saw Madame Wang twist herself round, get up, and give a slap\nto Chin Ch’uan-erh on her mouth. “You mean wench!” she exclaimed,\nabusing her, while she pointed her finger at her, “it’s you, and the\nlike of you, who corrupt these fine young fellows with all the nice\nthings you teach them!”",
        "The moment Pao-yü perceived Madame Wang rise, he bolted like a streak of\nsmoke. Chin Ch’uan-erh, meanwhile, felt half of her face as hot as fire,\nyet she did not dare utter one word of complaint. The various\nwaiting-maids soon came to hear that Madame Wang had awoke and they\nrushed in in a body.",
        "“Go and tell your mother,” Madame Wang thereupon said to Yü Ch’uan-erh,\n\"to fetch your elder sister away.”",
        "Chin Ch’uan-erh, at these words, speedily fell on her knees. With tears\nin her eyes: “I won’t venture to do it again,” she pleaded. “If you,\nMadame, wish to flog me, or to scold me do so at once, and as much as\nyou like but don’t send me away. You will thus accomplish an act of\nheavenly grace! I’ve been in attendance on your ladyship for about ten\nyears, and if you now drive me away, will I be able to look at any one\nin the face?”",
        "Though Madame Wang was a generous, tender-hearted person, and had at no\ntime raised her hand to give a single blow to any servant-girl, she,\nhowever, when she accidentally discovered Chin Ch’uan-erh behave on this\noccasion in this barefaced manner, a manner which had all her lifetime\nbeen most reprehensible to her, was so overcome by passion that she gave\nChin Ch’uan-erh just one slap and spoke to her a few sharp words. And\nalbeit Chin Ch’uan-erh indulged in solicitous entreaties, she would not\non any account keep her in her service. At length, Chin Ch’uan-erh’s\nmother, Dame Pao, was sent for to take her away. Chin Ch’uan-erh\ntherefore had to conceal her disgrace, suppress her resentment, and quit\nthe mansion.",
        "But without any further reference to her, we will now take up our story\nwith Pao-yü. As soon as he saw Madame Wang awake, his spirits were\ncrushed. All alone he hastily made his way into the Ta Kuan garden. Here\nhis attention was attracted by the ruddy sun, shining in the zenith, the\nshade of the trees extending far and wide, the song of the cicadas,\nfilling the ear; and by a perfect stillness, not even broken by the echo\nof a human voice. But the instant he got near the trellis, with the\ncinnamon roses, the sound of sobs fell on his ear. Doubts and surmises\ncrept into Pao-yü’s mind, so halting at once, he listened with\nintentness. Then actually he discerned some one on the off-side of the\ntrellis. This was the fifth moon, the season when the flowers and\nfoliage of the cinnamon roses were in full bloom. Furtively peeping\nthrough an aperture in the fence, Pao-yü saw a young girl squatting\nunder the flowers and digging the ground with a hair-pin she held in her\nhand. As she dug, she silently gave way to tears.",
        "“Can it be possible,” mused Pao-yü, “that this girl too is stupid? Can\nshe also be following P’in Erh’s example and come to inter flowers? Why\nif she’s likewise really burying flowers,” he afterwards went on to\nsmilingly reflect, “this can aptly be termed: ’Tung Shih tries to\nimitate a frown.’ But not only is what she does not original, but it is\ndespicable to boot. You needn’t,” he meant to shout out to the girl, at\nthe conclusion of this train of thought, “try and copy Miss Lin’s\nexample.” But before the words had issued from his mouth, he luckily\nscrutinised her a second time, and found that the girl’s features were\nquite unfamiliar to him, that she was no menial, and that she looked\nlike one of the twelve singing maids, who were getting up the plays. He\ncould not, however, make out what rôles she filled: scholars,\ngirls, old men, women, or buffoons. Pao-yü quickly put out his tongue\nand stopped his mouth with his hand. “How fortunate,” he inwardly\nsoliloquised, “that I didn’t make any reckless remark! It was all\nbecause of my inconsiderate talk on the last two occasions, that P’in\nErh got angry with me, and that Pao-ch’ai felt hurt. And had I now given\nthem offence also, I would have been in a still more awkward fix!”",
        "While wrapt in these thoughts, he felt much annoyance at not being able\nto recognise who she was. But on further minute inspection, he noticed\nthat this maiden, with contracted eyebrows, as beautiful as the hills in\nspring, frowning eyes as clear as the streams in autumn, a face, with\ntransparent skin, and a slim waist, was elegant and beautiful and almost\nthe very image of Lin Tai-yü. Pao-yü could not, from the very first,\nmake up his mind to wrench himself away. But as he stood gazing at her\nin a doltish mood, he realised that, although she was tracing on the\nground with the gold hair-pin, she was not digging a hole to bury\nflowers in, but was merely delineating characters on the surface of the\nsoil. Pao-yü’s eyes followed the hair-pin from first to last, as it went\nup and as it came down. He watched each dash, each dot and each hook. He\ncounted the strokes. They numbered eighteen. He himself then set to work\nand sketched with his finger on the palm of his hand, the lines, in\ntheir various directions, and in the order they had been traced a few\nminutes back, so as to endeavour to guess what the character was. On\ncompleting the sketch, he discovered, the moment he came to reflect,\nthat it was the character “Ch’iang,” in the combination, ’Ch’iang Wei,’\nrepresenting cinnamon roses.",
        "“She too,” pondered Pao-yü, “must have been bent upon writing verses, or\nsupplying some line or other, and at the sight now of the flowers, the\nidea must have suggested itself to her mind. Or it may very likely be\nthat having spontaneously devised a couplet, she got suddenly elated and\nbegan, for fear it should slip from her memory, to trace it on the\nground so as to tone the rhythm. Yet there’s no saying. Let me see,\nhowever, what she’s going to write next.”",
        "While cogitating, he looked once more. Lo, the girl was still tracing.\nBut tracing up or tracing down, it was ever the character “Ch’iang.\"\nWhen he gazed again, it was still the self-same Ch’iang.",
        "The one inside the fence fell, in fact, from an early stage, into a\nfoolish mood, and no sooner was one ’Ch’iang,’ finished than she started\nwith another; so that she had already written several tens of them. The\none outside gazed and gazed, until he unwittingly also got into the same\nfoolish mood. Intent with his eyes upon following the movements of the\npin, in his mind, he communed thus with his own thoughts: “This girl\nmust, for a certainty, have something to say, or some unspeakable\nmomentous secret that she goes on like this. But if outwardly she\nbehaves in this wise, who knows what anguish she mayn’t suffer at heart?\nAnd yet, with a frame to all appearances so very delicate, how could she\never resist much inward anxiety! Woe is me that I’m unable to transfer\nsome part of her burden on to my own shoulders!”",
        "In midsummer, cloudy and bright weather are uncertain. A few specks of\nclouds suffice to bring about rain. Of a sudden, a cold blast swept by,\nand tossed about by the wind fell a shower of rain. Pao-yü perceived\nthat the water trickling down the girl’s head saturated her gauze attire\nin no time. “It’s pouring,” Pao-yü debated within himself, “and how can\na frame like hers resist the brunt of such a squall.” Unable therefore\nto restrain himself, he vehemently shouted: “Leave off writing! See,\nit’s pouring; you’re wet through!”",
        "The girl caught these words, and was frightened out of her wits. Raising\nher head, she at once descried some one or other standing beyond the\nflowers and calling out to her: “Leave off writing. It’s pouring!” But\nas Pao-yü was, firstly, of handsome appearance, and as secondly the\nluxuriant abundance of flowers and foliage screened with their boughs,\nthick-laden with leaves, the upper and lower part of his person, just\nleaving half of his countenance exposed to view, the maiden simply\njumped at the conclusion that he must be a servant girl, and never for a\nmoment dreamt that it might be Pao-yü. “Many thanks, sister, for\nrecalling me to my senses,” she consequently smiled. “Yet is there\nforsooth anything outside there to protect you from the rain?”",
        "This single remark proved sufficient to recall Pao-yü to himself. With\nan exclamation of “Ai-yah,” he at length became conscious that his whole\nbody was cold as ice. Then drooping his head, he realised that his own\nperson too was drenched. “This will never do,” he cried, and with one\nbreath he had to run back into the I Hung court. His mind, however,\ncontinued much exercised about the girl as she had nothing to shelter\nher from the rain.",
        "As the next day was the dragon-boat festival, Wen Kuan and the other\nsinging girls, twelve in all, were given a holiday, so they came into\nthe garden and amused themselves by roaming everywhere and anywhere. As\nluck would have it, the two girls Pao-Kuan, who filled the rôleof young men and Yü Kuan, who represented young women, were in the I\nHung court enjoying themselves with Hsi Jen, when rain set in and they\nwere prevented from going back, so in a body they stopped up the drain\nto allow the water to accumulate in the yard. Then catching those that\ncould be caught, and driving those that had to be driven, they laid hold\nof a few of the green-headed ducks, variegated marsh-birds and coloured\nmandarin-ducks, and tying their wings they let them loose in the court\nto disport themselves. Closing the court Hsi Jen and her playmates stood\ntogether under the verandah and enjoyed the fun. Pao-yü therefore found\nthe entrance shut. He gave a rap at the door. But as every one inside\nwas bent upon laughing, they naturally did not catch the sound; and it\nwas only after he had called and called, and made a noise by thumping at\nthe door, that they at last heard. Imagining, however, that Pao-yü could\nnot be coming back at that hour, Hsi Jen shouted laughing: “who’s it now\nknocking at the door? There’s no one to go and open.”",
        "“It’s I,” rejoined Pao-yü.",
        "“It’s Miss Pao-ch’ai’s tone of voice,” added She Yüeh.",
        "“Nonsense!” cried Ch’ing Wen. “What would Miss Pao-ch’ai come over to do\nat such an hour?”",
        "“Let me go,” chimed in Hsi Jen, “and see through the fissure in the\ndoor, and if we can open, we’ll open; for we mustn’t let her go back,\nwet through.”",
        "With these words, she came along the passage to the doorway. On looking\nout, she espied Pao-yü dripping like a chicken drenched with rain.",
        "Seeing him in this plight, Hsi Jen felt solicitous as well as amused.\nWith alacrity, she flung the door wide open, laughing so heartily that\nshe was doubled in two. “How could I ever have known,” she said,\nclapping her hands, “that you had returned, Sir! Yet how is it that\nyou’ve run back in this heavy rain?”",
        "Pao-yü had, however, been feeling in no happy frame of mind. He had\nfully resolved within himself to administer a few kicks to the person,\nwho came to open the door, so as soon as it was unbarred, he did not try\nto make sure who it was, but under the presumption that it was one of\nthe servant-girls, he raised his leg and give her a kick on the side.",
        "“Ai-yah!” ejaculated Hsi Jen.",
        "Pao-yü nevertheless went on to abuse. “You mean things!” he shouted.\n\"It’s because I’ve always treated you so considerately that you don’t\nrespect me in the least! And you now go to the length of making a\nlaughing-stock of me!”",
        "As he spoke, he lowered his head. Then catching sight of Hsi Jen, in\ntears, he realised that he had kicked the wrong person. “Hallo!” he\nsaid, promptly smiling, “is it you who’ve come? Where did I kick you?”",
        "Hsi Jen had never, previous to this, received even a harsh word from\nhim. When therefore she on this occasion unexpectedly saw Pao-yü gave\nher a kick in a fit of anger and, what made it worse, in the presence of\nso many people, shame, resentment, and bodily pain overpowered her and\nshe did not, in fact, for a time know where to go and hide herself. She\nwas then about to give rein to her displeasure, but the reflection that\nPao-yü could not have kicked her intentionally obliged her to suppress\nher indignation. “Instead of kicking,” she remarked, “don’t you yet go\nand change your clothes?”",
        "Pao-yü walked into the room. As he did so, he smiled. “Up to the age\nI’ve reached,” he observed, “this is the first instance on which I’ve\never so thoroughly lost control over my temper as to strike any one;\nand, contrary to all my thoughts, it’s you that happened to come in my\nway?”",
        "Hsi Jen, while patiently enduring the pain, effected the necessary\nchange in his attire. “I’ve been here from the very first,” she\nsimultaneously added, smilingly, “so in all things, whether large or\nsmall, good or bad, it has naturally fallen to my share to bear the\nbrunt. But not to say another word about your assault on me, why,\nto-morrow you’ll indulge your hand and star-beating others!”",
        "“I did not strike you intentionally just now,” retorted Pao-yü.",
        "“Who ever said,” rejoined Hsi Jen, “that you did it intentionally! It\nhas ever been the duty of that tribe of servant-girls to open and shut\nthe doors, yet they’ve got into the way of being obstinate, and have\nlong ago become such an abomination that people’s teeth itch to revenge\nthemselves on them. They don’t know, besides, what fear means. So had\nyou first assured yourself that it was they and given them a kick, a\nlittle intimidating would have done them good. But I’m at the bottom of\nthe mischief that happened just now, for not calling those, upon whom it\ndevolves, to come and open for you.”",
        "During the course of their conversation, the rain ceased, and Pao Kuan\nand Yü Kuan had been able to take their leave. Hsi Jen, however,\nexperienced such intense pain in her side, and felt such inward\nvexation, that at supper she could not put a morsel of anything in her\nmouth. When in the evening, the time came for her to have her bath, she\ndiscovered, on divesting herself of her clothes, a bluish bruise on her\nside of the size of a saucer and she was very much frightened. But as\nshe could not very well say anything about it to any one, she presently\nretired to rest. But twitches of pain made her involuntarily moan in her\ndreams and groan in her sleep.",
        "Pao-yü did, it is true, not hurt her with any malice, but when he saw\nHsi Jen so listless and restless, and suddenly heard her groan in the\ncourse of the night, he realised how severely he must have kicked her.\nSo getting out of bed, he gently seized the lantern and came over to\nlook at her. But as soon as he reached the side of her bed, he perceived\nHsi Jen expectorate, with a retch, a whole mouthful of phlegm. “Oh me!\"\nshe gasped, as she opened her eyes. The presence of Pao-yü startled her\nout of her wits. “What are you up to?” she asked.",
        "“You groaned in your dreams,” answered Pao-yü, “so I must have kicked\nyou hard. Do let me see!”",
        "“My head feels giddy,” said Hsi Jen. “My throat foul and sweet; throw\nthe light on the floor!”",
        "At these words, Pao-yü actually raised the lantern. The moment he cast\nthe light below, he discerned a quantity of fresh blood on the floor.",
        "Pao-yü was seized with consternation. “Dreadful!” was all he could say.\nAt the sight of the blood, Hsi Jen’s heart too partly waxed cold.",
        "But, reader, the next chapter will reveal the sequel, if you really have\nany wish to know more about them.",
        "  Pao-yü allows the girl Ch’ing Wen to tear his fan so as to afford her\n      amusement.\n  A wedding proves to be the result of the descent of a unicorn.",
        "But to proceed. When she saw on the floor the blood, she had brought up,\nHsi Jen immediately grew partly cold. What she had often heard people\nmention in past days ’that the lives of young people, who expectorate\nblood, are uncertain, and that although they may live long, they are,\nafter all, mere wrecks,’ flashed through her mind. The remembrance of\nthis saying at once completely scattered to the winds the wish, she had\nall along cherished, of striving for honour and of being able to boast\nof glory; and from her eyes unwittingly ran down streams of tears.",
        "When Pao-yü saw her crying, his heart was seized with anguish. “What’s\nit that preys on your mind?” he consequently asked her.",
        "Hsi Jen strained every nerve to smile. “There’s no rhyme or reason for\nanything,” she replied, “so what can it be?”",
        "Pao-yü’s intention was to there and then give orders to the servant to\nwarm some white wine and to ask them for a few ’Li-T’ung’ pills\ncompounded with goat’s blood, but Hsi Jen clasped his hand tight. “My\ntroubling you is of no matter,” she smiled, “but were I to put ever so\nmany people to inconvenience, they’ll bear me a grudge for my impudence.\nNot a soul, it’s clear enough, knows anything about it now, but were you\nto make such a bustle as to bring it to people’s notice, you’ll be in an\nawkward fix, and so will I. The proper thing, therefore, is for you to\nsend a page to-morrow to request Dr. Wang to prepare some medicine for\nme. When I take this I shall be all right. And as neither any human\nbeing nor spirit will thus get wind of it, won’t it be better?”",
        "Pao-yü found her suggestion so full of reason that he thought himself\nobliged to abandon his purpose; so approaching the table, he poured a\ncup of tea, and came over and gave it to Hsi Jen to rinse her mouth\nwith. Aware, however, as Hsi Jen was that Pao-yü himself was not feeling\nat ease in his mind, she was on the point of bidding him not wait upon\nher; but convinced that he would once more be certain not to accede to\nher wishes, and that the others would, in the second place, have to be\ndisturbed, she deemed it expedient to humour him. Leaning on the couch,\nshe consequently allowed Pao-yü to come and attend to her.",
        "As soon as the fifth watch struck, Pao-yü, unmindful of combing or\nwashing, hastily put on his clothes and left the room; and sending for\nWang Chi-jen, he personally questioned him with all minuteness about her\nailment.",
        "Wang Chi-jen asked how it had come about. “It’s simply a bruise; nothing\nmore,” (he said), and forthwith he gave him the names of some pills and\nmedicines, and told him how they were to be taken, and how they were to\nbe applied.",
        "Pao-yü committed every detail to memory, and on his return into the\ngarden, the treatment was, needless for us to explain, taken in hand in\nstrict compliance with the directions.",
        "This was the day of the dragon-boat festival. Cat-tail and artemisia\nwere put over the doors. Tiger charms were suspended on every back. At\nnoon, Madame Wang got a banquet ready, and to this midday feast, she\ninvited the mother, daughter and the rest of the members of the Hsüeh\nhousehold.",
        "Pao-yü noticed that Pao-ch’ai was in such low spirits that she would not\neven speak to him, and concluded that the reason was to be sought in the\nincident of the previous day. Madame Wang seeing Pao-yü in a sullen\nhumour jumped at the surmise that it must be due to Chin Ch’uan’s affair\nof the day before; and so ill at ease did she feel that she heeded him\nless than ever. Lin Tai-yü, detected Pao-yü’s apathy, and presumed that\nhe was out of sorts for having given umbrage to Pao-ch’ai, and her\nmanner likewise assumed a listless air. Lady Feng had, in the course of\nthe previous evening, been told by Madame Wang what had taken place\nbetween Pao-yü and Chin Ch’uan, and when she came to know that Madame\nWang was in an unhappy frame of mind she herself did not venture to chat\nor laugh, but at once regulated her behaviour to suit Madame Wang’s\nmood. So the lack of animation became more than ever perceptible; for\nthe good cheer of Ying Ch’un and her sisters was also damped by the\nsight of all of them down in the mouth. The natural consequence\ntherefore was that they all left after a very short stay.",
        "Lin Tai-yü had a natural predilection for retirement. She did not care\nfor social gatherings. Her notions, however, were not entirely devoid of\nreason. She maintained that people who gathered together must soon part;\nthat when they came together, they were full of rejoicing, but did they\nnot feel lonely when they broke up? That since this sense of loneliness\ngave rise to chagrin, it was consequently preferable not to have any\ngatherings. That flowers afforded an apt example. When they opened, they\nwon people’s admiration; but when they faded, they added to the feeling\nof vexation; so that better were it if they did not blossom at all! To\nthis cause therefore must be assigned the fact that when other people\nwere glad, she, on the contrary, felt unhappy.",
        "Pao-yü’s disposition was such that he simply yearned for frequent\ngatherings, and looked forward with sorrow to the breaking up which must\ntoo soon come round. As for flowers, he wished them to bloom repeatedly\nand was haunted with the dread of their dying in a little time. Yet\nalbeit manifold anguish fell to his share when banquets drew to a close\nand flowers began to fade, he had no alternative but to practice\nresignation.",
        "On this account was it that, when the company cheerlessly broke up from\nthe present feast, Lin Tai-yü did not mind the separation; and that\nPao-yü experienced such melancholy and depression, that, on his return\nto his apartments, he gave way to deep groans and frequent sighs.",
        "Ch’ing Wen, as it happened, came to the upper quarters to change her\ncostume. In an unguarded moment, she let her fan slip out of her hand\nand drop on the ground. As it fell, the bones were snapped. “You stupid\nthing!” Pao-yü exclaimed, sighing, “what a dunce! what next will you be\nup to by and bye? When, in a little time, you get married and have a\nhome of your own, will you, forsooth, still go on in this happy-go-lucky\ncareless sort of way?”",
        "“Master Secundus,” replied Ch’ing Wen with a sardonic smile, “your\ntemper is of late dreadfully fiery, and time and again it leaks out on\nyour very face! The other day you even beat Hsi Jen and here you are\nagain now finding fault with us! If you feel disposed to kick or strike\nus, you are at liberty, Sir, to do so at your pleasure; but for a fan to\nslip on the ground is an everyday occurrence! How many of those crystal\njars and cornelian bowls were smashed the other time, I don’t remember,\nand yet you were not seen to fly into a tantrum; and now, for a fan do\nyou distress yourself so? What’s the use of it? If you dislike us, well\npack us off and select some good girls to serve you, and we will quietly\ngo away. Won’t this be better?”",
        "This rejoinder so exasperated Pao-yü that his whole frame trembled\nviolently. “You needn’t be in a hurry!” he then shouted. “There will be\na day of parting by and bye.”",
        "Hsi Jen was on the other side, and from an early period she listened to\nthe conversation between them. Hurriedly crossing over, “what are you up\nto again?” she said to Pao-yü, “why, there’s nothing to put your monkey\nup! I’m perfectly right in my assertion that when I’m away for any\nlength of time, something is sure to happen.”",
        "Ch’ing Wen heard these remarks. “Sister,” she interposed smiling\nironically, “since you’ve got the gift of the gab, you should have come\nat once; you would then have spared your master his fit of anger. It’s\nyou who have from bygone days up to the present waited upon master;\nwe’ve never had anything to do with attending on him; and it’s because\nyou’ve served him so faithfully that he repaid you yesterday with a kick\non the stomach. But who knows what punishment mayn’t be in store for us,\nwho aren’t fit to wait upon him decently!”",
        "At these insinuations, Hsi Jen felt both incensed and ashamed. She was\nabout to make some response but Pao-yü had worked himself into such\nanother passion as to get quite yellow in the face, and she was obliged\nto rein in her temper. Pushing Ch’ing Wen, “Dear sister,” she cried,\n\"you had better be off for a stroll! it’s really we, who are to blame!”",
        "The very mention of the word “we” made it certain to Ch’ing Wen that she\nimplied herself and Pao-yü, and thus unawares more fuel was added again\nto her jealous notions. Giving way to several loud smiles, full of\nirony: “I can’t make out,” she insinuated, “who you may mean. But don’t\nmake me blush on your account! Even those devilish pranks of yours can’t\nhoodwink me! How and why is it that you’ve started styling yourself as\n’we?’ Properly speaking, you haven’t as yet so much as attained the\ndesignation of ’Miss!’ You’re simply no better than I am, and how is it\nthen that you presume so high as to call yourself ’we.’”",
        "Hsi Jen’s face grew purple from shame. “The fact is,” she reflected,\n\"that I’ve said more than I should.”",
        "“As one and all of you are ever bearing her malice,” Pao-yü\nsimultaneously observed, “I’ll actually raise her to-morrow to a higher\nstatus!”",
        "Hsi Jen quickly snatched Pao-yü’s hand. “She’s a stupid girl,” she said,\n\"what’s the use of arguing with her? What’s more, you’ve so far borne\nwith them and overlooked ever, so many other things more grievous than\nthis; and what are you up to to-day?”",
        "“If I’m really a stupid girl,” repeated Ch’ing Wen, smiling\nsarcastically, “am I a fit person for you to hold converse with? Why,\nI’m purely and simply a slave-girl; that’s all.”",
        "“Are you, after all,” cried Hsi Jen, at these words, “bickering with me,\nor with Master Secundus? If you bear me a grudge, you’d better then\naddress your remarks to me alone; albeit it isn’t right that you should\nkick up such a hullaballoo in the presence of Mr. Secundus. But if you\nhave a spite against Mr. Secundus, you shouldn’t be shouting so\nboisterously as to make thousands of people know all about it! I came\nin, a few minutes back, merely for the purpose of setting matters right,\nand of urging you to make up your quarrels so that we should all be on\nthe safe side; and here I have the unlucky fate of being set upon by\nyou, Miss! Yet you neither seem to be angry with me, nor with Mr.\nSecundus! But armed cap-à-pie as you appear to be, what is your\nultimate design? I won’t utter another word, but let you have your say!”",
        "While she spoke, she was hurriedly wending her way out.",
        "“You needn’t raise your dander.” Pao-yü remarked to Ch’ing Wen. “I’ve\nguessed the secret of your heart, so I’ll go and tell mother that as\nyou’ve also attained a certain age, she should send you away. Will this\nplease you, yes or no?”",
        "This allusion made Ch’ing Wen unwittingly feel again wounded at heart.\nShe tried to conceal her tears. “Why should I go away?” she asked. “If\neven you be so prejudiced against me as to try and devise means to pack\nme off, you won’t succeed.”",
        "“I never saw such brawling!” Pao-yü exclaimed. “You’re certainly bent\nupon going! I might as well therefore let mother know so as to bundle\nyou off!”",
        "While addressing her, he rose to his feet and was intent upon trudging\noff at once. Hsi Jen lost no time in turning round and impeding his\nprogress. “Where are you off to?” she cried.",
        "“I’m going to tell mother,” answered Pao-yü.",
        "“It’s no use whatever!” Hsi Jen smiled, “you may be in real earnest to\ngo and tell her, but aren’t you afraid of putting her to shame? If even\nshe positively means to leave, you can very well wait until you two have\ngot over this bad blood. And when everything is past and gone, it won’t\nbe any too late for you to explain, in the course of conversation, the\nwhole case to our lady, your mother. But if you now go in hot haste and\ntell her, as if the matter were an urgent one, won’t you be the means of\nmaking our mistress give way to suspicion?”",
        "“My mother,” demurred Pao-yü, “is sure not to entertain any suspicions,\nas all I will explain to her is that she insists upon leaving.”",
        "“When did I ever insist upon going?” sobbed Ch’ing Wen. “You fly into a\nrage, and then you have recourse to threats to intimidate me. But you’re\nat liberty to go and say anything you like; for as I’ll knock my brains\nout against the wall, I won’t get alive out of this door.”",
        "“This is, indeed, strange!” exclaimed Pao-yü. “If you won’t go, what’s\nthe good of all this fuss? I can’t stand this bawling, so it will be a\nriddance if you would get out of the way!”",
        "Saying this, he was resolved upon going to report the matter. Hsi Jen\nfound herself powerless to dissuade him. She had in consequence no other\nresource but to fall on her knees.",
        "Pi Hen, Ch’iu Wen, She Yüeh and the rest of the waiting-maids had\nrealised what a serious aspect the dispute had assumed, and not a sound\nwas to be heard to fall from their lips. They remained standing outside\nlistening to what was going on. When they now overheard Hsi Jen making\nsolicitous entreaties on her knees, they rushed into the apartment in a\nbody; and with one consent they prostrated themselves on the floor.",
        "Pao-yü at once pulled Hsi Jen up. Then with a sigh, he took a seat on\nthe bed. “Get up,” he shouted to the body of girls, “and clear out! What\nwould you have me do?” he asked, addressing himself to Hsi Jen. “This\nheart of mine has been rent to pieces, and no one has any idea about\nit!”",
        "While speaking, tears of a sudden rolled down his cheek. At the sight of\nPao-yü weeping, Hsi Jen also melted into a fit of crying. Ch’ing Wen was\nstanding by them, with watery eyes. She was on the point of reasoning\nwith them, when espying Lin Tai-yü step into the room, she speedily\nwalked out.",
        "“On a grand holiday like this,” remonstrated Lin Tai-yü smiling, “how is\nit that you’re snivelling away, and all for nothing? Is it likely that\nhigh words have resulted all through that ’dumpling’ contest?”",
        "Pao-yü and Lin Tai-yü blurted out laughing.",
        "“You don’t tell me, cousin Secundus,” Lin Tai-yü put in, “but I know all\nabout it, even though I have asked no questions.”",
        "Now she spoke, and now she patted Hsi Jen on the shoulder. “My dear\nsister-in-law,” she smiled, “just you tell me! It must surely be that\nyou two have had a quarrel. Confide in me, your cousin, so that I might\nreconcile you.”",
        "“Miss Lin,” rejoined Hsi Jen, pushing her off, “what are you fussing\nabout? I am simply one of our servant-girls; you’re therefore rather\nerratic in your talk!”",
        "“You say that you’re only a servant-girl,” smilingly replied Tai-yü,\n\"and yet I treat you like a sister-in-law.”",
        "“Why do you,” Pao-yü chimed in, “give her this abusive epithet? But\nhowever much she may make allowance for this, can she, when there are so\nmany others who tell idle tales on her account, put up with your coming\nand telling her all you’ve said?”",
        "“Miss Lin,” smiled Hsi Jen, “you’re not aware of the purpose of my\nheart. Unless my breath fails and I die, I shall continue in his\nservice.”",
        "“If you die,” remarked Lin Tai-yü smiling, “what will others do, I\nwonder? As for me, I shall be the first to die from crying.”",
        "“Were you to die,” added Pao-yü laughingly, “I shall become a bonze.”",
        "“You’d better be a little more sober-minded!” laughed Hsi Jen. “What’s\nthe good of coming out with all these things?”",
        "Lin Tai-yü put out two of her fingers, and puckered up her lips. “Up to\nthis,” she laughed, “he’s become a bonze twice. Henceforward, I’ll try\nand remember how many times you make up your mind to become a Buddhist\npriest!”",
        "This reminded Pao-yü that she was referring to a remark he had made on a\nprevious occasion, but smiling to himself, he allowed the matter to\ndrop.",
        "After a short interval, Lin Tai-yü went away. A servant then came to\nannounce that Mr. Hsüeh wanted to see him, and Pao-yü had to go. The\npurpose of this visit was in fact to invite him to a banquet, and as he\ncould not very well put forward any excuse to refuse, he had to remain\ntill the end of the feast before he was able to take his leave. The\nresult was that, on his return, in the evening, he was to a great extent\nunder the effect of wine. With bustling step, he wended his way into his\nown court. Here he perceived that the cool couch with a back to it, had\nalready been placed in the yard, and that there was some one asleep on\nit. Prompted by the conviction that it must be Hsi Jen, Pao-yü seated\nhimself on the edge of the couch. As he did so, he gave her a push, and\ninquired whether her sore place was any better. But thereupon he saw the\noccupant turn herself round, and exclaim: “What do you come again to\nirritate me for?”",
        "Pao-yü, at a glance, realised that it was not Hsi Jen, but Ch’ing Wen.\nPao-yü then clutched her and compelled her to sit next to him. “Your\ndisposition,” he smiled, “has been more and more spoilt through\nindulgence. When you let the fan drop this morning, I simply made one or\ntwo remarks, and out you came with that long rigmarole. Had you gone for\nme it wouldn’t have mattered; but you also dragged in Hsi Jen, who only\ninterfered with every good intention of inducing us to make it up again.\nBut, ponder now, ought you to have done it; yes or no?”",
        "“With this intense heat,” remonstrated Ch’ing Wen, “why do you pull me\nand toss me about? Should any people see you, what will they think? But\nthis person of mine isn’t meet to be seated in here.”",
        "“Since you yourself know that it isn’t meet,” replied Pao-yü with a\nsmile, “why then were you sleeping here?”",
        "To this taunt Ch’ing Wen had nothing to say. But she spurted out into\nfresh laughter. “It was all right,” she retorted, “during your absence;\nbut the moment you come, it isn’t meet for me to stay! Get up and let me\ngo and have my bath. Hsi Jen and She Yüeh have both had theirs, so I’ll\ncall them here!”",
        "“I’ve just had again a good deal of wine,” remarked Pao-yü, laughingly;\n\"so a wash will be good for me. And since you’ve not had your bath, you\nhad better bring the water and let’s both have it together.”",
        "“No, no!” smiled Ch’ing Wen, waving her hand, “I cannot presume to put\nyou to any trouble, Sir. I still remember how when Pi Hen used to look\nafter your bath you occupied fully two or three hours. What you were up\nto during that time we never knew. We could not very well walk in. When\nyou had however done washing, and we entered your room, we found the\nfloor so covered with water that the legs of the bed were soaking and\nthe matting itself a regular pool. Nor could we make out what kind of\nwashing you’d been having; and for days afterwards we had a laugh over\nit. But I’ve neither any time to get the water ready; nor do I see the\nneed for you to have a wash along with me. Besides, to-day it’s chilly,\nand as you’ve had a bath only a little while back, you can very well\njust now dispense with one. But I’ll draw a basin of water for you to\nwash your face, and to shampoo your head with. Not long ago, Yüan Yang\nsent you a few fruits; they were put in that crystal bowl, so you’d\nbetter tell them to bring them to you to taste.”",
        "“Well, in that case.” laughed Pao-yü, “you needn’t also have a bath.\nJust simply wash your hands, and bring the fruit and let’s have some\ntogether.”",
        "“I’m so shaky,” smiled Ch’ing Wen “that even fans slip out of my hands,\nand how could I fetch the fruit for you. Were I also to break the dish,\nit will be still more dreadful!”",
        "“If you want to break it, break it!” smiled Pao-yü. “These things are\nonly intended for general use. You like this thing; I fancy that; our\nrespective tastes are not identical. The original use of that fan, for\ninstance, was to fan one’s self with; but if you chose to break it for\nfun, you were quite at liberty to do so. The only thing is, when you get\nangry don’t make it the means of giving vent to your temper! Just like\nthose salvers. They are really meant for serving things in. But if you\nfancy that kind of sound, then deliberately smash them, that will be all\nright. But don’t, when you are in high dudgeon avail yourself of them to\nair your resentment! That’s what one would call having a fancy for a\nthing!”",
        "Ch’ing Wen greeted his words with a smile.",
        "“Since that be so,” she said, “bring me your fan and let me tear it.\nWhat most takes my fancy is tearing!”",
        "Upon hearing this Pao-yü smilingly handed it to her. Ch’ing Wen, in\npoint of fact, took it over, and with a crash she rent it in two. Close\nupon this, the sound of crash upon crash became audible.",
        "Pao-yü was standing next to her. “How nice the noise is!” he laughed.\n\"Tear it again and make it sound a little more!”",
        "But while he spoke, She Yüeh was seen to walk in. “Don’t,” she smiled,\n\"be up to so much mischief!” Pao-yü, however, went up to her and\nsnatching her fan also from her hand, he gave it to Ch’ing Wen. Ch’ing\nWen took it and there and then likewise broke it in two. Both he and she\nthen had a hearty laugh.",
        "“What do you call this?” She Yüeh expostulated. “Do you take my property\nand make it the means of distracting yourselves!”",
        "“Open the fan-box,” shouted Pao-yü, “and choose one and take it away!\nWhat, are they such fine things!”",
        "“In that case,” ventured She Yüeh, “fetch the fans and let her break as\nmany as she can. Won’t that be nice!”",
        "“Go and bring them at once!” Pao-yü laughed.",
        "“I won’t be up to any such tomfoolery!” She Yüeh demurred. “She hasn’t\nsnapped her hands, so bid her go herself and fetch them!”",
        "“I’m feeling tired,” interposed Ch’ing Wen, as she laughingly leant on\nthe bed. “I’ll therefore tear some more to-morrow again.”",
        "“An old writer says,” added Pao-yü with a smile, “’that a thousand\nounces of gold cannot purchase a single laugh’! What can a few fans\ncost?”",
        "After moralising, he went on to call Hsi Jen. Hsi Jen had just finished\nthe necessary change in her dress so she stepped in; and a young\nservant-girl, Chiao Hui, crossed over and picked up the broken fans.\nThen they all sat and enjoyed the cool breeze. But we can well dispense\nwith launching into any minute details.",
        "On the morrow, noon found Madame Wang, Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai, Lin Tai-yü, and\nthe rest of the young ladies congregated in dowager lady Chia’s suite of\nrooms. Some one then brought the news that: “Miss Shih had arrived.” In\na little time they perceived Shih Hsiang-yun make her appearance in the\ncourt, at the head of a bevy of waiting-maids and married women.\nPao-ch’ai, Tai-yu and her other cousins, quickly ran down the steps to\nmeet her and exchange greetings. But with what fervour girls of tender\nyears re-unite some day after a separation of months need not, of\ncourse, be explained. Presently, she entered the apartments, paid her\nrespects and inquired how they all were. But after this conventional\ninterchange of salutations, old lady Chia pressed her to take off her\nouter garments as the weather was so close. Shih Hsiang-yün lost no time\nin rising to her feet and loosening her clothes. “I don’t see why,\"\nMadame Wang thereupon smiled, “you wear all these things!’",
        "“It’s entirely at aunt Secunda’s bidding,” retorted Shih Hsiang-yün,\n\"that I put them on. Why, would any one of her own accord wear so many\nthings!”",
        "“Aunt,” interposed Pao-ch’ai, who stood by, with a smile, “you’re not\naware that what most delights her in the matter of dress is to don other\npeople’s clothes! Yes, I remember how, during her stay here in the third\nand fourth moons of last year, she used to wear cousin Pao’s pelisses.\nShe even put on his shoes, and attached his frontlets as well round her\nhead. At a casual glance, she looked the very image of cousin Pao; what\nwas superfluous was that pair of earrings of hers. As she stood at the\nback of that chair she so thoroughly took in our venerable ancestor that\nshe kept on shouting: ’Pao-yü, come over! Mind the tassels suspended on\nthat lamp; for if you shake the dust off, it may get into your eyes!’\nBut all she did was to laugh; she did not budge; and it was only after\nevery one found it hard to keep their countenance that our worthy senior\nalso started laughing. ’You do look well in male habiliments!’ she said\nto her.”",
        "“What about that!” cried Lin Tai-yü, “why, she had scarcely been here\nwith us a couple of days in the first moon of last year, when we sent\nand fetched her, that we had a fall of snow. You, venerable senior, and\nher maternal aunt had on that day, I remember so well, just returned\nfrom worshipping the images of our ancestors, and a brand-new deep red\nfelt wrapper of yours, dear grandmother, had been lying over there, when\nsuddenly it disappeared. But, lo, she it was who had put it on! Being,\nhowever, too large and too long for her, she took a couple of\nhandkerchiefs, and fastened them round her waist. She was then trudging\ninto the back court with the servant-girls to make snow men when she\ntripped and fell flat in front of the drain, and got covered all over\nwith mud.”",
        "As she narrated this incident, every one recalled the circumstances to\nmind, and had a good laugh.",
        "“Dame Chou,” Pao-ch’ai smilingly inquired of nurse Chou, “is your young\nlady always as fond of pranks as ever or not?”",
        "Nurse Chou then also gave a laugh.",
        "“Pranks are nothing,” Ying Ch’un smiled. “What I do detest is her\nfondness for tittle-tattle! I’ve never seen any one who, even when\nasleep, goes on chatter-chatter; now laughing, and now talking, as she\ndoes. Nor can I make out where she gets all those idle yarns of hers.”",
        "“I think she’s better of late,” interposed Madame Wang. “The other day\nsome party or other came and they met; so she’s to have a mother-in-law\nvery soon; and can she still be comporting herself like that!”",
        "“Are you going to stay to-day,” dowager lady Chia then asked, “or going\nback home?”",
        "Nurse Chou smiled. “Your venerable ladyship has not seen what an amount\nof clothes we’ve brought,” she replied. “We mean, of course, to stay a\ncouple of days.”",
        "“Is cousin Pao-yü not at home?” inquired Hsiang-yün.”",
        "“There she’s again! She doesn’t think of others,” remarked Pao-ch’ai\nsmiling significantly. “She only thinks of her cousin Pao-yü. They’re\nboth so fond of larks! This proves that she hasn’t yet got rid of that\nspirit of mischief.”",
        "“You’re all now grown up,” observed old lady Chia; “and you shouldn’t\nallude to infant names.”",
        "But while she was chiding them, they noticed Pao-yü arrive.",
        "“Cousin Yün, have you come?” he smiled. “How is it that you wouldn’t\ncome the other day when some one was despatched to fetch you?”",
        "“It’s only a few minutes,” Madame Wang said, “since our venerable senior\ncalled that one to task, and now here he comes and refers to names and\nsurnames!”",
        "“Your cousin Pao,” ventured Lin Tai-yü, “has something good, which he\nhas been waiting to give you.”",
        "“What good thing is it?” asked Hsiang-yün.",
        "“Do you believe what she says?” observed Pao-yü laughingly. “But how\nmany days is it that I have not seen you, and you’ve grown so much\ntaller!”",
        "“Is cousin Hsi Jen all right?” inquired Hsiang-yün.",
        "“She’s all right,” answered Pao-yü. “Many thanks for your kind thought\nof her.”",
        "“I’ve brought something nice for her,” resumed Hsiang-yün.",
        "Saying this, she produced her handkerchief, tied into a knot.",
        "“What’s this something nice?” asked Pao-yü. “Wouldn’t it have been\nbetter if you’d brought her a couple of those rings with streaked stones\nof the kind you sent the other day?”",
        "“Why, what’s this?” exclaimed Hsiang-yün laughing, opening, as she\nspoke, the handkerchief.",
        "On close scrutiny, they actually found four streaked rings, similar to\nthose she had previously sent, tied up in the same packet.",
        "“Look here!” Lin Tai-yü smiled, “what a girl she is! Had you, when\nsending that fellow the other day to bring ours, given him these also to\nbring along with him, wouldn’t it have saved trouble? Instead of that,\nhere you fussily bring them yourself to-day! I presumed that it was\nsomething out of the way again; but is it really only these things? In\nvery truth, you’re a mere dunce!”",
        "“It’s you who behave like a dunce now!” Shih Hsiang-yün smiled.",
        "“I’ll speak out here and let every one judge for themselves who is the\ndunce. The servant, deputed to bring the things to you, had no need to\nopen his mouth and say anything; for, as soon as they were brought in,\nit was of course evident, at a glance, that they were to be presented to\nyou young ladies. But had he been the bearer of these things for them, I\nwould have been under the necessity of explaining to him which was\nintended for this servant-girl, and which for that. Had the messenger\nhad his wits about him, well and good; but had he been at all stupid he\nwouldn’t have been able to remember so much as the names of the girls!\nHe would have made an awful mess of it, and talked a lot of nonsense. So\ninstead of being of any use he would have even muddled,\nhickledy-pickledy, your things. Had a female servant been despatched, it\nwould have been all right. But as it happened, a servant-boy was again\nsent the other day, so how could he have mentioned the names of the\nwaiting-girls? And by my bringing them in person to give them to them,\ndoesn’t it make things clearer?”",
        "As she said this, she put down the four rings. “One is for sister Hsi\nJen,” she continued, “one is for sister Yüan Yang. One for sister Chin\nCh’uan-erh, and one for sister P’ing Erh. They are only for these four\ngirls; but would the servant-boys too forsooth have remembered them so\nclearly!”",
        "At these words, the whole company smiled. “How really clear!” they\ncried.",
        "“This is what it is to be able to speak!” Pao-yü put in. “She doesn’t\nspare any one!”",
        "Hearing this, Lin Tai-yü gave a sardonic smile. “If she didn’t know how\nto use her tongue,” she observed, “would she deserve to wear that\nunicorn of gold!”",
        "While speaking, she rose and walked off.",
        "Luckily, every one did not hear what she said. Only Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai\npursed up her lips and laughed. Pao-yü, however, had overheard her\nremark, and he blamed himself for having once more talked in a heedless\nmanner. Unawares his eye espied Pao-ch’ai much amused, and he too could\nnot suppress a smile. But at the sight of Pao-yü in laughter, Pao-ch’ai\nhastily rose to her feet and withdrew. She went in search of Tai-yü, to\nhave a chat and laugh with her.",
        "“After you’ve had tea,” old lady Chia thereupon said to Hsiang-yün,\n\"you’d better rest a while and then go and see your sisters-in-law.\nBesides, it’s cool in the garden, so you can walk about with your\ncousins.”",
        "Hsiang-yün expressed her assent, and, collecting the three rings, she\nwrapped them up, and went and lay down to rest. Presently, she got up\nwith the idea of paying visits to lady Feng and her other relatives.\nFollowed by a whole bevy of nurses and waiting-maids, she repaired into\nlady Feng’s quarters on the off side. She bandied words with her for a\nwhile and then coming out she betook herself into the garden of Broad\nVista, and called on Li Kung-ts’ai. But after a short visit, she turned\nher steps towards the I Hung court to look up Hsi Jen. “You people\nneedn’t,” she said, turning her head round, “come along with me! You may\ngo and see your friends and relatives. It will be quite enough if you\nsimply leave Ts’ui Lü to wait upon me.”",
        "Hearing her wishes, each went her own way in quest of aunts, or\nsisters-in-law. There only remained but Hsiang-yün and Ts’ui Lü.",
        "“How is it,” inquired Ts’ui Lü, “that these lotus flowers have not yet\nopened?”",
        "“The proper season hasn’t yet arrived,” rejoined Shih Hsiang-yün.",
        "“They too,” continued Ts’ui Lü, “resemble those in our pond; they are\ndouble flowers.”",
        "“These here,” remarked Hsiang-yün, “are not however up to ours.”",
        "“They have over there,” observed Ts’ui Lü, “a pomegranate tree, with\nfour or five branches joined one to another, just like one storey raised\nabove another storey. What trouble it must have cost them to rear!”",
        "“Flowers and plants,” suggested Shih Hsiang-yün, “are precisely like the\nhuman race. With sufficient vitality, they grow up in a healthy\ncondition.”",
        "“I can’t credit these words,” replied Ts’ui Lü, twisting her face round.\n\"If you maintain that they are like human beings, how is it that I\nhaven’t seen any person, with one head growing over another.”",
        "This rejoinder evoked a smile from Hsiang-yün. “I tell you not to talk,\"\nshe cried, “but you will insist upon talking! How do you expect people\nto be able to answer every thing you say! All things, whether in heaven\nor on earth come into existence by the co-operation of the dual powers,\nthe male and female. So all things, whether good or bad, novel or\nstrange, and all those manifold changes and transformations arise\nentirely from the favourable or adverse influence exercised by the male\nand female powers. And though some things seldom seen by mankind might\ncome to life, the principle at work is, after all, the same.”",
        "“In the face of these arguments,” laughed Ts’ui Lü, “everything, from\nold till now, from the very creation itself, embodies a certain\nproportion of the Yin and Yang principles.”",
        "“You stupid thing!” exclaimed Hsiang-yün smiling, “the more you talk,\nthe more stuff and nonsense falls from your lips! What about everything\nembodying a certain proportion of the principles Yin and Yang! Besides,\nthe two words Yin and Yang are really one word; for when the Yang\nprinciple is exhausted, it becomes the Yin; and when the Yin is\nexhausted, it becomes Yang. And it isn’t that, at the exhaustion of the\nYin, another Yang comes into existence; and that, at the exhaustion of\nthe Yang, a second Yin arises.”",
        "“This trash is sufficient to kill me!” ejaculated Ts’ui Lü. “What are\nthe Yin and Yang? Why, they are without substance or form! But pray,\nMiss, tell me what sort of things these Yin and Yang can be!”",
        "“The Yin and Yang,” explained Hsiang-yün, “are no more than spirits, but\nanything affected by their influence at once assumes form. The heavens,\nfor instance, are Yang, and the earth is Yin; water is Yin and fire is\nYang; the sun is Yang and the moon Yin.”",
        "“Quite so! quite so!” cried out Ts’ui Lü, much amused by these\nexplanations, “I’ve at length attained perception! It isn’t strange then\nthat people invariably call the sun ’T’ai-yang.’ While astrologers keep\non speaking of the moon as ’T’ai-yin-hsing,’ or something like it. It\nmust be on account of this principle.”",
        "“O-mi-to-fu!” laughed Hsiang-yün, “you have at last understood!”",
        "“All these things possess the Yin and Yang; that’s all right.” T’sui Lü\nput in. “But is there any likelihood that all those mosquitoes, flees\nand worms, flowers, herbs, bricks and tiles have, in like manner,\nanything to do with the Yin and Yang?”",
        "“How don’t they!” exclaimed Hsiang-yün. “For example, even the leaves of\nthat tree are distinguished by Yin and Yang. The side, which looks up\nand faces the sun, is called Yang; while that in the shade and looking\ndownwards, is called Yin.”",
        "“Is it really so!” ejaculated T’sui Lü, upon hearing this; while she\nsmiled and nodded her head. “Now I know all about it! But which is Yang\nand which Yin in these fans we’re holding.”",
        "“This side, the front, is Yang,” answered Hsiang-yün; “and that, the\nreverse, is Yin.”",
        "Ts’ui Lü went on to nod her head, and to laugh. She felt inclined to\napply her questions to several other things, but as she could not fix\nher mind upon anything in particular, she, all of a sudden, drooped her\nhead. Catching sight of the pendant in gold, representing a unicorn,\nwhich Hsiang-yün had about her person, she forthwith made allusion to\nit. “This, Miss,” she said smiling, “cannot likely also have any Yin and\nYang!”",
        "“The beasts of the field and the birds of the air,” proceeded\nHsiang-yün, “are, the cock birds, Yang, and the hen birds, Yin. The\nfemales of beasts are Yin; and the males, Yang; so how is there none?”",
        "“Is this male, or is this female?” inquired Ts’ui Lü.",
        "“Ts’ui!” exclaimed Hsiang-yün, “what about male and female! Here you are\nwith your nonsense again.”",
        "“Well, never mind about that,” added Ts’ui Lü, “But how is it that all\nthings have Yin and Yang, and that we human beings have no Yin and no\nYang?”",
        "Hsiang-yün then lowered her face. “You low-bred thing!” she exclaimed.\n\"But it’s better for us to proceed on our way, for the more questions\nyou ask, the nicer they get.”",
        "“What’s there in this that you can’t tell me?” asked Ts’ui Lü, “But I\nknow all about it, so there’s no need for you to keep me on pins and\nneedles.”",
        "Hsiang-yün blurted out laughing. “What do you know?” she said.",
        "“That you, Miss, are Yang, and that I’m Yin,” answered Ts’ui Lü.",
        "Hsiang-yün produced her handkerchief, and, while screening her mouth\nwith it, burst out into a loud fit of laughter.",
        "“What I say must be right for you to laugh in this way,” Ts’ui Lü\nobserved.",
        "“Perfectly right, perfectly right!” acquiesced Hsiang-yün.",
        "“People say,” continued Ts’ui Lü, “that masters are Yang, and that\nservant-girls are Yin; don’t I even apprehend this primary principle?”",
        "“You apprehend it thoroughly,” responded Hsiang-yün laughingly. But\nwhile she was speaking, she espied, under the trellis with the cinnamon\nroses, something glistening like gold. “Do you see that? What is it?\"\nHsiang-yün asked pointing at it.",
        "Hearing this, Ts’ui Lü hastily went over and picked up the object. While\nscrutinising it, she observed with a smile, “Let us find out whether\nit’s Yin or Yang!”",
        "So saying, she first laid hold of the unicorn, belonging to Shih\nHsiang-yün, and passed it under inspection.",
        "Shih Hsiang-yün longed to be shown what she had picked up, but Ts’ui Lü\nwould not open her hand.",
        "“It’s a precious gem,” she smiled. “You mayn’t see it, Miss. Where can\nit be from? How very strange it is! I’ve never seen any one in here with\nanything of the kind.”",
        "“Give it to me and let me look at it,” retorted Hsiang-yün.",
        "Ts’ui Lü stretched out her hand with a dash. “Yes, Miss, please look at\nit!” she laughed.",
        "Hsiang-yün raised her eyes. She perceived, at a glance, that it was a\ngolden unicorn, so beautiful and so bright; and so much larger and\nhandsomer than the one she had on. Hsiang-yün put out her arm and,\ntaking the gem in the palm of her hand, she fell into a silent reverie\nand uttered not a word. She was quite absent-minded when suddenly Pao-yü\nappeared in the opposite direction.",
        "“What are you two,” he asked smiling, “doing here in the sun? How is it\nyou don’t go and find Hsi Jen?”",
        "Shih Hsiang-yün precipitately concealed the unicorn. “We were just\ngoing,” she replied, “so let us all go together.”",
        "Conversing, they, in a company, wended their steps into the I Hung\ncourt. Hsi Jen was leaning on the balustrade at the bottom of the steps,\nher face turned to the breeze. Upon unexpectedly seeing Hsiang-yün\narrive she with alacrity rushed down to greet her; and taking her hand\nin hers, they cheerfully canvassed the events that had transpired during\ntheir separation, while they entered the room and took a seat.",
        "“You should have come earlier,” Pao-yü said. “I’ve got something nice\nand was only waiting for you.”",
        "Saying this, he searched and searched about his person. After a long\ninterval, “Ai-ya!” he ejaculated. “Have you perchance put that thing\naway?” he eagerly asked Hsi Jen.",
        "“What thing?” inquired Hsi Jen.",
        "“The unicorn,” explained Pao-yü, “I got the other day.”",
        "“You’ve daily worn it about you, and how is it you ask me?” remarked Hsi\nJen.",
        "As soon as her answer fell on his ear, Pao-yü clapped his hands. “I’ve\nlost it!” he cried. “Where can I go and look for it!” There and then, he\nmeant to go and search in person; but Shih Hsiang-yün heard his\ninquiries, and concluded that it must be he who had lost the gem. “When\ndid you too,” she promptly smiled, “get a unicorn?”",
        "“I got it the other day, after ever so much trouble;” rejoined Pao-yü,\n\"but I can’t make out when I can have lost it! I’ve also become quite\naddle-headed.”",
        "“Fortunately,” smiled Shih Hsiang-yün, “it’s only a sort of a toy!\nStill, are you so careless?” While speaking, she flung open her hand.\n\"Just see,” she laughed, “is it this or not?”",
        "As soon as he saw it, Pao-yü was seized with unwonted delight. But,\nreader, if you care to know the cause of his delight, peruse the\nexplanation contained in the next chapter.",
        "  Hsi Jen and Hsiang-yün tell their secret thoughts.\n  Tai-yü is infatuated with the living Pao-yü.",
        "While trying to conceal her sense of shame and injury Chin Ch’uan is\ndriven by her impetuous feelings to seek death.",
        "But to resume our narrative. At the sight of the unicorn, Pao-yü was\nfilled with intense delight. So much so, that he forthwith put out his\nhand and made a grab for it. “Lucky enough it was you who picked it up!\"\nhe said, with a face beaming with smiles. “But when did you find it?”",
        "“Fortunately it was only this!” rejoined Shih Hsiang-yün laughing. “If\nyou by and bye also lose your seal, will you likely banish it at once\nfrom your mind, and never make an effort to discover it?”",
        "“After all,” smiled Pao-yü, “the loss of a seal is an ordinary\noccurrence. But had I lost this, I would have deserved to die.”",
        "Hsi Jen then poured a cup of tea and handed it to Shih Hsiang-yün. “Miss\nSenior,” she remarked smilingly, “I heard that you had occasion the\nother day to be highly pleased.”",
        "Shih Hsiang-yün flushed crimson. She went on drinking her tea and did\nnot utter a single word.",
        "“Here you are again full of shame!” Hsi Jen smiled. “But do you remember\nwhen we were living, about ten years back, in those warm rooms on the\nwest side and you confided in me one evening, you didn’t feel any shame\nthen; and how is it you blush like this now?”",
        "“Do you still speak about that!” exclaimed Shih Hsiang-yün laughingly.\n\"You and I were then great friends. But when our mother subsequently\ndied and I went home for a while, how is it you were at once sent to be\nwith my cousin Secundus, and that now that I’ve come back you don’t\ntreat me as you did once?”",
        "“Are you yet harping on this!” retorted Hsi Jen, putting on a smile.\n\"Why, at first, you used to coax me with a lot of endearing terms to\ncomb your hair and to wash your face, to do this and that for you. But\nnow that you’ve become a big girl, you assume the manner of a young\nmistress towards me, and as you put on these airs of a young mistress,\nhow can I ever presume to be on a familiar footing with you?”",
        "“O-mi-to-fu,” cried Shih Hsiang-yün. “What a false accusation! If I be\nguilty of anything of the kind, may I at once die! Just see what a\nbroiling hot day this is, and yet as soon as I arrived I felt bound to\ncome and look you up first. If you don’t believe me, well, ask Lü Erh!\nAnd while at home, when did I not at every instant say something about\nyou?”",
        "Scarcely had she concluded than Hsi Jen and Pao-yü tried to soothe her.\n\"We were only joking,” they said, “but you’ve taken everything again as\ngospel. What! are you still so impetuous in your temperament!”",
        "“You don’t say,” argued Shih Hsiang-yün, “that your words are hard\nthings to swallow, but contrariwise, call people’s temperaments\nimpetuous!”",
        "As she spoke, she unfolded her handkerchief and, producing a ring, she\ngave it to Hsi Jen.",
        "Hsi Jen did not know how to thank her enough. “When;” she consequently\nsmiled, “you sent those to your cousin the other day, I got one also;\nand here you yourself bring me another to-day! It’s clear enough\ntherefore that you haven’t forgotten me. This alone has been quite\nenough to test you. As for the ring itself, what is its worth? but it’s\na token of the sincerity of your heart!”",
        "“Who gave it to you?” inquired Shih Hsiang-yün.",
        "“Miss Pao let me have it.” replied Hsi Jen.",
        "“I was under the impression,” remarked Hsiang-yün with a sigh, “that it\nwas a present from cousin Lin. But is it really cousin Pao, that gave it\nto you! When I was at home, I day after day found myself reflecting that\namong all these cousins of mine, there wasn’t one able to compare with\ncousin Pao, so excellent is she. How I do regret that we are not the\noffspring of one mother! For could I boast of such a sister of the same\nflesh and blood as myself, it wouldn’t matter though I had lost both\nfather and mother!”",
        "While indulging in these regrets, her eyes got quite red.",
        "“Never mind! never mind!” interposed Pao-yü. “Why need you speak of\nthese things!”",
        "“If I do allude to this,” answered Shih Hsiang-yün, “what does it\nmatter? I know that weak point of yours. You’re in fear and trembling\nlest your cousin Lin should come to hear what I say, and get angry with\nme again for eulogising cousin Pao! Now isn’t it this, eh!”",
        "“Ch’ih!” laughed Hsi Jen, who was standing by her. “Miss Yün,” she said,\n\"now that you’ve grown up to be a big girl you’ve become more than ever\nopenhearted and outspoken.”",
        "“When I contend;” smiled Pao-yü, “that it is difficult to say a word to\nany one of you I’m indeed perfectly correct!”",
        "“My dear cousin,” observed Shih Hsiang-yün laughingly, “don’t go on in\nthat strain! You’ll provoke me to displeasure. When you are with me all\nyou are good for is to talk and talk away; but were you to catch a\nglimpse of cousin Lin, you would once more be quite at a loss to know\nwhat best to do!”",
        "“Now, enough of your jokes!” urged Hsi Jen. “I have a favour to crave of\nyou.\"\r",
        "“What is it?” vehemently inquired Shih Hsiang-yün.",
        "“I’ve got a pair of shoes,” answered Hsi Jen, “for which I’ve stuck the\npadding together; but I’m not feeling up to the mark these last few\ndays, so I haven’t been able to work at them. If you have any leisure,\ndo finish them for me.”",
        "“This is indeed strange!” exclaimed Shih Hsiang-yün. “Putting aside all\nthe skilful workers engaged in your household, you have besides some\npeople for doing needlework and others for tailoring and cutting; and\nhow is it you appeal to me to take your shoes in hand? Were you to ask\nany one of those men to execute your work, who could very well refuse to\ndo it?”",
        "“Here you are in another stupid mood!” laughed Hsi Jen. “Can it be that\nyou don’t know that our sewing in these quarters mayn’t be done by these\nneedleworkers.”",
        "At this reply, it at once dawned upon Shih Hsiang-yün that the shoes\nmust be intended for Pao-yü. “Since that be the case,” she in\nconsequence smiled; “I’ll work them for you. There’s however one thing.\nI’ll readily attend to any of yours, but I will have nothing to do with\nany for other people.”",
        "“There you are again!” laughed Hsi Jen. “Who am I to venture to trouble\nyou to make shoes for me? I’ll tell you plainly, however, that they are\nnot mine. But no matter whose they are, it is anyhow I who’ll be the\nrecipient of your favour; that is sufficient.”",
        "“To speak the truth,” rejoined Shih Hsiang-yün, “you’ve put me to the\ntrouble of working, I don’t know how many things for you. The reason why\nI refuse on this occasion should be quite evident to you!”",
        "“I can’t nevertheless make it out!” answered Hsi Jen.",
        "“I heard the other day,” continued Shih Hsiang-yün, a sardonic smile on\nher lip, “that while the fan-case, I had worked, was being held and\ncompared with that of some one else, it too was slashed away in a fit of\nhigh dudgeon. This reached my ears long ago, and do you still try to\ndupe me by asking me again now to make something more for you? Have I\nreally become a slave to you people?",
        "“As to what occurred the other day,” hastily explained Pao-yü smiling,\n\"I positively had no idea that that thing was your handiwork.”",
        "“He never knew that you’d done it,” Hsi Jen also laughed. “I deceived\nhim by telling him that there had been of late some capital hands at\nneedlework outside, who could execute any embroidery with surpassing\nbeauty, and that I had asked them to bring a fan-case so as to try them\nand to see whether they could actually work well or not. He at once\nbelieved what I said. But as he produced the case and gave it to this\none and that one to look at, he somehow or other, I don’t know how,\nmanaged again to put some one’s back up, and she cut it into two. On his\nreturn, however, he bade me hurry the men to make another; and when at\nlength I explained to him that it had been worked by you, he felt, I\ncan’t tell you, what keen regret!”",
        "“This is getting stranger and stranger!” said Shih Hsiang-yün. “It\nwasn’t worth the while for Miss Lin to lose her temper about it. But as\nshe plies the scissors so admirably, why, you might as well tell her to\nfinish the shoes for you.”",
        "“She couldn’t,” replied Hsi Jen, “for besides other things our venerable\nlady is still in fear and trembling lest she should tire herself in any\nway. The doctor likewise says that she will continue to enjoy good\nhealth, so long as she is carefully looked after; so who would wish to\nask her to take them in hand? Last year she managed to just get through\na scented bag, after a whole year’s work. But here we’ve already reached\nthe middle of the present year, and she hasn’t yet taken up any needle\nor thread!”",
        "In the course of their conversation, a servant came and announced ’that\nthe gentleman who lived in the Hsing Lung Street had come.’ “Our\nmaster,” he added, “bids you, Mr. Secundus, come out and greet him.”",
        "As soon as Pao-yü heard this announcement, he knew that Chia Yü-ts’un\nmust have arrived. But he felt very unhappy at heart. Hsi Jen hurried to\ngo and bring his clothes. Pao-yü, meanwhile, put on his boots, but as he\ndid so, he gave way to resentment. “Why there’s father,” he\nsoliloquised, “to sit with him; that should be enough; and must he, on\nevery visit he pays, insist upon seeing me!”",
        "“It is, of course, because you have such a knack for receiving and\nentertaining visitors that Mr. Chia Cheng will have you go out,\"\nlaughingly interposed Shih Hsiang-yün from one side, as she waved her\nfan.",
        "“Is it father’s doing?” Pao-yü rejoined. “Why, it’s he himself who asks\nthat I should be sent for to see him.”",
        "“’When a host is courteous, visitors come often,’” smiled Hsiang-yün,\n\"so it’s surely because you possess certain qualities, which have won\nhis regard, that he insists upon seeing you.”",
        "“But I am not what one would call courteous,” demurred Pao-yü. “I am, of\nall coarse people, the coarsest. Besides, I do not choose to have any\nrelations with such people as himself.”",
        "“Here’s again that unchangeable temperament of yours!” laughed\nHsiang-yün. “But you’re a big fellow now, and you should at least, if\nyou be loth to study and go and pass your examinations for a provincial\ngraduate or a metropolitan graduate, have frequent intercourse with\nofficers and ministers of state and discuss those varied attainments,\nwhich one acquires in an official career, so that you also may be able\nin time to have some idea about matters in general; and that when by and\nbye you’ve made friends, they may not see you spending the whole day\nlong in doing nothing than loafing in our midst, up to every imaginable\nmischief.”",
        "“Miss,” exclaimed Pao-yü, after this harangue, “pray go and sit in some\nother girl’s room, for mind one like myself may contaminate a person who\nknows so much of attainments and experience as you do.”",
        "“Miss,” ventured Hsi Jen, “drop this at once! Last time Miss Pao too\ntendered him this advice, but without troubling himself as to whether\npeople would feel uneasy or not, he simply came out with an ejaculation\nof ’hai,’ and rushed out of the place. Miss Pao hadn’t meanwhile\nconcluded her say, so when she saw him fly, she got so full of shame\nthat, flushing scarlet, she could neither open her lips, nor hold her\nown counsel. But lucky for him it was only Miss Pao. Had it been Miss\nLin, there’s no saying what row there may not have been again, and what\ntears may not have been shed! Yet the very mention of all she had to\ntell him is enough to make people look up to Miss Pao with respect. But\nafter a time, she also betook herself away. I then felt very unhappy as\nI imagined that she was angry; but contrary to all my expectations, she\nwas by and bye just the same as ever. She is, in very truth,\nlong-suffering and indulgent! This other party contrariwise became quite\ndistant to her, little though one would have thought it of him; and as\nMiss Pao perceived that he had lost his temper, and didn’t choose to\nheed her, she subsequently made I don’t know how many apologies to him.”",
        "“Did Miss Lin ever talk such trash!” exclaimed Pao-yü. “Had she ever\ntalked such stuff and nonsense, I would have long ago become chilled\ntowards her.”",
        "“What you say is all trash!” Hsi Jen and Hsiang-yün remarked with one\nvoice, while they shook their heads to and fro and smiled.",
        "Lin Tai-yü, the fact is, was well aware that now that Shih Hsiang-yün\nwas staying in the mansion, Pao-yü too was certain to hasten to come and\ntell her all about the unicorn he had got, so she thought to herself:\n\"In the foreign traditions and wild stories, introduced here of late by\nPao-yü, literary persons and pretty girls are, for the most part,\nbrought together in marriage, through the agency of some trifling but\ningenious nick-nack. These people either have miniature ducks, or\nphoenixes, jade necklets or gold pendants, fine handkerchiefs or elegant\nsashes; and they have, through the instrumentality of such trivial\nobjects, invariably succeeded in accomplishing the wishes they\nentertained throughout their lives.” When she recently discovered, by\nsome unforeseen way, that Pao-yü had likewise a unicorn she began to\napprehend lest he should make this circumstance a pretext to create an\nestrangement with her, and indulge with Shih Hsiang-yün as well in\nvarious free and easy flirtations and fine doings. She therefore quietly\ncrossed over to watch her opportunity and take such action as would\nenable her to get an insight into his and her sentiments. Contrary,\nhowever, to all her calculations, no sooner did she reach her\ndestination, than she overheard Shih Hsiang-yün dilate on the topic of\nexperience, and Pao-yü go on to observe: “Cousin Lin has never indulged\nin such stuff and nonsense. Had she ever uttered any such trash, I would\nhave become chilled even towards her!” This language suddenly produced,\nin Lin Tai-yü’s mind, both surprise as well as delight; sadness as well\nas regret. Delight, at having indeed been so correct in her perception\nthat he whom she had ever considered in the light of a true friend had\nactually turned out to be a true friend. Surprise, “because,” she said\nto herself: “he has, in the presence of so many witnesses, displayed\nsuch partiality as to speak in my praise, and has shown such affection\nand friendliness for me as to make no attempt whatever to shirk\nsuspicion.” Regret, “for since,” (she pondered), “you are my intimate\nfriend, you could certainly well look upon me too as your intimate\nfriend; and if you and I be real friends, why need there be any more\ntalk about gold and jade? But since there be that question of gold and\njade, you and I should have such things in our possession. Yet, why\nshould this Pao-ch’ai step in again between us?” Sad, “because,” (she\nreflected), “my father and mother departed life at an early period; and\nbecause I have, in spite of the secret engraven on my heart and\nimprinted on my bones, not a soul to act as a mentor to me. Besides, of\nlate, I continuously feel confusion creep over my mind, so my disease\nmust already have gradually developed itself. The doctors further state\nthat my breath is weak and my blood poor, and that they dread lest\nconsumption should declare itself, so despite that sincere friendship I\nfoster for you, I cannot, I fear, last for very long. You are, I admit,\na true friend to me, but what can you do for my unfortunate destiny!”",
        "Upon reaching this point in her reflections, she could not control her\ntears, and they rolled freely down her cheeks. So much so, that when\nabout to enter and meet her cousins, she experienced such utter lack of\nzest, that, while drying her tears she turned round, and wended her\nsteps back in the direction of her apartments.",
        "Pao-yü, meanwhile, had hurriedly got into his new costume. Upon coming\nout of doors, he caught sight of Lin Tai-yü, walking quietly ahead of\nhim engaged, to all appearances, in wiping tears from her eyes. With\nrapid stride, he overtook her.",
        "“Cousin Lin,” he smiled, “where are you off to? How is it that you’re\ncrying again? Who has once more hurt your feelings?”",
        "Lin Tai-yü turned her head round to look; and seeing that it was Pao-yü,\nshe at once forced a smile. “Why should I be crying,” she replied, “when\nthere is no reason to do so?”",
        "“Look here!” observed Pao-yü smilingly. “The tears in your eyes are not\ndry yet and do you still tell me a fib?”",
        "Saying this, he could not check an impulse to raise his arm and wipe her\neyes, but Lin Tai-yü speedily withdrew several steps backwards. “Are you\nagain bent,” she said, “upon compassing your own death! Then why do you\nknock your hands and kick your feet about in this wise?”",
        "“While intent upon speaking, I forgot,” smiled Pao-yü, “all about\npropriety and gesticulated, yet quite inadvertently. But what care I\nwhether I die or live!”",
        "“To die would, after all” added Lin Tai-yü, “be for you of no matter;\nbut you’ll leave behind some gold or other, and a unicorn too or other;\nand what would they do?”",
        "This insinuation was enough to plunge Pao-yü into a fresh fit of\nexasperation. Hastening up to her: “Do you still give vent to such\nlanguage?” he asked. “Why, it’s really tantamount to invoking\nimprecations on me! What, are you yet angry with me!”",
        "This question recalled to Lin Tai-yü’s mind the incidents of a few days\nback, and a pang of remorse immediately gnawed her heart for having been\nagain so indiscreet in her speech. “Now don’t you distress your mind!\"\nshe observed hastily, smiling. “I verily said what I shouldn’t! Yet what\nis there in this to make your veins protrude, and to so provoke you as\nto bedew your whole face with perspiration?”",
        "While reasoning with him, she felt unable to repress herself, and,\napproaching him, she extended her hand, and wiped the perspiration from\nhis face.",
        "Pao-yü gazed intently at her for a long time. “Do set your mind at\nease!” he at length observed.",
        "At this remark, Lin Tai-yü felt quite nervous. “What’s there to make my\nmind uneasy?” she asked after a protracted interval. “I can’t make out\nwhat you’re driving at; tell me what’s this about making me easy or\nuneasy?”",
        "Pao-yü heaved a sigh. “Don’t you truly fathom the depth of my words?” he\ninquired. “Why, do you mean to say that I’ve throughout made such poor\nuse of my love for you as not to be able to even divine your feelings?\nWell, if so, it’s no wonder that you daily lose your temper on my\naccount!”",
        "“I actually don’t understand what you mean by easy or uneasy,” Lin\nTai-yü replied.",
        "“My dear girl,” urged Pao-yü, nodding and sighing. “Don’t be making a\nfool of me! For if you can’t make out these words, not only have I ever\nuselessly lavished affection upon you, but the regard, with which you\nhave always treated me, has likewise been entirely of no avail! And it’s\nmostly because you won’t set your mind at ease that your whole frame is\nriddled with disease. Had you taken things easier a bit, this ailment of\nyours too wouldn’t have grown worse from day to day!”",
        "These words made Lin Tai-yü feel as if she had been blasted by thunder,\nor struck by lightning. But after carefully weighing them within\nherself, they seemed to her far more fervent than any that might have\nemanated from the depths of her own heart, and thousands of sentiments,\nin fact, thronged together in her mind; but though she had every wish to\nframe them into language, she found it a hard task to pronounce so much\nas half a word. All she therefore did was to gaze at him with vacant\nstare.",
        "Pao-yü fostered innumerable thoughts within himself, but unable in a\nmoment to resolve from which particular one to begin, he too absently\nlooked at Tai-yü. Thus it was that the two cousins remained for a long\ntime under the spell of a deep reverie.",
        "An ejaculation of “Hai!” was the only sound that issued from Lin\nTai-yü’s lips; and while tears streamed suddenly from her eyes, she\nturned herself round and started on her way homeward.",
        "Pao-yü jumped forward, with alacrity, and dragged her back. “My dear\ncousin,” he pleaded, “do stop a bit! Let me tell you just one thing;\nafter that, you may go.”",
        "“What can you have to tell me?” exclaimed Lin Tai-yü, who while wiping\nher tears, extricated her hand from his grasp. “I know.” she cried, “all\nyou have to say.”",
        "As she spoke, she went away, without even turning her head to cast a\nglance behind her.",
        "As Pao-yü gazed at her receding figure, he fell into abstraction.",
        "He had, in fact, quitted his apartments a few moments back in such\nprecipitate hurry that he had omitted to take a fan with him: and Hsi\nJen, fearing lest he might suffer from the heat, promptly seized one and\nran to find him and give it to him. But upon casually raising her head,\nshe espied Lin Tai-yü standing with him. After a time, Tai-yü walked\naway; and as he still remained where he was without budging, she\napproached him.",
        "“You left,” she said, “without even taking a fan with you. Happily I\nnoticed it, and so hurried to catch you up and bring it to you.”",
        "But Pao-yü was so lost in thought that as soon as he caught Hsi Jen’s\nvoice, he made a dash and clasped her in his embrace, without so much as\ntrying to make sure who she was.",
        "“My dear cousin,” he cried, “I couldn’t hitherto muster enough courage\nto disclose the secrets of my heart; but on this occasion I shall make\nbold and give utterance to them. For you I’m quite ready to even pay the\npenalty of death. I have too for your sake brought ailments upon my\nwhole frame. It’s in here! But I haven’t ventured to breathe it to any\none. My only alternative has been to bear it patiently, in the hope that\nwhen you got all right, I might then perchance also recover. But whether\nI sleep, or whether I dream, I never, never forget you.”",
        "These declarations quite dumfoundered Hsi Jen. She gave way to incessant\napprehensions. All she could do was to shout out: “Oh spirits, oh\nheaven, oh Buddha, he’s compassing my death!” Then pushing him away from\nher, “what is it you’re saying?” she asked. “May it be that you are\npossessed by some evil spirit! Don’t you quick get yourself off?”",
        "This brought Pao-yü to his senses at once. He then became aware that it\nwas Hsi Jen, and that she had come to bring him a fan. Pao-yü was\noverpowered with shame; his whole face was suffused with scarlet; and,\nsnatching the fan out of her hands, he bolted away with rapid stride.",
        "When Hsi Jen meanwhile saw Pao-yü effect his escape, “Lin Tai-yü,” she\npondered, “must surely be at the bottom of all he said just now. But\nfrom what one can see, it will be difficult, in the future, to obviate\nthe occurrence of some unpleasant mishap. It’s sufficient to fill one\nwith fear and trembling!”",
        "At this point in her cogitations, she involuntarily melted into tears,\nso agitated was she; while she secretly exercised her mind how best to\nact so as to prevent this dreadful calamity.",
        "But while she was lost in this maze of surmises and doubts, Pao-ch’ai\nunexpectedly appeared from the off side. “What!” she smilingly\nexclaimed, “are you dreaming away in a hot broiling sun like this?”",
        "Hsi Jen, at this question, hastily returned her smiles. “Those two\nbirds,” she answered, “were having a fight, and such fun was it that I\nstopped to watch them.”",
        "“Where is cousin Pao off to now in such a hurry, got up in that fine\nattire?” asked Pao-ch’ai, “I just caught sight of him, as he went by. I\nmeant to have called out and stopped him, but as he, of late, talks\ngreater rubbish than ever, I didn’t challenge him, but let him go past.”",
        "“Our master,” rejoined Hsi Jen, “sent for him to go out.”",
        "“Ai-yah!” hastily exclaimed Pao-ch’ai, as soon as this remark reached\nher ears. “What does he want him for, on a scalding day like this? Might\nhe not have thought of something and got so angry about it as to send\nfor him to give him a lecture!”",
        "“If it isn’t this,” added Hsi Jen laughing, “some visitor must, I\npresume, have come and he wishes him to meet him.”",
        "“With weather like this,” smiled Pao-ch’ai, “even visitors afford no\namusement! Why don’t they, while this fiery temperature lasts, stay at\nhome, where it’s much cooler, instead of gadding about all over the\nplace?”",
        "“Could you tell them so?” smiled Hsi Jen.",
        "“What was that girl Hsiang-yün doing in your quarters?” Pao-ch’ai then\nasked.",
        "“She only came to chat with us on irrelevant matters.” Hsi Jen replied\nsmiling. “But did you see the pair of shoes I was pasting the other day?\nWell, I meant to ask her to-morrow to finish them for me.”",
        "Pao-chai, at these words, turned her head round, first on this side, and\nthen on the other. Seeing that there was no one coming or going: “How is\nit,” she smiled, “that you, who have so much gumption, don’t ever show\nany respect for people’s feelings? I’ve been of late keeping an eye on\nMiss Yün’s manner, and, from what I can glean from the various rumours\nafloat, she can’t be, in the slightest degree, her own mistress at home!\nIn that family of theirs, so little can they stand the burden of any\nheavy expenses that they don’t employ any needlework-people, and\nordinary everyday things are mostly attended to by their ladies\nthemselves. (If not), why is it that every time she has come to us on a\nvisit, and she and I have had a chat, she at once broached the subject\nof their being in great difficulties at home, the moment she perceived\nthat there was no one present? Yet, whenever I went on to ask her a few\nquestions about their usual way of living, her very eyes grew red, while\nshe made some indistinct reply; but as for speaking out, she wouldn’t.\nBut when I consider the circumstances in which she is placed, for she\nhas certainly had the misfortune of being left, from her very infancy,\nwithout father and mother, the very sight of her is too much for me, and\nmy heart begins to bleed within me.”",
        "“Quite so! Quite so!” observed Hsi Jen, clapping her hands, after\nlistening to her throughout. “It isn’t strange then if she let me have\nthe ten butterfly knots I asked her to tie for me only after ever so\nmany days, and if she said that they were coarsely done, but that I\nshould make the best of them and use them elsewhere, and that if I\nwanted any nice ones, I should wait until by and bye when she came to\nstay here, when she would work some neatly for me. What you’ve told me\nnow reminds me that, as she had found it difficult to find an excuse\nwhen we appealed to her, she must have had to slave away, who knows how\nmuch, till the third watch in the middle of the night. What a stupid\nthing I was! Had I known this sooner, I would never have told her a word\nabout it.”",
        "“Last time;” continued Pao-ch’ai, “she told me that when she was at home\nshe had ample to do, that she kept busy as late as the third watch, and\nthat, if she did the slightest stitch of work for any other people, the\nvarious ladies, belonging to her family, did not like it.”",
        "“But as it happens,” explained Hsi Jen, “that mulish-minded and\nperverse-tempered young master of ours won’t allow the least bit of\nneedlework, no matter whether small or large, to be made by those\npersons employed to do sewing in the household. And as for me, I have no\ntime to turn my attention to all these things.”",
        "“Why mind him?” laughed Pao-ch’ai. “Simply ask some one to do the work\nand finish.”",
        "“How could one bamboozle him?” resumed Hsi Jen. “Why, he’ll promptly\nfind out everything. Such a thing can’t even be suggested. The only\nthing I can do is to quietly slave away, that’s all.”",
        "“You shouldn’t work so hard,” smiled Pao-ch’ai. “What do you say to my\ndoing a few things for you?”",
        "“Are you in real earnest!” ventured Hsi Jen smiling. “Well, in that\ncase, it is indeed a piece of good fortune for me! I’ll come over myself\nin the evening.”",
        "But before she could conclude her reply, she of a sudden noticed an old\nmatron come up to her with precipitate step. “Where does the report come\nfrom,” she interposed, “that Miss Chin Ch’uan-erh has gone, for no rhyme\nor reason, and committed suicide by jumping into the well?”",
        "This bit of news startled Hsi Jen. “Which Chin Ch’uan-erh is it,” she\nspeedily inquired.",
        "“Where are two Chin Ch’uan-erhs to be found!” rejoined the old matron.\n\"It’s the one in our Mistress,’ Madame Wang’s, apartments, who was the\nother day sent away for something or other, I don’t know what. On her\nreturn home, she raised her groans to the skies and shed profuse tears,\nbut none of them worried their minds about her, until, who’d have\nthought it, they could see nothing of her. A servant, however, went just\nnow to draw water and he says that ’while he was getting it from the\nwell in the south-east corner, he caught sight of a dead body, that he\nhurriedly called men to his help, and that when they fished it out, they\nunexpectedly found that it was she, but that though they bustled about\ntrying to bring her round, everything proved of no avail’”",
        "“This is odd!” Pao-ch’ai exclaimed.",
        "The moment Hsi Jen heard the tidings, she shook her head and moaned. At\nthe remembrance of the friendship, which had ever existed between them,\ntears suddenly trickled down her cheeks. And as for Pao-ch’ai, she\nlistened to the account of the accident and then hastened to Madame\nWang’s quarters to try and afford her consolation.",
        "Hsi Jen, during this interval, returned to her room. But we will leave\nher without further notice, and explain that when Pao-ch’ai reached the\ninterior of Madame Wang’s home, she found everything plunged in perfect\nstillness. Madame Wang was seated all alone in the inner chamber\nindulging her sorrow. But such difficulties did Pao-ch’ai experience to\nallude to the occurrence, that her only alternative was to take a seat\nnext to her.",
        "“Where do you come from?” asked Madame Wang.",
        "“I come from inside the garden,” answered Pao-ch’ai.",
        "“As you come from the garden,” Madame Wang inquired, “did you see\nanything of your cousin Pao-yü?”",
        "“I saw him just now,” Pao-ch’ai replied, “go out, dressed up in his\nfineries. But where he is gone to, I don’t know.”",
        "“Have you perchance heard of any strange occurrence?” asked Madame Wang,\nwhile she nodded her head and sighed. “Why, Chin Ch’uan Erh jumped into\nthe well and committed suicide.”",
        "“How is it that she jumped into the well when there was nothing to make\nher do so?” Pao-ch’ai inquired. “This is indeed a remarkable thing!”",
        "“The fact is,” proceeded Madame Wang, “that she spoilt something the\nother day, and in a sudden fit of temper, I gave her a slap and sent her\naway, simply meaning to be angry with her for a few days and then bring\nher in again. But, who could have ever imagined that she had such a\nresentful temperament as to go and drown herself in a well! And is not\nthis all my fault?”",
        "“It’s because you are such a kind-hearted person, aunt,” smiled\nPao-ch’ai, “that such ideas cross your mind! But she didn’t jump into\nthe well when she was in a tantrum; so what must have made her do so was\nthat she had to go and live in the lower quarters. Or, she might have\nbeen standing in front of the well, and her foot slipped, and she fell\ninto it. While in the upper rooms, she used to be kept under restraint,\nso when this time she found herself outside, she must, of course, have\nfelt the wish to go strolling all over the place in search of fun. How\ncould she have ever had such a fiery disposition? But even admitting\nthat she had such a temper, she was, after all, a stupid girl to do as\nshe did; and she doesn’t deserve any pity.”",
        "“In spite of what you say,” sighed Madame Wang, shaking her head to and\nfro, “I really feel unhappy at heart.”",
        "“You shouldn’t, aunt, distress your mind about it!” Pao-ch’ai smiled.\n\"Yet, if you feel very much exercised, just give her a few more taels\nthan you would otherwise have done, and let her be buried. You’ll thus\ncarry out to the full the feelings of a mistress towards her servant.”",
        "“I just now gave them fifty taels for her,” pursued Madame Wang. “I also\nmeant to let them have some of your cousin’s new clothes to enshroud her\nin. But, who’d have thought it, none of the girls had, strange\ncoincidence, any newly-made articles of clothing; and there were only\nthat couple of birthday suits of your cousin Lin’s. But as your cousin\nLin has ever been such a sensitive child and has always too suffered and\nailed, I thought it would be unpropitious for her, if her clothes were\nalso now handed to people to wrap their dead in, after she had been told\nthat they were given her for her birthday. So I ordered a tailor to get\na suit for her as soon as possible. Had it been any other servant-girl,\nI could have given her a few taels and have finished. But Chin\nCh’uan-erh was, albeit a servant-maid, nearly as dear to me as if she\nhad been a daughter of mine.”",
        "Saying this, tears unwittingly ran down from her eyes.",
        "“Aunt!” vehemently exclaimed Pao-ch’ai. “What earthly use is it of\nhurrying a tailor just now to prepare clothes for her? I have a couple\nof suits I made the other day and won’t it save trouble were I to go and\nbring them for her? Besides, when she was alive, she used to wear my old\nclothes. And what’s more our figures are much alike.”",
        "“What you say is all very well,” rejoined Madame Wang; “but can it be\nthat it isn’t distasteful to you?”",
        "“Compose your mind,” urged Pao-ch’ai with a smile. “I have never paid\nany heed to such things.”",
        "As she spoke, she rose to her feet and walked away.",
        "Madame Wang then promptly called two servants. “Go and accompany Miss\nPao!” she said.",
        "In a brief space of time, Pao-ch’ai came back with the clothes, and\ndiscovered Pao-yü seated next to Madame Wang, all melted in tears.\nMadame Wang was reasoning with him. At the sight of Pao-ch’ai, she, at\nonce, desisted. When Pao-ch’ai saw them go on in this way, and came to\nweigh their conversation and to scan the expression on their\ncountenances, she immediately got a pretty correct insight into their\nfeelings. But presently she handed over the clothes, and Madame Wang\nsent for Chin Ch’uan-erh’s mother, to take them away.",
        "But, reader, you will have to peruse the next chapter for further\ndetails.",
        "  A brother is prompted by ill-feeling to wag his tongue a bit.\n  A depraved son receives heavy blows with a rattan cane.",
        "Madame Wang, for we shall now continue our story, sent for Chin\nCh’uan-erh’s mother. On her arrival, she gave her several hair-pins and\nrings, and then told her that she could invite several Buddhist priests\nas well to read the prayers necessary to release the spirit from\npurgatory. The mother prostrated herself and expressed her gratitude;\nafter which, she took her leave.",
        "Indeed, Pao-yü, on his return from entertaining Yü-ts’un, heard the\ntidings that Chin Ch’uan-erh had been instigated by a sense of shame to\ntake her own life and he at once fell a prey to grief. So much so, that,\nwhen he came inside, and was again spoken to and admonished by Madame\nWang, he could not utter a single word in his justification. But as soon\nas he perceived Pao-ch’ai make her appearance in the room, he seized the\nopportunity to scamper out in precipitate haste. Whither he was\ntrudging, he himself had not the least idea. But throwing his hands\nbehind his back and drooping his head against his chest, he gave way to\nsighs, while with slow and listless step he turned towards the hall.\nScarcely, however, had he rounded the screen-wall, which stood in front\nof the door-way, when, by a strange coincidence, he ran straight into\nthe arms of some one, who was unawares approaching from the opposite\ndirection, and was just about to go towards the inner portion of the\ncompound.",
        "“Hallo!” that person was heard to cry out, as he stood still.",
        "Pao-yü sustained a dreadful start. Raising his face to see, he\ndiscovered that it was no other than his father. At once, he\nunconsciously drew a long breath and adopted the only safe course of\ndropping his arms against his body and standing on one side.",
        "“Why are you,” exclaimed Chia Cheng, “drooping your head in such a\nmelancholy mood, and indulging in all these moans? When Yü-ts’un came\njust now and he asked to see you, you only put in your appearance after\na long while. But though you did come, you were not in the least\ndisposed to chat with anything like cheerfulness and animation; you\nbehaved, as you ever do, like a regular fool. I detected then in your\ncountenance a certain expression of some hidden hankering and sadness;\nand now again here you are groaning and sighing! Does all you have not\nsuffice to please you? Are you still dissatisfied? You’ve no reason to\nbe like this, so why is it that you go on in this way?”",
        "Pao-yü had ever, it is true, shown a glib tongue, but on the present\noccasion he was so deeply affected by Chin Ch’uan-erh’s fate, and vexed\nat not being able to die that very instant and follow in her footsteps\nthat although he was now fully conscious that his father was speaking to\nhim he could not, in fact, lend him an ear, but simply stood in a timid\nand nervous mood. Chia Cheng noticed that he was in a state of trembling\nand fear, not as ready with an answer as he usually was, and his sorry\nplight somewhat incensed him, much though he had not at first borne him\nany ill-feeling. But just as he was about to chide him, a messenger\napproached and announced to him: “Some one has come from the mansion of\nthe imperial Prince Chung Shun, and wishes to see you, Sir.” At this\nannouncement, surmises sprung up in Chia Cheng’s mind. “Hitherto,” he\nsecretly mused, “I’ve never had any dealings with the Chung Shun\nmansion, and why is it that some one is despatched here to-day?” As he\ngave way to these reflections. “Be quick,” he shouted, “and ask him to\ntake a seat in the pavilion,” while he himself precipitately entered the\ninner room and changed his costume. When he came out to greet the\nvisitor, he discovered that it was the senior officer of the Chung Shun\nmansion. After the exchange of the salutations prescribed by the rites,\nthey sat down and tea was presented. But before (Chia Cheng) had had\ntime to start a topic of conversation, the senior officer anticipated\nhim, and speedily observed: “Your humble servant does not pay this visit\nto-day to your worthy mansion on his own authority, but entirely in\ncompliance with instructions received, as there is a favour that I have\nto beg of you. I make bold to trouble you, esteemed Sir, on behalf of\nhis highness, to take any steps you might deem suitable, and if you do,\nnot only will his highness remember your kindness, but even I, your\nhumble servant, and my colleagues will feel extremely grateful to you.”",
        "Chia Cheng listened to him, but he could not nevertheless get a clue of\nwhat he was driving at. Promptly returning his smile, he rose to his\nfeet. “You come, Sir,” he inquired, “at the instance of his royal\nhighness, but what, I wonder, are the commands you have to give me? I\nhope you will explain them to your humble servant, worthy Sir, in order\nto enable him to carry them out effectively.”",
        "The senior officer gave a sardonic smile.",
        "“There’s nothing to carry out,” he said. “All you, venerable Sir, have\nto do is to utter one single word and the whole thing will be effected.\nThere is in our mansion a certain Ch’i Kuan, who plays the part of young\nladies. He hitherto stayed quietly in the mansion; but for the last\nthree or five days or so no one has seen him return home. Search has\nbeen instituted in every locality, yet his whereabouts cannot be\ndiscovered. But throughout these various inquiries, eight out of the ten\ntenths of the inhabitants of the city have, with one consent, asserted\nthat he has of late been on very friendly terms with that honourable son\nof yours, who was born with the jade in his mouth. This report was told\nyour servant and his colleagues, but as your worthy mansion is unlike\nsuch residences as we can take upon ourselves to enter and search with\nimpunity, we felt under the necessity of laying the matter before our\nimperial master. ’Had it been any of the other actors,’ his highness\nalso says, ’I wouldn’t have minded if even one hundred of them had\ndisappeared; but this Ch’i Kuan has always been so ready with pat\nrepartee, so respectful and trustworthy that he has thoroughly won my\naged heart, and I could never do without him.’ He entreats you,\ntherefore, worthy Sir, to, in your turn, plead with your illustrious\nscion, and request him to let Ch’i Kuan go back, in order that the\nfeelings, which prompt the Prince to make such earnest supplications,\nmay, in the first place, be satisfied: and that, in the next, your mean\nservant and his associates may be spared the fatigue of toiling and\nsearching.”",
        "At the conclusion of this appeal, he promptly made a low bow. As soon as\nChia Cheng found out the object of his errand, he felt both astonishment\nand displeasure. With all promptitude, he issued directions that Pao-yü\nshould be told to come out of the garden. Pao-yü had no notion whatever\nwhy he was wanted. So speedily he hurried to appear before his father.",
        "“What a regular scoundrel you are!” Chia Cheng exclaimed. “It is enough\nthat you won’t read your books at home; but will you also go in for all\nthese lawless and wrongful acts? That Ch’i Kuan is a person whose\npresent honourable duties are to act as an attendant on his highness the\nPrince of Chung Shun, and how extremely heedless of propriety must you\nbe to have enticed him, without good cause, to come away, and thus have\nnow brought calamity upon me?”",
        "These reproaches plunged Pao-yü in a dreadful state of consternation.\nWith alacrity he said by way of reply: “I really don’t know anything\nabout the matter! To what do, after all, the two words Ch’i Kuan refer,\nI wonder! Still less, besides, am I aware what entice can imply!”",
        "As he spoke, he started crying.",
        "But before Chia Cheng could open his month to pass any further remarks,\n\"Young gentleman,” he heard the senior officer interpose with a sardonic\nsmile: “you shouldn’t conceal anything! if he be either hidden in your\nhome, or if you know his whereabouts, divulge the truth at once; so that\nless trouble should fall to our lot than otherwise would. And will we\nnot then bear in mind your virtue, worthy scion!”",
        "“I positively don’t know.” Pao-yü time after time maintained. “There\nmust, I fear, be some false rumour abroad; for I haven’t so much as seen\nanything of him.”",
        "The senior officer gave two loud smiles, full of derision. “There’s\nevidence at hand,” he rejoined, “so if you compel me to speak out before\nyour venerable father, won’t you, young man, have to suffer the\nconsequences? But as you assert that you don’t know who this person is,\nhow is it that that red sash has come to be attached to your waist?”",
        "When Pao-yü caught this allusion, he suddenly felt quite out of his\nsenses. He stared and gaped; while within himself, he argued: “How has\nhe come to hear anything about this! But since he knows all these secret\nparticulars, I cannot, I expect, put him off in other points; so\nwouldn’t it be better for me to pack him off, in order to obviate his\nblubbering anything more?” “Sir,” he consequently remarked aloud, “how\nis it that despite your acquaintance with all these minute details, you\nhave no inkling of his having purchased a house? Are you ignorant of an\nessential point like this? I’ve heard people say that he’s, at present,\nstaying in the eastern suburbs at a distance of twenty li from the city\nwalls; at some place or other called Tzu T’an Pao, and that he has\nbought there several acres of land and a few houses. So I presume he’s\nto be found in that locality; but of course there’s no saying.”",
        "“According to your version,” smiled the senior officer, as soon as he\nheard his explanation, “he must for a certainty be there. I shall\ntherefore go and look for him. If he’s there, well and good; but if not,\nI shall come again and request you to give me further directions.”",
        "These words were still on his lips, when he took his leave and walked\noff with hurried step.",
        "Chia Cheng was by this time stirred up to such a pitch of indignation\nthat his eyes stared aghast, and his mouth opened in bewilderment; and\nas he escorted the officer out, he turned his head and bade Pao-yü not\nbudge. “I have,” (he said), “to ask you something on my return.\"\nStraightway he then went to see the officer off. But just as he was\nturning back, he casually came across Chia Huan and several servant-boys\nrunning wildly about in a body. “Quick, bring him here to me!” shouted\nChia Cheng to the young boys. “I want to beat him.”",
        "Chia Huan, at the sight of his father, was so terrified that his bones\nmollified and his tendons grew weak, and, promptly lowering his head, he\nstood still.”",
        "“What are you running about for?” Chia Cheng asked. “These menials of\nyours do not mind you, but go who knows where, and let you roam about\nlike a wild horse! Where are the attendants who wait on you at school?\"\nhe cried.",
        "When Chia Huan saw his father in such a dreadful rage, he availed\nhimself of the first opportunity to try and clear himself. “I wasn’t\nrunning about just now” he said. “But as I was passing by the side of\nthat well, I caught sight, for in that well a servant-girl was drowned,\nof a human head that large, a body that swollen, floating about in\nreally a frightful way and I therefore hastily rushed past.”",
        "Chia Cheng was thunderstruck by this disclosure. “There’s been nothing\nup, so who has gone and jumped into the well?” he inquired. “Never has\nthere been anything of the kind in my house before! Ever since the time\nof our ancestors, servants have invariably been treated with clemency\nand consideration. But I expect that I must of late have become remiss\nin my domestic affairs, and that the managers must have arrogated to\nthemselves the right of domineering and so been the cause of bringing\nabout such calamities as violent deaths and disregard of life. Were\nthese things to reach the ears of people outside, what will become of\nthe reputation of our seniors? Call Chia Lien and Lai Ta here!” he\nshouted.",
        "The servant-lads signified their obedience, with one voice. They were\nabout to go and summon them, when Chia Huan hastened to press forward.\nGrasping the lapel of Chia Cheng’s coat, and clinging to his knees, he\nknelt down. “Father, why need you be angry?” he said. “Excluding the\npeople in Madame Wang’s rooms, this occurrence is entirely unknown to\nany of the rest; and I have heard my mother mention....” At this point,\nhe turned his head, and cast a glance in all four quarters.",
        "Chia Cheng guessed his meaning, and made a sign with his eyes. The young\nboys grasped his purpose and drew far back on either side.",
        "Chia Huan resumed his confidences in a low tone of voice. “My mother,\"\nhe resumed, “told me that when brother Pao-yü was, the other day, in\nMadame Wang’s apartments, he seized her servant-maid Chin Ch’uan-erh\nwith the intent of dishonouring her. That as he failed to carry out his\ndesign, he gave her a thrashing, which so exasperated Chin Ch’uan-erh\nthat she threw herself into the well and committed suicide....”",
        "Before however he could conclude his account, Chia Cheng had been\nincensed to such a degree that his face assumed the colour of silver\npaper. “Bring Pao-yü here,” he cried. While uttering these orders, he\nwalked into the study. “If any one does again to-day come to dissuade\nme,” he vociferated, “I shall take this official hat, and sash, my home\nand private property and surrender everything at once to him to go and\nbestow them upon Pao-yü; for if I cannot escape blame (with a son like\nthe one I have), I mean to shave this scanty trouble-laden hair about my\ntemples and go in search of some unsullied place where I can spend the\nrest of my days alone! I shall thus also avoid the crime of heaping,\nabove, insult upon my predecessors, and, below, of having given birth to\nsuch a rebellious son.”",
        "At the sight of Chia Cheng in this exasperation, the family companions\nand attendants speedily realised that Pao-yü must once more be the cause\nof it, and the whole posse hastened to withdraw from the study, biting\ntheir fingers and putting their tongues out.",
        "Chia Cheng panted with excitement. He stretched his chest out and sat\nbolt upright on a chair. His whole face was covered with the traces of\ntears. “Bring Pao-yü! Bring Pao-yü!” he shouted consecutively. “Fetch a\nbig stick; bring a rope and tie him up; close all the doors! If any one\ndoes communicate anything about it in the inner rooms, why, I’ll\nimmediately beat him to death.”",
        "The servant-boys felt compelled to express their obedience with one\nconsent, and some of them came to look after Pao-yü.",
        "As for Pao-yü, when he heard Chia Cheng enjoin him not to move, he\nforthwith became aware that the chances of an unpropitious issue\noutnumbered those of a propitious one, but how could he have had any\nidea that Chia Huan as well had put in his word? There he still stood in\nthe pavilion, revolving in his mind how he could get some one to speed\ninside and deliver a message for him. But, as it happened, not a soul\nappeared. He was quite at a loss to know where even Pei Ming could be.\nHis longing was at its height, when he perceived an old nurse come on\nthe scene. The sight of her exulted Pao-yü, just as much as if he had\nobtained pearls or gems; and hurriedly approaching her, he dragged her\nand forced her to halt. “Go in,” he urged, “at once and tell them that\nmy father wishes to beat me to death. Be quick, be quick, for it’s\nurgent, there’s no time to be lost.”",
        "But, first and foremost, Pao-yü’s excitement was so intense that he\nspoke with indistinctness. In the second place, the old nurse was, as\nluck would have it, dull of hearing, so that she did not catch the drift\nof what he said, and she misconstrued the two words: “it’s urgent,” for\nthe two representing jumped into the well. Readily smiling therefore:\n\"If she wants to jump into the well, let her do so,” she said. “What’s\nthere to make you fear, Master Secundus?”",
        "“Go out,” pursued Pao-yü, in despair, on discovering that she was deaf,\n\"and tell my page to come.”",
        "“What’s there left unsettled?” rejoined the old nurse. “Everything has\nbeen finished long ago! A tip has also been given them; so how is it\nthings are not settled?”",
        "Pao-yü fidgetted with his hands and feet. He was just at his wits’ ends,\nwhen he espied Chia Cheng’s servant-boys come up and press him to go\nout.",
        "As soon as Chia Cheng caught sight of him, his eyes got quite red.\nWithout even allowing himself any time to question him about his gadding\nabout with actors, and the presents he gave them on the sly, during his\nabsence from home; or about his playing the truant from school and\nlewdly importuning his mother’s maid, during his stay at home, he simply\nshouted: “Gag his mouth and positively beat him till he dies!”",
        "The servant-boys did not have the boldness to disobey him. They were\nunder the necessity of seizing Pao-yü, of stretching him on a bench, and\nof taking a heavy rattan and giving him about ten blows.",
        "Pao-yü knew well enough that he could not plead for mercy, and all he\ncould do was to whimper and cry.",
        "Chia Cheng however found fault with the light blows they administered to\nhim. With one kick he shoved the castigator aside, and snatching the\nrattan into his own hands, he spitefully let (Pao-yü) have ten blows and\nmore.",
        "Pao-yü had not, from his very birth, experienced such anguish. From the\r\noutset, he found the pain unbearable; yet he could shout and weep as\r\nboisterously as ever he pleased; but so weak subsequently did his\nbreath, little by little, become, so hoarse his voice, and so choked his\nthroat that he could not bring out any sound.",
        "The family companions noticed that he was beaten in a way that might\nlead to an unpropitious end, and they drew near with all despatch and\nmade earnest entreaties and exhortations. But would Chia Cheng listen to\nthem?",
        "“You people,” he answered, “had better ask him whether the tricks he has\nbeen up to deserve to be overlooked or not! It’s you who have all along\nso thoroughly spoilt him as to make him reach this degree of depravity!\nAnd do you yet come to advise me to spare him? When by and bye you’ve\nincited him to commit parricide or regicide, you will at length, then,\ngive up trying to dissuade me, eh?”",
        "This language jarred on the ears of the whole party; and knowing only\ntoo well that he was in an exasperated mood, they fussed about\nendeavouring to find some one to go in and convey the news.",
        "But Madame Wang did not presume to be the first to inform dowager lady\nChia about it. Seeing no other course open to her, she hastily dressed\nherself and issued out of the garden. Without so much as worrying her\nmind as to whether there were any male inmates about or not, she\nstraightway leant on a waiting-maid and hurriedly betook herself into\nthe library, to the intense consternation of the companions, pages and\nall the men present, who could not manage to clear out of the way in\ntime.",
        "Chia Cheng was on the point of further belabouring his son, when at the\nsight of Madame Wang walking in, his temper flared up with such\nincreased violence, just as fire on which oil is poured, that the rod\nfell with greater spite and celerity. The two servant-boys, who held\nPao-yü down, precipitately loosened their grip and beat a retreat.\nPao-yü had long ago lost all power of movement. Chia Cheng, however, was\nagain preparing to assail him, when the rattan was immediately locked\ntightly by Madame Wang, in both her arms.",
        "“Of course, of course,” Chia Cheng exclaimed, “what you want to do\nto-day is to make me succumb to anger!”",
        "“Pao-yü does, I admit, merit to be beaten,” sobbed Madame Wang; “but you\nshould also, my lord, take good care of yourself! The weather, besides,\nis extremely hot, and our old lady is not feeling quite up to the mark.\nWere you to knock Pao-yü about and kill him, it would not matter much;\nbut were perchance our venerable senior to suddenly fall ill, wouldn’t\nit be a grave thing?”",
        "“Better not talk about such things!” observed Chia Cheng with a listless\nsmile. “By my bringing up such a degenerate child of retribution I have\nmyself become unfilial! Whenever I’ve had to call him to account, there\nhas always been a whole crowd of you to screen him; so isn’t it as well\nfor me to avail myself of to-day to put an end to his cur-like existence\nand thus prevent future misfortune?”",
        "As he spoke, he asked for a rope to strangle him; but Madame Wang lost\nno time in clasping him in her embrace, and reasoning with him as she\nwept. “My lord and master,” she said, “it is your duty, of course, to\nkeep your son in proper order, but you should also regard the\nrelationship of husband and wife. I’m already a woman of fifty and I’ve\nonly got this scapegrace. Was there any need for you to give him such a\nbitter lesson? I wouldn’t presume to use any strong dissuasion; but\nhaving, on this occasion, gone so far as to harbour the design of\nkilling him, isn’t this a fixed purpose on your part to cut short my own\nexistence? But as you are bent upon strangling him, be quick and first\nstrangle me before you strangle him! It will be as well that we, mother\nand son, should die together, so that if even we go to hell, we may be\nable to rely upon each other!”",
        "At the conclusion of these words, she enfolded Pao-yü in her embrace and\nraised her voice in loud sobs.",
        "After listening to her appeal, Chia Cheng could not restrain a deep\nsigh; and taking a seat on one of the chairs, the tears ran down his\r\ncheeks like drops of rain.",
        "But while Madame Wang held Pao-yü in her arms, she noticed that his face\nwas sallow and his breath faint, and that his green gauze nether\ngarments were all speckled with stains of blood, so she could not check\nher fingers from unloosening his girdle. And realising that from the\nthighs to the buttocks, his person was here green, there purple, here\nwhole, there broken, and that there was, in fact, not the least bit,\nwhich had not sustained some injury, she of a sudden burst out in bitter\nlamentations for her offspring’s wretched lot in life. But while\nbemoaning her unfortunate son, she again recalled to mind the memory of\nChia Chu, and vehemently calling out “Chia Chu,” she sobbed: “if but you\nwere alive, I would not care if even one hundred died!”",
        "But by this time, the inmates of the inner rooms discovered that Madame\nWang had gone out, and Li Kung-ts’ai, Wang Hsi-feng and Ting Ch’un and\nher sisters promptly rushed out of the garden and came to join her.",
        "While Madame Wang mentioned, with eyes bathed in tears, the name of Chia\nChu, every one listened with composure, with the exception of Li\nKung-ts’ai, who unable to curb her feelings also raised her voice in\nsobs. As soon as Chia Cheng heard her plaints, his tears trickled down\nwith greater profusion, like pearls scattered about. But just as there\nseemed no prospect of their being consoled, a servant-girl was unawares\nheard to announce: “Our dowager lady has come!” Before this announcement\nwas ended, her tremulous accents reached their ears from outside the\nwindow. “If you were to beat me to death and then despatch him,” she\ncried, “won’t you be clear of us!”",
        "Chia Cheng, upon seeing that his mother was coming, felt distressed and\r\npained. With all promptitude, he went out to meet her. He perceived his\nold parent, toddling along, leaning on the arm of a servant-girl,\nwagging her head and gasping for breath.",
        "Chia Cheng drew forward and made a curtsey. “On a hot broiling day like\nthis,” he ventured, forcing a smile, “what made you, mother, get so\nangry as to rush over in person? Had you anything to enjoin me, you\ncould have sent for me, your son, and given me your orders.”",
        "Old lady Chia, at these words, halted and panted. “Are you really\nchiding me?” she at the same time said in a stern tone. “It’s I who\nshould call you to task! But as the son, I’ve brought up, isn’t worth a\nstraw, to whom can I go and address a word?”",
        "When Chia Cheng heard language so unlike that generally used by her, he\nimmediately fell on his knees. While doing all in his power to contain\nhis tears: “The reason why,” he explained, “your son corrects his\noffspring is a desire to reflect lustre on his ancestors and splendour\non his seniors; so how can I, your son, deserve the rebuke with which\nyou greet me, mother?”",
        "At this reply, old lady Chia spurted contemptuously. “I made just one\nremark,” she added, “and you couldn’t stand it, and can Pao-yü likely\nput up with that death-working cane? You say that your object in\ncorrecting your son is to reflect lustre on your ancestors and splendour\non your seniors, but in what manner did your father correct you in days\ngone by?”",
        "Saying this, tears suddenly rolled down from her eyes also.",
        "Chia Cheng forced another smile. “Mother;” he proceeded, “you shouldn’t\ndistress yourself! Your son did it in a sudden fit of rage, but from\nthis time forth I won’t touch him again.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia smiled several loud sneering smiles. “But you\nshouldn’t get into a huff with me!” she urged. “He’s your son, so if you\nchoose to flog him, you can naturally do so, but I cannot help thinking\nthat you’re sick and tired of me, your mother, of your wife and of your\nson, so wouldn’t it be as well that we should get out of your way, the\nsooner the better, as we shall then be able to enjoy peace and quiet?”",
        "So speaking, “Go and look after the chairs.” she speedily cried to a\nservant. “I and your lady as well as Pao-yü will, without delay, return\nto Nanking.”",
        "The servant had no help but to assent.",
        "Old lady Chia thereupon called Madame Wang over to her. “You needn’t\nindulge in sorrow!” she exhorted her. “Pao-yü is now young, and you\ncherish him fondly; but does it follow that when in years to come he\nbecomes an official, he’ll remember that you are his mother? You mustn’t\ntherefore at present lavish too much of your affection upon him, so that\nyou may by and bye, spare yourself, at least, some displeasure.”",
        "When these exhortations fell on Chia Cheng’s ear, he instantly\nprostrated himself before her. “Your remarks mother,” he observed, “cut\nthe ground under your son’s very feet.”",
        "“You distinctly act in a way,” cynically smiled old lady Chia,\n\"sufficient to deprive me of any ground to stand upon, and then you, on\nthe contrary, go and speak about yourself! But when we shall have gone\nback, your mind will be free of all trouble. We’ll see then who’ll\ninterfere and dissuade you from beating people!”",
        "After this reply, she went on to give orders to directly get ready the\nbaggage, carriages, chairs and horses necessary for their return.",
        "Chia Cheng stiffly and rigidly fell on his knees, and knocked his head\nbefore her, and pleaded guilty. Dowager lady Chia then addressed him\nsome words, and as she did so, she came to have a look at Pao-yü. Upon\nperceiving that the thrashing he had got this time was unlike those of\npast occasions, she experienced both pain and resentment. So clasping\nhim in her arms, she wept and wept incessantly. It was only after Madame\nWang, lady Feng and the other ladies had reasoned with her for a time\nthat they at length gradually succeeded in consoling her.",
        "But waiting-maids, married women, and other attendants soon came to\nsupport Pao-yü and take him away. Lady Feng however at once expostulated\nwith them. “You stupid things,” she exclaimed, won’t you open your eyes\nand see! How ever could he be raised and made to walk in the state he’s\nin! Don’t you yet instantly run inside and fetch some rattan slings and\na bench to carry him out of this on?",
        "At this suggestion, the servants rushed hurry-scurry inside and actually\nbrought a bench; and, lifting Pao-yü, they placed him on it. Then\nfollowing dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang and the other inmates into the\ninner part of the building, they carried him into his grandmother’s\napartments. But Chia Cheng did not fail to notice that his old mother’s\npassion had not by this time yet abated, so without presuming to consult\nhis own convenience, he too came inside after them. Here he discovered\nhow heavily he had in reality castigated Pao-yü. Upon perceiving Madame\nWang also crying, with one breath, “My flesh;” and, with another, saying\nwith tears: “My son, if you had died sooner, instead of Chu Erh, and\nleft Chu Erh behind you, you would have saved your father these fits of\nanger, and even I would not have had to fruitlessly worry and fret for\nhalf of my existence! Were anything to happen now to make you forsake\nme, upon whom will you have me depend?” And then after heaping\nreproaches upon herself for a time, break out afresh in lamentations for\nher, unavailing offspring, Chia Cheng was much cut up and felt conscious\nthat he should not with his own hand have struck his son so ruthlessly\nas to bring him to this state, and he first and foremost directed his\nattention to consoling dowager lady Chia.",
        "“If your son isn’t good,” rejoined the old lady, repressing her tears,\n\"it is naturally for you to exercise control over him. But you shouldn’t\nbeat him to such a pitch! Don’t you yet bundle yourself away? What are\nyou dallying in here for? Is it likely, pray, that your heart is not yet\nsatisfied, and that you wish to feast your eyes by seeing him die before\nyou go?”",
        "These taunts induced Chia Cheng to eventually withdraw out of the room.\nBy this time, Mrs. Hsüeh together with Pao-ch’ai, Hsiang Ling, Hsi Jen,\nShih Hsiang-yün and his other cousins had also congregated in the\napartments. Hsi Jen’s heart was overflowing with grief; but she could\nnot very well give expression to it. When she saw that a whole company\nof people shut him in, some pouring water over him, others fanning him;\nand that she herself could not lend a hand in any way, she availed\nherself of a favourable moment to make her exit. Proceeding then as far\nas the second gate, she bade the servant-boys go and fetch Pei-Ming. On\nhis arrival, she submitted him to a searching inquiry. “Why is it,” she\nasked, “that he was beaten just now without the least provocation; and\nthat you didn’t run over soon to tell me a word about it?”",
        "“It happened,” answered Pei Ming in great perplexity, “that I wasn’t\npresent. It was only after he had given him half the flogging that I\nheard what was going on, and lost no time in ascertaining what it was\nall about. It’s on account of those affairs connected with Ch’i Kuan and\nthat girl Chin Ch’uan.”",
        "“How did these things come to master’s knowledge?” inquired Hsi Jen.",
        "“As for that affair with Ch’i Kuan,” continued Pei Ming, “it is very\nlikely Mr. Hsüeh P’an who has let it out; for as he has ever been\njealous, he may, in the absence of any other way of quenching his\nresentment, have instigated some one or other outside, who knows, to\ncome and see master and add fuel to his anger. As for Chin Ch’uan-erh’s\naffair it has presumably been told him by Master Tertius. This I heard\nfrom the lips of some person, who was in attendance upon master.”",
        "Hsi Jen saw how much his two versions tallied with the true\ncircumstances, so she readily credited the greater portion of what was\ntold her. Subsequently, she returned inside. Here she found a whole\ncrowd of people trying to do the best to benefit Pao-yü. But after they\nhad completed every arrangement, dowager lady Chia impressed on their\nminds that it would be better were they to carefully move him into his\nown quarters. With one voice they all signified their approval, and with\na good deal of bustling and fussing, they speedily transferred Pao-yü\ninto the I Hung court, where they stretched him out comfortably on his\nown bed. Then after some further excitement, the members of the family\nbegan gradually to disperse. Hsi Jen at last entered his room, and\nwaited upon him with singleness of heart.",
        "But, reader, if you feel any curiosity to hear what follows, listen to\nwhat you will find divulged in the next chapter.",
        "  Tai-yü loves Pao-yü with extreme affection; but, on account of this\n      affection, her female cousin gets indignant.\n  Hsüeh P’an commits a grave mistake; but Pao-ch’ai makes this mistake a\n      pretext to tender advice to her brother.",
        "When Hsi Jen saw dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang and the other members of\nthe family take their leave, our narrative says, she entered the room.\nand, taking a seat next to Pao-yü, she asked him, while she did all she\ncould to hide her tears: “How was it that he beat you to such extremes?”",
        "Pao-yü heaved a sigh. “It was simply,” he replied, “about those trifles.\nBut what’s the use of your asking me about them? The lower part of my\nbody is so very sore! Do look and see where I’m bruised!”",
        "At these words, Hsi Jen put out her hand, and inserting it gently under\nhis clothes, she began to pull down the middle garments. She had but\nslightly moved them, however, when Pao-yü ground his teeth and groaned\n\"ai-ya.” Hsi Jen at once stayed her hand. It was after three or four\nsimilar attempts that she, at length, succeeded in drawing them down.\nThen looking closely, Hsi Jen discovered that the upper part of his legs\nwas all green and purple, one mass of scars four fingers wide, and\ncovered with huge blisters.",
        "Hsi Jen gnashed her teeth. “My mother!” she ejaculated, “how is it that\nhe struck you with such a ruthless hand! Had you minded the least bit of\nmy advice to you, things wouldn’t have come to such a pass! Luckily, no\nharm was done to any tendon or bone; for had you been crippled by the\nthrashing you got, what could we do?”",
        "In the middle of these remarks, she saw the servant-girls come, and they\ntold her that Miss Pao-ch’ai had arrived. Hearing this, Hsi Jen saw well\nenough that she had no time to put him on his middle garments, so\nforthwith snatching a double gauze coverlet, she threw it over Pao-yü.\nThis done, she perceived Pao-ch’ai walk in, her hands laden with pills\nand medicines.",
        "“At night,” she said to Hsi Jen, “take these medicines and dissolve them\nin wine and then apply them on him, and, when the fiery virus from that\nstagnant blood has been dispelled, he’ll be all right again.”",
        "After these directions, she handed the medicines to Hsi Jen. “Is he\nfeeling any better now?” she proceeded to inquired.",
        "“Thanks!” rejoined Pao-yü. “I’m feeling better,” he at the same time\nwent on to say; after which, he pressed her to take a seat.",
        "Pao-ch’ai noticed that he could open his eyes wide, that he could speak\nand that he was not as bad as he had been, and she felt considerable\ninward relief. But nodding her head, she sighed. “If you had long ago\nlistened to the least bit of the advice tendered to you by people things\nwould not have reached this climax to-day,” she said. “Not to speak of\nthe pain experienced by our dear ancestor and aunt Wang, the sight of\nyou in this state makes even us feel at heart....”",
        "Just as she had uttered half of the remark she meant to pass, she\nquickly suppressed the rest; and smitten by remorse for having spoken\ntoo hastily, she could not help getting red in the face and lowering her\nhead.",
        "Pao-yü was realising how affectionate, how friendly and how replete with\ndeep meaning were the sentiments that dropped from her month, when, of a\nsudden, he saw her seal her lips and, flashing crimson, droop her head,\nand simply fumble with her girdle. Yet so fascinating was she in those\ntimid blushes, which completely baffle description, that his feelings\nwere roused within him to such a degree, that all sense of pain flew at\nonce beyond the empyrean. “I’ve only had to bear a few blows,” he\nreflected, “and yet every one of them puts on those pitiful looks\nsufficient to evoke love and regard; so were, after all, any mishap or\nuntimely end to unexpectedly befall me, who can tell how much more\nafflicted they won’t be! And as they go on in this way, I shall have\nthem, were I even to die in a moment, to feel so much for me; so there\nwill indeed be no reason for regret, albeit the concerns of a whole\nlifetime will be thus flung entirely to the winds!”",
        "While indulging in these meditations, ha overheard Pao-ch’ai ask Hsi\nJen: “How is it that he got angry, without rhyme or reason, and started\nbeating him?” and Hsi Jen tell her, in reply, the version given to her\nby Pei Ming.",
        "Pao-yü had, in fact, no idea as yet of what had been said by Chia Huan,\nand, when he heard Hsi Jen’s disclosures, he eventually got to know what\nit was; but as it also criminated Hsüeh P’an, he feared lest Pao-ch’ai\nmight feel unhappy, so he lost no time in interrupting Hsi Jen.",
        "“Cousin Hsüeh,” he interposed, “has never been like that; you people\nmustn’t therefore give way to idle surmises!”",
        "These words were enough to make Pao-ch’ai see that Pao-yü had thought it\nexpedient to say something to stop Hsi Jen’s mouth, apprehending that\nher suspicions might get roused; and she consequently secretly mused\nwithin herself: “He has been beaten to such a pitch, and yet, heedless\nof his own pains and aches, he’s still so careful not to hurt people’s\nfeelings. But since you can be so considerate, why don’t you take a\nlittle more care in greater concerns outside, so that your father should\nfeel a little happier, and that you also should not have to suffer such\nbitter ordeals! But notwithstanding that the dread of my feeling hurt\nhas prompted you to interrupt Hsi Jen in what she had to tell me, is it\nlikely that I am blind to the fact that my brother has ever followed his\nfancies, allowed his passions to run riot, and never done a thing to\nexercise any check over himself? His temperament is such that he some\ntime back created, all on account of that fellow Ch’in Chung, a rumpus\nthat turned heaven and earth topsy-turvy; and, as a matter of course,\nhe’s now far worse than he was ever before!”",
        "“You people,” she then observed aloud, at the close of these\ncogitations, “shouldn’t bear this one or that one a grudge. I can’t help\nthinking that it’s, after all, because of your usual readiness, cousin\nPao-yü, to hobnob with that set that your father recently lost control\nover his temper. But assuming that my brother did speak in a careless\nmanner and did casually allude to you cousin Pao-yü, it was with no\ndesign to instigate any one! In the first place, the remarks he made\nwere really founded on actual facts; and secondly, he’s not one to ever\ntrouble himself about such petty trifles as trying to guard against\nanimosities. Ever since your youth up, Miss Hsi, you’ve simply had\nbefore your eyes a person so punctilious as cousin Pao-yü, but have you\never had any experience of one like that brother of mine, who neither\nfears the powers in heaven or in earth, and who readily blurts out all\nhe thinks?”",
        "Hsi Jen, seeing Pao-yü interrupt her, at the bare mention of Hsüeh P’an,\nunderstood at once that she must have spoken recklessly and gave way to\nmisgivings lest Pao-ch’ai might not have been placed in a false\nposition, but when she heard the language used by Pao-ch’ai, she was\nfilled with a keener sense of shame and could not utter a word. Pao-yü\ntoo, after listening to the sentiments, which Pao-ch’ai expressed, felt,\npartly because they were so magnanimous and noble, and partly because\nthey banished all misconception from his mind, his heart and soul throb\nwith greater emotion then ever before. When, however, about to put in\nhis word, he noticed Pao-ch’ai rise to her feet.",
        "“I’ll come again to see you to-morrow,” she said, “but take good care of\nyourself! I gave the medicines I brought just now to Hsi Jen; let her\nrub you with them at night and I feel sure you’ll get all right.”",
        "With these recommendations, she walked out of the door.",
        "Hsi Jen hastened to catch her up and escorted her beyond the court.\n\"Miss,” she remarked, “we’ve really put you to the trouble of coming.\nSome other day, when Mr. Secundus is well, I shall come in person to\nthank you.”",
        "“What’s there to thank me for?” replied Pao-ch’ai, turning her head\nround and smiling. “But mind, you advise him to carefully tend his\nhealth, and not to give way to idle thoughts and reckless ideas, and\nhe’ll recover. If there’s anything he fancies to eat or to amuse himself\nwith, come quietly over to me and fetch it for him. There will be no use\nto disturb either our old lady, or Madame Wang, or any of the others;\nfor in the event of its reaching Mr. Chia Cheng’s ear, nothing may, at\nthe time, come of it; but if by and bye he finds it to be true, we’ll,\ndoubtless, suffer for it!”",
        "While tendering this advice, she went on her way.",
        "Hsi Jen retraced her steps and returned into the room, fostering genuine\nfeelings of gratitude for Pao-ch’ai. But on entering, she espied Pao-yü\nsilently lost in deep thought, and looking as if he were asleep, and yet\nnot quite asleep, so she withdrew into the outer quarters to comb her\nhair and wash.",
        "Pao-yü meanwhile lay motionless in bed. His buttocks tingled with pain,\nas if they were pricked with needles, or dug with knives; giving him to\nboot a fiery sensation just as if fire were eating into them. He tried\nto change his position a bit, but unable to bear the anguish, he burst\ninto groans. The shades of evening were by this time falling. Perceiving\nthat though Hsi Jen had left his side there remained still two or three\nwaiting-maids in attendance, he said to them, as he could find nothing\nfor them to do just then, “You might as well go and comb your hair and\nperform your ablutions; come in, when I call you.”",
        "Hearing this, they likewise retired. During this while, Pao-yü fell into\na drowsy state. Chiang Yü-han then rose before his vision and told him\nall about his capture by men from the Chung Shun mansion. Presently,\nChin Ch’uan-erh too appeared in his room bathed in tears, and explained\nto him the circumstances which drove her to leap into the well. But\nPao-yü, who was half dreaming and half awake, was not able to give his\nmind to anything that was told him. Unawares, he became conscious of\nsome one having given him a push; and faintly fell on his ear the\nplaintive tones of some person in distress. Pao-yü was startled out of\nhis dreams. On opening his eyes, he found it to be no other than Lin\nTai-yü. But still fearing that it was only a dream, he promptly raised\nhimself, and drawing near her face he passed her features under a minute\nscrutiny. Seeing her two eyes so swollen, as to look as big as peaches,\nand her face glistening all over with tears: “If it is not Tai-yü,” (he\nthought), “who else can it be?”",
        "Pao-yü meant to continue his scrutiny, but the lower part of his person\ngave him such unbearable sharp twitches that finding it a hard task to\nkeep up, he, with a shout of “Ai-yo,” lay himself down again, as he\nheaved a sigh. “What do you once more come here for?” he asked. “The\nsun, it is true, has set; but the heat remaining on the ground hasn’t\nyet gone, so you may, by coming over, get another sunstroke. Of course,\nI’ve had a thrashing but I don’t feel any pains or aches. If I behave in\nthis fashion, it’s all put on to work upon their credulity, so that they\nmay go and spread the reports outside in such a way as to reach my\r\nfather’s ear. Really it’s all sham; so you mustn’t treat it as a fact!”",
        "Though Lin Tai-yü was not giving way at the time to any wails or loud\nsobs, yet the more she indulged in those suppressed plaints of hers, the\nworse she felt her breath get choked and her throat obstructed; so that\nwhen Pao-yü’s assurances fell on her ear, she could not express a single\nsentiment, though she treasured thousands in her mind. It was only after\na long pause that she at last could observe, with agitated voice: “You\nmust after this turn over a new leaf.”",
        "At these words, Pao-yü heaved a deep sigh. “Compose your mind,” he\nurged. “Don’t speak to me like this; for I am quite prepared to even lay\ndown my life for all those persons!”",
        "But scarcely had he concluded this remark than some one outside the\ncourt was heard to say: “Our lady Secunda has arrived.”",
        "Lin Tai-yü readily concluded that it was lady Feng coming, so springing\nto her feet at once, “I’m off,” she said; “out by the back-court. I’ll\nlook you up again by and bye.”",
        "“This is indeed strange!” exclaimed Pao-yü as he laid hold of her and\ntried to detain her. “How is it that you’ve deliberately started living\nin fear and trembling of her!”",
        "Lin Tai-yü grew impatient and stamped her feet. “Look at my eyes!” she\nadded in an undertone. “Must those people amuse themselves again by\npoking fun at me?”",
        "After this response, Pao-yü speedily let her go.",
        "Lin Tai-yü with hurried step withdrew behind the bed; and no sooner had\nshe issued into the back-court, than lady Feng made her appearance in\nthe room by the front entrance.",
        "“Are you better?” she asked Pao-yü. “If you fancy anything to eat, mind\nyou send some one over to my place to fetch it for you.”",
        "Thereupon Mrs. Hsüeh also came to pay him a visit. Shortly after, a\nmessenger likewise arrived from old lady Chia (to inquire after him).",
        "When the time came to prepare the lights, Pao-yü had a couple of\nmouthfuls of soup to eat, but he felt so drowsy and heavy that he fell\nasleep.",
        "Presently, Chou Jui’s wife, Wu Hsin-teng’s wife and Cheng Hao-shih’s\nwife, all of whom were old dames who frequently went to and fro, heard\nthat Pao-yü had been flogged and they too hurried into his quarters.",
        "Hsi Jen promptly went out to greet them. “Aunts,” she whispered,\nsmiling, “you’ve come a little too late; Master Secundus is sleeping.\"\nSaying this, she led them into the room on the opposite side, and,\npressing then to sit down, she poured them some tea.",
        "After sitting perfectly still for a time, “When Master Secundus awakes\"\nthe dames observed, “do send us word!”",
        "Hsi Jen assured them that she would, and escorted them out. Just,\nhowever, as she was about to retrace her footsteps, she met an old\nmatron, sent over by Madame Wang, who said to her: “Our mistress wants\none of Master Secundus attendants to go and see her.”",
        "Upon hearing this message, Hsi Jen communed with her own thoughts. Then\nturning round, she whispered to Ch’ing Wen, She Yüeh, Ch’iu Wen, and the\nother maids: “Our lady wishes to see one of us, so be careful and remain\nin the room while I go. I’ll be back soon.”",
        "At the close of her injunctions, she and the matron made their exit out\nof the garden by a short cut, and repaired into the drawing-room.",
        "Madame Wang was seated on the cool couch, waving a banana-leaf fan. When\nshe became conscious of her arrival: “It didn’t matter whom you sent,\"\nshe remarked, “any one would have done. But have you left him again?\nWho’s there to wait on him?”",
        "At this question, Hsi Jen lost no time in forcing a smile. “Master\nSecundus,” she replied, “just now fell into a sound sleep. Those four or\nfive girls are all right now, they are well able to attend to their\nmaster, so please, Madame, dispel all anxious thoughts! I was afraid\nthat your ladyship might have some orders to give, and that if I sent\nany of them, they might probably not hear distinctly, and thus occasion\ndelay in what there was to be done.”",
        "“There’s nothing much to tell you,” added Madame Wang. “I only wish to\nask how his pains and aches are getting on now?”",
        "“I applied on Mr. Secundus,” answered Hsi Jen, “the medicine, which Miss\nPao-ch’ai brought over; and he’s better than he was. He was so sore at\none time that he couldn’t lie comfortably; but the deep sleep, in which\nhe is plunged now, is a clear sign of his having improved.”",
        "“Has he had anything to eat?” further inquired Madame Wang.",
        "“Our dowager mistress sent him a bowl of soup,” Hsi Jen continued, “and\nof this he has had a few mouthfuls. He shouted and shouted that his\nmouth was parched and fancied a decoction of sour plums, but remembering\nthat sour plums are astringent things, that he had been thrashed only a\nshort time before, and that not having been allowed to groan, he must,\nof course, have been so hard pressed that fiery virus and heated blood\nmust unavoidably have accumulated in the heart, and that were he to put\nanything of the kind within his lips, it might be driven into the\ncardiac regions and give rise to some serious illness; and what then\nwould we do? I therefore reasoned with him for ever so long and at last\nsucceeded in deterring him from touching any. So simply taking that\nsyrup of roses, prepared with sugar, I mixed some with water and he had\nhalf a small cup of it. But he drank it with distaste; for, being\nsurfeited with it, he found it neither scented nor sweet.”",
        "“Ai-yah!” ejaculated Madame Wang. “Why didn’t you come earlier and tell\nme? Some one sent me the other day several bottles of scented water. I\nmeant at one time to have given him some, but as I feared that it would\nbe mere waste, I didn’t let him have any. But since he is so sick and\ntired of that preparation of roses, that he turns up his nose at it,\ntake those two bottles with you. If you just mix a teaspoonful of it in\na cup of water, it will impart to it a very strong perfume.”",
        "So saying, she hastened to tell Ts’ai Yün to fetch the bottles of\nscented water, which she had received as a present a few days before.",
        "“Let her only bring a couple of them, they’ll be enough!” Hsi Jen chimed\nin. “If you give us more, it will be a useless waste! If it isn’t\nenough, I can come and fetch a fresh supply. It will come to the same\nthing!”",
        "Having listened to all they had to say, Ts’ai Yün left the room. After\nsome considerable time, she, in point of fact, returned with only a\ncouple of bottles, which she delivered to Hsi Jen.",
        "On examination, Hsi Jen saw two small glass bottles, no more than three\ninches in size, with screwing silver stoppers at the top. On the\ngosling-yellow labels was written, on one: “Pure extract of olea\nfragrans,” on the other, “Pure extract of roses.”",
        "“What fine things these are!” Hsi Jen smiled. “How many small bottles\nthe like of this can there be?”",
        "“They are of the kind sent to the palace,” rejoined Madame Wang. “Didn’t\nyou notice that gosling-yellow slip? But mind, take good care of them\nfor him; don’t fritter them away!”",
        "Hsi Jen assented. She was about to depart when Madame Wang called her\nback. “I’ve thought of something,” she said, “that I want to ask you.”",
        "Hsi Jen hastily came back.",
        "Madame Wang made sure that there was no one in the room. “I’ve heard a\nfaint rumour,” she then inquired, “to the effect that Pao-yü got a\nthrashing on this occasion on account of something or other which\nHuan-Erh told my husband. Have you perchance heard what it was that he\nsaid? If you happen to learn anything about it, do confide in me, and I\nwon’t make any fuss and let people know that it was you who told me.”",
        "“I haven’t heard anything of the kind,” answered Hsi Jen. “It was\nbecause Mr. Secundus forcibly detained an actor, and that people came\nand asked master to restore him to them that he got flogged.”",
        "“It was also for this,” continued Madame Wang as she nodded her head,\n\"but there’s another reason besides.”",
        "“As for the other reason, I honestly haven’t the least idea about it,\"\nexplained Hsi Jen. “But I’ll make bold to-day, and say something in your\npresence, Madame, about which I don’t know whether I am right or wrong\nin speaking. According to what’s proper....”",
        "She had only spoken half a sentence, when hastily she closed her mouth\nagain.",
        "“You are at liberty to proceed,” urged Madame Wang.",
        "“If your ladyship will not get angry, I’ll speak out,” remarked Hsi Jen.",
        "“Why should I get angry?” observed Madame Wang. “Proceed!”",
        "“According to what’s proper,” resumed Hsi Jen, “our Mr. Secundus should\nreceive our master’s admonition, for if master doesn’t hold him in\ncheck, there’s no saying what he mightn’t do in the future.”",
        "As soon as Madame Wang heard this, she clasped her hands and uttered the\ninvocation, “O-mi-to-fu!” Unable to resist the impulse, she drew near\nHsi Jen. “My dear child,” she added, “you have also luckily understood\nthe real state of things. What you told me is in perfect harmony with my\nown views! Is it likely that I don’t know how to look after a son? In\nformer days, when your elder master, Chu, was alive, how did I succeed\nin keeping him in order? And can it be that I don’t, after all, now\nunderstand how to manage a son? But there’s a why and a wherefore in it.\nThe thought is ever present in my mind now, that I’m already a woman\npast fifty, that of my children there only remains this single one, that\nhe too is developing a delicate physique, and that, what’s more, our\ndear senior prizes him as much as she would a jewel, that were he kept\nunder strict control, and anything perchance to happen to him, she\nmight, an old lady as she is, sustain some harm from resentment, and\nthat as the high as well as the low will then have no peace or quiet,\nwon’t things get in a bad way? So I feel prompted to spoil him by\nover-indulgence. Time and again I reason with him. Sometimes, I talk to\nhim; sometimes, I advise him; sometimes, I cry with him. But though, for\nthe time being, he’s all right, he doesn’t, later on, worry his mind in\nany way about what I say, until he positively gets into some other mess,\nwhen he settles down again. But should any harm befall him, through\nthese floggings, upon whom will I depend by and bye?”",
        "As she spoke, she could not help melting into tears.",
        "At the sight of Madame Wang in this disconsolate mood, Hsi Jen herself\nunconsciously grew wounded at heart, and as she wept along with her,\n\"Mr. Secundus,” she ventured, “is your ladyship’s own child, so how\ncould you not love him? Even we, who are mere servants, think it a piece\nof good fortune when we can wait on him for a time, and all parties can\nenjoy peace and quiet. But if he begins to behave in this manner, even\npeace and quiet will be completely out of the question for us. On what\nday, and at what hour, don’t I advise Mr. Secundus; yet I can’t manage\nto stir him up by any advice! But it happens that all that crew are ever\nready to court his friendship, so it isn’t to be wondered that he is\nwhat he is! The truth is that he thinks the advice we give him is not\nright and proper! As you have to-day, Madame, alluded to this subject,\nI’ve got something to tell you which has weighed heavy on my mind. I’ve\nbeen anxious to come and confide it to your ladyship and to solicit your\nguidance, but I’ve been in fear and dread lest you should give way to\nsuspicion. For not only would then all my disclosures have been in vain,\nbut I would have deprived myself of even a piece of ground wherein my\nremains could be laid.”",
        "Madame Wang perceived that her remarks were prompted by some purpose.\n\"My dear child,” she eagerly urged; “go on, speak out! When I recently\nheard one and all praise you secretly behind your back, I simply fancied\nthat it was because you were careful in your attendance on Pao-yü; or\npossibly because you got on well with every one; all on account of minor\nconsiderations like these; (but I never thought it was on account of\nyour good qualities). As it happens, what you told me just now concerns,\nin all its bearings, a great principle, and is in perfect accord with my\nideas, so speak out freely, if you have aught to say! Only let no one\nelse know anything about it, that is all that is needed.”",
        "“I’ve got nothing more to say,” proceeded Hsi Jen. “My sole idea was to\nsolicit your advice, Madame, as to how to devise a plan to induce Mr.\nSecundus to move his quarters out of the garden by and bye, as things\nwill get all right then.”",
        "This allusion much alarmed Madame Wang. Speedily taking Hsi Jen’s hand\nin hers: “Is it likely,” she inquired, “that Pao-yü has been up to any\nmischief with any one?”",
        "“Don’t be too suspicious!” precipitately replied Hsi Jen. “It wasn’t at\nanything of the kind that I was hinting. I merely expressed my humble\nopinion. Mr. Secundus is a young man now, and the young ladies inside\nare no more children. More than that, Miss Lin and Miss Pao may be two\nfemale maternal first cousins of his, but albeit his cousins, there is\nnevertheless the distinction of male and female between them; and day\nand night, as they are together, it isn’t always convenient, when they\nhave to rise and when they have to sit; so this cannot help making one\ngive way to misgivings. Were, in fact, any outsider to see what’s going\non, it would not look like the propriety, which should exist in great\nfamilies. The proverb appositely says that: ’when there’s no trouble,\none should make provision for the time of trouble.’ How many concerns\nthere are in the world, of which there’s no making head or tail, mostly\nbecause what persons do without any design is construed by such\ndesigning people, as chance to have their notice attracted to it, as\nhaving been designedly accomplished, and go on talking and talking till,\ninstead of mending matters, they make them worse! But if precautions be\nnot taken beforehand, something improper will surely happen, for your\nladyship is well aware of the temperament Mr. Secundus has shown all\nalong! Besides, his great weakness is to fuss in our midst, so if no\ncaution be exercised, and the slightest mistake be sooner or later\ncommitted, there’ll be then no question of true or false: for when\npeople are many one says one thing and another, and what is there that\nthe months of that mean lot will shun with any sign of respect? Why, if\ntheir hearts be well disposed, they will maintain that he is far\nsuperior to Buddha himself. But if their hearts be badly disposed, they\nwill at once knit a tissue of lies to show that he cannot even reach the\nstandard of a beast! Now, if people by and bye speak well of Mr.\nSecundus, we’ll all go on smoothly with our lives. But should he\nperchance give reason to any one to breathe the slightest disparaging\nremark, won’t his body, needless for us to say, be smashed to pieces,\nhis bones ground to powder, and the blame, which he might incur, be made\nten thousand times more serious than it is? These things are all\ncommonplace trifles; but won’t Mr. Secundus’ name and reputation be\nsubsequently done for for life? Secondly, it’s no easy thing for your\nladyship to see anything of our master. A proverb also says: ’The\nperfect man makes provision beforehand;’ so wouldn’t it be better that\nwe should, this very minute, adopt such steps as will enable us to guard\nagainst such things? Your ladyship has much to attend to, and you\ncouldn’t, of course, think of these things in a moment. And as for us,\nit would have been well and good, had they never suggested themselves to\nour minds; but since they have, we should be the more to blame did we\nnot tell you anything about them, Madame. Of late, I have racked my\nmind, both day and night on this score; and though I couldn’t very well\nconfide to any one, my lamp alone knows everything!”",
        "After listening to these words, Madame Wang felt as if she had been\nblasted by thunder and struck by lightning; and, as they fitted so\nappositely with the incident connected with Chin Ch’uan-erh, her heart\nwas more than ever fired with boundless affection for Hsi Jen. “My dear\ngirl,” she promptly smiled, “it’s you, who are gifted with enough\nforesight to be able to think of these things so thoroughly. Yet, did I\nnot also think of them? But so busy have I been these several times that\nthey slipped from my memory. What you’ve told me to-day, however, has\nbrought me to my senses! It’s, thanks to you, that the reputation of me,\nhis mother, and of him, my son, is preserved intact! I really never had\nthe faintest idea that you were so excellent! But you had better go now;\nI know of a way. Yet, just another word. After your remarks to me, I’ll\nhand him over to your charge; please be careful of him. If you preserve\nhim from harm, it will be tantamount to preserving me from harm, and I\nshall certainly not be ungrateful to you for it.”",
        "Hsi Jen said several consecutive yes’s, and went on her way. She got\nback just in time to see Pao-yü awake. Hsi Jen explained all about the\nscented water; and, so intensely delighted was Pao-yü, that he at once\nasked that some should be mixed and brought to him to taste. In very\ndeed, he found it unusually fragrant and good. But as his heart was a\nprey to anxiety on Tai-yü’s behalf, he was full of longings to despatch\nsome one to look her up. He was, however, afraid of Hsi Jen. Readily\ntherefore he devised a plan to first get Hsi Jen out of the way, by\ndespatching her to Pao-ch’ai’s, to borrow a book. After Hsi Jen’s\ndeparture, he forthwith called Ch’ing Wen. “Go,” he said, “over to Miss\nLin’s and see what she’s up to. Should she inquire about me, all you\nneed tell her is that I’m all right.”",
        "“What shall I go empty-handed for?” rejoined Ch’ing Wen. “If I were, at\nleast, to give her a message, it would look as if I had gone for\nsomething.”",
        "“I have no message that you can give her,” added Pao-yü.",
        "“If it can’t be that,” suggested Ch’ing Wen; “I might either take\nsomething over or fetch something. Otherwise, when I get there, what\nexcuse will I be able to find?”",
        "After some cogitation, Pao-yü stretched out his hand and, laying hold of\na couple of handkerchiefs, he threw them to Ch’ing Wen. “These will do,\"\nhe smiled. “Just tell her that I bade you take them to her.”",
        "“This is strange!” exclaimed Ch’ing Wen. “Will she accept these two half\nworn-out handkerchiefs! She’ll besides get angry and say that you were\nmaking fun of her.”",
        "“Don’t worry yourself about that;” laughed Pao-yü. “She will certainly\nknow what I mean.”",
        "Ch’ing Wen, at this rejoinder, had no help but to take the handkerchiefs\nand to go to the Hsiao Hsiang lodge, where she discovered Ch’un Hsien in\nthe act of hanging out handkerchiefs on the railings to dry. As soon as\nshe saw her walk in, she vehemently waved her hand. “She’s gone to\nsleep!” she said. Ch’ing Wen, however, entered the room. It was in\nperfect darkness. There was not even so much as a lantern burning, and\nTai-yü was already ensconced in bed. “Who is there?” she shouted.",
        "“It’s Ch’ing Wen!” promptly replied Ch’ing Wen.",
        "“What are you up to?” Tai-yü inquired.",
        "“Mr. Secundus,” explained Ch’ing Wen, “sends you some handkerchiefs,\nMiss.”",
        "Tai-yü’s spirits sunk as soon as she caught her reply. “What can he have\nsent me handkerchiefs for?” she secretly reasoned within herself. “Who\ngave him these handkerchiefs?” she then asked aloud. “They must be fine\nones, so tell him to keep them and give them to some one else; for I\ndon’t need such things at present.”",
        "“They’re not new,” smiled Ch’ing Wen. “They are of an ordinary kind, and\nold.”",
        "Hearing this, Lin Tai-yü felt downcast. But after minutely searching her\nheart, she at last suddenly grasped his meaning and she hastily\nobserved: “Leave them and go your way.”",
        "Ch’ing Wen was compelled to put them down; and turning round, she betook\nherself back again. But much though she turned things over in her mind\nduring the whole of her way homewards, she did not succeed in solving\ntheir import.",
        "When Tai-yü guessed the object of the handkerchief, her very soul\nunawares flitted from her. “As Pao-yü has gone to such pains,” she\npondered, “to try and probe this dejection of mine, I have, on one hand,\nsufficient cause to feel gratified; but as there’s no knowing what my\ndejection will come to in the future there is, on the other, enough to\nmake me sad. Here he abruptly and deliberately sends me a couple of\nhandkerchiefs; and, were it not that he has divined my inmost feelings,\nthe mere sight of these handkerchiefs would be enough to make me treat\nthe whole thing as ridiculous. The secret exchange of presents between\nus,” she went on to muse, “fills me also with fears; and the thought\nthat those tears, which I am ever so fond of shedding to myself, are of\nno avail, drives me likewise to blush with shame.”",
        "And by dint of musing and reflecting, her heart began, in a moment, to\nbubble over with such excitement that, much against her will, her\nthoughts in their superabundance rolled on incessantly. So speedily\ndirecting that a lamp should be lighted, she little concerned herself\nabout avoiding suspicion, shunning the use of names, or any other such\nthings, and set to work and rubbed the ink, soaked the pen, and then\nwrote the following stanzas on the two old handkerchiefs:",
        "  Vain in my eyes the tears collect; those tears in vain they flow,\n  Which I in secret shed; they slowly drop; but for whom though?\n  The silk kerchiefs, which he so kindly troubled to give me,\n  How ever could they not with anguish and distress fill me?",
        "The second ran thus:",
        "  Like falling pearls or rolling gems, they trickle on the sly.\n  Daily I have no heart for aught; listless all day am I.\n  As on my pillow or sleeves’ edge I may not wipe them dry,\n  I let them dot by dot, and drop by drop to run freely.",
        "And the third:",
        "  The coloured thread cannot contain the pearls cov’ring my face.\n  Tears were of old at Hsiang Chiang shed, but faint has waxed each\n      trace.\n  Outside my window thousands of bamboos, lo, also grow,\n  But whether they be stained with tears or not, I do not know.",
        "Lin Tai-yü was still bent upon going on writing, but feeling her whole\nbody burn like fire, and her face scalding hot, she advanced towards the\ncheval-glass, and, raising the embroidered cover, she looked in. She saw\nat a glance that her cheeks wore so red that they, in very truth, put\neven the peach blossom to the shade. Yet little did she dream that from\nthis date her illness would assume a more serious phase. Shortly, she\nthrew herself on the bed, and, with the handkerchiefs still grasped in\nher hand, she was lost in a reverie.",
        "Putting her aside, we will now take up our story with Hsi Jen. She went\nto pay a visit to Pao-ch’ai, but as it happened, Pao-ch’ai was not in\nthe garden, but had gone to look up her mother. Hsi Jen, however, could\nnot very well come back with empty hands so she waited until the second\nwatch, when Pao-ch’ai eventually returned to her quarters.",
        "Indeed, so correct an estimate of Hsüeh P’an’s natural disposition did\nPao-ch’ai ever have, that from an early moment she entertained within\nherself some faint suspicion that it must have been Hsüeh P’an, who had\ninstigated some person or other to come and lodge a complaint against\nPao-yü. And when she also unexpectedly heard Hsi Jen’s disclosures on\nthe subject, she became more positive in her surmises. The one, who had,\nin fact, told Hsi Jen was Pei Ming. But Pei Ming too had arrived at the\nconjecture in his own mind, and could not adduce any definite proof, so\nthat every one treated his statements as founded partly on mere\nsuppositions, and partly on actual facts; but, despite this, they felt\nquite certain that it was (Hsüeh P’an) who had intrigued.",
        "Hsüeh P’an had always enjoyed this reputation; but on this particular\ninstance the harm was not, actually, his own doing; yet as every one,\nwith one consent, tenaciously affirmed that it was he, it was no easy\nmatter for him, much though he might argue, to clear himself of blame.",
        "Soon after his return, on this day, from a drinking bout out of doors,\nhe came to see his mother; but finding Pao-ch’ai in her rooms, they\nexchanged a few irrelevant remarks. “I hear,” he consequently asked,\n\"that cousin Pao-yü has got into trouble; why is it?”",
        "Mrs. Hsüeh was at the time much distressed on this score. As soon\ntherefore as she caught this question, she gnashed her teeth with rage,\nand shouted: “You good-for-nothing spiteful fellow! It’s all you who are\nat the bottom of this trouble; and do you still have the face to come\nand ply me with questions?”",
        "These words made Hsüeh P’an wince. “When did I stir up any trouble?” he\nquickly asked.",
        "“Do you still go on shamming!” cried Mrs. Hsüeh. “Every one knows full\nwell that it was you, who said those things, and do you yet\nprevaricate?”",
        "“Were every one,” insinuated Hsüeh P’an, “to assert that I had committed\nmurder, would you believe even that?”",
        "“Your very sister is well aware that they were said by you.” Mrs. Hsüeh\ncontinued, “and is it likely that she would accuse you falsely, pray?”",
        "“Mother,” promptly interposed Pao-ch’ai, “you shouldn’t be brawling with\nbrother just now! If you wait quietly, we’ll find out the plain and\nhonest truth.” Then turning towards Hsüeh P’an: “Whether it’s you, who\nsaid those things or not,” she added, “it’s of no consequence. The whole\naffair, besides, is a matter of the past, so what need is there for any\narguments; they will only be making a mountain of a mole-hill! I have\njust one word of advice to give you; don’t, from henceforward, be up to\nso much reckless mischief outside; and concern yourself a little less\nwith other people’s affairs! All you do is day after day to associate\nwith your friends and foolishly gad about! You are a happy-go-lucky sort\nof creature! If nothing happens well and good; but should by and bye\nanything turn up, every one will, though it be none of your doing,\nimagine again that you are at the bottom of it! Not to speak of others,\nwhy I myself will be the first to suspect you!”",
        "Hsüeh P’an was naturally open-hearted and plain-spoken, and could not\nbrook anything in the way of innuendoes, so, when on the one side,\nPao-ch’ai advised him not to foolishly gad about, and his mother, on the\nother, hinted that he had a foul tongue, and that he was the cause that\nPao-yü had been flogged, he at once got so exasperated that he jumped\nabout in an erratic manner and did all in his power, by vowing and\nswearing, to explain matters. “Who has,” he ejaculated, heaping abuse\nupon every one, “laid such a tissue of lies to my charge! I’d like to\ntake the teeth of that felon and pull them out! It’s clear as day that\nthey shove me forward as a target; for now that Pao-yü has been flogged\nthey find no means of making a display of their zeal. But, is Pao-yü\nforsooth the lord of the heavens that because he has had a thrashing\nfrom his father, the whole household should be fussing for days? The\nother time, he behaved improperly, and my uncle gave him two whacks. But\nour venerable ancestor came, after a time, somehow or other, I don’t\nknow how, to hear about it, and, maintaining that it was all due to Mr.\nChia Chen, she called him before her, and gave him a good blowing up.\nAnd here to-day, they have gone further, and involved me. They may drag\nme in as much as they like, I don’t fear a rap! But won’t it be better\nfor me to go into the garden, and take Pao-yü and give him a bit of my\nmind and kill him? I can then pay the penalty by laying down my life for\nhis, and one and all will enjoy peace and quiet!”",
        "While he clamoured and shouted, he looked about him for the bar of the\ndoor, and, snatching it up, he there and then was running off, to the\nconsternation of Mrs. Hsüeh, who clutched him in her arms. “You\nmurderous child of retribution!” she cried. “Whom would you go and beat?\ncome first and assail me?”",
        "From excitement Hsüeh P’an’s eyes protruded like copper bells. “What are\nyou up to,” he vociferated, “that you won’t let me go where I please,\nand that you deliberately go on calumniating me? But every day that\nPao-yü lives, the longer by that day I have to bear a false charge, so\nit’s as well that we should both die that things be cleared up?”",
        "Pao-ch’ai too hurriedly rushed forward. “Be patient a bit!” she exhorted\nhim. “Here’s mamma in an awful state of despair. Not to mention that it\nshould be for you to come and pacify her, you contrariwise kick up all\nthis rumpus! Why, saying nothing about her who is your parent, were even\na perfect stranger to advise you, it would be meant for your good! But\nthe good counsel she gave you has stirred up your monkey instead.”",
        "“From the way you’re now speaking,” Hsüeh P’an rejoined, “it must be\nyou, who said that it was I; no one else but you!”",
        "“You simply know how to feel displeased with me for speaking,” argued\nPao-ch’ai, “but you don’t feel displeased with yourself for that\nreckless way of yours of looking ahead and not minding what is behind!”",
        "“You now bear me a grudge,” Hsüeh P’an added, “for looking to what is\nahead and not to what is behind; but how is it you don’t feel indignant\nwith Pao-yü for stirring up strife and provoking trouble outside?\nLeaving aside everything else, I’ll merely take that affair of Ch’i\nKuan-erh’s, which occurred the other day, and recount it to you as an\ninstance. My friends and I came across this Ch’i Kuan-erh, ten times at\nleast, but never has he made a single intimate remark to me, and how is\nit that, as soon as he met Pao-yü the other day, he at once produced his\nsash, and gave it to him, though he did not so much as know what his\nsurname and name were? Now is it likely, forsooth, that this too was\nsomething that I started?”",
        "“Do you still refer to this?” exclaimed Mrs. Hsüeh and Pao-ch’ai, out of\npatience. “Wasn’t it about this that he was beaten? This makes it clear\nenough that it’s you who gave the thing out.”",
        "“Really, you’re enough to exasperate one to death!” Hsüeh P’an\nexclaimed. “Had you confined yourselves to saying that I had started the\nyarn, I wouldn’t have lost my temper; but what irritates me is that such\na fuss should be made for a single Pao-yü, as to subvert heaven and\nearth!”",
        "“Who fusses?” shouted Pao-ch’ai. “You are the first to arm yourself to\nthe teeth and start a row, and then you say that it’s others who are up\nto mischief!”",
        "Hsüeh P’an, seeing that every remark, made by Pao-ch’ai, contained so\nmuch reasonableness that he could with difficulty refute it, and that\nher words were even harder for him to reply to than were those uttered\nby his mother, he was consequently bent upon contriving a plan to make\nuse of such language as could silence her and compel her to return to\nher room, so as to have no one bold enough to interfere with his\nspeaking; but, his temper being up, he was not in a position to weigh\nhis speech. “Dear Sister!” he readily therefore said, “you needn’t be\nflying into a huff with me! I’ve long ago divined your feelings. Mother\ntold me some time back that for you with that gold trinket, must be\nselected some suitor provided with a jade one; as such a one will be a\nsuitable match for you. And having treasured this in your mind, and seen\nthat Pao-yü has that rubbishy thing of his, you naturally now seize\nevery occasion to screen him....”",
        "However, before he could finish, Pao-ch’ai trembled with anger, and\nclinging to Mrs. Hsüeh, she melted into tears. “Mother,” she observed,\n\"have you heard what brother says, what is it all about?”",
        "Hsüeh P’an, at the sight of his sister bathed in tears, became alive to\nthe fact that he had spoken inconsiderately, and, flying into a rage, he\nwalked away to his own quarters and retired to rest. But we can well\ndispense with any further comment on the subject.",
        "Pao-ch’ai was, at heart, full of vexation and displeasure. She meant to\ngive vent to her feelings in some way, but the fear again of upsetting\nher mother compelled her to conceal her tears. She therefore took leave\nof her parent, and went back all alone. On her return to her chamber,\nshe sobbed and sobbed throughout the whole night. The next day, she got\nout of bed, as soon as it dawned; but feeling even no inclination to\ncomb her chevelure or perform her ablutions, she carelessly adjusted her\nclothes and came out of the garden to see her mother.",
        "As luck would have it, she encountered Tai-yü standing alone under the\nshade of the trees, who inquired of her: “Where she was off to?”",
        "“I’m going home,” Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai replied. And as she uttered these\nwords, she kept on her way.",
        "But Tai-yü perceived that she was going off in a disconsolate mood; and,\nnoticing that her eyes betrayed signs of crying, and that her manner was\nunlike that of other days, she smilingly called out to her from behind:\n\"Sister, you should take care of yourself a bit. Were you even to cry so\nmuch as to fill two water jars with tears, you wouldn’t heal the wounds\ninflicted by the cane.”",
        "But as what reply Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai gave is not yet known to you, reader,\nlend an ear to the explanation contained in the next chapter.",
        "  Pai Yü-ch’uan tastes too the lotus-leaf soup.\n  Huang Chin-ying skilfully plaits the plum-blossom-knotted nets.",
        "Pao ch’ai had, our story goes, distinctly heard Lin Tai-yü’s sneer, but\nin her eagerness to see her mother and brother, she did not so much as\nturn her head round, but continued straight on her way.",
        "During this time, Lin Tai-yü halted under the shadow of the trees. Upon\ncasting a glance, in the distance towards the I Hung Yüan, she observed\nLi Kung-ts’ai, Ying Ch’un, T’an Ch’un, Hsi Ch’un and various inmates\nwending their steps in a body in the direction of the I Hung court; but\nafter they had gone past, and company after company of them had\ndispersed, she only failed to see lady Feng come. “How is it,” she\ncogitated within herself, “that she doesn’t come to see Pao-yü? Even\nsupposing that there was some business to detain her, she should also\nhave put in an appearance, so as to curry favour with our venerable\nsenior and Madame Wang. But if she hasn’t shown herself at this hour of\nthe day, there must certainly be some cause or other.”",
        "While preoccupied with conjectures, she raised her head. At a second\nglance, she discerned a crowd of people, as thick as flowers in a\nbouquet, pursuing their way also into the I Hung court. On looking\nfixedly, she recognised dowager lady Chia, leaning on lady Feng’s arm,\nfollowed by Mesdames Hsing and Wang, Mrs. Chou and servant-girls,\nmarried women and other domestics. In a body they walked into the court.\nAt the sight of them, Tai-yü unwittingly nodded her head, and reflected\non the benefit of having a father and mother; and tears forthwith again\nbedewed her face. In a while, she beheld Pao-ch’ai, Mrs. Hsüeh and the\nrest likewise go in.",
        "But at quite an unexpected moment she became aware that Tzu Chüan was\napproaching her from behind. “Miss,” she said, “you had better go and\ntake your medicine! The hot water too has got cold.”",
        "“What do you, after all, mean by keeping on pressing me so?” inquired\nTai-yü. “Whether I have it or not, what’s that to you?”",
        "“Your cough,” smiled Tzu Chüan, “has recently got a trifle better, and\nwon’t you again take your medicine? This is, it’s true, the fifth moon,\nand the weather is hot, but you should, nevertheless, take good care of\nyourself a bit! Here you’ve been at this early hour of the morning\nstanding for ever so long in this damp place; so you should go back and\nhave some rest!”",
        "This single hint recalled Tai-yü to her senses. She at length realised\nthat her legs felt rather tired. After lingering about abstractedly for\na long while, she quietly returned into the Hsiao Hsiang lodge,\nsupporting herself on Tzu Chüan. As soon as they stepped inside the\nentrance of the court, her gaze was attracted by the confused shadows of\nthe bamboos, which covered the ground, and the traces of moss, here\nthick, there thin, and she could not help recalling to mind those two\nlines of the passage in the Hsi Hsiang Chi:",
        "  “In that lone nook some one saunters about,\n  White dew coldly bespecks the verdant moss.”",
        "“Shuang Wen,” she consequently secretly communed within herself, as she\nsighed, “had of course a poor fate; but she nevertheless had a widowed\nmother and a young brother; but in the unhappy destiny, to which I,\nTai-yü, am at present doomed, I have neither a widowed mother nor a\nyoung brother.”",
        "At this point in her reflections, she was about to melt into another fit\nof crying, when of a sudden, the parrot under the verandah caught sight\nof Tai-yü approaching, and, with a shriek, he jumped down from his\nperch, and made her start with fright.",
        "“Are you bent upon compassing your own death!” she exclaimed. “You’ve\ncovered my head all over with dust again!”",
        "The parrot flew back to his perch. “Hsüeh Yen,” he kept on shouting,\n\"quick, raise the portiere! Miss is come!”",
        "Tai-yü stopped short and rapped on the frame with her hand. “Have his\nfood and water been replenished?” she asked.",
        "The parrot forthwith heaved a deep sigh, closely resembling, in sound,\nthe groans usually indulged in by Tai-yü, and then went on to recite:",
        "  “Here I am fain these flowers to inter, but humankind will laugh me as\n      a fool.\"\n  Who knows who will in years to come commit me to my grave.",
        "As soon as these lines fell on the ear of Tai-yü and Tzu Chüan, they\nblurted out laughing.",
        "“This is what you were repeating some time back, Miss.” Tzu Chüan\nlaughed, “How did he ever manage to commit it to memory?”",
        "Tai-yü then directed some one to take down the frame and suspend it\ninstead on a hook, outside the circular window, and presently entering\nher room, she seated herself inside the circular window. She had just\ndone drinking her medicine, when she perceived that the shade cast by\nthe cluster of bamboos, planted outside the window, was reflected so far\non the gauze lattice as to fill the room with a faint light, so green\nand mellow, and to impart a certain coolness to the teapoys and mats.\nBut Tai-yü had no means at hand to dispel her ennui, so from inside the\ngauze lattice, she instigated the parrot to perform his pranks; and\nselecting some verses, which had ever found favour with her, she tried\nto teach them to him.",
        "But without descending to particulars, let us now advert to Hsüeh\nPao-ch’ai. On her return home, she found her mother alone combing her\nhair and having a wash. “Why do you run over at this early hour of the\nmorning?” she speedily inquired when she saw her enter.",
        "“To see,” replied Pao-ch’ai, “whether you were all right or not, mother.\nDid he come again, I wonder, after I left yesterday and make any more\ntrouble or not?”",
        "As she spoke, she sat by her mother’s side, but unable to curb her\ntears, she began to weep.",
        "Seeing her sobbing, Mrs. Hsüeh herself could not check her feelings, and\nshe, too, burst out into a fit of crying. “My child,” she simultaneously\nexhorted her, “don’t feel aggrieved! Wait, and I’ll call that child of\nwrath to order; for were anything to happen to you, from whom will I\nhave anything to hope?”",
        "Hsüeh P’an was outside and happened to overhear their conversation, so\nwith alacrity he ran over, and facing Pao-ch’ai he made a bow, now to\nthe left and now to the right, observing the while: “My dear sister,\nforgive me this time. The fact is that I took some wine yesterday; I\ncame back late, as I met a few friends on the way. On my return home, I\nhadn’t as yet got over the fumes, so I unintentionally talked a lot of\nnonsense. But I don’t so much as remember anything about all I said. It\nisn’t worth your while, however, losing your temper over such a thing!”",
        "Pao-ch’ai was, in fact, weeping, as she covered her face, but the moment\nthis language fell on her ear, she could scarcely again refrain from\nlaughing. Forthwith raising her head, she sputtered contemptuously on\nthe ground. “You can well dispense with all this sham!” she exclaimed,\n\"I’m well aware that you so dislike us both, that you’re anxious to\ndevise some way of inducing us to part company with you, so that you may\nbe at liberty.”",
        "Hsüeh P’an, at these words, hastened to smile. “Sister,” he argued,\n\"what makes you say so? once upon a time, you weren’t so suspicious and\ngiven to uttering anything so perverse!”",
        "Mrs. Hsüeh hurriedly took up the thread of the conversation. “All you\nknow,” she interposed, “is to find fault with your sister’s remarks as\nbeing perverse; but can it be that what you said last night was the\nproper thing to say? In very truth, you were drunk!”",
        "“There’s no need for you to get angry, mother!” Hsüeh P’an rejoined,\n\"nor for you sister either; for from this day, I shan’t any more make\ncommon cause with them nor drink wine or gad about. What do you say to\nthat?”",
        "“That’s equal to an acknowledgment of your failings,” Pao-ch’ai laughed.",
        "“Could you exercise such strength of will,” added Mrs. Hsüeh, “why, the\ndragon too would lay eggs.”",
        "“If I again go and gad about with them,” Hsüeh P’an replied, “and you,\nsister, come to hear of it, you can freely spit in my face and call me a\nbeast and no human being. Do you agree to that? But why should you two\nbe daily worried; and all through me alone? For you, mother, to be angry\non my account is anyhow excusable; but for me to keep on worrying you,\nsister, makes me less then ever worthy of the name of a human being! If\nnow that father is no more, I manage, instead of showing you plenty of\nfilial piety, mamma, and you, sister, plenty of love, to provoke my\nmother to anger, and annoy my sister, why I can’t compare myself to even\na four-footed creature!”",
        "While from his mouth issued these words, tears rolled down from his\neyes; for he too found it hard to contain them.",
        "Mrs. Hsüeh had not at first been overcome by her feelings; but the\nmoment his utterances reached her ear, she once more began to experience\nthe anguish, which they stirred in her heart.",
        "Pao-ch’ai made an effort to force a smile. “You’ve already,” she said,\n\"been the cause of quite enough trouble, and do you now provoke mother\nto have another cry?”",
        "Hearing this, Hsüeh P’an promptly checked his tears. As he put on a\nsmiling expression, “When did I,” he asked, “make mother cry? But never\nmind; enough of this! let’s drop the matter, and not allude to it any\nmore! Call Hsiang Ling to come and give you a cup of tea, sister!”",
        "“I don’t want any tea.” Pao-ch’ai answered. “I’ll wait until mother has\nfinished washing her hands and then go with her into the garden.”",
        "“Let me see your necklet, sister,” Hsüeh P’an continued. “I think it\nrequires cleaning.”",
        "“It is so yellow and bright,” rejoined Pao-ch’ai, “and what’s the use of\ncleaning it again?”",
        "“Sister,” proceeded Hsüeh P’an, “you must now add a few more clothes to\nyour wardrobe, so tell me what colour and what design you like best.”",
        "“I haven’t yet worn out all the clothes I have,” Pao-ch’ai explained,\n\"and why should I have more made?”",
        "But, in a little time, Mrs. Hsüeh effected the change in her costume,\nand hand in hand with Pao-ch’ai, she started on her way to the garden.",
        "Hsüeh P’an thereupon took his departure. During this while, Mrs. Hsüeh\nand Pao-ch’ai trudged in the direction of the garden to look up Pao-yü.\nAs soon as they reached the interior of the I Hung court, they saw a\nlarge concourse of waiting-maids and matrons standing inside as well as\noutside the antechambers and they readily concluded that old lady Chia\nand the other ladies were assembled in his rooms. Mrs. Hsüeh and her\ndaughter stepped in. After exchanging salutations with every one\npresent, they noticed that Pao-yü was reclining on the couch and Mrs.\nHsüeh inquired of him whether he felt any better.",
        "Pao-yü hastily attempted to bow. “I’m considerably better;” he said.\n\"All I do,” he went on, “is to disturb you, aunt, and you, my cousin,\nbut I don’t deserve such attentions.”",
        "Mrs. Hsüeh lost no time in supporting and laying him down. “Mind you\ntell me whatever may take your fancy!” she proceeded.",
        "“If I do fancy anything,” retorted Pao-yü smilingly, “I shall certainly\nsend to you, aunt, for it.”",
        "“What would you like to eat,” likewise inquired Madame Wang, “so that I\nmay, on my return, send it round to you?”",
        "“There’s nothing that I care for,” smiled Pao-yü, “though the soup made\nfor me the other day, with young lotus leaves, and small lotus cores\nwas, I thought, somewhat nice.”",
        "“From what I hear, its flavour is nothing very grand,” lady Feng chimed\nin laughingly, from where she stood on one side. “It involves, however,\na good deal of trouble to concoct; and here you deliberately go and\nfancy this very thing.”",
        "“Go and get it ready!” cried dowager lady Chia several successive times.",
        "“Venerable ancestor,” urged lady Feng with a smile, “don’t you bother\nyourself about it! Let me try and remember who can have put the moulds\naway!” Then turning her head round, “Go and bid,” she enjoined an old\nmatron, “the chief in the cook-house go and apply for them!”",
        "After a considerable lapse of time, the matron returned. “The chief in\nthe cook-house,” she explained, “says that the four sets of moulds for\nsoups have all been handed up.”",
        "Upon hearing this, lady Feng thought again for a while. “Yes, I\nremember,” she afterwards remarked, “they were handed up, but I can’t\nrecollect to whom they were given. Possibly they’re in the tea-room.”",
        "Thereupon, she also despatched a servant to go and inquire of the keeper\nof the tea-room about them; but he too had not got them; and it was\nsubsequently the butler, entrusted with the care of the gold and silver\narticles, who brought them round.",
        "Mrs. Hsüeh was the first to take them and examine them. What, in fact,\nstruck her gaze was a small box, the contents of which were four sets of\nsilver moulds. Each of these was over a foot long, and one square inch\n(in breadth). On the top, holes were bored of the size of beans. Some\nresembled chrysanthemums, others plum blossom. Some were in the shape of\nlotus seed-cases, others like water chestnuts. They numbered in all\nthirty or forty kinds, and were ingeniously executed.",
        "“In your mansion,” she felt impelled to observe smilingly to old lady\nChia and Madame Wang, “everything has been amply provided for! Have you\ngot all these things to prepare a plate of soup with! Hadn’t you told\nme, and I happened to see them, I wouldn’t have been able to make out\nwhat they were intended for!”",
        "Lady Feng did not allow time to any one to put in her word. “Aunt,” she\nsaid, “how could you ever have divined that these were used last year\nfor the imperial viands! They thought of a way by which they devised,\nsomehow or other, I can’t tell how, some dough shapes, which borrow a\nlittle of the pure fragrance of the new lotus leaves. But as all mainly\ndepends upon the quality of the soup, they’re not, after all, of much\nuse! Yet who often goes in for such soup! It was made once only, and\nthat at the time when the moulds were brought; and how is it that he has\ncome to think of it to-day?” So speaking, she took (the moulds), and\nhanded them to a married woman, to go and issue directions to the people\nin the cook-house to procure at once several fowls, and to add other\ningredients besides and prepare ten bowls of soup.",
        "“What do you want all that lot for?” observed Madame Wang.",
        "“There’s good reason for it,” answered lady Feng. “A dish of this kind\nisn’t, at ordinary times, very often made, and were, now that brother\nPao-yü has alluded to it, only sufficient prepared for him, and none for\nyou, dear senior, you, aunt, and you, Madame Wang, it won’t be quite the\nthing! So isn’t it better that this opportunity should be availed of to\nget ready a whole supply so that every one should partake of some, and\nthat even I should, through my reliance on your kind favour, taste this\nnovel kind of relish.”",
        "“You are sharper than a monkey!” Dowager lady Chia laughingly exclaimed\nin reply to her proposal. “You make use of public money to confer boons\nupon people.”",
        "This remark evoked general laughter.",
        "“This is a mere bagatelle!” eagerly laughed lady Feng. “Even I can\nafford to stand you such a small treat!” Then turning her head round,\n\"Tell them in the cook-house,” she said to a married woman, “to please\nmake an extra supply, and that they’ll get the money from me.”",
        "The matron assented and went out of the room.",
        "Pao-ch’ai, who was standing near, thereupon interposed with a smile.\n\"During the few years that have gone by since I’ve come here, I’ve\ncarefully noticed that sister-in-law Secunda, cannot, with all her\nacumen, outwit our venerable ancestor.”",
        "“My dear child!” forthwith replied old lady Chia at these words. “I’m\nnow quite an old woman, and how can there still remain any wit in me!\nWhen I was, long ago, of your manlike cousin Feng’s age, I had far more\nwits about me than she has! Albeit she now avers that she can’t reach\nour standard, she’s good enough; and compared with your aunt Wang, why,\nshe’s infinitely superior. Your aunt, poor thing, won’t speak much!\nShe’s like a block of wood; and when with her father and mother-in-law,\nshe won’t show herself off to advantage. But that girl Feng has a sharp\ntongue, so is it a wonder if people take to her.”",
        "“From what you say,” insinuated Pao-yü with a smile, “those who don’t\ntalk much are not loved.”",
        "“Those who don’t speak much,” resumed dowager lady Chia, “possess the\nendearing quality of reserve. But among those, with glib tongues,\nthere’s also a certain despicable lot; thus it’s better, in a word, not\nto have too much to say for one’s self.”",
        "“Quite so,” smiled Pao-yü, “yet though senior sister-in-law Chia Chu\ndoesn’t, I must confess, talk much, you, venerable ancestor, treat her\njust as you do cousin Feng. But if you maintain that those alone, who\ncan talk, are worthy of love, then among all these young ladies, sister\nFeng and cousin Lin are the only ones good enough to be loved.”",
        "“With regard to the young ladies,” remarked dowager lady Chia, “it isn’t\nthat I have any wish to flatter your aunt Hsüeh in her presence, but it\nis a positive and incontestable fact that there isn’t, beginning from\nthe four girls in our household, a single one able to hold a candle to\nthat girl Pao-ch’ai.”",
        "At these words, Mrs. Hsüeh promptly smiled. “Dear venerable senior!” she\nsaid, “you’re rather partial in your verdict.”",
        "“Our dear senior,” vehemently put in Madame Wang, also smiling, “has\noften told me in private how nice your daughter Pao-ch’ai is; so this is\nno lie.”",
        "Pao-yü had tried to lead old lady Chia on, originally with the idea of\ninducing her to speak highly of Lin Tai-yü, but when unawares she began\nto eulogise Pao-ch’ai instead the result exceeded all his thoughts and\nwent far beyond his expectations. Forthwith he cast a glance at\nPao-chai, and gave her a smile, but Pao-chai at once twisted her head\nround and went and chatted with Hsi Jen. But of a sudden, some one came\nto ask them to go and have their meal. Dowager lady Chia rose to her\nfeet, and enjoined Pao-yü to be careful of himself. She then gave a few\ndirections to the waiting-maids, and resting her weight on lady Feng’s\narm, and pressing Mrs. Hsüeh to go out first, she, and all with her,\nleft the apartment in a body. But still she kept on inquiring whether\nthe soup was ready or not. “If there’s anything you might fancy to eat,\"\nshe also said to Mrs. Hsüeh and the others, “mind you, come and tell me,\nand I know how to coax that hussey Feng to get it for you as well as\nme.”",
        "“My venerable senior!” rejoined Mrs. Hsüeh, “you do have the happy knack\nof putting her on her mettle; but though she has often got things ready\nfor you, you’ve, after all, not eaten very much of them.”",
        "“Aunt,” smiled lady Feng, “don’t make such statements! If our worthy\nsenior hasn’t eaten me up it’s purely and simply because she dislikes\nhuman flesh as being sour. Did she not look down upon it as sour, why,\nshe would long ago have gobbled me up!”",
        "This joke was scarcely ended, when it so tickled the fancy of old lady\nChia and all the inmates that they broke out with one voice in a\nboisterous fit of laughter. Even Pao-yü, who was inside the room, could\nnot keep quiet.",
        "“Really,” Hsi Jen laughed, “the mouth of our mistress Secunda is enough\nto terrify people to death!”",
        "Pao-yü put out his arm and pulled Hsi Jen. “You’ve been standing for so\nlong,” he smiled, “that you must be feeling tired.”",
        "Saying this, he dragged her down and made her take a seat next to him.",
        "“Here you’ve again forgotten!” laughingly exclaimed Hsi Jen. “Avail\nyourself now that Miss Pao-ch’ai is in the court to tell her to kindly\nbid their Ying Erh come and plait a few girdles with twisted cords.”",
        "“How lucky it is you’ve reminded me?” Pao-yü observed with a smile. And\nputting, while he spoke, his head out of the window: “Cousin Pao-ch’ai,\"\nhe cried, “when you’ve had your repast, do tell Ying Erh to come over. I\nwould like to ask her to plait a few girdles for me. Has she got the\ntime to spare?”",
        "Pao-ch’ai heard him speak; and turning round: “How about no time?” she\nanswered. “I’ll tell her by and bye to come; it will be all right.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia and the others, however, failed to catch distinctly\nthe drift of their talk; and they halted and made inquiries of Pao-ch’ai\nwhat it was about. Pao-ch’ai gave them the necessary explanations.",
        "“My dear child,” remarked old lady Chia, “do let her come and twist a\nfew girdles for your cousin! And should you be in need of any one for\nanything, I have over at my place a whole number of servant-girls doing\nnothing! Out of them, you are at liberty to send for any you like to\nwait on you!”",
        "“We’ll send her to plait them!” Mrs. Hsüeh and Pao-ch’ai observed\nsmilingly with one consent. “What can we want her for? she also daily\nidles her time way and is up to every mischief!”",
        "But chatting the while, they were about to proceed on their way when\nthey unexpectedly caught sight of Hsiang-yün, P’ing Erh, Hsiang Lin and\nother girls picking balsam flowers near the rocks; who, as soon as they\nsaw the company approaching, advanced to welcome them.",
        "Shortly, they all sallied out of the garden. Madame Wang was worrying\nlest dowager lady Chia’s strength might be exhausted, and she did her\nutmost to induce her to enter the drawing room and sit down. Old lady\nChia herself was feeling her legs quite tired out, so she at once nodded\nher head and expressed her assent. Madame Wang then directed a\nwaiting-maid to hurriedly precede them, and get ready the seats. But as\nMrs. Chao had, about this time, pleaded indisposition, there was only\ntherefore Mrs. Chou, with the matrons and servant-girls at hand, so they\nhad ample to do to raise the portières, to put the back-cushions in\ntheir places, and to spread out the rugs.",
        "Dowager lady Chia stepped into the room, leaning on lady Feng’s arm. She\nand Mrs. Hsüeh took their places, with due regard to the distinction\nbetween hostess and visitors; and Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai and Shih Hsiang-yün\nseated themselves below. Madame Wang then came forward, and presented\nwith her own hands tea to old lady Chia, while Li Kung-ts’ai handed a\ncup to Mrs. Hsüeh.",
        "“You’d better let those young sisters-in law do the honours,\"\nremonstrated old lady Chia, “and sit over there so that we may be able\nto have a chat.”",
        "Madame Wang at length sat on a small bench. “Let our worthy senior’s\nviands,” she cried, addressing herself to lady Feng, “be served here.\nAnd let a few more things be brought!”",
        "Lady Feng acquiesced without delay, and she told a servant to cross over\nto their old mistress’ quarters and to bid the matrons, employed in that\npart of the household, promptly go out and summon the waiting-girls. The\nvarious waiting-maids arrived with all despatch. Madame Wang directed\nthem to ask their young ladies round. But after a protracted absence on\nthe errand, only two of the girls turned up: T’an Ch’un and Hsi Ch’un.\nYing Ch’un, was not, in her state of health, equal to the fatigue, or\nable to put anything in her mouth, and Lin Tai-yü, superfluous to add,\ncould only safely partake of five out of ten meals, so no one thought\nanything of their non-appearance. Presently the eatables were brought,\nand the servants arranged them in their proper places on the table.",
        "Lady Feng took a napkin and wrapped a bundle of chopsticks in it.\n\"Venerable ancestor and you, Mrs. Hsüeh,” she smiled, standing the while\nbelow, “there’s no need of any yielding! Just you listen to me and I’ll\nmake things all right.”",
        "“Let’s do as she wills!” old lady Chia remarked to Mrs. Hsüeh\nlaughingly.",
        "Mrs. Hsüeh signified her approval with a smile; so lady Feng placed, in\ndue course, four pairs of chopsticks on the table; the two pairs on the\nupper end for dowager lady Chia and Mrs. Hsüeh; those on the two sides\nfor Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai and Shih Hsiang-yün. Madame Wang, Li Kung-ts’ai and\na few others, stood together below and watched the attendants serve the\nviands. Lady Feng first and foremost hastily asked for clean utensils,\nand drew near the table to select some eatables for Pao-yü. Presently,\nthe soup à la lotus leaves arrived. After old lady Chia had well\nscrutinised it, Madame Wang turned her head, and catching sight of Yü\nCh’uan-erh, she immediately commissioned her to take some over to\nPao-yü.",
        "“She can’t carry it single-handed,” demurred lady Feng.",
        "But by a strange coincidence, Ying Erh then walked into the room along\nwith Hsi Erh, and Pao-ch’ai knowing very well that they had already had\ntheir meal forthwith said to Ying Erh: “Your Master Secundus, Mr.\nPao-yü, just asked that you should go and twist a few girdles for him;\nso you two might as well proceed together!”",
        "Ying Erh expressed her readiness and left the apartment, in company with\nYü Ch’uan-erh.",
        "“How can you carry it, so very hot as it is, the whole way there?\"\nobserved Ying Erh.",
        "“Don’t distress yourself!” rejoined Yü Ch’uan smiling. “I know how to do\nit.”",
        "Saying this, she directed a matron to come and place the soup, rice and\nthe rest of the eatables in a present box; and bidding her lay hold of\nit and follow them, the two girls sped on their way with empty hands,\nand made straight for the entrance of the I Hung court. Here Yü\nCh’uan-erh at length took the things herself, and entered the room in\ncompany with Ying Erh. The trio, Hsi Jen, She Yüeh and Ch’iu Wen were at\nthe time chatting and laughing with Pao-yü; but the moment they saw\ntheir two friends arrive they speedily jumped to their feet. “How is\nit,” they exclaimed laughingly, “that you two drop in just the nick of\ntime? Have you come together?”",
        "With these words on their lips, they descended to greet them. Yü Ch’uan\ntook at once a seat on a small stool. Ying Erh, however, did not presume\nto seat herself; and though Hsi Jen was quick enough in moving a\nfoot-stool for her, Ying Erh did not still venture to sit down.",
        "Ying Erh’s arrival filled Pao-yü with intense delight. But as soon as he\nnoticed Yü Ch’uan-erh, he recalled to memory her sister Chin Ch’uan-erh,\nand he felt wounded to the very heart, and overpowered with shame. And,\nwithout troubling his mind about Ying Erh, he addressed his remarks to\nYü Ch’uan-erh.",
        "Hsi Jen saw very well that Ying Erh failed to attract his attention and\nshe began to fear lest she felt uncomfortable; and when she further\nrealised that Ying Erh herself would not take a seat, she drew her out\nof the room and repaired with her into the outer apartment, where they\nhad a chat over their tea.",
        "She Yüeh and her companions had, in the meantime, got the bowls and\nchopsticks ready and came to wait upon (Pao-yü) during his meal. But\nPao-yü would not have anything to eat. “Is your mother all right,” he\nforthwith inquired of Yü Ch’uan-erh.",
        "An angry scowl crept over Yü Ch’uan-erh’s face. She did not even look\nstraight at Pao-yü. And only after a long pause was it that she at last\nuttered merely the words, “all right,” by way of reply. Pao-yü,\ntherefore, found talking to her of little zest. But after a protracted\nsilence he felt impelled to again force a smile, and to ask: “Who told\nyou to bring these things over to me?”",
        "“The ladies,” answered Yü Chuan-erh.",
        "Pao-yü discerned the mournful expression, which still beclouded her\ncountenance and he readily jumped at the conclusion that it must be\nentirely occasioned by the fate which had befallen Chin Ch’uan-erh, but\nwhen fain to put on a meek and unassuming manner, and endeavour to cheer\nher, he saw how little he could demean himself in the presence of so\nmany people, and consequently he did his best and discovered the means\nof getting every one out of the way. Afterwards, straining another\nsmile, he plied her with all sorts of questions.",
        "Yü Ch’uan-erh, it is true, did not at first choose to heed his advances,\nyet when she observed that Pao-yü did not put on any airs, and, that in\nspite of all her querulous reproaches, he still continued pleasant and\nagreeable, she felt disconcerted and her features at last assumed a\ncertain expression of cheerfulness. Pao-yü thereupon smiled. “My dear\ngirl,” he said, as he gave way to entreaties, “bring that soup and let\nme taste it!”",
        "“I’ve never been in the habit of feeding people,” Yü Ch’uan-erh replied.\n\"You’d better wait till the others return; you can have some then.”",
        "“I don’t want you to feed me,” laughed Pao-yü. “It’s because I can’t\nmove about that I appeal to you. Do let me have it! You’ll then get back\nearly and be able, when you’ve handed over the things, to have your\nmeal. But were I to go on wasting your time, won’t you feel upset from\nhunger? Should you be lazy to budge, well then, I’ll endure the pain and\nget down and fetch it myself.”",
        "As he spoke, he tried to alight from bed. He strained every nerve, and\nraised himself, but unable to stand the exertion, he burst out into\ngroans. At the sight of his anguish, Yü Ch’uan-erh had not the heart to\nrefuse her help. Springing up, “Lie down!” she cried. “In what former\nexistence did you commit such evil that your retribution in the present\none is so apparent? Which of my eyes however can brook looking at you\ngoing on in that way?”",
        "While taunting him, she again blurted out laughing, and brought the soup\nover to him.",
        "“My dear girl;” smiled Pao-yü, “if you want to show temper, better do so\nhere! When you see our venerable senior and madame, my mother, you\nshould be a little more even-tempered, for if you still behave like\nthis, you’ll at once get a scolding!”",
        "“Eat away, eat away!” urged Yü Ch’uan-erh. “There’s no need for you to\nbe so sweet-mouthed and honey-tongued with me. I don’t put any faith in\nsuch talk!”",
        "So speaking, she pressed Pao-yü until he had two mouthfuls of soup. “It\nisn’t nice, it isn’t nice!” Pao-yü purposely exclaimed.",
        "“Omi-to-fu!” ejaculated Yü Ch’uan-erh. “If this isn’t nice, what’s\nnice?”",
        "“There’s no flavour about it at all,” resumed Pao-yü. “If you don’t\nbelieve me taste it, and you’ll find out for yourself.”",
        "Yü Ch’uan-erh in a tantrum actually put some of it to her lips.",
        "“Well,” laughed Pao-yü, “it is nice!”",
        "This exclamation eventually enabled Yü Ch’uan to see what Pao-yü was\ndriving at, for Pao-yü had in fact been trying to beguile her to have a\nmouthful.",
        "“As, at one moment, you say you don’t want any,” she forthwith observed,\n\"and now you say it is nice, I won’t give you any.”",
        "While Pao-yü returned her smiles, he kept on earnestly entreating her to\nlet him have some.",
        "Yü Ch’uan-erh however would still not give him any; and she, at the same\ntime, called to the servants to fetch what there was for him to eat. But\nthe instant the waiting-maid put her foot into the room, servants came\nquite unexpectedly to deliver a message.",
        "“Two nurses,” they said, “have arrived from the household of Mr. Fu,\nSecundus, to present his compliments. They have now come to see you, Mr.\nSecundus.” As soon as Pao-yü heard this report, he felt sure that they\nmust be nurses sent over from the household of Deputy Sub-Prefect, Fu\nShih.",
        "This Fu Shih had originally been a pupil of Chia Cheng, and had, indeed,\nhad to rely entirely upon the reputation enjoyed by the Chia family for\nthe realisation of his wishes. Chia Cheng had, likewise, treated him\nwith such genuine regard, and so unlike any of his other pupils, that he\n(Fu Shih) ever and anon despatched inmates from his mansion to come and\nsee him so as to keep up friendly relations.",
        "Pao-yü had at all times entertained an aversion for bold-faced men and\nunsophisticated women, so why did he once more, on this occasion, issue\ndirections that the two matrons should be introduced into his presence?\nThere was, in fact, a reason for his action. It was simply that Pao-yü\nhad come to learn that Fu Shih had a sister, Ch’iu-fang by name, a girl\nas comely as a magnificent gem, and perfection itself, the report of\noutside people went, as much in intellect as in beauty. He had, it is\ntrue, not yet seen anything of her with his own eyes, but the\nsentiments, which made him think of her and cherish her, from a\ndistance, were characterised by such extreme sincerity, that dreading\nlest he should, by refusing to admit the matrons, reflect discredit upon\nFu Ch’iu-fang, he was prompted to lose no time in expressing a wish that\nthey should be ushered in.",
        "This Fu Shih had really risen from the vulgar herd, so seeing that\nCh’iu-fang possessed several traits of beauty and exceptional\nintellectual talents, Fu Shih arrived at the resolution of making his\nsister the means of joining relationship with the influential family of\nsome honourable clan. And so unwilling was he to promise her lightly to\nany suitor that things were delayed up to this time. Therefore Fu\nCh’iu-fang, though at present past her twentieth birthday, was not as\nyet engaged. But the various well-to-do families, belonging to\nhonourable clans, looked down, on the other hand, on her poor and mean\nextraction, holding her in such light esteem, as not to relish the idea\nof making any offer for her hand. So if Fu Shih cultivated intimate\nterms with the Chia household, he, needless to add, did so with an\ninterested motive.",
        "The two matrons, deputed on the present errand, completely lacked, as it\nhappened, all knowledge of the world, and the moment they heard that\nPao-yü wished to see them, they wended their steps inside. But no sooner\nhad they inquired how he was, and passed a few remarks than Yü\nCh’uan-erh, becoming conscious of the arrival of strangers, did not\nbandy words with Pao-yü, but stood with the plate of soup in her hands,\nengrossed in listening to the conversation. Pao-yü, again, was absorbed\nin speaking to the matrons; and, while eating some rice, he stretched\nout his arm to get at the soup; but both his and her (Yü Ch’uan-erh’s)\neyes were rivetted on the women, and as he thoughtlessly jerked out his\nhand with some violence, he struck the bowl and turned it clean over.\nThe soup fell over Pao-yü’s hand. But it did not hurt Yü Ch’uan-erh. She\nsustained, however, such a fright that she gave a start.",
        "“How did this happen!” she smilingly shouted with vehemence to the\nintense consternation of the waiting-maids, who rushed up and clasped\nthe bowl. But notwithstanding that Pao-yü had scalded his own hand, he\nwas quite unconscious of the accident; so much so, that he assailed Yü\nCh’uan-erh with a heap of questions, as to where she had been burnt, and\nwhether it was sore or not.",
        "Yü Ch’uan-erh and every one present were highly amused.",
        "“You yourself,” observed Yü Ch’uan-erh, “have been scalded, and do you\nkeep on asking about myself?”",
        "At these words, Pao-yü became at last aware of the injury he had\nreceived. The servants rushed with all promptitude and cleared the mess.\nBut Pao-yü was not inclined to touch any more food. He washed his hands,\ndrank a cup of tea, and then exchanged a few further sentences with the\ntwo matrons. But subsequently, the two women said good-bye and quitted\nthe room. Ch’ing Wen and some other girls saw them as far as the bridge,\nafter which, they retraced their steps.",
        "The two matrons perceived, that there was no one about, and while\nproceeding on their way, they started a conversation.",
        "“It isn’t strange,” smiled the one, “if people say that this Pao-yü of\ntheirs is handsome in appearance, but stupid as far as brains go. Nice\nenough a thing to look at but not to put to one’s lips; rather idiotic\nin fact; for he burns his own hand, and then he asks some one else\nwhether she’s sore or not. Now, isn’t this being a regular fool?”",
        "“The last time I came,” the other remarked, also smiling, “I heard that\nmany inmates of his family feel ill-will against him. In real truth he\nis a fool! For there he drips in the heavy downpour like a water fowl,\nand instead of running to shelter himself, he reminds other people of\nthe rain, and urges them to get quick out of the wet. Now, tell me,\nisn’t this ridiculous, eh? Time and again, when no one is present, he\ncries to himself, then laughs to himself. When he sees a swallow, he\ninstantly talks to it; when he espies a fish, in the river, he forthwith\nspeaks to it. At the sight of stars or the moon, if he doesn’t groan and\nsigh, he mutters and mutters. Indeed, he hasn’t the least bit of\ncharacter; so much so, that he even puts up with the temper shown by\nthose low-bred maids. If he takes a fancy to a thing, it’s nice enough\neven though it be a bit of thread. But as for waste, what does he mind?\nA thing may be worth a thousand or ten thousand pieces of money, he\ndoesn’t worry his mind in the least about it.”",
        "While they talked, they reached the exterior of the garden, and they\nbetook themselves back to their home; where we will leave them.",
        "As soon as Hsi Jen, for we will return to her, saw the women leave the\nroom, she took Ying Erh by the hand and led her in, and they asked\nPao-yü what kind of girdle he wanted made.",
        "“I was just now so bent upon talking,” Pao-yü smiled to Ying Erh, “that\nI forgot all about you. I put you to the trouble of coming, not for\nanything else, but that you should also make me a few nets.”",
        "“Nets! To put what in?” Ying Erh inquired.",
        "Pao-yü, at this question, put on a smile. “Don’t concern yourself about\nwhat they are for!” he replied. “Just make me a few of each kind!”",
        "Ying Erh clapped her hand and laughed. “Could this ever be done!” she\ncried, “If you want all that lot, why, they couldn’t be finished in ten\nyears time.”",
        "“My dear girl,” smiled Pao-yü, “work at them for me then whenever you\nare at leisure, and have nothing better to do.”",
        "“How could you get through them all in a little time?” Hsi Jen\ninterposed smilingly. “First choose now therefore such as are most\nurgently needed and make a couple of them.”",
        "“What about urgently needed?” Ying-Erh exclaimed, “They are merely used\nfor fans, scented pendants and handkerchiefs.”",
        "“Nets for handkerchiefs will do all right.” Pao-yü answered.",
        "“What’s the colour of your handkerchief?” inquired Ying Erh.",
        "“It’s a deep red one.” Pao-yü rejoined.",
        "“For a deep red one,” continued Ying Erh, “a black net will do very\nnicely, or one of dark green. Both these agree with the colour.”",
        "“What goes well with brown?” Pao-yü asked.",
        "“Peach-red goes well with brown.” Ying Erh added.",
        "“That will make them look gaudy!” Pao-yü observed. “Yet with all their\nplainness, they should be somewhat gaudy.”",
        "“Leek-green and willow-yellow are what are most to my taste,” Ying Erh\npursued.",
        "“Yes, they’ll also do!” Pao-yü retorted. “But make one of peach-red too\nand then one of leek-green.”",
        "“Of what design?” Ying Erh remarked.",
        "“How many kinds of designs are there?” Pao-yü said.",
        "“There are ’the stick of incense,’ ’stools upset towards heaven,’ ’part\nof elephant’s eyes,’ ’squares,’ ’chains,’ ’plum blossom,’ and ’willow\nleaves.” Ying Erh answered.",
        "“What was the kind of design you made for Miss Tertia the other day?\"\nPao-yü inquired.",
        "“It was the ’plum blossom with piled cores,’” Ying Erh explained in\nreply.",
        "“Yes, that’s nice.” Pao-yü rejoined.",
        "As he uttered this remark, Hsi Jen arrived with the cords. But no sooner\nwere they brought than a matron cried, from outside the window: “Girls,\nyour viands are ready!”",
        "“Go and have your meal,” urged Pao-yü, “and come back quick after you’ve\nhad it.”",
        "“There are visitors here,” Hsi Jen smiled, “and how can I very well go?”",
        "“What makes you say so?” Ying Erh laughed, while adjusting the cords.\n\"It’s only right and proper that you should go and have your food at\nonce and then return.”",
        "Hearing this, Hsi Jen and her companions went off, leaving behind only\ntwo youthful servant-girls to answer the calls.",
        "Pao-yü watched Ying Erh make the nets. But, while keeping his eyes\nintent on her, he talked at the same time of one thing and then another,\nand next went on to ask her how far she was in her teens.",
        "Ying Erh continued plaiting. “I’m sixteen,” she simultaneously rejoined.",
        "“What was your original surname?” Pao-yü added.",
        "“It was Huang;” answered Ying Erh.",
        "“That’s just the thing,” Pao-yü smiled; “for in real truth there’s the\n’Huang Ying-erh;’ (oriole).”",
        "“My name, at one time, consisted of two characters,” continued Ying Erh.\n\"I was called Chin Ying; but Miss Pao-ch’ai didn’t like it, as it was\ndifficult to pronounce, and only called me Ying Erh; so now I’ve come to\nbe known under that name.”",
        "“One can very well say that cousin Pao-ch’ai is fond of you!” Pao-yü\npursued. “By and bye, when she gets married, she’s sure to take you\nalong with her.”",
        "Ying Erh puckered up her lips, and gave a significant smile.",
        "“I’ve often told Hsi Jen,” Pao-yü smiled, “that I can’t help wondering\nwho’ll shortly be the lucky ones to win your mistress and yourself.”",
        "“You aren’t aware,” laughed Ying Erh, “that our young mistress possesses\nseveral qualities not to be found in a single person in this world; her\nface is a second consideration.”",
        "Pao-yü noticed how captivating Ying Erh’s tone of voice was, how\ncomplaisant she was, and how simpleton-like unaffected in her language\nand smiles, and he soon felt the warmest affection for her; and\nparticularly so, when she started the conversation about Pao-ch’ai.\n\"Where do her qualities lie?” he readily inquired. “My dear girl, please\ntell me!”",
        "“If I tell you,” said Ying Erh, “you must, on no account, let her know\nanything about it again.”",
        "“This goes without saying,” smiled Pao-yü.",
        "But this answer was still on his lips, when they overheard some one\noutside remark: “How is it that everything is so quiet?”",
        "Both gazed round to see who possibly it could be. They discovered,\nstrange enough, no one else than Pao-ch’ai herself.",
        "Pao-yü hastily offered her a seat. Pao-ch’ai seated herself, and then\nwanted to know what Ying Erh was busy plaiting. Inquiring the while, she\r\napproached her and scrutinised what she held in her hands, half of which\nhad by this time been done. “What’s the fun of a thing like this?” she\nsaid. “Wouldn’t it be preferable to plait a net, and put the jade in\nit?”",
        "This allusion suggested the idea to Pao-yü. Speedily clapping his hands,\nhe smiled and exclaimed: “Your idea is splendid, cousin. I’d forgotten\nall about it! The only thing is what colour will suit it best?”",
        "“It will never do to use mixed colours,” Pao-ch’ai rejoined. “Deep red\nwill, on one hand, clash with the colour; while yellow is not pleasing\nto the eye; and black, on the other hand, is too sombre. But wait, I’ll\ntry and devise something. Bring that gold cord and use it with the black\nbeaded cord; and if you twist one of each together, and make a net with\nthem, it will look very pretty!”",
        "Upon hearing this, Pao-yü was immeasurably delighted, and time after\ntime he shouted to the servants to fetch the gold cord. But just at that\nmoment Hsi Jen stepped in, with two bowls of eatables. “How very strange\nthis is to-day!” she said to Pao-yü. “Why, a few minutes back, my\nmistress, your mother, sent some one to bring me two bowls of viands.”",
        "“The supply,” replied Pao-yü smiling, “must have been so plentiful\nto-day, that they’ve sent some to every one of you.”",
        "“It isn’t that,” continued Hsi Jen, “for they were distinctly given to\nme by name. What’s more, I wasn’t bidden go and knock my head; so this\nis indeed remarkable!”",
        "“If they’re given to you,” Pao-yü smiled, “why, you had better go and\neat them. What’s there in this to fill you with conjectures?”",
        "“There’s never been anything like this before,” Hsi Jen added, “so, it\nmakes me feel uneasy.”",
        "Pao-ch’ai compressed her lips. “If this,” she laughed; “makes you fell\nuneasy, there will be by and bye other things to make you far more\nuneasy.”",
        "Hsi Jen realised that she implied something by her insinuations, as she\nknew from past experience that Pao-ch’ai was not one given to lightly\nand contemptuously poking fun at people; and, remembering the notions\nentertained by Madame Wang on the last occasion she had seen her, she\ndropped at once any further allusions to the subject and brought the\neatables up to Pao-yü for his inspection. “I shall come and hold the\ncords,” she observed, “as soon as I’ve rinsed my hands.”",
        "This said, she immediately quitted the apartment. After her meal, she\nwashed her hands and came inside to hold the gold cords for Ying Erh to\nplait the net with.",
        "By this time, Pao-ch’ai had been called away by a servant, despatched by\nHsüeh P’an. But while Pao-yü was watching the net that was being made he\ncaught sight, at a moment least expected, of two servant-girls, who came\nfrom the part of Madame Hsing of the other mansion, to bring him a few\nkinds of fruits, and to inquire whether he was able to walk. “If you can\ngo about,” they told him, “(our mistress) desires you, Mr. Pao-yü, to\ncross over to-morrow and have a little distraction. Her ladyship really\nlongs to see you.”",
        "“Were I able to walk,” Pao-yü answered with alacrity, “I would feel it\nmy duty to go and pay my respects to your mistress! Anyhow, the pain is\nbetter than before, so request your lady to allay her solicitude.”",
        "As he bade them both sit down, he, at the same time, called Ch’iu Wen.\n\"Take,” he said to her, “half of the fruits, just received, to Miss Lin\nas a present.”",
        "Ch’iu Wen signified her obedience, and was about to start on her errand,\nwhen she heard Tai-yü talking in the court, and Pao-yü eagerly shout\nout: “Request her to walk in at once!”",
        "But should there be any further particulars, which you, reader, might\nfeel disposed to know, peruse the details given in the following\nchapter.",
        "  While Hsi Jen is busy embroidering mandarin ducks, Pao-yü receives, in\n      the Chiang Yün Pavilion, an omen from a dream.\n  Pao-yü apprehends that there is a destiny in affections, when his\n      feelings are aroused to a sense of the situation in the Pear\n      Fragrance court.",
        "Ever since dowager lady Chia’s return from Madame Wang’s quarters, for\nwe will now take up the string of our narrative, she naturally felt\nhappier in her mind as she saw that Pao-yü improved from day to day; but\nnervous lest Chia Cheng should again in the future send for him, she\nlost no time in bidding a servant summon a head-page, a constant\nattendant upon Chia Cheng, to come to her, and in impressing upon him\nvarious orders. “Should,” she enjoined him, “anything turn up\nhenceforward connected with meeting guests, entertaining visitors and\nother such matters, and your master mean to send for Pao-yü, you can\ndispense with going to deliver the message. Just you tell him that I say\nthat after the severe thrashing he has had, great care must be first\ntaken of him during several months before he can be allowed to walk; and\nthat, secondly, his constellation is unpropitious and that he could not\nsee any outsider, while sacrifices are being offered to the stars; that\nI won’t have him therefore put his foot beyond the second gate before\nthe expiry of the eighth moon.”",
        "The head-page listened patiently to her instructions, and, assenting to\nall she had to say, he took his leave.",
        "Old lady Chia thereupon also sent for nurse Li, Hsi Jen and the other\nwaiting-maids and recommended them to tell Pao-yü about her injunctions\nso that he might be able to quiet his mind.",
        "Pao-yü had always had a repugnance for entertaining high officials and\nmen in general, and the greatest horror of going in official hat and\nceremonial dress, to offer congratulations, or express condolences, to\npay calls, return visits, or perform other similar conventionalities,\nbut upon receipt on the present occasion of this message, he became so\nmuch the more confirmed in his dislikes that not only did he suspend all\nintercourse with every single relative and friend, but even went so far\nas to study more than he had ever done before, his own caprices in the\nfulfilment of those morning and evening salutations due to the senior\nmembers of his family. Day after day he spent in the garden, doing\nnothing else than loafing about, sitting down here, or reclining there.\nOf a morning, he would, as soon as it was day, stroll as far as the\nquarters of dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang, to repair back, however,\nin no time. Yet ever ready was he every day that went by to perform\nmenial services for any of the waiting-maids. He, in fact, wasted away\nin the most complete dolce far niente days as well as months. If\nperchance Pao-ch’ai or any other girl of the same age as herself found\nat any time an opportunity to give him advice, he would, instead of\ntaking it in good part, fly into a huff. “A pure and spotless maiden,\"\nhe would say, “has likewise gone and deliberately imitated those\npersons, whose aim is to fish for reputation and to seek praise; that\nset of government thieves and salaried devils. This result entirely\narises from the fact that there have been people in former times, who\nhave uselessly stirred up trouble and purposely fabricated stories with\nthe primary object of enticing the filthy male creatures, who would\nspring up in future ages, to follow in their steps! And who would have\nthought it, I have had the misfortune of being born a masculine being!\nBut, even those beautiful girls, in the female apartments, have been so\ncontaminated by this practice that verily they show themselves\nungrateful for the virtue of Heaven and Earth, in endowing them with\nperception, and in rearing them with so much comeliness.”",
        "Seeing therefore what an insane mania possessed him, not one of his\ncousins came forward to tender him one proper word of counsel. Lin\nTai-yü was the only one of them, who, from his very infancy, had never\nonce admonished him to strive and make a position and attain fame, so\nthus it was that he entertained for Tai-yü profound consideration. But\nenough of minor details.",
        "We will now turn our attention to lady Feng. Soon after the news of Chin\nCh’uan-erh’s death reached her, she saw that domestics from various\nbranches of the family paid her frequent visits at most unexpected\nhours, and presented her a lot of things, and that they courted her\npresence at most unseasonable moments, to pay their compliments and\nadulate her, and she begun to harbour suspicions, in her own mind, as\nshe little knew what their object could possibly be. On this date, she\nagain noticed that some of them had brought their gifts, so, when\nevening arrived, and no one was present, she felt compelled to inquire\njocosely of P’ing Erh what their aim could be.",
        "“Can’t your ladyship fathom even this?” P’ing Erh answered with a\nsardonic smile. “Why, their daughters must, I fancy, be servant-girls in\nMadame Wang’s apartments! For her ladyship’s rooms four elderly girls\nare at present allotted with a monthly allowance of one tael; the rest\nsimply receiving several hundreds of cash each month; so now that Chin\nCh’uan-erh is dead and gone, these people must, of course, be anxious to\ntry their tricks and get this one-tael job!”",
        "Hearing this, lady Feng smiled a significant smile. “That’s it. Yes,\nthat’s it!” she exclaimed. “You’ve really suggested the idea to my mind!\nFrom all appearances, these people are a most insatiable lot; for they\nmake quite enough in the way of money! And as for any business that\nrequires a little exertion, why they are never ready to bear a share of\nit! They make use of their girls as so many tools to shove their own\nduties upon. Yet one overlooks that. But must they too have designs upon\nthis job? Never mind! These people cannot easily afford to spend upon me\nthe money they do. But they bring this upon their own selves, so I’ll\nkeep every bit of thing they send. I’ve, after all, resolved how to act\nin the matter!”",
        "Having arrived at this decision, lady Feng purely and simply protracted\nthe delay until all the women had sent her enough to satisfy her, when\nshe at last suited her own convenience and spoke to Madame Wang (on the\nsubject of the vacant post).",
        "Mrs. Hsüeh and her daughter were sitting one day, at noon, in Madame\nWang’s quarters, together with Lin Tai-yü and the other girls, when lady\nFeng found an opportunity and broached the topic with Madame Wang. “Ever\nsince,” she said, “sister Chin Ch’uan-erh’s death, there has been one\nservant less in your ladyship’s service. But you may possibly have set\nyour choice upon some girl; if so, do let me know who it is, so that I\nmay be able to pay her her monthly wages.”",
        "This reminder made Madame Wang commune with her own self. “I fancy,” she\nremarked; “that the custom is that there should be four or five of them;\nbut as long as there are enough to wait upon me, I don’t mind, so we can\nreally dispense with another.”",
        "“What you say is, properly speaking, perfectly correct,” smiled lady\nFeng; “but it’s an old established custom. There are still a couple to\nbe found in other people’s rooms and won’t you, Madame, conform with the\nrule? Besides, the saving of a tael is a small matter.”",
        "After this argument, Madame Wang indulged in further thought. “Never\nmind,” she then observed, “just you bring over this allowance and pay it\nto me. And there will be no need to supply another girl. I’ll hand over\nthis tael to her younger sister, Yü Ch’uan-erh, and finish with it. Her\nelder sister came to an unpleasant end, after a long term of service\nwith me; so if the younger sister, she leaves behind in my employ,\nreceives a double share, it won’t be any too excessive.”",
        "Lady Feng expressed her approval and turning round she said smilingly to\nYü Ch’uan-erh: “I congratulate you, I congratulate you!”",
        "Yü Ch’uan-erh thereupon crossed over and prostrated herself.",
        "“I just want to ask you,” Madame Wang went on to inquire, “how much Mrs.\nChao and Mrs. Chou are allowed monthly?”",
        "“They have a fixed allowance,” answered lady Feng, “each of them draws\ntwo taels. But Mrs. Chao gets two taels for cousin Chia Huan, so hers\namounts in all to four taels; besides these, four strings of cash.”",
        "“Are they paid in full month after month?” Madame Wang inquired.",
        "Lady Feng thought the question so very strange that she hastened to\nexclaim by way of reply: “How are they not paid in full?”",
        "“The other day,” Madame Wang proceeded, “I heard a faint rumour that\nthere was some one, who complained in an aggrieved way that she had got\na string short. How and why is this?”",
        "“The monthly allowances of the servant-girls, attached to the secondary\nwives,” lady Feng hurriedly added with a smile, “amounted originally to\na tiao each, but ever since last year, it was decided, by those people\noutside, that the shares of each of those ladies’ girls should be\nreduced by half, that is, each to five hundred cash; and, as each lady\nhas a couple of servant-girls, they receive therefore a tiao short. But\nfor this, they can’t bear me a grudge. As far as I’m concerned, I would\nonly be too glad to let them have it; but our people outside will again\ndisallow it; so is it likely that I can authorise any increase, pray? In\nthis matter of payments I merely receive the money, and I’ve nothing to\ndo with how it comes and how it goes. I nevertheless recommended, on two\nor three occasions, that it would be better if these two shares were\nagain raised to the old amount; but they said that there’s only that\nmuch money, so that I can’t very well volunteer any further suggestions!\nNow that the funds are paid into my hands, I give them to them every\nmonth, without any irregularity of even so much as a day. When payments\nhitherto were effected outside, what month were they not short of money?\nAnd did they ever, on any single instance, obtain their pay at the\nproper time and date?”",
        "Having heard this explanation, Madame Wang kept silent for a while.\nNext, she proceeded to ask, how many girls there were with dowager lady\nChia drawing one tael.",
        "“Eight of them,” rejoined lady Feng, “but there are at present only\nseven; the other one is Hsi Jen.”",
        "“Quite right,” assented Madame Wang. “But your cousin Pao-yü hasn’t any\nmaid at one tael; for Hsi Jen is still a servant belonging to old lady\nChia’s household.”",
        "“Hsi Jen,” lady Feng smiled, “is still our dear ancestor’s servant;\nshe’s only lent to cousin Pao-yü; so that she still receives this tael\nin her capacity of maid to our worthy senior. Any proposal, therefore,\nthat might now be made, that this tael should, as Hsi Jen is Pao-yü’s\nservant, be curtailed, can, on no account, be entertained. Yet, were it\nsuggested that another servant should be added to our senior’s staff,\nthen in this way one could reduce the tael she gets. But if this be not\ncurtailed, it will be necessary to also add a servant in cousin Chia\nHuan’s rooms, in order that there should be a fair apportionment. In\nfact, Ch’ing Wen, She Yüeh and the others, numbering seven senior maids,\nreceive each a tiao a month; and Chiao Hui and the rest of the junior\nmaids, eight in all, get each five hundred cash per mensem; and this was\nrecommended by our venerable ancestor herself; so how can any one be\nangry and feel displeasure?”",
        "“Just listen,” laughed Mrs. Hsüeh, “to that girl Feng’s mouth! It\nrattles and rattles like a cart laden with walnuts, which has turned\ntopsy-turvy! Yet, her accounts are, from what one can gather, clear\nenough, and her arguments full of reason.”",
        "“Aunt,” rejoined lady Feng smiling, “was I likely, pray, wrong in what I\nsaid?”",
        "“Who ever said you were wrong?” Mrs. Hsüeh smiled. “But were you to talk\na little slower, wouldn’t it be a saving of exertion for you?”",
        "Lady Feng was about to laugh, but hastily checking herself, she lent an\near to what Madame Wang might have to tell her.",
        "Madame Wang indulged in thought for a considerable time. Afterwards,\nfacing lady Feng, “You’d better,” she said, “select a waiting-maid\ntomorrow and send her over to our worthy senior to fill up Hsi Jen’s\nplace. Then, discontinue that allowance, which Hsi Jen draws, and keep\nout of the sum of twenty taels, allotted to me monthly, two taels and a\ntiao, and give them to Hsi Jen. So henceforward what Mrs. Chao and Mrs.\nChou will get, Hsi Jen will likewise get, with the only difference that\nthe share granted to Hsi Jen, will be entirely apportioned out of my own\nallowance. Mind, therefore, there will be no necessity to touch the\npublic funds!”",
        "Lady Feng acquiesced to each one of her recommendations, and, pushing\nMrs. Hsüeh, “Aunt,” she inquired, “have you heard her proposal? What\nhave I all along maintained? Well, my words have actually come out true\nto-day!”",
        "“This should have been accomplished long ago,” Mrs. Hsüeh answered. “For\nwithout, of course, making any allusion to her looks, her way of doing\nbusiness is liberal; her speech and her relations with people are always\nprompted by an even temper, while inwardly she has plenty of singleness\nof heart and eagerness to hold her own. Indeed, such a girl is not easy\nto come across!”",
        "Madame Wang made every effort to conceal her tears. “How could you\npeople ever rightly estimate Hsi Jen’s qualities?” she observed. “Why,\nshe’s a hundred times better than my own Pao-yü. How fortunate, in\nreality, Pao-yü is! Well would it be if he could have her wait upon him\nfor the whole length of his life!”",
        "“In that case,” lady Feng suggested, “why, have her face shaved at once,\nand openly place her in his room as a secondary wife. Won’t this be a\ngood plan?”",
        "“This won’t do!” Madame Wang retorted. “For first and foremost he’s of\ntender years. In the second place, my husband won’t countenance any such\nthing! In the third, so long as Pao-yü sees that Hsi Jen is his\nwaiting-maid, he may, in the event of anything occurring from his having\nbeen allowed to run wild, listen to any good counsel she might give him.\nBut were she now to be made his secondary wife, Hsi Jen would not\nventure to tender him any extreme advice, even when it’s necessary to do\nso. It’s better, therefore, to let things stand as they are for the\npresent, and talk about them again, after the lapse of another two or\nthree years.”",
        "At the close of these arguments, lady Feng could not put in a word, by\nway of reply, to refute them, so turning round, she left the room. She\nhad no sooner, however, got under the verandah, than she discerned the\nwives of a number of butlers, waiting for her to report various matters\nto her. Seeing her issue out of the room, they with one consent smiled.\n\"What has your ladyship had to lay before Madame Wang,” they remarked,\n\"that you’ve been talking away this length of time? Didn’t you find it\nhot work?”",
        "Lady Feng tucked up her sleeves several times. Then resting her foot on\nthe step of the side door, she laughed and rejoined: “The draft in this\npassage is so cool, that I’ll stop, and let it play on me a bit before I\ngo on. You people,” she proceeded to tell them, “say that I’ve been\ntalking to her all this while, but Madame Wang conjured up all that has\noccurred for the last two hundred years and questioned me about it; so\ncould I very well not have anything to say in reply? But from this day\nforth,” she added with a sarcastic smile, “I shall do several mean\nthings, and should even (Mrs. Chao and Mrs. Chou) go, out of any\nill-will, and tell Madame Wang, I won’t know what fear is for such\nstupid, glib-tongued, foul-mouthed creatures as they, who are bound not\nto see a good end! It isn’t for them to indulge in those fanciful dreams\nof becoming primary wives, for there, will come soon a day when the\nwhole lump sum of their allowance will be cut off! They grumble against\nus for having now reduced the perquisites of the servant-maids, but they\ndon’t consider whether they deserve to have so many as three girls to\ndance attendance on them!”",
        "While heaping abuse on their heads, she started homewards, and went all\nalone in search of some domestic to go and deliver a message to old lady\nChia.",
        "But without any further reference to her, we will take up the thread of\nour narrative with Mrs. Hsüeh, and the others along with her. During\nthis interval they finished feasting on melons. After some more gossip,\neach went her own way; and Pao-ch’ai, Tai-yü and the rest of the cousins\nreturned into the garden. Pao-ch’ai then asked Tai-yü to repair with her\nto the O Hsiang Arbour. But Tai-yü said that she was just going to have\nher bath, so they parted company, and Pao-ch’ai walked back all by\nherself. On her way, she stepped into the I Hung Yüan, to look up Pao-yü\nand have a friendly hobnob with him, with the idea of dispelling her\nmid-day lassitude; but, contrary to her expectations, the moment she put\nher foot into the court, she did not so much as catch the caw of a crow.\nEven the two storks stood under the banana trees, plunged in sleep.\nPao-ch’ai proceeded along the covered passage and entered the rooms.\nHere she discovered the servant-girls sleeping soundly on the bed of the\nouter apartment; some lying one way, some another; so turning round the\ndecorated screen, she wended her steps into Pao-yü’s chamber. Pao-yü was\nasleep in bed. Hsi Jen was seated by his side, busy plying her needle.\nNext to her, lay a yak tail. Pao-ch’ai advanced up to her. “You’re\nreally far too scrupulous,” she said smilingly in an undertone. “Are\nthere still flies or mosquitos in here? and why do yet use that fly-flap\nfor, to drive what away?”",
        "Hsi Jen was quite taken by surprise. But hastily raising her head, and\nrealising that it was Pao-ch’ai, she hurriedly put down her needlework.\n\"Miss,” she whispered with a smile, “you came upon me so unawares that\nyou gave me quite a start! You don’t know, Miss, that though there be no\nflies or mosquitoes there is, no one would believe it, a kind of small\ninsect, which penetrates through the holes of this gauze; it is scarcely\nto be detected, but when one is asleep, it bites just like ants do!”",
        "“It isn’t to be wondered at,” Pao-ch’ai suggested, “for the back of\nthese rooms adjoins the water; the whole place is also one mass of\nfragrant flowers, and the interior of this room is, too, full of their\naroma. These insects grow mostly in the core of flowers, so no sooner do\nthey scent the smell of any than they at once rush in.”",
        "Saying this, she cast a look on the needlework she (Hsi Jen) held in her\nhands. It consisted, in fact, of a belt of white silk, lined with red,\nand embroidered on the upper part with designs representing mandarin\nducks, disporting themselves among some lotus. The lotus flowers were\nred, the leaves green, the ducks of variegated colours.",
        "“Ai-yah!” ejaculated Pao-ch’ai, “what very beautiful work! For whom is\nthis, that it’s worth your while wasting so much labour on it?”",
        "Hsi Jen pouted her lips towards the bed.",
        "“Does a big strapping fellow like this,” Pao-ch’ai laughed, “still wear\nsuch things?”",
        "“He would never wear any before,” Hsi Jen smiled, “that’s why such a\nnice one was specially worked for him, in order that when he was allowed\nto see it, he should not be able to do otherwise than use it. With the\npresent hot weather, he goes to sleep anyhow, but as he has been coaxed\nto wear it, it doesn’t matter if even he doesn’t cover himself well at\nnight. You say that I bestow much labour upon this, but you haven’t yet\nseen the one he has on!”",
        "“It is a lucky thing,” Pao-ch’ai observed, smiling, “that you’re gifted\nwith such patience.”",
        "“I’ve done so much of it to-day,” remarked Hsi Jen, “that my neck is\nquite sore from bending over it. My dear Miss,” she then urged with a\nbeaming countenance, “do sit here a little. I’ll go out for a turn. I’ll\nbe back shortly.”",
        "With these words, she sallied out of the room.",
        "Pao-ch’ai was intent upon examining the embroidery, so in her\nabsentmindedness, she, with one bend of her body, settled herself on the\nvery same spot, which Hsi Jen had recently occupied. But she found, on\nsecond scrutiny, the work so really admirable, that impulsively picking\nup the needle, she continued it for her. At quite an unforeseen\nmoment–for Lin Tai-yü had met Shih Hsiang-yün and asked her to come\nalong with her and present her congratulations to Hsi Jen–these two\ngirls made their appearance in the court. Finding the whole place\nplunged in silence, Hsiang-yün turned round and betook herself first\ninto the side-rooms in search of Hsi Jen. Lin Tai-yü, meanwhile, walked\nup to the window from outside, and peeped in through the gauze frame. At\na glance, she espied Pao-yü, clad in a silvery-red coat, lying\ncarelessly on the bed, and Pao-ch’ai, seated by his side, busy at some\nneedlework, with a fly-brush resting by her side.",
        "As soon as Lin Tai-yü became conscious of the situation, she immediately\nslipped out of sight, and stopping her mouth with one hand, as she did\nnot venture to laugh aloud, she waved her other hand and beckoned to\nHsiang-yün. The moment Hsiang-yün saw the way she went on, she concluded\nthat she must have something new to impart to her, and she approached\nher with all promptitude. At the sight, which opened itself before her\neyes, she also felt inclined to laugh. Yet the sudden recollection of\nthe kindness, with which Pao-ch’ai had always dealt towards her, induced\nher to quickly seal her lips. And knowing well enough that Tai-yü never\nspared any one with her mouth, she was seized with such fear lest she\nshould jeer at them, that she immediately dragged her past the window.\n\"Come along!” she observed. “Hsi Jen, I remember, said that she would be\ngoing at noon to wash some clothes at the pond. I presume she’s there\nalready so let’s go and join her.”",
        "Tai-yü inwardly grasped her meaning, but, after indulging in a couple of\nsardonic smiles, she had no alternative but to follow in her footsteps.",
        "Pao-ch’ai had, during this while, managed to embroider two or three\npetals, when she heard Pao-yü begin to shout abusingly in his dreams.\n\"How can,” he cried, “one ever believe what bonzes and Taoist priests\nsay? What about a match between gold and jade? My impression is that\nit’s to be a union between a shrub and a stone!”",
        "Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai caught every single word uttered by him and fell\nunconsciously in a state of excitement. Of a sudden, however, Hsi Jen\nappeared on the scene. “Hasn’t he yet woke up?” she inquired.",
        "Pao-ch’ai nodded her head by way of reply.",
        "“I just came across,” Hsi Jen smiled, “Miss Lin and Miss Shih. Did they\nhappen to come in?”",
        "“I didn’t see them come in,” Pao-ch’ai answered. “Did they tell you\nanything?” she next smilingly asked of Hsi Jen.",
        "Hsi Jen blushed and laughed significantly. “They simply came out with\nsome of those jokes of theirs,” she explained. “What decent things could\nsuch as they have had to tell me?”",
        "“They made insinuations to-day,” Pao-ch’ai laughed, “which are anything\nbut a joke! I was on the point of telling you them, when you rushed away\nin an awful hurry.”",
        "But no sooner had she concluded, than she perceived a servant, come over\nfrom lady Feng’s part to fetch Hsi Jen. “It must be on account of what\nthey hinted,” Pao-ch’ai smilingly added.",
        "Hsi Jen could not therefore do otherwise than arouse two servant-maids\nand go. She proceeded, with Pao-ch’ai, out of the I Hung court, and then\nrepaired all alone to lady Feng’s on this side. It was indeed to\ncommunicate to her what had been decided about her, and to explain to\nher, as well, that though she could go and prostrate herself before\nMadame Wang, she could dispense with seeing dowager lady Chia. This news\nmade Hsi Jen feel very awkward; to such an extent, that no sooner had\nshe got through her visit to Madame Wang, than she returned in a hurry\nto her rooms.",
        "Pao-yü had already awoke. He asked the reason why she had been called\naway, but Hsi Jen temporised by giving him an evasive answer. And only\nat night, when every one was quiet, did Hsi Jen at length give him a\nfull account of the whole matter. Pao-yü was delighted beyond measure.\n\"I’ll see now,” he said, with a face beaming with smiles, “whether\nyou’ll go back home or not. On your return, after your last visit to\nyour people, you stated that your brother wished to redeem you, adding\nthat this place was no home for you, and that you didn’t know what would\nbecome of you in the long run. You freely uttered all that language\ndevoid of feeling and reason, and enough too to produce an estrangement\nbetween us, in order to frighten me; but I’d like to see who’ll\nhenceforward have the audacity to come and ask you to leave!”",
        "Hsi Jen, upon hearing this, smiled a smile full of irony. “You shouldn’t\nsay such things!” she replied. “From henceforward I shall be our Madame\nWang’s servant, so that, if I choose to go I needn’t even breathe a word\nto you. All I’ll have to do will be to tell her, and then I shall be\nfree to do as I like.”",
        "“But supposing that I behaved improperly,” demurred Pao-yü laughingly,\n\"and that you took your leave after letting mother know, you yourself\nwill be placed in no nice fix, when people get wind that you left on\naccount of my having been improper.”",
        "“What no nice fix!” smiled Hsi Jen. “Is it likely that I am bound to\nserve even highway robbers? Well, failing anything else, I can die; for\nhuman beings may live a hundred years, but they’re bound, in the long\nrun, to fall a victim to death! And when this breath shall have\ndeparted, and I shall have lost the sense of hearing and of seeing, all\nwill then be well!”",
        "When her rejoinder fell on his ear, Pao-yü promptly stopped her mouth\nwith both his hands. “Enough! enough! that will do,” he shouted.\n\"There’s no necessity for you to utter language of this kind.”",
        "Hsi Jen was well aware that Pao-yü was gifted with such a peculiar\ntemperament, that he even looked upon flattering or auspicious phrases\nwith utter aversion, treating them as meaningless and consequently\ninsincere, so when, after listening to those truths, she had spoken with\nsuch pathos, he, lapsed into another of his melancholy moods, she blamed\nherself for the want of consideration she had betrayed. Hastily\ntherefore putting on a smile, she tried to hit upon some suitable\nremarks, with which to interrupt the conversation. Her choice fell upon\nthose licentious and immodest topics, which had ever been a relish to\nthe taste of Pao-yü; and from these the conversation drifted to the\nsubject of womankind. But when, subsequently, reference was made to the\nexcellency of the weak sex, they somehow or other also came to touch\nupon the mortal nature of women, and Hsi Jen promptly closed her lips in\nsilence.",
        "Noticing however that now that the conversation had reached a point so\nfull of zest for him, she had nothing to say for herself, Pao-yü\nsmilingly remarked: “What human being is there that can escape death?\nBut the main thing is to come to a proper end! All that those abject\nmale creatures excel in is, the civil officers, to sacrifice their lives\nby remonstrating with the Emperor; and, the military, to leave their\nbones on the battlefield. Both these deaths do confer, after life is\nextinct, the fame of great men upon them; but isn’t it, in fact, better\nfor them not to die? For as it is absolutely necessary that there should\nbe a disorderly Emperor before they can afford any admonition, to what\nfuture fate do they thus expose their sovereign, if they rashly throw\naway their lives, with the sole aim of reaping a fair name for\nthemselves? War too must supervene before they can fight; but if they go\nand recklessly lay down their lives, with the exclusive idea of gaining\nthe reputation of intrepid warriors, to what destiny will they abandon\ntheir country by and bye? Hence it is that neither of these deaths can\nbe looked upon as a legitimate death.”",
        "“Loyal ministers,” Hsi Jen argued, “and excellent generals simply die\nbecause it isn’t in their power to do otherwise.”",
        "“Military officers,” Pao-yü explained, “place such entire reliance upon\nbrute force that they become lax in their stratagems and faulty in their\nplans. It’s because they don’t possess any inherent abilities that they\nlose their lives. Could one therefore, pray, say that they had no other\nalternative? Civil officials, on the other hand, can still less compare\nwith military officers. They read a few passages from books, and commit\nthem to memory; and, on the slightest mistake made by the Emperor,\nthey’re at once rash enough to remonstrate with him, prompted by the\nsole idea of attaining the fame of loyalty and devotion. But, as soon as\ntheir stupid notions have bubbled over, they forfeit their lives, and is\nit likely that it doesn’t lie within their power to do otherwise? Why,\nthey should also bear in mind that the Emperor receives his decrees from\nHeaven; and, that were he not a perfect man, Heaven itself would, on no\naccount whatever, confer upon him a charge so extremely onerous. This\nmakes it evident therefore that the whole pack and parcel of those\nofficers, who are dead and gone, have invariably fallen victims to their\nendeavours to attain a high reputation, and that they had no knowledge\nwhatever of the import of the great principle of right! Take me as an\ninstance now. Were really mine the good fortune of departing life at a\nfit time, I’d avail myself of the present when all you girls are alive,\nto pass away. And could I get you to shed such profuse tears for me as\nto swell out into a stream large enough to raise my corpse and carry it\nto some secluded place, whither no bird even has ever wended its flight,\nand could I become invisible like the wind, and nevermore from this\ntime, come into existence as a human being, I shall then have died at a\nproper season.”",
        "Hsi Jen suddenly awoke to the fact that he was beginning to give vent to\na lot of twaddle, and speedily, pleading fatigue, she paid no further\nnotice to him. This compelled Pao-yü to at last be quiet and go to\nsleep. By the morrow, all recollection of the discussion had vanished\nfrom his mind.",
        "One day, Pao-yü was feeling weary at heart, after strolling all over the\nplace, when remembering the song of the “Peony Pavilion,” he read it\nover twice to himself; but still his spirits continued anything but\njoyous. Having heard, however, that among the twelve girls in the Pear\nFragrance Court there was one called Ling Kuan, who excelled in singing,\nhe purposely issued forth by a side gate and came in search of her. But\nthe moment he got there, he discovered Pao Kuan, and Yü Kuan in the\ncourt. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yü, they, with one consent,\nsmiled and urged him to take a seat. Pao-yü then inquired where Ling\nKuan was. Both girls explained that she was in her room, so Pao-yü\nhastened in. Here he found Ling Kuan alone, reclining against a pillow.\nThough perfectly conscious of his arrival, she did not move a muscle.\nPao-yü ensconced himself next to her. He had always been in the habit of\nplaying with the rest of the girls, so thinking that Ling Kuan was like\nthe others, he felt impelled to draw near her and to entreat her, with a\nforced smile, to get up and sing part of the “Niao Ch’ing Ssu.” But his\nhopes were baffled; for as soon as Ling Kuan perceived him sit down, she\nimpetuously raised herself and withdrew from his side. “I’m hoarse,” she\nrejoined with a stern expression on her face. “The Empress the other day\ncalled us into the palace; but I couldn’t sing even then.”",
        "Seeing her sit bolt upright, Pao-yü went on to pass her under a minute\nsurvey. He discovered that it was the girl, whom he had, some time ago\nbeheld under the cinnamon roses, drawing the character “Ch’iang.” But\nseeing the reception she accorded him, who had never so far known what\nit was to be treated contemptuously by any one, he blushed crimson,\nwhile muttering some abuse to himself, and felt constrained to quit the\nroom.",
        "Pao Kuan and her companion could not fathom why he was so red and\ninquired of him the reason. Pao-yü told them. “Wait a while,” Pao Kuan\nsaid, “until Mr. Ch’iang Secundus comes; and when he asks her to sing,\nshe is bound to sing.”",
        "Pao-yü at these words felt very sad within himself. “Where’s brother\nCh’iang gone to?” he asked.",
        "“He’s just gone out,” Pao Kuan answered. “Of course, Ling Kuan must have\nwanted something or other, and he’s gone to devise ways and means to\nbring it to her.”",
        "Pao-yü thought this remark very extraordinary. But after standing about\nfor a while, he actually saw Chia Ch’iang arrive from outside, carrying\na cage, with a tiny stage inserted at the top, and a bird as well; and\nwend his steps, in a gleeful mood, towards the interior to join Ling\nKuan. The moment, however, he noticed Pao-yü, he felt under the\nnecessity of halting.",
        "“What kind of bird is that?” Pao-yü asked. “Can it hold a flag in its\nbeak, or do any tricks?”",
        "“It’s the ’jade-crested and gold-headed bird,’” smiled Chia Ch’iang.",
        "“How much did you give for it?” Pao-yü continued.",
        "“A tael and eight mace,” replied Chia Ch’iang.",
        "But while replying to his inquiries, he motioned to Pao-yü to take a\nseat, and then went himself into Ling Kuan’s apartment.",
        "Pao-yü had, by this time, lost every wish of hearing a song. His sole\ndesire was to find what relations existed between his cousin and Ling\nKuan, when he perceived Chia Ch’iang walk in and laughingly say to her,\n\"Come and see this thing.”",
        "“What’s it?” Ling Kuan asked, rising.",
        "“I’ve bought a bird for you to amuse yourself with,” Chia Ch’iang added,\n\"so that you mayn’t daily feel dull and have nothing to distract\nyourself with. But I’ll first play with it and let you see.”",
        "With this prelude, he took a few seeds and began to coax the bird, until\nit, in point of fact, performed various tricks, on the stage, clasping\nin its beak a mask and a flag.",
        "All the girls shouted out: “How nice;” with the sole exception of Ling\nKuan, who gave a couple of apathetic smirks, and went in a huff to lie\ndown. Again Chia Ch’iang, however, kept on forcing smiles, and inquiring\nof her whether she liked it or not.",
        "“Isn’t it enough,” Ling Kuan observed, “that your family entraps a fine\nlot of human beings like us and coops us up in this hole to study this\nstuff and nonsense, but do you also now go and get a bird, which\nlikewise is, as it happens, up to this sort of thing? You distinctly\nfetch it to make fun of us, and mimick us, and do you still ask me\nwhether I like it or not?”",
        "Hearing this reproach, Chia Ch’iang of a sudden sprang to his feet with\nalacrity and vehemently endeavoured by vowing and swearing to establish\nhis innocence. “How ever could I have been such a fool to-day,” he\nproceeded, “as to go and throw away a tael or two to purchase this bird?\nI really did it in the hope that it would afford you amusement. I never\nfor a moment entertained such thoughts as those you credit me with. But\nnever mind; I’ll let it go, and save you all this misery!”",
        "So saying, he verily gave the bird its liberty; and, with one blow, he\nsmashed the cage to atoms.",
        "“This bird,” still argued Ling Kuan, “differs, it’s true, from a human\nbeing; but it too has a mother and father in its nest, and could you\nhave had the heart to bring it here to perform these silly pranks? In\ncoughing to-day, I expectorated two mouthfuls of blood, and Madame Wang\nsent some one here to find you so as to tell you to ask the doctor round\nto minutely diagnose my complaint, and have you instead brought this to\nmock me with? But it so happens that I, who have not a soul to look\nafter me, or to care for me, also have the fate to fall ill!”",
        "Chia Ch’iang listened to her. “Yesterday evening,” he eagerly explained,\n\"I asked the doctor about it. He said that it was nothing at all, that\nyou should take a few doses of medicine, and that he would be coming\nagain in a day or two to see how you were getting on. But who’d have\nthought it, you have again to-day expectorated blood. I’ll go at once\nand invite him to come round.”",
        "Speaking the while, he was about to go immediately when Ling Kuan cried\nout and stopped him. “Do you go off in a tantrum in this hot broiling\nsun?” she said. “You may ask him to come, but I won’t see him.”",
        "When he heard her resolution, Chia Ch’iang had perforce to stand still.",
        "Pao-yü, perceiving what transpired between them, fell unwittingly in a\ndull reverie. He then at length got an insight into the deep import of\nthe tracing of the character “Ch’iang.” But unable to bear the ordeal\nany longer, he forthwith took himself out of the way. So absorbed,\nhowever, was Chia Ch’iang’s whole mind with Ling Kuan that he could not\neven give a thought to escorting any one; and it was, in fact, the rest\nof the singing-girls who saw (Pao-yü) out.",
        "Pao-yü’s heart was gnawed with doubts and conjectures. In an imbecile\nframe of mind, he came to the I Hung court. Lin Tai-yü was, at the\nmoment, sitting with Hsi Jen, and chatting with her. As soon as Pao-yü\nentered his quarters, he addressed himself to Hsi Jen, with a long sigh.\n\"I was very wrong in what I said yesterday evening,” he remarked. “It’s\nno matter of surprise that father says that I am so narrow-minded that I\nlook at things through a tube and measure them with a clam-shell. I\nmentioned something last night about having nothing but tears, shed by\nall of you girls, to be buried in. But this was a mere delusion! So as I\ncan’t get the tears of the whole lot of you, each one of you can\nhenceforward keep her own for herself, and have done.”",
        "Hsi Jen had flattered herself that the words he had uttered the previous\nevening amounted to idle talk, and she had long ago dispelled all\nthought of them from her mind, but when Pao-yü unawares made further\nallusion to them, she smilingly rejoined: “You are verily somewhat\ncracked!”",
        "Pao-yü kept silent, and attempted to make no reply. Yet from this time\nhe fully apprehended that the lot of human affections is, in every\ninstance, subject to predestination, and time and again he was wont to\nsecretly muse, with much anguish: “Who, I wonder, will shed tears for\nme, at my burial?”",
        "Lin Tai-yü, for we will now allude to her, noticed Pao-yü’s behaviour,\nbut readily concluding that he must have been, somewhere or other, once\nmore possessed by some malignant spirit, she did not feel it advisable\nto ask many questions. “I just saw,” she consequently observed, “my\nmaternal aunt, who hearing that to-morrow is Miss Hsüeh’s birthday, bade\nme come at my convenience to ask you whether you’ll go or not, (and to\ntell you) to send some one ahead to let them know what you mean to do.”",
        "“I didn’t go the other day, when it was Mr. Chia She’s birthday, so I\nwon’t go now.” Pao-yü answered. “If it is a matter of meeting any one, I\nwon’t go anywhere. On a hot day like this to again don my ceremonial\ndress! No, I won’t go. Aunt is not likely to feel displeased with me!”",
        "“What are you driving at?” Hsi Jen speedily ventured. “She couldn’t be\nput on the same footing as our senior master! She lives close by here.\nBesides she’s a relative. Why, if you don’t go, won’t you make her\nimagine things? Well, if you dread the heat, just get up at an early\nhour and go over and prostrate yourself before her, and come back again,\nafter you’ve had a cup of tea. Won’t this look well?”",
        "Before Pao-yü had time to say anything by way of response, Tai-yü\nanticipated him. “You should,” she smiled, “go as far as there for the\nsake of her, who drives the mosquitoes away from you.”",
        "Pao-yü could not make out the drift of her insinuation. “What about\ndriving mosquitoes away?” he vehemently inquired.",
        "Hsi Jen then explained to him how while he was fast asleep the previous\nday and no one was about to keep him company, Miss Pao-ch’ai had sat\nwith him for a while.",
        "“It shouldn’t have been done!” Pao-yü promptly exclaimed, after hearing\nher explanations. “But how did I manage to go to sleep and show such\nutter discourtesy to her? I must go to-morrow!” he then went on to add.\nBut while these words were still on his lips, he unexpectedly caught\nsight of Shih Hsian-yün walk in in full dress, to bid them adieu, as she\nsaid that some one had been sent from her home to fetch her away.",
        "The moment Pao-yü and Tai-yü heard what was the object of her visit,\nthey quickly rose to their feet and pressed her to take a seat. But Shih\nHsiang-yün would not sit down, so Pao-yü and Tai-yü were compelled to\nescort her as far as the front part of the mansion.",
        "Shih Hsiang-yün’s eyes were brimming with tears; but realising that\nseveral people from her home were present, she did not have the courage\nto give full vent to her feelings. But when shortly Pao-ch’ai ran over\nto find her, she felt so much the more drawn towards them, that she\ncould not brook to part from them. Pao-ch’ai, however, inwardly\nunderstood that if her people told her aunt anything on their return,\nthere would again be every fear of her being blown up, as soon as she\ngot back home, and she therefore urged her to start on her way. One and\nall then walked with her up to the second gate, and Pao-yü wished to\naccompany her still further outside, but Shih Hsiang-yün deterred him.\nPresently, they turned to go back. But once more, she called Pao-yü to\nher, and whispered to him in a soft tone of voice: “Should our venerable\nsenior not think of me do often allude to me, so that she should depute\nsome one to fetch me.”",
        "Pao-yü time after time assured her that he would comply with her wishes.\nAnd having followed her with their eyes, while she got into her curricle\nand started, they eventually retraced their steps towards the inner\ncompound. But, reader, if you like to follow up the story, peruse the\ndetails contained in the chapter below.",
        "  In the Study of Autumnal Cheerfulness is accidentally formed the\n      Cydonia Japonica Society.\n  In the Heng Wu Court, the chrysanthemum is, on a certain night,\n      proposed as a subject for verses.",
        "But to continue. After Shih Hsiang-yün’s return home, Pao-yü and the\nother inmates spent their time, as of old, in rambling about in the\ngarden in search of pleasure, and in humming poetical compositions. But\nwithout further reference to their doings, let us take up our narrative\nwith Chia Cheng.",
        "Ever since the visit paid to her home by the imperial consort, he\nfulfilled his official duties with additional zeal, for the purpose of\nreverently making requital for the grace shown him by the Emperor. His\ncorrect bearing and his spotless reputation did not escape His Majesty’s\nnotice, and he conferred upon him the special appointment of Literary\nChancellor, with the sole object of singling out his true merit; for\nthough he had not commenced his career through the arena of public\nexaminations, he belonged nevertheless to a family addicted to letters\nduring successive generations. Chia Cheng had, therefore, on the receipt\nof the imperial decree, to select the twentieth day of the eighth moon\nto set out on his journey. When the appointed day came, he worshipped at\nthe shrines of his ancestors, took leave of them and of dowager lady\nChia, and started for his post. It would be a needless task, however, to\nrecount with any full particulars how Pao-yü and all the inmates saw him\noff, how Chia Cheng went to take up his official duties, and what\noccurred abroad, suffice it for us to notice that Pao-yü, ever since\nChia Cheng’s departure, indulged his caprices, allowed his feelings to\nrun riot, and gadded wildly about. In fact, he wasted his time, and\nadded fruitless days and months to his age.",
        "On this special occasion, he experienced more than ever a sense of his\nlack of resources, and came to look up his grandmother Chia and Madame\nWang. With them, he whiled away some of his time, after which he\nreturned into the garden. As soon as he changed his costume, he\nperceived Ts’ui Mo enter, with a couple of sheets of fancy notepaper, in\nher hand, which she delivered to him.",
        "“It quite slipped from my mind,” Pao-yü remarked. “I meant to have gone\nand seen my cousin Tertia; is she better that you come?”",
        "“Miss is all right,” Ts’ui Mo answered. “She hasn’t even had any\nmedicine to-day. It’s only a slight chill.”",
        "When Pao-yü heard this reply, he unfolded the fancy notepaper. On\nperusal, he found the contents to be: “Your cousin, T’an Ch’un,\nrespectfully lays this on her cousin Secundus’ study-table. When the\nother night the blue sky newly opened out to view, the moon shone as if\nit had been washed clean! Such admiration did this pure and rare\npanorama evoke in me that I could not reconcile myself to the idea of\ngoing to bed. The clepsydra had already accomplished three turns, and\nyet I roamed by the railing under the dryandra trees. But such poor\ntreatment did I receive from wind and dew (that I caught a chill), which\nbrought about an ailment as severe (as that which prevented the man of\nold from) picking up sticks. You took the trouble yesterday to come in\nperson and cheer me up. Time after time also did you send your\nattendants round to make affectionate inquiries about me. You likewise\npresented me with fresh lichees and relics of writings of Chen Ch’ing.\nHow deep is really your gracious love! As I leant to-day on my table\nplunged in silence, I suddenly remembered that the ancients of\nsuccessive ages were placed in circumstances, in which they had to\nstruggle for reputation and to fight for gain, but that they\nnevertheless acquired spots with hills and dripping streams, and,\ninviting people to come from far and near, they did all they could to\ndetain them, by throwing the linch-pins of their chariots into wells or\nby holding on to their shafts; and that they invariably joined\nfriendship with two or three of the same mind as themselves, with whom\nthey strolled about in these grounds, either erecting altars for song,\nor establishing societies for scanning poetical works. Their meetings\nwere, it is true, prompted, on the spur of the moment, by a sudden fit\nof good cheer, but these have again and again proved, during many years,\na pleasant topic of conversation. I, your cousin, may, I admit, be\ndevoid of talent, yet I have been fortunate enough to enjoy your company\namidst streams and rockeries, and to furthermore admire the elegant\nverses composed by Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai and Lin Tai-yü. When we were in the\nbreezy hall and the moonlit pavilion, what a pity we never talked about\npoets! But near the almond tree with the sign and the peach tree by the\nstream, we may perhaps, when under the fumes of wine, be able to fling\nround the cups, used for humming verses! Who is it who opines that\nsocieties with any claim to excellent abilities can only be formed by\nmen? May it not be that the pleasant meetings on the Tung Shan might\nyield in merit to those, such as ourselves, of the weaker sex? Should\nyou not think it too much to walk on the snow, I shall make bold to ask\nyou round, and sweep the way clean of flowers and wait for you.\nRespectfully written.”",
        "The perusal of this note filled Pao-yü unawares with exultation.\nClapping his hands; “My third cousin,” he laughed, “is the one eminently\npolished; I’ll go at once to-day and talk matters over with her.”",
        "As he spoke, he started immediately, followed by Ts’ui Mo. As soon as\nthey reached the Hsin Fang pavilion, they espied the matron, on duty\nthat day at the back door of the garden, advancing towards them with a\nnote in her hand. The moment she perceived Pao-yü she forthwith came up\nto meet him. “Mr. Yün,” she said, “presents his compliments to you. He\nis waiting for you at the back gate. This is a note he bade me bring\nyou.”",
        "Upon opening the note, Pao-yü found it to read as follows: “An unfilial\nson, Yün, reverently inquires about his worthy father’s boundless\nhappiness and precious health. Remembering the honour conferred upon me\nby your recognising me, in your heavenly bounty, as your son, I tried\nboth day as well as night to do something in evidence of my pious\nobedience, but no opportunity could I find to perform anything filial.\nWhen I had, some time back, to purchase flowers and plants, I succeeded,\nthanks to your vast influence, venerable senior, in finally making\nfriends with several gardeners and in seeing a good number of gardens.\nAs the other day I unexpectedly came across a white begonia, of a rare\nspecies, I exhausted every possible means to get some and managed to\nobtain just two pots. If you, worthy senior, regard your son as your own\nvery son, do keep them to feast your eyes upon! But with this hot\nweather to-day, the young ladies in the garden will, I fear, not be at\ntheir ease. I do not consequently presume to come and see you in person,\nso I present you this letter, written with due respect, while knocking\nmy head before your table. Your son, Yün, on his knees, lays this\nepistle at your feet. A joke!”",
        "After reading this note, Pao-yü laughed. “Has he come alone?” he asked.\n\"Or has he any one else with him?”",
        "“He’s got two flower pots as well,” rejoined the matron.",
        "“You go and tell him,” Pao-yü urged, “that I’ve informed myself of the\ncontents of his note, and that there are few who think of me as he does!\nIf you also take the flowers and, put them in my room, it will be all\nright.”",
        "So saying, he came with Ts’ui Mo into the Ch’iu Shuang study, where he\ndiscovered Pao-ch’ai, Tai-yü, Ying Ch’un and Hsi Ch’un already\nassembled. When they saw him drop in upon them, they all burst out\nlaughing. “Here comes still another!” they exclaimed.",
        "“I’m not a boor,” smiled T’an Ch’un, “so when the idea casually crossed\nmy mind, I wrote a few notes to try and see who would come. But who’d\nhave thought that, as soon as I asked you, you would all come.”",
        "“It’s unfortunately late,” Pao-yü smilingly observed. “We should have\nstarted this society long ago.”",
        "“You can’t call this late!” Tai-yü interposed, “so why give way to\nregret! The only thing is, you must form your society, without including\nme in the number; for I daren’t be one of you.”",
        "“If you daren’t,” Ying Ch’un smiled, “who can presume to do so?”",
        "“This is,” suggested Pao-yü, “a legitimate and great purpose; and we\nshould all exert our energies. You shouldn’t be modest, and I yielding;\nbut every one of us, who thinks of anything, should freely express it\nfor general discussion. So senior cousin Pao-ch’ai do make some\nsuggestion; and you junior cousin Lin Tai-yü say something.”",
        "“What are you in this hurry for?” Pao-ch’ai exclaimed. “We are not all\nhere yet.”",
        "This remark was barely concluded, when Li Wan also arrived. As soon as\nshe crossed the threshold, “It’s an excellent proposal,” she laughingly\ncried, “this of starting a poetical society. I recommend myself as\ncontroller. Some time ago in spring, I thought of this, ’but,’ I mused,\n’I am unable to compose verses, so what’s the use of making a mess of\nthings?’ This is why I dispelled the idea from my mind, and made no\nmention about it. But since it’s your good pleasure, cousin Tertia, to\nstart it, I’ll help you to set it on foot.”",
        "“As you’ve made up your minds,” Tai-yü put in, “to initiate a poetical\nsociety, every one of us will be poets, so we should, as a first step,\ndo away with those various appellations of cousin and uncle and aunt,\nand thus avoid everything that bears a semblance of vulgarity.”",
        "“First rate,” exclaimed Li Wan, “and why should we not fix upon some new\ndesignations by which to address ourselves? This will be a far more\nrefined way! As for my own, I’ve selected that of the ’Old farmer of Tao\nHsiang;’ so let none of you encroach on it.”",
        "“I’ll then call myself the ’resident-scholar of the Ch’iu Shuang,’ and\nhave done,” T’an Ch’un observed with a smile.",
        "“’Resident-scholar or master’ is, in fact, not to the point. It’s\nclumsy, besides,” Pao-yü interposed. “The place here is full of dryandra\nand banana trees, and if one could possibly hit upon some name bearing\nupon the dryandra and banana, it would be preferable.”",
        "“I’ve got one,” shouted T’an Ch’un smilingly. “I’ll style myself ’the\nguest under the banana trees.’”",
        "“How uncommon!” they unanimously cried. “It’s a nice one!”",
        "“You had better,” laughed Tai-yü, “be quick and drag her away and stew\nsome slices of her flesh, for people to eat with their wine.”",
        "No one grasped her meaning, “Ch’uang-tzu,” Tai-yü proceeded to explain,\nsmiling, “says: ’The banana leaves shelter the deer,’ and as she styles\nherself the guest under the banana tree, is she not a deer? So be quick\nand make pieces of dried venison of her.”",
        "At these words, the whole company laughed.",
        "“Don’t be in a hurry!” T’an Ch’un remarked, as she laughed. “You make\nuse of specious language to abuse people; but I’ve thought of a fine and\nmost apposite name for you!” Whereupon addressing herself to the party,\n\"In days gone by,” she added, “an imperial concubine, Nü Ying, sprinkled\nher tears on the bamboo, and they became spots, so from olden times to\nthe present spotted bamboos have been known as the ’Hsiang imperial\nconcubine bamboo.’ Now she lives in the Hsiao Hsiang lodge, and has a\nweakness too for tears, so the bamboos over there will by and bye, I\npresume, likewise become transformed into speckled bamboos; every one\ntherefore must henceforward call her the ’Hsiao Hsiang imperial\nconcubine’ and finish with it.”",
        "After listening to her, they one and all clapped their hands, and cried\nout: “Capital!” Lin Tai-yü however drooped her head and did not so much\nas utter a single word.",
        "“I’ve also,” Li Wan smiled, “devised a suitable name for senior cousin,\nHsüeh Pao-chai. It too is one of three characters.”",
        "“What’s it?” eagerly inquired the party.",
        "“I’ll raise her to the rank of ’Princess of Heng Wu,’” Li Wan rejoined.\n\"I wonder what you all think about this.”",
        "“This title of honour,” T’an Ch’un observed, “is most apposite.”",
        "“What about mine?” Pao-yü asked. “You should try and think of one for me\nalso!”",
        "“Your style has long ago been decided upon,” Pao-ch’ai smiled. “It\nconsists of three words: ’fussing for nothing!’ It’s most pat!”",
        "“You should, after all, retain your old name of ’master of the flowers\nin the purple cave,’” Li Wan suggested. “That will do very well.”",
        "“Those were some of the doings of my youth; why rake them up again?\"\nPao-yü laughed.",
        "“Your styles are very many,” T’an Ch’un observed, “and what do you want\nto choose another for? All you’ve got to do is to make suitable reply\nwhen we call you whatever takes our fancy.”",
        "“I must however give you a name,” Pao-ch’ai remarked. “There’s a very\nvulgar name, but it’s just the very thing for you. What is difficult to\nobtain in the world are riches and honours; what is not easy to combine\nwith them is leisure. These two blessings cannot be enjoyed together,\nbut, as it happens, you hold one along with the other, so that we might\nas well dub you the ’rich and honourable idler.’”",
        "“It won’t do; it isn’t suitable,” Pao-yü laughed. “It’s better that you\nshould call me, at random, whatever you like.”",
        "“What names are to be chosen for Miss Secunda and Miss Quarta?” Li Wan\ninquired.",
        "“We also don’t excel in versifying; what’s the use consequently of\ngiving us names, all for no avail?” Ying Ch’un said.",
        "“In spite of this,” argued T’an Ch’un, “it would be well to likewise\nfind something for you!”",
        "“She lives in the Tzu Ling Chou, (purple caltrop Isle), so let us call\nher ’Ling Chou,’” Pao-ch’ai suggested. “As for that girl Quarta, she\nlives in the On Hsiang Hsieh, (lotus fragrance pavilion); she should\nthus be called On Hsieh and have done!”",
        "“These will do very well!” Li Wan cried. “But as far as age goes, I am\nthe senior, and you should all defer to my wishes; but I feel certain\nthat when I’ve told you what they are, you will unanimously agree to\nthem. We are seven here to form the society, but neither I, nor Miss\nSecunda, nor Miss Quarta can write verses; so if you will exclude us\nthree, we’ll each share some special duties.”",
        "“Their names have already been chosen,” T’an Ch’un smilingly demurred;\n\"and do you still keep on addressing them like this? Well, in that case,\nwon’t it be as well for them to have no names? But we must also decide\nupon some scale of fines, for future guidance, in the event of any\nmistakes.”",
        "“There will be ample time to fix upon a scale of fines after the society\nhas been definitely established.” Li Wan replied. “There’s plenty of\nroom over in my place so let’s hold our meetings there. I’m not, it is\ntrue, a good hand at verses, but if you poets won’t treat me\ndisdainfully as a rustic boor, and if you will allow me to play the\nhostess, I may certainly also gradually become more and more refined. As\nfor conceding to me the presidentship of the society, it won’t be\nenough, of course, for me alone to preside; it will be necessary to\ninvite two others to serve as vice-presidents; you might then enlist\nLing Chou and Ou Hsieh, both of whom are cultured persons. The one to\nchoose the themes and assign the metre, the other to act as copyist and\nsupervisor. We three cannot, however, definitely say that we won’t write\nverses, for, if we come across any comparatively easy subject and metre,\nwe too will indite a stanza if we feel so disposed. But you four will\npositively have to do so. If you agree to this, well, we can proceed\nwith the society; but, if you don’t fall in with my wishes, I can’t\npresume to join you.”",
        "Ying Ch’un and Hsi Ch’un had a natural aversion for verses. What is\nmore, Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai and Lin Tai-yü were present. As soon therefore as\nthey heard these proposals, which harmonised so thoroughly with their\nown views, they both, with one voice, approved them as excellent. T’an\nCh’un and the others were likewise well aware of their object, but they\ncould not, when they saw with what willingness they accepted the charge\ninsist, with any propriety, upon their writing verses, and they felt\nobliged to say yes.",
        "“Your proposals,” she consequently said, “may be right enough; but in my\nviews they are ridiculous. For here I’ve had the trouble of initiating\nthis idea of a society, and, instead of my having anything to say in the\nmatter, I’ve been the means of making you three come and exercise\ncontrol over me.”",
        "“Well then,” Pao-yü suggested, “let’s go to the Tao Hsiang village.”",
        "“You’re always in a hurry!” Li Wan remarked. “We’re here to-day to\nsimply deliberate. So wait until I’ve sent for you again.”",
        "“It would be well,” Pao-ch’ai interposed, “that we should also decide\nevery how many days we are to meet.”",
        "“If we meet too often,” argued T’an Ch’un, “there won’t be fun in it. We\nshould simply come together two or three times in a month.”",
        "“It will be ample if we meet twice or thrice a month,” Pao-ch’ai added.\n\"But when the dates have been settled neither wind nor rain should\nprevent us. Exclusive, however, of these two days, any one in high\nspirits and disposed to have an extra meeting can either ask us to go\nover to her place, or you can all come to us; either will do well\nenough! But won’t it be more pleasant if no hard-and-fast dates were\nlaid down?”",
        "“This suggestion is excellent,” they all exclaimed.",
        "“This idea was primarily originated by me,” T’an Ch’un observed, “and I\nshould be the first to play the hostess, so that these good spirits of\nmine shouldn’t all go for nothing.”",
        "“Well, after this remark,” Li Wan proceeded, “what do you say to your\nbeing the first to convene a meeting to-morrow?”",
        "“To-morrow,” T’an Ch’un demurred, “is not as good as to-day; the best\nthing is to have it at once! You’d better therefore choose the subjects,\nwhile Ling Chou can fix the metre, and Ou Hsieh act as supervisor.”",
        "“According to my ideas,” Ying Ch’un chimed in, “we shouldn’t yield to\nthe wishes of any single person in the choice of themes and the\nsettlement of the rhythm. What would really be fair and right would be\nto draw lots.”",
        "“When I came just now,” Li Wan pursued, “I noticed them bring in two\npots of white begonias, which were simply beautiful; and why should you\nnot write some verses on them?”",
        "“Can we write verses,” Ying Ch’un retorted, “before we have as yet seen\nanything of the flowers?”",
        "“They’re purely and simply white begonias,” Pao-chai answered, “and is\nthere again any need to see them before you put together your verses?\nMen of old merely indited poetical compositions to express their good\ncheer and conceal their sentiments; had they waited to write on things\nthey had seen, why, the whole number of their works would not be in\nexistence at present!”",
        "“In that case,” Ying Ch’un said, “let me fix the metre.”",
        "With these words, she walked up to the book-case, and, extracting a\nvolume, she opened it, at random, at some verses which turned out to be\na heptameter stanza. Then handing it round for general perusal,\neverybody had to compose lines with seven words in each. Ying Ch’un next\nclosed the book of verses and addressed herself to a young waiting-maid.\n\"Just utter,” she bade her, “the first character that comes to your\nmouth.”",
        "The waiting-maid was standing, leaning against the door, so readily she\nsuggested the word “door.”",
        "“The rhyme then will be the word ’door,’” Ying Ch’un smiled, “under the\nthirteenth character ’Yuan.’ The final word of the first line is\ntherefore ’door’.”",
        "Saying this, she asked for the box with the rhyme slips, and, pulling\nout the thirteenth drawer with the character “Yuan,” she directed a\nyoung waiting-maid to take four words as they came under her hand. The\nwaiting-maid complied with her directions, and picked out four slips, on\nwhich were written “p’en, hun, hen and hun,” pot, spirit, traces and\ndusk.",
        "“The two characters pot and door,” observed Pao-yü, “are not very easy\nto rhyme with.”",
        "But Shih Shu then got ready four lots of paper and pens, share and share\nalike, and one and all quietly set to work, racking their brains to\nperform their task, with the exception of Tai-yü, who either kept on\nrubbing the dryandra flowers, or looking at the autumnal weather, or\nbandying jokes as well with the servant-girls; while Ying Ch’un ordered\na waiting-maid to light a “dream-sweet” incense stick.",
        "This “dream-sweet” stick was, it must be explained, made only about\nthree inches long and about the thickness of a lamp-wick, in order to\neasily burn down. Setting therefore her choice upon one of these as a\nlimit of time, any one who failed to accomplish the allotted task, by\nthe time the stick was consumed, had to pay a penalty.",
        "Presently, T’an Ch’un was the first to think of some verses, and, taking\nup her pen, she wrote them down; and, after submitting them to several\nalterations, she handed them up to Ying Ch’un.",
        "“Princess of Heng Wu,” she then inquired of Pao-ch’ai, “have you\nfinished?”",
        "“As for finishing, I have finished,” Pao-ch’ai rejoined; “but they’re\nworth nothing.”",
        "Pao-yü paced up and down the verandah with his hands behind his back.\n\"Have you heard?” he thereupon said to Tai-yü, “they’ve all done!”",
        "“Don’t concern yourself about me!” Tai-yü returned for answer.",
        "Pao-yü also perceived that Pao-ch’ai had already copied hers out.\n\"Dreadful!” he exclaimed. “There only remains an inch of the stick and\nI’ve only just composed four lines. The incense stick is nearly burnt\nout,” he continued, speaking to Tai-yü, “and what do you keep squatting\non that damp ground like that for?”",
        "But Tai-yü did not again worry her mind about what he said.",
        "“Well,” Pao-yü added, “I can’t be looking after you! Whether good or\nbad, I’ll write mine out too and have done.”",
        "As he spoke, he likewise drew up to the table and began putting his\nlines down.",
        "“We’ll now peruse the verses,” Li Wan interposed, “and if by the time\nwe’ve done, you haven’t as yet handed up your papers, you’ll have to be\nfined.”",
        "“Old farmer of Tao Hsiang,” Pao-yü remarked, “you’re not, it is true, a\ngood hand at writing verses, but you can read well, and, what’s more,\nyou’re the fairest of the lot; so you’d better adjudge the good and bad,\nand we’ll submit to your judgment.”",
        "“Of course!” responded the party with one voice.",
        "In due course, therefore, she first read T’an Ch’un’s draft. It ran as\nfollows:–",
        "  Verses on the Begonia.",
        "  What time the sun’s rays slant, and the grass waxeth cold, close the\n      double doors.\n  After a shower of rain, green moss plenteously covers the whole pot.\n  Beauteous is jade, but yet with thee in purity it cannot ever vie.\n  Thy frame, spotless as snow, from admiration easy robs me of my wits\n  Thy fragrant core is like unto a dot, so full of grace, so delicate!\n  When the moon reacheth the third watch, thy comely shade begins to\n      show itself.\n  Do not tell me that a chaste fairy like thee can take wings and pass\n      away.\n  How lovely are thy charms, when in thy company at dusk I sing my lay!",
        "After she had read them aloud, one and all sang their praise for a time.\nShe then took up Pao-ch’ai’s, which consisted of:",
        "  If thou would’st careful tend those fragrant lovely flowers, close of\n      a day the doors,\n  And with thine own hands take the can and sprinkle water o’er the\n      mossy pots.\n  Red, as if with cosmetic washed, are the shadows in autumn on the\n      steps.\n  Their crystal snowy bloom invites the dew on their spirits to heap\n      itself.\n  Their extreme whiteness mostly shows that they’re more comely than all\n      other flowers.\n  When much they grieve, how can their jade-like form lack the traces of\n      tears?\n  Would’st thou the god of those white flowers repay? then purity\n      need’st thou observe.\n  In silence plunges their fine bloom, now that once more day yields to\n      dusk.",
        "“After all,” observed Li Wan, “it’s the Princess of Heng Wu, who\nexpresses herself to the point.”",
        "Next they bestowed their attention on the following lines, composed by\nPao-yü:–",
        "  Thy form in autumn faint reflects against the double doors.\n  So heaps the snow in the seventh feast that it filleth thy pots.\n  Thy shade is spotless as Tai Chen, when from her bath she hails.\n  Like Hsi Tzu’s, whose hand ever pressed her heart, jade-like thy soul.\n  When the morn-ushering breeze falls not, thy thousand blossoms grieve.\n  To all thy tears the evening shower addeth another trace.\n  Alone thou lean’st against the coloured rails as if with sense imbued.\n  As heavy-hearted as the fond wife, beating clothes, or her that sadly\n      listens to the flute, thou mark’st the fall of dusk.",
        "When they had perused his verses, Pao-yü opined that T’an Ch’un’s\ncarried the palm. Li Wan was, however, inclined to concede to the\nstanza, indited by Pao-ch’ai, the credit of possessing much merit. But\nshe then went on to tell Tai-yü to look sharp.",
        "“Have you all done?” Tai-yü asked.",
        "So saying, she picked up a pen and completing her task, with a few\ndashes, she threw it to them to look over. On perusal, Li Wan and her\ncompanions found her verses to run in this strain:–",
        "  Half rolled the speckled portiere hangs, half closed the door.\n  Thy mould like broken ice it looks, jade-like thy pot.",
        "This couplet over, Pao-yü took the initiative and shouted: “Capital.\"\nBut he had just had time to inquire where she had recalled them to mind\nfrom, when they turned their mind to the succeeding lines:",
        "  Three points of whiteness from the pear petals thou steal’st;\n  And from the plum bloom its spirit thou borrowest.",
        "“Splendid!” every one (who heard) them conned over, felt impelled to\ncry. “It is a positive fact,” they said, “that her imagination is,\ncompared with that of others, quite unique.”",
        "But the rest of the composition was next considered. Its text was:",
        "  The fairy in Selene’s cavity donneth a plain attire.\n  The maiden, plunged in autumn grief, dries in her room the prints of\n      tears.\n  Winsome she blushes, in silence she’s plunged, with none a word she\n      breathes;\n  But wearily she leans against the eastern breeze, though dusk has long\n      since fall’n.",
        "“This stanza ranks above all!” they unanimously remarked, after it had\nbeen read for their benefit.",
        "“As regards beauty of thought and originality, this stanza certainly\ndeserves credit,” Li Wan asserted; “but as regards pregnancy and\nsimplicity of language, it, after all, yields to that of Heng Wu.”",
        "“This criticism is right.” T’an Ch’un put in. “That of the Hsiao Hsiang\nconsort must take second place.”",
        "“Yours, gentleman of I Hung,” Li Wan pursued, “is the last of the lot.\nDo you agreeably submit to this verdict?”",
        "“My stanza,” Pao-yü ventured, “isn’t really worth a straw. Your\ncriticism is exceedingly fair. But,” he smilingly added, “the two poems,\nwritten by Heng Wu and Hsiao Hsiang, have still to be discussed.”",
        "“You should,” argued Li Wan, “fall in with my judgment; this is no\nbusiness of any of you, so whoever says anything more will have to pay a\npenalty.”",
        "Pao-yü at this reply found that he had no alternative but to drop the\nsubject.",
        "“I decide that from henceforward,” Li Wan proceeded, “we should hold\nmeetings twice every month, on the second and sixteenth. In the\nselection of themes and the settlement of the rhymes, you’ll all have\nthen to do as I wish. But any person who may, during the intervals, feel\nso disposed, will be at perfect liberty to choose another day for an\nextra meeting. What will I care if there’s a meeting every day of the\nmoon? It will be no concern of mine, so long as when the second and\nsixteenth arrive, you do, as you’re bound to, and come over to my\nplace.”",
        "“We should, as is but right,” Pao-yü suggested, “choose some name or\nother for our society.”",
        "“Were an ordinary one chosen, it wouldn’t be nice,” T’an Ch’un\nexplained, “and anything too new-fangled, eccentric or strange won’t\nalso be quite the thing! As luck would have it, we’ve just started with\nthe poems on the begonia, so let us call it the ’Begonia Poetical\nSociety.’ This title is, it’s true, somewhat commonplace; but as it’s\npositively based on fact, it shouldn’t matter.”",
        "After this proposal of hers, they held further consultation; and\npartaking of some slight refreshments, each of them eventually retired.\nSome repaired to their quarters. Others went to dowager lady Chia’s or\nMadame Wang’s apartments. But we will leave them without further\ncomment.",
        "When Hsi Jen, for we will now come to her, perceived Pao-yü peruse the\nnote and walk off in a great flurry, along with Ts’ui Mo, she was quite\nat a loss what to make of it. Subsequently, she also saw the matrons, on\nduty at the back gate, bring two pots of begonias. Hsi Jen inquired of\nthem where they came from. The women explained to her all about them. As\nsoon as Hsi Jen heard their reply, she at once desired them to put the\nflowers in their proper places, and asked them to sit down in the lower\nrooms. She then entered the house, and, weighing six mace of silver, she\nwrapped it up properly, and fetching besides three hundred cash, she\ncame over and handed both the amounts to the two matrons. “This silver,\"\nshe said, “is a present for the boys, who carried the flowers; and these\ncash are for you to buy yourselves a cup of tea with.”",
        "The women rose to their feet in such high glee that their eyebrows\ndilated and their eyes smiled; but, though they waxed eloquent in the\nexpression of their deep gratitude, they would not accept the money. It\nwas only after they had perceived how obstinate Hsi Jen was in not\ntaking it back that they at last volunteered to keep it.",
        "“Are there,” Hsi Jen then inquired, “any servant-boys on duty outside\nthe back gate?”",
        "“There are four of them every day,” answered one of the matrons.\n\"They’re put there with the sole idea of attending to any orders that\nmight be given them from inside. But, Miss, if you’ve anything to order\nthem to do, we’ll go and deliver your message.”",
        "“What orders can I have to give them?” Hsi Jen laughed. “Mr. Pao, our\nmaster Secundus, was purposing to send some one to-day to the young\nmarquis’ house to take something over to Miss Shih. But you come at an\nopportune moment so you might, on your way out, tell the servant-boys at\nthe back gate to hire a carriage; and on its return you can come here\nand get the money. But don’t let them rush recklessly against people in\nthe front part of the compound!”",
        "The matrons signified their obedience and took their leave. Hsi Jen\nretraced her steps into the house to fetch a tray in which to place the\npresents intended for Shih Hsiang-yün, but she discovered the shelf for\ntrays empty. Upon turning round, however, she caught sight of Ch’ing\nWen, Ch’iu Wen, She Yüeh and the other girls, seated together, busy with\ntheir needlework. “Where is the white cornelian tray with twisted\nthreads gone to?” Hsi Jen asked.",
        "At this question, one looked at the one, and the other stared at the\nother, but none of them could remember anything about it. After a\nprotracted lapse of time, Ch’ing Wen smiled. “It was taken to Miss\nTertia’s with a present of lichees,” she rejoined, “and it hasn’t as yet\nbeen returned.”",
        "“There are plenty of articles,” Hsi Jen remarked, “for sending over\nthings on ordinary occasions; and do you deliberately go and carry this\noff?”",
        "“Didn’t I maintain the same thing?” Ch’ing Wen retorted. “But so well\ndid this tray match with the fresh lichees it contained, that when I\ntook it over, Miss T’an Ch’un herself noticed the fact. ’How splendid,’\nshe said, and lo, putting even the tray by, she never had it brought\nover. But, look! hasn’t the pair of beaded vases, which stood on the\nvery top of that shelf, been fetched as yet?”",
        "“The mention of these vases,” Ch’iu Wen laughed, “reminds me again of a\nfunny incident. Whenever our Mr. Pao-yü’s filial piety is aroused, he\nshows himself filial over and above the highest degree! The other day,\nhe espied the olea flowers in the park, and he plucked two twigs. His\noriginal idea was to place them in a vase for himself, but a sudden\nthought struck him. ’These are flowers,’ he mused, ’which have newly\nopened in our garden, so how can I presume to be the first to enjoy\nthem?’ And actually taking down that pair of vases, he filled them with\nwater with his own hands, put the flowers in, and, calling a servant to\ncarry them, he in person took one of the vases into dowager lady Chia’s,\nand then took the other to Madame Wang’s. But, as it happens, even his\nattendants reap some benefit, when once his filial feelings are stirred\nup! As luck would have it, the one who carried the vases over on that\nday was myself. The sight of these flowers so enchanted our venerable\nlady that there was nothing that she wouldn’t do. ’Pao-yü,’ she said to\nevery one she met, ’is the one, after all, who shows me much attention.\nSo much so, that he has even thought of bringing me a twig of flowers!\nAnd yet, the others bear me a grudge on account of the love that I\nlavish on him!’ Our venerable mistress, you all know very well, has\nnever had much to say to me. I have all along not been much of a\nfavourite in the old lady’s eyes. But on that occasion she verily\ndirected some one to give me several hundreds of cash. ’I was to be\npitied,’ she observed, ’for being born with a weak physique!’ This was,\nindeed, an unforeseen piece of good luck! The several hundreds of cash\nare a mere trifle; but what’s not easy to get is this sort of honour!\nAfter that, we went over into Madame Wang’s. Madame Wang was, at the\ntime, with our lady Secunda, Mrs. Chao, and a whole lot of people;\nturning the boxes topsy-turvey, trying to find some coloured clothes her\nladyship had worn long ago in her youth, so as to give them to some one\nor other. Who it was, I don’t know. But the moment she saw us, she did\nnot even think of searching for any clothes, but got lost in admiration\nfor the flowers. Our lady Secunda was also standing by, and she made\nsport of the matter. She extolled our master Pao, for his filial piety\nand for his knowledge of right and wrong; and what with what was true\nand what wasn’t, she came out with two cart-loads of compliments. These\nthings spoken in the presence of the whole company so added to Madame\nWang’s lustre and sealed every one’s mouth, that her ladyship was more\nand more filled with gratification, and she gave me two ready-made\nclothes as a present. These too are of no consequence; one way or\nanother, we get some every year; but nothing can come up to this sort of\nlucky chance!”",
        "“Psha!” Ch’ing Wen ejaculated with a significant smile, “you are indeed\na mean thing, who has seen nothing of the world! She gave the good ones\nto others and the refuse to you; and do you still pat on all this side?”",
        "“No matter whether what she gave me was refuse or not,” Ch’iu Wen\nprotested, “it’s, after all, an act of bounty on the part of her\nladyship.”",
        "“Had it been myself,” Ch’ing Wen pursued, “I would at once have refused\nthem! It wouldn’t have mattered if she had given me what had been left\nby some one else; but we all stand on an equal footing in these rooms,\nand is there any one, forsooth, so much the more exalted or honorable\nthan the other as to justify her taking what is good and bestowing it\nupon her and giving me what is left? I had rather not take them! I might\nhave had to give offence to Madame Wang, but I wouldn’t have put up with\nsuch a slight!”",
        "“To whom did she give any in these rooms?” Ch’iu Wen vehemently\ninquired. “I was unwell and went home for several days, so that I am not\naware to whom any were given. Dear sister, do tell me who it is so that\nI may know.”",
        "“Were I to tell you,” Ch’ing Wen rejoined, “is it likely that you would\nreturn them at this hour to Madame Wang?”",
        "“What nonsense,” Ch’iu Wen laughed. “Ever since I’ve heard about it,\nI’ve been delighted and happy. No matter if she even bestowed upon me\nwhat remained from anything given to a dog in these rooms, I would have\nbeen thankful for her ladyship’s kindness. I wouldn’t have worried my\nmind with anything else!”",
        "After listening to her, everybody laughed. “Doesn’t she know how to jeer\nin fine style!” they ejaculated unanimously; “for weren’t they given to\nthat foreign spotted pug dog?”",
        "“You lot of filthy-tongued creatures!” Hsi Jen laughed, “when you’ve got\nnothing to do, you make me the scapegoat to crack your jokes, and poke\nyour fun at! But what kind of death will, I wonder, each of you have!”",
        "“Was it verily you, sister, who got them?” Ch’iu Wen asked with a smile.\n\"I assure you I had no idea about it! I tender you my apologies.”",
        "“You might be a little less domineering!” Hsi Jen remarked smilingly.\n\"The thing now is, who of you will go and fetch the tray.”",
        "“The vases too,” Shih Yüeh suggested, “must be got back when there’s any\ntime to spare; for there’s nothing to say about our venerable mistress’\nquarters, but Madame Wang’s apartments teem with people and many hands.\nThe rest are all right; but Mrs. Chao and all that company will, when\nthey see that the vase hails from these rooms, surely again foster evil\ndesigns, and they won’t feel happy until they’ve done all they can to\nspoil it! Besides, Madame Wang doesn’t trouble herself about such\nthings. So had we not as well bring it over a moment sooner?”",
        "Hearing this, Ch’ing Wen threw down her needlework. “What you say is\nperfectly right,” she assented, “so you’d better let me go and fetch\nit.”",
        "“I’ll, after all, go for it.” Ch’iu Wen cried. “You can go and get that\ntray of yours!”",
        "“You should let me once go for something!” Ch’ing Wen pleaded. “Whenever\nany lucky chance has turned up, you’ve invariably grabbed it; and can it\nbe that you won’t let me have a single turn?”",
        "“Altogether,” She Yüeh said laughingly, “that girl Ch’iu Wen got a few\nclothes just once; can such a lucky coincidence present itself again\ntoday that you too should find them engaged in searching for clothes?”",
        "“Albeit I mayn’t come across any clothes,” Ch’ing Wen rejoined with a\nsardonic smile, “our Madame Wang may notice how diligent I am, and\napportion me a couple of taels out of her public expenses; there’s no\nsaying.” Continuing, “Don’t you people,” she laughed, “try and play your\npranks with me; for is there anything that I don’t twig?”",
        "As she spoke, she ran outside. Ch’iu Wen too left the room in her\ncompany; but she repaired to T’an Ch’un’s quarters and fetched the tray.",
        "Hsi Jen then got everything ready. Calling an old nurse attached to the\nsame place as herself, Sung by name, “Just go first and wash, comb your\nhair and put on your out-of-door clothes,” she said to her, “and then\ncome back as I want to send you at once with a present to Miss Shih.”",
        "“Miss,” urged the nurse Sung, “just give me what you have; and, if you\nhave any message, tell it me; so that when I’ve tidied myself I may go\nstraightway.”",
        "Hsi Jen, at this proposal, brought two small twisted wire boxes; and,\nopening first the one in which were two kinds of fresh fruits,\nconsisting of caltrops and “chicken head” fruit, and afterwards\nuncovering the other, containing a tray with new cakes, made of chestnut\npowder, and steamed in sugar, scented with the olea, “All these fresh\nfruits are newly plucked this year from our own garden,” she observed;\n\"our Mr. Secundus sends them to Miss Shih to taste. The other day, too,\nshe was quite taken with this cornelian tray so let her keep it for her\nuse. In this silk bag she’ll find the work, which she asked me some time\nago to do for her. (Tell her) that she mustn’t despise it for its\ncoarseness, but make the best of it and turn it to some account. Present\nrespects to her from our part and inquire after her health on behalf of\nMr. Pao-yü; that will be all there’s to say.”",
        "“Has Mr. Pao, I wonder, anything more for me to tell her?” the nurse\nSung added, “Miss, do go and inquire, so that on my return, he mayn’t\nagain say that I forgot.”",
        "“He was just now,” Hsi Jen consequently asked Ch’iu Wen, “over there in\nMiss Tertia’s rooms, wasn’t he?”",
        "“They were all assembled there, deliberating about starting some\npoetical society or other,” Ch’iu Wen explained, “and they all wrote\nverses too. But I fancy he’s got no message to give you; so you might as\nwell start.”",
        "After this assurance, nurse Sung forthwith took the things, and quitted\nthe apartment. When she had changed her clothes and arranged her hair,\nHsi Jen further enjoined them to go by the back door, where there was a\nservant-boy, waiting with a curricle. Nurse Sung thereupon set out on\nher errand. But we will leave her for the present.",
        "In a little time Pao-yü came back. After first cursorily glancing at the\nbegonias for a time, he walked into his rooms, and explained to Hsi Jen\nall about the poetical society they had managed to establish, Hsi Jen\nthen told him that she had sent the nurse Sung along with some things,\nto Shih Hsiang-yün. As soon as Pao-yü heard this, he clapped his hands.\n\"I forgot all about her!” he cried. “I knew very well that I had\nsomething to attend to; but I couldn’t remember what it was! Luckily,\nyou’ve alluded to her! I was just meaning to ask her to come, for what\nfun will there be in this poetical society without her?”",
        "“Is this of any serious import?” Hsi Jen reasoned with him. “It’s all,\nfor the mere sake of recreation! She’s not however able to go about at\nher own free will as you people do. Nor can she at home have her own\nway. When you therefore let her know, it won’t again rest with her,\nhowever willing she may be to avail herself of your invitation. And if\nshe can’t come, she will long and crave to be with you all, so isn’t it\nbetter that you shouldn’t be the means of making her unhappy?”",
        "“Never mind!” responded Pao-yü. “I’ll tell our venerable senior to\ndespatch some one to bring her over.”",
        "But in the middle of their conversation, nurse Sung returned already\nfrom her mission, and expressed to him, (Hsiang-yün’s) acknowledgment;\nand to Hsi Jen her thanks for the trouble. “She also inquired,” the\nnurse proceeded, “what you, master Secundus, were up to, and I told her\nthat you had started some poetical club or other with the young ladies\nand that you were engaged in writing verses. Miss Shih wondered why it\nwas, if you were writing verses, that you didn’t even mention anything\nto her; and she was extremely distressed about it.”",
        "Pao-yü, at these words, turned himself round and betook himself\nimmediately into his grandmother’s apartments, where he did all that lay\nin his power to urge her to depute servants to go and fetch her.",
        "“It’s too late to-day,” dowager lady Chia answered; “they’ll go\ntomorrow, as soon as it’s daylight.”",
        "Pao-yü had no other course but to accede to her wishes. He, however,\nretraced his steps back to his room with a heavy heart. On the morrow,\nat early dawn, he paid another visit to old lady Chia and brought\npressure to bear on her until she sent some one for her. Soon after\nmidday, Shih Hsiang-yün arrived. Pao-yü felt at length much relieved in\nhis mind. Upon meeting her, he recounted to her all that had taken place\nfrom beginning to end. His purpose was likewise to let her see the\npoetical composition, but Li Wan and the others remonstrated. “Don’t,\"\nthey said, “allow her to see them! First tell her the rhymes and number\nof feet; and, as she comes late, she should, as a first step, pay a\npenalty by conforming to the task we had to do. Should what she writes\nbe good, then she can readily be admitted as a member of the society;\nbut if not good, she should be further punished by being made to stand a\ntreat; after which, we can decide what’s to be done.”",
        "“You’ve forgotten to ask me round,” Hsiang-yün laughed, “and I should,\nafter all, fine you people! But produce the metre; for though I don’t\nexcel in versifying, I shall exert myself to do the best I can, so as to\nget rid of every slur. If you will admit me into the club, I shall be\neven willing to sweep the floors and burn the incense.”",
        "When they all saw how full of fun she was, they felt more than ever\ndelighted with her and they reproached themselves, for having somehow or\nother managed to forget her on the previous day. But they lost no time\nin telling her the metre of the verses.",
        "Shih Hsiang-yün was inwardly in ecstasies. So much so, that she could\nnot wait to beat the tattoo and effect any alterations. But having\nsucceeded, while conversing with her cousins, in devising a stanza in\nher mind, she promptly inscribed it on the first piece of paper that\ncame to hand. “I have,” she remarked, with a precursory smile, “stuck to\nthe metre and written two stanzas. Whether they be good or bad, I cannot\nsay; all I’ve kept in view was to simply comply with your wishes.”",
        "So speaking, she handed her paper to the company.",
        "“We thought our four stanzas,” they observed, “had so thoroughly\nexhausted everything that could be imagined on the subject that another\nstanza was out of the question, and there you’ve devised a couple more!\nHow could there be so much to say? These must be mere repetitions of our\nown sentiments.”",
        "While bandying words, they perused her two stanzas. They found this to\nbe their burden:",
        "No. 1.",
        "  The fairies yesterday came down within the city gates,\n  And like those gems, sown in the grassy field, planted one pot.\n  How clear it is that the goddess of frost is fond of cold!\n  It is no question of a pretty girl bent upon death!\n  Where does the snow, which comes in gloomy weather, issue from?\n  The drops of rain increase the prints, left from the previous night.\n  How the flowers rejoice that bards are not weary of song!\n  But are they ever left to spend in peace a day or night?",
        "No. 2.",
        "  The “heng chih” covered steps lead to the creeper-laden door.\n  How fit to plant by the corner of walls; how fit for pots?\n  The flowers so relish purity that they can’t find a mate.\n  Easy in autumn snaps the soul of sorrow-wasted man.\n  The tears, which from the jade-like candle drip, dry in the wind.\n  The crystal-like portiere asunder rends Selene’s rays.\n  Their private feelings to the moon goddess they longed to tell,\n  But gone, alas! is the lustre she shed on the empty court!",
        "Every line filled them with wonder and admiration. What they read, they\npraised. “This,” they exclaimed, with one consent, “is not writing\nverses on the begonia for no purpose! We must really start a Begonia\nSociety!”",
        "“To-morrow,” Shih Hsiang-yün proposed, “first fine me by making me stand\na treat, and letting me be the first to convene a meeting; may I?”",
        "“This would be far better!” they all assented. So producing also the\nverses, composed the previous day, they submitted them to her for\ncriticism.",
        "In the evening, Hsiang-yün came at the invitation of Pao-ch’ai, to the\nHeng Wu Yüan to put up with her for the night. By lamplight, Hsiang-yün\nconsulted with her how she was to play the hostess and fix upon the\nthemes; but, after lending a patient ear to all her proposals for a long\ntime, Pao-ch’ai thought them so unsuitable for the occasion, that\nturning towards her, she raised objections. “If you want,” she said, “to\nhold a meeting, you have to pay the piper. And albeit it’s for mere fun,\nyou have to make every possible provision; for while consulting your own\ninterests, you must guard against giving umbrage to people. In that case\nevery one will afterwards be happy and contented. You count for nothing\ntoo in your own home; and the whole lump sum of those few tiaos, you\ndraw each month, are not sufficient for your own wants, and do you now\nalso wish to burden yourself with this useless sort of thing? Why, if\nyour aunt gets wind of it, won’t she be more incensed with you than\never! What’s more, even though you might fork out all the money you can\ncall your own to bear the outlay of this entertainment with, it won’t be\nanything like enough, and can it possibly be, pray, that you would go\nhome for the express purpose of requisitioning the necessary funds? Or\nwill you perchance ask for some from in here?”",
        "This long tirade had the effect of bringing the true facts of the case\nto Hsiang-yün’s notice, and she began to waver in a state of\nuncertainty.",
        "“I have already fixed upon a plan in my mind,” Pao-ch’ai resumed.\n\"There’s an assistant in our pawnshop from whose family farm come some\nsplendid crabs. Some time back, he sent us a few as a present, and now,\nstarting from our venerable senior and including the inmates of the\nupper quarters, most of them are quite in love with crabs. It was only\nthe other day that my mother mentioned that she intended inviting our\nworthy ancestor into the garden to look at the olea flowers and partake\nof crabs, but she has had her hands so full that she hasn’t as yet asked\nher round. So just you now drop the poetical meeting, and invite the\nwhole crowd to a show; and if we wait until they go, won’t we be able to\nindite as many poems as we like? But let me speak to my brother and ask\nhim to let us have several baskets of the fattest and largest crabs he\ncan get, and to also go to some shop and fetch several jars of luscious\nwine. And if we then lay out four or five tables with plates full of\nrefreshments, won’t we save trouble and all have a jolly time as well?”",
        "As soon as Hsiang-yün heard (the alternative proposed by Pao-ch’ai,) she\nfelt her heart throb with gratitude and in most profuse terms she\npraised her for her forethought.",
        "“The proposal I’ve made.” Pao-ch’ai pursued smilingly; “is prompted\nentirely by my sincere feelings for you; so whatever you do don’t be\ntouchy and imagine that I look down upon you; for in that case we two\nwill have been good friends all in vain. But if you won’t give way to\nsuspicion, I’ll be able to tell them at once to go and get things\nready.”",
        "“My dear cousin,” eagerly rejoined Hsiang-yün, a smile on her lips, “if\nyou say these things it’s you who treat me with suspicion; for no matter\nhow foolish a person I may be, as not to even know what’s good and bad,\nI’m still a human being! Did I not regard you, cousin, in the same light\nas my own very sister, I wouldn’t last time have had any wish or\ninclination to disclose to you every bit of those troubles, which\nordinarily fall to my share at home.”",
        "After listening to these assurances, Pao-ch’ai summoned a matron and\nbade her go out and tell her master, Hsüeh P’an, to procure a few\nhampers of crabs of the same kind as those which were sent on the\nprevious occasion. “Our venerable senior,” (she said,) “and aunt Wang\nare asked to come to-morrow after their meal and admire the olea\nflowers, so mind, impress upon your master to please not forget, as I’ve\nalready to-day issued the invitations.”",
        "The matron walked out of the garden and distinctly delivered the\nmessage. But, on her return, she brought no reply.",
        "During this while, Pao-ch’ai continued her conversation with Hsiang-yün.\n\"The themes for the verses,” she advised her, “mustn’t also be too\nout-of-the-way. Just search the works of old writers, and where will you\nfind any eccentric and peculiar subjects, or any extra difficult metre!\nIf the subject be too much out-of-the-way and the metre too difficult,\none cannot get good verses. In a word, we are a mean lot and our verses\nare certain, I fear, to consist of mere repetitions. Nor is it advisable\nfor us to aim at excessive originality. The first thing for us to do is\nto have our ideas clear, as our language will then not be commonplace.\nIn fact, this sort of thing is no vital matter; spinning and needlework\nare, in a word, the legitimate duties of you and me. Yet, if we can at\nany time afford the leisure, it’s only right and proper that we should\ntake some book, that will benefit both body and mind, and read a few\nchapters out of it.”",
        "Hsiang-yün simply signified her assent. “I’m now cogitating in my mind,\"\nshe then laughingly remarked, “that as the verses we wrote yesterday\ntreated of begonias, we should, I think, compose on this occasion some\non chrysanthemums, eh? What do you say?”",
        "“Chrysanthemums are in season,” Pao-ch’ai replied. “The only objection\nto them is that too many writers of old have made them the subject of\ntheir poems.”",
        "“I also think so,” Hsiang-yün added, “so that, I fear, we shall only be\nfollowing in their footsteps.”",
        "After some reflection, Pao-ch’ai exclaimed, “I’ve hit upon something! If\nwe take, for the present instance, the chrysanthemums as a secondary\nterm, and man as the primary, we can, after all, select several themes.\nBut they must all consist of two characters: the one, an empty word; the\nother, a full one. The full word might be chrysanthemums; while for the\nempty one, we might employ some word in general use. In this manner, we\nshall, on one hand, sing the chrysanthemum; and, on the other, compose\nverses on the theme. And as old writers have not written much in this\nstyle, it will be impossible for us to drift into the groove of their\nideas. Thus in versifying on the scenery and in singing the objects, we\nwill, in both respects, combine originality with liberality of thought.”",
        "“This is all very well,” smiled Hsiang-yün. “The only thing is what kind\nof empty words will, I wonder, be best to use? Just you first think of\none and let me see.”",
        "Pao-ch’ai plunged in thought for a time, after which she laughingly\nremarked: “Dream of chrysanthemums is good.”",
        "“It’s positively good!” Hsiang-yün smiled. “I’ve also got one: ’the\nChrysanthemum shadow,’ will that do?”",
        "“Well enough,” Pao-ch’ai answered, “the only objection is that people\nhave written on it; yet if the themes are to be many, we might throw\nthis in. I’ve got another one too!”",
        "“Be quick, and tell it!” Hsiang-yün urged.",
        "“What do you say to ’ask the Chrysanthemums?’” Pao-ch’ai observed.",
        "Hsiang-yün clapped her hand on the table. “Capital,” she cried. “I’ve\nthought of one also.” She then quickly continued, “It is, search for\nchrysanthemums; what’s your idea about it?”",
        "Pao-ch’ai thought that too would do very well. “Let’s choose ten of them\nfirst,” she next proposed; “and afterwards note them down!”",
        "While talking, they rubbed the ink and moistened the pens. These\npreparations over, Hsiang-yün began to write, while Pao-ch’ai enumerated\nthe themes. In a short time, they got ten of them.",
        "“Ten don’t form a set,” Hsiang-yün went on to smilingly suggest, after\nreading them over. “We’d better complete them by raising their number to\ntwelve; they’ll then also be on the same footing as people’s pictures\nand books.”",
        "Hearing this proposal, Pao-ch’ai devised another couple of themes, thus\nbringing them to a dozen. “Well, since we’ve got so far,” she pursued,\n\"let’s go one step further and copy them out in their proper order,\nputting those that are first, first; and those that come last, last.”",
        "“It would be still better like that,” Hsiang-yün acquiesced, “as we’ll\nbe able to make up a ’chrysanthemum book.’”",
        "“The first stanza should be: ’Longing for chrysanthemums,’” Pao-chai\nsaid, “and as one cannot get them by wishing, and has, in consequence,\nto search for them, the second should be ’searching for chrysanthemums.’\nAfter due search, one finds them, and plants them, so the third must be:\n’planting chrysanthemums.’ After they’ve been planted, they, blossom,\nand one faces them and enjoys them, so the fourth should be ’facing the\nchrysanthemums.’ By facing them, one derives such excessive delight that\none plucks them and brings them in and puts them in vases for one’s own\ndelectation, so the fifth must be ’placing chrysanthemums in vases.’ If\nno verses are sung in their praise, after they’ve been placed in vases,\nit’s tantamount to seeing no point of beauty in chrysanthemums, so the\nsixth must be ’sing about chrysanthemums.’ After making them the burden\nof one’s song, one can’t help representing them in pictures. The seventh\nplace should therefore be conceded to ’drawing chrysanthemums.’ Seeing\nthat in spite of all the labour bestowed on the drawing of\nchrysanthemums, the fine traits there may be about them are not yet, in\nfact, apparent, one impulsively tries to find them out by inquiries, so\nthe eighth should be ’asking the chrysanthemums.’ As any perception,\nwhich the chrysanthemums might display in fathoming the questions set\nwould help to make the inquirer immoderately happy, the ninth must be\n’pinning the chrysanthemums in the hair.’ And as after everything has\nbeen accomplished, that comes within the sphere of man, there will\nremain still some chrysanthemums about which something could be written,\ntwo stanzas on the ’shadow of the chrysanthemums,’ and the ’dream about\nchrysanthemums’ must be tagged on as numbers ten and eleven. While the\nlast section should be ’the withering of the chrysanthemums’ so as to\nbring to a close the sentiments expressed in the foregoing subjects. In\nthis wise the fine scenery and fine doings of the third part of autumn,\nwill both alike be included in our themes.”",
        "Hsiang-yün signified her approval, and taking the list she copied it out\nclean. But after once more passing her eye over it, she went on to\ninquire what rhymes should be determined upon.",
        "“I do not, as a rule, like hard-and-fast rhymes,” Pao-ch’ai retorted.\n\"It’s evident enough that we can have good verses without them, so\nwhat’s the use of any rhymes to shackle us? Don’t let us imitate that\nmean lot of people. Let’s simply choose our subject and pay no notice to\nrhymes. Our main object is to see whether we cannot by chance hit upon\nsome well-written lines for the sake of fun. It isn’t to make this the\nmeans of subjecting people to perplexities.”",
        "“What you say is perfectly right,” Hsiang-yün observed. “In this manner\nour poetical composition will improve one step higher. But we only\nmuster five members, and there are here twelve themes. Is it likely that\neach one of us will have to indite verses on all twelve?”",
        "“That would be far too hard on the members!” Pao-ch’ai rejoined. “But\nlet’s copy out the themes clean, for lines with seven words will have to\nbe written on every one, and stick them to-morrow on the wall for\ngeneral perusal. Each member can write on the subject which may be most\nin his or her line. Those, with any ability, may choose all twelve.\nWhile those, with none, may only limit themselves to one stanza. Both\nwill do. Those, however, who will show high mental capacity, combined\nwith quickness, will be held the best. But any one, who shall have\ncompleted all twelve themes, won’t be permitted to hasten and begin over\nagain; we’ll have to fine such a one, and finish.”",
        "“Yes, that will do,” assented Hsiang-yün. But after settling everything\nsatisfactorily, they extinguished the lamp and went to bed.",
        "Reader, do you want to know what subsequently took place? If you do,\nthen listen to what is contained in the way of explanation in the\nfollowing chapter.",
        "  Lin Hsiao-Hsiang carries the first prize in the poems on\n      chrysanthemums.\n  Hsueh Heng-wu chaffs Pao-yü by composing verses in the same style as\n      his on the crabs.",
        "After Pao-ch’ai and Hsiang-yün, we will now explain, settled everything\nin their deliberations, nothing memorable occurred, the whole night,\nwhich deserves to be put on record.",
        "The next day, Hsiang-yün invited dowager lady Chia and her other\nrelatives to come and look at the olea flowers. Old lady Chia and every\none else answered that as she had had the kind attention to ask them,\nthey felt it their duty to avail themselves of her gracious invitation,\nmuch though they would be putting her to trouble and inconvenience. At\ntwelve o’clock, therefore, old lady Chia actually took with her Madame\nWang and lady Feng, as well as Mrs. Hsüeh and other members of her\nfamily whom she had asked to join them, and repaired into the garden.",
        "“Which is the best spot?” old lady Chia inquired.",
        "“We are ready to go wherever you may like, dear senior,” Madame Wang\nventured in response.",
        "“A collation has already been spread in the Lotus Fragrance Arbour,\"\nlady Feng interposed. “Besides, the two olea plants, on that hill,\nyonder, are now lovely in their full blossom, and the water of that\nstream is jade-like and pellucid, so if we sit in the pavilion in the\nmiddle of it, won’t we enjoy an open and bright view? It will be\nrefreshing too to our eyes to watch the pool.”",
        "“Quite right!” assented dowager lady Chia at this suggestion; and while\nexpressing her approbation, she ushered her train of followers into the\nArbour of Lotus Fragrance.",
        "This Arbour of Lotus Fragrance had, in fact, been erected in the centre\nof the pool. It had windows on all four sides. On the left and on the\nright, stood covered passages, which spanned the stream and connected\nwith the hills. At the back, figured a winding bridge.",
        "As the party ascended the bamboo bridge, lady Feng promptly advanced and\nsupported dowager lady Chia. “Venerable ancestor,” she said, “just walk\nboldly and with confident step; there’s nothing to fear; it’s the way of\nthese bamboo bridges to go on creaking like this.”",
        "Presently, they entered the arbour. Here they saw two additional bamboo\ntables, placed beyond the balustrade. On the one, were arranged cups,\nchopsticks and every article necessary for drinking wine. On the other,\nwere laid bamboo utensils for tea, a tea-service and various cups and\nsaucers. On the off side, two or three waiting-maids were engaged in\nfanning the stove to boil the water for tea. On the near side were\nvisible several other girls, who were trying with their fans to get a\nfire to light in the stove so as to warm the wines.",
        "“It was a capital idea,” dowager lady Chia hastily exclaimed laughingly\nwith vehemence, “to bring tea here. What’s more, the spot and the\nappurtenances are alike so spick and span!”",
        "“These things were brought by cousin Pao-ch’ai,” Hsiang-yün smilingly\nexplained, “so I got them ready.”",
        "“This child is, I say, so scrupulously particular,” old lady Chia\nobserved, “that everything she does is thoroughly devised.”",
        "As she gave utterance to her feelings, her attention was attracted by a\npair of scrolls of black lacquer, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, suspended\non the pillars, and she asked Hsiang-yün to tell her what the mottoes\nwere.",
        "The text she read was:",
        "  Snapped is the shade of the hibiscus by the fragrant oar of a boat\n      homeward bound.\n  Deep flows the perfume of the lily and the lotus underneath the bamboo\n      bridge.",
        "After listening to the motto, old lady Chia raised her head and cast a\nglance upon the tablet; then turning round: “Long ago, when I was\nyoung,” she observed, addressing herself to Mrs. Hsüeh, “we likewise had\nat home a pavilion like this called ’the Hall reclining on the russet\nclouds,’ or some other such name. At that time, I was of the same age as\nthe girls, and my wont was to go day after day and play with my sisters\nthere. One day, I, unexpectedly, slipped and fell into the water, and I\nhad a narrow escape from being drowned; for it was after great\ndifficulty, that they managed to drag me out safe and sound. But my head\nwas, after all, bumped about against the wooden nails; so much so, that\nthis hole of the length of a finger, which you can see up to this day on\nmy temple, comes from the bruises I sustained. All my people were in a\nfunk that I’d be the worse for this ducking and continued in fear and\ntrembling lest I should catch a chill. ’It was dreadful, dreadful!’ they\nopined, but I managed, little though every one thought it, to keep in\nsplendid health.”",
        "Lady Feng allowed no time to any one else to put in a word; but\nanticipating them: “Had you then not survived, who would now be enjoying\nthese immense blessings!” she smiled. “This makes it evident that no\nsmall amount of happiness and long life were in store for you, venerable\nancestor, from your very youth up! It was by the agency of the spirits\nthat this hole was knocked open so that they might fill it up with\nhappiness and longevity! The old man Shou Hsing had, in fact, a hole in\nhis head, which was so full of every kind of blessing conducive to\nhappiness and long life that it bulged up ever so high!”",
        "Before, however, she could conclude, dowager lady Chia and the rest were\nconvulsed with such laughter that their bodies doubled in two.",
        "“This monkey is given to dreadful tricks!” laughed old lady Chia. “She’s\nalways ready to make a scapegoat of me to evoke amusement. But would\nthat I could take that glib mouth of yours and rend it in pieces.”",
        "“It’s because I feared that the cold might, when you by and bye have\nsome crabs to eat, accumulate in your intestines,” lady Feng pleaded,\n\"that I tried to induce you, dear senior, to have a laugh, so as to make\nyou gay and merry. For one can, when in high spirits, indulge in a\ncouple of them more with impunity.”",
        "“By and bye,” smiled old lady Chia, “I’ll make you follow me day and\nnight, so that I may constantly be amused and feel my mind diverted; I\nwon’t let you go back to your home.”",
        "“It’s that weakness of yours for her, venerable senior,” Madame Wang\nobserved with a smile, “that has got her into the way of behaving in\nthis manner, and, if you go on speaking to her as you do, she’ll soon\nbecome ever so much the more unreasonable.”",
        "“I like her such as she is,” dowager lady Chia laughed. “Besides, she’s\ntruly no child, ignorant of the distinction between high and low. When\nwe are at home, with no strangers present, we ladies should be on terms\nlike these, and as long, in fact, as we don’t overstep propriety, it’s\nall right. If not, what would he the earthly use of making them behave\nlike so many saints?”",
        "While bandying words, they entered the pavilion in a body. After tea,\nlady Feng hastened to lay out the cups and chopsticks. At the upper\ntable then seated herself old lady Chia, Mrs. Hsüeh, Pao-ch’ai, Tai-yü\nand Pao-yü. Round the table, on the east, sat Shih Hsiang-yün, Madame\nWang, Ying Ch’un, T’an Ch’un and Hsi Ch’un. At the small table, leaning\nagainst the door on the west side, Li Wan and lady Feng assigned\nthemselves places. But it was for the mere sake of appearances, as\nneither of them ventured to sit down, but remained in attendance at the\ntwo tables, occupied by old lady Chia and Madame Wang.",
        "“You’d better,” lady Feng said, “not bring in too many crabs at a time.\nThrow these again into the steaming-basket! Only serve ten; and when\nthey’re eaten, a fresh supply can be fetched!”",
        "Asking, at the same time, for water, she washed her hands, and, taking\nher position near dowager lady Chia, she scooped out the meat from a\ncrab, and offered the first help to Mrs. Hsüeh.",
        "“They’ll be sweeter were I to open them with my own hands,” Mrs. Hsüeh\nremarked, “there’s no need for any one to serve me.”",
        "Lady Feng, therefore, presented it to old lady Chia and handed a second\nportion to Pao-yü.",
        "“Make the wine as warm as possible and bring it in!” she then went on to\ncry. “Go,” she added, directing the servant-girls, “and fetch the\npowder, made of green beans, and scented with the leaves of\nchrysanthemums and the stamens of the olea fragrans; and keep it ready\nto rinse our hands with.”",
        "Shih Hsiang-yün had a crab to bear the others company, but no sooner had\nshe done than she retired to a lower seat, from where she helped her\nguests. When she, however, walked out a second time to give orders to\nfill two dishes and send them over to Mrs. Chao, she perceived lady Feng\ncome up to her again. “You’re not accustomed to entertaining,” she said,\n\"so go and have your share to eat. I’ll attend to the people for you\nfirst, and, when they’ve gone, I’ll have all I want.”",
        "Hsiang-yün would not agree to her proposal. But giving further\ndirections to the servants to spread two tables under the verandah on\nthe off-side, she pressed Yüan Yang, Hu Po, Ts’ai Hsia, Ts’ai Yün and\nP’ing Erh to go and seat themselves.",
        "“Lady Secunda,” consequently ventured Yüan Yang, “you’re in here doing\nthe honours, so may I go and have something to eat?”",
        "“You can all go,” replied lady Feng; “leave everything in my charge, and\nit will be all right.”",
        "While these words were being spoken, Shih Hsiang-yün resumed her place\nat the banquet. Lady Feng and Li Wan then took hurry-scurry something to\neat as a matter of form; but lady Feng came down once more to look after\nthings. After a time, she stepped out on the verandah where Yüan Yang\nand the other girls were having their refreshments in high glee. As soon\nas they caught sight of her, Yuan Yang and her companions stood up.\n\"What has your ladyship come out again for?” they inquired. “Do let us\nalso enjoy a little peace and quiet!”",
        "“This chit Yüan Yang is worse than ever!” lady Feng laughed. “Here I’m\nslaving away for you, and, instead of feeling grateful to me, you bear\nme a grudge! But don’t you yet quick pour me a cup of wine?”",
        "Yüan Yang immediately smiled, and filling a cup, she applied it to lady\nFeng’s lips. Lady Feng stretched out her neck and emptied it. But Hu Po\nand Ts’ai Hsia thereupon likewise replenished a cup and put it to lady\nFeng’s mouth. Lady Feng swallowed the contents of that as well. P’ing\nErh had, by this time, brought her some yellow meat which she had picked\nout from the shell. “Pour plenty of ginger and vinegar!” shouted lady\nFeng, and, in a moment, she made short work of that too. “You people,\"\nshe smiled, “had better sit down and have something to eat, for I’m off\nnow.”",
        "“You brazen-faced thing,” exclaimed Yüan Yang laughingly, “to eat what\nwas intended for us!”",
        "“Don’t be so captious with me!” smiled lady Feng. “Are you aware that\nyour master Secundus, Mr. Lien, has taken such a violent fancy to you\nthat he means to speak to our old lady to let you be his secondary\nwife!”",
        "Yüan Yang blushed crimson. “Ts’ui!” she shouted. “Are these really words\nto issue from the mouth of a lady! But if I don’t daub your face all\nover with my filthy hands, I won’t feel happy!”",
        "Saying this, she rushed up to her. She was about to besmear her face,\nwhen lady Feng pleaded: “My dear child, do let me off this time!”",
        "“Lo, that girl Yüan,” laughed Hu Po, “wishes to smear her, and that\nhussey P’ing still spares her! Look here, she has scarcely had two\ncrabs, and she has drunk a whole saucerful of vinegar!”",
        "P’ing Erh was holding a crab full of yellow meat, which she was in the\nact of cleaning. As soon therefore as she heard this taunt, she came,\ncrab in hand, to spatter Hu Po’s face, as she laughingly reviled her.\n\"I’ll take you minx with that cajoling tongue of yours” she cried,\n\"and....”",
        "But, Hu Po, while also indulging in laughter, drew aside; so P’ing Erh\nbeat the air, and fell forward, daubing, by a strange coincidence, the\ncheek of lady Feng. Lady Feng was at the moment having a little\ngood-humoured raillery with Yüan Yang, and was taken so much off her\nguard, that she was quite startled out of her senses. “Ai-yah!” she\nejaculated. The bystanders found it difficult to keep their countenance,\nand, with one voice, they exploded into a boisterous fit of laughter.\nLady Feng as well could not help feeling amused, and smilingly she\nupbraided her. “You stupid wench!” she said; “Have you by gorging lost\nyour eyesight that you recklessly smudge your mistress’ face?”",
        "P’ing Erh hastily crossed over and wiped her face for her, and then went\nin person to fetch some water.",
        "“O-mi-to-fu,” ejaculated Yüan Yang, “this is a distinct retribution!”",
        "Dowager lady Chia, though seated on the other side, overheard their\nshouts, and she consecutively made inquiries as to what they had seen to\ntickled their fancy so. “Tell us,” (she urged), “what it is so that we\ntoo should have a laugh.”",
        "“Our lady Secunda,” Yüan Yang and the other maids forthwith laughingly\ncried, “came to steal our crabs and eat them, and P’ing Erh got angry\nand daubed her mistress’ face all over with yellow meat. So our mistress\nand that slave-girl are now having a scuffle over it.”",
        "This report filled dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang and the other inmates\nwith them with much merriment. “Do have pity on her,” dowager lady Chia\nlaughed, “and let her have some of those small legs and entrails to eat,\nand have done!”",
        "Yuan Yang and her companions assented, much amused. “Mistress Secunda,\"\nthey shouted in a loud tone of voice, “you’re at liberty to eat this\nwhole tableful of legs!”",
        "But having washed her face clean, lady Feng approached old lady Chia and\nthe other guests and waited upon them for a time, while they partook of\nrefreshments.",
        "Tai-yü did not, with her weak physique, venture to overload her stomach,\nso partaking of a little meat from the claws, she left the table.\nPresently, however, dowager lady Chia too abandoned all idea of having\nanything more to eat. The company therefore quitted the banquet; and,\nwhen they had rinsed their hands, some admired the flowers, some played\nwith the water, others looked at the fish.",
        "After a short stroll, Madame Wang turned round and remarked to old lady\nChia: “There’s plenty of wind here. Besides, you’ve just had crabs; so\nit would be prudent for you, venerable senior, to return home and rest.\nAnd if you feel in the humour, we can come again for a turn to-morrow.”",
        "“Quite true!” acquiesced dowager lady Chia, in reply to this suggestion.\n\"I was afraid that if I left, now that you’re all in exuberant spirits,\nI mightn’t again be spoiling your fun, (so I didn’t budge). But as the\nidea originates from yourselves do go as you please, (while I retire).\nBut,” she said to Hsiang-yün, “don’t allow your cousin Secundus, Pao-yü,\nand your cousin Lin to have too much to eat.” Then when Hsiang-yün had\nsignified her obedience, “You two girls,” continuing, she recommended\nHsiang-yün and Pao-ch’ai, “must not also have more than is good for you.\nThose things are, it’s true, luscious, but they’re not very wholesome;\nand if you eat immoderately of them, why, you’ll get stomachaches.”",
        "Both girls promised with alacrity to be careful; and, having escorted\nher beyond the confines of the garden, they retraced their steps and\nordered the servants to clear the remnants of the banquet and to lay out\na new supply of refreshments.",
        "“There’s no use of any regular spread out!” Pao-yü interposed. “When you\nare about to write verses, that big round table can be put in the centre\nand the wines and eatables laid on it. Neither will there be any need to\nceremoniously have any fixed seats. Let those who may want anything to\neat, go up to it and take what they like; and if we seat ourselves,\nscattered all over the place, won’t it be far more convenient for us?”",
        "“Your idea is excellent!” Pao-ch’ai answered.",
        "“This is all very well,” Hsiang-yün observed, “but there are others to\nbe studied besides ourselves!”",
        "Issuing consequently further directions for another table to be laid,\nand picking out some hot crabs, she asked Hsi Jen, Tzu Chüan, Ssu Ch’i,\nShih Shu, Ju Hua, Ying Erh, Ts’ui Mo and the other girls to sit together\nand form a party. Then having a couple of flowered rugs spread under the\nolea trees on the hills, she bade the matrons on duty, the waiting-maids\nand other servants to likewise make themselves comfortable and to eat\nand drink at their pleasure until they were wanted, when they could come\nand answer the calls.",
        "Hsiang-yün next fetched the themes for the verses and pinned them with a\nneedle on the wall. “They’re full of originality,” one and all exclaimed\nafter perusal, “we fear we couldn’t write anything on them.”",
        "Hsiang-yün then went onto explain to them the reasons that had prompted\nher not to determine upon any particular rhymes.",
        "“Yes, quite right!” put in Pao-yü. “I myself don’t fancy hard and fast\nrhymes!”",
        "But Lin Tai-yü, being unable to stand much wine and to take any crabs,\ntold, on her own account, a servant to fetch an embroidered cushion;\nand, seating herself in such a way as to lean against the railing, she\ntook up a fishing-rod and began to fish. Pao-ch’ai played for a time\nwith a twig of olea she held in her hand, then resting on the\nwindow-sill, she plucked the petals, and threw them into the water,\nattracting the fish, which went by, to rise to the surface and nibble at\nthem. Hsiang-yün, after a few moments of abstraction, urged Hsi Jen and\nthe other girls to help themselves to anything they wanted, and beckoned\nto the servants, seated at the foot of the hill, to eat to their heart’s\ncontent. Tan Ch’un, in company with Li Wan and Hsi Ch’un, stood\nmeanwhile under the shade of the weeping willows, and looked at the\nwidgeons and egrets. Ying Ch’un, on the other hand, was all alone under\nthe shade of some trees, threading double jasmine flowers, with a needle\nspecially adapted for the purpose. Pao-yü too watched Tai-yü fishing for\na while. At one time he leant next to Pao-ch’ai and cracked a few jokes\nwith her. And at another, he drank, when he noticed Hsi Jen feasting on\ncrabs with her companions, a few mouthfuls of wine to keep her company.\nAt this, Hsi Jen cleaned the meat out of a shell, and gave it to him to\neat.",
        "Tai-yü then put down the fishing-rod, and, approaching the seats, she\nlaid hold of a small black tankard, ornamented with silver plum flowers,\nand selected a tiny cup, made of transparent stone, red like a begonia,\nand in the shape of a banana leaf. A servant-girl observed her\nmovements, and, concluding that she felt inclined to have a drink, she\ndrew near with hurried step to pour some wine for her.",
        "“You girls had better go on eating,” Tai-yü remonstrated, “and let me\nhelp myself; there’ll be some fun in it then!”",
        "So speaking, she filled for herself a cup half full; but discovering\nthat it was yellow wine, “I’ve eaten only a little bit of crab,” she\nsaid, “and yet I feel my mouth slightly sore; so what would do for me\nnow is a mouthful of very hot distilled spirit.”",
        "Pao-yü hastened to take up her remark. “There’s some distilled spirit,\"\nhe chimed in. “Take some of that wine,” he there and then shouted out to\na servant, “scented with acacia flowers, and warm a tankard of it.”",
        "When however it was brought Tai-yü simply took a sip and put it down\nagain.",
        "Pao-ch’ai too then came forward, and picked up a double cup; but, after\ndrinking a mouthful of it, she lay it aside, and, moistening her pen,\nshe walked up to the wall, and marked off the first theme: “longing for\nchrysanthemums,” below which she appended a character “Heng.”",
        "“My dear cousin,” promptly remarked Pao-yü. “I’ve already got four lines\nof the second theme so let me write on it!”",
        "“I managed, after ever so much difficulty, to put a stanza together,\"\nPao-ch’ai smiled, “and are you now in such a hurry to deprive me of it?”",

        "At the close of their perusal, they with one voice, explained that this\nwas a first-rate song on crab-eating; that minor themes of this kind\nshould really conceal lofty thoughts, before they could be held to be of\nany great merit, and that the only thing was that it chaffed people\nrather too virulently.",

        "“There are plenty!” Hsiang-yün rejoined; and directing, with alacrity, a\nservant to fetch a present box, she put in it ten of the largest crabs.",

        "“I insist upon your sitting down,” Li Wan laughingly exclaimed, and as\nshe kept pulling her about, and forcing her to sit next to her, she\nfilled a cup of wine and put it to her lips. P’ing Erh hastily swallowed\na sip and endeavoured immediately to beat a retreat.",
        "“I won’t let you go,” shouted Li Wan. “It’s so evident that you’re only\ngot that woman Feng in your thoughts as you don’t listen to any of my\nwords!”",

        "“What a pity it is,” interposed Li Wan, caressing her, “that a girl with\nsuch good looks as you should have so ordinary a fortune as to simply\nfall into that room as a menial! But wouldn’t any one, who is not\nacquainted with actual facts, take you for a lady and a mistress?”",

        "“It’s a key,” P’ing Erh answered.",
        "“What fine things have you got that the fear lest people should take it\naway, prompts you to carry this about you?

        "“This is really quite true,” Pao-ch’ai laughed. “Whenever we’ve got\nnothing to do, and we talk matters over, (we’re quite unanimous) that\nnot one in a hundred could be picked out to equal you girls in here. The\nbeauty is that each one of you possesses her own good qualities!”",
        "“In every thing, whether large or small, a heavenly principle rules\nalike,” Li Wan explained. “Were there, for instance, no Yüan Yang in our\nvenerable senior’s apartments, how would it ever do? Commencing with\nMadame Wang herself, who is it who could muster sufficient courage to\nexpostulate with the old lady? Yet she plainly has the pluck to put in\nher remonstrances with her; and, as it happens, our worthy ancestor\nlends a patient ear to only what she says and no one else. None of the\nothers can remember what our old senior has in the way of clothes and\nhead-ornaments, but she can remember everything; and, were she not there\nto look after things, there is no knowing how many would not be swindled\naway. That child besides is so straightforward at heart, that, despite\nall this, she often puts in a good word for others, and doesn’t rely\nupon her influence to look down disdainfully upon any one!”",
        "“It was only yesterday,” Hsi Ch’un observed with a smile, “that our dear\nancestor said that she was ever so much better than the whole lot of\nus!”",
        "“She’s certainly splendid!” P’ing Erh ventured. “How could we rise up to\nher standard?”",
        "“Ts’ai Hsia,” Pao-yü put in, “who is in mother’s rooms, is a good sort\nof girl!”",
        "“Of course she is!” T’an Ch’un assented. “But she’s good enough as far\nas external appearances go, but inwardly she’s a sly one! Madame Wang is\njust like a joss; she does not give her mind to any sort of business;\nbut this girl is up to everything; and it is she who in all manner of\nthings reminds her mistress what there is to be done. She even knows\neverything, whether large or small, connected with Mr. Chia Cheng’s\nstaying at home or going out of doors; and when at any time Madame Wang\nforgets, she, from behind the scenes, prompts her how to act.”",
        "“Well, never mind about her!” Li Wan suggested. “But were,” she pursued,\npointing at Pao-yü, “no Hsi Jen in this young gentleman’s quarters, just\nyou imagine what a pitch things would reach! That vixen Feng may truly\nresemble the prince Pa of the Ch’u kingdom; and she may have two arms\nstrong enough to raise a tripod weighing a thousand catties, but had she\nnot this maid (P’ing Erh), would she be able to accomplish everything so\nthoroughly?”",
        "“In days gone by,” P’ing Erh interposed, “four servant-girls came along\nwith her, but what with those who’ve died and those who’ve gone, only I\nremain like a solitary spirit.”",
        "“You’re, after all, the fortunate one!” Li Wan retorted, “but our hussey\nFeng too is lucky in having you! Had I not also once, just remember, two\ngirls, when your senior master Chu was alive? Am I not, you’ve seen for\nyourselves, a person to bear with people? But in such a surly frame of\nmind did I find them both day after day that, as soon as your senior\nmaster departed this life, I availed myself of their youth (to give them\nin marriage) and to pack both of them out of my place. But had either of\nthem been good for anything and worthy to be kept, I would, in fact,\nhave now had some one to give me a helping hand!”",
        "As she spoke, the very balls of her eyes suddenly became quite red.",
        "“Why need you again distress your mind?” they with one voice, exclaimed.\n\"Isn’t it better that we should break up?”",
        "While conversing, they rinsed their hands; and, when they had agreed to\ngo in a company to dowager lady Chia’s and Madame Wang’s and inquire\nafter their health, the matrons and servant-maids swept the pavilion and\ncollected and washed the cups and saucers.",
        "Hsi Jen proceeded on her way along with P’ing Erh. “Come into my room,\"\nsaid Hsi Jen to P’ing Erh, “and sit down and have another cup of tea.”",
        "“I won’t have any tea just now,” P’ing Erh answered. “I’ll come some\nother time.”",
        "So saying, she was about to go off when Hsi Jen called out to her and\nstopped her.",
        "“This month’s allowances,” she asked, “haven’t yet been issued, not even\nto our old mistress and Madame Wang; why is it?”",
        "Upon catching this inquiry, P’ing Erh hastily retraced her steps and\ndrew near Hsi Jen. After looking about to see that no one was in the\nneighbourhood, she rejoined in a low tone of voice, “Drop these\nquestions at once! They’re sure, anyhow, to be issued in a couple of\ndays.”",
        "“Why is it,” smiled Hsi Jen, “that this gives you such a start?”",
        "“This month’s allowances,” P’ing Erh explained to her in a whisper,\n\"have long ago been obtained in advance by our mistress Secunda and\ngiven to people for their own purposes; and it’s when the interest has\nbeen brought from here and there that the various sums will be lumped\ntogether and payment be effected. I confide this to you, but, mind, you\nmustn’t go and tell any other person about it.”",
        "“Is it likely that she hasn’t yet enough money for her own\nrequirements?” Hsi Jen smiled. “Or is it that she’s still not satisfied?\nAnd what’s the use of her still going on bothering herself in this way?”",
        "“Isn’t it so!” laughed P’ing Erh. “From just handling the funds for this\nparticular item, she has, during these few years, so manipulated them as\nto turn up several hundreds of taels profit out of them. Nor does she\nspend that monthly allowance of hers for public expenses. But the moment\nshe accumulates anything like eight or ten taels odd, she gives them out\ntoo. Thus the interest on her own money alone comes up to nearly a\nthousand taels a year.”",
        "“You and your mistress take our money,” Hsi Jen observed laughingly,\n\"and get interest on it; fooling us as if we were no better than\nidiots.”",
        "“Here you are again with your uncharitable words!” P’ing Erh\nremonstrated. “Can it be that you haven’t yet enough to meet your own\nexpenses with?”",
        "“I am, it’s true, not short of money,” Hsi Jen replied, “as I have\nnowhere to go and spend it; but the thing is that I’m making provision\nfor that fellow of ours, (Pao-yü).”",
        "“If you ever find yourself in any great straits and need money,” P’ing\nErh resumed, “you’re at liberty to take first those few taels I’ve got\nover there to suit your own convenience with, and by and bye I can\nreduce them from what is due to you and we’ll be square.”",
        "“I’m not in need of any just now,” retorted Hsi Jen. “But should I not\nhave enough, when I want some, I’ll send some one to fetch them, and\nfinish.”",
        "P’ing Erh promised that she would let her have the money at any time she\nsent for it, and, and taking the shortest cut, she issued out of the\ngarden gate. Here she encountered a servant despatched from the other\nside by lady Feng. She came in search of P’ing Erh. “Our lady,” she\nsaid, “has something for you to do, and is waiting for you.”",
        "“What’s up that it’s so pressing?” P’ing Erh inquired. “Our senior\nmistress detained me by force to have a chat, so I couldn’t manage to\nget away. But here she time after time sends people after me in this\nmanner!”",
        "“Whether you go or not is your own look out,” the maid replied. “It\nisn’t worth your while getting angry with me! If you dare, go and tell\nthese things to our mistress!”",
        "P’ing Erh spat at her contemptuously, and rushed back in anxious haste.\nShe discovered, however, that lady Feng was not at home. But\nunexpectedly she perceived that the old goody Liu, who had paid them a\nvisit on a previous occasion for the purpose of obtaining pecuniary\nassistance, had come again with Pan Erh, and was seated in the opposite\nroom, along with Chang Ts’ai’s wife and Chou Jui’s wife, who kept her\ncompany. But two or three servant-maids were inside as well emptying on\nthe floor bags containing dates, squash and various wild greens.",
        "As soon as they saw her appear in the room, they promptly stood up in a\nbody. Old goody Liu had, on her last visit, learnt what P’ing Erh’s\nstatus in the establishment was, so vehemently jumping down, she\nenquired, “Miss, how do you do? All at home,” she pursued, “send you\ntheir compliments. I meant to have come earlier and paid my respects to\nmy lady and to look you up, miss; but we’ve been very busy on the farm.\nWe managed this year to reap, after great labour, a few more piculs of\ngrain than usual. But melons, fruits and vegetables have also been\nplentiful. These things, you see here, are what we picked during the\nfirst crop; and as we didn’t presume to sell them, we kept the best to\npresent to our lady and the young ladies to taste. The young ladies\nmust, of course, be surfeited with all the delicacies and fine things\nthey daily get, but by having some of our wild greens to eat, they will\nshow some regard for our poor attention.”",
        "“Many thanks for all the trouble you have taken!” Ping Erh eagerly\nrejoined. Then pressing her to resume her place, she sat down herself;\nand, urging Mrs. Chang and Mrs. Chou to take their seats, she bade a\nyoung waiting-maid go and serve the tea.",
        "“There’s a joyous air about your face to-day, Miss, and your eye-balls\nare all red,” the wife of Chou Jui and the wife of Chang Ts’ai thereupon\nsmilingly ventured.",
        "“Naturally!” P’ing Erh laughed. “I generally don’t take any wine, but\nour senior mistress, and our young ladies caught hold of me and insisted\nupon pouring it down my throat. I had no alternative therefore but to\nswallow two cups full; so my face at once flushed crimson.”",
        "“I have a longing for wine,” Chang Ts’ai’s wife smiled; “but there’s no\none to offer me any. But when any one by and by invites you, Miss, do\ntake me along with you!”",
        "At these words, one and all burst out laughing.",
        "“Early this morning,” Chou Jui’s wife interposed, “I caught a glimpse of\nthose crabs. Only two or three of them would weigh a catty; so in those\ntwo or three huge hampers, there must have been, I presume, seventy to\neighty catties!”",
        "“If some were intended for those above as well as for those below;” Chou\nJui’s wife added, “they couldn’t, nevertheless, I fear, have been\nenough.”",
        "“How could every one have had any?” P’ing Erh observed. “Those simply\nwith any name may have tasted a couple of them; but, as for the rest,\nsome may have touched them with the tips of their hands, but many may\neven not have done as much.”",
        "“Crabs of this kind!” put in old goody Liu, “cost this year five\ncandareens a catty; ten catties for five mace; five times five make two\ntaels five, and three times five make fifteen; and adding what was\nwanted for wines and eatables, the total must have come to something\nover twenty taels. O-mi-to-fu! why, this heap of money is ample for us\ncountry-people to live on through a whole year!”",
        "“I expect you have seen our lady?” P’ing Erh then asked.",
        "“Yes, I have seen her,” assented old goody Liu. “She bade us wait.” As\nshe spoke, she again looked out of the window to see what the time of\nthe day could be. “It’s getting quite late,” she afterwards proceeded.\n\"We must be going, or else we mayn’t be in time to get out of the city\ngates; and then we’ll be in a nice fix.”",
        "“Quite right,” Chou Jui’s wife observed. “I’ll go and see what she’s up\nto for you.”",
        "With these words, she straightway left the room. After a long absence,\nshe returned. “Good fortune has, indeed, descended upon you, old dame!\"\nshe smiled. “Why, you’ve won the consideration of those two ladies!”",
        "“What about it?” laughingly inquired P’ing Erh and the others.",
        "“Lady Secunda,” Chou Jui’s wife explained with a smile, “was with our\nvenerable lady, so I gently whispered to her: ’old goody Liu wishes to\ngo home; it’s getting late and she fears she mightn’t be in time to go\nout of the gates!’ ’It’s such a long way off!’ Our lady Secunda\nrejoined, ’and she had all the trouble and fatigue of carrying that load\nof things; so if it’s too late, why, let her spend the night here and\nstart on the morrow!’ Now isn’t this having enlisted our mistress’\nsympathies? But not to speak of this! Our old lady also happened to\noverhear what we said, and she inquired: ’who is old goody Liu?’ Our\nlady Secunda forthwith told her all. ’I was just longing,’ her venerable\nladyship pursued, ’for some one well up in years to have a chat with;\nask her in, and let me see her!’ So isn’t this coming in for\nconsideration, when least unexpected?”",
        "So speaking, she went on to urge old goody Liu to get down and betake\nherself to the front.",
        "“With a figure like this of mine,” old goody Liu demurred, “how could I\nvery well appear before her? My dear sister-in-law, do tell her that\nI’ve gone!”",
        "“Get on! Be quick!” P’ing Erh speedily cried. “What does it matter? Our\nold lady has the highest regard for old people and the greatest pity for\nthe needy! She’s not one you could compare with those haughty and\noverbearing people! But I fancy you’re a little too timid, so I’ll\naccompany you as far as there, along with Mrs. Chou.”",
        "While tendering her services, she and Chou Jui’s wife led off old goody\nLiu and crossed over to dowager lady Chia’s apartments on this side of\nthe mansion. The boy-servants on duty at the second gate stood up when\nthey saw P’ing Erh approach. But two of them also ran up to her, and,\nkeeping close to her heels: “Miss!” they shouted out. “Miss!”",
        "“What have you again got to say?” P’ing Erh asked.",
        "“It’s pretty late just now,” one of the boys smilingly remarked; “and\nmother is ill and wants me to go and call the doctor, so I would, dear\nMiss, like to have half a day’s leave; may I?”",
        "“Your doings are really fine!” P’ing Erh exclaimed. “You’ve agreed among\nyourselves that each day one of you should apply for furlough; but\ninstead of speaking to your lady, you come and bother me! The other day\nthat Chu Erh went, Mr. Secundus happened not to want him, so I assented,\nthough I also added that I was doing it as a favour; but here you too\ncome to-day!”",
        "“It’s quite true that his mother is sick,” Chou Jui’s wife interceded;\n\"so, Miss, do say yes to him also, and let him go!”",
        "“Be back as soon as it dawns to-morrow!” P’ing Erh enjoined. “Wait, I’ve\ngot something for you to do, for you’ll again sleep away, and only turn\nup after the sun has blazed away on your buttocks. As you go now, give a\nmessage to Wang Erh! Tell him that our lady bade you warn him that if he\ndoes not hand over the balance of the interest due by to-morrow, she\nwon’t have anything to do with him. So he’d better let her have it to\nmeet her requirements and finish.”",
        "The servant-lad felt in high glee and exuberant spirits. Expressing his\nobedience, he walked off.",
        "P’ing Erh and her companions repaired then to old lady Chia’s\napartments. Here the various young ladies from the Garden of Broad Vista\nwere at the time assembled paying their respects to their grandmother.\nAs soon as old goody Liu put her foot inside, she saw the room thronged\nwith girls (as seductive) as twigs of flowers waving to and fro, and so\nrichly dressed, as to look enveloped in pearls, and encircled with\nking-fisher ornaments. But she could not make out who they all were. Her\ngaze was, however, attracted by an old dame, reclining alone on a divan.\nBehind her sat a girl, a regular beauty, clothed in gauze, engaged in\npatting her legs. Lady Feng was on her feet in the act of cracking some\njoke.",
        "Old goody Liu readily concluded that it must be dowager lady Chia, so\npromptly pressing forward, she put on a forced smile and made several\ncurtseys. “My obeisance to you, star of longevity!” she said.",
        "Old lady Chia hastened, on her part, to bow and to inquire after her\nhealth. Then she asked Chou Jui’s wife to bring a chair over for her to\ntake a seat. But Pan Erh was still so very shy that he did not know how\nto make his obeisance.",
        "“Venerable relative,” dowager lady Chia asked, “how old are you this\nyear?”",
        "Old goody Liu immediately rose to her feet. “I’m seventy-five this\nyear,” she rejoined.",
        "“So old and yet so hardy!” Old lady Chia remarked, addressing herself to\nthe party. “Why she’s older than myself by several years! When I reach\nthat age, I wonder whether I shall be able to move!”",
        "“We people have,” old goody Liu smilingly resumed, “to put up, from the\nmoment we come into the world, with ever so many hardships; while your\nvenerable ladyship enjoys, from your birth, every kind of blessing! Were\nwe also like this, there’d be no one to carry on that farming work.”",
        "“Are your eyes and teeth still good?” Dowager lady Chia went on to\ninquire.",
        "“They’re both still all right,” old goody Liu replied. “The left molars,\nhowever, have got rather shaky this year.”",
        "“As for me, I’m quite an old fossil,” dowager lady Chia observed. “I’m\nno good whatever. My eyesight is dim; my ears are deaf, my memory is\ngone. I can’t even recollect any of you, old family connections. When\ntherefore any of our relations come on a visit, I don’t see them for\nfear lest I should be ridiculed. All I can manage to eat are a few\nmouthfuls of anything tender enough for my teeth; and I can just dose a\nbit or, when I feel in low spirits, I distract myself a little with\nthese grandsons and grand-daughters of mine; that’s all I’m good for.”",
        "“This is indeed your venerable ladyship’s good fortune!” old goody Liu\nsmiled. “We couldn’t enjoy anything of the kind, much though we may long\nfor it.”",
        "“What good fortune!” dowager lady Chia exclaimed. “I’m a useless old\nthing, no more.”",
        "This remark made every one explode into laughter.",
        "Dowager lady Chia also laughed. “I heard our lady Feng say a little\nwhile back,” she added, “that you had brought a lot of squash and\nvegetables, and I told her to put them by at once. I had just been\ncraving to have newly-grown melons and vegetables; but those one buys\noutside are not as luscious as those produced in your farms.”",
        "“This is the rustic notion,” old goody Liu laughed, “to entirely subsist\non fresh things! Yet, we long to have fish and meat for our fare, but we\ncan’t afford it.”",
        "“I’ve found a relative in you to-day,” dowager lady Chia said, “so you\nshouldn’t go empty-handed! If you don’t despise this place as too mean,\ndo stay a day or two before you start! We’ve also got a garden here; and\nthis garden produces fruits too; you can taste some of them to-morrow\nand take a few along with you home, in order to make it look like a\nvisit to relatives.”",
        "When lady Feng saw how delighted old lady Chia was with the prospects of\nthe old dame’s stay, she too lost no time in doing all she could to\ninduce her to remain. “Our place here,” she urged, “isn’t, it’s true, as\nspacious as your threshing-floor; but as we’ve got two vacant rooms,\nyou’d better put up in them for a couple of days, and choose some of\nyour village news and old stories and recount them to our worthy\nsenior.”",
        "“Now you, vixen Feng,” smiled dowager lady Chia, “don’t raise a laugh at\nher expense! She’s only a country woman; and will an old dame like her\nstand any chaff from you?”",
        "While remonstrating with her, she bade a servant go, before attending to\nanything else, and pluck a few fruits. These she handed to Pan Erh to\neat. But Pan Erh did not venture to touch them, conscious as he was of\nthe presence of such a number of bystanders. So old lady Chia gave\norders that a few cash should be given him, and then directed the pages\nto take him outside to play.",
        "After sipping a cup of tea, old goody Liu began to relate, for the\nbenefit of dowager lady Chia, a few of the occurrences she had seen or\nheard of in the country. These had the effect of putting old lady Chia\nin a more exuberant frame of mind. But in the midst of her narration, a\nservant, at lady Feng’s instance, asked goody Liu to go and have her\nevening meal. Dowager lady Chia then picked out, as well, several kinds\nof eatables from her own repast, and charged some one to take them to\ngoody Liu to feast on.",
        "But the consciousness that the old dame had taken her senior’s fancy\ninduced lady Feng to send her back again as soon as she had taken some\nrefreshments. On her arrival, Yüan Yang hastily deputed a matron to take\ngoody Liu to have a bath. She herself then went and selected two pieces\nof ordinary clothes, and these she entrusted to a servant to hand to the\nold dame to change. Goody Liu had hitherto not set eyes upon any such\ngrand things, so with eagerness she effected the necessary alterations\nin her costume. This over, she made her appearance outside, and, sitting\nin front of the divan occupied by dowager lady Chia, she went on to\nnarrate as many stories as she could recall to mind. Pao-yü and his\ncousins too were, at the time, assembled in the room, and as they had\nnever before heard anything the like of what she said, they, of course,\nthought her tales more full of zest than those related by itinerant\nblind story-tellers.",
        "Old goody Liu was, albeit a rustic person, gifted by nature with a good\ndeal of discrimination. She was besides advanced in years; and had gone\nthrough many experiences in her lifetime, so when she, in the first\nplace, saw how extremely delighted old lady Chia was with her, and, in\nthe second, how eager the whole crowd of young lads and lasses were to\nlisten to what fell from her mouth, she even invented, when she found\nher own stock exhausted, a good many yarns to recount to them.",
        "“What with all the sowing we have to do in our fields and the vegetables\nwe have to plant,” she consequently proceeded, “have we ever in our\nvillage any leisure to sit with lazy hands from year to year and day to\nday; no matter whether it’s spring, summer, autumn or winter, whether it\nblows or whether it rains? Yea, day after day all that we can do is to\nturn the bare road into a kind of pavilion to rest and cool ourselves\non! But what strange things don’t we see! Last winter, for instance,\nsnow fell for several consecutive days, and it piled up on the ground\nthree or four feet deep. One day, I got up early, but I hadn’t as yet\ngone out of the door of our house when I heard outside the noise of\nfirewood (being moved). I fancied that some one must have come to steal\nit, so I crept up to a hole in the window; but, lo, I discovered that it\nwas no one from our own village.”",
        "“It must have been,” interposed dowager lady Chia, “some wayfarers, who\nbeing smitten with the cold, took some of the firewood, they saw ready\nat hand, to go and make a fire and warm themselves with! That’s highly\nprobable!”",
        "“It was no wayfarers at all,” old goody Liu retorted smiling, “and\nthat’s what makes the story so strange. Who do you think it was,\nvenerable star of longevity? It was really a most handsome girl of\nseventeen or eighteen, whose hair was combed as smooth as if oil had\nbeen poured over it. She was dressed in a deep red jacket, a white silk\npetticoat....”",
        "When she reached this part of her narrative, suddenly became audible the\nvoices of people bawling outside. “It’s nothing much,” they shouted,\n\"don’t frighten our old mistress!” Dowager lady Chia and the other\ninmates caught, however, their cries and hurriedly inquired what had\nhappened. A servant-maid explained in reply that a fire had broken out\nin the stables in the southern court, but that there was no danger, as\nthe flames had been suppressed.",
        "Their old grandmother was a person with very little nerve. The moment,\ntherefore, the report fell on her car, she jumped up with all despatch,\nand leaning on one of the family, she rushed on to the verandah to\nascertain the state of things. At the sight of the still brilliant\nlight, shed by the flames, on the south east part of the compound, old\nlady Chia was plunged in consternation, and invoking Buddha, she went on\nto shout to the servants to go and burn incense before the god of fire.",
        "Madame Wang and the rest of the members of the household lost no time in\ncrossing over in a body to see how she was getting on. “The fire has\nbeen already extinguished,” they too assured her, “please, dear\nancestor, repair into your rooms!”",
        "But it was only after old lady Chia had seen the light of the flames\nentirely subside that she at length led the whole company indoors. “What\nwas that girl up to, taking the firewood in that heavy fall of snow?\"\nPao-yü thereupon vehemently inquired of goody Liu. “What, if she had got\nfrostbitten and fallen ill?”",
        "“It was the reference made recently to the firewood that was being\nabstracted,” his grandmother Chia said, “that brought about this fire;\nand do you still go on asking more about it? Leave this story alone, and\ntell us something else!”",
        "Hearing this reminder, Pao-yü felt constrained to drop the subject, much\nagainst his wishes, and old goody Liu forthwith thought of something\nelse to tell them.",
        "“In our village,” she resumed, “and on the eastern side of our\nfarmstead, there lives an old dame, whose age is this year, over ninety.\nShe goes in daily for fasting, and worshipping Buddha. Who’d have\nthought it, she so moved the pity of the goddess of mercy that she gave\nher this message in a dream: ’It was at one time ordained that you\nshould have no posterity, but as you have proved so devout, I have now\nmemorialised the Pearly Emperor to grant you a grandson!’ The fact is,\nthis old dame had one son. This son had had too an only son; but he died\nafter they had with great difficulty managed to rear him to the age of\nseventeen or eighteen. And what tears didn’t they shed for him! But, in\ncourse of time, another son was actually born to him. He is this year\njust thirteen or fourteen, resembles a very ball of flower, (so plump is\nhe), and is clever and sharp to an exceptional degree! So this is indeed\na clear proof that those spirits and gods do exist!”",
        "This long tirade proved to be in harmony with dowager lady Chia’s and\nMadame Wang’s secret convictions on the subject. Even Madame Wang\ntherefore listened to every word with all profound attention. Pao-yü,\nhowever, was so pre-occupied with the story about the stolen firewood\nthat he fell in a brown study and gave way to conjectures.\n\r\n“Yesterday,” T’an Ch’un at this point remarked, “We put cousin Shih to a\nlot of trouble and inconvenience, so, when we get back, we must consult\nabout convening a meeting, and, while returning her entertainment, we\ncan also invite our venerable ancestor to come and admire the\nchrysanthemums; what do you think of this?”",
        "“Our worthy senior,” smiled Pao-yü, “has intimated that she means to\ngive a banquet to return cousin Shih’s hospitality, and to ask us to do\nthe honours. Let’s wait therefore until we partake of grandmother’s\ncollation, before we issue our own invitations; there will be ample time\nthen to do so.”",
        "“The later it gets, the cooler the weather becomes,” T’an Ch’un\nobserved, “and our dear senior is not likely to enjoy herself.”",
        "“Grandmother,” added Pao-yü, “is also fond of rain and snow, so wouldn’t\nit be as well to wait until the first fall, and then ask her to come and\nlook at the snow. This will be better, won’t it? And were we to recite\nour verses with snow about us, it will be ever so much more fun!”",
        "“To hum verses in the snow,” Lin Tai-yü speedily demurred with a smile,\n\"won’t, in my idea, be half as nice as building up a heap of firewood\nand then stealing it, with the flakes playing about us. This will be by\nfar more enjoyable!”",
        "This proposal made Pao-ch’ai and the others laugh. Pao-yü cast a glance\nat her but made no reply.",
        "But, in a short time, the company broke up. Pao-yü eventually gave old\ngoody Liu a tug on the sly and plied her with minute questions as to who\nthe girl was. The old dame was placed under the necessity of fabricating\nsomething for his benefit. “The truth is,” she said, “that there stands\non the north bank of the ditch in our village a small ancestral hall, in\nwhich offerings are made, but not to spirits or gods. There was in\nformer days some official or other...”",
        "“While speaking, she went on to try and recollect his name and surname.",
        "“No matter about names or surnames!” Pao-yü expostulated. “There’s no\nneed for you to recall them to memory! Just mention the facts; they’ll\nbe enough.”",
        "“This official,” old goody Liu resumed, “had no son. His offspring\nconsisted of one young daughter, who went under the name of Jo Yü, (like\nJade). She could read and write, and was doated upon by this official\nand his consort, just as if she were a precious jewel. But,\nunfortunately, when this young lady, Jo Yü, grew up to be seventeen, she\ncontracted some disease and died.”",
        "When these words fell on Pao-yü’s ears, he stamped his foot and heaved a\nsigh. “What happened after that?” he then asked.",
        "Old goody Liu pursued her story.",
        "“So incessantly,” she continued, “did this official and his consort\nthink of their child that they raised this ancestral hall, erected a\nclay image of their young daughter Jo Yü in it, and appointed some one\nto burn incense and trim the fires. But so many days and years have now\nelapsed that the people themselves are no more alive, the temple is in\ndecay, and the image itself is become a spirit.”",
        "“It hasn’t become a spirit,” remonstrated Pao-yü with vehemence. “Human\nbeings of this kind may, the rule is, die, yet they are not dead.”",
        "“O-mi-to-fu!” ejaculated old goody Liu; “is it really so! Had you, sir,\nnot enlightened us, we would have remained under the impression that she\nhad become a spirit! But she repeatedly transforms herself into a human\nbeing, and there she roams about in every village, farmstead, inn and\nroadside. And the one I mentioned just now as having taken the firewood\nis that very girl! The villagers in our place are still consulting with\nthe idea of breaking this clay image and razing the temple to the\nground.”",
        "“Be quick and dissuade them!” eagerly exclaimed Pao-yü. “Were they to\nraze the temple to the ground, their crime won’t be small.”",
        "“It’s lucky that you told me, Sir,” old goody Liu added. “When I get\nback to-morrow, I’ll make them relinquish the idea and finish!”",
        "“Our venerable senior and my mother,” Pao-yü pursued, “are both\ncharitable persons. In fact, all the inmates of our family, whether old\nor young, do, in like manner, delight in good deeds, and take pleasure\nin distributing alms. Their greatest relish is to repair temples, and to\nput up images to the spirits; so to-morrow, I’ll make a subscription and\ncollect a few donations for you, and you can then act as incense-burner.\nWhen sufficient money has been raised, this fane can be repaired, and\nanother clay image put up; and month by month I’ll give you incense and\nfire money to enable you to burn joss-sticks; won’t this be A good thing\nfor you?”",
        "“In that case,” old goody Liu rejoined, “I shall, thanks to that young\nlady’s good fortune, have also a few cash to spend.”",
        "Pao-yü thereupon likewise wanted to know what the name of the place was,\nthe name of the village, how far it was there and back, and whereabout\nthe temple was situated.",
        "Old goody Liu replied to his questions, by telling him every idle\nthought that came first to her lips. Pao-yü, however, credited the\ninformation she gave him and, on his return to his rooms, he exercised,\nthe whole night, his mind with building castles in the air.",
        "On the morrow, as soon as daylight dawned, he speedily stepped out of\nhis room, and, handing Pei Ming several hundreds of cash, he bade him\nproceed first in the direction and to the place specified by old goody\nLiu, and clearly ascertain every detail, so as to enable him, on his\nreturn from his errand, to arrive at a suitable decision to carry out\nhis purpose. After Pei Ming’s departure, Pao-yü continued on pins on\nneedles and on the tiptoe of expectation. Into such a pitch of\nexcitement did he work himself, that he felt like an ant in a burning\npan. With suppressed impatience, he waited and waited until sunset. At\nlast then he perceived Pei Ming walk in, in high glee.",
        "“Have you discovered the place?” hastily inquired Pao-yü.",
        "“Master,” Pei Ming laughed, “you didn’t catch distinctly the directions\ngiven you, and you made me search in a nice way! The name of the place\nand the bearings can’t be those you gave me, Sir; that is why I’ve had\nto hunt about the whole day long! I prosecuted my inquiries up to the\nvery ditch on the north east side, before I eventually found a ruined\ntemple.”",
        "Upon hearing the result of his researches, Pao-yü was much gratified.\nHis very eyebrows distended. His eyes laughed. “Old goody Liu,” he said\nwith eagerness, “is a person well up in years, and she may at the moment\nhave remembered wrong; it’s very likely she did. But recount to me what\nyou saw.”",
        "“The door of that temple,” Pei Ming explained, “really faces south, and\nis all in a tumble-down condition. I searched and searched till I was\ndriven to utter despair. As soon, however, as I caught sight of it,\n’that’s right,’ I shouted, and promptly walked in. But I at once\ndiscovered a clay figure, which gave me such a fearful start, that I\nscampered out again; for it looked as much alive as if it were a real\nliving being.”",
        "Pao-yü smiled full of joy. “It can metamorphose itself into a human\nbeing,” he observed, “so, of course, it has more or less a life-like\nappearance.”",
        "“Was it ever a girl?” Pei Ming rejoined clapping his hands. “Why it was,\nin fact, no more than a green-faced and red-haired god of plagues.”",
        "Pao-yü, at this answer, spat at him contemptuously. “You are, in very\ntruth, a useless fool!” he cried. “Haven’t you even enough gumption for\nsuch a trifling job as this?”",
        "“What book, I wonder, have you again been reading, master?” Pei Ming\ncontinued. “Or you may, perhaps, have heard some one prattle a lot of\ntrash and believed it as true! You send me on this sort of wild goose\nchase and make me go and knock my head about, and how can you ever say\nthat I’m good for nothing?”",
        "Pao-yü did not fail to notice that he was in a state of exasperation so\nhe lost no time in trying to calm him. “Don’t be impatient!” he urged.\n\"You can go again some other day, when you’ve got nothing to attend to,\nand institute further inquiries! If it turns out that she has\nhood-winked us, why, there will, naturally, be no such thing. But if,\nverily, there is, won’t you also lay up for yourself a store of good\ndeeds? I shall feel it my duty to reward you in a most handsome manner.”",
        "As he spoke, he espied a servant-lad, on service at the second gate,\napproach and report to him: “The young ladies in our venerable\nladyship’s apartments are standing at the threshold of the second gate\nand looking out for you, Mr. Secundus.”",
        "But as, reader, you are not aware what they were on the look-out to tell\nhim, the subsequent chapter will explain it for you.",
