        "                 What happened at Farmer Grove’s;\n                and how she gratified him for the Use\n                           of his Room.",
        "While at Mr. Grove’s, which was in the Heart of the Village,\nshe not only taught the Children in the Day Time, but the Farmer’s\nServants, and all the Neighbours, to read and write in the Evening;\nand it was a constant Practice before they went away, to make them all\ngo to Prayers, and sing Psalms. By this Means, the People grew\nextremely regular, his Servants were always at Home, instead of being\nat the Ale-house, and he had more Work done than ever. This gave not\nonly Mr. Grove, but all the Neighbours, an high Opinion of her\ngood Sense and prudent Behaviour: And she was so much esteemed, that\nmost of the Differences in the Parish were left to her Decision; and\nif a Man and Wife quarrelled (which sometimes happened in that Part of\nthe Kingdom) both Parties certainly came to her for Advice. Every Body\nknows, that Martha Wilson was a passionate scolding Jade, and\nthat John her husband, was a surly ill-tempered Fellow. These\nwere one Day brought by the Neighbours for Margery to talk to\nthem, when they fairly quarrelled before her, and were going to Blows;\nbut she stepping between them, thus addressed the Husband;\nJohn, says she, you are a Man, and ought to have more Sense\nthan to fly in a Passion, at every Word that is said amiss by your\nWife; and Martha, says she, you ought to know your Duty better,\nthan to say any Thing to aggravate your Husband’s Resentment. These\nfrequent Quarrels, arise from the Indulgence of your violent Passions;\nfor I know, you both love one another, notwithstanding what has passed\nbetween you. Now, pray tell me John, and tell me Martha,\nwhen you have had a Quarrel the over Night, are you not both sorry for\nit the next Day? They both declared that they were: Why then, says\nshe, I’ll tell you how to prevent this for the future, if you will\nboth promise to take my Advice. They both promised her. You know, says\nshe, that a small Spark will set Fire to Tinder, and that Tinder\nproperly placed will fire a House; an angry Word is with you as that\nSpark, for you are both as touchy as Tinder, and very often make your\nown House too hot to hold you. To prevent this, therefore, and to live\nhappily for the future, you must solemnly agree, that if one speaks an\nangry Word, the other will not answer, ’till he or she has distinctly\ncalled over all the Letters in the Alphabet, and the other not reply,\n’till he has told twenty; by this Means your Passions will be stifled,\nand Reason will have Time to take the Rule.",
        "This is the best Recipe that was ever given for a married Couple to\nlive in Peace: Though John and his Wife frequently attempted to\nquarrel afterwards, they never could get their Passions to any\nconsiderable Height, for there was something so droll in thus carrying\non the Dispute, that before they got to the End of the Argument, they\nsaw the Absurdity of it, laughed, kissed, and were Friends.",
        "Just as Mrs. Margery had settled this Difference between\nJohn and his Wife, the Children (who had been sent out to play,\nwhile that Business was transacting) returned some in Tears, and\nothers very disconsolate, for the Loss of a little Dormouse they were\nvery fond of, and which was just dead. Mrs. Margery, who had\nthe Art of moralizing and drawing Instructions from every Accident,\ntook this Opportunity of reading them a Lecture on the Uncertainty of\nLife, and the Necessity of being always prepared for Death. You should\nget up in the Morning, says she, and to conduct yourselves, as if that\nDay was to be your last, and lie down at Night, as if you never\nexpected to see this World any more. This may be done, says she,\nwithout abating of your Chearfulness, for you are not to consider\nDeath as an Evil, but as a Convenience, as an useful Pilot, who is to\nconvey you to a Place of greater Happiness: Therefore, play my dear\nChildren, and be merry; but be innocent and good. The good Man sets\nDeath at Defiance, for his Darts are only dreadful to the Wicked.",
        "After this, she permitted the Children to bury the little Dormouse,\nand desired one of them to write his Epitaph, and here it is.",
        "Epitaph on a DORMOUSE, really\n     written by a little BOY.",
        "  In Paper Case,\n  Hard by this Place,\nDead a poor Dormouse lies;\n  And soon or late,\n  Summon’d by Fate,\nEach Prince, each Monarch dies.",
        "  Ye Sons of Verse,\n  While I rehearse,\nAttend instructive Rhyme;\n  No Sins had Dor,\n  To answer for,\nRepent of yours in Time.",
