        "Thence went then Siegfried / out through the castle door\nIn his sightless mantle / to a boat upon the shore.\nAs Siegmund’s son doth board it / him no mortal sees;\nAnd quickly off he steers it / as were it wafted by the breeze.",
        "483",
        "No one saw the boatman, / yet rapid was the flight\nOf the boat forth speeding / driven by Siegfried’s might.\nThey weened that did speed it / a swiftly blowing wind:\nNo, ’twas Siegfried sped it, / the son of fairest Siegelind.",
        "484",
        "In that one day-time / and the following night\nCame he to a country / by dint of mickle might,\nLong miles a hundred distant, / and something more than this:\nThe Nibelungen were its people / where the mighty hoard was his.",
        "485",
        "Alone did fare the hero / unto an island vast\nWhereon the boat full quickly / the gallant knight made fast.\nOf a castle then bethought him / high upon a hill,\nAnd there a lodging sought him, / as wayworn men are wont to still.",
        "486",
        "Then came he to the portals / that locked before him stood.\nThey guarded well their honor / as people ever should.\nAt the door he gan a-knocking, / for all unknown was he.\nBut full well ’twas guarded, / and within it he did see",
        "487",
        "A giant who the castle / did guard with watchful eye,\nAnd near him did at all times / his good weapons lie.\nQuoth he: “Who now that knocketh / at the door in such strange wise?\"\nWithout the valiant Siegfried / did cunningly his voice disguise.",
        "488",
        "He spake: “A bold knight-errant / am I; unlock the gate.\nElse will I from without here / disturbance rare create\nFor all who’d fain lie quiet / and their rest would take.\"\nWrathful grew the Porter / as in this wise Siegfried spake.",
        "489",
        "Now did the giant valorous / his good armor don,\nAnd placed on head his helmet; / then the full doughty man\nHis shield up-snatched quickly / and gate wide open swung.\nHow sore was he enraged / as himself upon Siegfried he flung!",
        "490",
        "’How dared he thus awaken / brave knights within the hall?’\nThe blows in rapid showers / from his hand did fall.\nThereat the noble stranger / began himself to shield.\nFor so a club of iron / the Porter’s mighty arm did wield,",
        "491",
        "That splinters flew from buckler, / and Siegfried stood aghast\nFrom fear that this same hour / was doomed to be his last,\nSo mightily the Porter’s / blows about him fell.\nTo find such faithful warder / did please his master Siegfried well.",
        "492",
        "So fiercely did they struggle / that castle far within\nAnd hall where slept the Nibelungen / echoed back the din.\nBut Siegfried pressed the Porter / and soon he had him bound.\nIn all the land of Nibelungen / the story soon was bruited round.",
        "493",
        "When the grim sound of fighting / afar the place had filled,\nAlberich did hear it, / a Dwarf full brave and wild.\nHe donned his armor deftly, / and running thither found\nThis so noble stranger / where he the doughty Porter bound.",
        "494",
        "Alberich was full wrathy, / thereto a man of power.\nCoat of mail and helmet / he on his body wore,\nAnd in his hand a heavy / scourge of gold he swung.\nWhere was fighting Siegfried, / thither in mickle haste he sprung.",
        "495",
        "Seven knobs thick and heavy / on the club’s end were seen,\nWherewith the shield that guarded / the knight that was so keen\nHe battered with such vigor / that pieces from it brake.\nLest he his life should forfeit / the noble stranger gan to quake.",
        "496",
        "The shield that all was battered / from his hand he flung;\nAnd into sheath, too, thrust he / his sword so good and long.\nFor his trusty chamberlain / he did not wish to slay,\nAnd in such case he could not / grant his anger fullest sway.",
        "497",
        "With but his hands so mighty / at Alberich he ran.\nBy the beard then seized he / the gray and aged man,\nAnd in such manner pulled it / that he full loud did roar.\nThe youthful hero’s conduct / Alberich did trouble sore.",
        "498",
        "Loud cried the valiant steward: / “Have mercy now on me.\nAnd might I other’s vassal / than one good hero’s be,\nTo whom to be good subject / I an oath did take,\nUntil my death I’d serve thee.\" / Thus the man of cunning spake.",
        "499",
        "Alberich then bound he / as the giant before.\nThe mighty arm of Siegfried / did trouble him full sore.\nThe Dwarf began to question: / “Thy name, what may it be?\"\nQuoth he: “My name is Siegfried; / I weened I well were known to thee.”",
        "500",
        "“I joy to hear such tidings,\" / Dwarf Alberich replied.\n“Well now have I found thee / in knightly prowess tried,\nAnd with goodly reason / lord o’er lands to be.\nI’ll do whate’er thou biddest, / wilt thou only give me free.”",
        "501",
        "Then spake his master Siegfried: / “Quickly shalt thou go,\nAnd bring me knights hither, / the best we have to show,\nA thousand Nibelungen, / to stand before their lord.\"\nWherefore thus he wished it, / spake he never yet a word.",
        "502",
        "The giant and Alberich / straightway he unbound.\nThen ran Alberich quickly / where the knights he found.\nThe warriors of Nibelung / he wakened full of fear.\nQuoth he: “Be up, ye heroes, / before Siegfried shall ye appear.”",
        "503",
        "From their couches sprang they / and ready were full soon,\nClothed well in armor / a thousand warriors boon,\nAnd went where they found standing / Siegfried their lord.\nThen was a mickle greeting / courteously in act and word.",
        "504",
        "Candles many were lighted, / and sparkling wine he drank.\nThat they came so quickly, / therefor he all did thank.\nQuoth he: “Now shall ye with me / from hence across the flood.\"\nThereto he found full ready / the heroes valiant and good.",
        "505",
        "Good thirty hundred warriors / soon had hither pressed,\nFrom whom were then a thousand / taken of the best.\nFor them were brought their helmets / and what they else did need.\nFor unto Brunhild’s country / would he straightway the warriors lead.",
        "506",
        "He spake: “Ye goodly nobles, / that would I have you hear,\nIn full costly raiment / shall ye at court appear,\nFor yonder must there see us / full many a fair lady.\nTherefore shall your bodies / dight in good apparel be.”",
        "507",
        "Upon a morning early / went they on their way.\nWhat host of brave companions / bore Siegfried company!\nGood steeds took they with them / and garments rich to wear,\nAnd did in courtly fashion / unto Brunhild’s country fare.",
        "508",
        "As gazed from lofty parapet / women fair to see,\nSpake the queen unto them: / “Knows any who they be,\nWhom I see yonder sailing / upon the sea afar?\nRich sails their ships do carry, / whiter than snow they are.”",
        "509",
        "Then spake the king of Rhineland: / “My good men they are,\nThat on my journey hither / left I lying near.\nI’ve sent to call them to me: / now are they come, O Queen.\"\nWith full great amazing / were the stately strangers seen.",
        "510",
        "There saw they Siegfried / out on the ship’s prow stand\nClad in costly raiment, / and with him his good band.\nThen spake Queen Brunhild: / “Good monarch, let me know,\nShall I go forth to greet them, / or shall I greetings high forego?”",
        "511",
        "He spake: “Thou shalt to meet them / before the palace go,\nSo that we see them gladly / they may surely know.\"\nThen did the royal lady / fulfil the king’s behest.\nYet Siegfried in the greeting / was not honored with the rest.",
        "512",
        "Lodgings were made ready / and their armor ta’en in hand.\nThen was such host of strangers / come into that land,\nOn all sides they jostled / from the great company.\nThen would the knights full valiant / homeward fare to Burgundy.",
        "513",
        "Then spake Queen Brunhild: / “In favor would I hold\nWho might now apportion / my silver and my gold\nTo my guests and the monarch’s, / for goodly store I have.\"\nThereto an answer Dankwart, / Giselher’s good warrior, gave:",
        "514",
        "“Full noble royal Lady, / give me the keys to hold.\nI trow I’ll so divide it,\" / spake the warrior bold,\n“If blame there be about it, / that shall be mine alone.\"\nThat he was not a niggard, / beyond a doubt he soon had shown.",
        "515",
        "When now Hagen’s brother / the treasure did command,\nSo many a lavish bounty / dealt out the hero’s hand,\nWhoso mark did covet, / to him was given such store\nThat all who once were poor men / might joyous live for evermore.",
        "516",
        "In sooth good pounds a hundred / gave he to each and all.\nA host in costly raiment / were seen before the hall,\nWho in equal splendor / ne’er before were clad.\nWhen the queen did hear it, / verily her heart was sad.",
        "517",
        "Then spake the royal lady: / “Good King, it little needs,\nThat now thy chamberlain / of all my stately weeds\nLeave no whit remaining, / and squander clean my gold.\nWould any yet prevent it, / him would I aye in favor hold.",
        "518",
        "“He deals with hand so lavish, / in sooth doth ween the thane\nThat death I’ve hither summoned; / but longer I’ll remain.\nEke trow I well to spend all / my sire hath left to me.\"\nNe’er found queen a chamberlain / of such passing generosity.",
        "519",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Lady, be thou told,\nThat the king of Rhineland / raiment hath and gold\nSo plenteous to lavish / that we may well forego\nTo carry with us homeward / aught that Brunhild can bestow.”",
        "520",
        "“No; as high ye hold me,\" / spake the queen again,\n“Let me now have filled / coffers twice times ten\nOf gold and silken raiment, / that may deal out my hand,\nWhen that we come over / into royal Gunther’s land.”",
        "521",
        "Then with precious jewels / the coffers they filled for her.\nThe while her own chamberlain / must be standing near:\nFor no whit would she trust it / unto Giselher’s man.\nWhereat Gunther and Hagen / heartily to laugh began.",
        "522",
        "Then spake the royal lady: / “To whom leave I my lands?\nFirst must they now be given / in charge from out our hands.\"\nThen spake the noble monarch: / “Whomsoe’er it pleaseth thee,\nBid him now come hither, / the same we’ll let our Warden be.”",
        "523",
        "One of her highest kindred / near by the lady spied,\n–He was her mother’s brother– / to him thus spake the maid:\n“Now be to thee entrusted / the castles and eke the land,\nUntil that here shall govern / Gunther the king by his own hand.”",
        "524",
        "Trusty knights two thousand / from her company\nChose she to journey with her / unto Burgundy,\nBeyond those thousand warriors / from Nibelungenland.\nThey made ready for the journey, / and downward rode unto the strand.",
        "525",
        "Six and eighty ladies / led they thence with her,\nThereto good hundred maidens / that full beauteous were.\nThey tarried no whit longer, / for they to part were fain.\nOf those they left behind them, / O how they all to weep began!",
        "526",
        "In high befitting fashion / quitted she her land:\nShe kissed of nearest kindred / all who round did stand.\nAfter fair leave-taking / they went upon the sea.\nBack to her father’s country / came never more that fair lady.",
        "527",
        "Then heard you on the journey / many a kind of play:\nEvery pleasant pastime / in plenty had they.\nSoon had they for their journey / a wind from proper art:\nSo with full great rejoicing / did they from that land depart.",
        "528",
        "Yet would she on the journey / not be the monarch’s spouse:\nBut was their pleasant pastime / reserved for his own house\nAt Worms within his castle / at a high festival,\nWhither anon full joyous / came they with their warriors all.",
