        "A “Family Physician,” published in 1883, says, for the bite of a mad dog:\n“Take ash-colored ground liverwort, cleaned, dried, and powdered, half an\nounce; of black pepper, powdered, a quarter of an ounce. Mix these well\ntogether, and divide the powder into four doses, one of which must be\ntaken every morning, fasting, for four mornings successively in half an\nEnglish pint of cow’s milk, warm. After these four doses are taken, the\npatient must go into the cold bath, or a cold spring or river, every\nmorning, fasting, for a month. He must be dipped all over, but not stay in\n(with his head above water) longer than half a minute if the water is very\ncold. After this he must go in three times a week for a fortnight longer.\nHe must be bled before he begins to take the medicine.”",
        "It is very difficult to know just what is best to do when a person is\nbitten by a mad dog, but my own advice would be to kill the dog. After\nthat feel of the leg where bitten, and ascertain how serious the injury\nhas been. Then go home and put on another pair of pantaloons, throwing\naway those that have been lacerated. Parties having but one pair of\npantaloons will have to sequester themselves or excite remarks. Then take\na cold bath, as suggested above, but do not remain in the bath (with the\nhead above water) more than half an hour. If the head is under water, you\nmay remain in the bath until the funeral, if you think best.",
        "When going into the bath it would be well to take something in your pocket\nto bite, in case the desire to bite something should overcome you. Some\nuse a common shingle-nail for this purpose, while others prefer a personal\nfriend. In any event, do not bite a total stranger on an empty stomach. It\nmight make you ill.",
        "Never catch a dog by the tail if he has hydrophobia. Although that end of\nthe dog is considered the most safe, you never know when a mad dog may\nreverse himself.",
        "If you meet a mad dog on the street, do not stop and try to quell him with\na glance of the eye. Many have tried to do that, and it took several days\nto separate the two and tell which was mad dog and which was queller.",
        "The real hydrophobia dog generally ignores kindness, and devotes himself\nmostly to the introduction of his justly celebrated virus. A good thing to\ndo on observing the approach of a mad dog is to flee, and remain fled\nuntil he has disappeared.",
        "Hunting mad dogs in a crowded street is great sport. A young man with a\nnew revolver shooting at a mad dog is a fine sight. He may not kill the\ndog, but he might shoot into a covey of little children and possibly get\none.",
        "It would be a good plan to have a balloon inflated and tied in the back\nyard during the season in which mad dogs mature, and get into it on the\napproach of the infuriated animal (get into the balloon, I mean, not the\ndog).",
        "This plan would not work well, however, in case a cyclone should come at\nthe same time. When we consider all the uncertainties of life, and the\ndanger from hydrophobia, cyclones and breach of promise, it seems\nsometimes as though the penitentiary was the only place where a man could\nbe absolutely free from anxiety.",
        "If you discover that your dog has hydrophobia, it is absolutely foolish to\ntry to cure him of the disease. The best plan is to trade him off at once\nfor anything you can get. Do not stop to haggle over the price, but close\nhim right out below cost.",
        "Do not tie a tin can to the tail of a mad dog. It only irritates him, and\nhe might resent it before you get the can tied on. A friend of mine, who\nwas a practical joker, once sought to tie a tin can to the tail of a mad\ndog on an empty stomach. His widow still points with pride to the marks of\nhis teeth on the piano. If mad dogs would confine themselves exclusively\nto practical jokers, I would be glad to endow a home for indigent mad dogs\nout of my own private funds.",
