        "Human isolation is an unnatural condition.  It antagonizes the highest\nand best interests of the world.  Its influence is never beneficent,\nbut always and necessarily harmful.  If the truest well being of the\nuniverse, and the supremest glory of Jehovah could have been attained\nby conditions of solitude, it is not impossible that the good\nAll-Father would have given to every man a continent, and so have made\nhim monarch of all he surveyed.",
        "Physically regarded, there is no limit to Omnipotent power.  A\ncontinent, and even a world, was therefore within the pale of divine\npossibilities.  Jehovah, however, is not only great, but he is the\nGreatness of Goodness.  High and holy ends were to be accomplished, and\nhappy purposes to be secured, by means of human instrumentalities, and\nbe jointly shared by Creator and creature.",
        "Among the earliest of Deific utterances, therefore, we have this: “It\nis not good that man should be alone.”  I concede that, primarily, the\ncompanionship of woman is here intended.  But the declaration is not\nonly good in this, but equally so in other regards.  A lifetime of\nsolitude with no incentives to action–nothing to draw out, exercise\nand expand the latent powers of the soul–no interchange of thought–no\nclashing of opinion–no towering resolves to stimulate–no difficulties\nto surmount!  What imagination so fertile that it could picture a more\nhateful or intolerable Hades than would be such a condition of affairs?",
        "Hence, in the early days of the world’s history we discern the\nprinciple of association and co-operation, with plans and systems\nembodying its practical application.  Organizations came into being,\nobedient to the summons of necessity.  How well the various\norganizations have wrought along the pathway of centuries, and how\ngreat or small may have been the measure of their success, I am not\nhere to discuss, much less to determine.  Each has done its work in its\nown way, and pockets responsibility for results.  Common courtesy and\ncandor suggest that each has been largely animated by highest and\nworthiest of motives.",
