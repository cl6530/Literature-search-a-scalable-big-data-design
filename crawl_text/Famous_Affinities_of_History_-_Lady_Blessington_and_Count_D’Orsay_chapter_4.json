        "Often there has arisen some man who, either by his natural gifts\nor by his impudence or by the combination of both, has made\nhimself a recognized leader in the English fashionable world. One\nof the first of these men was Richard Nash, usually known as “Beau\nNash,” who flourished in the eighteenth century. Nash was a man of\ndoubtful origin; nor was he attractive in his looks, for he was a\nhuge, clumsy creature with features that were both irregular and\nharsh. Nevertheless, for nearly fifty years Beau Nash was an\narbiter of fashion. Goldsmith, who wrote his life, declared that\nhis supremacy was due to his pleasing manners, “his assiduity,\nflattery, fine clothes, and as much wit as the ladies had whom he\naddressed.” He converted the town of Bath from a rude little\nhamlet into an English Newport, of which he was the social\nautocrat. He actually drew up a set of written rules which some of\nthe best-born and best-bred people follow slavishly.",
        "Even better known to us is George Bryan Brummel, commonly called\n“Beau Brummel,” who by his friendship with George IV.–then Prince\nRegent–was an oracle at court on everything that related to dress\nand etiquette and the proper mode of living. His memory has been\nkept alive most of all by Richard Mansfield’s famous impersonation\nof him. The play is based upon the actual facts; for after Brummel\nhad lost the royal favor he died an insane pauper in the French\ntown of Caen. He, too, had a distinguished biographer, since\nBulwer-Lytton’s novel Pelham is really the narrative of Brummel’s\ncurious career.",
        "Long after Brummel, Lord Banelagh led the gilded youth of London,\nand it was at this time that the notorious Lola Montez made her\nfirst appearance in the British capital.",
        "These three men–Nash, Brummel, and Ranelagh–had the advantage of\nbeing Englishmen, and, therefore, of not incurring the old-time\nEnglish suspicion of foreigners. A much higher type of social\narbiter was a Frenchman who for twenty years during the early part\nof Queen Victoria’s reign gave law to the great world of fashion,\nbesides exercising a definite influence upon English art and\nliterature.",
        "This was Count Albert Guillaume d’Orsay, the son of one of\nNapoleon’s generals, and descended by a morganatic marriage from\nthe King of Wurttemburg. The old general, his father, was a man of\nhigh courage, impressive appearance, and keen intellect, all of\nwhich qualities he transmitted to his son. The young Count\nd’Orsay, when he came of age, found the Napoleonic era ended and\nFrance governed by Louis XVIII. The king gave Count d’Orsay a\ncommission in the army in a regiment stationed at Valence in the\nsoutheastern part of France. He had already visited England and\nlearned the English language, and he had made some distinguished\nfriends there, among whom were Lord Byron and Thomas Moore.",
        "On his return to France he began his garrison life at Valence,\nwhere he showed some of the finer qualities of his character. It\nis not merely that he was handsome and accomplished and that he\nhad the gift of winning the affections of those about him. Unlike\nNash and Brummel, he was a gentleman in every sense, and his\ncourtesy was of the highest kind. At the balls given by his\nregiment, although he was more courted than any other officer, he\nalways sought out the plainest girls and showed them the most\nflattering attentions. No “wallflowers” were left neglected when\nD’Orsay was present.",
        "It is strange how completely human beings are in the hands of\nfate. Here was a young French officer quartered in a provincial\ntown in the valley of the Rhone. Who would have supposed that he\nwas destined to become not only a Londoner, but a favorite at the\nBritish court, a model of fashion, a dictator of etiquette, widely\nknown for his accomplishments, the patron of literary men and of\ndistinguished artists? But all these things were to come to pass\nby a mere accident of fortune.",
        "During his firsts visit to London, which has already been\nmentioned, Count d’Orsay was invited once or twice to receptions\ngiven by the Earl and Countess of Blessington, where he was well\nreceived, though this was only an incident of his English sojourn.\nBefore the story proceeds any further it is necessary to give an\naccount of the Earl and of Lady Blessington, since both of their\ncareers had been, to say the least, unusual.",
        "Lord Blessington was an Irish peer for whom an ancient title had\nbeen revived. He was remotely descended from the Stuarts of\nScotland, and therefore had royal blood to boast of. He had been\nwell educated, and in many ways was a man of pleasing manner. On\nthe other hand, he had early inherited a very large property which\nyielded him an income of about thirty thousand pounds a year. He\nhad estates in Ireland, and he owned nearly the whole of a\nfashionable street in London, with the buildings erected on it.",
        "This fortune and the absence of any one who could control him had\nmade him wilful and extravagant and had wrought in him a curious\nlove of personal display. Even as a child he would clamor to be\ndressed in the most gorgeous uniforms; and when he got possession\nof his property his love of display became almost a monomania. He\nbuilt a theater as an adjunct to his country house in Ireland and\nimported players from London and elsewhere to act in it. He loved\nto mingle with the mummers, to try on their various costumes, and\nto parade up and down, now as an oriental prince and now as a\nRoman emperor.",
        "In London he hung about the green-rooms, and was a well-known\nfigure wherever actors or actresses were collected. Such was his\nlove of the stage that he sought to marry into the profession and\nset his heart on a girl named Mary Campbell Browne, who was very\nbeautiful to look at, but who was not conspicuous either for her\nmind or for her morals. When Lord Blessington proposed marriage to\nher she was obliged to tell him that she already had one husband\nstill alive, but she was perfectly willing to live with him and\ndispense with the marriage ceremony. So for several years she did\nlive with him and bore him two children.",
        "It speaks well for the earl that when the inconvenient husband\ndied a marriage at once took place and Mrs. Browne became a\ncountess. Then, after other children had been born, the lady died,\nleaving the earl a widower at about the age of forty. The only\nlegitimate son born of this marriage followed his mother to the\ngrave; and so for the third time the earldom of Blessington seemed\nlikely to become extinct. The death of his wife, however, gave the\nearl a special opportunity to display his extravagant tastes. He\nspent more than four thousand pounds on the funeral ceremonies,\nimporting from France a huge black velvet catafalque which had\nshortly before been used at the public funeral of Napoleon’s\nmarshal, Duroc, while the house blazed with enormous wax tapers\nand glittered with cloth of gold.",
        "Lord Blessington soon plunged again into the busy life of London.\nHaving now no heir, there was no restraint on his expenditures,\nand he borrowed large sums of money in order to buy additional\nestates and houses and to experience the exquisite joy of spending\nlavishly. At this time he had his lands in Ireland, a town house\nin St. James’s Square, another in Seymour Place, and still another\nwhich was afterward to become famous as Gore House, in Kensington.",
        "Some years before he had met in Ireland a lady called Mrs. Maurice\nFarmer; and it happened that she now came to London. The earlier\nstory of her still young life must here be told, because her name\nafterward became famous, and because the tale illustrates\nwonderfully well the raw, crude, lawless period of the Regency,\nwhen England was fighting her long war with Napoleon, when the\nPrince Regent was imitating all the vices of the old French kings,\nwhen prize-fighting, deep drinking, dueling, and dicing were\npractised without restraint in all the large cities and towns of\nthe United Kingdom. It was, as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has said,\n“an age of folly and of heroism\"; for, while it produced some of\nthe greatest black-guards known to history, it produced also such\nmen as Wellington and Nelson, the two Pitts, Sheridan, Byron,\nShelley, and Sir Walter Scott.",
        "Mrs. Maurice Farmer was the daughter of a small Irish landowner\nnamed Robert Power–himself the incarnation of all the vices of\nthe time. There was little law in Ireland, not even that which\ncomes from public opinion; and Robert Power rode hard to hounds,\ngambled recklessly, and assembled in his house all sorts of\nreprobates, with whom he held frightful orgies that lasted from\nsunset until dawn. His wife and his young daughters viewed him\nwith terror, and the life they led was a perpetual nightmare\nbecause of the bestial carousings in which their father engaged,\nwasting his money and mortgaging his estates until the end of his\nwild career was in plain sight.",
        "There happened to be stationed at Clonmel a regiment of infantry\nin which there served a captain named Maurice St. Leger Farmer. He\nwas a man of some means, but eccentric to a degree. His temper was\nso utterly uncontrolled that even his fellow officers could\nscarcely live with him, and he was given to strange caprices. It\nhappened that at a ball in Clonmel he met the young daughter of\nRobert Power, then a mere child of fourteen years. Captain Farmer\nwas seized with an infatuation for the girl, and he went almost at\nonce to her father, asking for her hand in marriage and proposing\nto settle a sum of money upon her if she married him.",
        "The hard-riding squireen jumped at the offer. His own estate was\nbeing stripped bare. Here was a chance to provide for one of his\ndaughters, or, rather, to get rid of her, and he agreed that she\nshould be married out of hand. Going home, he roughly informed the\ngirl that she was to be the wife of Captain Farmer. He so bullied\nhis wife that she was compelled to join him in this command.",
        "What was poor little Margaret Power to do? She was only a child.\nShe knew nothing of the world. She was accustomed to obey her\nfather as she would have obeyed some evil genius who had her in\nhis power. There were tears and lamentations. She was frightened\nhalf to death; yet for her there was no help. Therefore, while not\nyet fifteen her marriage took place, and she was the unhappy slave\nof a half-crazy tyrant. She had then no beauty whatsoever. She was\nwholly undeveloped–thin and pale, and with rough hair that fell\nover her frightened eyes; yet Farmer wanted her, and he settled\nhis money on her, just as he would have spent the same amount to\ngratify any other sudden whim.",
        "The life she led with him for a few months showed him to be more\nof a devil than a man. He took a peculiar delight in terrifying\nher, in subjecting her to every sort of outrage; nor did he\nrefrain even from beating her with his fists. The girl could stand\na great deal, but this was too much. She returned to her father’s\nhouse, where she was received with the bitterest reproaches, but\nwhere, at least, she was safe from harm, since her possession of a\ndowry made her a person of some small importance.",
        "Not long afterward Captain Farmer fell into a dispute with his\ncolonel, Lord Caledon, and in the course of it he drew his sword\non his commanding officer. The court-martial which was convened to\ntry him would probably have had him shot were it not for the very\ngeneral belief that he was insane. So he was simply cashiered and\nobliged to leave the service and betake himself elsewhere. Thus\nthe girl whom, he had married was quite free–free to leave her\nwretched home and even to leave Ireland.",
        "She did leave Ireland and establish herself in London, where she\nhad some acquaintances, among them the Earl of Blessington. As\nalready said, he had met her in Ireland while she was living with\nher husband; and now from time to time he saw her in a friendly\nway. After the death of his wife he became infatuated with\nMargaret Farmer. She was a good deal alone, and his attentions\ngave her entertainment. Her past experience led her to have no\nreal belief in love. She had become, however, in a small way\ninterested in literature and art, with an eager ambition to be\nknown as a writer. As it happened, Captain Farmer, whose name she\nbore, had died some months before Lord Blessington had decided to\nmake a new marriage. The earl proposed to Margaret Farmer, and the\ntwo were married by special license.",
        "The Countess of Blessington–to give the lady her new title–was\nnow twenty-eight years of age and had developed into a woman of\ngreat beauty. She was noted for the peculiarly vivacious and\nradiant expression which was always on her face. She had a kind of\nvivid loveliness accompanied by grace, simplicity, and a form of\nexquisite proportions. The ugly duckling had become a swan, for\nnow there was no trace of her former plainness to be seen.",
        "Not yet in her life had love come to her. Her first husband had\nbeen thrust upon her and had treated her outrageously. Her second\nhusband was much older than she; and, though she was not without a\ncertain kindly feeling for one who had been kind to her, she\nmarried him, first of all, for his title and position.",
        "Having been reared in poverty, she had no conception of the value\nof money; and, though the earl was remarkably extravagant, the new\ncountess was even more so. One after another their London houses\nwere opened and decorated with the utmost lavishness. They gave\ninnumerable entertainments, not only to the nobility and to men of\nrank, but–because this was Lady Blessington’s peculiar fad–to\nartists and actors and writers of all degrees. The American, N. P.\nWillis, in his Pencilings by the Way, has given an interesting\nsketch of the countess and her surroundings, while the younger\nDisraeli (Lord Beaconsfield) has depicted D’Orsay as Count Mirabel\nin Henrietta Temple. Willis says:",
        "In a long library, lined alternately with splendidly bound books\nand mirrors, and with a deep window of the breadth of the room\nopening upon Hyde Park, I found Lady Blessington alone. The\npicture, to my eye, as the door opened, was a very lovely one–a\nwoman of remarkable beauty, half buried in a fauteuil of yellow\nsatin, reading by a magnificent lamp suspended from the center of\nthe arched ceiling. Sofas, couches, ottomans, and busts, arranged\nin rather a crowded sumptuousness through the room; enameled\ntables, covered with expensive and elegant trifles in every\ncorner, and a delicate white hand in relief on the back of a book,\nto which the eye was attracted by the blaze of diamond rings.",
        "All this “crowded sumptuousness” was due to the taste of Lady\nBlessington. Amid it she received royal dukes, statesmen such as\nPalmerston, Canning, Castlereagh, Russell, and Brougham, actors\nsuch as Kemble and Matthews, artists such as Lawrence and Wilkie,\nand men of letters such as Moore, Bulwer-Lytton, and the two\nDisraelis. To maintain this sort of life Lord Blessington raised\nlarge amounts of money, totaling about half a million pounds\nsterling, by mortgaging his different estates and giving his\npromissory notes to money-lenders. Of course, he did not spend\nthis vast sum immediately. He might have lived in comparative\nluxury upon his income; but he was a restless, eager, improvident\nnobleman, and his extravagances were prompted by the urgings of\nhis wife.",
        "In all this display, which Lady Blessington both stimulated and\nshared, there is to be found a psychological basis. She was now\nverging upon the thirties–a time which is a very critical period\nin a woman’s emotional life, if she has not already given herself\nover to love and been loved in return. During Lady Blessington’s\nearlier years she had suffered in many ways, and it is probable\nthat no thought of love had entered her mind. She was only too\nglad if she could escape from the harshness of her father and the\ncruelty of her first husband. Then came her development into a\nbeautiful woman, content for the time to be languorously stagnant\nand to enjoy the rest and peace which had come to her.",
        "When she married Lord Blessington her love life had not yet\ncommenced; and, in fact, there could be no love life in such a\nmarriage–a marriage with a man much older than herself, scatter-\nbrained, showy, and having no intellectual gifts. So for a time\nshe sought satisfaction in social triumphs, in capturing political\nand literary lions in order to exhibit them in her salon, and in\nspending money right and left with a lavish hand. But, after all,\nin a woman of her temperament none of these things could satisfy\nher inner longings. Beautiful, full of Celtic vivacity,\nimaginative and eager, such a nature as hers would in the end be\nstarved unless her heart should be deeply touched and unless all\nher pent-up emotion could give itself up entirely in the great\nsurrender.",
        "After a few years of London she grew restless and dissatisfied.\nHer surroundings wearied her. There was a call within her for\nsomething more than she had yet experienced. The earl, her\nhusband, was by nature no less restless; and so, without knowing\nthe reason–which, indeed, she herself did not understand–he\nreadily assented to a journey on the Continent.",
        "As they traveled southward they reached at length the town of\nValence, where Count d’Orsay was still quartered with his\nregiment. A vague, indefinable feeling of attraction swept over\nthis woman, who was now a woman of the world and yet quite\ninexperienced in affairs relating to the heart. The mere sound of\nthe French officer’s voice, the mere sight of his face, the mere\nknowledge of his presence, stirred her as nothing had ever stirred\nher until that time. Yet neither he nor she appears to have been\nconscious at once of the secret of their liking. It was enough\nthat they were soothed and satisfied with each other’s company.",
        "Oddly enough, the Earl of Blessington became as devoted to D’Orsay\nas did his wife. The two urged the count to secure a leave of\nabsence and to accompany them to Italy. This he was easily\npersuaded to do; and the three passed weeks and months of a\nlanguorous and alluring intercourse among the lakes and the\nseductive influence of romantic Italy. Just what passed between\nCount d’Orsay and Margaret Blessington at this time cannot be\nknown, for the secret of it has perished with them; but it is\ncertain that before very long they came to know that each was\nindispensable to the other.",
        "The situation was complicated by the Earl of Blessington, who,\nentirely unsuspicious, proposed that the Count should marry Lady\nHarriet Gardiner, his eldest legitimate daughter by his first\nwife. He pressed the match upon the embarrassed D’Orsay, and\noffered to settle the sum of forty thousand pounds upon the bride.\nThe girl was less than fifteen years of age. She had no gifts\neither of beauty or of intelligence; and, in addition, D’Orsay was\nnow deeply in love with her stepmother.",
        "On the other hand, his position with the Blessingtons was daily\ngrowing more difficult. People had begun to talk of the almost\nopen relations between Count d’Orsay and Lady Blessington. Lord\nByron, in a letter written to the countess, spoke to her openly\nand in a playful way of “YOUR D’Orsay.” The manners and morals of\nthe time were decidedly irregular; yet sooner or later the earl\nwas sure to gain some hint of what every one was saying.\nTherefore, much against his real desire, yet in order to shelter\nhis relations with Lady Blessington, D’Orsay agreed to the\nmarriage with Lady Harriet, who was only fifteen years of age.",
        "This made the intimacy between D’Orsay and the Blessingtons appear\nto be not unusual; but, as a matter of fact, the marriage was no\nmarriage. The unattractive girl who had become a bride merely to\nhide the indiscretions of her stepmother was left entirely to\nherself; while the whole family, returning to London, made their\nhome together in Seymour Place.",
        "Could D’Orsay have foreseen the future he would never have done\nwhat must always seem an act so utterly unworthy of him. For\nwithin two years Lord Blessington fell ill and died. Had not\nD’Orsay been married he would now have been free to marry Lady\nBlessington. As it was, he was bound fast to her stepdaughter; and\nsince at that time there was no divorce court in England, and\nsince he had no reason for seeking a divorce, he was obliged to\nlive on through many years in a most ambiguous situation. He did,\nhowever, separate himself from his childish bride; and, having\ndone so, he openly took up his residence with Lady Blessington at\nGore House. By this time, however, the companionship of the two\nhad received a sort of general sanction, and in that easy-going\nage most people took it as a matter of course.",
        "The two were now quite free to live precisely as they would. Lady\nBlessington became extravagantly happy, and Count d’Orsay was\naccepted in London as an oracle of fashion. Every one was eager to\nvisit Gore House, and there they received all the notable men of\nthe time. The improvidence of Lady Blessington, however, was in no\nrespect diminished. She lived upon her jointure, recklessly\nspending capital as well as interest, and gathering under her roof\na rare museum of artistic works, from jewels and curios up to\nmagnificent pictures and beautiful statuary.",
        "D’Orsay had sufficient self-respect not to live upon the money\nthat had come to Lady Blessington from her husband. He was a\nskilful painter, and he practised his art in a professional way.\nHis portrait of the Duke of Wellington was preferred by that\nfamous soldier to any other that had been made of him. The Iron\nDuke was, in fact, a frequent visitor at Gore House, and he had a\nvery high opinion of Count d’Orsay. Lady Blessington herself\nengaged in writing novels of “high life,” some of which were very\npopular in their day. But of all that she wrote there remains only\none book which is of permanent value–her Conversations with Lord\nByron, a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of the\nbrilliant poet.",
        "But a nemesis was destined to overtake the pair. Money flowed\nthrough Lady Blessington’s hands like water, and she could never\nbe brought to understand that what she had might not last for\never. Finally, it was all gone, yet her extravagance continued.\nDebts were heaped up mountain-high. She signed notes of hand\nwithout even reading them. She incurred obligations of every sort\nwithout a moment’s hesitation.",
        "For a long time her creditors held aloof, not believing that her\nresources were in reality exhausted; but in the end there came a\ncrash as sudden as it was ruinous. As if moved by a single\nimpulse, those to whom she owed money took out judgments against\nher and descended upon Gore House in a swarm. This was in the\nspring of 1849, when Lady Blessington was in her sixtieth year and\nD’Orsay fifty-one.",
        "It is a curious coincidence that her earliest novel had portrayed\nthe wreck of a great establishment such as her own. Of the scene\nin Gore House Mr. Madden, Lady Blessington’s literary biographer,\nhas written:",
        "Numerous creditors, bill-discounters, money-lenders, jewelers,\nlace-venders, tax-collectors, gas-company agents, all persons\nhaving claims to urge pressed them at this period simultaneously.\nAn execution for a debt of four thousand pounds was at length put\nin by a house largely engaged in the silk, lace, India-shawl, and\nfancy-jewelry business.",
        "This sum of four thousand pounds was only a nominal claim, but it\nopened the flood-gates for all of Lady Blessington’s creditors.\nMr. Madden writes still further:",
        "On the 10th of May, 1849, I visited Gore House for the last time.\nThe auction was going on. There was a large assemblage of people\nof fashion. Every room was thronged; the well-known library-salon,\nin which the conversaziones took place, was crowded, but not with\nguests. The arm-chair in which the lady of the mansion was wont to\nsit was occupied by a stout, coarse gentleman of the Jewish\npersuasion, busily engaged in examining a marble hand extended on\na book, the fingers of which were modeled from a cast of those of\nthe absent mistress of the establishment. People, as they passed\nthrough the room, poked the furniture, pulled about the precious\nobjects of art and ornaments of various kinds that lay on the\ntable; and some made jests and ribald jokes on the scene they\nwitnessed.",
        "At this compulsory sale things went for less than half their\nvalue. Pictures by Lawrence and Landseer, a library consisting of\nthousands of volumes, vases of exquisite workmanship, chandeliers\nof ormolu, and precious porcelains–all were knocked down\nrelentlessly at farcical prices. Lady Blessington reserved nothing\nfor herself. She knew that the hour had struck, and very soon she\nwas on her way to Paris, whither Count d’Orsay had already gone,\nhaving been threatened with arrest by a boot-maker to whom he owed\nfive hundred pounds.",
        "D’Orsay very naturally went to Paris, for, like his father, he had\nalways been an ardent Bonapartist, and now Prince Louis Bonaparte\nhad been chosen president of the Second French Republic. During\nthe prince’s long period of exile he had been the guest of Count\nd’Orsay, who had helped him both with money and with influence.\nD’Orsay now expected some return for his former generosity. It\ncame, but it came too late. In 1852, shortly after Prince Louis\nassumed the title of emperor, the count was appointed director of\nfine arts; but when the news was brought to him he was already\ndying. Lady Blessington died soon after coming to Paris, before\nthe end of the year 1849.",
        "Comment upon this tangled story is scarcely needed. Yet one may\nquote some sayings from a sort of diary which Lady Blessington\ncalled her “Night Book.” They seem to show that her supreme\nhappiness lasted only for a little while, and that deep down in\nher heart she had condemned herself.",
        "A woman’s head is always influenced by her heart; but a man’s\nheart is always influenced by his head.",
        "The separation of friends by death is less terrible than the\ndivorce of two hearts that have loved, but have ceased to\nsympathize, while memory still recalls what they once were to each\nother.",
        "People are seldom tired of the world until the world is tired of\nthem.",
        "A woman should not paint sentiment until she has ceased to inspire\nit.",
        "It is less difficult for a woman to obtain celebrity by her genius\nthan to be pardoned for it.",
        "Memory seldom fails when its office is to show us the tombs of our\nburied hopes.",
