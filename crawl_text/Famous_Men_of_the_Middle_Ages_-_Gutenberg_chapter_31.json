        "\n\n",
        "While Joan of Arc was busy rescuing France from the English, another\nwonderful worker was busy in Germany.  This was John Gutenberg,\nwho was born in Mainz.",
        "The Germans—and most other people—think that he was the inventor\nof the art of printing with movable types.  And so in the cities of\nDresden and Mainz his countrymen have put up statues in his memory.",
        "Gutenberg’s father was a man of good family.  Very likely the boy\nwas taught to read.  But the books from which he learned were not\nlike ours; they were written by hand.  A better name for them than\nbooks is “manuscripts,” which means “hand-writings.”",
        "While Gutenberg was growing up a new way of making books came into\nuse, which was a great deal better than copying by hand.  It was\nwhat is called block-printing.  The printer first cut a block of\nhard wood the size of the page that he was going to print.  Then he\ncut out every word of the written page upon the smooth face of his\nblock.  This had to be very carefully done.  When it was finished\nthe printer had to cut away the wood from the sides of every\nletter.  This left the letters raised, as the letters are in books\nnow printed for the blind.",
        "The block was now ready to be used.  The letters were inked, paper\nwas laid upon them and pressed down.",
        "With blocks the printer could make copies of a book a great deal\nfaster than a man could write them by hand.  But the making of the\nblocks took a long time, and each block would print only one page.",
        "Gutenberg enjoyed reading the manuscripts and block books that his\nparents and their wealthy friends had; and he often said it was a\npity that only rich people could own books.  Finally he determined\nto contrive some easy and quick way of printing.",
        "He did a great deal of his work in secret, for he thought it was\nmuch better that his neighbors should know nothing of what he was\ndoing.",
        "So he looked for a workshop where no one would be likely to find\nhim.  He was now living in Strasburg, and there was in that city a\nruined old building where, long before his time, a number of monks\nhad lived.  There was one room of the building which needed only a\nlittle repairing to make it fit to be used.  So Gutenberg got the\nright to repair that room and use it as his workshop.",
        "All his neighbors wondered what became of him when he left home in\nthe early morning, and where he had been when they saw him coming\nback late in the twilight.  Some felt sure that he must be a wizard,\nand that he had meetings somewhere with the devil, and that the\ndevil was helping him to do some strange business.",
        "Gutenberg did not care much what people had to say, and in his\nquiet room he patiently tried one experiment after another, often\nfeeling very sad and discouraged day after day because his experiments\ndid not succeed.",
        "At last the time came when he had no money left.  He went back to\nhis old home, Mainz, and there met a rich goldsmith named Fust (or\nFaust).",
        "Gutenberg told him how hard he had tried in Strasburg to find some\nway of making books cheaply, and how he had now no more money to\ncarry on his experiments.  Fust became greatly interested and gave\nGutenberg what money he needed.  But as the experiments did not\nat first succeed Fust lost patience.  He quarreled with Gutenberg\nand said that he was doing nothing but spending money.  At last he\nbrought suit against him in the court, and the judge decided in\nfavor of Fust.  So everything in the world that Gutenberg had, even\nthe tools with which he worked, came into Fust’s possession.",
        "But though he had lost his tools, Gutenberg had not lost his courage.\nAnd he had not lost all his friends.  One of them had money, and he\nbought Gutenberg a new set of tools and hired a workshop for him.\nAnd now at last Gutenberg’s hopes were fulfilled.  First of all it\nis thought that he made types of hard wood.  Each type was a little\nblock with a single letter at one end.  Such types were a great\ndeal better than block letters.  The block letters were fixed.\nThey could not be taken out of the words of which they were parts.\nThe new types were movable so they could be set up to print one\npage, then taken apart and set up again and again to print any\nnumber of pages.",
        "But type made of wood did not always print the letters clearly and\ndistinctly, so Gutenberg gave up wood types and tried metal types.\nSoon a Latin Bible was printed.  It was in two volumes, each of\nwhich had three hundred pages, while each of the pages had forty-two\nlines.  The letters were sharp and clear.  They had been printed\nfrom movable types of metal.",
        "The Dutch claim that Lorenz Coster, a native of Harlem, in the\nNetherlands, was the first person who printed with movable type.\nThey say that Coster was one day taking a walk in a beech forest\nnot far from Harlem, and that he cut bark from one of the trees\nand shaped it with his knife into letters.",
        "Not long after this the Dutch say Coster had made movable types\nand was printing and selling books in Harlem.",
        "The news that books were being printed in Mainz by Gutenberg went\nall over Europe, and before he died printing-presses like his were\nat work making books in all the great cities of the continent.",
        "About twenty years after his death, when Venice was the richest of\nEuropean cities, a man named Aldus (Al’-dus) Manutius (Ma-nu’-tius)\nestablished there the most famous printing house of that time.\nHe was at work printing books two years before Columbus sailed on\nhis first voyage.  The descendents of Aldus continued the business\nafter his death for about one hundred years.  The books published\nby them were called “Aldine,” from Aldus.  They were the most\nbeautiful that had ever come from the press.  They are admired and\nvalued to this day.",
