        "Of course Mary did not waken early the next morning.\nShe slept late because she was tired, and when Martha\nbrought her breakfast she told her that though.\nColin was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as he always\nwas after he had worn himself out with a fit of crying.\nMary ate her breakfast slowly as she listened.",
        "“He says he wishes tha’ would please go and see him as soon\nas tha’ can,” Martha said.  “It’s queer what a fancy\nhe’s took to thee.  Tha’ did give it him last night for\nsure–didn’t tha? Nobody else would have dared to do it.\nEh! poor lad! He’s been spoiled till salt won’t save him.\nMother says as th’ two worst things as can happen to a\nchild is never to have his own way–or always to have it.\nShe doesn’t know which is th’ worst.  Tha’ was in a fine temper\ntha’self, too.  But he says to me when I went into his room,\n`Please ask Miss Mary if she’ll please come an, talk to me?’\nThink o’ him saying please! Will you go, Miss?” “I’ll run\nand see Dickon first,” said Mary.  “No, I’ll go and see\nColin first and tell him–I know what I’ll tell him,\"\nwith a sudden inspiration.",
        "She had her hat on when she appeared in Colin’s room\nand for a second he looked disappointed.  He was in bed.\nHis face was pitifully white and there were dark circles\nround his eyes.",
        "“I’m glad you came,” he said.  “My head aches and I ache\nall over because I’m so tired.  Are you going somewhere?”",
        "Mary went and leaned against his bed.",
        "“I won’t be long,” she said.  “I’m going to Dickon,\nbut I’ll come back.  Colin, it’s–it’s something about\nthe garden.”",
        "His whole face brightened and a little color came into it.",
        "“Oh! is it?” he cried out.  “I dreamed about it all night\nI heard you say something about gray changing into green,\nand I dreamed I was standing in a place all filled\nwith trembling little green leaves–and there were birds\non nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still.\nI’ll lie and think about it until you come back.”",
        "In five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden.\nThe fox and the crow were with him again and this time\nhe had brought two tame squirrels.  “I came over on the\npony this mornin’,” he said.  “Eh! he is a good little\nchap–Jump is! I brought these two in my pockets.\nThis here one he’s called Nut an’ this here other one’s\ncalled Shell.”",
        "When he said “Nut” one squirrel leaped on to his right\nshoulder and when he said “Shell” the other one leaped\non to his left shoulder.",
        "When they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at\ntheir feet, Soot solemnly listening on a tree and Nut and\nShell nosing about close to them, it seemed to Mary that it\nwould be scarcely bearable to leave such delightfulness,\nbut when she began to tell her story somehow the look\nin Dickon’s funny face gradually changed her mind.\nShe could see he felt sorrier for Colin than she did.\nHe looked up at the sky and all about him.",
        "“Just listen to them birds–th’ world seems full\nof ’em–all whistlin’ an’ pipin’,” he said.\n“Look at ’em dartin’ about, an’ hearken at ’em callin’\nto each other.  Come springtime seems like as if all th’\nworld’s callin’. The leaves is uncurlin’ so you can see\n’em–an’, my word, th’ nice smells there is about!\"\nsniffing with his happy turned-up nose.  “An’ that poor\nlad lyin’ shut up an’ seein’ so little that he gets\nto thinkin’ o’ things as sets him screamin’. Eh! my!\nwe mun get him out here–we mun get him watchin’\nan listenin’ an’ sniffin’ up th’ air an’ get him just soaked\nthrough wi’ sunshine.  An’ we munnot lose no time about it.”",
        "When he was very much interested he often spoke quite\nbroad Yorkshire though at other times he tried to modify\nhis dialect so that Mary could better understand.\nBut she loved his broad Yorkshire and had in fact been\ntrying to learn to speak it herself.  So she spoke\na little now.",
        "“Aye, that we mun,” she said (which meant “Yes, indeed,\nwe must”). “I’ll tell thee what us’ll do first,” she proceeded,\nand Dickon grinned, because when the little wench tried\nto twist her tongue into speaking Yorkshire it amused\nhim very much.  “He’s took a graidely fancy to thee.\nHe wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot an’ Captain.\nWhen I go back to the house to talk to him I’ll ax him\nif tha’ canna’ come an’ see him tomorrow mornin’–an’.\nbring tha’ creatures wi’ thee–an’ then–in a bit,\nwhen there’s more leaves out, an’ happen a bud or two,\nwe’ll get him to come out an’ tha’ shall push him in his\nchair an’ we’ll bring him here an’ show him everything.”",
        "When she stopped she was quite proud of herself.\nShe had never made a long speech in Yorkshire before\nand she had remembered very well.",
        "“Tha’ mun talk a bit o’ Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,\"\nDickon chuckled.  “Tha’ll make him laugh an’ there’s nowt\nas good for ill folk as laughin’ is.  Mother says she\nbelieves as half a hour’s good laugh every mornin’\n’ud cure a chap as was makin’ ready for typhus fever.”",
        "“I’m going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day,\"\nsaid Mary, chuckling herself.",
        "The garden had reached the time when every day and every night\nit seemed as if Magicians were passing through it drawing\nloveliness out of the earth and the boughs with wands.\nIt was hard to go away and leave it all, particularly as Nut\nhad actually crept on to her dress and Shell had scrambled\ndown the trunk of the apple-tree they sat under and stayed\nthere looking at her with inquiring eyes.  But she went back\nto the house and when she sat down close to Colin’s bed\nhe began to sniff as Dickon did though not in such an experienced\nway.",
        "“You smell like flowers and–and fresh things,” he cried\nout quite joyously.  “What is it you smell of? It’s cool\nand warm and sweet all at the same time.”",
        "“It’s th’ wind from th’ moor,” said Mary.  “It comes o’ sittin’\non th’ grass under a tree wi’ Dickon an’ wi’ Captain an’\nSoot an’ Nut an’ Shell.  It’s th’ springtime an’ out o’\ndoors an’ sunshine as smells so graidely.”",
        "She said it as broadly as she could, and you do not know\nhow broadly Yorkshire sounds until you have heard some\none speak it.  Colin began to laugh.",
        "“What are you doing?” he said.  “I never heard you talk\nlike that before.  How funny it sounds.”",
        "“I’m givin’ thee a bit o’ Yorkshire,” answered Mary triumphantly.\n“I canna’ talk as graidely as Dickon an’ Martha can but tha’\nsees I can shape a bit.  Doesn’t tha’ understand a bit o’\nYorkshire when tha’ hears it? An’ tha’ a Yorkshire lad thysel’\nbred an’ born! Eh! I wonder tha’rt not ashamed o’\nthy face.”",
        "And then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until\nthey could not stop themselves and they laughed until\nthe room echoed and Mrs. Medlock opening the door to come\nin drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed.",
        "“Well, upon my word!” she said, speaking rather broad\nYorkshire herself because there was no one to hear\nher and she was so astonished.  “Whoever heard th’\nlike! Whoever on earth would ha’ thought it!”",
        "There was so much to talk about.  It seemed as if Colin\ncould never hear enough of Dickon and Captain and Soot\nand Nut and Shell and the pony whose name was Jump.\nMary had run round into the wood with Dickon to see Jump.\nHe was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks\nhanging over his eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling\nvelvet nose.  He was rather thin with living on moor\ngrass but he was as tough and wiry as if the muscle\nin his little legs had been made of steel springs.\nHe had lifted his head and whinnied softly the moment\nhe saw Dickon and he had trotted up to him and put his\nhead across his shoulder and then Dickon had talked into\nhis ear and Jump had talked back in odd little whinnies\nand puffs and snorts.  Dickon had made him give Mary\nhis small front hoof and kiss her on her cheek with his\nvelvet muzzle.",
        "“Does he really understand everything Dickon says?\"\nColin asked.",
        "“It seems as if he does,” answered Mary.  “Dickon says\nanything will understand if you’re friends with it for sure,\nbut you have to be friends for sure.”",
        "Colin lay quiet a little while and his strange gray\neyes seemed to be staring at the wall, but Mary saw\nhe was thinking.",
        "“I wish I was friends with things,” he said at last,\n“but I’m not.  I never had anything to be friends with,\nand I can’t bear people.”",
        "“Can’t you bear me?” asked Mary.",
        "“Yes, I can,” he answered.  “It’s funny but I even like you.”",
        "“Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him,” said Mary.\n“He said he’d warrant we’d both got the same nasty tempers.\nI think you are like him too.  We are all three alike–you\nand I and Ben Weatherstaff.  He said we were neither\nof us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked.\nBut I don’t feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin\nand Dickon.”",
        "“Did you feel as if you hated people?”",
        "“Yes,” answered Mary without any affectation.\n“I should have detested you if I had seen you before\nI saw the robin and Dickon.”",
        "Colin put out his thin hand and touched her.",
        "“Mary,” he said, “I wish I hadn’t said what I did about\nsending Dickon away.  I hated you when you said he was\nlike an angel and I laughed at you but–but perhaps he is.”",
        "“Well, it was rather funny to say it,” she admitted frankly,\n“because his nose does turn up and he has a big mouth\nand his clothes have patches all over them and he talks\nbroad Yorkshire, but–but if an angel did come to Yorkshire\nand live on the moor–if there was a Yorkshire angel–I\nbelieve he’d understand the green things and know how to\nmake them grow and he would know how to talk to the wild\ncreatures as Dickon does and they’d know he was friends for\nsure.”",
        "“I shouldn’t mind Dickon looking at me,” said Colin;\n“I want to see him.”",
        "“I’m glad you said that,” answered Mary, “because–because–”",
        "Quite suddenly it came into her mind that this was the\nminute to tell him.  Colin knew something new was coming.",
        "“Because what?” he cried eagerly.",
        "Mary was so anxious that she got up from her stool\nand came to him and caught hold of both his hands.",
        "“Can I trust you? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him.\nCan I trust you–for sure–for sure?” she implored.",
        "Her face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer.",
        "“Yes–yes!”",
        "“Well, Dickon will come to see you tomorrow morning,\nand he’ll bring his creatures with him.”",
        "“Oh! Oh!” Colin cried out in delight.",
        "“But that’s not all,” Mary went on, almost pale with\nsolemn excitement.  “The rest is better.  There is a door\ninto the garden.  I found it.  It is under the ivy on the wall.”",
        "If he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably\nhave shouted “Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!” but he was weak\nand rather hysterical; his eyes grew bigger and bigger\nand he gasped for breath.",
        "“Oh! Mary!” he cried out with a half sob.  “Shall I see\nit? Shall I get into it? Shall I live to get into it?\"\nand he clutched her hands and dragged her toward him.",
        "“Of course you’ll see it!” snapped Mary indignantly.\n“Of course you’ll live to get into it! Don’t be silly!”",
        "And she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish\nthat she brought him to his senses and he began to laugh\nat himself and a few minutes afterward she was sitting\non her stool again telling him not what she imagined\nthe secret garden to be like but what it really was,\nand Colin’s aches and tiredness were forgotten and he\nwas listening enraptured.",
        "“It is just what you thought it would be,” he said at last.\n“It sounds just as if you had really seen it.  You know I\nsaid that when you told me first.”",
        "Mary hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke\nthe truth.",
        "“I had seen it–and I had been in,” she said.  “I found\nthe key and got in weeks ago.  But I daren’t tell you–I\ndaren’t because I was so afraid I couldn’t trust you–for sure!”",
