        "Their sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt\nfor her probably more than she felt for herself.  The carriage\nwas sent to meet them at ––, and they were to return in it\nby dinner-time.  Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss\nBennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings\nwhich would have attended herself, had she been the culprit,\nand was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.",
        "They came.  The family were assembled in the breakfast room to\nreceive them.  Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the\ncarriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably\ngrave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.",
        "Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown\nopen, and she ran into the room.  Her mother stepped forwards,\nembraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand,\nwith an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady;\nand wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt\nof their happiness.",
        "Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was\nnot quite so cordial.  His countenance rather gained in austerity;\nand he scarcely opened his lips.  The easy assurance of the\nyoung couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.  Elizabeth was\ndisgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.  Lydia was Lydia\nstill; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.  She turned\nfrom sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when\nat length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took\nnotice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a\nlaugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.",
        "Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his\nmanners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his\nmarriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy\naddress, while he claimed their relationship, would have\ndelighted them all.  Elizabeth had not before believed him\nquite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving\nwithin herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of\nan impudent man.  She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no\nvariation of colour.",
        "There was no want of discourse.  The bride and her mother could\nneither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to\nsit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in\nthat neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt\nvery unable to equal in her replies.  They seemed each of them\nto have the happiest memories in the world.  Nothing of the\npast was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to\nsubjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the\nworld.",
        "“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I\nwent away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there\nhave been things enough happened in the time.  Good gracious!\nwhen I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married\ntill I came back again! though I thought it would be very good\nfun if I was.”",
        "Her father lifted up his eyes.  Jane was distressed.  Elizabeth\nlooked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw\nanything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,\n“Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married\nto-day?  I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William\nGoulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know\nit, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off\nmy glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so\nthat he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like\nanything.”",
        "Elizabeth could bear it no longer.  She got up, and ran out of\nthe room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing\nthrough the hall to the dining parlour.  She then joined them\nsoon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her\nmother’s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,\n“Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower,\nbecause I am a married woman.”",
        "It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that\nembarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\nHer ease and good spirits increased.  She longed to see Mrs.\nPhillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to\nhear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by each of them; and in the\nmean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast\nof being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.",
        "“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the\nbreakfast room, “and what do you think of my husband?  Is not\nhe a charming man?  I am sure my sisters must all envy me.  I\nonly hope they may have half my good luck.  They must all go to\nBrighton.  That is the place to get husbands.  What a pity it\nis, mamma, we did not all go.”",
        "“Very true; and if I had my will, we should.  But my dear\nLydia, I don’t at all like your going such a way off.  Must\nit be so?”",
        "“Oh, lord! yes;–there is nothing in that.  I shall like it\nof all things.  You and papa, and my sisters, must come down\nand see us.  We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I\ndare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get\ngood partners for them all.”",
        "“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.",
        "“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my\nsisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for\nthem before the winter is over.”",
        "“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth;\n“but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.”",
        "Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.\nMr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London,\nand he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.",
        "No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so\nshort; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with\nher daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.  These\nparties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was\neven more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.",
        "Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had\nexpected to find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him.  She had\nscarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from\nthe reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on\nby the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would\nhave wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose\nto elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his\nflight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances;\nand if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist\nan opportunity of having a companion.",
        "Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.  He was her dear Wickham on\nevery occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.\nHe did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would\nkill more birds on the first of September, than any body else\nin the country.",
        "One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with\nher two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:",
        "“Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe.\nYou were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\nAre not you curious to hear how it was managed?”",
        "“No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too\nlittle said on the subject.”",
        "“La!  You are so strange!  But I must tell you how it went off.\nWe were married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s\nlodgings were in that parish.  And it was settled that we\nshould all be there by eleven o’clock.  My uncle and aunt and\nI were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the\nchurch.  Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!\nI was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put\nit off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.  And\nthere was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and\ntalking away just as if she was reading a sermon.  However, I\ndid not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may\nsuppose, of my dear Wickham.  I longed to know whether he would\nbe married in his blue coat.”",
        "“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it\nwould never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand,\nthat my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I\nwas with them.  If you’ll believe me, I did not once put my\nfoot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.  Not one\nparty, or scheme, or anything.  To be sure London was rather\nthin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.  Well, and so\njust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away\nupon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.  And then, you\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it.\nWell, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my\nuncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we\ncould not be married all day.  But, luckily, he came back again\nin ten minutes’ time, and then we all set out.  However, I\nrecollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going,\nthe wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done\nas well.”",
        "“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.",
        "“Oh, yes!–he was to come there with Wickham, you know.  But\ngracious me!  I quite forgot!  I ought not to have said a word\nabout it.  I promised them so faithfully!  What will Wickham\nsay?  It was to be such a secret!”",
        "“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on\nthe subject.  You may depend upon my seeking no further.”",
        "“Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity;\n“we will ask you no questions.”",
        "“Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly\ntell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.”",
        "On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it\nout of her power, by running away.",
        "But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at\nleast it was impossible not to try for information.  Mr. Darcy\nhad been at her sister’s wedding.  It was exactly a scene, and\nexactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and\nleast temptation to go.  Conjectures as to the meaning of it,\nrapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied\nwith none.  Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct\nin the noblest light, seemed most improbable.  She could not\nbear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote\na short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which\nhad been intended.",
        "“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity\nmust be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and\n(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have\nbeen amongst you at such a time.  Pray write instantly, and\nlet me understand it–unless it is, for very cogent reasons,\nto remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary;\nand then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.”",
        "“Not that I shall, though,” she added to herself, as she\nfinished the letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me\nin an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks\nand stratagems to find it out.”",
        "Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was\nglad of it;–till it appeared whether her inquiries would\nreceive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.",
