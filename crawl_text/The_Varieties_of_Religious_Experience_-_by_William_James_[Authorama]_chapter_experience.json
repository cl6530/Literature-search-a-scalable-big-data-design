        "This book would never have been written had I not been honored\nwith an appointment as Gifford Lecturer on Natural Religion at\nthe University of Edinburgh.  In casting about me for subjects of\nthe two courses of ten lectures each for which I thus became\nresponsible, it seemed to me that the first course might well be\na descriptive one on “Man’s Religious Appetites,” and the second\na metaphysical one on “Their Satisfaction through Philosophy.”   \nBut the unexpected growth of the psychological matter as I came\nto write it out has resulted in the second subject being\npostponed entirely, and the description of man’s religious\nconstitution now fills the twenty lectures.  In Lecture XX I have\nsuggested rather than stated my own philosophic conclusions, and\nthe reader who desires immediately to know them should turn to \npages 501-509, and to the “Postscript” of the book. I hope to be\nable at some later day to express them in more explicit form.",
        "In my belief that a large acquaintance with particulars often\nmakes us wiser than the possession of abstract formulas, however\ndeep, I have loaded the lectures with concrete examples, and I\nhave chosen these among the extremer expressions of the religious\ntemperament.  To some readers I may consequently seem, before\nthey get beyond the middle of the book, to offer a caricature of\nthe subject.  Such convulsions of piety, they will say, are not\nsane.  If, however, they will have the patience to read to the\nend, I believe that this unfavorable impression will disappear;\nfor I there combine the religious impulses with other principles\nof common sense which serve as correctives of exaggeration, and\nallow the individual reader to draw as moderate conclusions as he\nwill.",
        "My thanks for help in writing these lectures are due to Edwin D.\nStarbuck, of Stanford University, who made over to me his large\ncollection of manuscript material; to Henry W. Rankin, of East\nNorthfield, a friend unseen but proved, to whom I owe precious\ninformation; to Theodore Flournoy, of Geneva, to Canning Schiller\nof Oxford, and to my colleague Benjamin Rand, for documents; to\nmy colleague Dickinson S. Miller, and to my friends, Thomas Wren\nWard, of New York, and Wincenty Lutoslawski, late of Cracow, for\nimportant suggestions and advice.  Finally, to conversations with\nthe lamented Thomas Davidson and to the use of his books, at\nGlenmore, above Keene Valley, I owe more obligations than I can\nwell express.      \nHarvard University,\nMarch, 1902.",
        "It is with no small amount of trepidation that I take my place\nbehind this desk, and face this learned audience.  To us\nAmericans, the experience of receiving instruction from the\nliving voice, as well as from the books, of European scholars, is\nvery familiar.  At my own University of Harvard, not a winter\npasses without its harvest, large or small, of lectures from\nScottish, English, French, or German representatives of the\nscience or literature of their respective countries whom we have\neither induced to cross the ocean to address us, or captured on\nthe wing as they were visiting our land.  It seems the natural\nthing for us to listen whilst the Europeans talk.  The contrary\nhabit, of talking whilst the Europeans listen, we have not yet\nacquired; and in him who first makes the adventure it begets a\ncertain sense of apology being due for so presumptuous an act. \nParticularly must this be the case on a soil as sacred to the\nAmerican imagination as that of Edinburgh.  The glories of the\nphilosophic chair of this university were deeply impressed on my\nimagination in boyhood.  Professor Fraser’s Essays in Philosophy,\nthen just published, was the first philosophic book I ever looked\ninto, and I well remember the awestruck feeling I received from\nthe account of Sir William Hamilton’s classroom therein\ncontained.  Hamilton’s own lectures were the first philosophic\nwritings I ever forced myself to study, and after that I was\nimmersed in Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown.  Such juvenile\nemotions of reverence never get outgrown; and I confess that to\nfind my humble self promoted from my native wilderness to be\nactually for the time an official here, and transmuted into a\ncolleague of these illustrious names, carries with it a sense of\ndreamland quite as much as of reality.",
        "But since I have received the honor of this appointment I have\nfelt that it would never do to decline.  The academic career also\nhas its heroic obligations, so I stand here without further\ndeprecatory words.  Let me say only this, that now that the\ncurrent, here and at Aberdeen, has begun to run from west to\neast, I hope it may continue to do so.  As the years go by, I\nhope that many of my countrymen may be asked to lecture in the\nScottish universities, changing places with Scotsmen lecturing in\nthe United States; I hope that our people may become in all these\nhigher matters even as one people; and that the peculiar\nphilosophic temperament, as well as the peculiar political\ntemperament, that goes with our English speech may more and more\npervade and influence the world.",
        "As regards the manner in which I shall have to administer this\nlectureship, I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in\nthe history of religions, nor an anthropologist.  Psychology is\nthe only branch of learning in which I am particularly versed. \nTo the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at\nleast as interesting as any other of the facts pertaining to his\nmental constitution.  It would seem, therefore, that, as a\npsychologist, the natural thing for me would be to invite you to\na descriptive survey of those religious propensities.",
        "If the inquiry be psychological, not religious institutions, but\nrather religious feelings and religious impulses must be its\nsubject, and I must confine myself to those more developed\nsubjective phenomena recorded in literature produced by\narticulate and fully self-conscious men, in works of piety and\nautobiography.  Interesting as the origins and early stages of a\nsubject always are, yet when one seeks earnestly for its full\nsignificance, one must always look to its more completely evolved\nand perfect forms.  It follows from this that the documents that\nwill most concern us will be those of the men who were most\naccomplished in the religious life and best able to give an\nintelligible account of their ideas and motives.  These men, of\ncourse, are either comparatively modern writers, or else such\nearlier ones as have become religious classics.  The documents\nhumains which we shall find most instructive need not then be\nsought for in the haunts of special erudition–they lie along the\nbeaten highway; and this circumstance, which flows so naturally\nfrom the character of our problem, suits admirably also your\nlecturer’s lack of special theological learning. I may take\nmy citations, my sentences and paragraphs of personal confession,\nfrom books that most of you at some time will have had already in\nyour hands, and yet this will be no detriment to the value of my\nconclusions.  It is true that some more adventurous reader and\ninvestigator, lecturing here in future, may unearth from the\nshelves of libraries documents that will make a more delectable\nand curious entertainment to listen to than mine.  Yet I doubt\nwhether he will necessarily, by his control of so much more\nout-of-the-way material, get much closer to the essence of the\nmatter in hand.",
        "The question, What are the religious propensities?  and the\nquestion, What is their philosophic significance?  are two\nentirely different orders of question from the logical point of\nview; and, as a failure to recognize this fact distinctly may\nbreed confusion, I wish to insist upon the point a little before\nwe enter into the documents and materials to which I have\nreferred.",
        "In recent books on logic, distinction is made between two orders\nof inquiry concerning anything.  First, what is the nature of it?\nhow did it come about?  what is its constitution, origin, and\nhistory?  And second, What is its importance, meaning, or\nsignificance, now that it is once here? The answer to the one\nquestion is given in an existential judgment or proposition.  The\nanswer to the other is a proposition of value, what the Germans\ncall a Werthurtheil, or what we may, if we like, denominate a\nspiritual judgment.  Neither judgment can be deduced immediately\nfrom the other.  They proceed from diverse intellectual\npreoccupations, and the mind combines them only by making them\nfirst separately, and then adding them together.",
        "In the matter of religions it is particularly easy to distinguish\nthe two orders of question.  Every religious phenomenon has its\nhistory and its derivation from natural antecedents.  What is\nnowadays called the higher criticism of the Bible is only a study\nof the Bible from this existential point of view, neglected too\nmuch by the earlier church.  Under just what biographic\nconditions did the sacred writers bring forth their various\ncontributions to the holy volume?  And what had they exactly in\ntheir several individual minds, when they delivered their\nutterances?  These are manifestly questions of historical fact,\nand one does not see how the answer to them can decide offhand\nthe still further question: of what use should such a volume,\nwith its manner of coming into existence so defined, be to us as\na guide to life and a revelation?  To answer this other question\nwe must have already in our mind some sort of a general theory as\nto what the peculiarities in a thing should be which give it\nvalue for purposes of revelation; and this theory itself would be\nwhat I just called a spiritual judgment.  Combining it with our\nexistential judgment, we might indeed deduce another spiritual\njudgment as to the Bible’s worth.  Thus if our theory of\nrevelation-value were to affirm that any book, to possess it,\nmust have been composed automatically or not by the free caprice\nof the writer, or that it must exhibit no scientific and historic\nerrors and express no local or personal passions, the Bible would\nprobably fare ill at our hands.  But if, on the other hand, our\ntheory should allow that a book may well be a revelation in spite\nof errors and passions and deliberate human composition, if only\nit be a true record of the inner experiences of great-souled\npersons wrestling with the crises of their fate, then the verdict\nwould be much more favorable.  You see that the existential facts\nby themselves are insufficient for determining the value; and the\nbest adepts of the higher criticism accordingly never confound\nthe existential with the spiritual problem.  With the same\nconclusions of fact before them, some take one view, and some\nanother, of the Bible’s value as a revelation, according as their\nspiritual judgment as to the foundation of values differs.",
        "I make these general remarks about the two sorts of judgment,\nbecause there are many religious persons–some of you now\npresent, possibly, are among them–who do not yet make a working\nuse of the distinction, and who may therefore feel first a little\nstartled at the purely existential point of view from which in\nthe following lectures the phenomena of religious experience must\nbe considered.  When I handle them biologically and\npsychologically as if they were mere curious facts of individual\nhistory, some of you may think it a degradation of so sublime a\nsubject, and may even suspect me, until my purpose gets more\nfully expressed, of deliberately seeking to discredit the\nreligious side of life.",
        "Such a result is of course absolutely alien to my intention; and\nsince such a prejudice on your part would seriously obstruct the\ndue effect of much of what I have to relate, I will devote a few\nmore words to the point.",
        "There can be no doubt that as a matter of fact a religious life,\nexclusively pursued, does tend to make the person exceptional and\neccentric.  I speak not now of your ordinary religious believer,\nwho follows the conventional observances of his country, whether\nit be Buddhist, Christian, or Mohammedan.  His religion has been\nmade for him by others, communicated to him by tradition,\ndetermined to fixed forms by imitation, and retained by habit. \nIt would profit us little to study this second-hand religious\nlife.  We must make search rather for the original experiences\nwhich were the pattern-setters to all this mass of suggested\nfeeling and imitated conduct.  These experiences we can only find\nin individuals for whom religion exists not as a dull habit, but\nas an acute fever rather.  But such individuals are “geniuses” in\nthe religious line; and like many other geniuses who have brought\nforth fruits effective enough for commemoration in the pages of\nbiography, such religious geniuses have often shown symptoms of\nnervous instability.  Even more perhaps than other kinds of\ngenius, religious leaders have been subject to abnormal psychical\nvisitations.  Invariably they have been creatures of exalted\nemotional sensibility.  Often they have led a discordant inner\nlife, and had melancholy during a part of their career.  They\nhave known no measure, been liable to obsessions and fixed ideas;\nand frequently they have fallen into trances, heard voices, seen\nvisions, and presented all sorts of peculiarities which are\nordinarily classed as pathological.  Often, moreover, these\npathological features in their career have helped to give them\ntheir religious authority and influence.",
        "If you ask for a concrete example, there can be no better one\nthan is furnished by the person of George Fox.  The Quaker\nreligion which he founded is something which it is impossible to\noverpraise.  In a day of shams, it was a religion of veracity\nrooted in spiritual inwardness, and a return to something more\nlike the original gospel truth than men had ever known in\nEngland.  So far as our Christian sects today are evolving into\nliberality, they are simply reverting in essence to the position\nwhich Fox and the early Quakers so long ago assumed.  No one can\npretend for a moment that in point of spiritual sagacity and\ncapacity, Fox’s mind was unsound.  Everyone who confronted him\npersonally, from Oliver Cromwell down to county magistrates and\njailers, seems to have acknowledged his superior power.  Yet from\nthe point of view of his nervous constitution, Fox was a\npsychopath or detraque of the deepest dye.  His Journal abounds\nin entries of this sort:–",
        "“As I was walking with several friends, I lifted up my head and\nsaw three steeple-house spires, and they struck at my life.  I\nasked them what place that was?  They said, Lichfield. \nImmediately the word of the Lord came to me, that I must go\nthither.  Being come to the house we were going to, I wished the\nfriends to walk into the house, saying nothing to them of whither\nI was to go.  As soon as they were gone I stept away, and went by\nmy eye over hedge and ditch till I came within a mile of\nLichfield where, in a great field, shepherds were keeping their\nsheep.  Then was I commanded by the Lord to pull off my shoes.  I\nstood still, for it was winter: but the word of the Lord was like\na fire in me.  So I put off my shoes and left them with the\nshepherds; and the poor shepherds trembled, and were astonished.\nThen I walked on about a mile, and as soon as I was got within\nthe city, the word of the Lord came to me again, saying: Cry, ’Wo\nto the bloody city of Lichfield!’ So I went up and down the\nstreets, crying with a loud voice, Wo to the bloody city of\nLichfield!  It being market day, I went into the market-place,\nand to and fro in the several parts of it, and made stands,\ncrying as before, Wo to the bloody city of Lichfield!  And no one\nlaid hands on me.  As I went thus crying through the streets,\nthere seemed to me to be a channel of blood running down the\nstreets, and the market-place appeared like a pool of blood. When\nI had declared what was upon me, and felt myself clear, I went\nout of the town in peace; and returning to the shepherds gave\nthem some money, and took my shoes of them again.  But the fire\nof the Lord was so on my feet, and all over me, that I did not\nmatter to put on my shoes again, and was at a stand whether I\nshould or no, till I felt freedom from the Lord so to do: then,\nafter I had washed my feet, I put on my shoes again. After this a\ndeep consideration came upon me, for what reason I should be sent\nto cry against that city, and call it The bloody city!  For\nthough the parliament had the minister one while, and the king\nanother, and much blood had been shed in the town during the wars\nbetween them, yet there was no more than had befallen many other\nplaces.  But afterwards I came to understand, that in the Emperor\nDiocletian’s time a thousand Christians were martyr’d in\nLichfield.  So I was to go, without my shoes, through the\nchannel of their blood, and into the pool of their blood in the\nmarket-place, that I might raise up the memorial of the blood of\nthose martyrs, which had been shed above a thousand years before,\nand lay cold in their streets.  So the sense of this blood was\nupon me, and I obeyed the word of the Lord.”",
        "Bent as we are on studying religion’s existential conditions, we\ncannot possibly ignore these pathological aspects of the subject.",
        "We must describe and name them just as if they occurred in\nnon-religious men.  It is true that we instinctively recoil from\nseeing an object to which our emotions and affections are\ncommitted handled by the intellect as any other object is\nhandled.  The first thing the intellect does with an object is to\nclass it along with something else.  But any object that is\ninfinitely important to us and awakens our devotion feels to us\nalso as if it must be sui generis and unique.  Probably a crab\nwould be filled with a sense of personal outrage if it could hear\nus class it without ado or apology as a crustacean, and thus\ndispose of it.  “I am no such thing, it would say; I am MYSELF,\nMYSELF alone.",
        "The next thing the intellect does is to lay bare the causes in\nwhich the thing originates.  Spinoza says: “I will analyze the\nactions and appetites of men as if it were a question of lines,\nof planes, and of solids.”  And elsewhere he remarks that he\nwill consider our passions and their properties with the same eye\nwith which he looks on all other natural things, since the\nconsequences of our affections flow from their nature with the\nsame necessity as it results from the nature of a triangle that\nits three angles should be equal to two right angles.  Similarly\nM. Taine, in the introduction to his history of English\nliterature, has written: “Whether facts be moral or physical, it\nmakes no matter.  They always have their causes.  There are\ncauses for ambition, courage, veracity, just as there are for\ndigestion, muscular movement, animal heat.  Vice and virtue are\nproducts like vitriol and sugar.”  When we read such\nproclamations of the intellect bent on showing the existential\nconditions of absolutely everything, we feel–quite apart from\nour legitimate impatience at the somewhat ridiculous swagger of\nthe program, in view of what the authors are actually able to\nperform–menaced and negated in the springs of our innermost\nlife.  Such cold-blooded assimilations threaten, we think, to\nundo our soul’s vital secrets, as if the same breath which should\nsucceed in explaining their origin would simultaneously explain\naway their significance, and make them appear of no more\npreciousness, either, than the useful groceries of which M. Taine\nspeaks.",
        "Perhaps the commonest expression of this assumption that\nspiritual value is undone if lowly origin be asserted is seen in\nthose comments which unsentimental people so often pass on their\nmore sentimental acquaintances.  Alfred believes in immortality\nso strongly because his temperament is so emotional.  Fanny’s\nextraordinary conscientiousness is merely a matter of\noverinstigated nerves.  William’s melancholy about the universe\nis due to bad digestion–probably his liver is torpid.  Eliza’s\ndelight in her church is a symptom of her hysterical\nconstitution.  Peter would be less troubled about his soul if he\nwould take more exercise in the open air, etc.  A more fully\ndeveloped example of the same kind of reasoning is the fashion,\nquite common nowadays among certain writers, of criticizing the\nreligious emotions by showing a connection between them and the\nsexual life.  Conversion is a crisis of puberty and adolescence. \nThe macerations of saints, and the devotion of missionaries, are\nonly instances of the parental instinct of self-sacrifice gone\nastray.  For the hysterical nun, starving for natural life,\nChrist is but an imaginary substitute for a more earthly object\nof affection. And the like.[1]",
        "[1]  As with many ideas that float in the air of one’s time, this\nnotion shrinks from dogmatic general statement and expresses\nitself only partially and by innuendo.  It seems to me that few\nconceptions are less instructive than this re-interpretation of\nreligion as perverted sexuality.  It reminds one, so crudely is\nit often employed, of the famous Catholic taunt, that the\nReformation may be best understood by remembering that its fons\net origo was Luther’s wish to marry a nun:–the effects are\ninfinitely wider than the alleged causes, and for the most part\nopposite in nature.  It is true that in the vast collection of\nreligious phenomena, some are undisguisedly amatory–e.g.,\nsex-deities and obscene rites in polytheism, and ecstatic\nfeelings of union with the Savior in a few Christian mystics. \nBut then why not equally call religion an aberration of the\ndigestive function, and prove one’s point by the worship of\nBacchus and Ceres, or by the ecstatic feelings of some other\nsaints about the Eucharist?  Religious language clothes itself in\nsuch poor symbols as our life affords, and the whole organism\ngives overtones of comment whenever the mind is strongly stirred\nto expression.  Language drawn from eating and drinking is\nprobably as common in religious literature as is language drawn\nfrom the sexual life.  We “hunger and thirst” after\nrighteousness; we “find the Lord a sweet savor;” we “taste and\nsee that he is good.”  “Spiritual milk for American babes, drawn\nfrom the breasts of both testaments,” is a sub-title of the once\nfamous New England Primer, and Christian devotional literature\nindeed quite floats in milk, thought of from the point of view,\nnot of the mother, but of the greedy babe.",
        "Saint Francois de Sales, for instance, thus describes the “orison\nof quietude”:  “In this state the soul is like a little child\nstill at the breast, whose mother to caress him whilst he is\nstill in her arms makes her milk distill into his mouth without\nhis even moving his lips.  So it is here. . . . Our Lord desires\nthat our will should be satisfied with sucking the milk which His\nMajesty pours into our mouth, and that we should relish the\nsweetness without even knowing that it cometh from the Lord.”   \nAnd again:  “Consider the little infants, united and joined to\nthe breasts of their nursing mothers you will see that from time\nto time they press themselves closer by little starts to which\nthe pleasure of sucking prompts them.  Even so, during its\norison, the heart united to its God oftentimes makes attempts at\ncloser union by movements during which it presses closer upon the\ndivine sweetness.”  Chemin de la Perfection, ch. xxxi.; Amour de\nDieu, vii. ch. i.",
        "In fact, one might almost as well interpret religion as a\nperversion of the respiratory function.  The Bible is full of the\nlanguage of respiratory oppression:  “Hide not thine ear at my\nbreathing; my groaning is not hid from thee; my heart panteth, my\nstrength faileth me; my bones are hot with my roaring all the\nnight long; as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so my\nsoul panteth after thee, O my God:”  God’s Breath in Man is the\ntitle of the chief work of our best known American mystic (Thomas\nLake Harris), and in certain non-Christian countries the\nfoundation of all religious discipline consists in regulation of\nthe inspiration and expiration.",
        "These arguments are as good as much of the reasoning one hears in\nfavor of the sexual theory.  But the champions of the latter will\nthen say that their chief argument has no analogue elsewhere. \nThe two main phenomena of religion, namely, melancholy and\nconversion, they will say, are essentially phenomena of\nadolescence, and therefore synchronous with the development of\nsexual life.  To which the retort again is easy.  Even were the\nasserted synchrony unrestrictedly true as a fact (which it is\nnot), it is not only the sexual life, but the entire higher\nmental life which awakens during adolescence.  One might then as\nwell set up the thesis that the interest in mechanics, physics,\nchemistry, logic, philosophy, and sociology, which springs up\nduring adolescent years along with that in poetry and religion,\nis also a perversion of the sexual instinct:–but that would be\ntoo absurd.  Moreover, if the argument from synchrony is to\ndecide, what is to be done with the fact that the religious age\npar excellence would seem to be old age, when the uproar of the\nsexual life is past?",
        "The plain truth is that to interpret religion one must in the end\nlook at the immediate content of the religious consciousness. \nThe moment one does this, one sees how wholly disconnected it is\nin the main from the content of the sexual consciousness. \nEverything about the two things differs, objects, moods,\nfaculties concerned, and acts impelled to.  Any GENERAL\nassimilation is simply impossible: what we find most often is\ncomplete hostility and contrast.  If now the defenders of the\nsex-theory say that this makes no difference to their thesis;\nthat without the chemical contributions which the sex-organs make\nto the blood, the brain would not be nourished so as to carry on\nreligious activities, this final proposition may be true or not\ntrue; but at any rate it has become profoundly uninstructive: we\ncan deduce no consequences from it which help us to interpret\nreligion’s meaning or value.  In this sense the religious life\ndepends just as much upon the spleen, the pancreas, and the\nkidneys as on the sexual apparatus, and the whole theory has lost\nits point in evaporating into a vague general assertion of the\ndependence, SOMEHOW, of the mind upon the body.",
        "We are surely all familiar in a general way with this method of\ndiscrediting states of mind for which we have an antipathy.  We\nall use it to some degree in criticizing persons whose states of\nmind we regard as overstrained.  But when other people criticize\nour own more exalted soul-flights by calling them ’nothing but’\nexpressions of our organic disposition, we feel outraged and\nhurt, for we know that, whatever be our organism’s peculiarities,\nour mental states have their substantive value as revelations of\nthe living truth; and we wish that all this medical materialism\ncould be made to hold its tongue.",
        "Medical materialism seems indeed a good appellation for the too\nsimple-minded system of thought which we are considering. \nMedical materialism finishes up Saint Paul by calling his vision\non the road to Damascus a discharging lesion of the occipital\ncortex, he being an epileptic.  It snuffs out Saint Teresa as an\nhysteric, Saint Francis of Assisi as an hereditary degenerate. \nGeorge Fox’s discontent with the shams of his age, and his pining\nfor spiritual veracity, it treats as a symptom of a disordered\ncolon.  Carlyle’s organ-tones of misery it accounts for by a\ngastro-duodenal catarrh.  All such mental overtensions, it says,\nare, when you come to the bottom of the matter, mere affairs of\ndiathesis (auto-intoxications most probably), due to the\nperverted action of various glands which physiology will yet\ndiscover.  And medical materialism then thinks that the spiritual\nauthority of all such personages is successfully undermined.[2]",
        "[2]  For a first-rate example of medical-materialist reasoning,\nsee an article on “les varietes du Type devot,” by Dr. \nBinet-Sangle, in the Revue de l’Hypnotisme, xiv. 161.",
        "Let us ourselves look at the matter in the largest possible way. \nModern psychology, finding definite psycho-physical connections\nto hold good, assumes as a convenient hypothesis that the\ndependence of mental states upon bodily conditions must be\nthoroughgoing and complete.  If we adopt the assumption, then of\ncourse what medical materialism insists on must be true in a\ngeneral way, if not in every detail:  Saint Paul certainly had\nonce an epileptoid, if not an epileptic seizure; George Fox was\nan hereditary degenerate; Carlyle was undoubtedly\nauto-intoxicated by some organ or other, no matter which–and the\nrest.  But now, I ask you, how can such an existential account of\nfacts of mental history decide in one way or another upon their\nspiritual significance?  According to the general postulate of\npsychology just referred to, there is not a single one of our\nstates of mind, high or low, healthy or morbid, that has not some\norganic process as its condition.  Scientific theories are\norganically conditioned just as much as religious emotions are;\nand if we only knew the facts intimately enough, we should\ndoubtless see “the liver” determining the dicta of the sturdy\natheist as decisively as it does those of the Methodist under\nconviction anxious about his soul.  When it alters in one way the\nblood that percolates it, we get the methodist, when in another\nway, we get the atheist form of mind.  So of all our raptures and\nour drynesses, our longings and pantings, our questions and\nbeliefs.  They are equally organically founded, be they religious\nor of non-religious content.",
        "To plead the organic causation of a religious state of  mind,\nthen, in refutation of its claim to possess superior spiritual\nvalue, is quite illogical and arbitrary, unless one has\nalready worked out in advance some psycho-physical theory\nconnecting spiritual values in general with determinate sorts of\nphysiological change.  Otherwise none of our thoughts and\nfeelings, not even our scientific doctrines, not even our\nDIS-beliefs, could retain any value as revelations of the truth,\nfor every one of them without exception flows from the state of\nits possessor’s body at the time.",
        "It is needless to say that medical materialism draws in point of\nfact no such sweeping skeptical conclusion.  It is sure, just as\nevery simple man is sure, that some states of mind are inwardly\nsuperior to others, and reveal to us more truth, and in this it\nsimply makes use of an ordinary spiritual judgment.  It has no\nphysiological theory of the production of these its favorite\nstates, by which it may accredit them; and its attempt to\ndiscredit the states which it dislikes, by vaguely associating\nthem with nerves and liver, and connecting them with names\nconnoting bodily affliction, is altogether illogical and\ninconsistent.",
        "Let us play fair in this whole matter, and be quite candid with\nourselves and with the facts.  When we think certain states of\nmind superior to others, is it ever because of what we know\nconcerning their organic antecedents?  No! it is always for two\nentirely different reasons.  It is either because we take an\nimmediate delight in them; or else it is because we believe them\nto bring us good consequential fruits for life.  When we speak\ndisparagingly of “feverish fancies,” surely the fever-process as\nsuch is not the ground of our disesteem–for aught we know to the\ncontrary, 103 degrees or 104 degrees Fahrenheit might be a much\nmore favorable temperature for truths to germinate and sprout in,\nthan the more ordinary blood-heat of 97 or 98 degrees.  It is\neither the disagreeableness itself of the fancies, or their\ninability to bear the criticisms of the convalescent hour.  When\nwe praise the thoughts which health brings, health’s peculiar\nchemical metabolisms have nothing to do with determining our\njudgment.  We know in fact almost nothing about these\nmetabolisms.  It is the character of inner happiness in the\nthoughts which stamps them as good, or else their consistency\nwith our other opinions and their serviceability for our needs,\nwhich make them pass for true in our esteem.",
        "Now the more intrinsic and the more remote of these criteria do\nnot always hang together.  Inner happiness and serviceability do\nnot always agree.  What immediately feels most “good” is not\nalways most “true,” when measured by the verdict of the rest of\nexperience.  The difference between Philip drunk and Philip sober\nis the classic instance in corroboration.  If merely “feeling\ngood” could decide, drunkenness would be the supremely valid\nhuman experience.  But its revelations, however acutely\nsatisfying at the moment, are inserted into an environment which\nrefuses to bear them out for any length of time.  The consequence\nof this discrepancy of the two criteria is the uncertainty which\nstill prevails over so many of our spiritual judgments.  There\nare moments of sentimental and mystical experience–we shall\nhereafter hear much of them–that carry an enormous sense of\ninner authority and illumination with them when they come.  But\nthey come seldom, and they do not come to everyone; and the rest\nof life makes either no connection with them, or tends to\ncontradict them more than it confirms them.  Some persons follow\nmore the voice of the moment in these cases, some prefer to be\nguided by the average results.  Hence the sad discordancy of so\nmany of the spiritual judgments of human beings; a discordancy\nwhich will be brought home to us acutely enough before these\nlectures end.",
        "It is, however, a discordancy that can never be resolved by any\nmerely medical test.  A good example of the impossibility of\nholding strictly to the medical tests is seen in the theory of\nthe pathological causation of genius promulgated by recent\nauthors.  “Genius,” said Dr. Moreau, “is but one of the many\nbranches of the neuropathic tree.”  “Genius,” says Dr. Lombroso,\n\"is a symptom of hereditary degeneration of the epileptoid\nvariety, and is allied to moral insanity.”   “Whenever a man’s\nlife,” writes Mr. Nisbet, “is at once sufficiently illustrious\nand recorded with sufficient fullness to be a subject of\nprofitable study, he inevitably falls into the morbid category. .\n. .  And it is worthy of remark that, as a rule, the greater the\ngenius, the greater the unsoundness.\"[3]",

        "Now do these authors, after having succeeded in establishing to\ntheir own satisfaction that the works of genius are fruits of\ndisease, consistently proceed thereupon to impugn the VALUE of\nthe fruits?  Do they deduce a new spiritual judgment from their\nnew doctrine of existential conditions? Do they frankly forbid us\nto admire the productions of genius from now onwards?  and say\noutright that no neuropath can ever be a revealer of new truth?",
        "No! their immediate spiritual instincts are too strong for them\nhere, and hold their own against inferences which, in mere love\nof logical consistency, medical materialism ought to be only too\nglad to draw.  One disciple of the school, indeed, has striven to\nimpugn the value of works of genius in a wholesale way (such\nworks of contemporary art, namely, as he himself is unable to\nenjoy, and they are many) by using medical arguments.[4]  But for\nthe most part the masterpieces are left unchallenged; and the\nmedical line of attack either confines itself to such secular\nproductions as everyone admits to be intrinsically eccentric, or\nelse addresses itself exclusively to religious manifestations. \nAnd then it is because the religious manifestations have been\nalready condemned because the critic dislikes them on internal or\nspiritual grounds.",

        "In the natural sciences and industrial arts it never occurs to\nanyone to try to refute opinions by showing up their author’s\nneurotic constitution.  Opinions here are invariably tested by\nlogic and by experiment, no matter what may be their author’s\nneurological type.  It should be no otherwise with religious\nopinions.  Their value can only be ascertained by spiritual\njudgments directly passed upon them, judgments based on our own\nimmediate feeling primarily; and secondarily on what we can\nascertain of their experiential relations to our moral needs and\nto the rest of what we hold as true.",
        "Immediate luminousness, in short, philosophical reasonableness,\nand moral helpfulness are the only available criteria. Saint\nTeresa might have had the nervous system of the placidest cow,\nand it would not now save her theology, if the trial of the\ntheology by these other tests should show it to be contemptible. \nAnd conversely if her theology can stand these other tests, it\nwill make no difference how hysterical or nervously off her\nbalance Saint Teresa may have been when she was with us here\nbelow.",
        "You see that at bottom we are thrown back upon the general\nprinciples by which the empirical philosophy has always contended\nthat we must be guided in our search for truth.  Dogmatic\nphilosophies have sought for tests for truth which might dispense\nus from appealing to the future. Some direct mark, by noting\nwhich we can be protected immediately and absolutely, now and\nforever, against all mistake–such has been the darling dream of\nphilosophic dogmatists.  It is clear that the ORIGIN of the truth\nwould be an admirable criterion of this sort, if only the various\norigins could be discriminated from one another from this \npoint of view, and the history of dogmatic opinion shows that\norigin has always been a favorite test.  Origin in immediate\nintuition; origin in pontifical authority; origin in supernatural\nrevelation, as by vision, hearing, or unaccountable impression;\norigin in direct possession by a higher spirit, expressing itself\nin prophecy and warning; origin in automatic utterance\ngenerally–these origins have been stock warrants for the truth\nof one opinion after another which we find represented in\nreligious history.  The medical materialists are therefore only\nso many belated dogmatists, neatly turning the tables on their\npredecessors by using the criterion of origin in a destructive\ninstead of an accreditive way.",
        "They are effective with their talk of pathological origin only so\nlong as supernatural origin is pleaded by the other side, and\nnothing but the argument from origin is under discussion.  But\nthe argument from origin has seldom been used alone, for it is\ntoo obviously insufficient.  Dr. Maudsley is perhaps the\ncleverest of the rebutters of supernatural religion on grounds of\norigin.  Yet he finds himself forced to write:–",
        "“What right have we to believe Nature under any obligation to do\nher work by means of complete minds only?  She may find an\nincomplete mind a more suitable instrument for a particular\npurpose.  It is the work that is done, and the quality in the\nworker by which it was done, that is alone of moment; and it may\nbe no great matter from a cosmical standpoint, if in other\nqualities of character he was singularly defective–if indeed he\nwere hypocrite, adulterer, eccentric, or lunatic. . . .  Home we\ncome again, then, to the old and last resort of certitude–namely\nthe common assent of mankind, or of the competent by instruction\nand training among mankind.\"[5]",
        "[5]  H. Maudsley:  Natural Causes and Supernatural Seemings,\n1886, pp. 256, 257.",
        "In other words, not its origin, but THE WAY IN WHICH IT WORKS ON\nTHE WHOLE, is Dr. Maudsley’s final test of a belief.  This is our\nown empiricist criterion; and this criterion the stoutest\ninsisters on supernatural origin have also been forced to use in\nthe end.  Among the visions and messages some have always been\ntoo patently silly, among the trances and convulsive seizures\nsome have been too fruitless for conduct and character, to pass\nthemselves off as significant, still less as divine.  In the\nhistory of Christian mysticism the problem how to discriminate\nbetween such messages and experiences as were really divine\nmiracles, and such others as the demon in his malice was able to\ncounterfeit, thus making the religious person twofold more the\nchild of hell he was before, has always been a difficult one to\nsolve, needing all the sagacity and experience of the best\ndirectors of conscience.  In the end it had to come to our\nempiricist criterion:  By their fruits ye shall know them, not by\ntheir roots.  Jonathan Edwards’s Treatise on Religious Affections\nis an elaborate working out of this thesis.  The ROOTS of a man’s\nvirtue are inaccessible to us.  No appearances whatever are\ninfallible proofs of grace.  Our practice is the only sure\nevidence, even to ourselves, that we are genuinely Christians.",
        "“In forming a judgment of ourselves now,” Edwards writes, we\nshould certainly adopt that evidence which our supreme Judge will\nchiefly make use of when we come to stand before him at the last\nday. . . .  There is not one grace of the Spirit of God, of the\nexistence of which, in any professor of religion, Christian\npractice is not the most decisive evidence. . . .  The degree in\nwhich our experience is productive of practice shows the degree\nin which our experience is spiritual and divine.”",
        "Catholic writers are equally emphatic.  The good dispositions\nwhich a vision, or voice, or other apparent heavenly favor leave\nbehind them are the only marks by which we <22> may be sure they\nare not possible deceptions of the tempter.  Says Saint Teresa:–",
        "“Like imperfect sleep which, instead of giving more strength to\nthe head, doth but leave it the more exhausted, the result of\nmere operations of the imagination is but to weaken the soul.\nInstead of nourishment and energy she reaps only lassitude and\ndisgust:  whereas a genuine heavenly vision yields to her a\nharvest of ineffable spiritual riches, and an admirable renewal\nof bodily strength.  I alleged these reasons to those who so\noften accused my visions of being the work of the enemy of\nmankind and the sport of my imagination. . . .  I showed them the\njewels which the divine hand had left with me:–they were my\nactual dispositions.  All those who knew me saw that I was\nchanged; my confessor bore witness to the fact; this improvement,\npalpable in all respects, far from being hidden, was brilliantly\nevident to all men.  As for myself, it was impossible to believe\nthat if the demon were its author, he could have used, in order\nto lose me and lead me to hell, an expedient so contrary to his\nown interests as that of uprooting my vices, and filling me with\nmasculine courage and other virtues instead, for I saw clearly\nthat a single one of these visions was enough to enrich me with\nall that wealth.\"[6]",

        "I fear I may have made a longer excursus than was necessary, and\nthat fewer words would have dispelled the uneasiness which may\nhave arisen among some of you as I announced my pathological\nprogramme.  At any rate you must all be ready now to judge the\nreligious life by its results exclusively, and I shall assume\nthat the bugaboo of morbid origin will scandalize your piety no\nmore.",
        "Still, you may ask me, if its results are to be the ground of our\nfinal spiritual estimate of a religious phenomenon, why threaten\nus at all with so much existential study of its conditions?  Why\nnot simply leave pathological questions out?",
        "To this I reply in two ways.  First, I say, irrepressible\ncuriosity imperiously leads one on; and I say, secondly, that it\nalways leads to a better understanding of a thing’s significance\nto consider its exaggerations and perversions its equivalents and\nsubstitutes and nearest relatives elsewhere.  Not that we may\nthereby swamp the thing in the wholesale condemnation which we\npass on its inferior congeners, but rather that we may by\ncontrast ascertain the more precisely in what its merits consist,\nby learning at the same time to what particular dangers of\ncorruption it may also be exposed.",
        "Insane conditions have this advantage, that they isolate special\nfactors of the mental life, and enable us to inspect them\nunmasked by their more usual surroundings.  They play the part in\nmental anatomy which the scalpel and the microscope play in the\nanatomy of the body.  To understand a thing rightly we need to\nsee it both out of its environment and in it, and to have\nacquaintance with the whole range of its variations.  The study\nof hallucinations has in this way been for psychologists the key\nto their comprehension of normal sensation, that of illusions has\nbeen the key to the right comprehension of perception.  Morbid\nimpulses and imperative conceptions, “fixed ideas,” so called,\nhave thrown a flood of light on the psychology of the normal\nwill; and obsessions and delusions have performed the same\nservice for that of the normal faculty of belief.",
        "Similarly, the nature of genius has been illuminated by the\nattempts, of which I already made mention, to class it with\npsychopathical phenomena.  Borderland insanity, crankiness,\ninsane temperament, loss of mental balance, psychopathic\ndegeneration (to use a few of the many synonyms by which it has\nbeen called), has certain peculiarities and liabilities which,\nwhen combined with a superior quality of intellect in an\nindividual, make it more probable that he will make his mark and\naffect his age, than if his temperament were less neurotic. \nThere is of course no special affinity between crankiness as such\nand superior intellect,[7] for most psychopaths have feeble\nintellects, and superior intellects more commonly have normal\nnervous systems. But the psychopathic temperament, whatever be\nthe intellect with which it finds itself paired, often brings\nwith it ardor and excitability of character.  The cranky person\nhas extraordinary emotional susceptibility.  He\nis liable to fixed ideas and obsessions.  His conceptions tend to\npass immediately into belief and action; and when he gets a new\nidea, he has no rest till he proclaims it, or in some way “works\nit off.”  “What shall I think of it?” a common person says to\nhimself about a vexed question; but in a “cranky” mind “What must\nI do about it?” is the form the question tends to take.  In the\nautobiography of that high-souled woman, Mrs. Annie Besant, I\nread the following passage:  “Plenty of people wish well to any\ngood cause, but very few care to exert themselves to help it, and\nstill fewer will risk anything in its support.  ’Someone ought to\ndo it, but why should I?’ is the ever reechoed phrase of\nweak-kneed amiability. ’Someone ought to do it, so why not I?’ is\nthe cry of some earnest servant of man, eagerly forward springing\nto face some perilous duty.  Between these two sentences lie\nwhole centuries of moral evolution.”  True enough! and between\nthese two sentences lie also the different destinies of the\nordinary sluggard and the psychopathic man.  Thus, when a\nsuperior intellect and a psychopathic temperament coalesce–as in\nthe endless permutations and combinations of human faculty, they\nare bound to coalesce often enough–in the same individual, we\nhave the best possible condition for the kind of effective genius\nthat gets into the <25> biographical dictionaries.  Such men do\nnot remain mere critics and understanders with their intellect. \nTheir ideas possess them, they inflict them, for better or worse,\nupon their companions or their age.  It is they who get counted\nwhen Messrs. Lombroso, Nisbet, and others invoke statistics to\ndefend their paradox.",
        "[7]  Superior intellect, as Professor Bain has admirably shown,\nseems to consist in nothing so much as in a large development of\nthe faculty of association by similarity.",
        "To pass now to religious phenomena, take the melancholy which, as\nwe shall see, constitutes an essential moment in every complete\nreligious evolution.  Take the happiness which achieved religious\nbelief confers.  Take the trancelike states of insight into truth\nwhich all religious mystics report.[8]  These are each and all of\nthem special cases of kinds of human experience of much wider\nscope.  Religious melancholy, whatever peculiarities it may have\nqua religious, is at any rate melancholy.  Religious happiness is\nhappiness. Religious trance is trance.  And the moment we\nrenounce the absurd notion that a thing is exploded away as soon\nas it is classed with others, or its origin is shown; the moment\nwe agree to stand by experimental results and inner quality, in\njudging of values–who does not see that we are likely to\nascertain the distinctive significance of religious melancholy\nand happiness, or of religious trances, far better by comparing\nthem as conscientiously as we can with other varieties of\nmelancholy, happiness, and trance, than by refusing to consider\ntheir place in any more general series, and treating them as if\nthey were outside of nature’s order altogether?",
        "I hope that the course of these lectures will confirm us in this\nsupposition.  As regards the psychopathic origin of so many\nreligious phenomena, that would not be in the least surprising or\ndisconcerting, even were such phenomena certified from on high to\nbe the most precious of human experiences.  No one organism can\npossibly yield to its owner the whole body of truth.  Few of us\nare not in some way infirm, or even diseased; and our very\ninfirmities help us unexpectedly.  In the psychopathic\ntemperament we have the emotionality which is the sine qua non of\nmoral perception; we have the intensity and tendency to emphasis\nwhich are the essence of practical moral vigor; and we have the\nlove of metaphysics and mysticism which carry one’s interests\nbeyond the surface of the sensible world. What, then, is more\nnatural than that this temperament should introduce one to\nregions of religious truth, to corners of the universe, which\nyour robust Philistine type of nervous system, forever offering\nits biceps to be felt, thumping its breast, and thanking Heaven\nthat it hasn’t a single morbid fiber in its composition, would be\nsure to hide forever from its self-satisfied possessors?",
        "[8]  I may refer to a criticism of the insanity theory of genius\nin the Psychological Review, ii. 287 (1895).",
        "If there were such a thing as inspiration from a higher realm, it\nmight well be that the neurotic temperament would furnish the\nchief condition of the requisite receptivity. And having said\nthus much, I think that I may let the matter of religion and\nneuroticism drop.",
        "The mass of collateral phenomena, morbid or healthy, with which\nthe various religious phenomena must be compared in order to\nunderstand them better, forms what in the slang of pedagogics is\ntermed “the apperceiving mass” by which we comprehend them.  The\nonly novelty that I can imagine this course of lectures to\npossess lies in the breadth of the apperceiving mass.  I may\nsucceed in discussing religious experiences in a wider context\nthan has been usual in university courses.",
        "Most books on the philosophy of religion try to begin with a\nprecise definition of what its essence consists of.  Some of\nthese would-be definitions may possibly come before us in later\nportions of this course, and I shall not be pedantic enough to\nenumerate any of them to you now. Meanwhile the very fact that\nthey are so many and so different from one another is enough to\nprove that the word “religion” cannot stand for any single\nprinciple or essence, but is rather a collective name.  The\ntheorizing mind tends always to the oversimplification of its\nmaterials.  This is the root of all that absolutism and one-sided\ndogmatism by which both philosophy and religion have been\ninfested.  Let us not fall immediately into a one-sided view of\nour subject, but let us rather admit freely at the outset that we\nmay very likely find no one essence, but many characters which\nmay alternately be equally important to religion.  If we should\ninquire for the essence of “government,” for example, one man\nmight tell us it was authority, another submission, an other\npolice, another an army, another an assembly, an other a system\nof laws; yet all the while it would be true that no concrete\ngovernment can exist without all these things, one of which is\nmore important at one moment and others at another.  The man who\nknows governments most completely is he who troubles himself\nleast about a definition which shall give their essence. \nEnjoying an intimate acquaintance with all their particularities\nin turn, he would naturally regard an abstract conception in\nwhich these were unified as a thing more misleading than\nenlightening.  And why may not religion be a conception equally\ncomplex?[9]",
        "[9]  I can do no better here than refer my readers to the\nextended and admirable remarks on the futility of all these\ndefinitions of religion, in an article by Professor Leuba,\npublished in the Monist for January, 1901, after my own text was\nwritten.",
        "Consider also the “religious sentiment” which we see referred to\nin so many books, as if it were a single sort of mental entity. \nIn the psychologies and in the philosophies of religion, we find\nthe authors attempting to specify just what entity it is.  One\nman allies it to the feeling of dependence; one makes it a\nderivative from fear; others connect it with the sexual life;\nothers still identify it with the feeling of the infinite; and so\non.  Such different ways of conceiving it ought of themselves to\narouse doubt as to whether it possibly can be one specific thing;\nand the moment we are willing to treat the term “religious\nsentiment” as a collective name for the many sentiments which\nreligious objects may arouse in alternation, we see that it\nprobably contains nothing whatever of a psychologically specific\nnature. There is religious fear, religious love, religious awe,\nreligious joy, and so forth.  But religious love is only man’s\nnatural emotion of love directed to a religious object; religious\nfear is only the ordinary fear of commerce, so to speak, the\ncommon quaking of the human breast, in so far as the notion of\ndivine retribution may arouse it; religious awe is the same\norganic thrill which we feel in a forest at twilight, or in a\nmountain gorge; only this time it comes over us at the thought of\nour supernatural relations; and similarly of all the various\nsentiments which may be called into play in the lives of\nreligious persons.  As concrete states of mind, made up of a\nfeeling PLUS a specific sort of object, religious emotions of\ncourse are psychic entities distinguishable from other concrete\nemotions; but there is no ground for assuming a simple abstract\n\"religious emotion” to exist as a distinct elementary mental\naffection by itself, present in every religious experience\nwithout exception.",
        "As there thus seems to be no one elementary religious emotion,\nbut only a common storehouse of emotions upon which religious\nobjects may draw, so there might conceivably also prove to he no\none specific and essential kind of religious object, and no one\nspecific and essential kind of religious act.",
        "The field of religion being as wide as this, it is manifestly\nimpossible that I should pretend to cover it.  My lectures must\nbe limited to a fraction of the subject.  And, although it would\nindeed be foolish to set up an abstract definition of religion’s\nessence, and then proceed to defend that definition against all\ncomers, yet this need not prevent me from taking my own narrow\nview of what religion shall consist in FOR THE PURPOSE OF THESE\nLECTURES, or, out of the many meanings of the word, from choosing\nthe one meaning in which I wish to interest you particularly, and\nproclaiming arbitrarily that when I say “religion” I mean THAT. \nThis, in fact, is what I must do, and I will now preliminarily\nseek to mark out the field I choose.",
        "One way to mark it out easily is to say what aspects of the\nsubject we leave out.  At the outset we are struck by one great\npartition which divides the religious field.  On the one side of\nit lies institutional, on the other personal religion. As M. P.\nSabatier says, one branch of religion keeps the divinity, another\nkeeps man most in view.  Worship and sacrifice, procedures for\nworking on the dispositions of the deity, theology and ceremony\nand ecclesiastical organization, are the essentials of religion\nin the institutional branch. Were we to limit our view to it, we\nshould have to define religion as an external art, the art of\nwinning the favor of the gods.  In the more personal branch of\nreligion it is on the contrary the inner dispositions of man\nhimself which form the center of interest, his conscience, his\ndeserts, his helplessness, his incompleteness.  And although the\nfavor of the God, as forfeited or gained, is still an essential\nfeature of the story, and theology plays a vital part therein,\nyet the acts to which this sort of religion prompts are personal\nnot ritual acts, the individual transacts the business by himself\nalone, and the ecclesiastical organization, with its priests and\nsacraments and other go-betweens, sinks to an altogether\nsecondary place.  The relation goes direct from heart to heart,\nfrom soul to soul, between man and his maker.",
        "Now in these lectures I propose to ignore the institutional\nbranch entirely, to say nothing of the ecclesiastical\norganization, to consider as little as possible the systematic\ntheology and the ideas about the gods themselves, and to confine\nmyself as far as I can to personal religion pure and simple.  To\nsome of you personal religion, thus nakedly considered, will no\ndoubt seem too incomplete a thing to wear the general name.  “It\nis a part of religion,” you will say, “but only its unorganized\nrudiment; if we are to name it by itself, we had better call it\nman’s conscience or morality than his religion.  The name\n’religion’ should be reserved for the fully organized system of\nfeeling, thought, and institution, for the Church, in short, of\nwhich this personal religion, so called, is but a fractional\nelement.”",
        "But if you say this, it will only show the more plainly how much\nthe question of definition tends to become a dispute about names.",
        "Rather than prolong such a dispute, I am willing to accept almost\nany name for the personal religion of which I propose to treat. \nCall it conscience or morality, if you yourselves prefer, and not\nreligion–under either name it will be equally worthy of our\nstudy.  As for myself, I think it will prove to contain some\nelements which morality pure and simple does not contain, and\nthese elements I shall soon seek to point out; so I will myself\ncontinue to apply the word “religion” to it; and in the last\nlecture of all, I will bring in the theologies and the\necclesiasticisms, and say something of its relation to them.",
        "In one sense at least the personal religion will prove itself\nmore fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism.\nChurches, when once established, live at second-hand upon\ntradition; but the FOUNDERS of every church owed their power\noriginally to the fact of their direct personal communion with\nthe divine.  Not only the superhuman founders, the Christ, the\nBuddha, Mahomet, but all the originators of Christian sects have\nbeen in this case;–so personal religion should still seem the\nprimordial thing, even to those who continue to esteem it\nincomplete.",
        "There are, it is true, other things in religion chronologically\nmore primordial than personal devoutness in the moral sense. \nFetishism and magic seem to have preceded inward piety\nhistorically–at least our records of inward piety do not reach\nback so far.  And if fetishism and magic be regarded as stages of\nreligion, one may say that personal religion in the inward sense\nand the genuinely spiritual ecclesiasticisms which it founds are\nphenomena of secondary or even tertiary order.  But, quite apart\nfrom the fact that many anthropologists–for instance, Jevons and\nFrazer –expressly oppose “religion” and “magic” to each other,\nit is certain that the whole system of thought which leads to\nmagic, fetishism, and the lower superstitions may just as well be\ncalled primitive science as called primitive religion. The\nquestion thus becomes a verbal one again; and our knowledge of\nall these early stages of thought and feeling is in any case so\nconjectural and imperfect that farther discussion would not be\nworth while.",
        "Religion, therefore, as I now ask you arbitrarily to take it,\nshall mean for us THE FEELINGS, ACTS, AND EXPERIENCES OF\nINDIVIDUAL MEN IN THEIR SOLITUDE, SO FAR AS THEY APPREHEND\nTHEMSELVES TO STAND IN RELATION TO WHATEVER THEY MAY CONSIDER THE\nDIVINE.  Since the relation may be either moral, physical, or\nritual, it is evident that out of religion in the sense in which\nwe take it, theologies, philosophies, and ecclesiastical\norganizations may secondarily grow.  In these lectures, however,\nas I have already said, the immediate personal experiences will\namply fill our time, and we shall hardly consider theology or\necclesiasticism at all.",
        "We escape much controversial matter by this arbitrary definition\nof our field.  But, still, a chance of controversy comes up over\nthe word “divine,” if we take the definition in too narrow a\nsense.  There are systems of thought which the world usually\ncalls religious, and yet which do not positively assume a God. \nBuddhism is in this case.  Popularly, of course, the Buddha\nhimself stands in place of a God; but in strictness the\nBuddhistic system is atheistic.  Modern transcendental idealism,\nEmersonianism, for instance, also seems to let God evaporate into\nabstract Ideality.  Not a deity in concreto, not a superhuman\nperson, but the immanent divinity in things, the essentially\nspiritual structure of the universe, is the object of the\ntranscendentalist cult.  In that address to the graduating class\nat Divinity College in 1838 which made Emerson famous, the frank\nexpression of this worship of mere abstract laws was what made\nthe scandal of the performance.",
        "“These laws,” said the speaker, “execute themselves.  They are\nout of time, out of space, and not subject to circumstance: \nThus, in the soul of man there is a justice whose retributions\nare instant and entire.  He who does a good deed is instantly\nennobled.  He who does a mean deed is by the action itself\ncontracted.  He who puts off impurity thereby puts on purity.  If\na man is at heart just, then in so far is he God; the safety of\nGod, the immortality of God, the majesty of God, do enter into\nthat man with justice.  If a man dissemble, deceive, he deceives\nhimself, and goes out of acquaintance with his own being. \nCharacter is always known.  Thefts never enrich; alms never\nimpoverish; murder will speak out of stone walls.  The least\nadmixture of a lie–for example, the taint of vanity, any attempt\nto make a good impression, a favorable appearance–will instantly\nvitiate the effect.  But speak the truth, and all things alive or\nbrute are vouchers, and the very roots of the grass underground\nthere do seem to stir and move to bear your witness.  For all\nthings proceed out of the same spirit, which is differently named\nlove, justice, temperance, in its different applications, just as\nthe ocean receives different names on the several shores which it\nwashes.  In so far as he roves from these ends, a man bereaves\nhimself of power, of auxiliaries.  His being shrinks .  . . he\nbecomes less and less, a mote, a point, until absolute badness is\nabsolute death.  The perception of this law awakens in the mind a\nsentiment which we call the religious sentiment, and which makes\nour highest happiness.  Wonderful is its power to charm and to\ncommand.  It is a mountain air.  It is the embalmer of the world.",
        "It makes the sky and the hills sublime, and the silent song of\nthe stars is it.  It is the beatitude of man.  It makes him\nillimitable.  When he says ’I ought’; when love warns him; when\nhe chooses, warned from on high, the good and great deed; then,\ndeep melodies wander through his soul from supreme wisdom.  Then\nhe can worship, and be enlarged by his worship; for he can never\ngo behind this sentiment.  All the expressions of this sentiment\nare sacred and permanent in proportion to their purity.  [They]\naffect us more than all other compositions. The sentences of the\nolden time, which ejaculate this piety, are still fresh and\nfragrant.  And the unique impression of Jesus upon mankind, whose\nname is not so much written as ploughed into the history of this\nworld, is proof of the subtle virtue of this infusion.\"[10]",

        "Such is the Emersonian religion.  The universe has a divine soul\nof order, which soul is moral, being also the soul within the\nsoul of man.  But whether this soul of the universe be a mere\nquality like the eye’s brilliancy or the skin’s softness, or\nwhether it be a self-conscious life like the eye’s seeing or the\nskin’s feeling, is a decision that never unmistakably appears in\nEmerson’s pages.  It quivers on the boundary of these things,\nsometimes leaning one way sometimes the other, to suit the\nliterary rather than the philosophic need.  Whatever it is,\nthough, it is active.  As much as if it were a God, we can trust\nit to protect all ideal interests and keep the world’s balance\nstraight.  The sentences in which Emerson, to the very end, gave\nutterance to this faith are as fine as anything in literature: \n\"If you love and serve men, you cannot by any hiding or stratagem\nescape the remuneration.  Secret retributions are always\nrestoring the level, when disturbed, of the divine justice.  It\nis impossible to tilt the beam.  All the tyrants and proprietors\nand monopolists of the world in vain set their shoulders to heave\nthe bar.  Settles forevermore the ponderous equator to its line,\nand man and mote, and star and sun, must range to it, or be\npulverized by the recoil.\"[11]",
        "[11] Lectures and Biographical Sketches, 1868, p. 186.",
        "Now it would be too absurd to say that the inner experiences that\nunderlie such expressions of faith as this and impel the writer\nto their utterance are quite unworthy to be called religious\nexperiences.  The sort of appeal that Emersonian optimism, on the\none hand, and Buddhistic pessimism, on the other, make to the\nindividual and the son of response which he makes to them in his\nlife are in fact indistinguishable from, and in many respects\nidentical with, the best Christian appeal and response.  We must\ntherefore, from the experiential point of view, call these\ngodless or quasi-godless creeds “religions\"; and accordingly when\nin our definition of religion we speak of the individual’s\nrelation to “what he considers the divine,” we must interpret the\nterm “divine” very broadly, as denoting any object that is god-\nLIKE, whether it be a concrete deity or not.  But the term\n\"godlike,” if thus treated as a floating general quality, becomes\nexceedingly vague, for many gods have flourished in religious\nhistory, and their attributes have been discrepant enough.  What\nthen is that essentially godlike quality–be it embodied in a\nconcrete deity or not–our relation to which determines our\ncharacter as religious men?  It will repay us to seek some answer\nto this question before we proceed farther.",
        "For one thing, gods are conceived to be first things in the way\nof being and power.  They overarch and envelop, and from them\nthere is no escape.  What relates to them is the first and last\nword in the way of truth.  Whatever then were most primal and\nenveloping and deeply true might at this rate be treated as\ngodlike, and a man’s religion might thus be identified with his\nattitude, whatever it might be, toward what he felt to be the\nprimal truth.",
        "Such a definition as this would in a way be defensible. Religion,\nwhatever it is, is a man’s total reaction upon life, so why not\nsay that any total reaction upon life is a religion? Total\nreactions are different from casual reactions, and total\nattitudes are different from usual or professional attitudes.  To\nget at them you must go behind the foreground of existence and\nreach down to that curious sense of the whole residual cosmos as\nan everlasting presence, intimate or alien, terrible or amusing,\nlovable or odious, which in some degree everyone possesses.  This\nsense of the world’s presence, appealing as it does to our\npeculiar individual temperament, makes us either strenuous or\ncareless, devout or blasphemous, gloomy or exultant, about life\nat large; and our reaction, involuntary and inarticulate and\noften half unconscious as it is, is the completest of all our\nanswers to the question, “What is the character of this universe\nin which we dwell?”  It expresses our individual sense of it in\nthe most definite way.  Why then not call these reactions our\nreligion, no matter what specific character they may have? \nNon-religious as some of these reactions may be, in one sense of\nthe word “religious,” they yet belong to THE GENERAL SPHERE OF\nTHE RELIGIOUS LIFE, and so should generically be classed as\nreligious reactions.  “He believes in No-God, and he worships\nhim,” said a colleague of mine of a student who was manifesting a\nfine atheistic ardor; and the more fervent opponents of Christian\ndoctrine have often enough shown a temper which, psychologically\nconsidered, is indistinguishable from religious zeal.",
        "But so very broad a use of the word “religion” would be\ninconvenient, however defensible it might remain on logical\ngrounds.  There are trifling, sneering attitudes even toward the\nwhole of life; and in some men these attitudes are final and\nsystematic.  It would strain the ordinary use of language too\nmuch to call such attitudes religious, even though, from the\npoint of view of an unbiased critical philosophy, they might\nconceivably be perfectly reasonable ways of looking upon life. \nVoltaire, for example, writes thus to a friend, at the age of\nseventy-three:  “As for myself,” he says, “weak as I am, I carry\non the war to the last moment, I get a hundred pike-thrusts, I\nreturn two hundred, and I laugh.  I see near my door Geneva on\nfire with quarrels over nothing, and I laugh again; and, thank\nGod, I can look upon the world as a farce even when it becomes as\ntragic as it sometimes does. All comes out even at the end of the\nday, and all comes out still more even when all the days are\nover.”",
        "Much as we may admire such a robust old gamecock spirit in a\nvaletudinarian, to call it a religious spirit would be odd.  Yet\nit is for the moment Voltaire’s reaction on the whole of life. \nJe me’n fiche is the vulgar French equivalent for our English\nejaculation “Who cares?”   And the happy term je me’n fichisme\nrecently has been invented to designate the systematic\ndetermination not to take anything in <37> life too solemnly. \n\"All is vanity” is the relieving word in all difficult crises for\nthis mode of thought, which that exquisite literary genius Renan\ntook pleasure, in his later days of sweet decay, in putting into\ncoquettishly sacrilegious forms which remain to us as excellent\nexpressions of the “all is vanity” state of mind.  Take the\nfollowing passage, for example–we must hold to duty, even\nagainst the evidence, Renan says–but he then goes on:–",
        "“There are many chances that the world may be nothing but a fairy\npantomime of which no God has care.  We must therefore arrange\nourselves so that on neither hypothesis we shall be completely\nwrong.  We must listen to the superior voices, but in such a way\nthat if the second hypothesis were true we should not have been\ntoo completely duped.  If in effect the world be not a serious\nthing, it is the dogmatic people who will be the shallow ones,\nand the worldly minded whom the theologians now call frivolous\nwill be those who are really wise.",
        "“In utrumque paratus, then.  Be ready for anything–that perhaps\nis wisdom.  Give ourselves up, according to the hour, to\nconfidence, to skepticism, to optimism, to irony and we may be\nsure that at certain moments at least we shall be with the truth.\n. . .  Good-humor is a philosophic state of mind; it seems to say\nto Nature that we take her no more seriously than she takes us. \nI maintain that one should always talk of philosophy with a\nsmile.  We owe it to the Eternal to be virtuous but we have the\nright to add to this tribute our irony as a sort of personal\nreprisal.  In this way we return to the right quarter jest for\njest; we play the trick that has been played on us. Saint\nAugustine’s phrase:  Lord, if we arc deceived, it is by thee!\nremains a fine one, well suited to our modern feeling.  Only we\nwish the Eternal to know that if we accept the fraud, we accept\nit knowingly and willingly.  We are resigned in advance to losing\nthe interest on our investments of virtue, but we wish not to\nappear ridiculous by having counted on them too securely.\"[12]",
        "[12] Feuilles detachees, pp. 394-398 (abridged).",
        "Surely all the usual associations of the word “religion” would\nhave to be stripped away if such a systematic parti pris of irony\nwere also to be denoted by the name.  For common men “religion,\"\nwhatever more special meanings it may have, signifies always a\nSERIOUS state of mind.  If any one phrase could gather its\nuniversal message, that phrase would be, “All is not vanity in\nthis Universe, whatever the appearances may suggest.”  If it can\nstop anything, religion as commonly apprehended can stop just\nsuch chaffing talk as Renan’s.  It favors gravity, not pertness;\nit says “hush” to all vain chatter and smart wit.",
        "But if hostile to light irony, religion is equally hostile to\nheavy grumbling and complaint.  The world appears tragic enough\nin some religions, but the tragedy is realized as purging, and a\nway of deliverance is held to exist. We shall see enough of the\nreligious melancholy in a future lecture; but melancholy,\naccording to our ordinary use of language, forfeits all title to\nbe called religious when, in Marcus Aurelius’s racy words, the\nsufferer simply lies kicking and screaming after the fashion of a\nsacrificed pig.  The mood of a Schopenhauer or a Nietzsche–and\nin a less degree one may sometimes say the same of our own sad\nCarlyle–though often an ennobling sadness, is almost as often\nonly peevishness running away with the bit between its teeth. \nThe sallies of the two German authors remind one, half the time,\nof the sick shriekings of two dying rats.  They lack the\npurgatorial note which religious sadness gives forth.",
        "There must be something solemn, serious, and tender about any\nattitude which we denominate religious.  If glad, it must not\ngrin or snicker; if sad, it must not scream or curse.  It is\nprecisely as being SOLEMN experiences that I wish to interest you\nin religious experiences.  So I propose–arbitrarily again, if\nyou please–to narrow our definition once more by saying that the\nword “divine,” as employed therein, shall mean for us not merely\nthe primal and enveloping and real, for that meaning if taken\nwithout restriction might prove too broad.  The divine shall mean\nfor us only such a primal reality as the individual feels\nimpelled to respond to solemnly and gravely, and neither by a\ncurse nor a jest.",
        "But solemnity, and gravity, and all such emotional attributes,\nadmit of various shades; and, do what we will with our defining,\nthe truth must at last be confronted that we are dealing with a\nfield of experience where there is not a single conception that\ncan be sharply drawn.  The pretension, under such conditions, to\nbe rigorously “scientific” or “exact” in our terms would only\nstamp us as lacking in understanding of our task.  Things are\nmore or less divine, states of mind are more or less religious,\nreactions are more or less total, but the boundaries are always\nmisty, and it is everywhere a question of amount and degree. \nNevertheless, at their extreme of development, there can never be\nany question as to what experiences are religious.  The divinity\nof the object and the solemnity of the reaction are too well\nmarked for doubt.  Hesitation as to whether a state of mind is\n\"religious,” or “irreligious,” or “moral,” or “philosophical,” is\nonly likely to arise when the state of mind is weakly\ncharacterized, but in that case it will be hardly worthy of our\nstudy at all.  With states that can only by courtesy be called\nreligious we need have nothing to do, our only profitable\nbusiness being with what nobody can possibly feel tempted to call\nanything else.  I said in my former lecture that we learn most\nabout a thing when we view it under a microscope, as it were, or\nin its most exaggerated form.  This is as true of religious\nphenomena as of any other kind of fact.  The only cases likely to\nbe profitable enough to repay our attention will therefore be\ncases where the religious spirit is unmistakable and extreme. \nIts fainter manifestations we may tranquilly pass by.  Here, for\nexample, is the total reaction upon life of Frederick Locker\nLampson, whose autobiography, entitled  “Confidences,” proves him\nto have been a most amiable man.",
        "“I am so far resigned to my lot that I feel small pain at the\nthought of having to part from what has been called the pleasant\nhabit of existence, the sweet fable of life.  I would not care to\nlive my wasted life over again, and so to prolong my span. \nStrange to say, I have but little wish to be younger.  I submit\nwith a chill at my heart.  I humbly submit because it is the\nDivine Will, and my appointed destiny.  I dread the increase of\ninfirmities that will make me a burden to those around me, those\ndear to me.  No! let me slip away as quietly and comfortably as I\ncan.  Let the end come, if peace come with it.",
        "“I do not know that there is a great deal to be said for this\nworld, or our sojourn here upon it; but it has pleased God so to\nplace us, and it must please me also.  I ask you, what is human\nlife?  Is not it a maimed happiness–care and weariness,\nweariness and care, with the baseless expectation, the strange\ncozenage of a brighter to-morrow?  At best it is but a froward\nchild, that must be played with and humored, to keep it quiet\ntill it falls asleep, and then the care is over.\"[13]",

        "This is a complex, a tender, a submissive, and a graceful state\nof mind.  For myself, I should have no objection to calling it on\nthe whole a religious state of mind, although I dare say that to\nmany of you it may seem too listless and half-hearted to merit so\ngood a name.  But what matters it in the end whether we call such\na state of mind religious or not?  It is too insignificant for\nour instruction in any case; and its very possessor wrote it down\nin terms which he would not have used unless he had been thinking\nof more energetically religious moods in others, with which he\nfound himself unable to compete.  It is with these more energetic\nstates that our sole business lies, and we can perfectly well\nafford to let the minor notes and the uncertain border go.  It\nwas the extremer cases that I had in mind a little while ago\nwhen I said that personal religion, even without theology or\nritual, would prove to embody some elements that morality pure\nand simple does not contain.  You may remember that I promised\nshortly to point out what those elements were.  In a general way\nI can now say what I had in mind.",
        "“I accept the universe” is reported to have been a favorite\nutterance of our New England transcendentalist, Margaret Fuller;\nand when some one repeated this phrase to Thomas Carlyle, his\nsardonic comment is said to have been:  “Gad! she’d better!”  At\nbottom the whole concern of both morality and religion is with\nthe manner of our acceptance of the universe.  Do we accept it\nonly in part and grudgingly, or heartily and altogether?  Shall\nour protests against certain things in it be radical and\nunforgiving, or shall we think that, even with evil, there are\nways of living that must lead to good?  If we accept the whole,\nshall we do so as if stunned into submission–as Carlyle would\nhave us–\"Gad! we’d better!\"–or shall we do so with enthusiastic\nassent?  Morality pure and simple accepts the law of the whole\nwhich it finds reigning, so far as to acknowledge and obey it,\nbut it may obey it with the heaviest and coldest heart, and never\ncease to feel it as a yoke.  But for religion, in its strong and\nfully developed manifestations, the service of the highest never\nis felt as a yoke.  Dull submission is left far behind, and a\nmood of welcome, which may fill any place on the scale between\ncheerful serenity and enthusiastic gladness, has taken its place.",
        "It makes a tremendous emotional and practical difference to one\nwhether one accept the universe in the drab discolored way of\nstoic resignation to necessity, or with the passionate happiness\nof Christian saints.  The difference is as great as that between\npassivity and activity, as that between the defensive and the\naggressive mood.  Gradual as are the steps by which an individual\nmay grow from one state into the other, many as are the\nintermediate stages which different individuals represent, yet\nwhen you place the typical extremes beside each other for\ncomparison, you feel that two discontinuous psychological\nuniverses confront you, and that in passing from one to the other\na “critical point” has been overcome.",
        "If we compare stoic with Christian ejaculations we see much more\nthan a difference of doctrine; rather is it a difference of\nemotional mood that parts them.  When Marcus Aurelius reflects on\nthe eternal reason that has ordered things, there is a frosty\nchill about his words which you rarely find in a Jewish, and\nnever in a Christian piece of religious writing.  The universe is\n\"accepted” by all these writers; but how devoid of passion or\nexultation the spirit of the Roman Emperor is!  Compare his fine\nsentence:  “If gods care not for me or my children, here is a\nreason for it,” with Job’s cry:  “Though he slay me, yet will I\ntrust in him!” and you immediately see the difference I mean. \nThe anima mundi, to whose disposal of his own personal destiny\nthe Stoic consents, is there to be respected and submitted to,\nbut the Christian God is there to be loved; and the difference of\nemotional atmosphere is like that between an arctic climate and\nthe tropics, though the outcome in the way of accepting actual\nconditions uncomplainingly may seem in abstract terms to be much\nthe same.",
        "“It is a man’s duty,” says Marcus Aurelius, “to comfort himself\nand wait for the natural dissolution, and not to be vexed, but to\nfind refreshment solely in these thoughts–first that nothing\nwill happen to me which is not conformable to the nature of the\nuniverse; and secondly that I need do nothing contrary to the God\nand deity within me; for there is no man who can compel me to\ntransgress.  He is an abscess on the universe who withdraws\nand separates himself from the reason of our common nature,\nthrough being displeased with the things which happen.  For the\nsame nature produces these, and has produced thee too.  And so\naccept everything which happens, even if it seem disagreeable,\nbecause it leads to this, the health of the universe and to the\nprosperity and felicity of Zeus.  For he would not have brought\non any man what he has brought if it were not useful for the\nwhole.  The integrity of the whole is mutilated if thou cuttest\noff anything.  And thou dost cut off, as far as it is in thy\npower, when thou art dissatisfied, and in a manner triest to put\nanything out of the way.\"[14]",

        "Compare now this mood with that of the old Christian author of\nthe Theologia Germanica:–",
        "“Where men are enlightened with the true light, they renounce all\ndesire and choice, and commit and commend themselves and all\nthings to the eternal Goodness, so that every enlightened man\ncould say:  ’I would fain be to the Eternal Goodness what his own\nhand is to a man.’  Such men are in a state of freedom, because\nthey have lost the fear of pain or hell, and the hope of reward\nor heaven, and are living in pure submission to the eternal\nGoodness, in the perfect freedom of fervent love.  When a man\ntruly perceiveth and considereth himself, who and what he is, and\nfindeth himself utterly vile and wicked and unworthy, he falleth\ninto such a deep abasement that it seemeth to him reasonable that\nall creatures in heaven and earth should rise up against him. \nAnd therefore he will not and dare not desire any consolation and\nrelease; but he is willing to be unconsoled and unreleased; and\nhe doth not grieve over his sufferings, for they are right in his\neyes, and he hath nothing to say against them.  This is what is\nmeant by true repentance for sin; and he who in this present time\nentereth into this hell, none may console him.  Now God hath not\nforsaken a man in this hell, but He is laying his hand upon him,\nthat the man may not desire nor regard anything but the eternal\nGood only.  And then, when the man neither careth for nor\ndesireth anything but the eternal Good alone, and seeketh not\nhimself nor his own things, but the honour of God only, he is\nmade a partaker of all manner of joy, bliss, peace, rest, and\nconsolation, and so the man is henceforth in the kingdom of\nheaven.  This hell and this heaven are two good safe ways for a\nman, and happy is he who truly findeth them.\"[15]",

        "Occasionally, it is true, the stoic rises to something like a\nChristian warmth of sentiment, as in the often quoted passage of\nMarcus Aurelius:–",

        "It is a good rule in physiology, when we are studying the meaning\nof an organ, to ask after its most peculiar and characteristic\nsort of performance, and to seek its office in that one of its\nfunctions which no other organ can possibly exert.  Surely the\nsame maxim holds good in our present quest.  The essence of\nreligious experiences, the thing by which we finally must judge\nthem, must be that element or quality in them which we can meet\nnowhere else.  And such a quality will be of course most\nprominent and easy to notice in those religious experiences which\nare most one-sided, exaggerated, and intense.",
        "Now when we compare these intenser experiences with the\nexperiences of tamer minds, so cool and reasonable that we are\ntempted to call them philosophical rather than religious, we find\na character that is perfectly distinct.  That character, it seems\nto me, should be regarded as the practically important\ndifferentia of religion for our purpose; and just what it is can\neasily be brought out by comparing the mind of an abstractly\nconceived Christian with that of a moralist similarly conceived.",
        "A life is manly, stoical, moral, or philosophical, we say, in\nproportion as it is less swayed by paltry personal considerations\nand more by objective ends that call for energy, even though that\nenergy bring personal loss and pain.  This is the good side of\nwar, in so far as it calls for “volunteers.”  And for morality\nlife is a war, and the service of the highest is a sort of cosmic\npatriotism which also calls for volunteers.  Even a sick man,\nunable to be militant outwardly, can carry on the moral warfare. \nHe can willfully turn his attention away from his own future,\nwhether in this world or the next.  He can train himself to\nindifference to his present drawbacks and immerse himself in\nwhatever objective interests still remain accessible.  He can\nfollow public news, and sympathize with other people’s affairs. \nHe can cultivate cheerful manners, and be silent about his\nmiseries. He can contemplate whatever ideal aspects of existence\nhis philosophy is able to present to him, and practice whatever\nduties, such as patience, resignation, trust, his ethical system\nrequires.  Such a man lives on his loftiest, largest plane.  He\nis a high-hearted freeman and no pining slave.  And yet he lacks\nsomething which the Christian par excellence, the mystic and\nascetic saint, for example, has in abundant measure, and which\nmakes of him a human being of an altogether different\ndenomination.",
        "The Christian also spurns the pinched and mumping sick-room\nattitude, and the lives of saints are full of a kind of\ncallousness to diseased conditions of body which probably no\nother human records show.  But whereas the merely moralistic\nspurning takes an effort of volition, the Christian spurning is\nthe result of the excitement of a higher kind of emotion, in the\npresence of which no exertion of volition is required.  The\nmoralist must hold his breath and keep his muscles tense; and so\nlong as this athletic attitude is possible all goes\nwell–morality suffices.  But the athletic attitude tends ever to\nbreak down, and it inevitably does break down even in the most\nstalwart when the organism begins to decay, or when morbid fears\ninvade the mind.  To suggest personal will and effort to one all\nsicklied o’er with the sense of irremediable impotence is to\nsuggest the most impossible of things.  What he craves is to be\nconsoled in his very powerlessness, to feel that the spirit of\nthe universe <47> recognizes and secures him, all decaying and\nfailing as he is.  Well, we are all such helpless failures in the\nlast resort.  The sanest and best of us are of one clay with\nlunatics and prison inmates, and death finally runs the robustest\nof us down.  And whenever we feel this, such a sense of the\nvanity and provisionality of our voluntary career comes over us\nthat all our morality appears but as a plaster hiding a sore it\ncan never cure, and all our well-doing as the hollowest\nsubstitute for that well-BEING that our lives ought to be\ngrounded in, but, alas! are not.",
        "And here religion comes to our rescue and takes our fate into her\nhands.  There is a state of mind, known to religious men, but to\nno others, in which the will to assert ourselves and hold our own\nhas been displaced by a willingness to close our mouths and be as\nnothing in the floods and waterspouts of God.  In this state of\nmind, what we most dreaded has become the habitation of our\nsafety, and the hour of our moral death has turned into our\nspiritual birthday.  The time for tension in our soul is over,\nand that of happy relaxation, of calm deep breathing, of an\neternal present, with no discordant future to be anxious about,\nhas arrived.  Fear is not held in abeyance as it is by mere\nmorality, it is positively expunged and washed away.",
        "We shall see abundant examples of this happy state of mind in\nlater lectures of this course.  We shall see how infinitely\npassionate a thing religion at its highest flights can be.  Like\nlove, like wrath, like hope, ambition, jealousy, like every other\ninstinctive eagerness and impulse, it adds to life an enchantment\nwhich is not rationally or logically deducible from anything\nelse.  This enchantment, coming as a gift when it does come–a\ngift of our organism, the physiologists will tell us, a gift of\nGod’s grace, the theologians say –is either there or not there\nfor us, and there are persons who can no more become possessed by\nit than they can fall in love with a given woman by mere word of\ncommand.  Religious feeling is thus an absolute addition to the\nSubject’s range of life.  It gives him a new sphere of power.\nWhen the outward battle is lost, and the outer world disowns him,\nit redeems and vivifies an interior world which otherwise would\nbe an empty waste.",
        "If religion is to mean anything definite for us, it seems to me\nthat we ought to take it as meaning this added dimension of\nemotion, this enthusiastic temper of espousal, in regions where\nmorality strictly so called can at best but bow its head and\nacquiesce.  It ought to mean nothing short of this new reach of\nfreedom for us, with the struggle over, the keynote of the\nuniverse sounding in our ears, and everlasting possession spread\nbefore our eyes.[18]",

        "This sort of happiness in the absolute and everlasting is what we\nfind nowhere but in religion.  It is parted off from all mere\nanimal happiness, all mere enjoyment of the present, by that\nelement of solemnity of which I have already made so much\naccount.  Solemnity is a hard thing to define abstractly, but\ncertain of its marks are patent enough. A solemn state of mind is\nnever crude or simple–it seems to contain a certain measure of\nits own opposite in solution. A solemn joy preserves a sort of\nbitter in its sweetness; a solemn sorrow is one to which we\nintimately consent.  But there are writers who, realizing that\nhappiness of a supreme sort is the prerogative of religion,\nforget this complication, and call all happiness, as such,\nreligious.  Mr. Havelock Ellis, for example, identifies religion\nwith the entire field of the soul’s liberation from oppressive\nmoods.",
        "“The simplest functions of physiological life,” he writes may be\nits ministers.  Every one who is at all acquainted with the\nPersian mystics knows how wine may be regarded as an instrument\nof religion.  Indeed, in all countries and in all ages some form\nof physical enlargement–singing, dancing, drinking, sexual\nexcitement–has been intimately associated with worship. Even the\nmomentary expansion of the soul in laughter is, to however slight\nan extent, a religious exercise. . . . Whenever an impulse from\nthe world strikes against the organism, and the resultant is not\ndiscomfort or pain, not even the muscular contraction of\nstrenuous manhood, but a joyous expansion or aspiration of the\nwhole soul–there is religion. It is the infinite for which we\nhunger, and we ride gladly on every little wave that promises to\nbear us towards it.\"[19]",

        "But such a straight identification of religion with any and every\nform of happiness leaves the essential peculiarity of religious\nhappiness out.  The more commonplace happinesses which we get are\n\"reliefs,” occasioned by our momentary escapes from evils either\nexperienced or threatened. But in its most characteristic\nembodiments, religious happiness is no mere feeling of escape. \nIt cares no longer to escape.  It consents to the evil outwardly\nas a form of sacrifice–inwardly it knows it to be permanently\novercome. If you ask HOW religion thus falls on the thorns and\nfaces death, and in the very act annuls annihilation, I cannot\nexplain the matter, for it is religion’s secret, and to\nunderstand it you must yourself have been a religious man of the\nextremer type.  In our future examples, even of the simplest and\nhealthiest-minded type of religious consciousness, we shall find\nthis complex sacrificial constitution, in which a higher\nhappiness holds a lower unhappiness in check.  In the Louvre\nthere is a picture, by Guido Reni, of St. Michael with his foot\non Satan’s neck.  The richness of the picture is in large part\ndue to the fiend’s figure being there.  The richness of its\nallegorical meaning also is due to his being there–that is, the\nworld is all the richer for having a devil in it, SO LONG AS WE\nKEEP OUR FOOT UPON HIS NECK.  In the religious consciousness,\nthat is just the position in which the fiend, the negative or\ntragic principle, is found; and for that very reason the\nreligious consciousness is so rich from the emotional point of\nview.[20]  We shall see how in certain men and women it takes on\na monstrously ascetic form.  There are saints who have literally\nfed on the negative principle, on humiliation and privation, and\nthe thought of suffering and death–their souls growing in\nhappiness just in proportion as their outward state grew more\nintolerable.  No other emotion than religious emotion can bring a\nman to this peculiar pass.  And it is for that reason that when\nwe ask our question about the value of religion for human life, I\nthink we ought to look for the answer among these violenter\nexamples rather than among those of a more moderate hue.",

And\nif in these cases, repulsive as they are to our ordinary worldly\nway of judging, we find ourselves compelled to acknowledge\nreligion’s value and treat it with respect, it will have proved\nin some way its value for life at large.  By subtracting and\ntoning down extravagances we may thereupon proceed to trace the\nboundaries of its legitimate sway.",
        "To be sure, it makes our task difficult to have to deal so muck\nwith eccentricities and extremes.  “How CAN religion on the whole\nbe the most important of all human functions,” you may ask, “if\nevery several manifestation of it in turn have to be corrected\nand sobered down and pruned away?”  ",
        "Such a thesis seems a paradox impossible to sustain\nreasonably–yet I believe that something like it will have to be\nour final contention.  That personal attitude which the\nindividual finds himself impelled to take up towards what he\napprehends to be the divine–and you will remember that this was\nour definition–will prove to be both a helpless and a\nsacrificial attitude.  That is, we shall have to confess to at\nleast some amount of dependence on sheer mercy, and to practice\nsome amount of renunciation, great or small, to save our souls\nalive.  The constitution of the world we live in requires it:–",
        "          “Entbehren sollst du! sollst entbehren!\n           Das ist der ewige Gesang\n           Der jedem an die Ohren klingt,\n           Den, unser ganzes Leben lang\n           Uns heiser jede Stunde singt.”",
        "For when all is said and done, we are in the end absolutely\ndependent on the universe; and into sacrifices and surrenders of\nsome sort, deliberately looked at and accepted, we are drawn and\npressed as into our only permanent positions of repose.  Now in\nthose states of mind which fall short of religion, the surrender\nis submitted to as an imposition of necessity, and the sacrifice\nis undergone at the very best without complaint.  In the\nreligious life, on the contrary, surrender and sacrifice are\npositively espoused:  even unnecessary givings-up are added in\norder that the happiness may increase.  Religion thus makes easy\nand felicitous what in any case is necessary; and if it be the\nonly agency that can accomplish this result, its vital importance\nas a human faculty stands vindicated beyond dispute.  It becomes\nan essential organ of our life, performing a function which no\nother portion of our nature can so successfully fulfill.  From\nthe merely biological point of view, so to call it, this is a\nconclusion to which, so far as I can now see, we shall inevitably\nbe led, and led moreover by following the purely empirical method\nof demonstration which I sketched to you in the first lecture. \nOf the farther office of religion as a metaphysical revelation I\nwill say nothing now.",
        "But to foreshadow the terminus of one’s investigations is one\nthing, and to arrive there safely is another.  In the next\nlecture, abandoning the extreme generalities which have engrossed\nus hitherto, I propose that we begin our actual journey by\naddressing ourselves directly to the concrete facts.",
        "Were one asked to characterize the life of religion in the\nbroadest and most general terms possible, one might say that it\nconsists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that\nour supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves\nthereto.  This belief and this adjustment are the religious\nattitude in the soul.  I wish during this hour to call your\nattention to some of the psychological peculiarities of such an\nattitude as this, or belief in an object which we cannot see. \nAll our attitudes, moral, practical, or emotional, as well as\nreligious, are due to the “objects” of our consciousness, the\nthings which we believe to exist, whether really or ideally,\nalong with ourselves.  Such objects may be present to our senses,\nor they may be present only to our thought.  In either case they\nelicit from us a REACTION; and the reaction due to things of\nthought is notoriously in many cases as strong as that due to\nsensible presences.  It may be even stronger.  The memory of an\ninsult may make us angrier than the insult did when we received\nit.  We are frequently more ashamed of our blunders afterwards\nthan we were at the moment of making them; and in general our\nwhole higher prudential and moral life is based on the fact that\nmaterial sensations actually present may have a weaker influence\non our action than ideas of remoter facts.",
        "The more concrete objects of most men’s religion, the deities\nwhom they worship, are known to them only in idea.  It has been\nvouchsafed, for example, to very few Christian believers to have\nhad a sensible vision of their Saviour; though enough appearances\nof this sort are on record, by way of miraculous exception, to\nmerit our attention later.  The whole force of the Christian\nreligion, therefore, so far as belief in the divine personages\ndetermines the prevalent attitude of the believer, is in general\nexerted by the instrumentality of pure ideas, of which nothing in\nthe individual’s past experience directly serves as a model.",
        "But in addition to these ideas of the more concrete religious\nobjects, religion is full of abstract objects which prove to have\nan equal power.  God’s attributes as such, his holiness, his\njustice, his mercy, his absoluteness, his infinity, his\nomniscience, his tri-unity, the various mysteries of the\nredemptive process, the operation of the sacraments, etc., have\nproved fertile wells of inspiring meditation for Christian\nbelievers.[21] We shall see later that the absence of definite\nsensible images is positively insisted on by the mystical\nauthorities in all religions as the sine qua non of a successful\norison, or contemplation of the higher divine truths. Such\ncontemplations are expected (and abundantly verify the\nexpectation, as we shall also see) to influence the believer’s\nsubsequent attitude very powerfully for good.",
        "[21] Example:  “I have had much comfort lately in meditating on\nthe passages which show the personality of the Holy Ghost, and\nhis distinctness from the Father and the Son.  It is a subject\nthat requires searching into to find out, but, when realized,\ngives one so much more true and lively a sense of the fullness of\nthe Godhead, and its work in us and to us, than when only\nthinking of the Spirit in its effect on us.”  Augustus Hare: \nMemorials, i. 244, Maria Hare to Lucy H. Hare.",
        "Immanuel Kant held a curious doctrine about such objects of\nbelief as God, the design of creation, the soul, its freedom, and\nthe life hereafter.  These things, he said, are properly not\nobjects of knowledge at all.  Our conceptions always require a\nsense-content to work with, and as the words soul,”  “God,\"\n\"immortality,” cover no distinctive sense-content whatever, it\nfollows that theoretically speaking they are words devoid of any\nsignificance.  Yet strangely enough they have a definite meaning\nFOR OUR PRACTICE.  We can act AS IF there were a God; feel AS IF\nwe were free; consider Nature AS IF she were full of special\ndesigns; lay plans AS IF we were to be immortal; and we find then\nthat these words do make a genuine difference in our moral life. \nOur faith THAT these unintelligible objects actually exist proves\nthus to be a full equivalent in praktischer Hinsicht, as Kant\ncalls it, or from the point of view of our action, for a\nknowledge of WHAT they might be, in case we were permitted\npositively to conceive them.  So we have the strange phenomenon,\nas Kant assures us, of a mind believing with all its strength in\nthe real presence of a set of things of no one of which it can\nform any notion whatsoever.",
        "My object in thus recalling Kant’s doctrine to your mind is not\nto express any opinion as to the accuracy of this particularly\nuncouth part of his philosophy, but only to illustrate the\ncharacteristic of human nature which we are considering, by an\nexample so classical in its exaggeration.  The sentiment of\nreality can indeed attach itself so strongly to our object of\nbelief that our whole life is polarized through and through, so\nto speak, by its sense of the existence of the thing believed in,\nand yet that thing, for purpose of definite description, can\nhardly be said to be present to our mind at all.  It is as if a\nbar of iron, without touch or sight, with no representative\nfaculty whatever, might nevertheless be strongly endowed with an\ninner capacity for magnetic feeling; and as if, through the\nvarious arousals of its magnetism by magnets coming and going in\nits neighborhood, it might be consciously determined to different\nattitudes and tendencies. Such a bar of iron could never give you\nan outward description of the agencies that had the power of\nstirring it so strongly; yet of their presence, and of their\nsignificance for its life, it would be intensely aware through\nevery fibre of its being.",
        "It is not only the Ideas of pure Reason as Kant styled them, that\nhave this power of making us vitally feel presences that we are\nimpotent articulately to describe.  All sorts of higher\nabstractions bring with them the same kind of impalpable appeal. \nRemember those passages from Emerson which I read at my last\nlecture.  The whole universe of concrete objects, as we know\nthem, swims, not only for such a transcendentalist writer, but\nfor all of us, in a wider and higher universe of abstract ideas,\nthat lend it its significance.  As time, space, and the ether\nsoak through all things so (we feel) do abstract and essential\ngoodness, beauty, strength, significance, justice, soak through\nall things good, strong, significant, and just.",
        "Such ideas, and others equally abstract, form the background for\nall our facts, the fountain-head of all the possibilities we\nconceive of.  They give its “nature,” as we call it, to every\nspecial thing.  Everything we know is “what” it is by sharing in\nthe nature of one of these abstractions.  We can never look\ndirectly at them, for they are bodiless and featureless and\nfootless, but we grasp all other things by their means, and in\nhandling the real world we should be stricken with helplessness\nin just so far forth as we might lose these mental objects, these\nadjectives and adverbs and predicates and heads of classification\nand conception.",
        "This absolute determinability of our mind by abstractions is one\nof the cardinal facts in our human constitution. Polarizing and\nmagnetizing us as they do, we turn towards them and from them, we\nseek them, hold them, hate them, bless them, just as if they were\nso many concrete beings. And beings they are, beings as real in\nthe realm which they inhabit as the changing things of sense are\nin the realm of space.",
        "Plato gave so brilliant and impressive a defense of this common\nhuman feeling, that the doctrine of the reality of abstract\nobjects has been known as the platonic theory of ideas ever\nsince.  Abstract Beauty, for example, is for Plato a perfectly\ndefinite individual being, of which the intellect is aware as of\nsomething additional to all the perishing beauties of the earth. \n\"The true order of going,” he says, in the often quoted passage\nin his “Banquet,” “is to use the beauties of earth as steps along\nwhich one mounts upwards for the sake of that other Beauty, going\nfrom one to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair\nforms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions,\nuntil from fair notions, he arrives at the notion of absolute\nBeauty, and at last knows what the essence of Beauty is.\"[22]  In\nour last lecture we had a glimpse of the way in which a\nplatonizing writer like Emerson may treat the abstract divineness\nof things, the moral structure of the universe, as a fact worthy\nof worship.  In those various churches without a God which to-day\nare spreading through the world under the name of ethical\nsocieties, we have a similar worship of the abstract divine, the\nmoral law believed in as an ultimate object.  “Science” in many\nminds is genuinely taking the place of a religion.  Where this is\nso, the scientist treats the “Laws of Nature” as objective facts\nto be revered.  A brilliant school of interpretation of Greek\nmythology would have it that in their origin the Greek gods were\nonly half-metaphoric personifications of those great spheres of\nabstract law and order into which the natural world falls\napart–the sky-sphere, the ocean-sphere, the earth-sphere, and\nthe like; just as even now we may speak of the smile of the\nmorning, the kiss of the breeze, or the bite of the cold, without\nreally meaning that these phenomena of nature actually wear a\nhuman face.[23]",

        "As regards the origin of the Greek gods, we need not at present\nseek an opinion.  But the whole array of our instances leads to a\nconclusion something like this:  It is as if there were in the\nhuman consciousness a sense of reality, a feeling of objective\npresence, a perception of what we may call “something there,\"\nmore deep and more general than any of the special and particular\n\"senses” by which the current psychology supposes existent\nrealities to be originally revealed.  If this were so, we might\nsuppose the senses to waken our attitudes and conduct as they so\nhabitually do, by first exciting this sense of reality; but\nanything else, any idea, for example, that might similarly excite\nit, would have that same prerogative of appearing real which\nobjects of sense normally possess.  So far as religious\nconceptions were able to touch this reality-feeling, they would\nbe believed in in spite of criticism, even though they might be\nso vague and remote as to be almost unimaginable, even though\nthey might be such non-entities in point of WHATNESS, as Kant\nmakes the objects of his moral theology to be.",
        "The most curious proofs of the existence of such an\nundifferentiated sense of reality as this are found in\nexperiences of hallucination.  It often happens that an\nhallucination is imperfectly developed:  the person affected will\nfeel a “presence” in the room, definitely localized, facing in\none particular way, real in the most emphatic sense of the word,\noften coming suddenly, and as suddenly gone; and yet neither\nseen, heard, touched, nor cognized in any of the usual “sensible\"\nways.  Let me give you an example of this, before I pass to the\nobjects with whose presence religion is more peculiarly\nconcerned.",
        "An intimate friend of mine, one of the keenest intellects I know,\nhas had several experiences of this sort.  He writes as follows\nin response to my inquiries:–<59>",
        "“I have several times within the past few years felt the so-\ncalled ’consciousness of a presence.’  The experiences which I\nhave in mind are clearly distinguishable from another kind of\nexperience which I have had very frequently, and which I fancy\nmany persons would also call the ’consciousness of a presence.’\nBut the difference for me between the two sets of experience is\nas great as the difference between feeling a slight warmth\noriginating I know not where, and standing in the midst of a\nconflagration with all the ordinary senses alert.",
        "“It was about September, 1884, when I had the first experience.\nOn the previous night I had had, after getting into bed at my\nrooms in College, a vivid tactile hallucination of being grasped\nby the arm, which made me get up and search the room for an\nintruder; but the sense of presence properly so called came on\nthe next night.  After I had got into bed and blown out the\ncandle, I lay awake awhile thinking on the previous night’s\nexperience, when suddenly I FELT something come into the room and\nstay close to my bed.  It remained only a minute or two.  I did\nnot recognize it by any ordinary sense and yet there was a\nhorribly unpleasant ’sensation’ connected with it.  It stirred\nsomething more at the roots of my being than any ordinary\nperception.  The feeling had something of the quality of a very\nlarge tearing vital pain spreading chiefly over the chest, but\nwithin the organism–and yet the feeling was not PAIN so much as\nABHORRENCE.  At all events, something was present with me, and I\nknew its presence far more surely than I have ever known the\npresence of any fleshly living creature.  I was conscious of its\ndeparture as of its coming:  an almost instantaneously swift\ngoing through the door, and the ’horrible sensation’ disappeared.",
        "“On the third night when I retired my mind was absorbed in some\nlectures which I was preparing, and I was still absorbed in these\nwhen I became aware of the actual presence (though not of the\nCOMING) of the thing that was there the night before, and of the\n’horrible sensation.’ I then mentally concentrated all my effort\nto charge this ’thing,’ if it was evil to depart, if it was NOT\nevil, to tell me who or what it was, and if it could not explain\nitself, to go, and that I would compel it <60> to go.  It went\nas on the previous night, and my body quickly recovered its\nnormal state.",
        "“On two other occasions in my life I have had precisely the same\n’horrible sensation.’  Once it lasted a full quarter of an hour. \nIn all three instances the certainty that there in outward space\nthere stood SOMETHING was indescribably STRONGER than the\nordinary certainty of companionship when we are in the close\npresence of ordinary living people.  The something seemed close\nto me, and intensely more real than any ordinary perception.\nAlthough I felt it to be like unto myself so to speak, or finite,\nsmall, and distressful, as it were, I didn’t recognize it as any\nindividual being or person.”",
        "Of course such an experience as this does not connect itself with\nthe religious sphere.  Yet it may upon occasion do so; and the\nsame correspondent informs me that at more than one other\nconjuncture he had the sense of presence developed with equal\nintensity and abruptness, only then it was filled with a quality\nof joy.",
        "“There was not a mere consciousness of something there, but fused\nin the central happiness of it, a startling awareness of some\nineffable good.  Not vague either, not like the emotional effect\nof some poem, or scene, or blossom, of music, but the sure\nknowledge of the close presence of a sort of mighty person, and\nafter it went, the memory persisted as the one perception of\nreality.  Everything else might be a dream, but not that.”",
        "My friend, as it oddly happens, does not interpret these latter\nexperiences theistically, as signifying the presence of God.  But\nit would clearly not have been unnatural to interpret them as a\nrevelation of the deity’s existence.  When we reach the subject\nof mysticism, we shall have much more to say upon this head.",

I put my book down, and\nalthough my excitement was great, I felt quite collected, and not\nconscious of any sense of fear.  Without changing my position,\nand looking straight at the fire, I knew somehow that my friend\nA. H. was standing at my left elbow but so far behind me as to be\nhidden by the armchair in which I was leaning back.

This may provoke\na smile, but I can only tell you the facts as they occurred to\nme.  I do not know how to better describe my sensations than by\nsimply stating that I felt a consciousness of a spiritual\npresence. . . .

        "“Whenever I practice automatic writing, what makes me feel that\nit is not due to a subconscious self is the feeling I always have\nof a foreign presence, external to my body.  It is sometimes so\ndefinitely characterized that I could point to its exact\nposition.  This impression of presence is impossible to describe.\nIt varies in intensity and clearness according to the personality\nfrom whom the writing professes to come.

The presence was that of\nthe figure of a gray-bearded man dressed in a pepper and salt\nsuit, squeezing himself under the crack of the door and moving\nacross the floor of the room towards a sofa.  The blind subject\nof this quasi-hallucination is an exceptionally intelligent\nreporter.  He is entirely without internal visual imagery and\ncannot represent light or colors to himself, and is positive that\nhis other senses, hearing, etc., were not involved in this false\nperception.

For the\npsychologists the tracing of the organic seat of such a feeling\nwould form a pretty problem–nothing could be more natural than\nto connect it with the muscular sense, with the feeling that our\nmuscles were innervating themselves for action.  Whatsoever thus\ninnervated our activity, or “made our flesh creep\"–our senses\nare what do so oftenest–might then appear real and present, even\nthough it were but an abstract idea.

I know now that it was a personal\nrelation I was in to it, because of late years the power of\ncommunicating with it has left me, and I am conscious of a\nperfectly definite loss.  I used never to fail to find it when I\nturned to it.  Then came a set of years when sometimes I found\nit, and then again I would be wholly unable to make connection\nwith it.  I remember many occasions on which at night in bed, I\nwould be unable to get to sleep on account of worry.  I turned\nthis way and that in the darkness, and groped mentally for the\nfamiliar sense of that higher mind of my mind which had always\nseemed to be close at hand as it were, closing the passage, and\nyielding support, but there was no electric current.  A blank was\nthere instead of IT:  I couldn’t find anything.  Now, at the age\nof nearly fifty, my power of getting into connection with it has\nentirely left me; and I have to confess that a great help has\ngone out of my life.  Life has become curiously dead and <65>\nindifferent; and I can now see that my old experience was\nprobably exactly the same thing as the prayers of the orthodox,\nonly I did not call them by that name.  What I have spoken of as\n’It’ was practically not Spencer’s Unknowable, but just my own\ninstinctive and individual God, whom I relied upon for higher\nsympathy, but whom somehow I have lost.”",
        "Nothing is more common in the pages of religious biography than\nthe way in which seasons of lively and of difficult faith are\ndescribed as alternating.  Probably every religious person has\nthe recollection of particular crisis in which a directer vision\nof the truth, a direct perception, perhaps, of a living God’s\nexistence, swept in and overwhelmed the languor of the more\nordinary belief.  In James Russell Lowell’s correspondence there\nis a brief memorandum of an experience of this kind:–",
        "“I had a revelation last Friday evening.  I was at Mary’s, and\nhappening to say something of the presence of spirits (of whom, I\nsaid, I was often dimly aware), Mr. Putnam entered into an\nargument with me on spiritual matters.  As I was speaking, the\nwhole system rose up before me like a vague destiny looming from\nthe Abyss.  I never before so clearly felt the Spirit of God in\nme and around rue.  The whole room seemed to me full of God.  The\nair seemed to waver to and fro with the presence of Something I\nknew not what.  I spoke with the calmness and clearness of a\nprophet.  I cannot tell you what this revelation was.  I have not\nyet studied it enough.  But I shall perfect it one day, and then\nyou shall hear it and acknowledge its grandeur.\"[27]",

        "<66> Here is a longer and more developed experience from a\nmanuscript communication by a clergyman–I take it from\nStarbuck’s manuscript collection:–",
        "“I remember the night, and almost the very spot on the hill-top,\nwhere my soul opened out, as it were, into the Infinite, and\nthere was a rushing together of the two worlds, the inner and the\nouter.  It was deep calling unto deep–the deep that my own\nstruggle had opened up within being answered by the unfathomable\ndeep without, reaching beyond the stars.  I stood alone with Him\nwho had made me, and all the beauty of the world, and love, and\nsorrow, and even temptation.  I did not seek Him, but felt the\nperfect unison of my spirit with His.  The ordinary sense of\nthings around me faded.  For the moment nothing but an ineffable\njoy and exultation remained.  It is impossible fully to describe\nthe experience.  It was like the effect of some great orchestra\nwhen all the separate notes have melted into one swelling harmony\nthat leaves the listener conscious of nothing save that his soul\nis being wafted upwards, and almost bursting with its own\nemotion.  The perfect stillness of the night was thrilled by a\nmore solemn silence.  The darkness held a presence that was all\nthe more felt because it was not seen.  I could not any more have\ndoubted that HE was there than that I was.  Indeed, I felt myself\nto be, if possible, the less real of the two.",
        "“My highest faith in God and truest idea of him were then born in\nme.  I have stood upon the Mount of Vision since, and felt the\nEternal round about me.  But never since has there come quite the\nsame stirring of the heart.  Then, if ever, I believe, I stood\nface to face with God, and was born anew of his spirit. There\nwas, as I recall it, no sudden change of thought or of belief,\nexcept that my early crude conception, had, as it were burst into\nflower.  There was no destruction of the old, but a rapid,\nwonderful unfolding.  Since that time no discussion that I have\nheard of the proofs of God’s existence has been able to shake my\nfaith.  Having once felt the presence of God’s spirit, I have\nnever lost it again for long.  My most assuring evidence of his\nexistence is deeply rooted in that hour of vision in the memory\nof that supreme experience, and in the conviction, gained from\nreading and reflection, that something the same has come to all\nwho have found God.  I am aware that it may justly be called\nmystical.  I am not enough acquainted with philosophy to defend\nit from that or any other charge.  I feel that in writing of it I\nhave overlaid it with words rather than put it clearly to your\nthought.  But, such as it is, I have described it as carefully as\nI now am able to do.”",
        "Here is another document, even more definite in character, which,\nthe writer being a Swiss, I translate from the French\noriginal.[28]",
        "[28] I borrow it, with Professor Flournoy’s permission, from his\nrich collection of psychological documents.",
        "“I was in perfect health:  we were on our sixth day of tramping,\nand in good training.  We had come the day before from Sixt to\nTrient by Buet.  I felt neither fatigue, hunger, nor thirst, and\nmy state of mind was equally healthy.  I had had at Forlaz good\nnews from home; I was subject to no anxiety, either near or\nremote, for we had a good guide, and there was not a shadow of\nuncertainty about the road we should follow.  I can best describe\nthe condition in which I was by calling it a state of\nequilibrium.  When all at once I experienced a feeling of being\nraised above myself, I felt the presence of God–I tell of the\nthing just as I was conscious of it–as if his goodness and his\npower were penetrating me altogether.  The throb of emotion was\nso violent that I could barely tell the boys to pass on and not\nwait for me.  I then sat down on a stone, unable to stand any\nlonger, and my eyes overflowed with tears.  I thanked God that in\nthe course of my life he had taught me to know him, that he\nsustained my life and took pity both on the insignificant\ncreature and on the sinner that I was.  I begged him ardently\nthat my life might be consecrated to the doing of his will.  I\nfelt his reply, which was that I should do his will from day to\nday in humility and poverty, leaving him, the Almighty God, to be\njudge of whether I should some time be called to bear witness\nmore conspicuously.  Then, slowly, the ecstasy left my heart;\nthat is, I felt that God had withdrawn the communion which he had\ngranted, and I was able to walk on, but very slowly, so strongly\nwas I still possessed by the interior emotion. Besides, I had\nwept uninterruptedly for several minutes, my eyes were swollen,\nand I did not wish my companions to see me.  The state of ecstasy\nmay have lasted four or five minutes, although it seemed at the\ntime to last much longer.  My comrades waited for me ten minutes\nat the cross of Barine, but I took about twenty-five or thirty\nminutes to join them, for as well as I can remember, they said\nthat I had kept them back for about half an hour.  The impression\nhad been so profound that in climbing slowly the slope I asked\nmyself if it were possible that Moses on Sinai could have had a\nmore intimate communication with God.  I think it well to add\nthat in this ecstasy of mine God had neither form, color, odor,\nnor taste; moreover, that the feeling of his presence was\naccompanied with no determinate localization. It was rather as if\nmy personality had been transformed by the presence of a\nSPIRITUAL SPIRIT.  But the more I seek words to express this\nintimate intercourse, the more I feel the impossibility of\ndescribing the thing by any of our usual images.  At bottom the\nexpression most apt to render what I felt is this:  God was\npresent, though invisible; he fell under no one of my senses, yet\nmy consciousness perceived him.”",
        "The adjective “mystical” is technically applied, most often. to\nstates that are of brief duration.  Of course such hours of\nrapture as the last two persons describe are mystical\nexperiences, of which in a later lecture I shall have much to\nsay.  Meanwhile here is the abridged record of another mystical\nor semi-mystical experience, in a mind evidently framed by nature\nfor ardent piety.  I owe it to Starbuck’s collection.  The lady\nwho gives the account is the daughter of a man well known in his\ntime as a writer against Christianity.  The suddenness of her\nconversion shows well how native the sense of God’s presence must\nbe to certain minds.  She relates that she was brought up in\nentire ignorance of Christian doctrine, but, when in Germany,\nafter being talked to by Christian friends, she read the Bible\nand prayed, and finally the plan of salvation flashed upon her\nlike a stream of light.",
        "<69> “To this day,” she writes, “I cannot understand dallying\nwith religion and the commands of God.  The very instant I heard\nmy Father’s cry calling unto me, my heart bounded in recognition.",
        "I ran, I stretched forth my arms, I cried aloud, ’Here, here I\nam, my Father.’ Oh, happy child, what should I do?  ’Love me,’\nanswered my God.  ’I do, I do,’ I cried passionately. ’Come unto\nme,’ called my Father.  ’I will,’ my heart panted.  Did I stop to\nask a single question?  Not one.  It never occurred to me to ask\nwhether I was good enough, or to hesitate over my unfitness, or\nto find out what I thought of his church, or . . . to wait until\nI should be satisfied.  Satisfied! I was satisfied.  Had I not\nfound my God and my Father?  Did he not love me?  Had he not\ncalled me?  Was there not a Church into which I might enter?  . .\n. Since then I have had direct answers to prayer–so significant\nas to be almost like talking with God and hearing his answer. \nThe idea of God’s reality has never left me for one moment.”",
        "Here is still another case, the writer being a man aged\ntwenty-seven, in which the experience, probably almost as\ncharacteristic, is less vividly described:–",
        "“I have on a number of occasions felt that I had enjoyed a period\nof intimate communion with the divine.  These meetings came\nunasked and unexpected, and seemed to consist merely in the\ntemporary obliteration of the conventionalities which usually\nsurround and cover my life. . . .  Once it was when from the\nsummit of a high mountain I looked over a gashed and corrugated\nlandscape extending to a long convex of ocean that ascended to\nthe horizon, and again from the same point when I could see\nnothing beneath me but a boundless expanse of white cloud, on the\nblown surface of which a few high peaks, including the one I was\non, seemed plunging about as if they were dragging their anchors.",
        "What I felt on these occasions was a temporary loss of my own\nidentity, accompanied by an illumination which revealed to me a\ndeeper significance than I had been wont to attach to life.  It\nis in this that I find my justification for saying that I have\nenjoyed communication with God.  Of course the absence of such a\nbeing as this would be chaos. I cannot conceive of life without\nits presence.”",
        "Of the more habitual and so to speak chronic sense of God’s\npresence the following sample from Professor Starbuck’s\nmanuscript collection may serve to give an idea.  It is from a\nman aged forty-nine–probably thousands of unpretending\nChristians would write an almost identical account.",
        "“God is more real to me than any thought or thing or person.  I\nfeel his presence positively, and the more as I live in closer\nharmony with his laws as written in my body and mind.  I feel him\nin the sunshine or rain; and awe mingled with a delicious\nrestfulness most nearly describes my feelings.  I talk to him as\nto a companion in prayer and praise, and our communion is\ndelightful.  He answers me again and again, often in words so\nclearly spoken that it seems my outer ear must have carried the\ntone, but generally in strong mental impressions.  Usually a text\nof Scripture, unfolding some new view of him and his love for me,\nand care for my safety.  I could give hundreds of instances, in\nschool matters, social problems, financial difficulties, etc. \nThat he is mine and I am his never leaves me, it is an abiding\njoy.  Without it life would be a blank, a desert, a shoreless,\ntrackless waste.”",
        "I subjoin some more examples from writers of different ages and\nsexes.  They are also from Professor Starbuck’s collection, and\ntheir number might be greatly multiplied.  The first is from a\nman twenty-seven years old:–",
        "“God is quite real to me.  I talk to him and often get answers.\nThoughts sudden and distinct from any I have been entertaining\ncome to my mind after asking God for his direction.  Something\nover a year ago I was for some weeks in the direst perplexity.\nWhen the trouble first appeared before me I was dazed, but before\nlong (two or three hours) I could hear distinctly a passage of\nScripture:  ’My grace is sufficient for thee.’  Every time my\nthoughts turned to the trouble I could hear this quotation.  I\ndon’t think I ever doubted the existence of God, or had him drop\nout of my consciousness.  God has frequently stepped into my\naffairs very perceptibly, and I feel that he directs many little\ndetails all the time.  But on two or three occasions he has\nordered ways for me very contrary to my ambitions and plans.”",
        "Another statement (none the less valuable psychologically for\nbeing so decidedly childish) is that of a boy of seventeen:–",
        "“Sometimes as I go to church, I sit down, join in the service,\nand before I go out I feel as if God was with me, right side of\nme, singing and reading the Psalms with me. . . . And then again\nI feel as if I could sit beside him, and put my arms around him,\nkiss him, etc.  When I am taking Holy Communion at the altar, I\ntry to get with him and generally feel his presence.”",
        "I let a few other cases follow at random:–",
        "“God surrounds me like the physical atmosphere.  He is closer to\nme than my own breath.  In him literally I live and move and have\nmy being.\"–",
        "“There are times when I seem to stand in his very presence, to\ntalk with him.  Answers to prayer have come, sometimes direct and\noverwhelming in their revelation of his presence and powers. \nThere are times when God seems far off, but this is always my own\nfault.\"–",
        "“I have the sense of a presence, strong, and at the same time\nsoothing, which hovers over me.  Sometimes it seems to enwrap me\nwith sustaining arms.”",
        "Such is the human ontological imagination, and such is the\nconvincingness of what it brings to birth.  Unpicturable beings\nare realized, and realized with an intensity almost like that of\nan hallucination.  They determine our vital attitude as\ndecisively as the vital attitude of lovers is determined by the\nhabitual sense, by which each is haunted, of the other being in\nthe world.  A lover has notoriously this sense of the continuous\nbeing of his idol, even when his attention is addressed to other\nmatters and he no longer represents her features.  He cannot\nforget her; she uninterruptedly affects him through and through. \nI spoke of the convincingness of these feelings of reality, and I\nmust dwell a moment longer on that point.  They are as convincing\nto those who have them as any direct sensible experiences can be,\nand they are, as a rule, much more convincing than results\nestablished by mere logic ever are.  One may indeed be entirely\nwithout them; probably more than one of you here present is\nwithout them in any marked degree; but if you do have them, and\nhave them at all strongly, the probability is that you cannot\nhelp regarding them as genuine perceptions of truth, as\nrevelations of a kind of reality which no adverse argument,\nhowever unanswerable by you in words, can expel from your belief.",
        "The opinion opposed to mysticism in philosophy is sometimes\nspoken of as RATIONALISM.  Rationalism insists that all our\nbeliefs ought ultimately to find for themselves articulate\ngrounds.  Such grounds, for rationalism, must consist of four\nthings:  (1) definitely statable abstract principles; (2)\ndefinite facts of sensation; (3) definite hypotheses based on\nsuch facts; and (4) definite inferences logically drawn.  Vague\nimpressions of something indefinable have no place in the\nrationalistic system, which on its positive side is surely a\nsplendid intellectual tendency, for not only are all our\nphilosophies fruits of it, but physical science (amongst other\ngood things) is its result.",
        "Nevertheless, if we look on man’s whole mental life as it exists,\non the life of men that lies in them apart from their learning\nand science, and that they inwardly and privately follow, we have\nto confess that the part of it of which rationalism can give an\naccount is relatively superficial.  It is the part that has the\nprestige undoubtedly, for it has the loquacity, it can challenge\nyou for proofs, and chop logic, and put you down with words.  But\nit will fail to convince or convert you all the same, if your\ndumb intuitions are opposed to its conclusions.  If you have\nintuitions at all, they come from a deeper level of your nature\nthan the loquacious level which rationalism inhabits.  Your whole\nsubconscious life, your impulses, your faiths, your needs, your\ndivinations, have prepared the premises, of which your\nconsciousness now feels the weight of the result; and something\nin you absolutely KNOWS that that result must be truer than any\nlogic-chopping rationalistic talk, however clever, that may\ncontradict it.  This inferiority of the rationalistic level in\nfounding belief is just as manifest when rationalism argues for\nreligion as when it argues against it.  That vast literature of\nproofs of God’s existence drawn from the order of nature, which a\ncentury ago seemed so overwhelmingly convincing, to-day does\nlittle more than gather dust in libraries, for the simple reason\nthat our generation has ceased to believe in the kind of God it\nargued for.  Whatever sort of a being God may be, we KNOW to-day\nthat he is nevermore that mere external inventor of\n\"contrivances” intended to make manifest his “glory” in which our\ngreat-grandfathers took such satisfaction, though just how we\nknow this we cannot possibly make clear by words either to others\nor to ourselves.  I defy any of you here fully to account for\nyour persuasion that if a God exist he must be a more cosmic and\ntragic personage than that Being.",
        "The truth is that in the metaphysical and religious sphere,\narticulate reasons are cogent for us only when our inarticulate\nfeelings of reality have already been impressed in favor of the\nsame conclusion.  Then, indeed, our intuitions and our reason\nwork together, and great world-ruling systems, like that of the\nBuddhist or of the Catholic philosophy, may grow up. Our\nimpulsive belief is here always what sets up the original body of\ntruth, and our articulately verbalized philosophy is but its\nshowy translation into formulas.  The unreasoned and immediate\nassurance is the deep thing in us, the reasoned argument is but a\nsurface exhibition.  Instinct leads, intelligence does but\nfollow.  If a person feels the presence of a living God after the\nfashion shown by my quotations, your critical arguments, be they\nnever so superior, will vainly set themselves to change his\nfaith.",
        "Please observe, however, that I do not yet say that it is BETTER\nthat the subconscious and non-rational should thus hold primacy\nin the religious realm.  I confine myself to simply pointing out\nthat they do so hold it as a matter of fact.",
        "So much for our sense of the reality of the religious objects.\nLet me now say a brief word more about the attitudes they\ncharacteristically awaken.",
        "We have already agreed that they are SOLEMN; and we have seen\nreason to think that the most distinctive of them is the sort of\njoy which may result in extreme cases from absolute\nself-surrender.  The sense of the kind of object to which the\nsurrender is made has much to do with determining the precise\ncomplexion of the joy; and the whole phenomenon is more complex\nthan any simple formula allows.  In the literature of the\nsubject, sadness and gladness have each been emphasized in turn. \nThe ancient saying that the first maker of the Gods was fear\nreceives voluminous corroboration from every age of religious\nhistory; but none the less does religious history show the part\nwhich joy has evermore tended to play.  Sometimes the joy has\nbeen primary; sometimes secondary, being the gladness of\ndeliverance from the fear. This latter state of things, being the\nmore complex, is also the more complete; and as we proceed, I\nthink we shall have abundant reason for refusing to leave out\neither the sadness or the gladness, if we look at religion with\nthe breadth of view which it demands.  Stated in the completest\npossible terms, a man’s religion involves both moods of\ncontraction and moods of expansion of his being.  But the\nquantitative mixture and order of these moods vary so much from\none age of the world, from one system of thought, and from one\nindividual to another, that you may insist either on the dread\nand the submission, or on the peace and the freedom as the\nessence of the matter, and still remain materially within the\nlimits of the truth.  The constitutionally sombre and the\nconstitutionally sanguine onlooker are bound to emphasize\nopposite aspects of what lies before their eyes.",
        "The constitutionally sombre religious person makes even of his\nreligious peace a very sober thing.  Danger still hovers in the\nair about it.  Flexion and contraction are not wholly checked. \nIt were sparrowlike and childish after our deliverance to explode\ninto twittering laughter and caper-cutting, and utterly to forget\nthe imminent hawk on bough.  Lie low, rather, lie low; for you\nare in the hands of a living God.  In the Book of Job, for\nexample, the impotence of man and the omnipotence of God is the\nexclusive burden of its author’s mind.  “It is as high as heaven;\nwhat canst thou do?–deeper than hell; what canst thou know?”   \nThere is an astringent relish about the truth of this conviction\nwhich some men can feel, and which for them is as near an\napproach as can be made to the feeling of religious joy.",
        "“In Job,” says that coldly truthful writer, the author of Mark\nRutherford, “God reminds us that man is not the measure of his\ncreation.  The world is immense, constructed on no plan or theory\nwhich the intellect of man can grasp. It is TRANSCENDENT\neverywhere.  This is the burden of every verse, and is the secret\nif there be one, of the poem.  Sufficient or insufficient, there\nis nothing more. . . .  God is great, we know not his ways.  He\ntakes from us all we have, but yet if we possess our souls in\npatience, we MAY pass the valley of the shadow, and come out in\nsunlight again.  We may or we may not! . . . What more have we to\nsay now than God said from the whirlwind over two thousand five\nhundred years ago?\"[29]",
        "[29] Mark Rutherford’s Deliverance, London, 1885, pp. 196, 198.",
        "If we turn to the sanguine onlooker, on the other hand, we find\nthat deliverance is felt as incomplete unless the burden be\naltogether overcome and the danger forgotten.  Such onlookers\ngive us definitions that seem to the sombre minds of whom we have\njust been speaking to leave out all the solemnity that makes\nreligious peace so different from merely animal joys.  In the\nopinion of some writers an attitude might be called religious,\nthough no touch were left in it of sacrifice or submission, no\ntendency to flexion, no bowing of the head.  Any “habitual and\nregulated admiration,” says Professor J. R. Seeley,[30] “is\nworthy to be called a religion\"; and accordingly he thinks that\nour Music, our Science, and our so-called “Civilization,” as\nthese things are now organized and admiringly believed in, form\nthe more genuine religions of our time.  Certainly the\nunhesitating and unreasoning way in which we feel that we must\ninflict our civilization upon “lower” races, by means of\nHotchkiss guns, etc., reminds one of nothing so much as of the\nearly spirit of Islam spreading its religion by the sword.",

        "In my last lecture I quoted to you the ultra-radical opinion of\nMr. Havelock Ellis, that laughter of any sort may be considered a\nreligious exercise, for it bears witness to the soul’s\nemancipation.  I quoted this opinion in order to deny its\nadequacy.  But we must now settle our scores more carefully with\nthis whole optimistic way of thinking.  It is far too complex to\nbe decided off-hand.  I propose accordingly that we make of\nreligious optimism the theme of the next two lectures.",
        "If we were to ask the question:  “What is human life’s chief\nconcern?” one of the answers we should receive would be:  “It is\nhappiness.”  How to gain, how to keep, how to recover happiness,\nis in fact for most men at all times the secret motive of all\nthey do, and of all they are willing to endure.  The hedonistic\nschool in ethics deduces the moral life wholly from the\nexperiences of happiness and unhappiness which different kinds of\nconduct bring; and, even more in the religious life than in the\nmoral life, happiness and unhappiness seem to be the poles round\nwhich the interest revolves. We need not go so far as to say with\nthe author whom I lately quoted that any persistent enthusiasm\nis, as such, religion, nor need we call mere laughter a religious\nexercise; but we must admit that any persistent enjoyment may\nPRODUCE the sort of religion which consists in a grateful\nadmiration of the gift of so happy an existence; and we must also\nacknowledge that the more complex ways of experiencing religion\nare new manners of producing happiness, wonderful inner paths to\na supernatural kind of happiness, when the first gift of natural\nexistence is unhappy, as it so often proves itself to be.",
        "With such relations between religion and happiness, it is perhaps\nnot surprising that men come to regard the happiness which a\nreligious belief affords as a proof of its truth.  If a creed\nmakes a man feel happy, he almost inevitably adopts it.  Such a\nbelief ought to be true; therefore it is true–such, rightly or\nwrongly, is one of the “immediate inferences” of the religious\nlogic used by ordinary men.",
        "“The near presence of God’s spirit,” says a German writer,[31]\n\"may be experienced in its reality–indeed ONLY experienced. And\nthe mark by which the spirit’s existence and nearness are made\nirrefutably clear to those who have ever had the experience is\nthe utterly incomparable FEELING OF HAPPINESS which is connected\nwith the nearness, and which is therefore not only a possible and\naltogether proper feeling for us to have here below, but is the\nbest and most indispensable proof of God’s reality.  No other\nproof is equally convincing, and therefore happiness is the point\nfrom which every efficacious new theology should start.”",
        "[31] C. Hilty: Gluck, dritter Theil, 1900, p. 18.",
        "In the hour immediately before us, I shall invite you to consider\nthe simpler kinds of religious happiness, leaving the more\ncomplex sorts to be treated on a later day.",
        "In many persons, happiness is congenital and irreclaimable.\n\"Cosmic emotion” inevitably takes in them the form of enthusiasm\nand freedom.  I speak not only of those who are animally happy. \nI mean those who, when unhappiness is offered or proposed to\nthem, positively refuse to feel it, as if it were something mean\nand wrong.  We find such persons in every age, passionately\nflinging themselves upon their sense of the goodness of life, in\nspite of the hardships of their own condition, and in spite of\nthe sinister theologies into which they may he born.  From the\noutset their religion is one of union with the divine.  The\nheretics who went before the reformation are lavishly accused by\nthe church writers of antinomian practices, just as the first\nChristians were accused of indulgence in orgies by the Romans. \nIt is probable that there never has been a century in which the\ndeliberate refusal to think ill of life has not been idealized by\na sufficient number of persons to form sects, open or secret, who\nclaimed all natural things to be permitted.  Saint Augustine’s\nmaxim, Dilige et quod vis fac–if you but love [God], you may do\nas you incline–is morally one of the profoundest of\nobservations, yet it is pregnant, for such persons, with\npassports beyond the bounds of conventional morality.  According\nto their characters they have been refined or gross; but their\nbelief has been at all times systematic enough to constitute a\ndefinite religious attitude.  God was for them a giver of\nfreedom, and the sting of evil was overcome.  Saint Francis and\nhis immediate disciples were, on the whole, of this company of\nspirits, of which there are of course infinite varieties. \nRousseau in the earlier years of his writing, Diderot, B. de\nSaint Pierre, and many of the leaders of the eighteenth century\nanti-Christian movement were of this optimistic type. They owed\ntheir influence to a certain authoritativeness in their feeling\nthat Nature, if you will only trust her sufficiently, is\nabsolutely good.",
        "It is to be hoped that we all have some friend, perhaps more\noften feminine than masculine, and young than old, whose soul is\nof this sky-blue tint, whose affinities are rather with flowers\nand birds and all enchanting innocencies than with dark human\npassions, who can think no ill of man or God, and in whom\nreligious gladness, being in possession from the outset, needs no\ndeliverance from any antecedent burden.",
        "“God has two families of children on this earth,” says Francis W.\nNewman,[32] “the once-born and the twice-born,” and the once-born\nhe describes as follows:  “They see God, not as a strict Judge,\nnot as a Glorious Potentate; but as the animating Spirit of a\nbeautiful harmonious world, Beneficent and Kind, Merciful as well\nas Pure.  The same characters generally have no metaphysical\ntendencies:  they do not look back into themselves. Hence they\nare not distressed by their own imperfections:  yet it would be\nabsurd to call them self-righteous; for they hardly think of\nthemselves AT ALL.  This childlike quality of their nature makes\nthe opening of religion very happy to them:  for they no more\nshrink from God, than a child from an emperor, before whom the\nparent trembles:  in fact, they have no vivid conception of ANY\nof the qualities in which the severer Majesty of God\nconsists.[33] He is to them the impersonation of Kindness and\nBeauty.  They read his character, not in the disordered world of\nman, but in romantic and harmonious nature. Of human sin they\nknow perhaps little in their own hearts and not very much in the\nworld; and human suffering does but melt them to tenderness. \nThus, when they approach God, no inward disturbance ensues; and\nwithout being as yet spiritual, they have a certain complacency\nand perhaps romantic sense of excitement in their simple\nworship.”",

        "In the Romish Church such characters find a more congenial soil\nto grow in than in Protestantism, whose fashions of feeling have\nbeen set by minds of a decidedly pessimistic order.  But even in\nProtestantism they have been abundant enough; and in its recent\n\"liberal” developments of Unitarianism and latitudinarianism\ngenerally, minds of this order have played and still are playing\nleading and constructive parts.  Emerson himself is an admirable\nexample.  Theodore Parker is another–here are a couple of\ncharacteristic passages from Parker’s correspondence.[34]",

        "“Orthodox scholars say:  ’In the heathen classics you find no\nconsciousness of sin.’ It is very true–God be thanked for it.\nThey were conscious of wrath, of cruelty, avarice, drunkenness,\nlust, sloth, cowardice, and other actual vices, and struggled and\ngot rid of the deformities, but they were not conscious of\n’enmity against God,’ and didn’t sit down and whine and groan\nagainst non-existent evil.  I have done wrong things enough in my\nlife, and do them now; I miss the mark, draw bow, and try again. \nBut I am not conscious of hating God, or man, or right, or love,\nand I know there is much ’health in me’, and in my body, even\nnow, there dwelleth many a good thing, spite of consumption and\nSaint Paul.”  In another letter Parker writes:  “I have swum in\nclear sweet waters all my days; and if sometimes they were a\nlittle cold, and the stream ran adverse and something rough, it\nwas never too strong to be breasted and swum through.  From the\ndays of earliest boyhood, when I went stumbling through the\ngrass, . . . up to the gray-bearded manhood of this time, there\nis none but has left me honey in the hive of memory that I now\nfeed on for present delight. When I recall the years . . . I am\nfilled with a sense of sweetness and wonder that such little\nthings can make a mortal so exceedingly rich.  But I must confess\nthat the chiefest of all my delights is still the religious.”",
        "Another good expression of the “once-born\" type of consciousness,\ndeveloping straight and natural, with no element of morbid\ncompunction or crisis, is contained in the answer of Dr. Edward\nEverett Hale, the eminent Unitarian preacher and writer, to one\nof Dr. Starbuck’s circulars.  I quote a part of it:–",
        "“I observe, with profound regret, the religious struggles which\ncome into many biographies, as if almost essential to the\nformation of the hero.  I ought to speak of these, to say that\nany man has an advantage, not to be estimated, who is born, as I\nwas, into a family where the religion is simple and rational; who\nis trained in the theory of such a religion, so that he never\nknows, for an hour, what these religious or irreligious struggles\nare.  I always knew God loved me, and I was always grateful to\nhim for the world he placed me in.  I always liked to tell him\nso, and was always glad to receive his suggestions to me. . . . I\ncan remember perfectly that when I was coming to manhood, the\nhalf-philosophical novels of the time had a deal to say about the\nyoung men and maidens who were facing the ’problem of life.’ I\nhad no idea whatever what the problem of life was.  To live with\nall my might seemed to me easy; to learn where there was so much\nto learn seemed pleasant and almost of course; to lend a hand, if\none had a chance, natural; and if one did this, why, he enjoyed\nlife because he could not help it, and without proving to himself\nthat he ought to enjoy it. . . . A child who is early taught that\nhe is God’s child, that he may live and move and have his being\nin God, and that he has, therefore, infinite strength at hand for\nthe conquering of any difficulty, will take life more easily, and\nprobably will make more of it, than one who is told that he is\nborn the child of wrath and wholly incapable of good.\"[35]",

        "“His favorite occupation,” writes his disciple, Dr. Bucke “seemed\nto be strolling or sauntering about outdoors by himself, looking\nat the grass, the trees, the flowers, the vistas of light, the\nvarying aspects of the sky, and listening to the birds, the\ncrickets, the tree frogs, and all the hundreds of natural sounds.",
        "It was evident that these things gave him a pleasure far beyond\nwhat they give to ordinary people.  Until I knew the man,\"\ncontinues Dr. Bucke, “it had not occurred to me that any one\ncould derive so much absolute happiness from these things as he\ndid.  He was very fond of flowers, either wild or cultivated;\nliked all sorts.  I think he admired lilacs and sunflowers just\nas much as roses.  Perhaps, indeed, no man who ever lived liked\nso many things and disliked so few as Walt Whitman.  All natural\nobjects seemed to have a charm for him.  All sights and sounds\nseemed to please him.  He appeared to like (and I believe he did\nlike) all the men, women, and children he saw (though I never\nknew him to say that he liked any one), but each who knew him\nfelt that he liked him or her, and that he liked others also.  I\nnever knew him to argue or dispute, and he never spoke about\nmoney.  He always justified, sometimes playfully, sometimes quite\nseriously, those who spoke harshly of himself or his writings,\nand I often thought he even took pleasure in the opposition of\nenemies.  When I first knew [him], I used to think that he\nwatched himself, and would not allow his tongue to give\nexpression to fretfulness, antipathy, complaint, and\nremonstrance.  It did not occur to me as possible that these\nmental states could be absent in him.  After long observation,\nhowever, I satisfied myself that such absence or unconsciousness\nwas entirely real.  He never spoke deprecatingly of any\nnationality or class of men, or time in the world’s history, or\nagainst any trades or occupations–not even against any animals,\ninsects, or inanimate things, nor any of the laws of nature, nor\nany of the results of those laws, such as illness, deformity, and\ndeath.  He never complained or grumbled either at the weather,\npain, illness, or anything else.  He never swore.  He could not\nvery well, since he never spoke in anger and apparently never was\nangry.  He never exhibited fear, and I do not believe he ever\nfelt it.\"[38]",

        "Walt Whitman owes his importance in literature to the systematic\nexpulsion from his writings of all contractile elements.  The\nonly sentiments he allowed himself to express were of the\nexpansive order; and he expressed these in the first person, not\nas your mere monstrously conceited individual might so express\nthem, but vicariously for all men, so that a passionate and\nmystic ontological emotion suffuses his words, and ends by\npersuading the reader that men and women, life and death, and all\nthings are divinely good.",
        "Thus it has come about that many persons to-day regard Walt\nWhitman as the restorer of the eternal natural religion. He has\ninfected them with his own love of comrades, with his own\ngladness that he and they exist.  Societies are actually formed\nfor his cult; a periodical organ exists for its propagation, in\nwhich the lines of orthodoxy and heterodoxy are already beginning\nto be drawn;[39] hymns are written by others in his peculiar\nprosody; and he is even explicitly compared with the founder of\nthe Christian religion, not altogether to the advantage of the\nlatter.",

In neither of these senses does it\nfitly define this poet.  He is more than your mere animal man who\nhas not tasted of the tree of good and evil.  He is aware enough\nof sin for a swagger to be present in his indifference towards\nit, a conscious pride in his freedom from flexions and\ncontractions, which your genuine pagan in the first sense of the\nword would never show.",

        "No natural pagan could have written these well-known lines.  But\non the other hand Whitman is less than a Greek or Roman; for\ntheir consciousness, even in Homeric times, was full to the brim\nof the sad mortality of this sunlit world, and such a\nconsciousness Walt Whitman resolutely refuses to adopt.  When,\nfor example, Achilles, about to slay Lycaon, Priam’s young son,\nhears him sue for mercy, he stops to say:–",
        "“Ah, friend, thou too must die:  why thus lamentest thou?\nPatroclos too is dead, who was better far than thou. . . . Over\nme too hang death and forceful fate.  There cometh morn or eve or\nsome noonday when my life too some man shall take in battle,\nwhether with spear he smite, or arrow from the string.\"[41]",

        "Then Achilles savagely severs the poor boy’s neck with his sword,\nheaves him by the foot into the Scamander, and calls to the\nfishes of the river to eat the white fat of Lycaon.  Just as here\nthe cruelty and the sympathy each ring true, and do not mix or\ninterfere with one another, so did the Greeks and Romans keep all\ntheir sadnesses and gladnesses unmingled and entire.  Instinctive\ngood they did not reckon sin; nor had they any such desire to\nsave the credit of the universe as to make them insist, as so\nmany of US insist, that what immediately appears as evil must be\n\"good in the making,” or something equally ingenious.  Good was\ngood, and bad just bad, for the earlier Greeks.  They neither\ndenied the ills of nature–Walt Whitman’s verse, “What is called\ngood is perfect and what is called bad is just as perfect,” would\nhave been mere silliness to them–nor did they, in order to\nescape from those ills, invent “another and a better world” of\nthe imagination, in which, along with the ills, the innocent\ngoods of sense would also find no place.  This integrity of the\ninstinctive reactions, this freedom from all moral sophistry and\nstrain, gives a pathetic dignity to ancient pagan feeling. And\nthis quality Whitman’s outpourings have not got. His optimism is\ntoo voluntary and defiant; his gospel has a touch of bravado and\nan affected twist,[42] and this diminishes its effect on many\nreaders who yet are well disposed towards optimism, and on the\nwhole quite willing to admit that in important respects Whitman\nis of the genuine lineage of the prophets.",
        "[42] “God is afraid of me!” remarked such a titanic-optimistic\nfriend in my presence one morning when he was feeling\nparticularly hearty and cannibalistic.  The defiance of the\nphrase showed that a Christian education in humility still\nrankled in his breast.",
        "If, then, we give the name of healthy-mindedness to the tendency\nwhich looks on all things and sees that they are good, we find\nthat we must distinguish between a more involuntary and a more\nvoluntary or systematic way of being healthy-minded.  In its\ninvoluntary variety, healthy-mindedness is a way of feeling happy\nabout things immediately.  In its systematical variety, it is an\nabstract way of conceiving things as good.  Every abstract way of\nconceiving things selects some one aspect of them as their\nessence for the time being, and disregards the other aspects. \nSystematic healthy-mindedness, conceiving good as the essential\nand universal aspect of being, deliberately excludes evil from\nits field of vision; and although, when thus nakedly stated, this\nmight seem a difficult feat to perform for one who is\nintellectually sincere with himself and honest about facts, a\nlittle reflection shows that the situation is too complex to lie\nopen to so simple a criticism.",
        "In the first place, happiness, like every other emotional state,\nhas blindness and insensibility to opposing facts given it as its\ninstinctive weapon for self-protection against disturbance. When\nhappiness is actually in possession, the thought of evil can no\nmore acquire the feeling of reality than the thought of good can\ngain reality when melancholy rules.  To the man actively happy,\nfrom whatever cause, evil simply cannot then and there be\nbelieved in.  He must ignore it; and to the bystander he may then\nseem perversely to shut his eyes to it and hush it up.",
        "But more than this:  the hushing of it up may, in a perfectly\ncandid and honest mind, grow into a deliberate religious policy,\nor parti pris.  Much of what we call evil is due entirely to the\nway men take the phenomenon.  It can so often be converted into a\nbracing and tonic good by a simple change of the sufferer’s inner\nattitude from one of fear to one of fight; its sting so often\ndeparts and turns into a relish when, after vainly seeking to\nshun it, we agree to face about and bear it cheerfully, that a\nman is simply bound in honor, with reference to many of the facts\nthat seem at first to disconcert his peace, to adopt this way of\nescape.  Refuse to admit their badness; despise their power;\nignore their presence; turn your attention the other way; and so\nfar as you yourself are concerned at any rate, though the facts\nmay still exist, their evil character exists no longer.  Since\nyou make them evil or good by your own thoughts about them, it is\nthe ruling of your thoughts which proves to be your principal\nconcern.",
        "The deliberate adoption of an optimistic turn of mind thus makes\nits entrance into philosophy.  And once in, it is hard to trace\nits lawful bounds.  Not only does the human instinct for\nhappiness, bent on self-protection by ignoring, keep working in\nits favor, but higher inner ideals have weighty words to say. \nThe attitude of unhappiness is not only painful, it is mean and\nugly.  What can be more base and unworthy than the pining,\npuling, mumping mood, no matter by what outward ills it may have\nbeen engendered? What is more injurious to others?  What less\nhelpful as a way out of the difficulty?  It but fastens and\nperpetuates the trouble which occasioned it, and increases the\ntotal evil of the situation.  At all costs, then, we ought to\nreduce the sway of that mood; we ought to scout it in ourselves\nand others, and never show it tolerance.  But it is impossible to\ncarry on this discipline in the subjective sphere without\nzealously emphasizing the brighter and minimizing the darker\naspects of the objective sphere of things at the same time.  And\nthus our resolution not to indulge in misery, beginning at a\ncomparatively small point within ourselves, may not stop until it\nhas brought the entire frame of reality under a systematic\nconception optimistic enough to be congenial with its needs.",
        "In all this I say nothing of any mystical insight or persuasion\nthat the total frame of things absolutely must be good.  Such\nmystical persuasion plays an enormous part in the history of the\nreligious consciousness, and we must look at it later with some\ncare.  But we need not go so far at present. More ordinary\nnon-mystical conditions of rapture suffice for my immediate\ncontention.  All invasive moral states and passionate enthusiasms\nmake one feelingless to evil in some direction. The common\npenalties cease to deter the patriot, the usual prudences are\nflung by the lover to the winds.  When the passion is extreme,\nsuffering may actually be gloried in, provided it be for the\nideal cause, death may lose its sting, the grave its victory.  In\nthese states, the ordinary contrast of good and ill seems to be\nswallowed up in a higher denomination, an omnipotent excitement\nwhich engulfs the evil, and which the human being welcomes as the\ncrowning experience of his life.  This, he says, is truly to\nlive, and I exult in the heroic opportunity and adventure.",
        "The systematic cultivation of healthy-mindedness as a religious\nattitude is therefore consonant with important currents in human\nnature, and is anything but absurd.  In fact. we all do cultivate\nit more or less, even when our professed theology should in\nconsistency forbid it.  We divert our attention from disease and\ndeath as much as we can; and the slaughter-houses and indecencies\nwithout end on which our life is founded are huddled out of sight\nand never mentioned, so that the world we recognize officially in\nliterature and in society is a poetic fiction far handsomer and\ncleaner and better than the world that really is.[43]",

        "The advance of liberalism, so-called, in Christianity, during the\npast fifty years, may fairly be called a victory of\nhealthy-mindedness within the church over the morbidness with\nwhich the old hell-fire theology was more harmoniously related. \nWe have now whole congregations whose preachers, far from\nmagnifying our consciousness of sin, seem devoted rather to\nmaking little of it.  They ignore, or even deny, eternal\npunishment, and insist on the dignity rather than on the\ndepravity of man.  They look at the continual preoccupation of\nthe old-fashioned Christian with the salvation of his soul as\nsomething sickly and reprehensible rather than admirable; and a\nsanguine and “muscular” attitude. which to our forefathers would\nhave seemed purely heathen, has become in their eyes an ideal\nelement of Christian character. I am not asking whether or not\nthey are right, I am only pointing out the change.  The persons\nto whom I refer have still retained for the most part their\nnominal connection with Christianity, in spite of their\ndiscarding of its more pessimistic theological elements.  But in\nthat “theory of evolution” which, gathering momentum for a\ncentury, has within the past twenty-five years swept so rapidly\nover Europe and America, we see the ground laid for a new sort of\nreligion of Nature, which has entirely displaced Christianity\nfrom the thought of a large part of our generation.  The idea of\na universal evolution lends itself to a doctrine of general\nmeliorism and progress which fits the religious needs of the\nhealthy-minded so well that it seems almost as if it might have\nbeen created for their use.  Accordingly we find “evolutionism\"\ninterpreted thus optimistically and embraced as a substitute for\nthe religion they were born in, by a multitude of our\ncontemporaries who have either been trained scientifically, or\nbeen fond of reading popular science, and who had already begun\nto be inwardly dissatisfied with what seemed to them the\nharshness and irrationality of the orthodox Christian scheme.

Mind-cure might be briefly called a\nreaction against all that religion of chronic anxiety which\nmarked the earlier part of our century in the evangelical circles\nof England and America.",
        "The blind have been made to see, the halt to walk; life-long\ninvalids have had their health restored.  The moral fruits have\nbeen no less remarkable.  The deliberate adoption of a\nhealthy-minded attitude has proved possible to many who never\nsupposed they had it in them; regeneration of character has gone\non on an extensive scale; and cheerfulness has been restored to\ncountless homes.  The indirect influence of this has been great. \nThe mind-cure principles are beginning so to pervade the air that\none catches their spirit at second-hand.

        "Complaints of the weather are getting to be forbidden in many\nhouseholds; and more and more people are recognizing it to be bad\nform to speak of disagreeable sensations, or to make much of the\nordinary inconveniences and ailments of life.  These general\ntonic effects on public opinion would be good even if the more\nstriking results were non-existent.  But the latter abound so\nthat we can afford to overlook the innumerable failures and\nself-deceptions that are mixed in with them (for in everything\nhuman failure is a matter of course), and we can also overlook\nthe verbiage of a good deal of the mind-cure literature, some of\nwhich is so moonstruck with optimism and so vaguely expressed\nthat an academically trained intellect finds it almost impossible\nto read it at all.",
        "The plain fact remains that the spread of the movement has been\ndue to practical fruits, and the extremely practical turn of\ncharacter of the American people has never been better shown than\nby the fact that this, their only decidedly original contribution\nto the systematic philosophy of life, should be so intimately\nknit up with concrete therapeutics.  To the importance of\nmind-cure the medical and clerical professions in the United\nStates are beginning, though with much recalcitrancy and\nprotesting, to open their eyes.  It is evidently bound to develop\nstill farther, both speculatively and practically, and its latest\nwriters are far and away the ablest of the group.[45] It matters\nnothing that, just as there are hosts of persons who cannot pray,\nso there are greater hosts who cannot by any possibility be\ninfluenced by the mind-curers’ ideas.  For our immediate purpose,\nthe important point is that so large a number should exist who \nCAN be so influenced.  They form a psychic type to be studied\nwith respect.[46]",

        "[46] Lest my own testimony be suspected, I will quote another\nreporter, Dr. H. H. Goddard, of Clark University, whose thesis on\n\"the Effects of Mind on Body as evidenced by Faith Cures” is\npublished in the American Journal of Psychology for 1899 (vol.\nx.).  This critic, after a wide study of the facts, concludes\nthat the cures by mind-cure exist, but are in no respect\ndifferent from those now officially recognized in medicine as\ncures by suggestion; and the end of his essay contains an\ninteresting physiological speculation as to the way in which the\nsuggestive ideas may work (p. 67 of the reprint).  As regards the\ngeneral phenomenon of mental cure itself, Dr. Goddard writes: \n\"In spite of the severe criticism we have made of reports of\ncure, there still remains a vast amount of material, showing a\npowerful influence of the mind in disease.  Many cases are of\ndiseases that have been diagnosed and treated by the best\nphysicians of the country, or which prominent hospitals have\ntried their hand at curing, but without success.  People of\nculture and education have been treated by this method with\nsatisfactory results.  Diseases of long standing have been\nameliorated, and even cured. . . . We have traced the mental\nelement through primitive medicine and folk-medicine of to-day,\npatent medicine, and witchcraft.  We are convinced that it is\nimpossible to account for the existence of these practices, if\nthey did not cure disease, and that if they cured disease, it\nmust have been the mental element that was effective.  The same\nargument applies to those modern schools of mental therapeutics–\nDivine Healing and Christian Science.  It is hardly conceivable\nthat the large body of intelligent people who comprise the body\nknown distinctively as Mental Scientists should continue to exist\nif the whole thing were a delusion.  It is not a thing of a day;\nit is not confined to a few; it is not local.  It is true that\nmany failures are recorded, but that only adds to the argument. \nThere must be many and striking successes to counterbalance the\nfailures, otherwise the failures would have ended the delusion. .\n. . Christian Science, Divine Healing, or Mental Science do not,\nand never can in the very nature of things, cure all diseases;\nnevertheless, the practical applications of the general\nprinciples of the broadest mental science will tend to prevent\ndisease. . . . We do find sufficient evidence to convince us\nthat the proper reform in mental attitude would relieve many a\nsufferer of ills that the ordinary physician cannot touch; would\neven delay the approach of death to many a victim beyond the\npower of absolute cure, and the faithful adherence to a truer\nphilosophy of life will keep many a man well, and give the doctor\ntime to devote to alleviating ills that are unpreventable” (pp.\n33, 34 of reprint).",
        "To come now to a little closer quarters with their creed.  The\nfundamental pillar on which it rests is nothing more than the\ngeneral basis of all religious experience, the fact that man has\na dual nature, and is connected with two spheres of thought, a\nshallower and a profounder sphere, in either of which he may\nlearn to live more habitually.  The shallower and lower sphere is\nthat of the fleshly sensations, instincts, and desires, of\negotism, doubt, and the lower personal interests.  But whereas\nChristian theology has always considered FROWARDNESS to be the\nessential vice of this part of human nature, the mind-curers say\nthat the mark of the beast in it is FEAR; and this is what gives\nsuch an entirely new religious turn to their persuasion.",
        "“Fear,” to quote a writer of the school, “has had its uses in the\nevolutionary process, and seems to constitute the whole of\nforethought in most animals; but that it should remain any part\nof the mental equipment of human civilized life is an absurdity. \nI find that the fear clement of forethought is not stimulating to\nthose more civilized persons to whom duty and attraction are the\nnatural motives, but is weakening and deterrent.  As soon as it\nbecomes unnecessary, fear becomes a positive deterrent, and\nshould be entirely removed, as dead flesh is removed from living\ntissue.  To assist in the analysis of fear and in the\ndenunciation of its expressions, I have coined the word\nfearthought to stand for the unprofitable element of forethought,\nand have defined the word ’worry’ as fearthought in\ncontradistinction to forethought.  I have also defined\nfearthought as the self-imposed or self-permitted suggestion of\ninferiority, in order to place it where it really belongs, in the\ncategory of harmful, unnecessary, and therefore not respectable\nthings.\"[47]",

        "There are certain social conventions or customs and alleged\nrequirements, there is a theological bias, a general view of the\nworld.  There are conservative ideas in regard to our early\ntraining, our education, marriage, and occupation in life.\nFollowing close upon this, there is a long series of\nanticipations, namely, that we shall suffer certain children’s\ndiseases, diseases of middle life, and of old age; the thought\nthat we shall grow old, lose our faculties, and again become\nchildlike; while crowning all is the fear of death.  Then there\nis a long line of particular tears and trouble-bearing\nexpectations, such, for example, as ideas associated with certain\narticles of food, the dread of the east wind, the terrors of hot\nweather, the aches and pains associated with cold weather, the\nfear of catching cold if one sits in a draught, the coming of\nhay-fever upon the 14th of August in the middle of the day, and\nso on through a long list of fears, dreads, worriments,\nanxieties, anticipations, expectations, pessimisms, morbidities,\nand the whole ghostly train of fateful shapes which our\nfellow-men, and especially physicians, are ready to help us\nconjure up, an array worthy to rank with Bradley’s ’unearthly\nballet of bloodless categories.’",

        "[50] Whether it differs so much from Christ’s own notion is for\nthe exegetists to decide.  According to Harnack, Jesus felt about\nevil and disease much as our mind-curers do.  “What is the answer\nwhich Jesus sends to John the Baptist?” asks Harnack, and says it\nis this:  “’The blind see, and the lame walk, the lepers are\ncleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead rise up, and the gospel is\npreached to the poor.’  That is the ’coming of the kingdom,’ or\nrather in these saving works the kingdom is already there.  By\nthe overcoming and removal of misery, of need, of sickness, by\nthese actual effects John is to see that the new time has\narrived.  The casting out of devils is only a part of this work\nof redemption, but Jesus points to that as the sense and seal of\nhis mission.  Thus to the wretched, sick, and poor did he address\nhimself, but not as a moralist, and without a trace of\nsentimentalism.  He never makes groups and departments of the\nills, he never spends time in asking whether the sick one\n’deserves’ to be cured; and it never occurs to him to sympathize\nwith the pain or the death.  He nowhere says that sickness is a\nbeneficent infliction, and that evil has a healthy use.  No, he\ncalls sickness sickness and health health.  All evil, all\nwretchedness, is for him something dreadful; it is of the great\nkingdom of Satan; but he feels the power of the saviour within\nhim.  He knows that advance is possible only when weakness is\novercome, when sickness is made well.”  Das Wesen des\nChristenthums, 1900, p. 39.",
        "Their notion of man’s higher nature is hardly less divergent,\nbeing decidedly pantheistic.  The spiritual in man appears \nin the mind-cure philosophy as partly conscious, but chiefly\nsubconscious; and through the subconscious part of it we are\nalready one with the Divine without any miracle of grace, or\nabrupt creation of a new inner man.  As this view is variously\nexpressed by different writers, we find in it traces of Christian\nmysticism, of transcendental idealism, of vedantism, and of the\nmodern psychology of the subliminal self.  A quotation or two\nwill put us at the central point of view:–",
        "“The great central fact of the universe is that spirit of\ninfinite life and power that is back of all, that manifests\nitself in and through all.  This spirit of infinite life and\npower that is back of all is what I call God.  I care not what\nterm you may use, be it Kindly Light, Providence, the Over-Soul,\nOmnipotence, or whatever term may be most convenient, so long as\nwe are agreed in regard to the great central fact itself.  God\nthen fills the universe alone, so that all is from Him and in\nHim, and there is nothing that is outside.  He is the life of our\nlife our very life itself.  We are partakers of the life of God;\nand though we differ from Him in that we are individualized\nspirits, while He is the Infinite Spirit, including us, as well\nas all else beside, yet in essence the life of God and the life\nof man are identically the same, and so are one.  They differ not\nin essence or quality; they differ in degree.",
        "“The great central fact in human life is the coming into a\nconscious vital realization of our oneness with this Infinite\nLife and the opening of ourselves fully to this divine inflow. \nIn just the degree that we come into a conscious realization of\nour oneness with the Infinite Life, and open ourselves to this\ndivine inflow, do we actualize in ourselves the qualities and\npowers of the Infinite Life, do we make ourselves channels\nthrough which the Infinite Intelligence and Power can work.  In\njust the degree in which you realize your oneness with the\nInfinite Spirit, you will exchange dis-ease for ease, inharmony\nfor harmony, suffering and pain for abounding health and\nstrength.  To recognize our own divinity, and our intimate\nrelation to the Universal, is to attach the belts of our\nmachinery to the powerhouse of the Universe.  One need remain in\nhell no longer than one chooses to; we can rise to any heaven we\nourselves choose; and when we choose so to rise, all the higher\npowers of the Universe combine to help us heavenward.\"[51]",

        "“The first underlying cause of all sickness, weakness, or\ndepression is the human sense of separateness from that Divine\nEnergy which we call God.  The soul which can feel and affirm in\nserene but jubilant confidence, as did the Nazarene:  ’I and my\nFather are one,’ has no further need of healer, or of healing.\nThis is the whole truth in a nutshell, and other foundation for\nwholeness can no man lay than this fact of impregnable divine\nunion.  Disease can no longer attack one whose feet are planted\non this rock, who feels hourly, momently, the influx of the\nDeific Breath.  If one with Omnipotence, how can weariness enter\nthe consciousness, how illness assail that indomitable spark?",

My thoughts were no more impure than\nthey are to-day, although my belief in the necessity of illness\nwas dense and unenlightened; but since my resurrection in the\nflesh, I have worked as a healer unceasingly for fourteen years\nwithout a vacation, and can truthfully assert that I have never\nknown a moment of fatigue or pain, although coming in touch\nconstantly with excessive weakness, illness, and disease of all\nkinds.

This\nis almost unrecognizable unless we live it into ourselves\nACTUALLY, that is, by a constant turning to the very innermost,\ndeepest consciousness of our real selves or of God in us, for\nillumination from within, just as we turn to the sun for light,\nwarmth, and invigoration without.  When you do this consciously,\nrealizing that to turn inward to the light within you is to live\nin the presence of God or your divine self, you soon discover the\nunreality of the objects to which you have hitherto been turning\nand which have engrossed you without.",
        "“I have come to disregard the meaning of this attitude for bodily\nhealth AS SUCH, because that comes of itself, as an incidental\nresult, and cannot be found by any special mental act or desire\nto have it, beyond that general attitude of mind I have referred\nto above.  That which we usually make the object of life, those\nouter things we are all so wildly seeking, which we so often live\nand die for, but which then do not give us peace and happiness,\nthey should all come of themselves as accessory, and as the mere\noutcome or natural result of a far higher life sunk deep in the\nbosom of the spirit.  This life is the real seeking of the\nkingdom of God, the desire for his supremacy in our hearts, so\nthat all else comes as that which shall be ’added unto you’–as\nquite incidental and as a surprise to us, perhaps; and yet it is\nthe proof of the reality of the perfect poise in the very centre\nof our being.",
        "“When I say that we commonly make the object of our life that\nwhich we should not work for primarily, I mean many things which\nthe world considers praiseworthy and excellent, such as success\nin business, fame as author or artist, physician or lawyer, or\nrenown in philanthropic undertakings.  Such things should be\nresults, not objects.  I would also include pleasures of many\nkinds which seem harmless and good at the time, and are pursued\nbecause many accept them–I mean conventionalities,\nsociabilities, and fashions in their various development, these\nbeing mostly approved by the masses, although they may be unreal,\nand even unhealthy superfluities.”",

I\nbelieved them in spite of myself and of my suffering and\nweakness, which continued until Christmas, when I returned to\nBoston.  Within two days a young friend offered to take me to a\nmental healer (this was January 7, 1881).  The healer said: \n’There is nothing but Mind; we are expressions of the One Mind;\nbody is only a mortal belief; as a man thinketh so is he.’ I\ncould not accept all she said, but I translated all that was\nthere for ME in this way:  ’There is nothing but God; I am\ncreated by Him, and am absolutely dependent upon Him; mind is\ngiven me to use; and by just so much of it as I will put upon the\nthought of right action in body I  shall be lifted out of bondage\nto my ignorance and fear and past experience.’  That day I\ncommenced accordingly to take a little of every food provided for\nthe family, constantly saying to myself:  ’The Power that created\nthe stomach must take care of what I have eaten.’  By holding\nthese suggestions through the evening I went to bed and fell\nasleep, saying:  ’I am soul, spirit, just one with God’s Thought\nof me,’ and slept all night without waking, for the first time in\nseveral years [the distress-turns had usually recurred about two\no’clock in the night].  I felt the next day like an escaped\nprisoner, and believed I had found the secret that would in time\ngive me perfect health.  Within ten days I was able to eat\nanything provided for others, and after two weeks I began to have\nmy own positive mental suggestions of Truth, which were to me\nlike stepping-stones.

Then came the conviction, the inner\nconsciousness, that I was perfectly well and always had been, for\nI was Soul, an expression of God’s Perfect Thought.  That was to\nme the perfect and completed separation between what I was and\nwhat I appeared to be.

Its doctrine of the\noneness of our life with God’s life is in fact quite\nindistinguishable from an interpretation of Christ’s message\nwhich in these very Gifford lectures has been defended by some of\nyour very ablest Scottish religious philosophers.[52]",
        "[52] The Cairds, for example.  In Edward Caird’s Glasgow Lectures\nof 1890-92 passages like this abound:–",
        "“The declaration made in the beginning of the ministry of Jesus\nthat ’the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of heaven is at\nhand,’ passes with scarce a break into the announcement that ’the\nkingdom of God is among you’; and the importance of this\nannouncement is asserted to be such that it makes, so to speak, a\ndifference IN KIND between the greatest saints and prophets who\nlived under the previous reign of division, and ’the least in the\nkingdom of heaven.’  The highest ideal is brought close to men\nand declared to be within their reach, they are called on to be\n’perfect as their Father in heaven is perfect.’  The sense of\nalienation and distance from God which had grown upon the pious\nin Israel just in proportion as they had learned to look upon Him\nas no mere national divinity, but as a God of justice who would\npunish Israel for its sin as certainly as Edom or Moab, is\ndeclared to be no longer in place; and the typical form of\nChristian prayer points to the abolition of the contrast between\nthis world and the next which through all the history of the Jews\nhad continually been growing wider:  ’As in heaven, so on earth.’\nThe sense of the division of man from God, as a finite being from\nthe Infinite, as weak and sinful from the Omnipotent Goodness, is\nnot indeed lost; but it can no longer overpower the consciousness\nof oneness.  The terms ’Son’ and ’Father’ at once state the\nopposition and mark its limit.  They show that it is not an\nabsolute opposition, but one which presupposes an indestructible\nprinciple of unity, that can and must become a principle of\nreconciliation.” The Evolution of Religion, ii.  pp. 146, 147.",
        "But philosophers usually profess to give a quasi-logical\nexplanation of the existence of evil, whereas of the general fact\nof evil in the world, the existence of the selfish, suffering, \ntimorous finite consciousness, the mind-curers, so far as I am\nacquainted with them, profess to give no speculative explanation\nEvil is empirically there for them as it is for everybody, but\nthe practical point of view predominates, and it would ill agree\nwith the spirit of their system to spend time in worrying over it\nas a “mystery” or “problem,” or in “laying to heart” the lesson\nof its experience, after the manner of the Evangelicals.  Don’t\nreason about it, as Dante says, but give a glance and pass\nbeyond!  It is Avidhya, ignorance! something merely to be\noutgrown and left be hind, transcended and forgotten.  Christian\nScience so-called, the sect of Mrs. Eddy, is the most radical\nbranch of mind-cure in its dealings with evil.  For it evil is\nsimply a LIE, and any one who mentions it is a liar.  The\noptimistic ideal of duty forbids us to pay it the compliment even\nof explicit attention.  Of course, as our next lectures will show\nus, this is a bad speculative omission, but it is intimately\nlinked with the practical merits of the system we are examining. \nWhy regret a philosophy of evil, a mind-curer would ask us, if I\ncan put you in possession of a life of good?",
        "After all, it is the life that tells; and mind-cure has developed\na living system of mental hygiene which may well claim to have\nthrown all previous literature of the Diatetit der Seele into the\nshade.  This system is wholly and exclusively compacted of\noptimism:  “Pessimism leads to weakness. Optimism leads to\npower.”    “Thoughts are things,” as one of the most vigorous\nmind-cure writers prints in bold type at the bottom of each of\nhis pages; and if your thoughts are of health, youth, vigor, and\nsuccess, before you know it these things will also be your\noutward portion.  No one can fail of the regenerative influence\nof optimistic thinking, pertinaciously pursued.  Every man owns\nindefeasibly this inlet to the divine.  Fear, on the contrary,\nand all the contracted and egoistic modes of thought, are inlets\nto destruction.  Most mind-curers here bring in a doctrine that\nthoughts are “forces,” and that, by virtue of a law that like\nattracts like, one man’s thoughts draw to themselves as allies\nall the thoughts of the same character that exist the world over.\nThus one gets, by one’s thinking, reinforcements from elsewhere\nfor the realization of one’s desires; and the great point in the\nconduct of life is to get the heavenly forces on one’s side by\nopening one’s own mind to their influx.",
        "On the whole, one is struck by a psychological similarity between\nthe mind-cure movement and the Lutheran and Wesleyan movements. \nTo the believer in moralism and works, with his anxious query,\n\"What shall I do to be saved?”  Luther and Wesley replied:  “You\nare saved now, if you would but believe it.”  And the mind-curers\ncome with precisely similar words of emancipation.  They speak,\nit is true, to persons for whom the conception of salvation has\nlost its ancient theological meaning, but who labor nevertheless\nwith the same eternal human difficulty.  THINGS ARE WRONG WITH\nTHEM; and “What shall I do to be clear, right, sound, whole,\nwell?” is the form of their question.  And the answer is:  “You\nARE well, sound, and clear already, if you did but know it.” \n\"The whole matter may be summed up in one sentence,” says one of\nthe authors whom I have already quoted, “GOD IS WELL, AND SO ARE\nYOU.  You must awaken to the knowledge of your real being.”",
        "The adequacy of their message to the mental needs of a large\nfraction of mankind is what gave force to those earlier gospels. \nExactly the same adequacy holds in the case of the mind-cure\nmessage, foolish as it may sound upon its surface; and seeing its\nrapid growth in influence, and its therapeutic triumphs, one is\ntempted to ask whether it may not be destined (probably by very\nreason of the crudity and extravagance of many of its\nmanifestations[53]) to play a part almost  as great in the\nevolution of the popular religion of the future as did those\nearlier movements in their day.",
        "[53] It remains to be seen whether the school of Mr. Dresser,\nwhich assumes more and more the form of mind-cure experience and\nacademic philosophy mutually impregnating each other, will score\nthe practical triumphs of the less critical and rational sects.",
        "But I here fear that I may begin to “jar upon the nerves” of some\nof the members of this academic audience.  Such contemporary\nvagaries, you may think, should hardly take so large a place in\ndignified Gifford lectures.  I can only beseech you to have\npatience.  The whole outcome of these lectures will, I imagine,\nbe the emphasizing to your mind of the enormous diversities which\nthe spiritual lives of different men exhibit.  Their wants, their\nsusceptibilities, and their capacities all vary and must be\nclassed under different heads.  The result is that we have really\ndifferent types of religious experience; and, seeking in these\nlectures closer acquaintance with the healthy-minded type, we\nmust take it where we find it in most radical form.  The\npsychology of individual types of character has hardly begun even\nto be sketched as yet–our lectures may possibly serve as a\ncrumb-like contribution to the structure.  The first thing to\nbear in mind (especially if we ourselves belong to the\nclerico-academic-scientific type, the officially and\nconventionally “correct\" type, “the deadly respectable\" type, for\nwhich to ignore others is a besetting temptation) is that nothing\ncan be more stupid than to bar out phenomena from our notice,\nmerely because we are incapable of taking part in anything like\nthem ourselves.",
        "Now the history of Lutheran salvation by faith, of methodistic\nconversions, and of what I call the mind-cure movement seems to\nprove the existence of numerous persons in whom–at any rate at a\ncertain stage in their development–a change of character for the\nbetter, so far from being facilitated by the rules laid down by\nofficial moralists, will take place all the more successfully if\nthose rules be exactly reversed.  Official moralists advise us\nnever to relax our strenuousness.  “Be vigilant, day and night,\"\nthey adjure us; “hold your passive tendencies in check; shrink\nfrom no effort; keep your will like a bow always bent.”  But the\npersons I speak of find that all this conscious effort leads to\nnothing but failure and vexation in their hands, and only makes\nthem twofold more the children of hell they were before.  The\ntense and voluntary attitude becomes in them an impossible fever\nand torment.  Their machinery refuses to run at all when the\nbearings are made so hot and the belts so tight.",
        "Under these circumstances the way to success, as vouched for by\ninnumerable authentic personal narrations, is by an\nanti-moralistic method, by the “surrender” of which I spoke in my\nsecond lecture.  Passivity, not activity; relaxation, not\nintentness, should be now the rule.  Give up the feeling of\nresponsibility, let go your hold, resign the care of your destiny\nto higher powers, be genuinely indifferent as to what becomes of\nit all, and you will find not only that you gain a perfect inward\nrelief, but often also, in addition, the particular goods you\nsincerely thought you were renouncing. This is the salvation\nthrough self-despair, the dying to be truly born, of Lutheran\ntheology, the passage into NOTHING of which Jacob Behmen writes. \nTo get to it, a critical point must usually be passed, a corner\nturned within one.  Something must give way, a native hardness\nmust break down and liquefy; and this event (as we shall\nabundantly see hereafter) is frequently sudden and automatic, and\nleaves on the Subject an impression that he has been wrought on\nby an external power.",
        "Whatever its ultimate significance may prove to be, this is\ncertainly one fundamental form of human experience. Some say that\nthe capacity or incapacity for it is what divides the religious\nfrom the merely moralistic character. With those who undergo it\nin its fullness, no criticism avails to cast doubt on its\nreality.  They KNOW; for they have actually FELT the higher\npowers, in giving up the tension of their personal will.",
        "A story which revivalist preachers often tell is that of a man\nwho found himself at night slipping down the side of a precipice.",
        "At last he caught a branch which stopped his fall, and remained\nclinging to it in misery for hours.  But finally his fingers had\nto loose their hold, and with a despairing farewell to life, he\nlet himself drop.  He fell just six inches.  If he had given up\nthe struggle earlier, his agony would have been spared.  As the\nmother earth received him, so, the preachers tell us, will the\neverlasting arms receive us if we confide absolutely in them, and\ngive up the hereditary habit of relying on our personal strength,\nwith its precautions that cannot shelter and safeguards that\nnever save.",
        "The mind-curers have given the widest scope to this sort of\nexperience.  They have demonstrated that a form of regeneration\nby relaxing, by letting go, psychologically indistinguishable\nfrom the Lutheran justification by faith and the Wesleyan\nacceptance of free grace, is within the reach of persons who have\nno conviction of sin and care nothing for the Lutheran theology. \nIt is but giving your little private convulsive self a rest, and\nfinding that a greater Self is there.  The results, slow or\nsudden, or great or small, of the combined optimism and\nexpectancy, the regenerative phenomena which ensue on the\nabandonment of effort, remain firm facts of human nature, no\nmatter whether we adopt a theistic, a pantheistic-idealistic, or\na medical-materialistic view of their ultimate causal\nexplanation.[54]",
        "[54] The theistic explanation is by divine grace, which creates a\nnew nature within one the moment the old nature is sincerely\ngiven up.  The pantheistic explanation (which is that of most\nmind-curers) is by the merging of the narrower private self into\nthe wider or greater self, the spirit of the universe (which is\nyour own “subconscious” self), the moment the isolating barriers\nof mistrust and anxiety are removed.  The medico-materialistic\nexplanation is that simpler cerebral processes act more freely\nwhere they are left to act automatically by the shunting-out of\nphysiologically (though in this instance not spiritually)\n\"higher” ones which, seeking to regulate, only succeed in\ninhibiting results.–Whether this third explanation might, in a\npsycho-physical account of the universe, be combined with either\nof the others may be left an open question here.",
        "When we take up the phenomena of revivalistic conversion, we\nshall learn something more about all this.  Meanwhile I will say\na brief word about the mind-curer’s METHODS.",
        "They are of course largely suggestive.  The suggestive influence\nof environment plays an enormous part in all spiritual education.",
        "But the word “suggestion,” having acquired official status, is\nunfortunately already beginning to play in many quarters the part\nof a wet blanket upon investigation, being used to fend off all\ninquiry into the varying susceptibilities of individual cases. \n\"Suggestion” is only another name for the power of ideas, SO FAR\nAS THEY PROVE EFFICACIOUS OVER BELIEF AND CONDUCT.  Ideas\nefficacious over some people prove inefficacious over others. \nIdeas efficacious at some times and in some human surroundings\nare not so at other times and elsewhere.  The ideas of Christian\nchurches are not efficacious in the therapeutic direction to-day,\nwhatever they may have been in earlier centuries; and when the\nwhole question is as to why the salt has lost its savor here or\ngained it there, the mere blank waving of the word “suggestion\"\nas if it were a banner gives no light.  Dr. Goddard, whose candid\npsychological essay on Faith Cures ascribes them to nothing but\nordinary suggestion, concludes by saying that “Religion [and by\nthis he seems to mean our popular Christianity] has in it all\nthere is in mental therapeutics, and has it in its best form. \nLiving up to [our religious] ideas will do anything for us that\ncan be done.”  And this in spite of the actual fact that the\npopular Christianity does absolutely NOTHING, or did nothing\nuntil mind-cure came to the rescue.[55]",
        "[55] Within the churches a disposition has always prevailed to\nregard sickness as a visitation; something sent by God for our\ngood, either as chastisement, as warning, or as opportunity for\nexercising virtue, and, in the Catholic Church, of earning\n\"merit.”  “Illness,” says a good Catholic writer P. Lejeune: \n(Introd. a la Vie Mystique, 1899, p. 218), “is the most excellent\ncorporeal mortifications, the mortification which one has not\none’s self chosen, which is imposed directly by God, and is the\ndirect expression of his will.  ’If other mortifications are of\nsilver,’  Mgr. Gay says, ’this one is of gold; since although it\ncomes of ourselves, coming as it does of original sin, still on\nits greater side, as coming (like all that happens) from the\nprovidence of God, it is of divine manufacture.  And how just are\nits blows!  And how efficacious it is! . . . I do not hesitate to\nsay that patience in a long illness is mortification’s very\nmasterpiece, and consequently the triumph of mortified souls.’\"\nAccording to this view, disease should in any case be\nsubmissively accepted, and it might under certain circumstances\neven be blasphemous to wish it away.",
        "Of course there have been exceptions to this, and cures by\nspecial miracle have at all times been recognized within the\nchurch’s pale, almost all the great saints having more or less\nperformed them.  It was one of the heresies of Edward Irving, to\nmaintain them still to be possible.  An extremely pure faculty of\nhealing after confession and conversion on the patient’s part,\nand prayer on the priest’s, was quite spontaneously developed in\nthe German pastor, Joh. Christoph Blumhardt, in the early forties\nand exerted during nearly thirty years.  Blumhardt’s Life by\nZundel (5th edition, Zurich, 1887) gives in chapters ix., x.,\nxi., and xvii.  a pretty full account of his healing activity,\nwhich he invariably ascribed to direct divine interposition.\nBlumhardt was a singularly pure, simple, and non-fanatical\ncharacter, and in this part of his work followed no previous\nmodel.  In Chicago to-day we have the case of Dr. J. A. Dowie, a\nScottish Baptist preacher, whose weekly “Leaves of Healing” were\nin the year of grace 1900 in their sixth volume, and who,\nalthough he denounces the cures wrought in other sects as\n\"diabolical counterfeits” of his own exclusively “Divine\nHealing,” must on the whole be counted into the mind-cure\nmovement.  In mind-cure circles the fundamental article of faith\nis that disease should never be accepted. It is wholly of the\npit.  God wants us to be absolutely healthy, and we should not\ntolerate ourselves on any lower terms.",
        "An idea, to be suggestive, must come to the individual with the\nforce of a revelation.  The mind-cure with its gospel of\nhealthy-mindedness has come as a revelation to many whose hearts\nthe church Christianity had left hardened.  It has let loose\ntheir springs of higher life.  In what can the originality of any\nreligious movement consist, save in finding a channel, until then\nsealed up, through which those springs may be set free in some\ngroup of human beings?",
        "The force of personal faith, enthusiasm, and example, and above\nall the force of novelty, are always the prime suggestive agency\nin this kind of success.  If mind-cure should ever become\nofficial, respectable, and intrenched, these elements of\nsuggestive efficacy will be lost.  In its acuter stages every\nreligion must be a homeless Arab of the desert.  The church knows\nthis well enough, with its everlasting inner struggle of the\nacute religion of the few against the chronic religion of the\nmany, indurated into an obstructiveness worse than that which\nirreligion opposes to the movings of the Spirit.  “We may pray,\"\nsays Jonathan Edwards, “concerning all those saints that are not\nlively Christians, that they may either be enlivened, or taken\naway; if that be true that is often said by some at this day,\nthat these cold dead saints do more hurt than natural men, and\nlead more souls to hell, and that it would be well for mankind if\nthey were all dead.\"[56]",
        "[56] Edwards, from whose book on the Revival in New England I\nquote these words, dissuades from such a use of prayer, but it is\neasy to see that he enjoys making his thrust at the cold dead\nchurch members.",
        "The next condition of success is the apparent existence, in large\nnumbers, of minds who unite healthy-mindedness with readiness for\nregeneration by letting go.  Protestantism has been too\npessimistic as regards the natural man, Catholicism has been too\nlegalistic and moralistic, for either the one or the other to\nappeal in any generous way to the type of character formed of\nthis peculiar mingling of elements. However few of us here\npresent may belong to such a type, it is now evident that it\nforms a specific moral combination, well represented in the\nworld.",
        "Finally, mind-cure has made what in our protestant countries is\nan unprecedentedly great use of the subconscious life.  To their\nreasoned advice and dogmatic assertion, its founders have added\nsystematic exercise in passive relaxation, concentration, and\nmeditation, and have even invoked something like hypnotic\npractice.  I quote some passages at random:–",
        "“The value, the potency of ideals is the great practical truth on\nwhich the New Thought most strongly insists–the development\nnamely from within outward, from small to great.[57] Consequently\none’s thought should be centred on the ideal outcome, even though\nthis trust be literally like a step in the dark.[58] To attain\nthe ability thus effectively to direct the mind, the New Thought\nadvises the practice of concentration, or in other words, the\nattainment of self-control.  One is to learn to marshal the\ntendencies of the mind, so that they may be held together as a\nunit by the chosen ideal.  To this end, one should set apart\ntimes for silent meditation, by one’s self, preferably in a room\nwhere the surroundings are favorable to spiritual thought.  In\nNew Thought terms, this is called ’entering the silence.’\"[59]",

        "“The time will come when in the busy office or on the noisy\nstreet you can enter into the silence by simply drawing the\nmantle of your own thoughts about you and realizing that there\nand everywhere the Spirit of Infinite Life, Love, Wisdom, Peace,\nPower, and Plenty is guiding, keeping, protecting, leading you.\nThis is the spirit of continual prayer.[60] One of the most\nintuitive men we ever met had a desk at a city office where\nseveral other gentlemen were doing business constantly, and often\ntalking loudly.  Entirely undisturbed by the many various sounds\nabout him, this self-centred faithful man would, in any moment of\nperplexity, draw the curtains of privacy so completely about him\nthat he would be as fully inclosed in his own psychic aura, and\nthereby as effectually removed from all distractions, as though\nhe were alone in some primeval wood.  Taking his difficulty with\nhim into the mystic silence in the form of a direct question, to\nwhich he expected a certain answer, he would remain utterly\npassive until the reply came, and never once through many years’\nexperience did he find himself disappointed or misled.\"[61]",

        "Wherein, I should like to know, does this INTRINSICALLY differ\nfrom the practice of “recollection” which plays so great a part\nin Catholic discipline?  Otherwise called the practice of the\npresence of God (and so known among ourselves, as for instance in\nJeremy Taylor), it is thus defined by the eminent teacher Alvarez\nde Paz in his work on Contemplation.",
        "“It is the recollection of God, the thought of God, which in all\nplaces and circumstances makes us see him present, lets us\ncommune respectfully and lovingly with him, and fills us with\ndesire and affection for him. . . .  Would you escape from every\nill?  Never lose this recollection of God, neither in prosperity\nnor in adversity, nor on any occasion whichsoever it be. Invoke\nnot, to excuse yourself from this duty, either the difficulty or\nthe importance of your business, for you can always remember that\nGod sees you, that you are under his eye.  If a thousand times an\nhour you forget him, reanimate a thousand times the recollection.",
        "If you cannot practice this exercise continuously, at least make\nyourself as familiar with it as possible; and, like unto those\nwho in a rigorous winter draw near the fire as often as they can,\ngo as often as you can to that ardent fire which will warm your\nsoul.\"[62]",
        "[62] Quoted by Lejeune:  Introd. a la vie Mystique, 1899, p. 66.",
        "All the external associations of the Catholic discipline are of\ncourse unlike anything in mind-cure thought, but the purely\nspiritual part of the exercise is identical in both communions,\nand in both communions those who urge it write with authority,\nfor they have evidently experienced in their own persons that\nwhereof they tell.  Compare again some mind-cure utterances:–",
        "“High, healthful, pure thinking can be encouraged, promoted, and\nstrengthened.  Its current can be turned upon grand ideals until\nit forms a habit and wears a channel.  By means of such\ndiscipline the mental horizon can be flooded with the sunshine of\nbeauty, wholeness, and harmony.  To inaugurate pure and lofty\nthinking may at first seem difficult, even almost mechanical, but\nperseverance will at length render it easy, then pleasant, and\nfinally delightful.",
        "“The soul’s real world is that which it has built of its\nthoughts, mental states, and imaginations.  If we WILL, we can\nturn our backs upon the lower and sensuous plane, and lift\nourselves into the realm of the spiritual and Real, and there\ngain a residence.  The assumption of states of expectancy and\nreceptivity will attract spiritual sunshine, and it will flow in\nas naturally as air inclines to a vacuum. . . .  Whenever the\nthough; is not occupied with one’s daily duty or profession, it\nshould he sent aloft into the spiritual atmosphere.  There are\nquiet leisure moments by day, and wakeful hours at night, when\nthis wholesome and delightful exercise may be engaged in to great\nadvantage.  If one who has never made any systematic effort to\nlift and control the thought-forces will, for a single month,\nearnestly pursue the course here suggested, he will be surprised\nand delighted at the result, and nothing will induce him to go\nback to careless, aimless, and superficial thinking.  At such\nfavorable seasons the outside world, with all its current of\ndaily events, is barred out, and one goes into the silent\nsanctuary of the inner temple of soul to commune and aspire.  The\nspiritual hearing becomes delicately sensitive, so that the\n’still, small voice’ is audible, the tumultuous waves of external\nsense are hushed, and there is a great calm.  The ego gradually\nbecomes conscious that it is face to face with the Divine\nPresence; that mighty, healing, loving, Fatherly life which is\nnearer to us than we are to ourselves.  There is soul contact\nwith the Parent- Soul, and an influx of life, love, virtue,\nhealth, and happiness from the Inexhaustible Fountain.\"[63]",
        "[63] HENRY Wood:  Ideal suggestion through Mental Photography,\npp. 51, 70 (abridged).",
        "When we reach the subject of mysticism, you will undergo so deep\nan immersion into these exalted states of consciousness as to be\nwet all over, if I may so express myself; and the cold shiver of\ndoubt with which this little sprinkling may affect you will have\nlong since passed away– doubt, I mean, as to whether all such\nwriting be not mere abstract talk and rhetoric set down pour\nencourager les autres.  You will then be convinced, I trust, that\nthese states of consciousness of “union” form a perfectly\ndefinite class of experiences, of which the soul may occasionally\npartake, and which certain persons may live by in a deeper sense\nthan they live by anything else with which they have\nacquaintance.  This brings me to a general philosophical\nreflection with which I should like to pass from the subject of\nhealthy-mindedness, and close a topic which I fear is already\nonly too long drawn out.  It concerns the relation of all this\nsystematized healthy-mindedness and mind-cure religion to\nscientific method and the scientific life.",
        "In a later lecture I shall have to treat explicitly of the\nrelation of religion to science on the one hand, and to primeval\nsavage thought on the other.  There are plenty of persons\nto-day–\"scientists” or “positivists,” they are fond of calling\nthemselves–who will tell you that religious thought is a mere\nsurvival, an atavistic reversion to a type of consciousness which\nhumanity in its more enlightened examples has long since left\nbehind and out-grown.  If you ask them to explain themselves more\nfully, they will probably say that for primitive thought\neverything is conceived of under the form of personality.  The\nsavage thinks that things operate by personal forces, and for the\nsake of individual ends.  For him, even external nature obeys\nindividual needs and claims, just as if these were so many\nelementary powers.  Now science, on the other hand, these\npositivists say, has proved that personality, so far from being\nan elementary force in nature, is but a passive resultant of the\nreally elementary forces, physical, chemical, physiological, and\npsycho-physical, which are all impersonal and general in\ncharacter.  Nothing individual accomplishes anything in the\nuniverse save in so far as it obeys and exemplifies some\nuniversal law.  Should you then inquire of them by what means\nscience has thus supplanted primitive thought, and discredited\nits personal way of looking at things, they would undoubtedly say\nit has been by the strict use of the method of experimental\nverification.  Follow out science’s conceptions practically, they\nwill say, the conceptions that ignore personality altogether, and\nyou will always be corroborated.  The world is so made that all\nyour expectations will be experientially verified so long, and\nonly so long, as you keep the terms from which you infer them\nimpersonal and universal.",
        "But here we have mind-cure, with her diametrically opposite\nphilosophy, setting up an exactly identical claim.  Live as if I\nwere true, she says, and every day will practically prove you\nright.  That the controlling energies of nature are personal,\nthat your own personal thoughts are forces, that the powers of\nthe universe will directly respond to your individual appeals and\nneeds, are propositions which your whole bodily and mental\nexperience will verify.  And that experience does largely verify\nthese primeval religious ideas is proved by the fact that the\nmind-cure movement spreads as it does, not by proclamation and\nassertion simply, but by palpable experiential results.  Here, in\nthe very heyday of science’s authority, it carries on an\naggressive warfare against the scientific philosophy, and\nsucceeds by using science’s own peculiar methods and weapons. \nBelieving that a higher power will take care of us in certain\nways better than we can take care of ourselves, if we only\ngenuinely throw ourselves upon it and consent to use it, it finds\nthe belief, not only not impugned, but corroborated by its\nobservation.",
        "How conversions are thus made, and converts confirmed, is evident\nenough from the narratives which I have quoted. I will quote yet\nanother couple of shorter ones to give the matter a perfectly\nconcrete turn.  Here is one:–",
        "“One of my first experiences in applying my teaching was two\nmonths after I first saw the healer.  I fell, spraining my right\nankle, which I had done once four years before, having then had\nto use a crutch and elastic anklet for some months, and carefully\nguarding it ever since.  As soon as I was on my feet I made the\npositive suggestion (and felt it through all my being):  ’There\nis nothing but God, and all life comes from him perfectly.  I\ncannot be sprained or hurt, I will let him take care of it.’\nWell, I never had a sensation in it, and I walked two miles that\nday.”",
        "The next case not only illustrates experiment and verification,\nbut also the element of passivity and surrender of which awhile\nago I made such account.",
        "“I went into town to do some shopping one morning, and I had not\nbeen gone long before I began to feel ill.  The ill feeling\nincreased rapidly, until I had pains in all my bones, nausea and\nfaintness, headache, all the symptoms in short that precede an\nattack of influenza.  I thought that I was going to have the\ngrippe, epidemic then in Boston, or something worse.  The\nmind-cure teachings that I had been listening to all the winter \nthereupon came into my mind, and I thought that here was an\nopportunity to test myself.  On my way home I met a friend, I\nrefrained with some effort from telling her how I felt.  That was\nthe first step gained.  I went to bed immediately, and my husband\nwished to send for the doctor.  But I told him that I would\nrather wait until morning and see how I felt.  Then followed one\nof the most beautiful experiences of my life.",
        "“I cannot express it in any other way than to say that I did ’lie\ndown in the stream of life and let it flow over me.’  I gave up\nall fear of any impending disease; I was perfectly willing and\nobedient.  There was no intellectual effort, or train of thought.",
        "My dominant idea was:  ’Behold the handmaid of the Lord:  be it\nunto me even as thou wilt,’ and a perfect confidence that all\nwould be well, that all WAS well.  The creative life was flowing\ninto me every instant, and I felt myself allied with the\nInfinite, in harmony, and full of the peace that passeth\nunderstanding.  There was no place in my mind for a jarring body.\nI had no consciousness of time or space or persons; but only of\nlove and happiness and faith.",
        "“I do not know how long this state lasted, nor when I fell\nasleep; but when I woke up in the morning, I WAS WELL.”",
        "These are exceedingly trivial instances,[64] but in them, if we\nhave anything at all, we have the method of experiment and\nverification.  For the point I am driving at now, it makes no\ndifference whether you consider the patients to be deluded\nvictims of their imagination or not.  That they seemed to\nTHEMSELVES to have been cured by the experiments tried was enough\nto make them converts to the system.  And although it is evident\nthat one must be of a certain mental mould to get such results\n(for not every one can get thus cured to his own satisfaction any\nmore than every one can be cured by the first regular\npractitioner whom he calls in), yet it would surely be pedantic\nand over-scrupulous for those who CAN get their savage and\nprimitive philosophy of mental healing verified in such\nexperimental ways as this, to give them up at word of command for\nmore scientific therapeutics.",
        "What are we to think of all this?  Has science made too wide a\nclaim?",
        "[64] See Appendix to this lecture for two other cases furnished\nme by friends.",
        "I believe that the claims of the sectarian scientist are, to say\nthe least, premature.  The experiences which we have been\nstudying during this hour (and a great many other kinds of\nreligious experiences are like them) plainly show the universe to\nbe a more many-sided affair than any sect, even the scientific\nsect, allows for.  What, in the end, are all our verifications\nbut experiences that agree with more or less isolated systems of\nideas (conceptual systems) that our minds have framed?  But why\nin the name of common sense need we assume that only one such\nsystem of ideas can be true?  The obvious outcome of our total\nexperience is that the world can be handled according to many\nsystems of ideas, and is so handled by different men, and will\neach time give some characteristic kind of profit, for which he\ncares, to the handler, while at the same time some other kind of\nprofit has to be omitted or postponed.  Science gives to all of\nus telegraphy, electric lighting, and diagnosis, and succeeds in\npreventing and curing a certain amount of disease. Religion in\nthe shape of mind-cure gives to some of us serenity, moral poise,\nand happiness, and prevents certain forms of disease as well as\nscience does, or even better in a certain class of persons. \nEvidently, then, the science and the religion are both of them\ngenuine keys for unlocking the world’s treasure-house to him who\ncan use either of them practically.  Just as evidently neither is\nexhaustive or exclusive of the other’s simultaneous use.  And\nwhy, after all, may not the world be so complex as to consist of\nmany interpenetrating spheres of reality, which we can thus\napproach in alternation by using different conceptions and\nassuming different attitudes, just as mathematicians handle the\nsame numerical and spatial facts by geometry, by analytical \ngeometry, by algebra, by the calculus, or by quaternions, and\neach time come out right?  On this view religion and science,\neach verified in its own way from hour to hour and from life to\nlife, would be co-eternal.  Primitive thought, with its belief in\nindividualized personal forces, seems at any rate as far as ever\nfrom being driven by science from the field to-day.  Numbers of\neducated people still find it the directest experimental channel\nby which to carry on their intercourse with reality.[65]",
        "[65] Whether the various spheres or systems are ever to fuse\nintegrally into one absolute conception, as most philosophers\nassume that they must, and how, if so, that conception may best\nbe reached, are questions that only the future can answer.  What\nis certain now is the fact of lines of disparate conception, each\ncorresponding to some part of the world’s truth, each verified in\nsome degree, each leaving out some part of real experience.",
        "The case of mind-cure lay so ready to my hand that I could not\nresist the temptation of using it to bring these last truths home\nto your attention, but I must content myself to-day with this\nvery brief indication.

        "CASE I.  “My own experience is this:  I had long been ill, and\none of the first results of my illness, a dozen years before, had\nbeen a diplopia which deprived me of the use of my eyes for\nreading and writing almost entirely, while a later one had been\nto shut me out from exercise of any kind under penalty of\nimmediate and great exhaustion.  I had been under the care of\ndoctors of the highest standing both in Europe and America, men\nin whose power to help me I had had great faith, with no or ill\nresult.  Then, at a time when I seemed to be rather rapidly\nlosing ground, I heard some things that gave me interest enough\nin mental healing to make me try it; I had no great hope of\ngetting any good from it–it was a CHANCE I tried, partly\nbecause my thought was interested by the new possibility it\nseemed to open, partly because it was the only chance I then\ncould see. I went to X in Boston, from whom some friends of mine\nhad got, or thought they had got, great help; the treatment was a\nsilent one; little was said, and that little carried no\nconviction to my mind, whatever influence was exerted was that of\nanother person’s thought or feeling silently projected on to my\nunconscious mind, into my nervous system as it were, as we sat\nstill together.  I believed from the start in the POSSIBILITY of\nsuch action, for I knew the power of the mind to shape, helping\nor hindering, the body’s nerve-activities, and I thought\ntelepathy probable, although unproved, but I had no belief in it\nas more than a possibility, and no strong conviction nor any\nmystic or religious faith connected with my thought of it that\nmight have brought imagination strongly into play.",
        "“I sat quietly with the healer for half an hour each day, at\nfirst with no result; then, after ten days or so, I became quite\nsuddenly and swiftly conscious of a tide of new energy rising\nwithin me, a sense of power to pass beyond old halting-places, of\npower to break the bounds that, though often tried before, had\nlong been veritable walls about my life, too high to climb.  I\nbegan to read and walk as I had not done for years, and the\nchange was sudden, marked, and unmistakable.  This tide seemed to\nmount for some weeks, three or four perhaps, when, summer having\ncome, I came away, taking the treatment up again a few months\nlater.  The lift I got proved permanent, and left me slowly\ngaining ground instead of losing, it but with this lift the\ninfluence seemed in a way to have spent itself, and, though my\nconfidence in the reality of the power had gained immensely from\nthis first experience, and should have helped me to make further\ngain in health and strength if my belief in it had been the\npotent factor there, I never after this got any result at all as\nstriking or as clearly marked as this which came when I made\ntrial of it first, with little faith and doubtful expectation. \nIt is difficult to put all the evidence in such a matter into\nwords, to gather up into a distinct statement all that one bases\none’s conclusions on, but I have always felt that I had abundant\nevidence to justify (to myself, at least) the conclusion that I\ncame to then, and since have held to, that the physical change\nwhich came at that time was, first, the result of a change\nwrought within me by a change of mental state; and secondly, that\nthat change of mental state was not, save in a very secondary\nway, brought about through the influence of an excited\nimagination, or a CONSCIOUSLY received suggestion of an hypnotic\nsort.  Lastly, I believe that this change was the result of my\nreceiving telephathically, and upon a mental stratum quite below\nthe level of immediate consciousness, a healthier and more\nenergetic attitude, receiving it from another person whose\nthought was directed upon me with the intention of impressing the\nidea of this attitude upon me.  In my case the disease was\ndistinctly what would be classed as nervous, not organic; but\nfrom such opportunities as I have had of observing, I have come\nto the conclusion that the dividing line that has been drawn is\nan arbitrary one, the nerves controlling the internal activities\nand the nutrition of the body throughout; and I believe that the\ncentral nervous system, by starting and inhibiting local centres,\ncan exercise a vast influence upon disease of any kind, if it can\nbe brought to bear.  In my judgment the question is simply how to\nbring it to bear, and I think that the uncertainty and remarkable\ndifferences in the results obtained through mental healing do but\nshow how ignorant we are as yet of the forces at work and of the\nmeans we should take to make them effective.  That these results\nare not due to chance coincidences my observation of myself and\nothers makes me sure; that the conscious mind, the imagination,\nenters into them as a factor in many cases is doubtless true, but\nin many others, and sometimes very extraordinary ones, it hardly\nseems to enter in at all.  On the whole I am inclined to think\nthat as the healing action, like the morbid one, springs from the\nplane of the normally UNconscious mind, so the strongest and most\neffective impressions are those which IT receives, in some as yet\nunknown subtle way, DIRECTLY from a healthier mind whose state,\nthrough a hidden law of sympathy, it reproduces.”",
        "CASE II.  “At the urgent request of friends, and with no faith\nand hardly any hope (possibly owing to a previous unsuccessful\nexperience with a Christian Scientist), our little daughter was\nplaced under the care of a healer, and cured of a trouble about\nwhich the physician had been very discouraging in his diagnosis.\nThis interested me, and I began studying earnestly the method and\nphilosophy of this method of healing.  Gradually an inner peace\nand tranquillity came to me in so positive a way that my manner\nchanged greatly.  My children and friends noticed the change and\ncommented upon it.  All feelings of irritability disappeared. \nEven the expression of my face changed noticeably.",
        "“I had been bigoted, aggressive, and intolerant in discussion,\nboth in public and private.  I grew broadly tolerant and\nreceptive toward the views of others.  I had been nervous and\nirritable, coming home two or three times a week with a sick\nheadache induced, as I then supposed, by dyspepsia and catarrh. \nI grew serene and gentle, and the physical troubles entirely\ndisappeared.  I had been in the habit of approaching every\nbusiness interview with an almost morbid dread.  I now meet every\none with confidence and inner calm.",

I do not mean simply the grosser, more sensual\nforms, but those subtler and generally unrecognized kinds, such\nas express themselves in sorrow, grief, regret, envy, etc. It has\nbeen in the direction of a practical, working realization of the\nimmanence of God and the Divinity of man’s true, inner self.",
        "At our last meeting, we considered the healthy-minded\ntemperament, the temperament which has a constitutional\nincapacity for prolonged suffering, and in which the tendency to\nsee things optimistically is like a water of crystallization in\nwhich the individual’s character is set.  We saw how this\ntemperament may become the basis for a peculiar type of religion,\na religion in which good, even the good of this world’s life, is\nregarded as the essential thing for a rational being to attend\nto.  This religion directs him to settle his scores with the more\nevil aspects of the universe by systematically declining to lay\nthem to heart or make much of them, by ignoring them in his\nreflective calculations, or even, on occasion, by denying\noutright that they exist.  Evil is a disease; and worry over\ndisease is itself an additional form of disease, which only adds\nto the original complaint.  Even repentance and remorse,\naffections which come in the character of ministers of good, may\nbe but sickly and relaxing impulses.  The best repentance is to\nup and act for righteousness, and forget that you ever had\nrelations with sin.",
        "Spinoza’s philosophy has this sort of healthy-mindedness woven\ninto the heart of it, and this has been one secret of its\nfascination.  He whom Reason leads, according to Spinoza, is led\naltogether by the influence over his mind of good.  Knowledge of\nevil is an “inadequate” knowledge, fit only for slavish minds. \nSo Spinoza categorically condemns repentance.  When men make\nmistakes, he says–",
        "“One might perhaps expect gnawings of conscience and repentance\nto help to bring them on the right path, and might thereupon\nconclude (as every one does conclude) that these affections are\ngood things.  Yet when we look at the matter closely, we shall\nfind that not only are they not good, but on the contrary\ndeleterious and evil passions.  For it is manifest that we can\nalways get along better by reason and love of truth than by worry\nof conscience and remorse.  Harmful are these and evil, inasmuch\nas they form a particular kind of sadness; and the disadvantages\nof sadness,” he continues, “I have already proved, and shown that\nwe should strive to keep it from our life.  Just so we should\nendeavor, since uneasiness of conscience and remorse are of this\nkind of complexion, to flee and shun these states of mind.\"[66]",

        "Within the Christian body, for which repentance of sins has from\nthe beginning been the critical religious act, healthy-mindedness\nhas always come forward with its milder interpretation. \nRepentance according to such healthy- minded Christians means\nGETTING AWAY FROM the sin, not groaning and writhing over its\ncommission.  The Catholic practice of confession and absolution\nis in one of its aspects little more than a systematic method of\nkeeping healthy- mindedness on top.  By it a man’s accounts with\nevil are periodically squared and audited, so that he may start\nthe clean page with no old debts inscribed.  Any Catholic will\ntell us how clean and fresh and free he feels after the purging\noperation.  Martin Luther by no means belonged to the\nhealthy-minded type in the radical sense in which we have\ndiscussed it, and he repudiated priestly absolution for sin. Yet\nin this matter of repentance he had some very healthy- minded\nideas, due in the main to the largeness of his conception of God.",
        "“When I was a monk,” he says “I thought that I was utterly cast\naway, if at any time I felt the lust of the flesh:  that is to\nsay, if I felt any evil motion, fleshly lust, wrath, hatred, or\nenvy against any brother.  I assayed many ways to help to quiet\nmy conscience, but It would not be; for the concupiscence and\nlust of my flesh did always return, so that I could not rest, but\nwas continually vexed with these thoughts:  This or that sin thou\nhast committed:  thou art infected with envy, with impatiency,\nand such other sins:  therefore thou art entered into this holy\norder in vain, and all thy good works are unprofitable.  But if\nthen I had rightly understood these sentences of Paul:  ’The\nflesh lusteth contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to\nthe flesh; and these two are one against another, so that ye\ncannot do the things that ye would do,’ I should not have so\nmiserably tormented myself, but should have thought and said to\nmyself, as now commonly I do, ’Martin, thou shalt not utterly be\nwithout sin, for thou hast flesh; thou shalt therefore feel the\nbattle thereof.’  I remember that Staupitz was wont to say, ’I\nhave vowed unto God above a thousand times that I would become a\nbetter man:  but I never performed that which I vowed.  Hereafter\nI will make no such vow:  for I have now learned by experience\nthat I am not able to perform it.  Unless, therefore, God be\nfavorable and merciful unto me for Christ’s sake, I shall not be\nable, with all my vows and all my good deeds, to stand before\nhim.’ This (of Staupitz’s) was not only a true, but also a godly\nand a holy desperation; and this must they all confess, both with\nmouth and heart, who will be saved.  For the godly trust not to\ntheir own righteousness.  They look unto Christ their reconciler\nwho gave his life for their sins.  Moreover, they know that the\nremnant of sin which is in their flesh is not laid to their\ncharge, but freely pardoned.  Notwithstanding, in the mean while\nthey fight in spirit against the flesh, lest they should FULFILL\nthe lusts thereof; and although they feel the flesh to rage and\nrebel, and themselves also do fall sometimes into sin through\ninfirmity, yet are they not discouraged, nor think therefore that\ntheir state and kind of life, and the works which are done\naccording to their calling, displease God; but they raise up\nthemselves by faith.\"[67]",

        "One of the heresies for which the Jesuits got that spiritual\ngenius, Molinos, the founder of Quietism, so abominably condemned\nwas his healthy-minded opinion of repentance:–",
        "“When thou fallest into a fault, in what matter soever it be do\nnot trouble nor afflict thyself for it.  For they are effects of\nour frail Nature, stained by Original Sin.  The common enemy will\nmake thee believe, as soon as thou fallest into any fault, that\nthou walkest in error, and therefore art out of God and his\nfavor, and herewith would he make thee distrust of the divine\nGrace, telling thee of thy misery, and making a giant of it; and\nputting it into thy head that every day thy soul grows worse\ninstead of better, whilst it so often repeats these failings.  O\nblessed Soul, open thine eyes; and shut the gate against these\ndiabolical suggestions, knowing thy misery, and trusting in the\nmercy divine.  Would not he be a mere fool who, running at\ntournament with others, and falling in the best of the career,\nshould lie weeping on the ground and afflicting himself with\ndiscourses upon his fall?  Man (they would tell him), lose no\ntime, get up and take the course again, for he that rises again\nquickly and continues his race is as if he had never fallen.  If\nthou seest thyself fallen once and a thousand times, thou\noughtest to make use of the remedy which I have given thee, that\nis, a loving confidence in the divine mercy.  These are the\nweapons with which thou must fight and conquer cowardice and vain\nthoughts.  This is the means thou oughtest to use–not to lose\ntime, not to disturb thyself, and reap no good.\"[68]",

        "Now in contrast with such healthy-minded views as these, if we\ntreat them as a way of deliberately minimizing evil, stands a\nradically opposite view, a way of maximizing evil, if you please\nso to call it, based on the persuasion that the evil aspects of\nour life are of its very essence, and that the world’s meaning\nmost comes home to us when we lay them most to heart.  We have\nnow to address ourselves to this <129> more morbid way of\nlooking at the situation.  But as I closed our last hour with a\ngeneral philosophical reflection on the healthy-minded way of\ntaking life, I should like at this point to make another\nphilosophical reflection upon it before turning to that heavier\ntask.  You will excuse the brief delay.",
        "If we admit that evil is an essential part of our being and the\nkey to the interpretation of our life, we load ourselves down\nwith a difficulty that has always proved burdensome in\nphilosophies of religion.  Theism, whenever it has erected itself\ninto a systematic philosophy of the universe, has shown a\nreluctance to let God be anything less than All-in-All.  In other\nwords, philosophic theism has always shown a tendency to become\npantheistic and monistic, and to consider the world as one unit\nof absolute fact; and this has been at variance with popular or\npractical theism, which latter has ever been more or less frankly\npluralistic, not to say polytheistic, and shown itself perfectly\nwell satisfied with a universe composed of many original\nprinciples, provided we be only allowed to believe that the\ndivine principle remains supreme, and that the others are\nsubordinate.  In this latter case God is not necessarily\nresponsible for the existence of evil; he would only be\nresponsible if it were not finally overcome.  But on the monistic\nor pantheistic view, evil, like everything else, must have its\nfoundation in God; and the difficulty is to see how this can\npossibly be the case if God be absolutely good.  This difficulty\nfaces us in every form of philosophy in which the world appears\nas one flawless unit of fact.  Such a unit is an INDIVIDUAL, and\nin it the worst parts must be as essential as the best, must be\nas necessary to make the individual what he is; since if any part\nwhatever in an individual were to vanish or alter, it would no\nlonger be THAT individual at all.  The philosophy of absolute\nidealism, so vigorously represented both in Scotland and America\nto-day, has to struggle with this difficulty quite as <130>\nmuch as scholastic theism struggled in its time; and although it\nwould be premature to say that there is no speculative issue\nwhatever from the puzzle, it is perfectly fair to say that there\nis no clear or easy issue, and that the only OBVIOUS escape from\nparadox here is to cut loose from the monistic assumption\naltogether, and to allow the world to have existed from its\norigin in pluralistic form, as an aggregate or collection of\nhigher and lower things and principles, rather than an absolutely\nunitary fact.  For then evil would not need to be essential; it\nmight be, and may always have been, an independent portion that\nhad no rational or absolute right to live with the rest, and\nwhich we might conceivably hope to see got rid of at last.",
        "Now the gospel of healthy-mindedness, as we have described it,\ncasts its vote distinctly for this pluralistic view. Whereas the\nmonistic philosopher finds himself more or less bound to say, as\nHegel said, that everything actual is rational, and that evil, as\nan element dialectically required, must be pinned in and kept and\nconsecrated and have a function awarded to it in the final system\nof truth, healthy-mindedness refuses to say anything of the\nsort.[69] Evil, it says, is emphatically irrational, and NOT to\nbe pinned in, or preserved, or consecrated in any final system of\ntruth.  It is a pure abomination to the Lord, an alien unreality,\na waste element, to be sloughed off and negated, and the very\nmemory of it, if possible, wiped out and forgotten.  The ideal,\nso far from being co-extensive with the whole actual, is a mere\nEXTRACT from the actual, marked by its deliverance from all\ncontact with this diseased, inferior, and excrementitious stuff.",
        "[69] I say this in spite of the monistic utterances of many\nmind-cure writers; for these utterances are really inconsistent\nwith their attitude towards disease, and can easily be shown not\nto be logically involved in the experiences of union with a\nhigher Presence with which they connect themselves.  The higher\nPresence, namely, need not be the absolute whole of things, it is\nquite sufficient for the life of religious experience to regard\nit as a part, if only it be the most ideal part.",
        "Here we have the interesting notion fairly and squarely presented\nto us, of there being elements of the universe which may make no\nrational whole in conjunction with the other elements, and which,\nfrom the point of view of any system which those other elements\nmake up, can only be considered so much irrelevance and\naccident–so much “dirt,” as it were, and matter out of place.  I\nask you now not to forget this notion; for although most\nphilosophers seem either to forget it or to disdain it too much\never to mention it, I believe that we shall have to admit it\nourselves in the end as containing an element of truth.  The\nmind-cure gospel thus once more appears to us as having dignity\nand importance.  We have seen it to be a genuine religion, and no\nmere silly appeal to imagination to cure disease; we have seen\nits method of experimental verification to be not unlike the\nmethod of all science; and now here we find mind- cure as the\nchampion of a perfectly definite conception of the metaphysical\nstructure of the world.  I hope that, in view of all this, you\nwill not regret my having pressed it upon your attention at such\nlength.",
        "Let us now say good-by for a while to all this way of thinking,\nand turn towards those persons who cannot so swiftly throw off\nthe burden of the consciousness of evil, but are congenitally\nfated to suffer from its presence.  Just as we saw that in\nhealthy-mindedness there are shallower and profounder levels,\nhappiness like that of the mere animal, and more regenerate sorts\nof happiness, so also are there different levels of the morbid\nmind, and the one is much more formidable than the other.  There\nare people for whom evil means only a mal-adjustment with THINGS,\na wrong correspondence of one’s life with the environment. Such\nevil as this is curable, in principle at least, upon the \nnatural plane, for merely by modifying either the self or the\nthings, or both at once, the two terms may be made to fit, and\nall go merry as a marriage bell again.  But there are others for\nwhom evil is no mere relation of the subject to particular outer\nthings, but something more radical and general, a wrongness or\nvice in his essential nature, which no alteration of the\nenvironment, or any superficial rearrangement of the inner self,\ncan cure, and which requires a supernatural remedy.  On the\nwhole, the Latin races have leaned more towards the former way of\nlooking upon evil, as made up of ills and sins in the plural,\nremovable in detail; while the Germanic races have tended rather\nto think of Sin in the singular, and with a capital S, as of\nsomething ineradicably ingrained in our natural subjectivity, and\nnever to be removed by any superficial piecemeal operations.[70]\nThese comparisons of races are always open to exception, but\nundoubtedly the northern tone in religion has inclined to the\nmore intimately pessimistic persuasion, and this way of feeling,\nbeing the more extreme, we shall find by far the more instructive\nfor our study.",

        "Recent psychology has found great use for the word “threshold” as\na symbolic designation for the point at which one state of mind\npasses into another.  Thus we speak of the threshold of a man’s\nconsciousness in general, to indicate the amount of noise,\npressure, or other outer stimulus which it takes to arouse his\nattention at all.  One with a high threshold will doze through an\namount of racket by which one with a low threshold would be\nimmediately waked.  Similarly, when one is sensitive to small\ndifferences in any order of sensation, we say he has a low\n\"difference- threshold\"–his mind easily steps over it into the\nconsciousness of the differences in question.  And just so we\nmight speak of a “pain-threshold,” a “fear-threshold,” a\n\"misery-threshold,” and find it quickly overpassed by the\nconsciousness of some individuals, but lying too high in others\nto be often reached by their consciousness.  The sanguine and\nhealthy-minded live habitually on the sunny side of their\nmisery-line, the depressed and melancholy live beyond it, in\ndarkness and apprehension.  There are men who seem to have\nstarted in life with a bottle or two of champagne inscribed to\ntheir credit; whilst others seem to have been born close to the\npain-threshold, which the slightest irritants fatally send them\nover.",
        "Does it not appear as if one who lived more habitually on one\nside of the pain-threshold might need a different sort of\nreligion from one who habitually lived on the other?  This\nquestion, of the relativity of different types of religion to\ndifferent types of need, arises naturally at this point, and will\nbecame a serious problem ere we have done.  But before we\nconfront it in general terms, we must address ourselves to the\nunpleasant task of hearing what the sick souls, as we may call\nthem in contrast to the healthy-minded, have to say of the\nsecrets of their prison-house, their own peculiar form of\nconsciousness.  Let us then resolutely turn our backs on the\nonce-born and their sky-blue optimistic gospel; let us not simply\ncry out, in spite of all appearances, “Hurrah for the\nUniverse!–God’s in his Heaven, all’s right with the world.”   \nLet us see rather whether pity, pain, and fear, and the sentiment\nof human helplessness may not open a profounder view and put into\nour hands a more complicated key to the meaning of the situation.",
        "To begin with, how CAN things so insecure as the successful\nexperiences of this world afford a stable anchorage?  A chain is\nno stronger than its weakest link, and life is after all a chain.",
        "In the healthiest and most prosperous existence, how many links\nof illness, danger, and disaster are always interposed? \nUnsuspectedly from the bottom of every fountain of pleasure, as\nthe old poet said, something bitter rises up:  a touch of nausea,\na falling dead of the delight, a whiff of melancholy, things that\nsound a knell, for fugitive as they may be, they bring a feeling\nof coming from a deeper region and often have an appalling\nconvincingness.  The buzz of life ceases at their touch as a\npiano-string stops sounding when the damper falls upon it.",
        "Of course the music can commence again;–and again and again–at\nintervals.  But with this the healthy-minded consciousness is\nleft with an irremediable sense of precariousness.  It is a bell\nwith a crack; it draws its breath on sufferance and by an\naccident.",
        "Even if we suppose a man so packed with healthy-mindedness as\nnever to have experienced in his own person any of these sobering\nintervals, still, if he is a reflecting being, he must generalize\nand class his own lot with that of others; and, doing so, he must\nsee that his escape is just a lucky chance and no essential\ndifference.  He might just as well have been born to an entirely\ndifferent fortune.  And then indeed the hollow security! What\nkind of a frame of things is it of which the best you can say is,\n\"Thank God, it has let me off clear this time!”  Is not its\nblessedness a fragile fiction?  Is not your joy in it a very\nvulgar glee, not much unlike the snicker of any rogue at his\nsuccess?  If indeed it were all success, even on such terms as\nthat! But take the happiest man, the one most envied by the\nworld, and in nine cases out of ten his inmost consciousness is\none of failure.  Either his ideals in the line of his\nachievements are pitched far higher than the achievements\nthemselves, or else he has secret ideals of which the world knows\nnothing, and in regard to which he inwardly knows himself to be\nfound wanting.",

But at bottom it has been nothing but pain and\nburden, and I can affirm that during the whole of my 75 years, I\nhave not had four weeks of genuine well-being.  It is but the\nperpetual rolling of a rock that must be raised up again\nforever.”",

        "Failure, then, failure! so the world stamps us at every turn.

We cast ourselves with our\nrepentance on his mercy only by an All-knower can we finally be\njudged.  So the need of a God very definitely emerges from this\nsort of experience of life.",

The dead know not anything, neither have they\nany more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.  Also\ntheir love and their hatred and their envy is now perished;\nneither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is\ndone under the Sun. . . . Truly the light is sweet, and a\npleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Sun:  but if a\nman live many years and rejoice in them all, yet let him remember\nthe days of darkness; for they shall be many.”",
        "In short, life and its negation are beaten up inextricably\ntogether.  But if the life be good, the negation of it must be\nbad.  Yet the two are equally essential facts of existence; and\nall natural happiness thus seems infected with a contradiction. \nThe breath of the sepulchre surrounds it.",
        "To a mind attentive to this state of things and rightly subject\nto the joy-destroying chill which such a contemplation engenders,\nthe only relief that healthy-mindedness can give is by saying: \n\"Stuff and nonsense, get out into the open air!” or “Cheer up,\nold fellow, you’ll be all right erelong, if you will only drop\nyour morbidness!”  But in all seriousness, can such bald animal\ntalk as that be treated as a rational answer?  To ascribe\nreligious value to mere happy-go-lucky contentment with one’s\nbrief chance at natural good is but the very consecration of\nforgetfulness and superficiality.  Our troubles lie indeed too\ndeep for THAT cure.  The fact that we CAN die, that we CAN be ill\nat all, is what perplexes us; the fact that we now for a moment\nlive and are well is irrelevant to that perplexity.  We need a\nlife not correlated with death, a health not liable to illness, a\nkind of good that will not perish, a good in fact that flies\nbeyond the Goods of nature.",
        "It all depends on how sensitive the soul may become to discords. \n\"The trouble with me is that I believe too much in common\nhappiness and goodness,” said a friend of mine whose\nconsciousness was of this sort, “and nothing can console me for\ntheir transiency.  I am appalled and disconcerted at its being\npossible.”    And so with most of us:  a little cooling down of\nanimal excitability and instinct, a little loss of animal\ntoughness, a little irritable weakness and descent of the\npain-threshold, will bring the worm at the core of all our usual\nsprings of delight into full view, and turn us into melancholy\nmetaphysicians.  The pride of life and glory of the world will\nshrivel.  It is after all but the standing quarrel of hot youth\nand hoary eld.  Old age has the last word:  the purely\nnaturalistic look at life, however enthusiastically it may begin,\nis sure to end in sadness.",
        "This sadness lies at the heart of every merely positivistic,\nagnostic, or naturalistic scheme of philosophy.  Let sanguine\nhealthy-mindedness do its best with its strange power of living\nin the moment and ignoring and forgetting, still the evil\nbackground is really there to be thought of, and the skull will\ngrin in at the banquet.  In the practical life of the individual,\nwe know how his whole gloom or glee about any present fact\ndepends on the remoter schemes and hopes with which it stands\nrelated.  Its significance and framing give it the chief part of\nits value.  Let it be known to lead nowhere, and however\nagreeable it may be in its immediacy, its glow and gilding\nvanish.  The old man, sick with an insidious internal disease,\nmay laugh and quaff his wine at first as well as ever, but he\nknows his fate now, for the doctors have revealed it; and the\nknowledge knocks the satisfaction out of all these functions. \nThey are partners of death and the worm is their brother, and\nthey turn to a mere flatness.",
        "The lustre of the present hour is always borrowed from the\nbackground of possibilities it goes with.  Let our common\nexperiences be enveloped in an eternal moral order; let our\nsuffering have an immortal significance; let Heaven smile upon\nthe earth, and deities pay their visits; let faith and hope be\nthe atmosphere which man breathes in;–and his days pass by with\nzest; they stir with prospects, they thrill with remoter values. \nPlace round them on the contrary the curdling cold and gloom and\nabsence of all permanent meaning which for pure naturalism and\nthe popular science evolutionism of our time are all that is\nvisible ultimately, and the thrill stops short, or turns rather\nto an anxious trembling.",

        "The early Greeks are continually held up to us in literary works\nas models of the healthy-minded joyousness which the religion of\nnature may engender.  There was indeed much joyousness among the\nGreeks–Homer’s flow of enthusiasm for most things that the sun\nshines upon is steady.  But even in Homer the reflective passages\nare cheerless,[73] and the moment the Greeks grew systematically\npensive and thought of ultimates, they became unmitigated\npessimists.[74] The jealousy of the gods, the nemesis that\nfollows  too much happiness, the all-encompassing death, fate’s\ndark opacity, the ultimate and unintelligible cruelty, were the\nfixed background of their imagination.  The beautiful joyousness\nof their polytheism is only a poetic modern fiction.  They knew\nno joys comparable in quality of preciousness to those which we\nshall erelong see that Ilrahmans, Buddhists, Christians,\nMohammedans, twice-born people whose religion is\nnon-naturalistic, get from their several creeds of mysticism and\nrenunciation.",

        "[74] E.g., Theognis, 425-428:  “Best of all for all things upon\nearth is it not to be born nor to behold the splendors of the\nsun; next best to traverse as soon as possible the gates of\nHades.”  See also the almost identical passage in Oedipus in\nColonus, 1225.–The Anthology is full of pessimistic utterances: \n\"Naked came I upon the earth, naked I go below the ground–why\nthen do I vainly toil when I see the end naked before me?\"–\"How\ndid I come to be? Whence am l?  Wherefore did I come?  To pass\naway.  How can I learn aught when naught I know?  Being naught I\ncame to life:  once more shall I be what I was.

        "The difference between Greek pessimism and the oriental and\nmodern variety is that the Greeks had not made the discovery that\nthe pathetic mood may be idealized, and figure as a higher form\nof sensibility.  Their spirit was still too essentially masculine\nfor pessimism to be elaborated or lengthily dwelt on in their\nclassic literature.  They would have despised a life set wholly\nin a minor key, and summoned it to keep within the proper bounds\nof lachrymosity. The discovery that the enduring emphasis, so far\nas this world goes, may be laid on its pain and failure, was\nreserved for races more complex, and (so to speak) more feminine\nthan the Hellenes had attained to being in the classic period. \nBut all the same was the outlook of those Hellenes blackly\npessimistic.",
        "Stoic insensibility and Epicurean resignation were the farthest\nadvance which the Greek mind made in that direction. The\nEpicurean said:  “Seek not to be happy, but rather to escape\nunhappiness; strong happiness is always linked with pain;\ntherefore hug the safe shore, and do not tempt the deeper\nraptures.  Avoid disappointment by expecting little, and by\naiming low; and above all do not fret.”  The Stoic said:  “The\nonly genuine good that life can yield a man is the free\npossession of his own soul; all other goods are lies.”  Each of\nthese philosophies is in its degree a philosophy of despair in\nnature’s boons.  Trustful self-abandonment to the joys that\nfreely offer has entirely departed from both Epicurean and Stoic;\nand what each proposes is a way of rescue from the resultant\ndust-and-ashes state of mind.  The Epicurean still awaits results\nfrom economy of indulgence and damping of desire.  The Stoic\nhopes for no results, and gives up natural good altogether. \nThere is dignity in both these forms of resignation.  They\nrepresent distinct stages in the sobering process which man’s\nprimitive intoxication with sense-happiness is sure to undergo. \nIn the one the hot blood has grown cool, in the other it has\nbecome quite cold; and although I have spoken of them in the past\ntense, as if they were merely historic, yet Stoicism and\nEpicureanism will probably be to all time typical attitudes,\nmarking a certain definite stage accomplished in the evolution of\nthe world-sick soul.[75] They mark the conclusion of what we call\nthe once-born period, and represent the highest flights of what\ntwice-born religion would call the purely natural man\n–Epicureanism, which can only by great courtesy be called a\nreligion, showing his refinement, and Stoicism exhibiting his\nmoral will.  They leave the world in the shape of an unreconciled\ncontradiction, and seek no higher unity.  Compared with the\ncomplex ecstasies which the supernaturally regenerated Christian\nmay enjoy, or the oriental pantheist indulge in, their receipts\nfor equanimity are expedients which seem almost crude in their\nsimplicity.",
        "[75] For instance, on the very day on which I write this page,\nthe post brings me some aphorisms from a worldly-wise old friend\nin Heidelberg which may serve as a good contemporaneous\nexpression of Epicureanism:  “By the word ’happiness’ every human\nbeing understands something different.  It is a phantom pursued\nonly by weaker minds.  The wise man is satisfied with the more\nmodest but much more definite term CONTENTMENT.  What education\nshould chiefly aim at is to save us from a discontented life. \nHealth is one favoring condition, but by no means an\nindispensable one, of contentment.  Woman’s heart and love are a\nshrewd device of Nature, a trap which she sets for the average\nman, to force him into working.  But the wise man will always\nprefer work chosen by himself.”",
        "Please observe, however, that I am not yet pretending finally to\nJUDGE any of these attitudes.  I am only describing their\nvariety.  The securest way to the rapturous sorts of happiness of\nwhich the twice-born make report has as an historic matter of\nfact been through a more radical pessimism than anything that we\nhave yet considered.  We have seen how the lustre and enchantment\nmay be rubbed off from the goods of nature.  But there is a pitch\nof unhappiness so great that the goods of nature may be entirely\nforgotten, and all sentiment of their existence vanish from the\nmental field.  For this extremity of pessimism to be reached,\nsomething more is needed than observation of life and reflection\nupon death.  The individual must in his own person become the\nprey of a pathological melancholy.  As the healthy-minded\nenthusiast succeeds in ignoring evil’s very existence, so the\nsubject of melancholy is forced in spite of himself to ignore\nthat of all good whatever:  for him it may no longer have the\nleast reality.  Such sensitiveness and susceptibility to mental\npain is a rare occurrence where the nervous constitution is\nentirely normal; one seldom finds it in a healthy subject even\nwhere he is the victim of the most atrocious cruelties of outward\nfortune.  So we note here the neurotic constitution, of which I\nsaid so much in my first lecture, making its active entrance on\nour scene, and destined to play a part in much that follows. \nSince these experiences of melancholy are in the first instance\nabsolutely private and individual, I can now help myself out with\npersonal documents.  Painful indeed they will be to listen to,\nand there is almost an indecency in handling them in public.  Yet\nthey lie right in the middle of our path; and if we are to touch\nthe psychology of religion at all seriously, we must be willing\nto forget conventionalities, and dive below the smooth and lying\nofficial conversational surface.",
        "One can distinguish many kinds of pathological depression.\nSometimes it is mere passive joylessness and dreariness.\ndiscouragement, dejection, lack of taste and zest and spring.\n<143> Professor Ribot has proposed the name anhedonia to\ndesignate this condition.",
        "“The state of anhedonia, if I may coin a new word to pair off\nwith analgesia,” he writes, “has been very little studied, but it\nexists.  A young girl was smitten with a liver disease which for\nsome time altered her constitution.  She felt no longer any\naffection for her father and mother.  She would have played with\nher doll, but it was impossible to find the least pleasure in the\nact. The same things which formerly convulsed her with laughter\nentirely failed to interest her now.  Esquirol observed the case\nof a very intelligent magistrate who was also a prey to hepatic\ndisease.  Every emotion appeared dead within him.  He manifested\nneither perversion nor violence, but complete absence of\nemotional reaction.  If he went to the theatre, which he did out\nof habit, he could find no pleasure there.  The thought of his\nhouse of his home, of his wife, and of his absent children moved\nhim as little, he said, as a theorem of Euclid.\"[76]",

        "Prolonged seasickness will in most persons produce a temporary\ncondition of anhedonia.  Every good, terrestrial or celestial, is\nimagined only to be turned from with disgust. A temporary\ncondition of this sort, connected with the religious evolution of\na singularly lofty character, both intellectual and moral, is\nwell described by the Catholic philosopher, Father Gratry, in his\nautobiographical recollections. In consequence of mental\nisolation and excessive study at the Polytechnic school, young\nGratry fell into a state of nervous exhaustion with symptoms\nwhich he thus describes:–",
        "“I had such a universal terror that I woke at night with a start,\nthinking that the Pantheon was tumbling on the Polytechnic\nschool, or that the school was in flames, or that the Seine was\npouring into the Catacombs, and that Paris was being swallowed  \nup.  And when these impressions were past, all day long without\nrespite I suffered an incurable and intolerable desolation,\nverging on despair.  I thought myself, in fact, rejected by God,\nlost, damned! I felt something like the suffering of hell. Before\nthat I had never even thought of hell.  My mind had never turned\nin that direction.  Neither discourses nor reflections had\nimpressed me in that way.  I took no account of hell.  Now, and\nall at once, I suffered in a measure what is suffered there.",
        "“But what was perhaps still more dreadful is that every idea of\nheaven was taken away from me:  I could no longer conceive of\nanything of the sort.  Heaven did not seem to me worth going to. \nIt was like a vacuum; a mythological elysium, an abode of shadows\nless real than the earth.  I could conceive no joy, no pleasure\nin inhabiting it.  Happiness, joy, light, affection, love– all\nthese words were now devoid of sense.  Without doubt I could\nstill have talked of all these things, but I had become incapable\nof feeling anything in them, of understanding anything about\nthem, of hoping anything from them, or of believing them to\nexist.  There was my great and inconsolable grief! I neither\nperceived nor conceived any longer the existence of happiness or\nperfection.  An abstract heaven over a naked rock.  Such was my\npresent abode for eternity.\"[77]",

So good-by forever, my dear parents. \nIt is nobody’s fault, but a strong desire of my own which I have\nlonged to fulfill for three or four years.  I have always had a\nhope that some day I might have an opportunity of fulfilling it,\nand now it has come. . . . It is a wonder I have put this off so\nlong, but I thought perhaps I should cheer up a bit and put all\nthought out of my head.”  To her brother she writes:  “Good-by\nforever, my own dearest brother.  By the time you get this I\nshall be gone forever.  I know, dear love, there is no\nforgiveness for what I am going to do. . . . I am tired of\nliving, so am willing to die. . . .

        "So much for melancholy in the sense of incapacity for joyous\nfeeling.  A much worse form of it is positive and active anguish,\na sort of psychical neuralgia wholly unknown to healthy life. \nSuch anguish may partake of various characters, having sometimes\nmore the quality of loathing; sometimes that of irritation and\nexasperation; or again of self-mistrust and self-despair; or of\nsuspicion, anxiety, trepidation, fear.  The patient may rebel or\nsubmit; may accuse himself, or accuse outside powers; and he may\nor he may not be tormented by the theoretical mystery of why he\nshould so have to suffer.  Most cases are mixed cases, and we\nshould not treat our classifications with too much respect.\nMoreover, it is only a relatively small proportion of cases that\nconnect themselves with the religious sphere of experience at\nall.

After all, I am afraid of God as much as of the\ndevil, so I drift along, thinking of nothing but suicide, but\nwith neither courage nor means here to execute the act.

First, you see how the entire\nconsciousness of the poor man is so choked with the feeling of\nevil that the sense of there being any good in the world is lost\nfor him altogether.  His attention excludes it, cannot admit it: \nthe sun has left his heaven.  And secondly you see how the\nquerulous temper of his misery keeps his mind from taking a\nreligious direction.  Querulousness of mind tends in fact rather\ntowards irreligion; and it has played, so far as I know, no part\nwhatever in the construction of religious systems.",
        "Religious melancholy must be cast in a more melting mood. \nTolstoy has left us, in his book called My Confession, a\nwonderful account of the attack of melancholy which led him to\nhis own religious conclusions.  The latter in some respects are\npeculiar; but the melancholy presents two characters which make\nit a typical document for our present purpose.  First it is a\nwell-marked case of anhedonia, of passive loss of appetite for\nall life’s values; and second, it shows how the altered and\nestranged aspect which the world assumed in consequence of this\nstimulated Tolstoy’s intellect to a gnawing, carking questioning\nand effort for philosophic relief.  I mean to quote Tolstoy at\nsome length; but before doing so, I will make a general remark on\neach of these two points.",
        "First on our spiritual judgments and the sense of value in\ngeneral.",
        "It is notorious that facts are compatible with opposite emotional\ncomments, since the same fact will inspire entirely different\nfeelings in different persons, and at different times in the same\nperson; and there is no rationally deducible connection between\nany outer fact and the sentiments it may happen to provoke. \nThese have their source in another sphere of existence\naltogether, in the animal and spiritual region of the subject’s\nbeing.  Conceive yourself, if possible, suddenly stripped of all\nthe emotion with which your world now inspires you, and try to\nimagine it AS IT EXISTS, purely by itself, without your favorable\nor unfavorable, hopeful or apprehensive comment.  It will be\nalmost impossible for you to realize such a condition of\nnegativity and deadness.  No one portion of the universe would\nthen have importance beyond another; and the whole collection of\nits things and series of its events would be without\nsignificance, character, expression, or perspective.  Whatever of\nvalue, interest, or meaning our respective worlds may appear\nendued with are thus pure gifts of the spectator’s mind.  The\npassion of love is the most familiar and extreme example of this\nfact.  If it comes, it comes; if it does not <148> come, no\nprocess of reasoning can force it.  Yet it transforms the value\nof the creature loved as utterly as the sunrise transforms Mont\nBlanc from a corpse-like gray to a rosy enchantment; and it sets\nthe whole world to a new tune for the lover and gives a new issue\nto his life.  So with fear, with indignation, jealousy, ambition,\nworship.  If they are there, life changes.  And whether they\nshall be there or not depends almost always upon non-logical,\noften on organic conditions.  And as the excited interest which\nthese passions put into the world is our gift to the world, just\nso are the passions themselves GIFTS–gifts to us, from sources\nsometimes low and sometimes high; but almost always nonlogical\nand beyond our control.  How can the moribund old man reason back\nto himself the romance, the mystery, the imminence of great\nthings with which our old earth tingled for him in the days when\nhe was young and well?  Gifts, either of the flesh or of the\nspirit; and the spirit bloweth where it listeth; and the world’s\nmaterials lend their surface passively to all the gifts alike, as\nthe stage-setting receives indifferently whatever alternating\ncolored lights may be shed upon it from the optical apparatus in\nthe gallery.",
        "Meanwhile the practically real world for each one of us, the\neffective world of the individual, is the compound world, the\nphysical facts and emotional values in indistinguishable\ncombination.  Withdraw or pervert either factor of this complex\nresultant, and the kind of experience we call pathological\nensues.",
        "In Tolstoy’s case the sense that life had any meaning whatever\nwas for a time wholly withdrawn.  The result was a transformation\nin the whole expression of reality.  When we come to study the\nphenomenon of conversion or religious regeneration, we shall see\nthat a not infrequent consequence of the change operated in the\nsubject is a transfiguration of the face of nature in his eyes. \nA new heaven seems to shine upon a new earth.  In melancholiacs\nthere is usually a similar change, only it is in the reverse\ndirection. The world now looks remote, strange, sinister,\nuncanny. Its color is gone, its breath is cold, there is no\nspeculation in the eyes it glares with.  “It is as if I lived in\nanother century,” says one asylum patient.–\"I see everything\nthrough a cloud,” says another, “things are not as they were, and\nI am changed.\"–\"I see,” says a third, “I touch, but the things\ndo not come near me, a thick veil alters the hue and look of\neverything.\"–\"Persons move like shadows, and sounds seem to come\nfrom a distant world.\"–\"There is no longer any past for me;\npeople appear so strange; it is as if I could not see any\nreality, as if I were in a theatre; as if people were actors, and\neverything were scenery; I can no longer find myself; I walk, but\nwhy?  Everything floats before my eyes, but leaves no\nimpression.\"–\"I weep false tears, I have unreal hands:  the\nthings I see are not real things.\"–Such are expressions that\nnaturally rise to the lips of melancholy subjects describing\ntheir changed state.[79]",
        "[79] I cull these examples from the work of G. Dumas:  La\nTristesse et la Joie, 1900.",
        "Now there are some subjects whom all this leaves a prey to the\nprofoundest astonishment.  The strangeness is wrong.  The\nunreality cannot be.  A mystery is concealed, and a metaphysical\nsolution must exist.  If the natural world is so double-faced and\nunhomelike, what world, what thing is real?  An urgent wondering\nand questioning is set up, a poring theoretic activity, and in\nthe desperate effort to get into right relations with the matter,\nthe sufferer is often led to what becomes for him a satisfying\nreligious solution.",
        "At about the age of fifty, Tolstoy relates that he began to have\nmoments of perplexity, of what he calls arrest, as if he knew not\n\"how to live,” or what to do.  It is obvious that these were\nmoments in which the excitement and interest which our functions\nnaturally bring had ceased.  Life had been enchanting, it was now\nflat sober, more than <150> sober, dead.  Things were\nmeaningless whose meaning had always been self-evident.  The\nquestions “Why?” and “What next?” began to beset him more and\nmore frequently.  At first it seemed as if such questions must be\nanswerable, and as if he could easily find the answers if he\nwould take the time; but as they ever became more urgent, he\nperceived that it was like those first discomforts of a sick man,\nto which he pays but little attention till they run into one\ncontinuous suffering, and then he realizes that what he took for\na passing disorder means the most momentous thing in the world\nfor him, means his death.",
        "These questions “Why?” “Wherefore?” “What for?” found no\nresponse.",
        "“I felt,” says Tolstoy, “that something had broken within me on\nwhich my life had always rested, that I had nothing left to hold\non to, and that morally my life had stopped.  An invincible force\nimpelled me to get rid of my existence, in one way or another. It\ncannot be said exactly that I WISHED to kill myself, for the\nforce which drew me away from life was fuller, more powerful,\nmore general than any mere desire.  It was a force like my old\naspiration to live, only it impelled me in the opposite\ndirection. It was an aspiration of my whole being to get out of\nlife.",
        "“Behold me then, a man happy and in good health, hiding the rope\nin order not to hang myself to the rafters of the room where\nevery night I went to sleep alone; behold me no longer going\nshooting, lest I should yield to the too easy temptation of\nputting an end to myself with my gun.",

I had\na good wife who loved me and whom I loved; good children and a\nlarge property which was increasing with no pains taken on my\npart.  I was more respected by my kinsfolk and acquaintance than\nI had ever been; I was loaded with praise by strangers; and\nwithout exaggeration I could believe my name already famous.\nMoreover I was neither insane nor ill.  On the contrary, I\npossessed a physical and mental strength which I have rarely met\nin persons of my age.  I could mow as well as the peasants, I\ncould work with my brain eight hours uninterruptedly and feel no\nbad effects.",

        "What is truest about it is that there is nothing even funny or\nsilly in it; it is cruel and stupid, purely and simply.",
        "“The oriental fable of the traveler surprised in the desert by a\nwild beast is very old.",
        "“Seeking to save himself from the fierce animal, the traveler\njumps into a well with no water in it; but at the bottom of this\nwell he sees a dragon waiting with open mouth to devour him. And\nthe unhappy man, not daring to go out lest he should be the prey\nof the beast, not daring to jump to the bottom lest he should be\ndevoured by the dragon, clings to the branches of a wild bush\nwhich grows out of one of the cracks of the well.  His hands\nweaken, and he feels that he must soon give way to certain fate;\nbut still he clings, and see two mice, one white, the other\nblack, evenly moving round the bush to which he hangs, and\ngnawing off its roots",
        "“The traveler sees this and knows that he must inevitably perish;\nbut while thus hanging he looks about him and finds on the leaves\nof the bush some drops of honey.  These he reaches with his\ntongue and licks them off with rapture.",
        "“Thus I hang upon the boughs of life, knowing that the inevitable\ndragon of death is waiting ready to tear me, and I cannot\ncomprehend why I am thus made a martyr.  I try to suck the honey\nwhich formerly consoled me; but the honey pleases me no longer,\nand day and night the white mouse and the black mouse gnaw the\nbranch to which I cling.  I can see but one thing:  the\ninevitable dragon and the mice–I cannot turn my gaze away from\nthem.",
        "“This is no fable, but the literal incontestable truth which\nevery one may understand.  What will be the outcome of what I do\nto-day?  Of what I shall do to-morrow?  What will be the outcome\nof all my life?  Why should I live?  Why should I do anything? \nIs there in life any purpose which the inevitable death which\nawaits me does not undo and destroy?",
        "“These questions are the simplest in the world.  From the stupid\nchild to the wisest old man, they are in the soul of every human\nbeing.  Without an answer to them, it is impossible, as I\nexperienced, for life to go on.",
        "“’But perhaps,’ I often said to myself, ’there may be something\nI have failed to notice or to comprehend.  It is not possible\nthat this condition of despair should be natural to mankind.’ And\nI sought for an explanation in all the branches of knowledge\nacquired by men.  I questioned painfully and protractedly and\nwith no idle curiosity.  I sought, not with indolence, but\nlaboriously and obstinately for days and nights together.  I\nsought like a man who is lost and seeks to save himself–and I\nfound nothing.  I became convinced, moreover, that all those who\nbefore me had sought for an answer in the sciences have also\nfound nothing.  And not only this, but that they have recognized\nthat the very thing which was leading me to despair–the\nmeaningless absurdity of life–is the only incontestable\nknowledge accessible to man.”",
        "To prove this point, Tolstoy quotes the Buddha, Solomon, and\nSchopenhauer.  And he finds only four ways in which men of his\nown class and society are accustomed to meet the situation. \nEither mere animal blindness, sucking the honey without seeing\nthe dragon or the mice–\"and from such a way,” he says, “I can\nlearn nothing, after what I now know;” or reflective\nepicureanism, snatching what it can while the day lasts–which is\nonly a more deliberate sort of stupefaction than the first; or\nmanly suicide; or seeing the mice and dragon and yet weakly and\nplaintively clinging to the bush of life.  Suicide was naturally\nthe consistent course dictated by the logical intellect.",
        "“Yet,” says Tolstoy, “whilst my intellect was working, something\nelse in me was working too, and kept me from the deed–a\nconsciousness of life, as I may call it, which was like a force\nthat obliged my mind to fix itself in another direction and draw\nme out of my situation of despair. . . . During the whole course\nof this year, when I almost unceasingly kept asking myself how to\nend the business, whether by the rope or by the bullet, during\nall that time, alongside of all those movements of my ideas and\nobservations, my heart kept languishing with another pining\nemotion.  I can call this by no other name than that of a thirst\nfor God.  This craving for God had nothing to do with the\nmovement of my ideas–in fact, it was the direct contrary of that\nmovement–but it came from my heart.  It was like a feeling of\ndread that made me seem like an orphan and isolated in the midst\nof all these things that were so foreign.  And this feeling of\ndread was mitigated by the hope of finding the assistance of some\none.\"[80]",

        "Of the process, intellectual as well as emotional, which,\nstarting from this idea of God, led to Tolstoy’s recovery, I will\nsay nothing in this lecture, reserving it for a later hour. The\nonly thing that need interest us now is the phenomenon of his\nabsolute disenchantment with ordinary life, and the fact that the\nwhole range of habitual values may, to a man as powerful and full\nof faculty as he was, come to appear so ghastly a mockery.",
        "When disillusionment has gone as far as this, there is seldom a\nrestitutio ad integrum.  One has tasted of the fruit of the tree,\nand the happiness of Eden never comes again. The happiness that\ncomes, when any does come–and often enough it fails to return in\nan acute form, though its form is sometimes very acute–is not\nthe simple, ignorance of ill, but something vastly more complex,\nincluding natural evil as one of its elements, but finding\nnatural evil no such stumbling-block and terror because it now\nsees it swallowed up in supernatural good.  The process is one of\nredemption, not of mere reversion to natural health, and the\nsufferer, when saved, is saved by what seems to him a second\nbirth, a deeper kind of conscious being than he could enjoy\nbefore.",
        "We find a somewhat different type of religious melancholy\nenshrined in literature in John Bunyan’s autobiography. Tolstoy’s\npreoccupations were largely objective, for the purpose and\nmeaning of life in general was what so troubled him; but poor\nBunyan’s troubles were over the condition of his own personal\nself.  He was a typical case of the psychopathic temperament,\nsensitive of conscience to a diseased degree, beset by doubts,\nfears and insistent ideas, and a victim of verbal automatisms,\nboth motor and sensory. These were usually texts of Scripture\nwhich, sometimes damnatory and sometimes favorable, would come in\na half- hallucinatory form as if they were voices, and fasten on\nhis mind and buffet it between them like a shuttlecock.  Added to\nthis were a fearful melancholy self-contempt and despair.",
        "“Nay, thought I, now I grow worse and worse, now I am farther\nfrom conversion than ever I was before.  If now I should have\nburned at the stake, I could not believe that Christ had love for\nme; alas, I could neither hear him, nor see him, nor feel him,\nnor savor any of his things.  Sometimes I would tell my condition\nto the people of God, which, when they heard, they would pity me,\nand would tell of the Promises.  But they had as good have told\nme that I must reach the Sun with my finger as have bidden me\nreceive or rely upon the Promise. [Yet] all this while as to the\nact of sinning, I never was more tender than now; I durst not\ntake a pin or stick, though but so big as a straw, for my\nconscience now was sore, and would smart at every touch; I\ncould not tell how to speak my words, for fear I should misplace\nthem.  Oh, how gingerly did I then go, in all I did or said! I\nfound myself as on a miry bog that shook if I did but stir; and\nwas as there left both by God and Christ, and the spirit, and all\ngood things.",
        "“But my original and inward pollution, that was my plague and my\naffliction.  By reason of that, I was more loathsome in my own\neyes than was a toad; and I thought I was so in God’s eyes too. \nSin and corruption, I said, would as naturally bubble out of my\nheart as water would bubble out of a fountain.  I could have\nchanged heart with anybody.  I thought none but the Devil himself\ncould equal me for inward wickedness and pollution of mind. \nSure, thought I, I am forsaken of God; and thus I continued a\nlong while, even for some years together.",
        "“And now I was sorry that God had made me a man.  The beasts,\nbirds, fishes, etc., I blessed their condition, for they had not\na sinful nature; they were not obnoxious to the wrath of God;\nthey were not to go to hell-fire after death.  I could therefore\nhave rejoiced, had my condition been as any of theirs.  Now I\nblessed the condition of the dog and toad, yea, gladly would I\nhave been in the condition of the dog or horse, for I knew they\nhad no soul to perish under the everlasting weight of Hell or\nSin, as mine was like to do.  Nay, and though I saw this, felt\nthis, and was broken to pieces with it, yet that which added to\nmy sorrow was, that I could not find with all my soul that I did\ndesire deliverance.  My heart was at times exceedingly hard.  If\nI would have given a thousand pounds for a tear, I could not shed\none; no, nor sometimes scarce desire to shed one.",
        "“I was both a burthen and a terror to myself; nor did I ever so\nknow, as now, what it was to be weary of my life, and yet afraid\nto die.  How gladly would I have been anything but myself!\nAnything but a man! and in any condition but my own.\"[81]",

In a\nlater lecture I will also give the end of the\nexperience of Henry Alline, a devoted evangelist who worked in\nNova Scotia a hundred years ago, and who thus vividly describes\nthe high-water mark of the religious melancholy which formed its\nbeginning.  The type was not unlike Bunyan’s.",
        "“Everything I saw seemed to be a burden to me; the earth seemed\naccursed for my sake:  all trees, plants, rocks, hills, and vales\nseemed to be dressed in mourning and groaning, under the weight\nof the curse, and everything around me seemed to be conspiring my\nruin.  My sins seemed to be laid open; so that I thought that\nevery one I saw knew them, and sometimes I was almost ready to\nacknowledge many things, which I thought they knew:  yea\nsometimes it seemed to me as if every one was pointing me out as\nthe most guilty wretch upon earth.  I had now so great a sense of\nthe vanity and emptiness of all things here below, that I knew\nthe whole world could not possibly make me happy, no, nor the\nwhole system of creation.  When I waked in the morning, the first\nthought would be, Oh, my wretched soul, what shall I do, where\nshall I go?  And when I laid down, would say, I shall be perhaps\nin hell before morning. I would many times look on the beasts\nwith envy, wishing with all my heart I was in their place, that I\nmight have no soul to lose; and when I have seen birds flying\nover my head, have often thought within myself, Oh, that I could\nfly away from my danger and distress! Oh, how happy should I be,\nif I were in their place!\"[82]",

I translate freely.",
        "“Whilst in this state of philosophic pessimism and general\ndepression of spirits about my prospects, I went one evening into\na dressing-room in the twilight to procure some article that was\nthere; when suddenly there fell upon me without any warning, just\nas if it came out of the darkness, a horrible fear of my own\nexistence.  Simultaneously there arose in my mind the image of an\nepileptic patient whom I had seen in the asylum, a black-haired\nyouth with greenish skin, entirely idiotic, who used to sit all\nday on one of the benches, or rather shelves against the wall,\nwith his knees drawn up against his chin, and the coarse gray\nundershirt, which was his only garment, drawn over them inclosing\nhis entire figure.  He sat there like a sort of sculptured\nEgyptian cat or Peruvian mummy, moving nothing but his black eyes\nand looking absolutely non-human.  This image and my fear entered\ninto a species of combination with each other THAT SHAPE AM I, I\nfelt, potentially.  Nothing that I possess can defend me against\nthat fate, if the hour for it should strike for me as it struck\nfor him.  There was such a horror of him, and such a perception\nof my own merely momentary discrepancy from him, that it was as\nif something hitherto solid within my breast gave way entirely,\nand I became a mass of quivering fear. After this the universe\nwas changed for me altogether.  I awoke morning after morning\nwith a horrible dread at the pit of my stomach, and with a sense\nof the insecurity of life that I never knew before, and that I\nhave never felt since.[83] It was like a revelation; and although\nthe immediate feelings passed away, the experience has made me\nsympathetic with the morbid feelings of others ever since.  It\ngradually faded, but for months I was unable to go out into the\ndark alone.",
        "[83] Compare Bunyan.  “There was I struck into a very great\ntrembling, insomuch that at some times I could, for days\ntogether, feel my very body, as well as my mind, to shake and\ntotter under the sense of the dreadful judgment of God, that\nshould fall on those that have sinned that most fearful and\nunpardonable sin.  I felt also such clogging and heat at my\nstomach, by reason of this my terror, that I was, especially at\nsome times, as if my breast-bone would have split asunder. . . . \nThus did I wind, and twine, and shrink, under the burden that was\nupon me; which burden also did so oppress me that I could neither\nstand, nor go, nor lie, either at rest or quiet.”",
        "“In general I dreaded to be left alone.  I remember wondering how\nother people could live, how I myself had ever lived, so\nunconscious of that pit of insecurity beneath the surface of\nlife.  My mother in particular, a very cheerful person, seemed to\nme a perfect paradox in her unconsciousness of danger, which you\nmay well believe I was very careful not to disturb by revelations\nof my own state of mind (I have always thought that this\nexperience of melancholia of mine had a religious bearing.”",
        "On asking this correspondent to explain more fully what he meant\nby these last words, the answer he wrote was this:–",
        "“I mean that the fear was so invasive and powerful that if I had\nnot clung to scripture-texts like ’The eternal God is my refuge,’\netc., ’Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden,’\netc., ’I am the resurrection and the life,’ etc., I think I\nshould have grown really insane.\"[84]",
        "[84] For another case of fear equally sudden, see Henry James: \nSociety the Redeemed Form of Man, Boston, 1879, pp. 43 ff.",
        "There is no need of more examples.  The cases we have looked at\nare enough.  One of them gives us the vanity of mortal things;\nanother the sense of sin; and the remaining one describes the\nfear of the universe;–and in one or other of these three ways it\nalways is that man’s original optimism and self-satisfaction get\nleveled with the dust.",
        "In none of these cases was there any intellectual insanity or\ndelusion about matters of fact; but were we disposed to open the\nchapter of really insane melancholia, with its <159>\nhallucinations and delusions, it would be a worse story\nstill–desperation absolute and complete, the whole universe\ncoagulating about the sufferer into a material of overwhelming\nhorror, surrounding him without opening or end.  Not the\nconception or intellectual perception of evil, but the grisly\nblood-freezing heart-palsying sensation of it close upon one, and\nno other conception or sensation able to live for a moment in its\npresence.  How irrelevantly remote seem all our usual refined\noptimisms and intellectual and moral consolations in presence of\na need of help like this!  Here is the real core of the religious\nproblem:  Help! help!  No prophet can claim to bring a final\nmessage unless he says things that will have a sound of reality\nin the ears of victims such as these.  But the deliverance must\ncome in as strong a form as the complaint, if it is to take\neffect; and that seems a reason why the coarser religions,\nrevivalistic, orgiastic, with blood and miracles and supernatural\noperations, may possibly never be displaced.  Some constitutions\nneed them too much.",
        "Arrived at this point, we can see how great an antagonism may\nnaturally arise between the healthy-minded way of viewing life\nand the way that takes all this experience of evil as something\nessential.  To this latter way, the morbid-minded way, as we\nmight call it, healthy-mindedness pure and simple seems\nunspeakably blind and shallow.  To the healthy-minded way, on the\nother hand, the way of the sick soul seems unmanly and diseased. \nWith their grubbing in rat-holes instead of living in the light;\nwith their manufacture of fears, and preoccupation with every\nunwholesome kind of misery, there is something almost obscene\nabout these children of wrath and cravers of a second birth.  If\nreligious intolerance and hanging and burning could again become\nthe order of the day, there is little doubt that, however it may\nhave been in the past, the healthy-minded would <160> at present\nshow themselves the less indulgent party of the two.",
        "In our own attitude, not yet abandoned, of impartial onlookers,\nwhat are we to say of this quarrel?  It seems to me that we are\nbound to say that morbid-mindedness ranges over the wider scale\nof experience, and that its survey is the one that overlaps.  The\nmethod of averting one’s attention from evil, and living simply\nin the light of good is splendid as long as it will work.  It\nwill work with many persons; it will work far more generally than\nmost of us are ready to suppose; and within the sphere of its\nsuccessful operation there is nothing to be said against it as a\nreligious solution. But it breaks down impotently as soon as\nmelancholy comes; and even though one be quite free from\nmelancholy one’s self, there is no doubt that healthy-mindedness\nis inadequate as a philosophical doctrine, because the evil facts\nwhich it refuses positively to account for are a genuine portion\nof reality; and they may after all be the best key to life’s\nsignificance, and possibly the only openers of our eyes to the\ndeepest levels of truth.",
        "The normal process of life contains moments as bad as any of\nthose which insane melancholy is filled with, moments in which\nradical evil gets its innings and takes its solid turn.  The\nlunatic’s visions of horror are all drawn from the material of\ndaily fact.  Our civilization is founded on the shambles, and\nevery individual existence goes out in a lonely spasm of helpless\nagony.  If you protest, my friend, wait till you arrive there\nyourself!  To believe in the carnivorous reptiles of geologic\ntimes is hard for our imagination–they seem too much like mere\nmuseum specimens.  Yet there is no tooth in any one of those\nmuseum-skulls that did not daily through long years of the\nforetime hold fast to the body struggling in despair of some\nfated living victim.  Forms of horror just as dreadful to the\nvictims, if on a smaller spatial scale, fill the world about us\nto-day.  Here on our very <161> hearths and in our gardens the\ninfernal cat plays with the panting mouse, or holds the hot bird\nfluttering in her jaws. Crocodiles and rattlesnakes and pythons\nare at this moment vessels of life as real as we are; their\nloathsome existence fills every minute of every day that drags\nits length along; and whenever they or other wild beasts clutch\ntheir living prey, the deadly horror which an agitated\nmelancholiac feels is the literally right reaction on the\nsituation.[85]",
        "[85] Example:  “It was about eleven o’clock at night . . . but I\nstrolled on still with the people. . . . Suddenly upon the left\nside of our road, a crackling was heard among the bushes; all of\nus were alarmed, and in an instant a tiger, rushing out of the\njungle, pounced upon the one of the party that was foremost, and\ncarried him off in the twinkling of an eye.  The rush of the\nanimal, and the crush of the poor victim’s bones in his mouth,\nand his last cry of distress, ’Ho hai!’ involuntarily reechoed by\nall of us, was over in three seconds; and then I know not what\nhappened till I returned to my senses, when I found myself and\ncompanions lying down on the ground as if prepared to be devoured\nby our enemy the sovereign of the forest.  I find my pen\nincapable of describing the terror of that dreadful moment.  Our\nlimbs stiffened, our power of speech ceased, and our hearts beat\nviolently, and only a whisper of the same ’Ho hai!’ was heard\nfrom us.  In this state we crept on all fours for some distance\nback, and then ran for life with the speed of an Arab horse for\nabout half an hour, and fortunately happened to come to a small\nvillage. . . . After this every one of us was attacked with\nfever, attended with shivering, in which deplorable state we\nremained till morning.\"–Autobiography of Lutullah a Mohammedan\nGentleman, Leipzig, 1857, p. 112.",
        "It may indeed be that no religious reconciliation with the\nabsolute totality of things is possible.  Some evils, indeed, are\nministerial to higher forms of good; but it may be that there are\nforms of evil so extreme as to enter into no good system\nwhatsoever, and that, in respect of such evil, dumb submission or\nneglect to notice is the only practical resource.  This question\nmust confront us on a later day.  But provisionally, and as a\nmere matter of program and method, since the evil facts are as\ngenuine parts of nature as the good ones, the philosophic\npresumption should be that they have some rational significance,\nand that systematic healthy-mindedness, failing as it does to\naccord to sorrow, pain, and death any positive and active\nattention whatever, is formally less complete than systems\nthat try at least to include these elements in their scope.",
        "The completest religions would therefore seem to be those in\nwhich the pessimistic elements are best developed.  Buddhism, of\ncourse, and Christianity are the best known to us of these.  They\nare essentially religions of deliverance:  the man must die to an\nunreal life before he can be born into the real life.  In my next\nlecture, I will try to discuss some of the psychological\nconditions of this second birth.  Fortunately from now onward we\nshall have to deal with more cheerful subjects than those which\nwe have recently been dwelling on.",
        "The last lecture was a painful one, dealing as it did with evil\nas a pervasive element of the world we live in.  At the close of\nit we were brought into full view of the contrast between the two\nways of looking at life which are characteristic respectively of\nwhat we called the healthy-minded, who need to be born only once,\nand of the sick souls, who must be twice-born in order to be\nhappy.  The result is two different conceptions of the universe\nof our experience.  In the religion of the once-born the world is\na sort of rectilinear or one-storied affair, whose accounts are\nkept in one denomination, whose parts have just the values which\nnaturally they appear to have, and of which a simple algebraic\nsum of pluses and minuses will give the total worth.  Happiness\nand religious peace consist in living on the plus side of the\naccount. In the religion of the twice-born, on the other hand,\nthe world is a double-storied mystery.  Peace cannot be reached\nby the simple addition of pluses and elimination of minuses from\nlife.  Natural good is not simply insufficient in amount and\ntransient, there lurks a falsity in its very being. Cancelled as\nit all is by death if not by earlier enemies, it gives no final\nbalance, and can never be the thing intended for our lasting\nworship. It keeps us from our real good, rather; and renunciation\nand despair of it are our first step in the direction of the\ntruth.  There are two lives, the natural and the spiritual, and\nwe must lose the one before we can participate in the other.\n \nIn their extreme forms, of pure naturalism and pure salvationism,\nthe two types are violently contrasted; though here as in most\nother current classifications, the radical extremes are somewhat\nideal abstractions, and the concrete human beings whom we\noftenest meet are intermediate varieties and mixtures. \nPractically, however, you all recognize the difference:  you\nunderstand, for example, the disdain of the methodist convert for\nthe mere sky-blue healthy-minded moralist; and you likewise enter\ninto the aversion of the latter to what seems to him the diseased\nsubjectivism of the Methodist, dying to live, as he calls it, and\nmaking of paradox and the inversion of natural appearances the\nessence of God’s truth.[86]",

        "Heterogeneous personality has been explained as the result of\ninheritance–the traits of character of incompatible and\nantagonistic ancestors are supposed to be preserved alongside of\neach other.[90] This explanation may pass for what it is\nworth–it certainly needs corroboration.  But whatever the cause\nof heterogeneous personality may be, we find the extreme examples\nof it in the psychopathic temperament, of which I spoke in my\nfirst lecture.  All writers about that temperament make the inner\nheterogeneity prominent in their descriptions.  Frequently,\nindeed, it is only this trait that leads us to ascribe that\ntemperament to a man at all.  A “degenere superieur” is simply a\nman of sensibility in many directions, who finds more difficulty\nthan is common in keeping <167> his spiritual house in order and\nrunning his furrow straight, because his feelings and impulses\nare too keen and too discrepant mutually.  In the haunting and\ninsistent ideas, in the irrational impulses, the morbid scruples,\ndreads, and inhibitions which beset the psychopathic temperament\nwhen it is thoroughly pronounced, we have exquisite examples of\nheterogeneous personality.  Bunyan had an obsession of the words,\n\"Sell Christ for this, sell him for that, sell him, sell him!\"\nwhich would run through his mind a hundred times together, until\none day out of breath with retorting, “I will not, I will not,\"\nhe impulsively said, “Let him go if he will,” and this loss of\nthe battle kept him in despair for over a year.  The lives of the\nsaints are full of such blasphemous obsessions, ascribed\ninvariably to the direct agency of Satan.  The phenomenon\nconnects itself with the life of the subconscious self,\nso-called, of which we must erelong speak more directly.",

        "Now in all of us, however constituted, but to a degree the\ngreater in proportion as we are intense and sensitive and subject\nto diversified temptations, and to the greatest possible degree\nif we are decidedly psychopathic, does the normal evolution of\ncharacter chiefly consist in the straightening out and unifying\nof the inner self.  The higher and the lower feelings, the useful\nand the erring impulses, begin by being a comparative chaos\nwithin us–they must end by forming a stable system of functions\nin right subordination.  Unhappiness is apt to characterize the\nperiod of order-making and struggle.  If the individual be of\ntender conscience and religiously quickened, the unhappiness will\ntake the form of moral remorse and compunction, of feeling\ninwardly vile and wrong, and of standing in false relations to\nthe author of one’s being and appointer of one’s spiritual fate. \nThis is the religious melancholy and “conviction of sin” that\nhave played so large a part in the history of Protestant\nChristianity.  The man’s interior is a battle-ground for what he\nfeels to be two deadly hostile selves, one actual, the other\nideal.  As Victor Hugo makes his Mahomet say:–",
        "     “Je suis le champ vil des sublimes combats:\n     Tantot l’homme d’en haut, et tantot l’homme d’en bas;\n     Et le mal dans ma bouche avec le bien alterne,\n     Comme dans le desert le sable et la citerne.”",
        "Wrong living, impotent aspirations; “What I would, that do I not;\nbut what I hate, that do I,” as Saint Paul says; self-loathing,\nself-despair; an unintelligible and intolerable burden to which\none is mysteriously the heir.",
        "Let me quote from some typical cases of discordant personality,\nwith melancholy in the form of self-condemnation and sense of\nsin.  Saint Augustine’s case is a classic example.  You all\nremember his half-pagan, half-Christian bringing up at Carthage,\nhis emigration to Rome and Milan, his adoption of Manicheism and\nsubsequent skepticism, and his restless search for truth and\npurity of life; and finally how, distracted by the struggle\nbetween the two souls in his breast and ashamed of his own\nweakness of will, when so many others whom he knew and knew of\nhad thrown off the shackles of sensuality and dedicated\nthemselves to chastity and the higher life, he heard a voice in\nthe garden say, “Sume, lege” (take and read), and opening the\nBible at random, saw the text, “not in chambering and\nwantonness,” etc., which seemed directly sent to his address, and\nlaid the inner storm to rest forever.[91] Augustine’s\npsychological genius has given an account of the trouble of\nhaving a divided self which has never been surpassed.",
        "[91] Louis Gourdon (Essai sur la Conversion de Saint Augustine,\nParis, Fischbacher, 1900) has shown by an analysis of Augustine’s\nwritings immediately after the date of his conversion (A. D. 386)\nthat the account he gives in the Confessions is premature.  The\ncrisis in the garden marked a definitive conversion from his\nformer life, but it was to the neo-platonic spiritualism and only\na halfway stage toward Christianity.  The latter he appears not\nfully and radically to have embraced until four years more had\npassed.",
        "“The new will which I began to have was not yet strong enough to\novercome that other will, strengthened by long indulgence. So\nthese two wills, one old, one new, one carnal, the other\nspiritual, contended with each other and disturbed my soul.  I\nunderstood by my own experience what I had read, ’flesh lusteth\nagainst spirit, and spirit against flesh.’ It was myself indeed\nin both the wills, yet more myself in that which I approved in\nmyself than in that which I disapproved in myself.  Yet it was\nthrough myself that habit had attained so fierce a mastery over\nme, because I had willingly come whither I willed not.  Still\nbound to earth, I refused, O God, to fight on thy side, as much\nafraid to be freed from all bonds, as I ought to have feared\nbeing trammeled by them.",
        "“Thus the thoughts by which I meditated upon thee were like the\nefforts of one who would awake, but being overpowered with\nsleepiness is soon asleep again.  Often does a man when heavy\nsleepiness is on his limbs defer to shake it off, and though not\napproving it, encourage it; even so I was sure it was better to\nsurrender to thy love than to yield to my own lusts, yet though\nthe former course convinced me, the latter pleased and held me\nbound.  There was naught in me to answer thy call ’Awake, thou\nsleeper,’ but only drawling, drowsy words, ’Presently; yes,\npresently; wait a little while.’  But the ’presently’ had no\n’present,’ and the ’little while’ grew long. . . .  For I was\nafraid thou wouldst hear me too soon, and heal me at once of my\ndisease of lust, which I wished to satiate rather than to see\nextinguished.  With what lashes of words did I not scourge my own\nsoul.  Yet it shrank back; it refused, though it had no excuse to\noffer. . . . I said within myself:  ’Come, let it be done now,’\nand as I said it, I was on the point of the resolve.  I all but\ndid it, yet I did not do it.  And I made another effort, and\nalmost succeeded, yet I did not reach it, and did not grasp it,\nhesitating to die to death, and live to life, and the evil to\nwhich I was so wonted held me more than the better life I had not\ntried.\"[92]",

        "There could be no more perfect description of the divided will,\nwhen the higher wishes lack just that last acuteness, that touch\nof explosive intensity, of dynamogenic quality (to use the slang\nof the psychologists), that enables them to burst their shell,\nand make irruption efficaciously into life and quell the lower\ntendencies forever.  In a later lecture we shall have much to say\nabout this higher excitability.",
        "I find another good description of the divided will in the\nautobiography of Henry Alline, the Nova Scotian evangelist, of\nwhose melancholy I read a brief account in my last lecture.  The\npoor youth’s sins were, as you will see, of the most harmless\norder, yet they interfered with what proved to be his truest\nvocation, so they gave him great distress.",
        "“I was now very moral in my life, but found no rest of\nconscience.  I now began to be esteemed in young company, who\nknew nothing of my mind all this while, and their esteem began to\nbe a snare to my soul, for I soon began to be fond of carnal\nmirth, though I still flattered myself that if I did not get\ndrunk, nor curse, nor swear, there would be no sin in frolicking\nand carnal mirth, and I thought God would indulge young people\nwith some (what I called simple or civil) recreation.  I still\nkept a round of duties, and would not suffer myself to run into\nany open vices, and so got along very well in time of health and\nprosperity, but when I was distressed or threatened by sickness,\ndeath, or heavy storms of thunder, my religion would not do, and\nI found there was something wanting, and would begin to repent my\ngoing so much to frolics, but when the distress was over, the\ndevil and my own wicked heart, with the solicitations of my\nassociates, and my fondness for young company, were such strong\nallurements, I would again give way, and thus I got to be very\nwild and rude, at the same time kept up my rounds of secret\nprayer and reading; but God, not willing I should destroy myself,\nstill followed me with his calls, and moved with such power upon\nmy conscience, that I could not satisfy myself with my\ndiversions, and in the midst of my mirth sometimes would have\nsuch a sense of my lost and undone condition, that I would wish\nmyself from the company, and after it was over, when I went home,\nwould make many promises that I would attend no more on these\nfrolics, and would beg forgiveness for hours and hours; but when\nI came to have the temptation again, I would give way:  no\nsooner would I hear the music and drink a glass of wine, but I\nwould find my mind elevated and soon proceed to any sort of\nmerriment or diversion, that I thought was not debauched or\nopenly vicious; but when I returned from my carnal mirth I felt\nas guilty as ever, and could sometimes not close my eyes for some\nhours after I had gone to my bed.  I was one of the most unhappy\ncreatures on earth.",
        "“Sometimes I would leave the company (often speaking to the\nfiddler to cease from playing, as if I was tired), and go out and\nwalk about crying and praying, as if my very heart would break,\nand beseeching God that he would not cut me off, nor give me up\nto hardness of heart.  Oh, what unhappy hours and nights I thus\nwore away!  When I met sometimes with merry companions, and my\nheart was ready to sink, I would labor to put on as cheerful a\ncountenance as possible, that they might not distrust anything,\nand sometimes would begin some discourse with young men or young\nwomen on purpose, or propose a merry song, lest the distress of\nmy soul would be discovered, or mistrusted, when at the same time\nI would then rather have been in a wilderness in exile, than with\nthem or any of their pleasures or enjoyments.  Thus for many\nmonths when I was in company?  I would act the hypocrite and\nfeign a merry heart but at the same time would endeavor as much\nas I could to shun their company, oh wretched and unhappy mortal\nthat I was!  Everything I did, and wherever I went, I was still\nin a storm and yet I continued to be the chief contriver and\nringleader of the frolics for many months after; though it was a\ntoil and torment to attend them; but the devil and my own wicked\nheart drove me about like a slave, telling me that I must do this\nand do that, and bear this and bear that, and turn here and turn\nthere, to keep my credit up, and retain the esteem of my\nassociates:  and all this while I continued as strict as possible\nin my duties, and left no stone unturned to pacify my conscience,\nwatching even against my thoughts, and praying continually\nwherever I went:  for I did not think there was any sin in my\nconduct, when I was among carnal company, because I did not take\nany satisfaction there, but only followed it, I thought, for\nsufficient reasons.",
        "“But still, all that I did or could do, conscience would roar\nnight and day.”",
        "Saint Augustine and Alline both emerged into the smooth waters of\ninner unity and peace, and I shall next ask you to consider more\nclosely some of the peculiarities of the process of unification,\nwhen it occurs.  It may come gradually, or it may occur abruptly;\nit may come through altered feelings, or through altered powers\nof action; or it may come through new intellectual insights, or\nthrough experiences which we shall later have to designate as\n’mystical.’  However it come, it brings a characteristic sort of\nrelief; and never such extreme relief as when it is cast into the\nreligious mould.  Happiness! happiness! religion is only one of\nthe ways in which men gain that gift.  Easily, permanently, and\nsuccessfully, it often transforms the most intolerable misery\ninto the profoundest and most enduring happiness.",
        "But to find religion is only one out of many ways of reaching\nunity; and the process of remedying inner incompleteness and\nreducing inner discord is a general psychological process, which\nmay take place with any sort of mental material, and need not\nnecessarily assume the religious form.  In judging of the\nreligious types of regeneration which we are about to study, it\nis important to recognize that they are only one species of a\ngenus that contains other types as well.  For example, the new\nbirth may be away from religion into incredulity; or it may be\nfrom moral scrupulosity into freedom and license; or it may be\nproduced by the irruption into the individual’s life of some new\nstimulus or passion, such as love, ambition, cupidity, revenge,\nor patriotic devotion.  In all these instances we have precisely\nthe same psychological form of event,–a firmness, stability, and\nequilibrium <173> succeeding a period of storm and stress and\ninconsistency.  In these non-religious cases the new man may also\nbe born either gradually or suddenly.",
        "The French philosopher Jouffroy has left an eloquent memorial of\nhis own “counter-conversion,” as the transition from orthodoxy to\ninfidelity has been well styled by Mr. Starbuck.  Jouffroy’s\ndoubts had long harassed him; but he dates his final crisis from\na certain night when his disbelief grew fixed and stable, and\nwhere the immediate result was sadness at the illusions he had\nlost.",
        "“I shall never forget that night of December,” writes Jouffroy,\n\"in which the veil that concealed from me my own incredulity was\ntorn.  I hear again my steps in that narrow naked chamber where\nlong after the hour of sleep had come I had the habit of walking\nup and down.  I see again that moon, half-veiled by clouds,\nwhich now and again illuminated the frigid window-panes.  The\nhours of the night flowed on and I did not note their passage. \nAnxiously I followed my thoughts, as from layer to layer they\ndescended towards the foundation of my consciousness, and,\nscattering one by one all the illusions which until then had\nscreened its windings from my view, made them every moment more\nclearly visible.",
        "“Vainly I clung to these last beliefs as a shipwrecked sailor\nclings to the fragments of his vessel; vainly, frightened at the\nunknown void in which I was about to float, I turned with them\ntowards my childhood, my family, my country, all that was dear\nand sacred to me:  the inflexible current of my thought was too\nstrong–parents, family, memory, beliefs, it forced me to let go\nof everything.  The investigation went on more obstinate and more\nsevere as it drew near its term, and did not stop until the end\nwas reached.  I knew then that in the depth of my mind nothing\nwas left that stood erect.",
        "“This moment was a frightful one; and when towards morning I\nthrew myself exhausted on my bed, I seemed to feel my earlier\nlife, so smiling and so full, go out like a fire, and before me\nanother life opened, sombre and unpeopled, where in future I must\nlive alone, alone with my fatal thought which had exiled me\nthither, and which I was tempted to curse.  The days which\nfollowed this discovery were the saddest of my life.\"[93]",
        "[93] Th. Jouffroy:  Nouveaux Melanges philosophiques, 2me\nedition, p. 83.  I add two other cases of counter-conversion\ndating from a certain moment.  The first is from Professor\nStarbuck’s manuscript collection, and the narrator is a woman.",
        "“Away down in the bottom of my heart, I believe I was always more\nor less skeptical about ’God;’ skepticism grew as an\nundercurrent, all through my early youth, but it was controlled\nand covered by the emotional elements in my religious growth. \nWhen I was sixteen I joined the church and was asked if I loved\nGod.  I replied ’Yes,’ as was customary and expected.  But\ninstantly with a flash something spoke within me, ’No, you do\nnot.’  I was haunted for a long time with shame and remorse for\nmy falsehood and for my wickedness in not loving God, mingled\nwith fear that there might be an avenging God who would punish me\nin some terrible way. . . . At nineteen, I had an attack of\ntonsilitis.  Before I had quite recovered, I heard told a story\nof a brute who had kicked his wife down-stairs, and then\ncontinued the operation until she became insensible.  I felt the\nhorror of the thing keenly.  Instantly this thought flashed\nthrough my mind:  ’I have no use for a God who permits such\nthings.’  This experience was followed by months of stoical\nindifference to the God of my previous life, mingled with\nfeelings of positive dislike and a somewhat proud defiance of\nhim.  I still thought there might be a God.  If so he would\nprobably damn me, but I should have to stand it.  I felt very\nlittle fear and no desire to propitiate him.  I have never had\nany personal relations with him since this painful experience.”",
        "The second case exemplifies how small an additional stimulus will\noverthrow the mind into a new state of equilibrium when the\nprocess of preparation and incubation has proceeded far enough. \nIt is like the proverbial last straw added to the camel’s burden,\nor that touch of a needle which makes the salt in a\nsupersaturated fluid suddenly begin to crystallize out.",
        "Tolstoy writes:  “S., a frank and intelligent man, told me as\nfollows how he ceased to believe:–",
        "“He was twenty-six years old when one day on a hunting\nexpedition, the time for sleep having come, he set himself to\npray according to the custom he had held from childhood.",
        "“His brother, who was hunting with him, lay upon the hay and\nlooked at him.  When S. had finished his prayer and was turning\nto sleep, the brother said, ’Do you still keep up that thing?’\nNothing more was said.  But since that day, now more than thirty\nyears ago, S.  has never prayed again; he never takes communion,\nand does not go to church.  All this, not because he became\nacquainted with convictions of his brother which he then and\nthere adopted; not because he made any new resolution in his\nsoul, but merely because the words spoken by his brother were\nlike the light push of a finger against a leaning wall already\nabout to tumble by its own weight.  These words but showed him\nthat the place wherein he supposed religion dwelt in him had long\nbeen empty, and that the sentences he uttered, the crosses and\nbows which he made during his prayer, were actions with no inner\nsense.  Having once seized their absurdity, he could no longer\nkeep them up.”    Ma Confession, p. 8.",
        "I subjoin an additional document which has come into my\npossession, and which represents in a vivid way what is probably\na very frequent sort of conversion, if the opposite of ’falling\nin love,’ falling out of love, may be so termed.  Falling in love\nalso conforms frequently to this type, a latent process of\nunconscious preparation often preceding a sudden awakening to the\nfact that the mischief is irretrievably done.  The free and easy\ntone in this narrative gives it a sincerity that speaks for\nitself.",
        "“For two years of this time I went through a very bad experience,\nwhich almost drove me mad.  I had fallen violently in love with a\ngirl who, young as she was, had a spirit of coquetry like a cat.\nAs I look back on her now, I hate her, and wonder how I could\never have fallen so low as to be worked upon to such an extent by\nher attractions.  Nevertheless, I fell into a regular fever,\ncould think of nothing else; whenever I was alone, I pictured her\nattractions, and spent most of the time when I should have been\nworking, in recalling our previous interviews, and imagining\nfuture conversations.  She was very pretty, good humored, and\njolly to the last degree, and intensely pleased with my\nadmiration.  Would give me no decided answer yes or no and the\nqueer thing about it was that whilst pursuing her for her hand, I\nsecretly knew all along that she was unfit to be a wife for me,\nand that she never would say yes.  Although for a year we took\nour meals at the same boarding-house, so that I saw her\ncontinually and familiarly, our closer relations had to be\nlargely on the sly, and this fact, together with my jealousy of\nanother one of her male admirers and my own conscience despising\nme for my uncontrollable weakness, made me so nervous and\nsleepless that I really thought I should become insane.  I\nunderstand well those young men murdering their sweethearts,\nwhich appear so often in the papers.  Nevertheless I did love her\npassionately, and in some ways she did deserve it.",
        "“The queer thing was the sudden and unexpected way in which it\nall stopped.  I was going to my work after breakfast one morning,\nthinking as usual of her and of my misery, when, just as if some\noutside power laid hold of me, I found myself turning round and\nalmost running to my room, where I immediately got out all the\nrelics of her which I possessed, including some hair, all her\nnotes and letters and ambrotypes on glass.  The former I made a\nfire of, the latter I actually crushed beneath my heel, in a sort\nof fierce joy of revenge and punishment.  I now loathed and\ndespised her altogether, and as for myself I felt as if a load of\ndisease had suddenly been removed from me.  That was the end.  I\nnever spoke to her or wrote to her again in all the subsequent\nyears, and I have never had a single moment of loving thought\ntowards one for so many months entirely filled my heart.  In\nfact, I have always rather hated her memory, though now I can see\nthat I had gone unnecessarily far in that direction.  At any\nrate, from that happy morning onward I regained possession of my\nown proper soul, and have never since fallen into any similar\ntrap.”",
        "This seems to me an unusually clear example of two different\nlevels of personality, inconsistent in their dictates, yet so\nwell balanced against each other as for a long time to fill the\nlife with discord and dissatisfaction.  At last, not gradually,\nbut in a sudden crisis, the unstable equilibrium is resolved, and\nthis happens so unexpectedly that it is as if, to use the\nwriter’s words, “some outside power laid hold.”",
        "Professor Starbuck gives an analogous case, and a converse case\nof hatred suddenly turning into love, in his Psychology of\nReligion, p. 141.  Compare the other highly curious instances\nwhich he gives on pp. 137-144, of sudden non-religious\nalterations of habit or character. He seems right in conceiving\nall such sudden changes as results of special cerebral functions\nunconsciously developing until they are ready to play a\ncontrolling part when they make irruption into the conscious\nlife.  When we treat of sudden ’conversion,’ I shall make as much\nuse as I can of this hypothesis of subconscious incubation. ",
        "<175> In John Foster’s Essay on Decision of Character, there is\nan account of a case of sudden conversion to avarice, which is\nillustrative enough to quote:–",
        "A young man, it appears, “wasted, in two or three years, a large\npatrimony in profligate revels with a number of worthless\nassociates who called themselves his friends, and who, when his\nlast means were exhausted, treated him of course with neglect or\ncontempt.  Reduced to absolute want, he one day went out of the\nhouse with an intention to put an end to his life, but wandering\nawhile almost unconsciously, he came to the brow of an eminence\nwhich overlooked what were lately his estates.  Here he sat down,\nand remained fixed in thought a number of hours, at the end of\nwhich he sprang from the ground with a vehement, exulting\nemotion.  He had formed his resolution, which was, that all these\nestates should be his again; he had formed his plan, too, which\nhe instantly began to execute.  He walked hastily forward,\ndetermined to seize the first opportunity, of however humble a\nkind, to gain any money, though it were ever so despicable a\ntrifle, and resolved absolutely not to spend, if he could help\nit, a farthing of whatever he might obtain.  The first thing that\ndrew his attention was a heap of coals shot out of carts on the\npavement before a house.  He offered himself to shovel or wheel\nthem into the place where they were to be laid, and was employed.",
        "He received a few pence for the labor; and then, in pursuance of\nthe saving part of his plan requested some small gratuity of meat\nand drink, which was given <176> him.  He then looked out for\nthe next thing that might chance; and went, with indefatigable\nindustry, through a succession of servile employments in\ndifferent places, of longer and shorter duration, still\nscrupulous in avoiding, as far as possible, the expense of a\npenny.  He promptly seized every opportunity which could advance\nhis design, without regarding the meanness of occupation or\nappearance.  By this method he had gained, after a considerable\ntime, money enough to purchase in order to sell again a few\ncattle, of which he had taken pains to understand the value.  He\nspeedily but cautiously turned his first gains into second\nadvantages; retained without a single deviation his extreme\nparsimony; and thus advanced by degrees into larger transactions\nand incipient wealth.  I did not hear, or have forgotten, the\ncontinued course of his life, but the final result was, that he\nmore than recovered his lost possessions, and died an inveterate\nmiser, worth L60,000.\"[94]",

I have felt\nthe freedom now for so long a time that I am sure of my relation\ntoward it; and I could no more harbor any of the thieving and\ndepressing influences that once I nursed as a heritage of\nhumanity than a fop would voluntarily wallow in a filthy gutter.",
        "“There is no doubt in my mind that pure Christianity and pure\nBuddhism, and the Mental Sciences and all Religions fundamentally\nteach what has been a discovery to me; but none of them have\npresented it in the light of a simple and easy process of\nelimination.  At one time I wondered if the elimination would not\nyield to indifference and sloth.  In my experience, the contrary\nis the result.  I feel such an increased desire to do something\nuseful that it seems as if I were a boy again and the energy for\nplay had returned.  I could fight as readily as (and better than)\never, if there were occasion for it.  It does not make one a\ncoward.  It can’t, since fear is one of the things eliminated.  I\nnotice the absence of timidity in the presence of any audience. \nWhen a boy, I was standing under a tree which was struck by\nlightning, and received a shock from the effects of which I never\nknew exemption until I had dissolved partnership with worry. \nSince then, lightning and thunder have been encountered under\nconditions which would formerly have caused great depression and\ndiscomfort, without [my] experiencing a trace of either. \nSurprise is also greatly modified, and one is less liable to\nbecome startled by unexpected sights or noises.",
        "“As far as I am individually concerned, I am not bothering myself\nat present as to what the results of this emancipated condition\nmay be.  I have no doubt that the perfect health aimed at by\nChristian Science may be one of the possibilities, for I note a\nmarked improvement in the way my stomach does its duty in\nassimilating the food I give it to handle, and I am sure it works\nbetter to the sound of a song than under the friction of a frown.\nNeither am I wasting any of this precious time formulating an\nidea of a future existence or a future Heaven.  The Heaven that I\nhave within myself is as attractive as any that has been promised\nor that I can imagine; and I am willing to let the growth lead\nwhere it will, as long as the anger and their brood have no part\nin misguiding it.\"[95]",

        "The older medicine used to speak of two ways, lysis and crisis,\none gradual, the other abrupt, in which one might recover from a\nbodily disease.  In the spiritual realm there are also two ways,\none gradual, the other sudden, in which inner unification may\noccur.  Tolstoy and Bunyan may again serve us as examples,\nexamples, as it happens, of the gradual way, though it must be\nconfessed at the outset that it is hard to follow these windings\nof the hearts of others, and one feels that their words do not\nreveal their total secret.",
        "Howe’er this be, Tolstoy, pursuing his unending questioning,\n<181> seemed to come to one insight after another.  First he\nperceived that his conviction that life was meaningless took only\nthis finite life into account.  He was looking for the value of\none finite term in that of another, and the whole result could\nonly be one of those indeterminate equations in mathematics which\nend with infinity.  Yet this is as far as the reasoning intellect\nby itself can go, unless irrational sentiment or faith brings in\nthe infinite.  Believe in the infinite as common people do, and\nlife grows possible again.",
        "“Since mankind has existed, wherever life has been, there also\nhas been the faith that gave the possibility of living.  Faith is\nthe sense of life, that sense by virtue of which man does not\ndestroy himself, but continues to live on.  It is the force\nwhereby we live. If Man did not believe that he must live for\nsomething, he would not live at all.  The idea of an infinite\nGod, of the divinity of the soul, of the union of men’s actions\nwith God–these are ideas elaborated in the infinite secret\ndepths of human thought.  They are ideas without which there\nwould be no life, without which I myself,” said Tolstoy, “would\nnot exist.  I began to see that I had no right to rely on my\nindividual reasoning and neglect these answers given by faith,\nfor they are the only answers to the question.”",
        "Yet how believe as the common people believe, steeped as they are\nin grossest superstition?  It is impossible–but yet their life!\ntheir life! It is normal.  It is happy!  It is an answer to the\nquestion!",
        "Little by little, Tolstoy came to the settled conviction–he says\nit took him two years to arrive there–that his trouble had not\nbeen with life in general, not with the common life of common\nmen, but with the life of the upper, intellectual, artistic\nclasses, the life which he had personally always led, the\ncerebral life, the life of conventionality, artificiality, and\npersonal ambition.  He had been living wrongly and must change. \nTo work for animal needs, to abjure lies and vanities, to relieve\ncommon wants, to be simple, to believe in God, therein lay\nhappiness again.",
        "“I remember,” he says, “one day in early spring, I was alone in\nthe forest, lending my ear to its mysterious noises.  I listened,\nand my thought went back to what for these three years it always\nwas busy with–the quest of God.  But the idea of him, I said,\nhow did I ever come by the idea?",
        "“And again there arose in me, with this thought, glad aspirations\ntowards life.  Everything in me awoke and received a meaning.  . \n. .Why do I look farther?  a voice within me asked.  He is there:",
        "he, without whom one cannot live.  To acknowledge God and to live\nare one and the same thing.  God is what life is.  Well, then!\nlive, seek God, and there will be no life without him. . . .",
        "“After this, things cleared up within me and about me better than\never, and the light has never wholly died away.  I was saved from\nsuicide.  Just how or when the change took place I cannot tell. \nBut as insensibly and gradually as the force of life had been\nannulled within me, and I had reached my moral death-bed, just as\ngradually and imperceptibly did the energy of life come back. \nAnd what was strange was that this energy that came back was\nnothing new.  It was my ancient juvenile force of faith, the\nbelief that the sole purpose of my life was to be BETTER.   I\ngave up the life of the conventional world, recognizing it to be\nno life, but a parody on life, which its superfluities simply\nkeep us from comprehending,\"–and Tolstoy thereupon embraced the\nlife of the peasants, and has felt right and happy, or at least\nrelatively so, ever since.[96]",
        "[96] I have considerably abridged Tolstoy’s words in my\ntranslation.",
        "As I interpret his melancholy, then, it was not merely an\naccidental vitiation of his humors, though it was doubtless also\nthat.  It was logically called for by the clash between his inner\ncharacter and his outer activities and aims.  Although a literary\nartist, Tolstoy was one of those primitive oaks of men to whom\nthe superfluities and insincerities, the cupidities,\ncomplications, and cruelties of our polite civilization are\nprofoundly unsatisfying, and for whom the eternal veracities lie\nwith more natural and animal things.  His crisis was the getting\nof his soul in order, the discovery of its genuine habitat and\nvocation, the escape from falsehoods into what for him were ways\nof truth.  It was a case of heterogeneous personality tardily and\nslowly finding its unity and level. And though not many of us can\nimitate Tolstoy, not having enough, perhaps, of the aboriginal\nhuman marrow in our bones, most of us may at least feel as if it\nmight be better for us if we could.",
        "Bunyan’s recovery seems to have been even slower.  For years\ntogether he was alternately haunted with texts of Scripture, now\nup and now down, but at last with an ever growing relief in his\nsalvation through the blood of Christ.",
        "“My peace would be in and out twenty times a day; comfort now and\ntrouble presently; peace now and before I could go a furlong as\nfull of guilt and fear as ever heart could hold.”  When a good\ntext comes home to him, “This,” he writes, “gave me good\nencouragement for the space of two or three hours\"; or “This was\na good day to me, I hope I shall not forget it”, or “The glory of\nthese words was then so weighty on me that I was ready to swoon\nas I sat; yet, not with grief and trouble, but with solid joy and\npeace\"; or “This made a strange seizure on my spirit; it brought\nlight with it, and commanded a silence in my heart of all those\ntumultuous thoughts that before did use, like masterless\nhell-hounds, to roar and bellow and make a hideous noise within\nme.  It showed me that Jesus Christ had not quite forsaken and\ncast off my Soul.”",
        "Such periods accumulate until he can write:  “And now remained\nonly the hinder part of the tempest, for the thunder was gone\nbeyond me, only some drops would still remain, that now and then\nwould fall upon me\";–and at last:  “Now did my chains fall off\nmy legs indeed; I was loosed from my afflictions and irons; my\ntemptations also fled away; so that from that time, those\ndreadful Scriptures of God left off to trouble me; now went I\nalso home rejoicing, for the grace and love of God. . . . Now\ncould I see myself in Heaven and Earth at once; in Heaven by my\nChrist, by my Head, by my Righteousness and Life, though on\nEarth by my body or person. . . .  Christ was a precious Christ\nto my soul that night; I could scarce lie in my bed for joy and\npeace and triumph through Christ.”",
        "Bunyan became a minister of the gospel, and in spite of his\nneurotic constitution, and of the twelve years he lay in prison\nfor his non-conformity, his life was turned to active use.  He\nwas a peacemaker and doer of good, and the immortal Allegory\nwhich he wrote has brought the very spirit of religious patience\nhome to English hearts.",
        "But neither Bunyan nor Tolstoy could become what we have called\nhealthy-minded.  They had drunk too deeply of the cup of\nbitterness ever to forget its taste, and their redemption is into\na universe two stories deep.  Each of them realized a good which\nbroke the effective edge of his sadness; yet the sadness was\npreserved as a minor ingredient in the heart of the faith by\nwhich it was overcome.  The fact of interest for us is that as a\nmatter of fact they could and did find SOMETHING welling up in\nthe inner reaches of their consciousness, by which such extreme\nsadness could be overcome.  Tolstoy does well to talk of it as\nTHAT BY WHICH MEN LIVE; for that is exactly what it is, a\nstimulus, an excitement, a faith, a force that re-infuses the\npositive willingness to live, even in full presence of the evil\nperceptions that erewhile made life seem unbearable.  For\nTolstoy’s perceptions of evil appear within their sphere to have\nremained unmodified.  His later works show him implacable to the\nwhole system of official values:  the ignobility of fashionable\nlife; the infamies of empire; the spuriousness of the church, the\nvain conceit of the professions; the meannesses and cruelties\nthat go with great success; and every other pompous crime and\nlying institution of this world.  To all patience with such\nthings his experience has been for him a perroanent ministry of\ndeath.",
        "Bunyan also leaves this world to the enemy.",
        "“I must first pass a sentence of death,” he says, “upon\neverything that can properly be called a thing of this life, even\nto reckon myself, my wife, my children, my health, my enjoyments,\nand all, as dead to me, and myself as dead to them; to trust in\nGod through Christ, as touching the world to come, and as\ntouching this world, to count the grave my house, to make my bed\nin darkness, and to say to corruption, Thou art my father and to\nthe worm, Thou art my mother and sister. . . .  The parting with\nmy wife and my poor children hath often been to me as the pulling\nof my flesh from my bones, especially my poor blind child who lay\nnearer my heart than all I had besides.  Poor child, thought I,\nwhat sorrow art thou like to have for thy portion in this world!\nThou must be beaten, must beg, suffer hunger, cold, nakedness,\nand a thousand calamities, though I cannot now endure that the\nwind should blow upon thee.  But yet I must venture you all with\nGod, though it goeth to the quick to leave you.\"[97]",

        "These examples may suffice to acquaint us in a general way with\nthe phenomenon technically called “Conversion.”  In the next\nlecture I shall invite you to study its peculiarities and\nconcomitants in some detail.",
        "To be converted, to be regenerated, to receive grace, to\nexperience religion, to gain an assurance, are so many phrases\nwhich denote the process, gradual or sudden, by which a self\nhitherto divided, and consciously wrong inferior and unhappy,\nbecomes unified and consciously right superior and happy, in\nconsequence of its firmer hold upon religious realities.  This at\nleast is what conversion signifies in general terms, whether or\nnot we believe that a direct divine operation is needed to bring\nsuch a moral change about.",
        "Before entering upon a minuter study of the process, let me\nenliven our understanding of the definition by a concrete\nexample.  I choose the quaint case of an unlettered man, Stephen\nH. Bradley, whose experience is related in a scarce American\npamphlet.[98]",
        "[98] A sketch of the life of Stephen H. Bradley, from the age of\nfive to twenty four years, including his remarkable experience of\nthe power of the Holy Spirit on the second evening of November,\n1829. Madison, Connecticut, 1830.",
        "I select this case because it shows how in these inner\nalterations one may find one unsuspected depth below another, as\nif the possibilities of character lay disposed in a series of\nlayers or shells, of whose existence we have no premonitory\nknowledge.",
        "Bradley thought that he had been already fully converted at the\nage of fourteen.",
        "“I thought I saw the Saviour, by faith, in human shape, for about\none second in the room, with arms extended, appearing to say to\nme, Come.  The next day I rejoiced with trembling; soon after, my\nhappiness was so great that I said that I wanted to die; this\nworld had no place in my affections, as I knew of, and every day\nappeared as solemn to me as the Sabbath.  I had an ardent desire\nthat all mankind might feel as I did; I wanted to have them all\nlove God supremely.  Previous to this time I was very selfish and\nself-righteous; but now I desired the welfare of all mankind, and\ncould with a feeling heart forgive my worst enemies, and I felt\nas if I should be willing to bear the scoffs and sneers of any\nperson, and suffer anything for His sake, if I could be the means\nin the hands of God, of the conversion of one soul.”",
        "Nine years later, in 1829, Mr. Bradley heard of a revival of\nreligion that had begun in his neighborhood.  “Many of the young\nconverts,” he says, “would come to me when in meeting and ask me\nif I had religion, and my reply generally was, I hope I have. \nThis did not appear to satisfy them; they said they KNEW THEY had\nit.  I requested them to pray for me, thinking with myself, that\nif I had not got religion now, after so long a time professing to\nbe a Christian, that it was time I had, and hoped their prayers\nwould be answered in my behalf.",
        "“One Sabbath, I went to hear the Methodist at the Academy. He\nspoke of the ushering in of the day of general judgment; and he\nset it forth in such a solemn and terrible manner as I never\nheard before.  The scene of that day appeared to be taking place,\nand so awakened were all the powers of my mind that, like Felix,\nI trembled involuntarily on the bench where I was sitting, though\nI felt nothing at heart.  The next day evening I went to hear him\nagain.  He took his text from Revelation:  ’And I saw the dead,\nsmall and great, stand before God.’  And he represented the\nterrors of that day in such a manner that it appeared as if it\nwould melt the heart of stone.  When he finished his discourse,\nan old gentleman turned to me and said ’This is what I call\npreaching.’  I thought the same, but my feelings were still\nunmoved by what he said, and I did not enjoy religion, but I\nbelieve he did.",
        "“I will now relate my experience of the power of the Holy Spirit\nwhich took place on the same night.  Had any person told \nme previous to this that I could have experienced the power of\nthe Holy Spirit in the manner which I did, I could not have\nbelieved it, and should have thought the person deluded that told\nme so.  I went directly home after the meeting, and when I got\nhome I wondered what made me feel so stupid.  I retired to rest\nsoon after I got home, and felt indifferent to the things of\nreligion until I began to be exercised by the Holy Spirit, which\nbegan in about five minutes after, in the following manner:–",
        "“At first, I began to feel my heart beat very quick all on a\nsudden, which made me at first think that perhaps something is\ngoing to ail me, though I was not alarmed, for I felt no pain. \nMy heart increased in its beating, which soon convinced me that\nit was the Holy Spirit from the effect it had on me.  I began to\nfeel exceedingly happy and humble, and such a sense of\nunworthiness as I never felt before.  I could not very well help\nspeaking out, which I did, and said, Lord, I do not deserve this\nhappiness, or words to that effect, while there was a stream\n(resembling air in feeling) came into my mouth and heart in a\nmore sensible manner than that of drinking anything, which\ncontinued, as near as I could judge, five minutes or more, which\nappeared to be the cause of such a palpitation of my heart.  It\ntook complete possession of my soul, and I am certain that I\ndesired the Lord, while in the midst of it, not to give me any\nmore happiness, for it seemed as if I could not contain what I\nhad got.  My heart seemed as if it would burst, but it did not\nstop until I felt as if I was unutterably full of the love and\ngrace of God.  In the mean time while thus exercised, a thought\narose in my mind, what can it mean?  and all at once, as if to\nanswer it, my memory became exceedingly clear, and it appeared to\nme just as if the New Testament was placed open before me, eighth\nchapter of Romans, and as light as if some candle lighted was\nheld for me to read the 26th and 27th verses of that chapter, and\nI read these words:  ’The Spirit helpeth our infirmities with\ngroanings which cannot be uttered.’  And all the time that my\nheart was a-beating, it made me groan like a person in distress,\nwhich was not very easy to stop, though I was in no pain at all,\nand my brother being in bed in another room came and opened the\ndoor, and asked me if I had got the toothache.  I told him no, \nand that he might get to sleep. I tried to stop.  I felt\nunwilling to go to sleep myself, I was so happy, fearing I should\nlose it– thinking within myself",
        "          ’My willing soul would stay\n           In such a frame as this.’",
        "And while I lay reflecting, after my heart stopped beating,\nfeeling as if my soul was full of the Holy Spirit, I thought that\nperhaps there might be angels hovering round my bed.  I felt just\nas if I wanted to converse with them, and finally I spoke, saying\n’O ye affectionate angels! how is it that ye can take so much\ninterest in our welfare, and we take so little interest in our\nown.’  After this, with difficulty I got to sleep; and when I\nawoke in the morning my first thoughts were:  What has become of\nmy happiness?  and, feeling a degree of it in my heart, I asked\nfor more, which was given to me as quick as thought.  I then got\nup to dress myself, and found to my surprise that I could but\njust stand.  It appeared to me as if it was a little heaven upon\nearth.  My soul felt as completely raised above the fears of\ndeath as of going to sleep; and like a bird in a cage, I had a\ndesire, if it was the will of God, to get released from my body\nand to dwell with Christ, though willing to live to do good to\nothers, and to warn sinners to repent.  I went downstairs feeling\nas solemn as if I had lost all my friends, and thinking with\nmyself, that I would not let my parents know it until I had first\nlooked into the Testament.  I went directly to the shelf and\nlooked into it, at the eighth of Romans, and every verse seemed\nto almost speak and to confirm it to be truly the Word of God,\nand as if my feelings corresponded with the meaning of the word. \nI then told my parents of it, and told them that I thought that\nthey must see that when I spoke, that it was not my own voice,\nfor it appeared so to me.  My speech seemed entirely under the\ncontrol of the Spirit within me; I do not mean that the words\nwhich I spoke were not my own, for they were.  I thought that I\nwas influenced similar to the Apostles on the day of Pentecost\n(with the exception of having power to give it to others, and\ndoing what they did).  After breakfast I went round to converse\nwith my neighbors on religion, which I could not have been \nhired to have done before this, and at their request I prayed\nwith them, though I had never prayed in public before.",
        "“I now feel as if I had discharged my duty by telling the truth,\nand hope by the blessing of God, it may do some good to all who\nshall read it.  He has fulfilled his promise in sending the Holy\nSpirit down into our hearts, or mine at least, and I now defy all\nthe Deists and Atheists in the world to shake my faith in\nChrist.”",
        "So much for Mr. Bradley and his conversion, of the effect of\nwhich upon his later life we gain no information.  Now for a\nminuter survey of the constituent elements of the conversion\nprocess.",
        "If you open the chapter on Association, of any treatise on\nPsychology, you will read that a man’s ideas, aims, and objects\nform diverse internal groups and systems, relatively independent\nof one another.  Each ’aim’ which he follows awakens a certain\nspecific kind of interested excitement, and gathers a certain\ngroup of ideas together in subordination to it as its associates;\nand if the aims and excitements are distinct in kind, their\ngroups of ideas may have little in common.  When one group is\npresent and engrosses the interest, all the ideas connected with\nother groups may be excluded from the mental field.  The\nPresident of the United States when, with paddle, gun, and\nfishing-rod, he goes camping in the wilderness for a vacation,\nchanges his system of ideas from top to bottom.  The presidential\nanxieties have lapsed into the background entirely; the official\nhabits are replaced by the habits of a son of nature, and those\nwho knew the man only as the strenuous magistrate would not “know\nhim for the same person” if they saw him as the camper.",
        "If now he should never go back, and never again suffer political\ninterests to gain dominion over him, he would be for practical\nintents and purposes a permanently transformed being.  Our\nordinary alterations of character, as we pass from one of our\naims to another, are not commonly called transformations, because\neach of them is so rapidly succeeded by another in the reverse\ndirection; but whenever one aim grows so stable as to expel\ndefinitively its previous rivals from the individual’s life, we\ntend to speak of the phenomenon, and perhaps to wonder at it, as\na “transformation.”",
        "These alternations are the completest of the ways in which a self\nmay be divided.  A less complete way is the simultaneous\ncoexistence of two or more different groups of aims, of which one\npractically holds the right of way and instigates activity,\nwhilst the others are only pious wishes, and never practically\ncome to anything.  Saint Augustine’s aspirations to a purer life,\nin our last lecture, were for a while an example.  Another would\nbe the President in his full pride of office, wondering whether\nit were not all vanity, and whether the life of a wood-chopper\nwere not the wholesomer destiny.  Such fleeting aspirations are\nmere velleitates, whimsies.  They exist on the remoter outskirts\nof the mind, and the real self of the man, the centre of his\nenergies, is occupied with an entirely different system.  As life\ngoes on, there is a constant change of our interests, and a\nconsequent change of place in our systems of ideas, from more\ncentral to more peripheral, and from more peripheral to more\ncentral parts of consciousness.  I remember, for instance, that\none evening when I was a youth, my father read aloud from a\nBoston newspaper that part of Lord Gifford’s will which founded\nthese four lectureships.  At that time I did not think of being a\nteacher of philosophy, and what I listened to was as remote from\nmy own life as if it related to the planet Mars.  Yet here I am,\nwith the Gifford system part and parcel of my very self, and all\nmy energies, for the time being, devoted to successfully\nidentifying myself with it.  My soul stands now planted in what\nonce was for it a practically unreal object, and speaks from it\nas from its proper habitat and centre.",
        "When I say “Soul,” you need not take me in the ontological sense\nunless you prefer to; for although ontological language is\ninstinctive in such matters, yet Buddhists or Humians can\nperfectly well describe the facts in the phenomenal terms which\nare their favorites.  For them the soul is only a succession of\nfields of consciousness:  yet there is found in each field a\npart, or sub-field, which figures as focal and contains the\nexcitement, and from which, as from a centre, the aim seems to be\ntaken.  Talking of this part, we involuntarily apply words of\nperspective to distinguish it from the rest, words like “here,\"\n\"this,” “now,” “mine,” or “me\"; and we ascribe to the other parts\nthe positions “there,” “then,” “that,” “his” or “thine,” “it,\"\n\"not me.”  But a “here” can change to a “there,” and a “there\"\nbecome a “here,” and what was “mine” and what was “not mine\"\nchange their places.",
        "What brings such changes about is the way in which emotional\nexcitement alters.  Things hot and vital to us to-day are cold\nto-morrow.  It is as if seen from the hot parts of the field that\nthe other parts appear to us, and from these hot parts personal\ndesire and volition make their sallies.  They are in short the\ncentres of our dynamic energy, whereas the cold parts leave us\nindifferent and passive in proportion to their coldness.",
        "Whether such language be rigorously exact is for the present of\nno importance.  It is exact enough, if you recognize from your\nown experience the facts which I seek to designate by it.",
        "Now there may be great oscillation in the emotional interest, and\nthe hot places may shift before one almost as rapidly as the\nsparks that run through burnt-up paper.  Then we have the\nwavering and divided self we heard so much of in the previous\nlecture.  Or the focus of excitement and heat, the point of view\nfrom which the aim is taken, may come to lie permanently within a\ncertain system; and then, if the change be a religious one, we\ncall it a CONVERSION, especially if it be by crisis, or sudden.",
        "Let us hereafter, in speaking of the hot place in a man’s\nconsciousness, the group of ideas to which he devotes himself,\nand from which he works, call it THE HABITUAL CENTRE OF HIS\nPERSONAL ENERGY.  It makes a great difference to a man whether\none set of his ideas, or another, be the centre of his energy;\nand it makes a great difference, as regards any set of ideas\nwhich he may possess, whether they become central or remain\nperipheral in him.  To say that a man is “converted” means, in\nthese terms, that religious ideas, previously peripheral in his\nconsciousness, now take a central place, and that religious aims\nform the habitual centre of his energy.",
        "Now if you ask of psychology just HOW the excitement shifts in a\nman’s mental system, and WHY aims that were peripheral become at\na certain moment central, psychology has to reply that although\nshe can give a general description of what happens, she is unable\nin a given case to account accurately for all the single forces\nat work.  Neither an outside observer nor the Subject who\nundergoes the process can explain fully how particular\nexperiences are able to change one’s centre of energy so\ndecisively, or why they so often have to bide their hour to do\nso.  We have a thought, or we perform an act, repeatedly, but on\na certain day the real meaning of the thought peals through us\nfor the first time, or the act has suddenly turned into a moral\nimpossibility.  All we know is that there are dead feelings, dead\nideas, and cold beliefs, and there are hot and live ones; and\nwhen one grows hot and alive within us, everything has to\nre-crystallize about it.  We may say that the heat and liveliness\nmean only the “motor efficacy,” long deferred but now operative,\nof the idea; but such talk itself is only circumlocution, for\nwhence the sudden motor efficacy?  And our explanations then get\nso vague and general that one realizes all the more the intense\nindividuality of the whole phenomenon.",
        "In the end we fall back on the hackneyed symbolism of a\nmechanical equilibrium.  A mind is a system of ideas, each with\nthe excitement it arouses, and with tendencies impulsive and\ninhibitive, which mutually check or reinforce one another.  The\ncollection of ideas alters by subtraction or by addition in the\ncourse of experience, and the tendencies alter as the organism\ngets more aged.  A mental system may be undermined or weakened by\nthis interstitial alteration just as a building is, and yet for a\ntime keep upright by dead habit.  But a new perception, a sudden\nemotional shock, or an occasion which lays bare the organic\nalteration, will make the whole fabric fall together; and then\nthe centre of gravity sinks into an attitude more stable, for the\nnew ideas that reach the centre in the rearrangement seem now to\nbe locked there, and the new structure remains permanent.",
        "Formed associations of ideas and habits are usually factors of\nretardation in such changes of equilibrium.  New information,\nhowever acquired, plays an accelerating part in the changes; and\nthe slow mutation of our instincts and propensities, under the\n\"unimaginable touch of time” has an enormous influence. \nMoreover, all these influences may work subconsciously or half\nunconsciously.[99] And when you get a Subject in whom the\nsubconscious life–of which I must speak more fully soon–is\nlargely developed, and in whom motives habitually ripen in\nsilence, you get a case of which you can never give a full\naccount, and in which, both to the Subject and the onlookers,\nthere may appear an element of marvel.  Emotional occasions,\nespecially violent ones, are extremely potent in precipitating\nmental rearrangements.  The sudden and explosive ways in which\nlove, jealousy, guilt, fear, remorse, or anger can seize upon one\nare known to everybody.[100]  Hope, happiness, security, resolve,\nemotions characteristic of conversion, can be equally explosive. \nAnd emotions that come in this explosive way seldom leave things\nas they found them.",
        "[99] Jouffroy is an example:  “Down this slope it was that my\nintelligence had glided, and little by little it had got far from\nits first faith.  But this melancholy revolution had not taken\nplace in the broad daylight of my consciousness; too many\nscruples, too many guides and sacred affections had made it\ndreadful to me, so that I was far from avowing to myself the\nprogress it had made.  It had gone on in silence, by an\ninvoluntary elaboration of which I was not the accomplice; and\nalthough I had in reality long ceased to be a Christian, yet, in\nthe innocence of my intention, I should have shuddered to suspect\nit, and thought it calumny had I been accused of such a falling\naway.”  Then follows Jouffroy’s account of his\ncounter-conversion, quoted above on p. 173.",
        "[100] One hardly needs examples; but for love, see p. 176, note,\nfor fear, p. 161 ; for remorse, see Othello after the murder;\nfor anger see Lear after Cordelia’s first speech to him; for\nresolve, see p. 175 (J. Foster case).  Here is a pathological\ncase in which GUILT was the feeling that suddenly exploded:  “One\nnight I was seized on entering bed with a rigor, such as\nSwedenborg describes as coming over him with a sense of holiness,\nbut over me with a sense of GUILT. During that whole night I lay\nunder the influence of the rigor, and from its inception I felt\nthat I was under the curse of God.  I have never done one act of\nduty in my life–sins against God and man beginning as far as my\nmemory goes back–a wildcat in human shape.”",
        "In his recent work on the Psychology of Religion, Professor\nStarbuck of California has shown by a statistical inquiry how\nclosely parallel in its manifestations the ordinary “conversion\"\nwhich occurs in young people brought up in evangelical circles is\nto that growth into a larger spiritual life which is a normal\nphase of adolescence in every class of human beings.  The age is\nthe same, falling usually between fourteen and seventeen.  The\nsymptoms are the same,–sense of incompleteness and imperfection;\nbrooding, depression, morbid introspection, and sense of sin;\nanxiety about the hereafter; distress over doubts, and the like. \nAnd the result is the same–a happy relief and objectivity, as\nthe confidence in self gets greater through the adjustment of the\nfaculties to the wider outlook.  In spontaneous religious\nawakening, apart from revivalistic examples, and in the ordinary\nstorm and stress and moulting-time of adolescence, we also may\nmeet with mystical experiences, astonishing the subjects by their\nsuddenness, just as in revivalistic conversion.  The analogy, in\nfact, is complete; and Starbuck’s conclusion as to these ordinary\nyouthful conversions would seem to be the only sound one: \nConversion is in its essence a normal adolescent phenomenon,\nincidental to the passage from the child’s small universe to the\nwider intellectual and spiritual life of maturity.",
        "“Theology,” says Dr. Starbuck, “takes the adolescent tendencies\nand builds upon them; it sees that the essential thing in\nadolescent growth is bringing the person out of childhood into\nthe new life of maturity and personal insight.  It accordingly\nbrings those means to bear which will intensify the normal\ntendencies.  It shortens up the period of duration of storm and\nstress.”  The conversion phenomena of “conviction of sin” last,\nby this investigator’s statistics, about one fifth as long as the\nperiods of adolescent storm and stress phenomena of which he also\ngot statistics, but they are very much more intense.  Bodily\naccompaniments, loss of sleep and appetite, for example, are much\nmore frequent in them.  “The essential distinction appears to be\nthat conversion intensifies but shortens the period by bringing\nthe person to a definite crisis.\"[101]",
        "[101] E. D. Starbuck:  The Psychology of Religion, pp. 224, 262.",
        "The conversions which Dr. Starbuck here has in mind are of course\nmainly those of very commonplace persons, kept true to a\npre-appointed type by instruction, appeal, and example. The\nparticular form which they affect is the result of suggestion and\nimitation.[102] If they went through their growth-crisis in other\nfaiths and other countries, although the essence of the change\nwould be the same (since it is one in the main so inevitable),\nits accidents would be different. In Catholic lands, for example,\nand in our own Episcopalian sects, no such anxiety and conviction\nof sin is usual as in sects that encourage revivals.  The\nsacraments being more relied on in these more strictly\necclesiastical bodies, the individual’s personal acceptance of\nsalvation needs less to be accentuated and led up to.",
        "[102] No one understands this better than Jonathan Edwards\nunderstood it already.  Conversion narratives of the more\ncommonplace sort must always be taken with the allowances which\nhe suggests:",
        "“A rule received and established by common consent has a very\ngreat, though to many persons an insensible influence in forming\ntheir notions of the process of their own experience.  I know\nvery well how they proceed as to this matter, for I have had\nfrequent opportunities of observing their conduct.  Very often\ntheir experience at first appears like a confused chaos, but then\nthose parts are selected which bear the nearest resemblance to\nsuch particular steps as are insisted on; and these are dwelt\nupon in their thoughts, and spoken of from time to time, till\nthey grow more and more conspicuous in their view, and other\nparts which are neglected grow more and more obscure.  Thus what\nthey have experienced is insensibly strained, so as to bring it\nto an exact conformity to the scheme already established in their\nminds.  And it becomes natural also for ministers, who have to\ndeal with those who insist upon distinctness and clearness of\nmethod, to do so too.”  Treatise on Religious Affections.",
        "But every imitative phenomenon must once have had its original,\nand I propose that for the future we keep as close as may be to\nthe more first-hand and original forms of experience.  These are\nmore likely to be found in sporadic adult cases.",
        "Professor Leuba, in a valuable article on the psychology of\nconversion,[103] subordinates the theological aspect of the\nreligious life almost entirely to its moral aspect.  The\nreligious sense he defines as “the feeling of unwholeness, of\nmoral imperfection, of sin, to use the technical word,\naccompanied by the yearning after the peace of unity.”  “The word\n’religion,’” he says, “is getting more and more to signify the\nconglomerate of desires and emotions springing from the sense of\nsin and its release\"; and he gives a large number of examples, in\nwhich the sin ranges from drunkenness to spiritual pride, to show\nthat the sense of it may beset one and crave relief as urgently\nas does the anguish of the sickened flesh or any form of physical\nmisery.",

        "Undoubtedly this conception covers an immense number of cases.  A\ngood one to use as an example is that of Mr. S. H. Hadley, who\nafter his conversion became an active and useful rescuer of\ndrunkards in New York.  His experience runs as follows:–",
        "“One Tuesday evening I sat in a saloon in Harlem, a homeless,\nfriendless, dying drunkard.  I had pawned or sold everything that\nwould bring a drink.  I could not sleep unless I was dead drunk. \nI had not eaten for days, and for four nights preceding I had\nsuffered with delirium tremens, or the horrors, from midnight\ntill morning.  I had often said, ’I will never be a tramp.  I\nwill never be cornered, for when that time comes, if ever it\ncomes, I will find a home in the bottom of the river.’  But the\nLord so ordered it that when that time did come I was not able to\nwalk one quarter of the way to the river.  As I sat there\nthinking, I seemed to feel some great and mighty presence.  I did\nnot know then what it was.  I did learn afterwards that it was\nJesus, the sinner’s friend.  I walked up to the bar and pounded\nit with my fist till I made the glasses rattle.  Those who stood\nby drinking looked on with scornful curiosity.  I said I would\nnever take another drink, if I died on the street, and really I\nfelt as though that would happen before morning.  Something said,\n’If you want to keep this promise, go and have yourself locked\nup.’  I went to the nearest station-house and had myself locked\nup.",
        "“I was placed in a narrow cell, and it seemed as though all the\ndemons that could find room came in that place with me.  This was\nnot all the company I had, either.  No, praise the Lord:  that\ndear Spirit that came to me in the saloon was present, and\nsaid, Pray.  I did pray, and though I did not feel any great\nhelp, I kept on praying.  As soon as I was able to leave my cell\nI was taken to the police court and remanded back to the cell.  I\nwas finally released, and found my way to my brother’s house,\nwhere every care was given me.  While lying in bed the\nadmonishing Spirit never left me, and when I arose the following\nSabbath morning I felt that day would decide my fate, and toward\nevening it came into my head to go to Jerry M’Auley’s Mission.  I\nwent.  The house was packed, and with great difficulty I made my\nway to the space near the platform.  There I saw the apostle to\nthe drunkard and the outcast–that man of God, Jerry M’Auley.  He\nrose, and amid deep silence told his experience.  There was a\nsincerity about this man that carried conviction with it, and I\nfound myself saying, ’I wonder if God can save me?’  I listened\nto the testimony of twenty-five or thirty persons, every one of\nwhom had been saved from rum, and I made up my mind that I would\nbe saved or die right there.  When the invitation was given, I\nknelt down with a crowd of drunkards.  Jerry made the first\nprayer.  Then Mrs. M’Auley prayed fervently for us.  Oh, what a\nconflict was going on for my poor soul!  A blessed whisper said,\n’Come’; the devil said, ’Be careful.’  I halted but a moment, and\nthen, with a breaking heart, I said, ’Dear Jesus, can you help\nme?’  Never with mortal tongue can I describe that moment. \nAlthough up to that moment my soul had been filled with\nindescribable gloom, I felt the glorious brightness of the\nnoonday sun shine into my heart.  I felt I was a free man.  Oh,\nthe precious feeling of safety, of freedom, of resting on Jesus!\nI felt that Christ with all his brightness and power had come\ninto my life; that, indeed, old things had passed away and all\nthings had become new.",
        "“From that moment till now I have never wanted a drink of\nwhiskey, and I have never seen money enough to make me take one. \nI promised God that night that if he would take away the appetite\nfor strong drink, I would work for him all my life.  He has done\nhis part, and I have been trying to do mine.\"[104]",
        "[104] I have abridged Mr. Hadley’s account.  For other\nconversions of drunkards, see his pamphlet, Rescue Mission Work,\npublished at the Old Jerry M’Auley Water Street Mission, New York\nCity.  A striking collection of cases also appears in the\nappendix to Professor Leuba’s article.",
        "<200> Dr. Leuba rightly remarks that there is little doctrinal\ntheology in such an experience, which starts with the absolute\nneed of a higher helper, and ends with the sense that he has\nhelped us.  He gives other cases of drunkards’ conversions which\nare purely ethical, containing, as recorded, no theological\nbeliefs whatever.  John B. Gough’s case, for instance, is\npractically, says Dr. Leuba, the conversion of an\natheist–neither God nor Jesus being mentioned.[105] But in spite\nof the importance of this type of regeneration, with little or no\nintellectual readjustment, this writer surely makes it too\nexclusive.  It corresponds to the subjectively centered form of\nmorbid melancholy, of which Bunyan and Alline were examples.  But\nwe saw in our seventh lecture that there are objective forms of\nmelancholy also, in which the lack of rational meaning of the\nuniverse, and of life anyhow, is the burden that weighs upon\none–you remember Tolstoy’s case.[106] So there are distinct\nelements in conversion, and their relations to individual lives\ndeserve to be discriminated.[107]",
        "[105] A restaurant waiter served provisionally as Gough’s\n’Saviour.’  General Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army,\nconsiders that the first vital step in saving outcasts consists\nin making them feel that some decent human being cares enough for\nthem to take an interest in the question whether they are to rise\nor sink.",
        "[106] The crisis of apathetic melancholy–no use in life–into\nwhich J. S. Mill records that he fell, from which he emerged by\nthe reading of Marmontel’s Memoirs (Heaven save the mark!) and\nWordsworth’s poetry, is another intellectual and general\nmetaphysical case. See Mill’s Autobiography, New York, 1873, pp.\n141, 148.",
        "[107] Starbuck, in addition to “escape from sin,” discriminates\n\"spiritual illumination” as a distinct type of conversion\nexperience. Psychology of Religion, p. 85.",
        "Some persons, for instance, never are, and possibly never under\nany circumstances could be, converted.  Religious ideas cannot\nbecome the centre of their spiritual energy.  They may be\nexcellent persons, servants of God in practical ways, but they\nare not children of his kingdom.  They are either incapable of\nimagining the invisible; or else, in the language of devotion,\nthey are life-long subjects of “barrenness” and “dryness.”   \nSuch inaptitude for religious faith may in some cases be\nintellectual in its origin.  Their religious faculties may be\nchecked in their natural tendency to expand, by beliefs about the\nworld that are inhibitive, the pessimistic and materialistic\nbeliefs, for example, within which so many good souls, who in\nformer times would have freely indulged their religious\npropensities, find themselves nowadays, as it were, frozen; or\nthe agnostic vetoes upon faith as something weak and shameful,\nunder which so many of us today lie cowering, afraid to use our\ninstincts.  In many persons such inhibitions are never overcome. \nTo the end of their days they refuse to believe, their personal\nenergy never gets to its religious centre, and the latter remains\ninactive in perpetuity.",
        "In other persons the trouble is profounder.  There are men\nanaesthetic on the religious side, deficient in that category of\nsensibility.  Just as a bloodless organism can never, in spite of\nall its goodwill, attain to the reckless “animal spirits” enjoyed\nby those of sanguine temperament; so the nature which is\nspiritually barren may admire and envy faith in others, but can\nnever compass the enthusiasm and peace which those who are\ntemperamentally qualified for faith enjoy.  All this may,\nhowever, turn out eventually to have been a matter of temporary\ninhibition.  Even late in life some thaw, some release may take\nplace, some bolt be shot back in the barrenest breast, and the\nman’s hard heart may soften and break into religious feeling. \nSuch cases more than any others suggest the idea that sudden\nconversion is by miracle.  So long as they exist, we must not\nimagine ourselves to deal with irretrievably fixed classes. \nNow there are two forms of mental occurrence in human beings,\nwhich lead to a striking difference in the conversion process, a\ndifference to which Professor Starbuck has called attention.  You\nknow how it is when you try to recollect a forgotten name. \nUsually you help the recall by working for it, by mentally\nrunning over the places, persons, and things with which the word\nwas connected.  But sometimes this effort fails:  you feel then\nas if the harder you tried the less hope there would be, as\nthough the name were JAMMED, and pressure in its direction only\nkept it all the more from rising. And then the opposite expedient\noften succeeds.  Give up the effort entirely; think of something\naltogether different, and in half an hour the lost name comes\nsauntering into your mind, as Emerson says, as carelessly as if\nit had never been invited.  Some hidden process was started in\nyou by the effort, which went on after the effort ceased, and\nmade the result come as if it came spontaneously.  A certain\nmusic teacher, says Dr. Starbuck, says to her pupils after the\nthing to be done has been clearly pointed out, and unsuccessfully\nattempted:  “Stop trying and it will do itself!\"[108]",
        "[108] Psychology of Religion, p. 117.",
        "There is thus a conscious and voluntary way and an involuntary\nand unconscious way in which mental results may get accomplished;\nand we find both ways exemplified in the history of conversion,\ngiving us two types, which Starbuck calls the volitional type and\nthe type by self-surrender respectively.",
        "In the volitional type the regenerative change is usually\ngradual, and consists in the building up, piece by piece, of a\nnew set of moral and spiritual habits.  But there are always\ncritical points here at which the movement forward seems much\nmore rapid.  This psychological fact is abundantly illustrated by\nDr. Starbuck.  Our education in any practical accomplishment\nproceeds apparently by jerks and starts just as the growth of our\nphysical bodies does.",
        "“An athlete . . . sometimes awakens suddenly to an understanding\nof the fine points of the game and to a real enjoyment of it,\njust as the convert awakens to an appreciation of religion. If he\nkeeps on engaging in the sport, there may come a day when all at\nonce the game plays itself through him–when he loses himself in\nsome great contest.  In the same way, a musician may suddenly\nreach a point at which pleasure in the technique of the art\nentirely falls away, and in some moment of inspiration he becomes\nthe instrument through which music flows. The writer has chanced\nto hear two different married persons, both of whose wedded lives\nhad been beautiful from the beginning, relate that not until a\nyear or more after marriage did they awake to the full\nblessedness of married life.  So it is with the religious\nexperience of these persons we are studying.\"[109]",
        "[109] Psychology of Religion, p. 385.  Compare, also, pp. 137-144\nand 262.",
        "We shall erelong hear still more remarkable illustrations of\nsubconsciously maturing processes eventuating in results of which\nwe suddenly grow conscious.  Sir William Hamilton and Professor\nLaycock of Edinburgh were among the first to call attention to\nthis class of effects; but Dr. Carpenter first, unless I am\nmistaken, introduced the term “unconscious cerebration,” which\nhas since then been a popular phrase of explanation.  The facts\nare now known to us far more extensively than he could know them,\nand the adjective “unconscious,” being for many of them almost\ncertainly a misnomer, is better replaced by the vaguer term\n\"subconscious” or “subliminal.”",
        "Of the volitional type of conversion it would be easy to give\nexamples,[110] but they are as a rule less interesting than \nthose of the self-surrender type, in which the subconscious\neffects are more abundant and often startling.  I will therefore\nhurry to the latter, the more so because the difference between\nthe two types is after all not radical.  Even in the most\nvoluntarily built-up sort of regeneration there are passages of\npartial self-surrender interposed; and in the great majority of\nall cases, when the will had done its uttermost towards bringing\none close to the complete unification aspired after, it seems\nthat the very last step must be left to other forces and\nperformed without the help of its activity.  In other words,\nself-surrender becomes then indispensable.  “The personal will,\"\nsays Dr. Starbuck, “must be given up.  In many cases relief\npersistently refuses to come until the person ceases to resist,\nor to make an effort in the direction he desires to go.”",
        "[110] For instance, C. G. Finney italicizes the volitional\nelement:  “Just at this point the whole question of Gospel\nsalvation opened to my mind in a manner most marvelous to me at\nthe time.  I think I then saw, as clearly as I ever have in my\nlife, the reality and fullness of the atonement of Christ. \nGospel salvation seemed to me to be an offer of something to be\naccepted, and all that was necessary on my part to get my own\nconsent to give up my sins and accept Christ.  After this\ndistinct revelation had stood for some little time before my\nmind, the question seemed to be put, ’will you accept it now,\nto-day?’ I replied, ’Yes; I will accept it to-day, or I will die\nin the attempt!’”  He then went into the woods, where he\ndescribes his struggles.  He could not pray, his heart was\nhardened in its pride.  “I then reproached myself for having\npromised to give my heart to God before I left the woods.  When I\ncame to try, I found I could not. . . .  My inward soul hung\nback, and there was no going out of my heart to God.  The thought\nwas pressing me, of the rashness of my promise that I would give\nmy heart to God that day, or die in the attempt.  It seemed to me\nas if that was binding on my soul; and yet I was going to break\nmy vow.  A great sinking and discouragement came over me, and I\nfelt almost too weak to stand upon my knees.  Just at this moment\nI again thought I heard some one approach me, and I opened my\neyes to see whether it were so.  But right there the revelation\nof my pride of heart, as the great difficulty that stood in the\nway, was distinctly shown to me.  An overwhelming sense of my\nwickedness in being ashamed to have a human being see me on my\nknees before God took such powerful possession of me, that I\ncried at the top of my voice, and exclaimed that I would not\nleave that place if all the men on earth and all the devils in\nhell surrounded me.  ’What!’ I said, ’such a degraded sinner as I\nam, on my knees confessing my sins to the great and holy God; and\nashamed to have any human being, and a sinner like myself, find\nme on my knees endeavoring to make my peace with my offended\nGod!’  The sin appeared awful, infinite.  It broke me down before\nthe Lord.”  Memoirs, pp. 14-16, abridged.",
        "“I had said I would not give up; but when my will was broken, it\nwas all over,” writes one of Starbuck’s correspondents.– Another\nsays:  “I simply said:  ’Lord, I have done all I can; I leave the\nwhole matter with Thee,’ and immediately there came to me a great\npeace.\"–Another:  “All at once it occurred to me that I might be\nsaved, too, if I would stop trying to do it all myself, and\nfollow Jesus:  somehow I lost my load.\"–Another:  “I finally\nceased to resist, and gave myself up, though it was a hard\nstruggle.  Gradually the feeling came over me that I had done my\npart, and God was willing to do his.\"[111]–\"Lord Thy will be\ndone; damn or save!” cries John Nelson,[112] exhausted with the\nanxious struggle to escape damnation; and at that moment his soul\nwas filled with peace.",

        "Dr. Starbuck gives an interesting, and it seems to me a true,\naccount–so far as conceptions so schematic can claim truth at\nall–of the reasons why self-surrender at the last moment should\nbe so indispensable.  To begin with, there are two things in the\nmind of the candidate for conversion:  first, the present\nincompleteness or wrongness, the “sin” which he is eager to\nescape from; and, second, the positive ideal which he longs to\ncompass.  Now with most of us the sense of our present wrongness\nis a far more distinct piece of our consciousness than is the\nimagination of any positive ideal we can aim at.  In a majority\nof cases, indeed, the “sin” almost exclusively engrosses the\nattention, so that conversion is “a process of struggling away\nfrom sin rather than of striving towards righteousness.\"[113] A\nman’s conscious wit and will, so far as they strain towards the\nideal, are aiming at something only dimly and inaccurately\nimagined. Yet all the while the forces of mere organic ripening\nwithin him are going on towards their own prefigured result, and\nhis conscious strainings are letting loose subconscious allies\nbehind the scenes, which in their way work towards rearrangement;\nand the rearrangement towards which all these deeper forces tend\nis pretty surely definite, and definitely different from what he\nconsciously conceives and determines.  It may consequently be\nactually interfered with (JAMMED, as it were, like the lost word\nwhen we seek too energetically to recall it), by his voluntary\nefforts slanting from the true direction.",
        "[113] Starbuck, p. 64.",
        "Starbuck seems to put his finger on the root of the matter when\nhe says that to exercise the personal will is still to live in\nthe region where the imperfect self is the thing most emphasized.\nWhere, on the contrary, the subconscious forces take the lead, it\nis more probably the better self in posse which directs the\noperation.  Instead of being clumsily and vaguely aimed at from\nwithout, it is then itself the organizing centre.  What then must\nthe person do?  “He must relax,” says Dr. Starbuck–\"that is, he\nmust fall back on the larger Power that makes for righteousness,\nwhich has been welling up in his own being, and let it finish in\nits own way the work it has begun. . . .  The act of yielding, in\nthis point of view, is giving one’s self over to the new life,\nmaking it the centre of a new personality, and living, from\nwithin, the truth of it which had before been viewed\nobjectively.\"[114]",
        "[114] Starbuck, p. 115.",
        "“Man’s extremity is God’s opportunity” is the theological way of\nputting this fact of the need of self-surrender; whilst the\nphysiological way of stating it would be, “Let one do all in\none’s power, and one’s nervous system will do the rest.”  Both\nstatements acknowledge the same fact.[115]",
        "[115] Starbuck, p. 113.",
        "To state it in terms of our own symbolism:  When the new centre\nof personal energy has been subconsciously incubated so long as\nto be just ready to open into flower, “hands off” is the only\nword for us, it must burst forth unaided!",
        "We have used the vague and abstract language of psychology. But\nsince, in any terms, the crisis described is the throwing of our\nconscious selves upon the mercy of powers which, whatever they\nmay be, are more ideal than we are actually, and make for our\nredemption, you see why self-surrender has been and always must\nbe regarded as the vital turning-point of the religious life, so\nfar as the religious life is spiritual and no affair of outer\nworks and ritual and sacraments.  One may say that the whole\ndevelopment of Christianity in inwardness has consisted in little\nmore than the greater and greater emphasis attached to this\ncrisis of self-surrender.  From Catholicism to Lutheranism, and\nthen to Calvinism; from that to Wesleyanism; and from this,\noutside of technical Christianity altogether, to pure\n\"liberalism” or transcendental idealism, whether or not of the\nmind-cure type, taking in the mediaeval mystics, the quietists,\nthe pietists, and quakers by the way, we can trace the stages of\nprogress towards the idea of an immediate spiritual help,\nexperienced by the individual in his forlornness and standing in\nno essential need of doctrinal apparatus or propitiatory\nmachinery.",
        "Psychology and religion are thus in perfect harmony up to this\npoint, since both admit that there are forces seemingly outside\nof the conscious individual that bring redemption to his life. \nNevertheless psychology, defining these forces as “subconscious,\"\nand speaking of their effects, as due to “incubation,” or\n\"cerebration,” implies that they do not transcend the\nindividual’s personality; and herein she diverges from Christian\ntheology, which insists that they are direct supernatural\noperations of the Deity.  I propose to you that we do not yet\nconsider this divergence final, but leave the question for a\nwhile in abeyance–continued inquiry may enable us to get rid of\nsome of the apparent discord.",

        "When you find a man living on the ragged edge of his\nconsciousness, pent in to his sin and want and incompleteness,\nand consequently inconsolable, and then simply tell him that all\nis well with him, that he must stop his worry, break with his\ndiscontent, and give up his anxiety, you seem to him to come with\npure absurdities.  The only positive consciousness he has tells\nhim that all is NOT well, and the better way you offer sounds\nsimply as if you proposed to him to assert cold-blooded\nfalsehoods.  “The will to believe” cannot be stretched as far as\nthat.  We can make ourselves more faithful to a belief of which\nwe have the rudiments, but we cannot create a belief out of whole\ncloth when our perception actively assures us of its opposite. \nThe better mind proposed to us comes in that case in the form of\na pure negation of the only mind we have, and we cannot actively\nwill a pure negation.",
        "There are only two ways in which it is possible to get rid of\nanger, worry, fear, despair, or other undesirable affections. \nOne is that an opposite affection should overpoweringly break\nover us, and the other is by getting so exhausted with the\nstruggle that we have to stop–so we drop down, give up, and\nDON’T CARE any longer.  Our emotional brain-centres strike work,\nand we lapse into a temporary apathy. Now there is documentary\nproof that this state of temporary exhaustion not infrequently\nforms part of the conversion crisis.  So long as the egoistic\nworry of the sick soul guards the door, the expansive confidence\nof the soul of faith gains no presence.  But let the former faint\naway, even but for a moment, and the latter can profit by the\nopportunity, and, having once acquired possession, may retain it.",

        "Let me give you a good illustration of this feature in the\nconversion process.  That genuine saint, David Brainerd,\ndescribes his own crisis in the following words:–",
        "“One morning, while I was walking in a solitary place as usual, I\nat once saw that all my contrivances and projects to effect or\nprocure deliverance and salvation for myself were utterly in\nvain; I was brought quite to a stand, as finding myself totally\nlost.  I saw that it was forever impossible for me to do anything\ntowards helping or delivering myself, that I had made all the\npleas I ever could have made to all eternity; and that all my\npleas were vain, for I saw that self-interest had led me to pray,\nand that I had never once prayed from any respect to the glory of\nGod.  I saw that there was no necessary connection between my\nprayers and the bestowment of divine mercy, that they laid not\nthe least obligation upon God to bestow his grace upon me; and\nthat there was no more virtue or goodness in them than there\nwould be in my paddling with my hand in the water.  I saw that I\nhad been heaping up my devotions before God, fasting, praying,\netc., pretending, and indeed really thinking sometimes that I was\naiming at the glory of God; whereas I never once truly intended\nit, but only my own happiness.  I saw that as I had never done\nanything for God, I had no claim on anything from him but\nperdition, on account of my hypocrisy and mockery.  When I saw\nevidently that I had regard to nothing but self-interest, then my\nduties appeared a vile mockery and a continual course of lies,\nfor the whole was nothing but self-worship, and an horrid abuse\nof God.",
        "“I continued, as I remember, in this state of mind, from Friday\nmorning till the Sabbath evening following (July 12, 1739), when\nI was walking again in the same solitary place.  Here, in a\nmournful melancholy state I was attempting to pray; but found no\nheart to engage in that or any other duty; my former concern,\nexercise, and religious affections were now gone. I thought that\nthe Spirit of God had quite left me; but still was NOT\nDISTRESSED; yet disconsolate, as if there was nothing in heaven\nor earth could make me happy.  Having been thus endeavoring to\npray–though, as I thought, very stupid and senseless–for near\nhalf an hour; then, as I was walking in a thick grove,\nunspeakable glory seemed to open to the apprehension of my soul. \nI do not mean any external brightness, nor any imagination of a\nbody of light, but it was a new inward apprehension or view that\nI had of God, such as I never had before, nor anything which had\nthe least resemblance to it.  I had no particular apprehension of\nany one person in the Trinity, either the Father, the Son, or the\nHoly Ghost; but it appeared to be Divine glory.  My soul rejoiced\nwith joy unspeakable, to see such a God, such a glorious Divine\nBeing; and I was inwardly pleased and satisfied that he should be\nGod over all for ever and ever.  My soul was so captivated and\ndelighted with the excellency of God that I was even swallowed up\nin him, at least to that degree that I had no thought about my\nown salvation, and scarce reflected that there was such a\ncreature as myself.  I continued in this state of inward joy,\npeace, and astonishing, till near dark without any sensible\nabatement; and then began to think and examine what I had seen;\nand felt sweetly composed in my mind all the evening following. \nI felt myself in a new world, and everything about me appeared\nwith a different aspect from what it was wont to do.  At this\ntime, the way of salvation opened to me with such infinite\nwisdom, suitableness, and excellency, that I wondered I should\never think of any other way of salvation; was amazed that I had\nnot dropped my own contrivances, and complied with this lovely,\nblessed, and excellent way before.  If I could have been saved by\nmy own duties or any other way that I had formerly contrived, my\nwhole soul would now have refused it.  I wondered that all the\nworld did not see and comply with this way of salvation, entirely\nby the righteousness of Christ.\"[116]",

In a large proportion, \nperhaps the majority, of reports, the writers speak as if the\nexhaustion of the lower and the entrance of the higher emotion\nwere simultaneous,[117] yet often again they speak as if the\nhigher actively drove the lower out.  This is undoubtedly true in\na great many instances, as we shall presently see.

        "“As I was about sunset wandering in the fields lamenting my\nmiserable lost and undone condition, and almost ready to sink\nunder my burden, I thought I was in such a miserable case as\nnever any man was before.  I returned to the house, and when I\ngot to the door, just as I was stepping off the threshold, the\nfollowing impressions came into my mind like a powerful but small\nstill voice.  You have been seeking, praying, reforming,\nlaboring, reading, hearing, and meditating, and what have you\ndone by it towards your salvation?  Are you any nearer to\nconversion now than when you first began?  Are you any more\nprepared for heaven, or fitter to appear before the impartial bar\nof God, than when you first began to seek?",
        "“It brought such conviction on me that I was obliged to say that\nI did not think I was one step nearer than at first, but as much\ncondemned, as much exposed, and as miserable as before. I cried\nout within myself, O Lord God, I am lost, and if thou, O Lord,\ndost not find out some new way, I know nothing of, I shall never\nbe saved, for the ways and methods I have prescribed to myself\nhave all failed me, and I am willing they should fail. O Lord,\nhave mercy! O Lord, have mercy!",
        "“These discoveries continued until I went into the house and sat\ndown.  After I sat down, being all in confusion, like a drowning\nman that was just giving up to sink, and almost in an agony, I\nturned very suddenly round in my chair, and seeing part of an old\nBible lying in one of the chairs, I caught hold of it in great\nhaste; and opening it without any premeditation, cast my eyes on\nthe 38th Psalm, which was the first time I ever saw the word of\nGod:  it took hold of me with such power that it seemed to go\nthrough my whole soul, so that it seemed as if God was praying\nin, with, and for me.  About this time my father called the\nfamily to attend prayers; I attended, but paid no regard to what\nhe said in his prayer, but continued praying in those words of\nthe Psalm.  Oh, help me, help me! cried I, thou Redeemer of\nsouls, and save me, or I am gone forever; thou canst this night,\nif thou pleasest, with one drop of thy blood atone for my sins,\nand appease the wrath of an angry God.  At that instant of time\nwhen I gave all up to him to do with me as he pleased, and was\nwilling that God should rule over me at his pleasure, redeeming\nlove broke into my soul with repeated scriptures, with such power\nthat my whole soul seemed to be melted down with love, the burden\nof guilt and condemnation was gone, darkness was expelled, my\nheart humbled and filled with gratitude, and my whole soul, that\nwas a few minutes ago groaning under mountains of death, and\ncrying to an unknown God for help, was now filled with immortal\nlove, soaring on the wings of faith,<215> freed from the chains\nof death and darkness, and crying out, My Lord and my God; thou\nart my rock and my fortress, my shield and my high tower, my\nlife, my joy, my present and my everlasting portion.  Looking up,\nI thought I saw that same light [he had on more than one previous\noccasion seen subjectively a bright blaze of light], though it\nappeared different; and as soon as I saw it, the design was\nopened to me, according to his promise, and I was obliged to cry\nout:  Enough, enough, O blessed God! The work of conversion, the\nchange, and the manifestations of it are no more disputable than\nthat light which I see, or anything that ever I saw.",
        "“In the midst of all my joys, in less than half an hour after my\nsoul was set at liberty, the Lord discovered to me my labor in\nthe ministry and call to preach the gospel.  I cried out, Amen,\nLord, I’ll go; send me, send me.  I spent the greatest part of\nthe night in ecstasies of joy, praising and adoring the Ancient\nof Days for his free and unbounded grace.  After I had been so\nlong in this transport and heavenly frame that my nature seemed\nto require sleep, I thought to close my eyes for a few moments;\nthen the devil stepped in, and told me that if I went to sleep, I\nshould lose it all, and when I should awake in the morning I\nwould find it to be nothing but a fancy and delusion. I\nimmediately cried out, O Lord God, if I am deceived, undeceive\nme.",
        "“I then closed my eyes for a few minutes, and seemed to be\nrefreshed with sleep; and when I awoke, the first inquiry was,\nWhere is my God?  And in an instant of time, my soul seemed awake\nin and with God, and surrounded by the arms of everlasting love. \nAbout sunrise I arose with joy to relate to my parents what God\nhad done for my soul, and declared to them the miracle of God’s\nunbounded grace.  I took a Bible to show them the words that were\nimpressed by God on my soul the evening before; but when I came\nto open the Bible, it appeared all new to me.",

But happy as he became in\nhis strenuous way, he never got his taste for even the most\ninnocent carnal pleasures back.  We must class him, like Bunyan\nand Tolstoy, amongst those upon whose soul the iron of melancholy\nleft a permanent imprint.

So I lived, sometimes drunk for a week\ntogether, and then a terrible repentance, and would not touch a\ndrop for a whole month.",
        "“In all this period, that is, up to thirty-three years of age, I\nnever had a desire to reform on religious grounds.  But all my \npangs were due to some terrible remorse I used to feel after a\nheavy carousal, the remorse taking the shape of regret after my\nfolly in wasting my life in such a way–a man of superior talents\nand education.  This terrible remorse turned me gray in one\nnight, and whenever it came upon me I was perceptibly grayer the\nnext morning.  What I suffered in this way is beyond the\nexpression of words.  It was hell-fire in all its most dreadful\ntortures.  Often did I vow that if I got over ’this time’ I would\nreform.  Alas, in about three days I fully recovered, and was as\nhappy as ever.  So it went on for years, but, with a physique\nlike a rhinoceros, I always recovered, and as long as I let drink\nalone, no man was as capable of enjoying life as I was.",
        "“I was converted in my own bedroom in my father’s rectory house\nat precisely three o’clock in the afternoon of a hot July day\n(July 13, 1886).  I was in perfect health, having been off from\nthe drink for nearly a month.  I was in no way troubled about my\nsoul.  In fact, God was not in my thoughts that day.  A young\nlady friend sent me a copy of Professor Drummond’s Natural Law in\nthe Spiritual World, asking me my opinion of it as a literary\nwork only.  Being proud of my critical talents and wishing to\nenhance myself in my new friend’s esteem, I took the book to my\nbedroom for quiet, intending to give it a thorough study, and\nthen write her what I thought of it.  It was here that God met me\nface to face, and I shall never forget the meeting.  ’He that\nhath the Son hath life eternal, he that hath not the Son hath not\nlife.’  I had read this scores of times before, but this made all\nthe difference.  I was now in God’s presence and my attention was\nabsolutely ’soldered’ on to this verse, and I was not allowed to\nproceed with the book till I had fairly considered what these\nwords really involved.  Only then was I allowed to proceed,\nfeeling all the while that there was another being in my bedroom,\nthough not seen by me.  The stillness was very marvelous, and I\nfelt supremely happy.  It was most unquestionably shown me, in\none second of time, that I had never touched the Eternal:  and\nthat if I died then, I must inevitably be lost. I was undone.  I\nknew it as well as I now know I am saved.  The Spirit of God\nshowed it me in ineffable love; there was no terror in it; I felt\nGod’s love so powerfully upon me that only a mighty sorrow crept\nover me that I had lost all through my own folly; and what was I\nto do?  What could I do?  I did not repent even; God never asked\nme to repent.  All I felt was ’I am undone,’ and God cannot help\nit, although he loves me.  No fault on the part of the Almighty. \nAll the time I was supremely happy:  I felt like a little child\nbefore his father.  I had done wrong, but my Father did not scold\nme, but loved me most wondrously.  Still my doom was sealed.  I\nwas lost to a certainty, and being naturally of a brave\ndisposition I did not quail under it, but deep sorrow\nfor the past, mixed with regret for what I had lost, took hold\nupon me, and my soul thrilled within me to think it was all over.\nThen there crept in upon me so gently, so lovingly, so\nunmistakably, a way of escape, and what was it after all?  The\nold, old story over again, told in the simplest way:  ’There is\nno name under heaven whereby ye can be saved except that of the\nLord Jesus Christ.’ No words were spoken to me; my soul seemed to\nsee my Saviour in the spirit, and from that hour to this, nearly\nnine years now, there has never been in my life one doubt that\nthe Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father both worked upon me that\nafternoon in July, both differently, and both in the most perfect\nlove conceivable, and I rejoiced there and then in a conversion\nso astounding that the whole village heard of it in less than\ntwenty-four hours.",
        "“But a time of trouble was yet to come.  The day after my\nconversion I went into the hay-field to lend a hand with the\nharvest, and not having made any promise to God to abstain or\ndrink in moderation only, I took too much and came home drunk. \nMy poor sister was heart-broken; and I felt ashamed of myself and\ngot to my bedroom at once, where she followed me weeping\ncopiously.  She said I had been converted and fallen away\ninstantly.  But although I was quite full of drink (not muddled,\nhowever), I knew that God’s work begun in me was not going to be\nwasted.  About midday I made on my knees the first prayer before\nGod for twenty years.  I did not ask to be forgiven; I felt that\nwas no good, for I would be sure to fall again.  Well, what did I\ndo?  I committed myself to him in the profoundest belief that my\nindividuality was going to be destroyed, that he would take all\nfrom me, and I was willing.  In such a <219> surrender lies the\nsecret of a holy life.  From that hour drink has had no terrors\nfor me:  I never touch it, never want it.  The same thing\noccurred with my pipe:  after being a regular smoker from my\ntwelfth year the desire for it went at once, and has never\nreturned.  So with every known sin, the deliverance in each case\nbeing permanent and complete.  I have had no temptation since\nconversion, God seemingly having shut out Satan from that course\nwith me.  He gets a free hand in other ways, but never on sins of\nthe flesh.  Since I gave up to God all ownership in my own life,\nhe has guided me in a thousand ways, and has opened my path in a\nway almost incredible to those who do not enjoy the blessing of a\ntruly surrendered life.”",

        "The most curious record of sudden conversion with which I am\nacquainted is that of M. Alphonse Ratisbonne, a free-thinking\nFrench Jew, to Catholicism, at Rome in 1842.  In a letter to a\nclerical friend, written a few months later, the convert gives a\npalpitating account of the circumstances.[121] The predisposing\nconditions appear to have been slight.  He had an elder brother\nwho had been converted and was a Catholic priest.  He was himself\nirreligious, and nourished an antipathy to the apostate brother\nand generally to his “cloth.”  Finding himself at Rome in his\ntwenty-ninth year, he fell in with a French gentleman who tried\nto make a proselyte of him, but who succeeded no farther after\ntwo or three conversations than to get him to hang (half\njocosely) a religious medal round his neck, and to accept and\nread a copy of a short prayer to the Virgin.  M. Ratisbonne\nrepresents his own part in the conversations as having been of a\nlight and chaffing order; but he notes the fact that for some\ndays he was unable to banish the words of the prayer from his\nmind, and that the night before the crisis he had a sort of\nnightmare, in the imagery of which a black cross with no Christ\nupon it figured.  Nevertheless, until noon of the next day he was\nfree in mind and spent the time in trivial conversations.  I now\ngive his own words.",

He stopped and invited me in for a drive,\nbut first asked me to wait for a few minutes whilst he attended\nto some duty at the church of San Andrea delle Fratte.  Instead\nof waiting in the carriage, I entered the church myself to look\nat it.  The church of San Andrea was poor, small, and empty; I\nbelieve that I found myself there almost alone.  No work of art\nattracted my attention; and I passed my eyes mechanically over\nits interior without being arrested by any particular thought.  I\ncan only remember an entirely black dog which went trotting and\nturning before me as I mused.  In an instant the dog had\ndisappeared, the whole church had vanished, I no longer saw\nanything, . . . or more truly I saw, O my God, one thing alone. \n\"Heavens, how can I speak of it?  Oh no! human words cannot\nattain to expressing the inexpressible.  Any description, however\nsublime it might be, could be but a profanation of the\nunspeakable truth.",

I could\nnot reply to the questions which followed from him one upon the\nother.  But finally I took the medal which I had on my breast,\nand with all the effusion of my soul I kissed the image of the\nVirgin, radiant with grace, which it bore.  Oh, indeed, it was\nShe! It was indeed She! [What he had seen had been a vision of\nthe Virgin.]",
        "“I did not know where I was:  I did not know whether I was\nAlphonse or another.  I only felt myself changed and believed\nmyself another me; I looked for myself in myself and did not find\nmyself.  In the bottom of my soul I felt an explosion of the most\nardent joy; I could not speak; I had no wish to reveal what had\nhappened.  But I felt something solemn and sacred within me which\nmade me ask for a priest.  I was led to one; and there alone,\nafter he had given me the positive order, I spoke as best I\ncould, kneeling, and with my heart still trembling.  I could give\nno account to myself of the truth of which I had acquired a\nknowledge and a faith.  All that I can say is that in an instant\nthe bandage had fallen from my eyes, and not one bandage only,\nbut the whole manifold of bandages in which I had been brought\nup.  One after another they rapidly disappeared, even as the mud\nand ice disappear under the rays of the burning sun.",
        "“I came out as from a sepulchre, from an abyss of darkness; and I\nwas living, perfectly living.  But I wept, for at the bottom of\nthat gulf I saw the extreme of misery from which I had been saved\nby an infinite mercy; and I shuddered at the sight of my\niniquities, stupefied, melted, overwhelmed with wonder and with\ngratitude.  You may ask me how I came to this new insight, for\ntruly I had never opened a book of religion nor even read a\nsingle page of the Bible, and the dogma of original sin is either\nentirely denied or forgotten by the Hebrews of to-day, so that I\nhad thought so little about it that I doubt whether I ever knew\nits name.  But how came I, then, to this perception of it?  I can\n<222> answer nothing save this, that on entering that church I\nwas in darkness altogether, and on coming out of it I saw the\nfullness of the light.  I can explain the change no better than\nby the simile of a profound sleep or the analogy of one born\nblind who should suddenly open his eyes to the day.  He sees, but\ncannot define the light which bathes him and by means of which he\nsees the objects which excite his wonder.  If we cannot explain\nphysical light, how can we explain the light which is the truth\nitself?  And I think I remain within the limits of veracity when\nI say that without having any knowledge of the letter of\nreligious doctrine, I now intuitively perceived its sense and\nspirit. Better than if I saw them, I FELT those hidden things; I\nfelt them by the inexplicable effects they produced in me.  It\nall happened in my interior mind, and those impressions, more\nrapid than thought shook my soul, revolved and turned it, as it\nwere, in another direction, towards other aims, by other paths. \nI express myself badly.  But do you wish, Lord, that I should\ninclose in poor and barren words sentiments which the heart alone\ncan understand?”",
        "I might multiply cases almost indefinitely, but these will\nsuffice to show you how real, definite, and memorable an event a\nsudden conversion may be to him who has the experience.\nThroughout the height of it he undoubtedly seems to himself a\npassive spectator or undergoer of an astounding process performed\nupon him from above.  There is too much evidence of this for any\ndoubt of it to be possible.  Theology, combining this fact with\nthe doctrines of election and grace, has concluded that the\nspirit of God is with us at these dramatic moments in a\npeculiarly miraculous way, unlike what happens at any other\njuncture of our lives.  At that moment, it believes, an\nabsolutely new nature is breathed into us, and we become\npartakers of the very substance of the Deity.",
        "That the conversion should be instantaneous seems called for on\nthis view, and the Moravian Protestants appear to have been the\nfirst to see this logical consequence.  The Methodists soon\nfollowed suit, practically if not dogmatically, and a short time\nere his death, John Wesley wrote:–",
        "“In London alone I found 652 members of our Society who were\nexceeding clear in their experience, and whose testimony I could\nsee no reason to doubt.  And every one of these (without a single\nexception) has declared that his deliverance from sin was\ninstantaneous; that the change was wrought in a moment.  Had half\nof these, or one third, or one in twenty, declared it was\nGRADUALLY wrought in THEM, I should have believed this, with\nregard to THEM, and thought that SOME were gradually sanctified\nand some instantaneously.  But as I have not found, in so long a\nspace of time, a single person speaking thus, I cannot but\nbelieve that sanctification is commonly, if not always, an\ninstantaneous work.\"[122]",
        "[122] Tyerman’s Life of Wesley, i. 463.",
        "All this while the more usual sects of Protestantism have set no\nsuch store by instantaneous conversion.  For them as for the\nCatholic Church, Christ’s blood, the sacraments, and the\nindividual’s ordinary religious duties are practically supposed\nto suffice to his salvation, even though no acute crisis of\nself-despair and surrender followed by relief should be\nexperienced.  For Methodism, on the contrary, unless there have\nbeen a crisis of this sort, salvation is only offered, not\neffectively received, and Christ’s sacrifice in so far forth is\nincomplete.  Methodism surely here follows, if not the healthier-\nminded, yet on the whole the profounder spiritual instinct. The\nindividual models which it has set up as typical and worthy of\nimitation are not only the more interesting dramatically, but\npsychologically they have been the more complete.",
        "In the fully evolved Revivalism of Great Britain and America we\nhave, so to speak, the codified and stereotyped procedure to\nwhich this way of thinking has led.  In spite of the\nunquestionable fact that saints of the once-born type exist, that\nthere may be a gradual growth in holiness without a cataclysm; in\nspite of the obvious leakage (as one may say) of much mere\nnatural goodness into the scheme of salvation; revivalism has\nalways assumed that only its own type of religious experience can\nbe perfect; you must first be nailed on the cross of natural\ndespair and agony, and then in the twinkling of an eye be\nmiraculously released.",
        "It is natural that those who personally have traversed such an\nexperience should carry away a feeling of its being a miracle\nrather than a natural process.  Voices are often heard, lights\nseen, or visions witnessed; automatic motor phenomena occur; and\nit always seems, after the surrender of the personal will, as if\nan extraneous higher power had flooded in and taken possession. \nMoreover the sense of renovation, safety, cleanness, rightness,\ncan be so marvelous and jubilant as well to warrant one’s belief\nin a radically new substantial nature.",
        "“Conversion,” writes the New England Puritan, Joseph Alleine, “is\nnot the putting in a patch of holiness; but with the true convert\nholiness is woven into all his powers, principles, and practice. \nThe sincere Christian is quite a new fabric, from the foundation\nto the top-stone.  He is a new man, a new creature.”",
        "And Jonathan Edwards says in the same strain:  “Those gracious\ninfluences which are the effects of the Spirit of God are\naltogether supernatural–are quite different from anything that\nunregenerate men experience.  They are what no improvement, or\ncomposition of natural qualifications or principles will ever\nproduce; because they not only differ from what is natural, and\nfrom everything that natural men experience in degree and\ncircumstances, but also in kind, and are of a nature far more\nexcellent. From hence it follows that in gracious affections\nthere are [also] new perceptions and sensations entirely\ndifferent in their nature and kind from anything experienced by\nthe [same] saints before they were sanctified. . . .  The\nconceptions which the saints have of the loveliness of God, and\nthat kind of delight which they experience in it, are quite\npeculiar, and entirely different from anything which a natural\nman can possess, or of which he can form any proper notion.”",
        "And that such a glorious transformation as this ought of\nnecessity to be preceded by despair is shown by Edwards in\nanother passage.",
        "“Surely it cannot be unreasonable,” he says, “that before God\ndelivers us from a state of sin and liability to everlasting woe,\nhe should give us some considerable sense of the evil from which\nhe delivers us, in order that we may know and feel the importance\nof salvation, and be enabled to appreciate the value of what God\nis pleased to do for us.  As those who are saved are successively\nin two extremely different states–first in a state of\ncondemnation and then in a state of justification and\nblessedness–and as God, in the salvation of men, deals with them\nas rational and intelligent creatures, it appears agreeable to\nthis wisdom, that those who are saved should be made sensible of\ntheir Being, in those two different states.  In the first place,\nthat they should be made sensible of their state of condemnation;\nand afterwards, of their state of deliverance and happiness.”",
        "Such quotations express sufficiently well for our purpose the\ndoctrinal interpretation of these changes.  Whatever part\nsuggestion and imitation may have played in producing them in men\nand women in excited assemblies, they have at any rate been in\ncountless individual instances an original and unborrowed\nexperience.  Were we writing the story of the mind from the\npurely natural-history point of view, with no religious interest\nwhatever, we should still have to write down man’s liability to\nsudden and complete conversion as one of his most curious\npeculiarities.",
        "What, now, must we ourselves think of this question?  Is an\ninstantaneous conversion a miracle in which God is present as he\nis present in no change of heart less strikingly abrupt? Are\nthere two classes of human beings, even among the apparently\nregenerate, of which the one class really partakes of Christ’s\nnature while the other merely seems to do so?  Or, on the\ncontrary, may the whole phenomenon of regeneration, even in these\nstartling instantaneous examples, possibly be a strictly natural\nprocess, divine in its fruits, of course, but in one case more\nand in another less so, and neither more nor less divine in its\nmere causation and mechanism than any other process, high or low,\nof man’s interior life?",
        "Before proceeding to answer this question, I must ask you to\nlisten to some more psychological remarks.  At our last lecture,\nI explained the shifting of men’s centres of personal energy\nwithin them and the lighting up of new crises of emotion.  I\nexplained the phenomena as partly due to explicitly conscious\nprocesses of thought and will, but as due largely also to the\nsubconscious incubation and maturing of motives deposited by the\nexperiences of life.  When ripe, the results hatch out, or burst\ninto flower.  I have now to speak of the subconscious region, in\nwhich such processes of flowering may occur, in a somewhat less\nvague way.  I only regret that my limits of time here force me to\nbe so short.",
        "The expression “field of consciousness” has but recently come\ninto vogue in the psychology books.  Until quite lately the unit\nof mental life which figured most was the single “idea,” supposed\nto be a definitely outlined thing.  But at present psychologists\nare tending, first, to admit that the actual unit is more\nprobably the total mental state, the entire wave of consciousness\nor field of objects present to the thought at any time; and,\nsecond, to see that it is impossible to outline this wave, this\nfield, with any definiteness.",
        "As our mental fields succeed one another, each has its centre of\ninterest, around which the objects of which we are less and less\nattentively conscious fade to a margin so faint that its limits\nare unassignable.  Some fields are narrow fields and some are\nwide fields.  Usually when we have a wide field we rejoice, for\nwe then see masses of truth together, and often get glimpses of\nrelations which we divine rather than see, for they shoot beyond\nthe field into still remoter regions of objectivity, regions\nwhich we seem rather to be about to perceive than to perceive\nactually.  At other times, of drowsiness, illness, or fatigue,\nour fields may narrow almost to a point, and we find ourselves\ncorrespondingly oppressed and contracted.",
        "Different individuals present constitutional differences in this\nmatter of width of field.  Your great organizing geniuses are men\nwith habitually vast fields of mental vision, in which a whole\nprogramme of future operations will appear dotted out at once,\nthe rays shooting far ahead into definite directions of advance. \nIn common people there is never this magnificent inclusive view\nof a topic.  They stumble along, feeling their way, as it were,\nfrom point to point, and often stop entirely.  In certain\ndiseased conditions consciousness is a mere spark, without memory\nof the past or thought of the future, and with the present\nnarrowed down to some one simple emotion or sensation of the\nbody.",
        "The important fact which this “field” formula commemorates is the\nindetermination of the margin.  Inattentively realized as is the\nmatter which the margin contains, it is nevertheless there, and\nhelps both to guide our behavior and to determine the next\nmovement of our attention.  It lies around us like a “magnetic\nfield,” inside of which our centre of energy turns like a\ncompass-needle, as the present phase of consciousness alters into\nits successor.  Our whole past store of memories floats beyond\nthis margin, ready at a touch to come in; and the entire mass of\nresidual powers, impulses, and knowledges that constitute our\nempirical self stretches continuously beyond it.  So vaguely\ndrawn are the outlines between what is actual and what is only\npotential at any moment of our conscious life, that it is always\nhard to say of certain mental elements whether we are conscious\nof them or not.",
        "The ordinary psychology, admitting fully the difficulty of\ntracing the marginal outline, has nevertheless taken for <228>\ngranted, first, that all the consciousness the person now has, be\nthe same focal or marginal, inattentive or attentive, is there in\nthe “field” of the moment, all dim and impossible to assign as\nthe latter’s outline may be; and, second, that what is absolutely\nextra-marginal is absolutely non-existent. and cannot be a fact\nof consciousness at all.",
        "And having reached this point, I must now ask you to recall what\nI said in my last lecture about the subconscious life.  I said,\nas you may recollect, that those who first laid stress upon these\nphenomena could not know the facts as we now know them.  My first\nduty now is to tell you what I meant by such a statement.",
        "I cannot but think that the most important step forward that has\noccurred in psychology since I have been a student of that\nscience is the discovery, first made in 1886, that, in certain\nsubjects at least, there is not only the consciousness of the\nordinary field, with its usual centre and margin, but an addition\nthereto in the shape of a set of memories, thoughts, and feelings\nwhich are extra-marginal and outside of the primary consciousness\naltogether, but yet must be classed as conscious facts of some\nsort, able to reveal their presence by unmistakable signs.  I\ncall this the most important step forward because, unlike the\nother advances which psychology has made, this discovery has\nrevealed to us an entirely unsuspected peculiarity in the\nconstitution of human nature.  No other step forward which\npsychology has made can proffer any such claim as this.",
        "In particular this discovery of a consciousness existing beyond\nthe field, or subliminally as Mr. Myers terms it, casts light on\nmany phenomena of religious biography.  That is why I have to\nadvert to it now, although it is naturally impossible for me in\nthis place to give you any account of the evidence on which the\nadmission of such a consciousness is based.  You will find it set\nforth in many recent books, Binet’s Alterations of\nPersonality[123] being perhaps as good a one as any to recommend.",
        "[123] Published in the International Scientific Series.",
        "The human material on which the demonstration has been made has\nso far been rather limited and, in part at least, eccentric,\nconsisting of unusually suggestible hypnotic subjects, and of\nhysteric patients.  Yet the elementary mechanisms of our life are\npresumably so uniform that what is shown to be true in a marked\ndegree of some persons is probably true in some degree of all,\nand may in a few be true in an extraordinarily high degree.",
        "The most important consequence of having a strongly developed\nultra-marginal life of this sort is that one’s ordinary fields of\nconsciousness are liable to incursions from it of which the\nsubject does not guess the source, and which, therefore, take for\nhim the form of unaccountable impulses to act, or inhibitions of\naction, of obsessive ideas, or even of hallucinations of sight or\nhearing.  The impulses may take the direction of automatic speech\nor writing, the meaning of which the subject himself may not\nunderstand even while he utters it; and generalizing this\nphenomenon, Mr. Myers has given the name of automatism, sensory\nor motor, emotional or intellectual, to this whole sphere of\neffects, due to “up-rushes” into the ordinary consciousness of\nenergies originating in the subliminal parts of the mind.",
        "The simplest instance of an automatism is the phenomenon of\npost-hypnotic suggestion, so-called.  You give to a hypnotized\nsubject, adequately susceptible, an order to perform some\ndesignated act–usual or eccentric, it makes no difference–\nafter he wakes from his hypnotic sleep. Punctually, when the\nsignal comes or the time elapses upon which you have told him\nthat the act must ensue, he performs it;–but in so doing he has\nno recollection of your suggestion, and he always trumps up an\nimprovised pretext for his behavior if the act be of an eccentric\nkind.  It may even be suggested to a subject to have a vision or\nto hear a voice at a certain interval after waking, and when the\ntime comes the vision is seen or the voice heard, with no inkling\non the subject’s part of its source.",
        "In the wonderful explorations by Binet, Janet, Breuer, Freud,\nMason, Prince, and others, of the subliminal consciousness of\npatients with hysteria, we have revealed to us whole systems of\nunderground life, in the shape of memories of a painful sort\nwhich lead a parasitic existence, buried outside of the primary\nfields of consciousness, and making irruptions thereinto with\nhallucinations, pains, convulsions, paralyses of feeling and of\nmotion, and the whole procession of symptoms of hysteric disease\nof body and of mind.  Alter or abolish by suggestion these\nsubconscious memories, and the patient immediately gets well. \nHis symptoms were automatisms, in Mr. Myers’s sense of the word. \nThese clinical records sound like fairy-tales when one first\nreads them, yet it is impossible to doubt their accuracy; and,\nthe path having been once opened by these first observers,\nsimilar observations have been made elsewhere.  They throw, as I\nsaid, a wholly new light upon our natural constitution.",
        "And it seems to me that they make a farther step inevitable.\nInterpreting the unknown after the analogy of the known, it seems\nto me that hereafter, wherever we meet with a phenomenon of\nautomatism, be it motor impulses, or obsessive idea, or\nunaccountable caprice, or delusion, or hallucination, we are\nbound first of all to make search whether it be not an explosion,\ninto the fields of ordinary consciousness, of ideas elaborated\noutside of those fields in subliminal regions of the mind.  We\nshould look, therefore, for its source in the Subject’s\nsubconscious life.  In the hypnotic cases, we ourselves create\nthe source by our suggestion, so we know it directly.  In the\nhysteric cases, the lost memories which are the source have to be\nextracted from the patient’s Subliminal by a number of ingenious\nmethods, for an account of which you must consult the books.  In\nother pathological cases, insane delusions, for example, or\npsychopathic obsessions, the source is yet to seek, but by\nanalogy it also should be in subliminal regions which\nimprovements in our methods may yet conceivably put on tap. There\nlies the mechanism logically to be assumed–but the assumption\ninvolves a vast program of work to be done in the way of\nverification, in which the religious experiences of man must play\ntheir part.[124]",
        "[124] The reader will here please notice that in my exclusive\nreliance in the last lecture on the subconscious “incubation” of\nmotives deposited by a growing experience, I followed the method\nof employing accepted principles of explanation as far as one\ncan.  The subliminal region, whatever else it may be, is at any\nrate a place now admitted by psychologists to exist for the\naccumulation of vestiges of sensible experience (whether\ninattentively or attentively registered), and for their\nelaboration according to ordinary psychological or logical laws\ninto results that end by attaining such a “tension\"that they may\nat times enter consciousness with something like a burst.  It\nthus is “scientific” to interpret all otherwise unaccountable\ninvasive alterations of consciousness as results of the tension\nof subliminal memories reaching the bursting-point.  But candor\nobliges me to confess that there are occasional bursts into\nconsciousness of results of which it is not easy to demonstrate\nany prolonged subconscious incubation.  Some of the cases I used\nto illustrate the sense of presence of the unseen in Lecture III\nwere of this order (compare pages 59, 60, 61, 66); and we\nshall see other experiences of the kind when we come to the\nsubject of mysticism.  The case of Mr. Bradley, that of M.\nRatisbonne, possibly that of Colonel Gardiner, possibly that of\nsaint Paul, might not be so easily explained in this simple way. \nThe result, then, would have to be ascribed either to a merely\nphysiological nerve storm, a “discharging lesion” like that of\nepilepsy; or, in case it were useful and rational, as in the two\nlatter cases named, to some more mystical or theological\nhypothesis. I make this remark in order that the reader may\nrealize that the subject is really complex.  But I shall keep\nmyself as far as possible at present to the more “scientific\"\nview; and only as the plot thickens in subsequent lectures shall\nI consider the question of its absolute sufficiency as an\nexplanation of all the facts.  That subconscious incubation\nexplains a great number of them, there can be no doubt.",
        "And thus I return to our own specific subject of instantaneous\nconversions.  You remember the cases of Alline, Bradley,\nBrainerd, and the graduate of Oxford converted at three in the\nafternoon.  Similar occurrences abound, some with and some\nwithout luminous visions, all with a sense of astonished\nhappiness, and of being wrought on by a higher control.  If,\nabstracting altogether from the question of their value for the\nfuture spiritual life of the individual, we take them on their\npsychological side exclusively, so many peculiarities in them\nremind us of what we find outside of conversion that we are\ntempted to class them along with other automatisms, and to\nsuspect that what makes the difference between a sudden and a\ngradual convert is not necessarily the presence of divine miracle\nin the case of one and of something less divine in that of the\nother, but rather a simple psychological peculiarity, the fact,\nnamely, that in the recipient of the more instantaneous grace we\nhave one of those Subjects who are in possession of a large\nregion in which mental work can go on subliminally, and from\nwhich invasive experiences, abruptly upsetting the equilibrium of\nthe primary consciousness, may come.",
        "I do not see why Methodists need object to such a view. Pray go\nback and recollect one of the conclusions to which I sought to\nlead you in my very first lecture.  You may remember how I there\nargued against the notion that the worth of a thing can be\ndecided by its origin.  Our spiritual judgment, I said, our\nopinion of the significance and value of a human event or\ncondition, must be decided on empirical grounds exclusively.  If\nthe fruits for life of the state of conversion are good, we ought\nto idealize and venerate it, even though it be a piece of natural\npsychology; if not, we ought to make short work with it, no\nmatter what supernatural being may have infused it.",
        "Well, how is it with these fruits?  If we except the class of\npreeminent saints of whom the names illumine history, and \nconsider only the usual run of “saints,” the shopkeeping\nchurch-members and ordinary youthful or middle-aged recipients of\ninstantaneous conversion, whether at revivals or in the\nspontaneous course of methodistic growth, you will probably agree\nthat no splendor worthy of a wholly supernatural creature\nfulgurates from them, or sets them apart from the mortals who\nhave never experienced that favor. Were it true that a suddenly\nconverted man as such is, as Edwards says,[125] of an entirely\ndifferent kind from a natural man, partaking as he does directly\nof Christ’s substance, there surely ought to be some exquisite\nclass-mark, some distinctive radiance attaching even to the\nlowliest specimen of this genus, to which no one of us could\nremain insensible, and which, so far as it went, would prove him\nmore excellent than ever the most highly gifted among mere\nnatural men.  But notoriously there is no such radiance. \nConverted men as a class are indistinguishable from natural men;\nsome natural men even excel some converted men in their fruits;\nand no one ignorant of doctrinal theology could guess by mere\nevery-day inspection of the “accidents” of the two groups of\npersons before him, that their substance differed as much as\ndivine differs from human substance.",
        "[125] Edwards says elsewhere:  “I am bold to say that the work of\nGod in the conversion of one soul, considered together with the\nsource foundation, and purchase of it, and also the benefit, end,\nand eternal issue of it, is a more glorious work of God than the\ncreation of the whole material universe.”",
        "The believers in the non-natural character of sudden conversion\nhave had practically to admit that there is no unmistakable\nclass-mark distinctive of all true converts.  The super-normal\nincidents, such as voices and visions and overpowering\nimpressions of the meaning of suddenly presented scripture texts,\nthe melting emotions and tumultuous affections connected with the\ncrisis of change, may all come by way of nature, or worse still,\nbe counterfeited by Satan.  The real witness of the spirit to the\nsecond birth is to be found only in the disposition of the\ngenuine child of God, the permanently patient heart, the love of\nself eradicated.  And this, it has to be admitted, is also found\nin those who pass no crisis, and may even be found outside of\nChristianity altogether.",
        "Throughout Jonathan Edwards’s admirably rich and delicate\ndescription of the supernaturally infused condition, in his\nTreatise on Religious Affections, there is not one decisive\ntrait, not one mark, that unmistakably parts it off from what may\npossibly be only an exceptionally high degree of natural\ngoodness.  In fact, one could hardly read a clearer argument than\nthis book unwittingly offers in favor of the thesis that no chasm\nexists between the orders of human excellence, but that here as\nelsewhere, nature shows continuous differences, and generation\nand regeneration are matters of degree.",
        "All which denial of two objective classes of human beings\nseparated by a chasm must not leave us blind to the extraordinary\nmomentousness of the fact of his conversion to the individual\nhimself who gets converted.  There are higher and lower limits of\npossibility set to each personal life.  If a flood but goes above\none’s head, its absolute elevation becomes a matter of small\nimportance; and when we touch our own upper limit and live in our\nown highest centre of energy, we may call ourselves saved, no\nmatter how much higher some one else’s centre may be.  A small\nman’s salvation will always be a great salvation and the greatest\nof all facts FOR HIM, and we should remember this when the fruits\nof our ordinary evangelicism look discouraging.  Who knows how\nmuch less ideal still the lives of these spiritual grubs and\nearthworms, these Crumps and Stigginses, might have been, if such\npoor grace as they have received had never touched them at\nall?[126]",
        "[126] Emerson writes:  “When we see a soul whose acts are regal, \ngraceful and pleasant as roses, we must thank God that such\nthings can be and are, and not turn sourly on the angel and say: \nCrump is a better man, with his grunting resistance to all his\nnative devils.”  True enough.  Yet Crump may really be the better\nCRUMP, for his inner discords and second birth; and your\nonce-born “regal” character though indeed always better than poor\nCrump, may fall far short of what he individually might be had he\nonly some Crump-like capacity for compunction over his own\npeculiar diabolisms, graceful and pleasant and invariably\ngentlemanly as these may be.",
        "<235> If we roughly arrange human beings in classes, each class\nstanding for a grade of spiritual excellence, I believe we shall\nfind natural men and converts both sudden and gradual in all the\nclasses.  The forms which regenerative change effects have, then,\nno general spiritual significance, but only a psychological\nsignificance.  We have seen how Starbuck’s laborious statistical\nstudies tend to assimilate conversion to ordinary spiritual\ngrowth.  Another American psychologist, Prof. George A. Coe,[127]\nhas analyzed the cases of seventy-seven converts or ex-candidates\nfor conversion, known to him, and the results strikingly confirm\nthe view that sudden conversion is connected with the possession\nof an active subliminal self.  Examining his subjects with\nreference to their hypnotic sensibility and to such automatisms\nas hypnagogic hallucinations, odd impulses, religious dreams\nabout the time of their conversion, etc., he found these\nrelatively much more frequent in the group of converts whose\ntransformation had been “striking,” “striking” transformation\nbeing defined as a change which, though not necessarily\ninstantaneous, seems to the subject of it to be distinctly\ndifferent from a process of growth, however rapid.\"[128]\nCandidates for conversion at revivals are, as you know, often\ndisappointed:  they experience nothing striking.  Professor Coe\nhad a number of persons of this class among his seventy-seven\nsubjects, and they almost all, when tested by hypnotism, proved\nto belong to a subclass which he calls “spontaneous,” that is,\nfertile in self-suggestions, as distinguished from a “passive\"\nsubclass, to which most of the subjects of striking\ntransformation belonged.  His inference is that self-suggestion\nof impossibility had prevented the influence upon these persons\nof an environment which, on the more “passive” subjects, had\neasily brought forth the effects they looked for.  Sharp\ndistinctions are difficult in these regions, and Professor Coe’s\nnumbers are small.  But his methods were careful, and the results\ntally with what one might expect; and they seem, on the whole, to\njustify his practical conclusion, which is that if you should\nexpose to a converting influence a subject in whom three factors\nunite:  first, pronounced emotional sensibility; second, tendency\nto automatisms; and third, suggestibility of the passive type;\nyou might then safely predict the result:  there would be a\nsudden conversion, a transformation of the striking kind.",
        "[127] In his book, The Spiritual Life, New York, 1900.",
        "[128] Op. cit., p. 112.",
        "Does this temperamental origin diminish the significance of the\nsudden conversion when it has occurred?  Not in the least, as\nProfessor Coe well says; for “the ultimate test of religious\nvalues is nothing psychological, nothing definable in terms of\nHOW IT HAPPENS, but something ethical, definable only in terms of\nWHAT IS ATTAINED.\"[129]",
        "[129] Op. cit., p. 144",
        "As we proceed farther in our inquiry we shall see that what is\nattained is often an altogether new level of spiritual vitality,\na relatively heroic level, in which impossible things have become\npossible, and new energies and endurances are shown.  The\npersonality is changed, the man is born anew, whether or not his\npsychological idiosyncrasies are what give the particular shape\nto his metamorphosis.  “Sanctification” is the technical name of\nthis result; and erelong examples of it shall be brought before\nyou.  In this lecture I have still only to add a few remarks on\nthe assurance and peace which fill the hour of change itself.",
        "One word more, though, before proceeding to that point, lest the\nfinal purpose of my explanation of suddenness by subliminal\nactivity be misunderstood.  I do indeed believe that if the\nSubject have no liability to such subconscious activity, or if\nhis conscious fields have a hard rind of a margin that resists\nincursions from beyond it, his conversion must he gradual if it\noccur, and must resemble any simple growth into new habits.  His\npossession of a developed subliminal self, and of a leaky or\npervious margin, is thus a conditio sine qua non of the Subject’s\nbecoming converted in the instantaneous way.  But if you, being\northodox Christians, ask me as a psychologist whether the\nreference of a phenomenon to a subliminal self does not exclude\nthe notion of the direct presence of the Deity altogether, I have\nto say frankly that as a psychologist I do not see why it\nnecessarily should.  The lower manifestations of the Subliminal,\nindeed, fall within the resources of the personal subject:  his\nordinary sense-material, inattentively taken in and\nsubconsciously remembered and combined, will account for all his\nusual automatisms.  But just as our primary wide-awake\nconsciousness throws open our senses to the touch of things\nmaterial so it is logically conceivable that IF THERE BE higher\nspiritual agencies that can directly touch us, the psychological\ncondition of their doing so MIGHT BE our possession of a\nsubconscious region which alone should yield access to them.  The\nhubbub of the waking life might close a door which in the dreamy\nSubliminal might remain ajar or open.",
        "Thus that perception of external control which is so essential a\nfeature in conversion might, in some cases at any rate, be\ninterpreted as the orthodox interpret it:  forces transcending\nthe finite individual might impress him, on condition of his\nbeing what we may call a subliminal human specimen.  But in any\ncase the VALUE of these forces would have to be determined by\ntheir effects, and the mere fact of their transcendency would of\nitself establish no presumption that they were more divine than\ndiabolical.",
        "I confess that this is the way in which I should rather see the\ntopic left lying in your minds until I come to a much later\nlecture, when I hope once more to gather these dropped threads\ntogether into more definitive conclusions.  The notion of a\nsubconscious self certainly ought not at this point of our\ninquiry to be held to EXCLUDE all notion of a higher penetration.",
        "If there be higher powers able to impress us, they may get access\nto us only through the subliminal door. (See below, p. 506 ff.)",
        "Let us turn now to the feelings which immediately fill the hour\nof the conversion experience.  The first one to be noted is just\nthis sense of higher control.  It is not always, but it is very\noften present.  We saw examples of it in Alline, Bradley,\nBrainerd, and elsewhere.  The need of such a higher controlling\nagency is well expressed in the short reference which the eminent\nFrench Protestant Adolphe Monod makes to the crisis of his own\nconversion.  It was at Naples in his early manhood, in the summer\nof 1827.",
        "“My sadness,” he says, “was without limit, and having got entire\npossession of me, it filled my life from the most indifferent\nexternal acts to the most secret thoughts, and corrupted at their\nsource my feelings, my judgment, and my happiness.  It was then\nthat I saw that to expect to put a stop to this disorder by my\nreason and my will, which were themselves diseased, would be to\nact like a blind man who should pretend to correct one of his\neyes by the aid of the other equally blind one.  I had then no\nresource save in some INFLUENCE FROM WITHOUT.  I remembered the\npromise of the Holy Ghost; and what the positive declarations of\nthe Gospel had never succeeded in bringing home to me, I learned\nat last from necessity, and believed, for the first time in my\nlife, in this promise, in the only sense in which it answered the\nneeds of my soul, in that, namely, of a real external\nsupernatural action, capable of giving me thoughts, and taking\nthem away from me, and exerted on me by a God as truly master of\nmy heart as he is of the rest of nature. Renouncing then all\nmerit, all strength, abandoning all my personal resources, and\nacknowledging no other title to his mercy than my own utter\nmisery, I went home and threw myself on my knees and prayed as I\nnever yet prayed in my life.  From this day onwards a new\ninterior life began for me:  not that my melancholy had\ndisappeared, but it had lost its sting.  Hope had entered into my\nheart, and once entered on the path, the God of Jesus Christ, to\nwhom I then had learned to give myself up, little by little did\nthe rest.\"[130]",
        "[130] I piece together a quotation made by W. Monod, in his book\nla Vie, and a letter printed in the work:  Adolphe Monod:  I,.\nSouvenirs de sa Vie, 1885, p. 433.",
        "It is needless to remind you once more of the admirable congruity\nof Protestant theology with the structure of the mind as shown in\nsuch experiences.  In the extreme of melancholy the self that\nconsciously is can do absolutely nothing. It is completely\nbankrupt and without resource, and no works it can accomplish\nwill avail.  Redemption from such subjective conditions must be a\nfree gift or nothing, and grace through Christ’s accomplished\nsacrifice is such a gift.",
        "“God,” says Luther, “is the God of the humble, the miserable, the\noppressed, and the desperate, and of those that are brought even\nto nothing; and his nature is to give sight to the blind, to\ncomfort the broken-hearted, to justify sinners, to save the very\ndesperate and damned.  Now that pernicious and pestilent opinion\nof man’s own righteousness, which will not be a sinner, unclean,\nmiserable, and damnable, but righteous and holy, suffereth not\nGod to come to his own natural and proper work.  Therefore God\nmust take this maul in hand (the law, I mean) to beat in pieces\nand bring to nothing this beast with her vain confidence, that\nshe may so learn at length by her own misery that she is utterly\nforlorn and damned.  But here lieth the difficulty, that when a\nman is terrified and cast down, he is so little able to raise\nhimself up again and say, ’Now I am bruised and afflicted enough;\nnow is the time of grace; now is the time to hear Christ.’  The\nfoolishness of man’s heart is so great that then he rather\nseeketh to himself more laws to satisfy his conscience.  ’If I\nlive,’ saith he, ’I will amend my life:  I will do this, I will\ndo that.’  But here, except thou do the quite contrary, except\nthou send Moses away with his law, and in these terrors and this\nanguish lay hold upon Christ who died for thy sins, look for no\nsalvation.  Thy cowl, thy shaven crown, thy chastity, thy\nobedience, thy poverty, thy works, thy merits?  what shall all\nthese do?  what shall the law of Moses avail?  If I, wretched and\ndamnable sinner, through works or merits could have loved the Son\nof God, and so come to him, what needed he to deliver himself for\nme?  If I, being a wretch and damned sinner, could be redeemed by\nany other price, what needed the Son of God to be given?  But\nbecause there was no other price, therefore he delivered neither\nsheep, ox, gold, nor silver, but even God himself, entirely and\nwholly ’for me,’ even ’for me,’ I say, a miserable, wretched\nsinner.  Now, therefore, I take comfort and apply this to MYSELF.",
        "And this manner of applying is the very true force and power of\nfaith.  For he died NOT to justify the righteous, but the\nUN-righteous, and to make THEM the children of God.\"[131]",
        "[131] Commentary on Galatians, ch. iii. verse 19, and ch. ii.\nverse 20, abridged.",
        "That is, the more literally lost you are, the more literally you\nare the very being whom Christ’s sacrifice has already saved. \nNothing in Catholic theology, I imagine, has ever spoken to sick\nsouls as straight as this message from Luther’s personal\nexperience.  As Protestants are not all sick souls, of course\nreliance on what Luther exults in calling the dung of one’s\nmerits, the filthy puddle of one’s own righteousness, has come to\nthe front again in their religion; but the adequacy of his view\nof Christianity to the deeper parts of our human mental structure\nis shown by its wildfire contagiousness when it was a new and\nquickening thing.",
        "Faith that Christ has genuinely done his work was part of \nwhat Luther meant by faith, which so far is faith in a fact\nintellectually conceived of.  But this is only one part of\nLuther’s faith, the other part being far more vital.  This other\npart is something not intellectual but immediate and intuitive,\nthe assurance, namely, that I, this individual I, just as I\nstand, without one plea, etc., am saved now and forever. [132]\nProfessor Leuba is undoubtedly right in contending that the\nconceptual belief about Christ’s work, although so often\nefficacious and antecedent, is really accessory and\nnon-essential, and that the “joyous conviction” can also come by\nfar other channels than this conception.  It is to the joyous\nconviction itself, the assurance that all is well with one, that\nhe would give the name of faith par excellence.  “When the sense\nof estrangement,” he writes, “fencing man about in a narrowly\nlimited ego, breaks down, the individual finds himself ’at one\nwith all creation.’ He lives in the universal life; he and man,\nhe and nature, he and God, are one.  That state of confidence,\ntrust, union with all things, following upon the achievement of\nmoral unity, is the Faith-state.  Various dogmatic beliefs\nsuddenly, on the advent of the faith-state, acquire a character\nof certainty, assume a new reality, become an object of faith. \nAs the ground of assurance here is not rational, argumentation is\nirrelevant.  But such conviction being a mere casual offshoot of\nthe faith-state, it is a gross error to imagine that the chief\npractical value of the faith-state is its power to stamp with the\nseal of reality certain particular theological conceptions.[133]\nOn the contrary, its value lies solely in the fact that it is the\npsychic correlate of a biological growth reducing contending\ndesires to one direction; a growth which expresses itself in new\naffective states and new reactions; in larger, nobler, more\nChrist-like activities.  The ground of the specific assurance in\nreligious dogmas is then an affective experience.  The objects of\nfaith may even be preposterous; the affective stream will float\nthem along, and invest them with unshakable certitude.  The more\nstartling the affective experience, the less explicable it seems,\nthe easier it is to make it the carrier of unsubstantiated\nnotions.\"[134]",
        "[132] In some conversions, both steps are distinct; in this one,\nfor example:–",
        "“Whilst I was reading the evangelical treatise, I was soon struck\nby an expression:  ’the finished work of Christ.’ ’Why,’ I asked\nof myself, ’does the author use these terms?  Why does he not say\n\"the atoning work”?’ Then these words, ’It is finished,’\npresented themselves to my mind.  ’What is it that is finished?’\nI asked, and in an instant my mind replied:  ’A perfect expiation\nfor sin; entire satisfaction has been given; the debt has been\npaid by the Substitute. Christ has died for our sins; not for\nours only, but for those of all men.  If, then, the entire work\nis finished, all the debt paid, what remains for me to do?’ In\nanother instant the light was shed through my mind by the Holy\nGhost, and the joyous conviction was given me that nothing more\nwas to be done, save to fall on my knees, to accept this Saviour\nand his love, to praise God forever.”  Autobiography of Hudson\nTaylor.  I translate back into English from the French\ntranslation of Challand (Geneva, no date), the original not being\naccessible.",
        "[133] Tolstoy’s case was a good comment on those words.  There\nwas almost no theology in his conversion.  His faith-state was\nthe sense come back that life was infinite in its moral\nsignificance.",
        "[134] American Journal of Psychology, vii. 345-347, abridged.",
        "The characteristics of the affective experience which, to avoid\nambiguity, should, I think, be called the state of assurance\nrather than the faith-state, can be easily enumerated, though it\nis probably difficult to realize their intensity, unless one has\nbeen through the experience one’s self.",
        "The central one is the loss of all the worry, the sense that all\nis ultimately well with one, the peace, the harmony, the\nWILLINGNESS TO BE, even though the outer conditions should remain\nthe same.  The certainty of God’s “grace,” of “justification,\"\n\"salvation,” is an objective belief that usually accompanies the\nchange in Christians; but this may be entirely lacking and yet\nthe affective peace remain the same–you will recollect the case\nof the Oxford graduate:  and many might be given where the\nassurance of personal salvation <243> was only a later result. \nA passion of willingness, of acquiescence, of admiration, is the\nglowing centre of this state of mind.",
        "The second feature is the sense of perceiving truths not known\nbefore.  The mysteries of life become lucid, as Professor Leuba\nsays; and often, nay usually, the solution is more or less\nunutterable in words.  But these more intellectual phenomena may\nbe postponed until we treat of mysticism.",
        "A third peculiarity of the assurance state is the objective\nchange which the world often appears to undergo.  “An appearance\nof newness beautifies every object,” the precise opposite of that\nother sort of newness, that dreadful unreality and strangeness in\nthe appearance of the world, which is experienced by melancholy\npatients, and of which you may recall my relating some\nexamples.[135] This sense of clean and beautiful newness within\nand without is one of the commonest entries in conversion\nrecords. Jonathan Edwards thus describes it in himself:–",
        "[135] Above, p. 150.",
        "“After this my sense of divine things gradually increased, and\nbecame more and more lively, and had more of that inward\nsweetness.  The appearance of everything was altered; there\nseemed to be, as it were, a calm, sweet cast, or appearance of\ndivine glory, in almost everything.  God’s excellency, his\nwisdom, his purity and love, seemed to appear in everything; in\nthe sun, moon, and stars; in the clouds and blue sky; in the\ngrass, flowers, and trees; in the water and all nature; which\nused greatly to fix my mind.  And scarce anything, among all the\nworks of nature, was so sweet to me as thunder and lightning;\nformerly nothing had been so terrible to me.  Before, I used to\nbe uncommonly terrified with thunder, and to be struck with\nterror when I saw a thunderstorm rising; but now, on the\ncontrary, it rejoices me.\"[136]",
        "[136] Dwight:  Life of Edwards, New York, 1830, p. 61, abridged.",
        "<244> Billy Bray, an excellent little illiterate English\nevangelist, records his sense of newness thus:–",
        "“I said to the Lord:  ’Thou hast said, they that ask shall\nreceive, they that seek shall find, and to them that knock the\ndoor shall be opened, and I have faith to believe it.’ In an\ninstant the Lord made me so happy that I cannot express what I\nfelt.  I shouted for joy.  I praised God with my whole heart. . .\n. I think this was in November, 1823, but what day of the month\nI do not know.  I remember this, that everything looked new to\nme, the people, the fields, the cattle, the trees.  I was like a\nnew man in a new world.  I spent the greater part of my time in\npraising the Lord.\"[137]",
        "[137] W. F. Bourne:  The King’s Son, a Memoir of Billy Bray,\nLondon, Hamilton, Adams & Co., 1887, p. 9.",
        "Starbuck and Leuba both illustrate this sense of newness by\nquotations.  I take the two following from Starbuck’s manuscript\ncollection.  One, a woman, says:–",
        "“I was taken to a camp-meeting, mother and religious friends\nseeking and praying for my conversion.  My emotional nature was\nstirred to its depths; confessions of depravity and pleading with\nGod for salvation from sin made me oblivious of all surroundings.\nI plead for mercy, and had a vivid realization of forgiveness and\nrenewal of my nature.  When rising from my knees I exclaimed,\n’Old things have passed away, all things have become new.’ It was\nlike entering another world, a new state of existence.  Natural\nobjects were glorified, my spiritual vision was so clarified that\nI saw beauty in every material object in the universe, the woods\nwere vocal with heavenly music; my soul exulted in the love of\nGod, and I wanted everybody to share in my joy.”",
        "The next case is that of a man:–",
        "“I know not how I got back into the encampment, but found myself\nstaggering up to Rev. ––’s Holiness tent–and as it was full of\nseekers and a terrible noise inside, some groaning, some\nlaughing, and some shouting, and by a large oak, ten feet from\nthe tent, I fell on my face by a bench, and tried to pray, and\nevery time I would call on God, something like a man’s hand would\nstrangle me by choking.  I don’t know whether there were any one\naround or near me or not.  I thought I should surely die if I did\nnot get help, but just as often as I would pray, that unseen hand\nwas felt on my throat and my breath squeezed off. Finally\nsomething said:  ’Venture on the atonement, for you will die\nanyway if you don’t.’  So I made one final struggle to call on\nGod for mercy, with the same choking and strangling, determined\nto finish the sentence of prayer for Mercy, if I did strangle and\ndie, and the last I remember that time was falling back on the\nground with the same unseen hand on my throat.  I don’t know how\nlong I lay there or what was going on.  None of my folks were\npresent.  When I came to myself, there were a crowd around me\npraising God.  The very heavens seemed to open and pour down rays\nof light and glory.  Not for a moment only, but all day and\nnight, floods of light and glory seemed to pour through my soul,\nand oh, how I was changed, and everything became new.  My horses\nand hogs and even everybody seemed changed.”",
        "This man’s case introduces the feature of automatisms, which in\nsuggestible subjects have been so startling a feature at revivals\nsince, in Edwards’s, Wesley’s and Whitfield’s time, these became\na regular means of gospel-propagation.  They were at first\nsupposed to be semi-miraculous proofs of “power” on the part of\nthe Holy Ghost; but great divergence of opinion quickly arose\nconcerning them.  Edwards, in his Thoughts on the Revival of\nReligion in New England, has to defend them against their\ncritics; and their value has long been matter of debate even\nwithin the revivalistic denominations.[138] They undoubtedly have\nno essential spiritual significance, and although their presence\nmakes his conversion more memorable to the convert, it has never\nbeen proved that converts who show them are more persevering or\nfertile in good fruits than those whose change of heart has had\nless violent accompaniments.  On the whole, unconsciousness,\nconvulsions, visions, involuntary vocal utterances, and\nsuffocation, must be simply ascribed to the subject’s having a\nlarge subliminal region, involving nervous instability. This is\noften the subject’s own view of the matter afterwards.  One of\nStarbuck’s correspondents writes, for instance:–",
        "[138] Consult William B. Sprague:  Lectures on Revivals of\nReligion, New York, 1832, in the long Appendix to which the\nopinions of a large number of ministers are given.",
        "“I have been through the experience which is known as conversion.\nMy explanation of it is this:  the subject works his emotions up\nto the breaking point, at the same time resisting their physical\nmanifestations, such as quickened pulse, etc., and then suddenly\nlets them have their full sway over his body.  The relief is\nsomething wonderful, and the pleasurable effects of the emotions\nare experienced to the highest degree.”",
        "There is one form of sensory automatism which possibly deserves\nspecial notice on account of its frequency.  I refer to\nhallucinatory or pseudo-hallucinatory luminous phenomena,\nphotisms, to use the term of the psychologists.  Saint Paul’s\nblinding heavenly vision seems to have been a phenomenon of this\nsort; so does Constantine’s cross in the sky.  The last case but\none which I quoted mentions floods of light and glory.  Henry\nAlline mentions a light, about whose externality he seems\nuncertain.  Colonel Gardiner sees a blazing light.  President\nFinney writes:–",
        "“All at once the glory of God shone upon and round about me in a\nmanner almost marvelous. . . . A light perfectly ineffable shone\nin my soul, that almost prostrated me on the ground. . . . This\nlight seemed like the brightness of the sun in every direction. \nIt was too intense for the eyes. . . . I think I knew something\nthen, by actual experience, of that light that prostrated Paul on\nthe way to Damascus.  It was surely a light such as I could not\nhave endured long.\"[139]",
        "[139] Memoirs, p. 34",
        "Such reports of photisms are indeed far from uncommon. Here is\nanother from Starbuck’s collection, where the light appeared\nevidently external:–",
        "“I had attended a series of revival services for about two weeks\noff and on.  Had been invited to the altar several times, all the\ntime becoming more deeply impressed, when finally I decided I\nmust do this, or I should be lost.  Realization of conversion was\nvery vivid, like a ton’s weight being lifted from my heart; a\nstrange light which seemed to light up the whole room (for it was\ndark); a conscious supreme bliss which caused me to repeat ’Glory\nto God’ for a long time.  Decided to be God’s child for life, and\nto give up my pet ambition, wealth and social position.  My\nformer habits of life hindered my growth somewhat, but I set\nabout overcoming these systematically, and in one year my whole\nnature was changed, i. e., my ambitions were of a different\norder.”",
        "Here is another one of Starbuck’s cases, involving a luminous\nelement:–",
        "“I had been clearly converted twenty-three years before, or\nrather reclaimed.  My experience in regeneration was then clear\nand spiritual, and I had not backslidden.  But I experienced\nentire sanctification on the 15th day of March, 1893, about\neleven o’clock in the morning.  The particular accompaniments of\nthe experience were entirely unexpected.  I was quietly sitting\nat home singing selections out of Pentecostal Hymns.  Suddenly\nthere seemed to be a something sweeping into me and inflating my\nentire being–such a sensation as I had never experienced before.",
        "When this experience came, I seemed to be conducted around a\nlarge, capacious, well-lighted room.  As I walked with my\ninvisible conductor and looked around, a clear thought was coined\nin my mind, ’They are not here, they are gone.’  As soon as the\nthought was definitely formed in my mind, though no word was\nspoken, the Holy Spirit impressed me that I was surveying my\nown soul.  Then, for the first time in all my life, did I know\nthat I was cleansed from all sin, and filled with the fullness of\nGod.”",
        "Leuba quotes the case of a Mr. Peek, where the luminous affection\nreminds one of the chromatic hallucinations produced by the\nintoxicant cactus buds called mescal by the Mexicans:–",
        "“When I went in the morning into the fields to work, the glory of\nGod appeared in all his visible creation.  I well remember we\nreaped oats, and how every straw and head of the oats seemed, as\nit were, arrayed in a kind of rainbow glory, or to glow, if I may\nso express it, in the glory of God.\"[140]",
        "[140] These reports of sensorial photism shade off into what are\nevidently only metaphorical accounts of the sense of new\nspiritual illumination, as, for instance, in Brainerd’s\nstatement:  “As I was walking in a thick grove, unspeakable glory\nseemed to open to the apprehension of my soul.  I do not mean any\nexternal brightness, for I saw no such thing, nor any imagination\nof a body of light in the third heavens, or anything of that\nnature, but it was a new inward apprehension or view that I had\nof God.”",
        "In a case like this next one from Starbuck’s manuscript\ncollection the lighting up of the darkness is probably also\nmetaphorical:–",
        "“One Sunday night, I resolved that when I got home to the ranch\nwhere I was working, I would offer myself with my faculties and\nall to God to be used only by and for him. . . .  It was raining\nand the roads were muddy; but this desire grew so strong that I\nkneeled down by the side of the road and told God all about it,\nintending then to get up and go on.  Such a thing as any special\nanswer to my prayer never entered my mind, having been converted\nby faith, but still being most undoubtedly saved.  Well, while I\nwas praying, I remember holding out my hands to God and telling\nhim they should work for him, my feet walk for him, my tongue\nspeak for him, etc., etc., if he would only use me as his\ninstrument and give me a satisfying experience–when suddenly the\ndarkness of the night seemed lit up–I felt, realized, knew, that\nGod heard and answered my prayer. Deep happiness came over me; I\nfelt I was accepted into the inner circle of God’s loved ones.”",
        "In the following case also the flash of light is metaphorical:–",
        "“A prayer meeting had been called for at close of evening\nservice. The minister supposed me impressed by his discourse (a\nmistake–he was dull).  He came and, placing his hand upon my\nshoulder, said:  ’Do you not want to give your heart to God?’  I\nreplied in the affirmative.  Then said he, ’Come to the front\nseat.’  They sang and prayed and talked with me.  I experienced\nnothing but unaccountable wretchedness. They declared that the\nreason why I did not ’obtain peace’ was because I was not willing\nto give up all to God.  After about two hours the minister said\nwe would go home.  As usual, on retiring, I prayed.  In great\ndistress, I at this time simply said, ’Lord, I have done all I\ncan, I leave the whole matter with thee.’  Immediately, like a\nflash of light, there came to me a great peace, and I arose and\nwent into my parents’ bedroom and said, ’I do feel so wonderfully\nhappy.’  This I regard as the hour of conversion.  It was the\nhour in which I became assured of divine acceptance and favor. \nSo far as my life was concerned, it made little immediate\nchange.”",
        "The most characteristic of all the elements of the conversion\ncrisis, and the last one of which I shall speak, is the ecstasy\nof happiness produced.  We have already heard several accounts of\nit, but I will add a couple more.  President Finney’s is so vivid\nthat I give it at length:–",
        "“All my feelings seemed to rise and flow out; and the utterance\nof my heart was, ’I want to pour my whole soul out to God.’ The\nrising of my soul was so great that I rushed into the back room\nof the front office, to pray.  There was no fire and no light in\nthe room; nevertheless it appeared to me as if it were perfectly\nlight.  As I went in and shut the door after me, it seemed as if\nI met the Lord Jesus Christ face to face.  It did not occur to me\nthen, nor did it for some time afterwards, that it was wholly a\nmental state.  On the contrary, it seemed to me that I saw him as\nI would see any other man.  He said nothing but looked at me in\nsuch a manner as to break me right down at his feet.  I have\nalways since regarded this as a most remarkable state of mind;\nfor it seemed to me a reality that he stood before me, and I fell\ndown at his feet and poured out my soul to him.  I wept aloud\nlike a child, and made such confessions as I could with my choked\nutterance.  It seemed to me that I bathed his feet with my tears;\nand yet I had no distinct impression that I touched him, that I\nrecollect.  I must have continued in this state for a good while,\nbut my mind was too absorbed with the interview to recollect\nanything that I said.  But I know, as soon as my mind became calm\nenough to break off from the interview, I returned to the front\noffice, and found that the fire that I had made of large wood was\nnearly burned out.  But as I turned and was about to take a seat\nby the fire, I received a mighty baptism of the Holy Ghost. \nWithout any expectation of it, without ever having the thought in\nmy mind that there was any such thing for me, without any\nrecollection that I had ever heard the thing mentioned by any\nperson in the world, the Holy Spirit descended upon me in a\nmanner that seemed to go through me, body and soul.  I could feel\nthe impression, like a wave of electricity, going through and\nthrough me.  Indeed, it seemed to come in waves and waves of\nliquid love; for I could not express it in any other way.  It\nseemed like the very breath of God.  I can recollect distinctly\nthat it seemed to fan me, like immense wings.",
        "“No words can express the wonderful love that was shed abroad in\nmy heart.  I wept aloud with joy and love; and I do not know but\nI should say I literally bellowed out the unutterable gushings of\nmy heart.  These waves came over me, and over me, and over me,\none after the other, until I recollect I cried out, ’I shall die\nif these waves continue to pass over me.’  I said, ’Lord, I\ncannot bear any more;’ yet I had no fear of death.",
        "“How long I continued in this state, with this baptism continuing\nto roll over me and go through me, I do not know.  But I know it\nwas late in the evening when a member of my choir –for I was the\nleader of the choir–came into the office to see me.  He was a\nmember of the church.  He found me in this state of loud weeping,\nand said to me, ’Mr. Finney, what ails you?’  I could make him no\nanswer for some time.  He then said, ’Are you in pain?’ I\ngathered myself up as best I could, and replied, ’No, but so\nhappy that I cannot live.’”",
        "I just now quoted Billy Bray; I cannot do better than give his\nown brief account of his post-conversion feelings:–",
        "“I can’t help praising the Lord.  As I go along the street, I\nlift up one foot, and it seems to say ’Glory’; and I lift up the\nother, and it seems to say ’Amen’; and so they keep up like that\nall the time I am walking.\"[141]",
        "[141] I add in a note a few more records:–",
        "“One morning, being in deep distress, fearing every moment I\nshould drop into hell, I was constrained to cry in earnest for\nmercy, and the Lord came to my relief, and delivered my soul from\nthe burden and guilt of sin.  My whole frame was in a tremor from\nhead to foot, and my soul enjoyed sweet peace.  The pleasure I\nthen felt was indescribable.  The happiness lasted about three\ndays, during which time I never spoke to any person about my\nfeelings.”  Autobiography of Dan Young, edited by W. P.\nStrickland, New York, 1860.",
        "“In an instant there rose up in me such a sense of God’s taking\ncare of those who put their trust in him that for an hour all the\nworld was crystalline, the heavens were lucid, and I sprang to my\nfeet and began to cry and laugh.”  H. W. Beecher, quoted by\nLeuba.",
        "“My tears of sorrow changed to joy, and I lay there praising God\nin such ecstasy of joy as only the soul who experiences it can\nrealize.” –\"I cannot express how I felt.  It was as if I had\nbeen in a dark dungeon and lifted into the light of the sun.  I\nshouted and I sang praise unto him who loved me and washed me\nfrom my sins.  I was forced to retire into a secret place, for\nthe tears did flow, and I did not wish my shopmates to see me,\nand yet I could not keep it a secret.\"–\"I experienced joy almost\nto weeping.\"–\"I felt my face must have shone like that of Moses.",
        "I had a general feeling of buoyancy.  It was the greatest joy it\nwas ever my lot to experience.\"–\"I wept and laughed alternately.",
        "I was as light as if walking on air.  I felt as if I had gained\ngreater peace and happiness than I had ever expected to\nexperience.” Starbuck’s correspondents.",
        "One word, before I close this lecture, on the question of the\ntransiency or permanence of these abrupt conversions. Some of\nyou, I feel sure, knowing that numerous backslidings and relapses\ntake place, make of these their apperceiving mass for\ninterpreting the whole subject, and dismiss it with a pitying\nsmile at so much “hysterics.”  Psychologically, as well as\nreligiously, however, this is shallow.  It misses the point of\nserious interest, which is not so much the duration as the nature\nand quality of these shiftings of character to higher levels. \nMen lapse from every level–we need no statistics to tell us\nthat.  Love is, for instance, well known not to be irrevocable,\nyet, constant or inconstant, it reveals new flights and reaches\nof ideality while it lasts.  These revelations form its\nsignificance to men and women, whatever be its duration.  So\nwith the conversion experience:  that it should for even a short\ntime show a human being what the high- water mark of his\nspiritual capacity is, this is what constitutes its\nimportance–an importance which backsliding cannot diminish,\nalthough persistence might increase it.  As a matter of fact, all\nthe more striking instances of conversion, all those, for\ninstance, which I have quoted, HAVE been permanent.  The case of\nwhich there might be most doubt, on account of its suggesting so\nstrongly an epileptoid seizure, was the case of M. Ratisbonne. \nYet I am informed that Ratisbonne’s whole future was shaped by\nthose few minutes. He gave up his project of marriage, became a\npriest, founded at Jerusalem, where he went to dwell, a mission\nof nuns for the conversion of the Jews, showed no tendency to use\nfor egotistic purposes the notoriety given him by the peculiar\ncircumstances of his conversion–which, for the rest, he could\nseldom refer to without tears–and in short remained an exemplary\nson of the Church until he died, late in the 80’s, if I remember\nrightly.",
        "The only statistics I know of, on the subject of the duration of\nconversions, are those collected for Professor Starbuck by Miss\nJohnston.  They embrace only a hundred persons, evangelical\nchurch-members, more than half being Methodists.  According to\nthe statement of the subjects themselves, there had been\nbacksliding of some sort in nearly all the cases, 93 per cent. of\nthe women, 77 per cent. of the men.  Discussing the returns more\nminutely, Starbuck finds that only 6 per cent. are relapses from\nthe religious faith which the conversion confirmed, and that the\nbacksliding complained of is in most only a fluctuation in the\nardor of sentiment.  Only six of the hundred cases report a\nchange of faith.  Starbuck’s conclusion is that the effect of\nconversion is to bring with it “a changed attitude towards life,\nwhich is fairly constant and permanent, although the feelings\nfluctuate. . . . In other words, the persons who have passed\nthrough conversion, having once taken a stand for the religious\nlife, tend to feel themselves identified with it, no matter how\nmuch their religious enthusiasm declines.\"[142]",
