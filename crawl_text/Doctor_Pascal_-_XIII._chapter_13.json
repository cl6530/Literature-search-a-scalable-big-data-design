        "It was not until after breakfast, at about one o’clock, that Clotilde\nreceived the despatch. On this day it had chanced that she had\nquarreled with her brother Maxime, who, taking advantage of his\nprivileges as an invalid, had tormented her more and more every day by\nhis unreasonable caprices and his outbursts of ill temper. In short,\nher visit to him had not proved a success. He found that she was too\nsimple and too serious to cheer him; and he had preferred, of late,\nthe society of Rose, the fair-haired young girl, with the innocent\nlook, who amused him. So that when his sister told him that their\nuncle had sent for her, and that she was going away, he gave his\napproval at once, and although he asked her to return as soon as she\nshould have settled her affairs at home, he did so only with the\ndesire of showing himself amiable, and he did not press the\ninvitation.",
        "Clotilde spent the afternoon in packing her trunks. In the feverish\nexcitement of so sudden a decision she had thought of nothing but the\njoy of her return. But after the hurry of dinner was over, after she\nhad said good-by to her brother, after the interminable drive in a\nhackney coach along the avenue of the Bois de Boulogne to the Lyons\nrailway station, when she found herself in the ladies’ compartment,\nstarting on the long journey on a cold and rainy November night,\nalready rolling away from Paris, her excitement began to abate, and\nreflections forced their way into her mind and began to trouble her.\nWhy this brief and urgent despatch: “I await you; start this evening.\"\nDoubtless it was the answer to her letter; but she knew how greatly\nPascal had desired that she should remain in Paris, where he thought\nshe was happy, and she was astonished at his hasty summons. She had\nnot expected a despatch, but a letter, arranging for her return a few\nweeks later. There must be something else, then; perhaps he was ill\nand felt a desire, a longing to see her again at once. And from this\ntime forward this fear seized her with the force of a presentiment,\nand grew stronger and stronger, until it soon took complete possession\nof her.",
        "All night long the rain beat furiously against the windows of the\ntrain while they were crossing the plains of Burgundy, and did not\ncease until they reached Macon. When they had passed Lyons the day\nbroke. Clotilde had Pascal’s letters with her, and she had waited\nimpatiently for the daylight that she might read again carefully these\nletters, the writing of which had seemed changed to her. And noticing\nthe unsteady characters, the breaks in the words, she felt a chill at\nher heart. He was ill, very ill–she had become certain of this now,\nby a divination in which there was less of reasoning than of subtle\nprescience. And the rest of the journey seemed terribly long, for her\nanguish increased in proportion as she approached its termination. And\nworse than all, arriving at Marseilles at half-past twelve, there was\nno train for Plassans until twenty minutes past three. Three long\nhours of waiting! She breakfasted at the buffet in the railway\nstation, eating hurriedly, as if she was afraid of missing this train;\nthen she dragged herself into the dusty garden, going from bench to\nbench in the pale, mild sunshine, among omnibuses and hackney coaches.\nAt last she was once more in the train, which stopped at every little\nway station. When they were approaching Plassans she put her head out\nof the window eagerly, longing to see the town again after her short\nabsence of two months. It seemed to her as if she had been away for\ntwenty years, and that everything must be changed. When the train was\nleaving the little station of Sainte-Marthe her emotion reached its\nheight when, leaning out, she saw in the distance La Souleiade with\nthe two secular cypresses on the terrace, which could be seen three\nleagues off.",
        "It was five o’clock, and twilight was already falling. The train\nstopped, and Clotilde descended. But it was a surprise and a keen\ngrief to her not to see Pascal waiting for her on the platform. She\nhad been saying to herself since they had left Lyons: “If I do not see\nhim at once, on the arrival of the train, it will be because he is\nill.” He might be in the waiting-room, however, or with a carriage\noutside. She hurried forward, but she saw no one but Father Durieu, a\ndriver whom the doctor was in the habit of employing. She questioned\nhim eagerly. The old man, a taciturn Provencal, was in no haste to\nanswer. His wagon was there, and he asked her for the checks for her\nluggage, wishing to see about the trunks before anything else. In a\ntrembling voice she repeated her question:",
        "“Is everybody well, Father Durieu?”",
        "“Yes, mademoiselle.”",
        "And she was obliged to put question after question to him before she\nsucceeded in eliciting the information that it was Martine who had\ntold him, at about six o’clock the day before, to be at the station\nwith his wagon, in time to meet the train. He had not seen the doctor,\nno one had seen him, for two months past. It might very well be since\nhe was not here that he had been obliged to take to his bed, for there\nwas a report in the town that he was not very well.",
        "“Wait until I get the luggage, mademoiselle,” he ended, “there is room\nfor you on the seat.”",
        "“No, Father Durieu, it would be too long to wait. I will walk.”",
        "She ascended the slope rapidly. Her heart was so tightened that she\ncould scarcely breathe. The sun had sunk behind the hills of\nSainte-Marthe, and a fine mist was falling from the chill gray November\nsky, and as she took the road to Les Fenouilleres she caught another\nglimpse of La Souleiade, which struck a chill to her heart–the front of\nthe house, with all its shutters closed, and wearing a look of\nabandonment and desolation in the melancholy twilight.",
        "But Clotilde received the final and terrible blow when she saw Ramond\nstanding at the hall door, apparently waiting for her. He had indeed\nbeen watching for her, and had come downstairs to break the dreadful\nnews gently to her. She arrived out of breath; she had crossed the\nquincunx of plane trees near the fountain to shorten the way, and on\nseeing the young man there instead of Pascal, whom she had in spite of\neverything expected to see, she had a presentiment of overwhelming\nruin, of irreparable misfortune. Ramond was pale and agitated,\nnotwithstanding the effort he made to control his feelings. At the\nfirst moment he could not find a word to say, but waited to be\nquestioned. Clotilde, who was herself suffocating, said nothing. And\nthey entered the house thus; he led her to the dining-room, where they\nremained for a few seconds, face to face, in mute anguish.",
        "“He is ill, is he not?” she at last faltered.",
        "“Yes,” he said, “he is ill.”",
        "“I knew it at once when I saw you,” she replied. “I knew when he was\nnot here that he must be ill. He is very ill, is he not?” she\npersisted.",
        "As he did not answer but grew still paler, she looked at him fixedly.\nAnd on the instant she saw the shadow of death upon him; on his hands\nthat still trembled, that had assisted the dying man; on his sad face;\nin his troubled eyes, which still retained the reflection of the death\nagony; in the neglected and disordered appearance of the physician\nwho, for twelve hours, had maintained an unavailing struggle against\ndeath.",
        "She gave a loud cry:",
        "“He is dead!”",
        "She tottered, and fell fainting into the arms of Ramond, who with a\ngreat sob pressed her in a brotherly embrace. And thus they wept on\neach other’s neck.",
        "When he had seated her in a chair, and she was able to speak, he said:",
        "“It was I who took the despatch you received to the telegraph office\nyesterday, at half-past ten o’clock. He was so happy, so full of hope!\nHe was forming plans for the future–a year, two years of life. And\nthis morning, at four o’clock, he had the first attack, and he sent\nfor me. He saw at once that he was doomed, but he expected to last\nuntil six o’clock, to live long enough to see you again. But the\ndisease progressed too rapidly. He described its progress to me,\nminute by minute, like a professor in the dissecting room. He died\nwith your name upon his lips, calm, but full of anguish, like a hero.”",
        "Clotilde listened, her eyes drowned in tears which flowed endlessly.\nEvery word of the relation of this piteous and stoical death\npenetrated her heart and stamped itself there. She reconstructed every\nhour of the dreadful day. She followed to its close its grand and\nmournful drama. She would live it over in her thoughts forever.",
        "But her despairing grief overflowed when Martine, who had entered the\nroom a moment before, said in a harsh voice:",
        "“Ah, mademoiselle has good reason to cry! for if monsieur is dead,\nmademoiselle is to blame for it.”",
        "The old servant stood apart, near the door of her kitchen, in such a\npassion of angry grief, because they had taken her master from her,\nbecause they had killed him, that she did not even try to find a word\nof welcome or consolation for this child whom she had brought up. And\nwithout calculating the consequences of her indiscretion, the grief or\nthe joy which she might cause, she relieved herself by telling all she\nknew.",
        "“Yes, if monsieur has died, it is because mademoiselle went away.”",
        "From the depths of her overpowering grief Clotilde protested. She had\nexpected to see Martine weeping with her, like Ramond, and she was\nsurprised to feel that she was an enemy.",
        "“Why, it was he who would not let me stay, who insisted upon my going\naway,” she said.",
        "“Oh, well! mademoiselle must have been willing to go or she would have\nbeen more clear-sighted. The night before your departure I found\nmonsieur half-suffocated with grief; and when I wished to inform\nmademoiselle, he himself prevented me; he had such courage. Then I\ncould see it all, after mademoiselle had gone. Every night it was the\nsame thing over again, and he could hardly keep from writing to you to\ncome back. In short, he died of it, that is the pure truth.”",
        "A great light broke in on Clotilde’s mind, making her at the same time\nvery happy and very wretched. Good God! what she had suspected for a\nmoment, was then true. Afterward she had been convinced, seeing\nPascal’s angry persistence, that he was speaking the truth; that\nbetween her and work he had chosen work sincerely, like a man of\nscience with whom love of work has gained the victory over the love of\nwoman. And yet he had not spoken the truth; he had carried his\ndevotion, his self-forgetfulness to the point of immolating himself to\nwhat he believed to be her happiness. And the misery of things willed\nthat he should have been mistaken, that he should have thus\nconsummated the unhappiness of both.",
        "Clotilde again protested wildly:",
        "“But how could I have known? I obeyed; I put all my love in my\nobedience.”",
        "“Ah,” cried Martine again, “it seems to me that I should have\nguessed.”",
        "Ramond interposed gently. He took Clotilde’s hands once more in his,\nand explained to her that grief might indeed have hastened the fatal\nissue, but that the master had unhappily been doomed for some time\npast. The affection of the heart from which he had suffered must have\nbeen of long standing–a great deal of overwork, a certain part of\nheredity, and, finally, his late absorbing love, and the poor heart\nhad broken.",
        "“Let us go upstairs,” said Clotilde simply. “I wish to see him.”",
        "Upstairs in the death-chamber the blinds were closed, shutting out\neven the melancholy twilight. On a little table at the foot of the bed\nburned two tapers in two candlesticks. And they cast a pale yellow\nlight on Pascal’s form extended on the bed, the feet close together,\nthe hands folded on the breast. The eyes had been piously closed. The\nface, of a bluish hue still, but already looking calm and peaceful,\nframed by the flowing white hair and beard, seemed asleep. He had been\ndead scarcely an hour and a half, yet already infinite serenity,\neternal silence, eternal repose, had begun.",
        "Seeing him thus, at the thought that he no longer heard her, that he\nno longer saw her, that she was alone now, that she was to kiss him\nfor the last time, and then lose him forever, Clotilde, in an outburst\nof grief, threw herself upon the bed, and in broken accents of\npassionate tenderness cried:",
        "“Oh, master, master, master–”",
        "She pressed her lips to the dead man’s forehead, and, feeling it still\nwarm with life, she had a momentary illusion: she fancied that he felt\nthis last caress, so cruelly awaited. Did he not smile in his\nimmobility, happy at last, and able to die, now that he felt her here\nbeside him? Then, overcome by the dreadful reality, she burst again\ninto wild sobs.",
        "Martine entered, bringing a lamp, which she placed on a corner of the\nchimney-piece, and she heard Ramond, who was watching Clotilde,\ndisquieted at seeing her passionate grief, say:",
        "“I shall take you away from the room if you give way like this.\nConsider that you have some one else to think of now.”",
        "The servant had been surprised at certain words which she had\noverheard by chance during the day. Suddenly she understood, and she\nturned paler even than before, and on her way out of the room, she\nstopped at the door to hear more.",
        "“The key of the press is under his pillow,” said Ramond, lowering his\nvoice; “he told me repeatedly to tell you so. You know what you have\nto do?”",
        "Clotilde made an effort to remember and to answer.",
        "“What I have to do? About the papers, is it not? Yes, yes, I remember;\nI am to keep the envelopes and to give you the other manuscripts. Have\nno fear, I am quite calm, I will be very reasonable. But I will not\nleave him; I will spend the night here very quietly, I promise you.”",
        "She was so unhappy, she seemed so resolved to watch by him, to remain\nwith him, until he should be taken away, that the young physician\nallowed her to have her way.",
        "“Well, I will leave you now. They will be expecting me at home. Then\nthere are all sorts of formalities to be gone through–to give notice\nat the mayor’s office, the funeral, of which I wish to spare you the\ndetails. Trouble yourself about nothing. Everything will be arranged\nto-morrow when I return.”",
        "He embraced her once more and then went away. And it was only then\nthat Martine left the room, behind him, and locking the hall door she\nran out into the darkness.",
        "Clotilde was now alone in the chamber; and all around and about her,\nin the unbroken silence, she felt the emptiness of the house. Clotilde\nwas alone with the dead Pascal. She placed a chair at the head of the\nbed and sat there motionless, alone. On arriving, she had merely\nremoved her hat: now, perceiving that she still had on her gloves, she\ntook them off also. But she kept on her traveling dress, crumpled and\ndusty, after twenty hours of railway travel. No doubt Father Durieu\nhad brought the trunks long ago, and left them downstairs. But it did\nnot occur to her, nor had she the strength to wash herself and change\nher clothes, but remained sitting, overwhelmed with grief, on the\nchair into which she had dropped. One regret, a great remorse, filled\nher to the exclusion of all else. Why had she obeyed him? Why had she\nconsented to leave him? If she had remained she had the ardent\nconviction that he would not have died. She would have lavished so\nmuch love, so many caresses upon him, that she would have cured him.\nIf one was anxious to keep a beloved being from dying one should\nremain with him and, if necessary, give one’s heart’s blood to keep\nhim alive. It was her own fault if she had lost him, if she could not\nnow with a caress awaken him from his eternal sleep. And she thought\nherself imbecile not to have understood; cowardly, not to have devoted\nherself to him; culpable, and to be forever punished for having gone\naway when plain common sense, in default of feeling, ought to have\nkept her here, bound, as a submissive and affectionate subject, to the\ntask of watching over her king.",
        "The silence had become so complete, so profound, that Clotilde lifted\nher eyes for a moment from Pascal’s face to look around the room. She\nsaw only vague shadows–the two tapers threw two yellow patches on the\nhigh ceiling. At this moment she remembered the letters he had written\nto her, so short, so cold; and she comprehended his heroic sacrifice,\nthe torture it had been to him to silence his heart, desiring to\nimmolate himself to the end. What strength must he not have required\nfor the accomplishment of the plan of happiness, sublime and\ndisastrous, which he had formed for her. He had resolved to pass out\nof her life in order to save her from his old age and his poverty; he\nwished her to be rich and free, to enjoy her youth, far away from him;\nthis indeed was utter self-effacement, complete absorption in the love\nof another. And she felt a profound gratitude, a sweet solace in the\nthought, mingled with a sort of angry bitterness against evil fortune.\nThen, suddenly, the happy years of her childhood and her long youth\nspent beside him who had always been so kind and so good-humored, rose\nbefore her–how he had gradually won her affection, how she had felt\nthat she was his, after the quarrels which had separated them for a\ntime, and with what a transport of joy she had at last given herself\nto him.",
        "Seven o’clock struck. Clotilde started as the clear tones broke the\nprofound silence. Who was it that had spoken? Then she remembered, and\nshe looked at the clock. And when the last sound of the seven strokes,\neach of which had fallen like a knell upon her heart, had died away,\nshe turned her eyes again on the motionless face of Pascal, and once\nmore she abandoned herself to her grief.",
        "It was in the midst of this ever-increasing prostration that Clotilde,\na few minutes later, heard a sudden sound of sobbing. Some one had\nrushed into the room; she looked round and saw her Grandmother\nFelicite. But she did not stir, she did not speak, so benumbed was she\nwith grief. Martine, anticipating the orders which Clotilde would\nundoubtedly have given her, had hurried to old Mme. Rougon’s, to give\nher the dreadful news; and the latter, dazed at first by the\nsuddenness of the catastrophe, and afterward greatly agitated, had\nhurried to the house, overflowing with noisy grief. She burst into\ntears at sight of her son, and then embraced Clotilde, who returned\nher kiss, as in a dream. And from this instant the latter, without\nemerging from the overwhelming grief in which she isolated herself,\nfelt that she was no longer alone, hearing a continual stir and bustle\ngoing on around her. It was Felicite crying, coming in and going out\non tiptoe, setting things in order, spying about, whispering, dropping\ninto a chair, to get up again a moment afterward, after saying that\nshe was going to die in it. At nine o’clock she made a last effort to\npersuade her granddaughter to eat something. Twice already she had\nlectured her in a low voice; she came now again to whisper to her:",
        "“Clotilde, my dear, I assure you you are wrong. You must keep up your\nstrength or you will never be able to hold out.”",
        "But the young woman, with a shake of her head, again refused.",
        "“Come, you breakfasted at the buffet at Marseilles, I suppose, but you\nhave eaten nothing since. Is that reasonable? I do not wish you to\nfall ill also. Martine has some broth. I have told her to make a light\nsoup and to roast a chicken. Go down and eat a mouthful, only a\nmouthful, and I will remain here.”",
        "With the same patient gesture Clotilde again refused. At last she\nfaltered:",
        "“Do not ask me, grandmother, I entreat you. I could not; it would\nchoke me.”",
        "She did not speak again, falling back into her former state of apathy.\nShe did not sleep, however, her wide open eyes were fixed persistently\non Pascal’s face. For hours she sat there, motionless, erect, rigid,\nas if her spirit were far away with the dead. At ten o’clock she heard\na noise; it was Martine bringing up the lamp. Toward eleven Felicite,\nwho was sitting watching in an armchair, seemed to grow restless, got\nup and went out of the room, and came back again. From this forth\nthere was a continual coming and going as of impatient footsteps\nprowling around the young woman, who was still awake, her large eyes\nfixed motionless on Pascal. Twelve o’clock struck, and one persistent\nthought alone pierced her weary brain, like a nail, and prevented\nsleep–why had she obeyed him? If she had remained she would have\nrevived him with her youth, and he would not have died. And it was not\nuntil a little before one that she felt this thought, too, grow\nconfused and lose itself in a nightmare. And she fell into a heavy\nsleep, worn out with grief and fatigue.",
        "When Martine had announced to Mme. Rougon the unexpected death of her\nson Pascal, in the shock which she received there was as much of anger\nas of grief. What! her dying son had not wished to see her; he had\nmade this servant swear not to inform her of his illness! This thought\nsent the blood coursing swiftly through her veins, as if the struggle\nbetween them, which had lasted during his whole life, was to be\ncontinued beyond the grave. Then, when after hastily dressing herself\nshe had hurried to La Souleiade, the thought of the terrible\nenvelopes, of all the manuscripts piled up in the press, had filled\nher with trembling rage. Now that Uncle Macquart and Aunt Dide were\ndead, she no longer feared what she called the abomination of the\nTulettes; and even poor little Charles, in dying, had carried with him\none of the most humiliating of the blots on the family. There remained\nonly the envelopes, the abominable envelopes, to menace the glorious\nRougon legend which she had spent her whole life in creating, which\nwas the sole thought of her old age, the work to the triumph of which\nshe had persistently devoted the last efforts of her wily and active\nbrain. For long years she had watched these envelopes, never wearying,\nbeginning the struggle over again, when he had thought her beaten,\nalways alert and persistent. Ah! if she could only succeed in\nobtaining possession of them and destroying them! It would be the\nexecrable past destroyed, effaced; it would be the glory of her\nfamily, so hardly won, at last freed from all fear, at last shining\nuntarnished, imposing its lie upon history. And she saw herself\ntraversing the three quarters of Plassans, saluted by every one,\nbearing herself as proudly as a queen, mourning nobly for the fallen\nEmpire. So that when Martine informed her that Clotilde had come, she\nquickened her steps as she approached La Souleiade, spurred by the\nfear of arriving too late.",
        "But as soon as she was installed in the house, Felicite at once\nregained her composure. There was no hurry, they had the whole night\nbefore them. She wished, however, to win over Martine without delay,\nand she knew well how to influence this simple creature, bound up in\nthe doctrines of a narrow religion. Going down to the kitchen, then,\nto see the chicken roasting, she began by affecting to be heartbroken\nat the thought of her son dying without having made his peace with the\nChurch. She questioned the servant, pressing her for particulars. But\nthe latter shook her head disconsolately–no, no priest had come,\nmonsieur had not even made the sign of the cross. She, only, had knelt\ndown to say the prayers for the dying, which certainly could not be\nenough for the salvation of a soul. And yet with what fervor she had\nprayed to the good God that monsieur might go straight to Paradise!",
        "With her eyes fixed on the chicken turning on the spit, before a\nbright fire, Felicite resumed in a lower voice, with an absorbed air:",
        "“Ah, my poor girl, what will most prevent him from going to Paradise\nare the abominable papers which the unhappy man has left behind him up\nthere in the press. I cannot understand why it is that lightning from\nheaven has not struck those papers before this and reduced them to\nashes. If they are allowed to leave this house it will be ruin and\ndisgrace and eternal perdition!”",
        "Martine listened, very pale.",
        "“Then madame thinks it would be a good work to destroy them, a work\nthat would assure the repose of monsieur’s soul?”",
        "“Great God! Do I believe it! Why, if I had those dreadful papers in my\nhands, I would throw every one of them into the fire. Oh, you would\nnot need then to put on any more sticks; with the manuscripts upstairs\nalone you would have fuel enough to roast three chickens like that.”",
        "The servant took a long spoon and began to baste the fowl. She, too,\nseemed now to reflect.",
        "“Only we haven’t got them. I even overheard some words on the subject,\nwhich I may repeat to madame. It was when mademoiselle went upstairs.\nDr. Raymond spoke to her about the papers, asking her if she\nremembered some orders which she had received, before she went away,\nno doubt; and she answered that she remembered, that she was to keep\nthe envelopes and to give him all the other manuscripts.”",
        "Felicite trembled; she could not restrain a terrified movement.\nAlready she saw the papers slipping out of her reach; and it was not\nthe envelopes only which she desired, but all the manuscripts, all\nthat unknown, suspicious, and secret work, from which nothing but\nscandal could come, according to the obtuse and excitable mind of the\nproud old bourgeoise.",
        "“But we must act!” she cried, “act immediately, this very night!\nTo-morrow it may be too late.”",
        "“I know where the key of the press is,” answered Martine in a low\nvoice. “The doctor told mademoiselle.”",
        "Felicite immediately pricked up her ears.",
        "“The key; where is it?”",
        "“Under the pillow, under monsieur’s head.”",
        "In spite of the bright blaze of the fire of vine branches the air\nseemed to grow suddenly chill, and the two old women were silent. The\nonly sound to be heard was the drip of the chicken juice falling into\nthe pan.",
        "But after Mme. Rougon had eaten a hasty and solitary dinner she went\nupstairs again with Martine. Without another word being spoken they\nunderstood each other, it was decided that they would use all possible\nmeans to obtain possession of the papers before daybreak. The simplest\nwas to take the key from under the pillow. Clotilde would no doubt at\nlast fall asleep–she seemed too exhausted not to succumb to fatigue.\nAll they had to do was to wait. They set themselves to watch, then,\ngoing back and forth on tiptoe between the study and the bedroom,\nwaiting for the moment when the young woman’s large motionless eyes\nshould close in sleep. One of them would go to see, while the other\nwaited impatiently in the study, where a lamp burned dully on the\ntable. This was repeated every fifteen minutes until midnight. The\nfathomless eyes, full of gloom and of an immense despair, did not\nclose. A little before midnight Felicite installed herself in an\narmchair at the foot of the bed, resolved not to leave the spot until\nher granddaughter should have fallen asleep. From this forth she did\nnot take her eyes off Clotilde, and it filled her with a sort of fear\nto remark that the girl scarcely moved her eyelids, looking with that\ninconsolable fixity which defies sleep. Then she herself began to feel\nsleep stealing over her. Exasperated, trembling with nervous\nimpatience, she could remain where she was no longer. And she went to\nrejoin the servant, who was watching in the study.",
        "“It is useless; she will not sleep,” she said in a stifled and\ntrembling voice. “We must find some other way.”",
        "It had indeed occurred to her to break open the press.",
        "But the old oaken boards were strong, the old iron held firmly. How\ncould they break the lock–not to speak of the noise they would make\nand which would certainly be heard in the adjoining room?",
        "She stood before the thick doors, however, and felt them with her\nfingers, seeking some weak spot.",
        "“If I only had an instrument,” she said.",
        "Martine, less eager, interrupted her, objecting: “Oh, no, no, madame!\nWe might be surprised! Wait, I will go again and see if mademoiselle\nis asleep now.”",
        "She went to the bedroom on tiptoe and returned immediately, saying:",
        "“Yes, she is asleep. Her eyes are closed, and she does not stir.”",
        "Then both went to look at her, holding their breath and walking with\nthe utmost caution, so that the boards might not creak. Clotilde had\nindeed just fallen asleep: and her stupor seemed so profound that the\ntwo old women grew bold. They feared, however, that they might touch\nand waken her, for her chair stood close beside the bed. And then, to\nput one’s hand under a dead man’s pillow to rob him was a terrible and\nsacrilegious act, the thought of which filled them with terror. Might\nit not disturb his repose? Might he not move at the shock? The thought\nmade them turn pale.",
        "Felicite had advanced with outstretched hand, but she drew back,\nstammering:",
        "“I am too short. You try, Martine.”",
        "The servant in her turn approached the bed. But she was seized with\nsuch a fit of trembling that she was obliged to retreat lest she\nshould fall.",
        "“No, no, I cannot!” she said. “It seems to me that monsieur is going\nto open his eyes.”",
        "And trembling and awe-struck they remained an instant longer in the\nlugubrious chamber full of the silence and the majesty of death,\nfacing Pascal, motionless forever, and Clotilde, overwhelmed by the\ngrief of her widowhood. Perhaps they saw, glorifying that mute head,\nguarding its work with all its weight, the nobility of a life spent in\nhonorable labor. The flame of the tapers burned palely. A sacred awe\nfilled the air, driving them from the chamber.",
        "Felicite, who was so brave, who had never in her life flinched from\nanything, not even from bloodshed, fled as if she was pursued, saying:",
        "“Come, come, Martine, we will find some other way; we will go look for\nan instrument.”",
        "In the study they drew a breath of relief. Felicite looked in vain\namong the papers on Pascal’s work-table for the genealogical tree,\nwhich she knew was usually there. She would so gladly have begun her\nwork of destruction with this. It was there, but in her feverish\nexcitement she did not perceive it.",
        "Her desire drew her back again to the press, and she stood before it,\nmeasuring it and examining it with eager and covetous look. In spite\nof her short stature, in spite of her eighty-odd years, she displayed\nan activity and an energy that were truly extraordinary.",
        "“Ah!” she repeated, “if I only had an instrument!”",
        "And she again sought the crevice in the colossus, the crack into which\nshe might introduce her fingers, to break it open. She imagined plans\nof assault, she thought of using force, and then she fell back on\nstratagem, on some piece of treachery which would open to her the\ndoors, merely by breathing upon them.",
        "Suddenly her glance kindled; she had discovered the means.",
        "“Tell me, Martine; there is a hook fastening one of the doors, is\nthere not?”",
        "“Yes, madame; it catches in a ring above the middle shelf. See, it is\nabout the height of this molding.”",
        "Felicite made a triumphant gesture.",
        "“Have you a gimlet–a large gimlet? Give me a gimlet!”",
        "Martine went down into her kitchen and brought back the tool that had\nbeen asked.",
        "“In that way, you see, we shall make no noise,” resumed the old woman,\nsetting herself to her task.",
        "With a strength which one would not have suspected in her little\nhands, withered by age, she inserted the gimlet, and made a hole at\nthe height indicated by the servant. But it was too low; she felt the\npoint, after a time, entering the shelf. A second attempt brought the\ninstrument in direct contact with the iron hook. This time the hole\nwas too near. And she multiplied the holes to right and left, until\nfinally she succeeded in pushing the hook out of the ring. The bolt of\nthe lock slipped, and both doors opened.",
        "“At last!” cried Felicite, beside herself.",
        "Then she remained motionless for a moment, her ear turned uneasily\ntoward the bedroom, fearing that she had wakened Clotilde. But silence\nreigned throughout the dark and sleeping house. There came from the\nbedroom only the august peace of death; she heard nothing but the\nclear vibration of the clock; Clotilde fell asleep near one. And the\npress yawned wide open, displaying the papers with which it\noverflowed, heaped up on its three shelves. Then she threw herself\nupon it, and the work of destruction began, in the midst of the sacred\nobscurity of the infinite repose of this funereal vigil.",
        "“At last!” she repeated, in a low voice, “after thirty years of\nwaiting. Let us hurry–let us hurry. Martine, help me!”",
        "She had already drawn forward the high chair of the desk, and mounted\non it at a bound, to take down, first of all, the papers on the top\nshelf, for she remembered that the envelopes were there. But she was\nsurprised not to see the thick blue paper wrappers; there was nothing\nthere but bulky manuscripts, the doctor’s completed but unpublished\nworks, works of inestimable value, all his researches, all his\ndiscoveries, the monument of his future fame, which he had left in\nRamond’s charge. Doubtless, some days before his death, thinking that\nonly the envelopes were in danger, and that no one in the world would\nbe so daring as to destroy his other works, he had begun to classify\nand arrange the papers anew, and removed the envelopes out of sight.",
        "“Ah, so much the worse!” murmured Felicite; “let us begin anywhere;\nthere are so many of them that if we wish to get through we must\nhurry. While I am up here, let us clear these away forever. Here,\ncatch Martine!”",
        "And she emptied the shelf, throwing the manuscripts, one by one, into\nthe arms of the servant, who laid them on the table with as little\nnoise as possible. Soon the whole heap was on it, and Felicite sprang\ndown from the chair.",
        "“To the fire! to the fire! We shall lay our hands on the others, and\ntoo, by and by, on those I am looking for. These can go into it,\nmeantime. It will be a good riddance, at any rate, a fine clearance,\nyes, indeed! To the fire, to the fire with them all, even to the\nsmallest scrap of paper, even to the most illegible scrawl, if we wish\nto be certain of destroying the contamination of evil.”",
        "She herself, fanatical and fierce, in her hatred of the truth, in her\neagerness to destroy the testimony of science, tore off the first page\nof one of the manuscripts, lighted it at the lamp, and then threw this\nburning brand into the great fireplace, in which there had not been a\nfire for perhaps twenty years, and she fed the fire, continuing to\nthrow on it the rest of the manuscript, piece by piece. The servant,\nas determined as herself, came to her assistance, taking another\nenormous notebook, which she tore up leaf by leaf. From this forth the\nfire did not cease to burn, filling the wide fireplace with a bright\nblaze, with tongues of flame that seemed to die away from time to\ntime, only to burn up more brightly than ever when fresh fuel fed\nthem. The fire grew larger, the heap of ashes rose higher and higher–\na thick bed of blackened leaves among which ran millions of sparks.\nBut it was a long, a never-ending task; for when several pages were\nthrown on at a time, they would not burn; it was necessary to move\nthem and turn them over with the tongs; the best way was to stir them\nup and then wait until they were in a blaze, before adding more. The\nwomen soon grew skilful at their task, and the work progressed at a\nrapid rate.",
        "In her haste to get a fresh armful of papers Felicite stumbled against\na chair.",
        "“Oh, madame, take care,” said Martine. “Some one might come!”",
        "“Come? who should come? Clotilde? She is too sound asleep, poor girl.\nAnd even if any one should come, once it is finished, I don’t care; I\nwon’t hide myself, you may be sure; I shall leave the empty press\nstanding wide open; I shall say aloud that it is I who have purified\nthe house. When there is not a line of writing left, ah, good heavens!\nI shall laugh at everything else!”",
        "For almost two hours the fireplace blazed. They went back to the press\nand emptied the two other shelves, and now there remained only the\nbottom, which was heaped with a confusion of papers. Little by little,\nintoxicated by the heat of the bonfire, out of breath and perspiring,\nthey gave themselves up to the savage joy of destruction. They stooped\ndown, they blackened their hands, pushing in the partially consumed\nfragments, with gestures so violent, so feverishly excited, that their\ngray locks fell in disorder over their shoulders. It was like a dance\nof witches, feeding a hellish fire for some abominable act–the\nmartyrdom of a saint, the burning of written thought in the public\nsquare; a whole world of truth and hope destroyed. And the blaze of\nthis fire, which at moments made the flame of the lamp grow pale,\nlighted up the vast apartment, and made the gigantic shadows of the\ntwo women dance upon the ceiling.",
        "But as she was emptying the bottom of the press, after having burned,\nhandful by handful, the papers with which it had been filled, Felicite\nuttered a stifled cry of triumph.",
        "“Ah, here they are! To the fire! to the fire!”",
        "She had at last come upon the envelopes. Far back, behind the rampart\nformed by the notes, the doctor had hidden the blue paper wrappers.\nAnd then began a mad work of havoc, a fury of destruction; the\nenvelopes were gathered up in handfuls and thrown into the flames,\nfilling the fireplace with a roar like that of a conflagration.",
        "“They are burning, they are burning! They are burning at last! Here is\nanother, Martine, here is another. Ah, what a fire, what a glorious\nfire!”",
        "But the servant was becoming uneasy.",
        "“Take care, madame, you are going to set the house on fire. Don’t you\nhear that roar?”",
        "“Ah! what does that matter? Let it all burn. They are burning, they\nare burning; what a fine sight! Three more, two more, and, see, now\nthe last is burning!”",
        "She laughed with delight, beside herself, terrible to see, when some\nfragment of lighted soot fell down. The roar was becoming more and\nmore fierce; the chimney, which was never swept, had caught fire. This\nseemed to excite her still more, while the servant, losing her head,\nbegan to scream and run about the room.",
        "Clotilde slept beside the dead Pascal, in the supreme calm of the\nbedroom, unbroken save by the light vibration of the clock striking\nthe hours. The tapers burned with a tall, still flame, the air was\nmotionless. And yet, in the midst of her heavy, dreamless sleep, she\nheard, as in a nightmare, a tumult, an ever-increasing rush and roar.\nAnd when she opened her eyes she could not at first understand. Where\nwas she? Why this enormous weight that crushed her heart? She came\nback to reality with a start of terror–she saw Pascal, she heard\nMartine’s cries in the adjoining room, and she rushed out, in alarm,\nto learn their cause.",
        "But at the threshold Clotilde took in the whole scene with cruel\ndistinctness–the press wide open and completely empty; Martine\nmaddened by her fear of fire; Felicite radiant, pushing into the\nflames with her foot the last fragments of the envelopes. Smoke and\nflying soot filled the study, where the roaring of the fire sounded\nlike the hoarse gasping of a murdered man–the fierce roar which she\nhad just heard in her sleep.",
        "And the cry which sprang from her lips was the same cry that Pascal\nhimself had uttered on the night of the storm, when he surprised her\nin the act of stealing his papers.",
        "“Thieves! assassins!”",
        "She precipitated herself toward the fireplace, and, in spite of the\ndreadful roaring of the flames, in spite of the falling pieces of\nsoot, at the risk of setting her hair on fire, and of burning her\nhands, she gathered up the leaves which remained yet unconsumed and\nbravely extinguished them, pressing them against her. But all this was\nvery little, only some debris; not a complete page remained, not\neven a few fragments of the colossal labor, of the vast and patient\nwork of a lifetime, which the fire had destroyed there in two hours.\nAnd with growing anger, in a burst of furious indignation, she cried:",
        "“You are thieves, assassins! It is a wicked murder which you have just\ncommitted. You have profaned death, you have slain the mind, you have\nslain genius.”",
        "Old Mme. Rougon did not quail. She advanced, on the contrary, feeling\nno remorse, her head erect, defending the sentence of destruction\npronounced and executed by her.",
        "“It is to me you are speaking, to your grandmother. Is there nothing,\nthen, that you respect? I have done what I ought to have done, what\nyou yourself wished to do with us before.”",
        "“Before, you had made me mad; but since then I have lived, I have\nloved, I have understood, and it is life that I defend. Even if it be\nterrible and cruel, the truth ought to be respected. Besides, it was a\nsacred legacy bequeathed to my protection, the last thoughts of a dead\nman, all that remained of a great mind, and which I should have\nobliged every one to respect. Yes, you are my grandmother; I am well\naware of it, and it is as if you had just burned your son!”",
        "“Burn Pascal because I have burned his papers!” cried Felicite. “Do\nyou not know that I would have burned the town to save the honor of\nour family!”",
        "She continued to advance, belligerent and victorious; and Clotilde,\nwho had laid on the table the blackened fragments rescued by her from\nthe burning flames, protected them with her body, fearing that her\ngrandmother would throw them back again into the fire. She regarded\nthe two women scornfully; she did not even trouble herself about the\nfire in the fireplace, which fortunately went out of itself, while\nMartine extinguished with the shovel the burning soot and the last\nflames of the smoldering ashes.",
        "“You know very well, however,” continued the old woman, whose little\nfigure seemed to grow taller, “that I have had only one ambition, one\npassion in life–to see our family rich and powerful. I have fought, I\nhave watched all my life, I have lived as long as I have done, only to\nput down ugly stories and to leave our name a glorious one. Yes, I\nhave never despaired; I have never laid down my arms; I have been\ncontinually on the alert, ready to profit by the slightest\ncircumstance. And all I desired to do I have done, because I have\nknown how to wait.”",
        "And she waved her hand toward the empty press and the fireplace, where\nthe last sparks were dying out.",
        "“Now it is ended, our honor is safe; those abominable papers will no\nlonger accuse us, and I shall leave behind me nothing to be feared.\nThe Rougons have triumphed.”",
        "Clotilde, in a frenzy of grief, raised her arm, as if to drive her out\nof the room. But she left it of her own accord, and went down to the\nkitchen to wash her blackened hands and to fasten up her hair. The\nservant was about to follow her when, turning her head, she saw her\nyoung mistress’ gesture, and she returned.",
        "“Oh! as for me, mademoiselle, I will go away the day after to-morrow,\nwhen monsieur shall be in the cemetery.”",
        "There was a moment’s silence.",
        "“But I am not sending you away, Martine. I know well that it is not\nyou who are most to blame. You have lived in this house for thirty\nyears. Remain, remain with me.”",
        "The old maid shook her gray head, looking very pale and tired.",
        "“No, I have served monsieur; I will serve no one after monsieur.”",
        "“But I!”",
        "“You, no!”",
        "Clotilde looked embarrassed, hesitated a moment, and remained silent.\nBut Martine understood; she too seemed to reflect for an instant, and\nthen she said distinctly:",
        "“I know what you would say, but–no!”",
        "And she went on to settle her account, arranging the affair like a\npractical woman who knew the value of money.",
        "“Since I have the means, I will go and live quietly on my income\nsomewhere. As for you, mademoiselle, I can leave you, for you are not\npoor. M. Ramond will explain to you to-morrow how an income of four\nthousand francs was saved for you out of the money at the notary’s.\nMeantime, here is the key of the desk, where you will find the five\nthousand francs which monsieur left there. Oh? I know that there will\nbe no trouble between us. Monsieur did not pay me for the last three\nmonths; I have papers from him which prove it. In addition, I advanced\nlately almost two hundred francs out of my own pocket, without his\nknowing where the money came from. It is all written down; I am not at\nall uneasy; mademoiselle will not wrong me by a centime. The day after\nto-morrow, when monsieur is no longer here, I will go away.”",
        "Then she went down to the kitchen, and Clotilde, in spite of the\nfanaticism of this woman, which had made her take part in a crime,\nfelt inexpressibly sad at this desertion. When she was gathering up\nthe fragments of the papers, however, before returning to the bedroom,\nshe had a thrill of joy, on suddenly seeing the genealogical tree,\nwhich the two women had not perceived, lying unharmed on the table. It\nwas the only entire document saved from the wreck. She took it and\nlocked it, with the half-consumed fragments, in the bureau in the\nbedroom.",
        "But when she found herself again in this august chamber a great\nemotion took possession of her. What supreme calm, what immortal\npeace, reigned here, beside the savage destruction that had filled the\nadjoining room with smoke and ashes. A sacred serenity pervaded the\nobscurity; the two tapers burned with a pure, still, unwavering flame.\nThen she saw that Pascal’s face, framed in his flowing white hair and\nbeard, had become very white. He slept with the light falling upon\nhim, surrounded by a halo, supremely beautiful. She bent down, kissed\nhim again, felt on her lips the cold of the marble face, with its\nclosed eyelids, dreaming its dream of eternity. Her grief at not being\nable to save the work which he had left to her care was so\noverpowering that she fell on her knees and burst into a passion of\nsobs. Genius had been violated; it seemed to her as if the world was\nabout to be destroyed in this savage destruction of a whole life of\nlabor.",
