        "  In the vehemence of her feelings, Hua (Hsi Jen) on a quiet evening\n      admonishes Pao-yü.\n  While (the spell) of affection continues unbroken, Pao-yü, on a still\n      day, perceives the fragrance emitted from Tai-yü’s person.",
        "The Chia consort, we must now go on to explain, returned to the Palace,\nand the next day, on her appearance in the presence of His Majesty, she\nthanked him for his bounty and gave him furthermore an account of her\nexperiences on her visit home. His Majesty’s dragon countenance was much\nelated, and he also issued from the privy store coloured satins, gold\nand silver and such like articles to be presented to Chia Cheng and the\nother officials in the various households of her relatives. But\ndispensing with minute details about them, we will now revert to the two\nmansions of Jung and Ning.",
        "With the extreme strain on mind and body for successive days, the\nstrength of one and all was, in point of fact, worn out and their\nrespective energies exhausted. And it was besides after they had been\nputting by the various decorations and articles of use for two or three\ndays, that they, at length, got through the work.",
        "Lady Feng was the one who had most to do, and whose responsibilities\nwere greatest. The others could possibly steal a few leisure moments and\nretire to rest, while she was the sole person who could not slip away.\nIn the second place, naturally anxious as she was to excel and both to\nfall in people’s estimation, she put up with the strain just as if she\nwere like one of those who had nothing to attend to. But the one who had\nthe least to do and had the most leisure was Pao-yü.",
        "As luck would have it on this day, at an early hour, Hsi Jen’s mother\ncame again in person and told dowager lady Chia that she would take Hsi\nJen home to drink a cup of tea brewed in the new year and that she would\nreturn in the evening. For this reason Pao-yü was only in the company of\nall the waiting-maids, throwing dice, playing at chess and amusing\nhimself. But while he was in the room playing with them with a total\nabsence of zest, he unawares perceived a few waiting-maids arrive, who\ninformed him that their senior master Mr. Chen, of the Eastern Mansion,\nhad come to invite him to go and see a theatrical performance, and the\nfireworks, which were to be let off.",
        "Upon hearing these words, Pao-yü speedily asked them to change his\nclothes; but just as he was ready to start, presents of cream, steamed\nwith sugar, arrived again when least expected from the Chia Consort, and\nPao-yü recollecting with what relish Hsi Jen had partaken of this dish\non the last occasion forthwith bid them keep it for her; while he went\nhimself and told dowager lady Chia that he was going over to see the\nplay.",
        "The plays sung over at Chia Chen’s consisted, who would have thought it,\nof “Ting L’ang recognises his father,” and “Huang Po-ying deploys the\nspirits for battle,” and in addition to these, “Sung Hsing-che causes\ngreat commotion in the heavenly palace;” “Ghiang T’ai-kung kills the\ngeneral and deifies him,” and other such like. Soon appeared the spirits\nand devils in a confused crowd on the stage, and suddenly also became\nvisible the whole band of sprites and goblins, among which were some\nwaving streamers, as they went past in a procession, invoking Buddha and\nburning incense. The sound of the gongs and drums and of shouts and\ncries were audible at a distance beyond the lane; and in the whole\nstreet, one and all extolled the performance as exceptionally grand, and\nthat the like could never have been had in the house of any other\nfamily.",
        "Pao-yü, noticing that the commotion and bustle had reached a stage so\nunbearable to his taste, speedily betook himself, after merely sitting\nfor a little while, to other places in search of relaxation and fun.\nFirst of all, he entered the inner rooms, and after spending some time\nin chatting and laughing with Mrs. Yu, the waiting-maids, and secondary\nwives, he eventually took his departure out of the second gate; and as\nMrs. Yu and her companions were still under the impression that he was\ngoing out again to see the play, they let him speed on his way, without\nso much as keeping an eye over him.",
        "Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Hsúeh P’an and the others were bent upon guessing\nenigmas, enforcing the penalties and enjoying themselves in a hundred\nand one ways, so that even allowing that they had for a moment noticed\nthat he was not occupying his seat, they must merely have imagined that\nhe had gone inside and not, in fact, worried their minds about him. And\nas for the pages, who had come along with Pao-yü, those who were a\nlittle advanced in years, knowing very well that Pao-yü would, on an\noccasion like the present, be sure not to be going before dusk,\nstealthily therefore took advantage of his absence, those, who could, to\ngamble for money, and others to go to the houses of relatives and\nfriends to drink of the new year tea, so that what with gambling and\ndrinking the whole bevy surreptitiously dispersed, waiting for dusk\nbefore they came back; while those, who were younger, had all crept into\nthe green rooms to watch the excitement; with the result that Pao-yü\nperceiving not one of them about bethought himself of a small reading\nroom, which existed in previous days on this side, in which was\nsuspended a picture of a beauty so artistically executed as to look\nlife-like. “On such a bustling day as this,” he reasoned, “it’s pretty\ncertain, I fancy, that there will be no one in there; and that beautiful\nperson must surely too feel lonely, so that it’s only right that I\nshould go and console her a bit.” With these thoughts, he hastily betook\nhimself towards the side-house yonder, and as soon as he came up to the\nwindow, he heard the sound of groans in the room. Pao-yü was really\nquite startled. “What!” (he thought), “can that beautiful girl,\npossibly, have come to life!” and screwing up his courage, he licked a\nhole in the paper of the window and peeped in. It was not she, however,\nwho had come to life, but Ming Yen holding down a girl and likewise\nindulging in what the Monitory Dream Fairy had taught him.",
        "“Dreadful!” exclaimed Pao-yü, aloud, unable to repress himself, and,\nstamping one of his feet, he walked into the door to the terror of both\nof them, who parting company, shivered with fear, like clothes that are\nbeing shaken. Ming Yen perceiving that it was Pao-yü promptly fell on\nhis knees and piteously implored for pardon.",
        "“What! in broad daylight! what do you mean by it? Were your master Mr.\nChen to hear of it, would you die or live?” asked Pao-yü, as he\nsimultaneously cast a glance at the servant-girl, who although not a\nbeauty was anyhow so spick and span, and possessed besides a few charms\nsufficient to touch the heart. From shame, her face was red and her ears\npurple, while she lowered her head and uttered not a syllable.",
        "Pao-yü stamped his foot. “What!” he shouted, “don’t you yet bundle\nyourself away!”",
        "This simple remark suggested the idea to the girl’s mind who ran off, as\nif she had wings to fly with; but as Pao-yü went also so far as to go in\npursuit of her, calling out: “Don’t be afraid, I’m not one to tell\nanyone,” Ming Yen was so exasperated that he cried, as he went after\nthem, “My worthy ancestor, this is distinctly telling people about it.”",
        "“How old is that servant girl?” Pao-yü having asked; “She’s, I expect,\nno more than sixteen or seventeen,” Ming Yen rejoined.",
        "“Well, if you haven’t gone so far as to even ascertain her age,” Pao-yü\nobserved, “you’re sure to know still less about other things; and it\nmakes it plain enough that her acquaintance with you is all vain and\nfutile! What a pity! what a pity!”",
        "He then went on to enquire what her name was; and “Were I,” continued\nMing Yen smiling, “to tell you about her name it would involve a long\nyarn; it’s indeed a novel and strange story! She relates that while her\nmother was nursing her, she dreamt a dream and obtained in this dream\npossession of a piece of brocaded silk, on which were designs, in\nvariegated colours, representing opulence and honour, and a continuous\nline of the character Wan; and that this reason accounts for the name of\nWan Erh, which was given her.”",
        "“This is really strange!” Pao-yü exclaimed with a grin, after lending an\near to what he had to say; “and she is bound, I think, by and by to have\na good deal of good fortune!”",
        "These words uttered, he plunged in deep thought for a while, and Ming\nYen having felt constrained to inquire: “Why aren’t you, Mr. Secundus,\nwatching a theatrical performance of this excellent kind?” “I had been\nlooking on for ever so long,” Pao-yü replied, “until I got quite weary;\nand had just come out for a stroll, when I happened to meet you two. But\nwhat’s to be done now?”",
        "Ming Yen gave a faint smile. “As there’s no one here to know anything\nabout it,” he added, “I’ll stealthily take you, Mr. Secundus, for a walk\noutside the city walls; and we’ll come back shortly, before they’ve got\nwind of it.”",
        "“That won’t do,” Pao-yü demurred, “we must be careful, or else some\nbeggar might kidnap us away; besides, were they to come to hear of it,\nthere’ll be again a dreadful row; and isn’t it better that we should go\nto some nearer place, from which we could, after all, return at once?”",
        "“As for some nearer place,” Ming Yen observed; “to whose house can we\ngo? It’s really no easy matter!”",
        "“My idea is,” Pao-yü suggested with a smirk, “that we should simply go,\nand find sister Hua, and see what she’s up to at home.”",
        "“Yes! Yes!” Ming Yen replied laughingly; “the fact is I had forgotten\nall about her home; but should it reach their ears,” he continued,\n“they’ll say that it was I who led you, Mr. Secundus, astray, and\nthey’ll beat me!”",
        "“I’m here for you!” Pao-yü having assured him; Ming Yen at these words\nled the horses round, and the two of them speedily made their exit by\nthe back gate. Luckily Hsi Jen’s house was not far off. It was no\nfurther than half a li’s distance, so that in a twinkle they had already\nreached the front of the door, and Ming Yen was the first to walk in and\nto call for Hsi Jen’s eldest brother Hua Tzu-fang.",
        "Hsi Jen’s mother had, on this occasion, united in her home Hsi Jen,\nseveral of her sister’s daughters, as well as a few of her nieces, and\nthey were engaged in partaking of fruits and tea, when they heard some\none outside call out, “Brother Hua.” Hua Tzu-fang lost no time in\nrushing out; and upon looking and finding that it was the two of them,\nthe master and his servant, he was so taken by surprise that his fears\ncould not be set at rest. Promptly, he clasped Pao-yü in his arms and\ndismounted him, and coming into the court, he shouted out at the top of\nhis voice: “Mr. Pao has come.” The other persons heard the announcement\nof his arrival, with equanimity, but when it reached Hsi Jen’s ears, she\ntruly felt at such a loss to fathom the object of his visit that issuing\nhastily out of the room, she came to meet Pao-yü, and as she laid hold\nof him: “Why did you come?” she asked.",
        "“I felt awfully dull,” Pao-yü rejoined with a smile, “and came to see\nwhat you were up to.”",
        "Hsi Jen at these words banished, at last, all anxiety from her mind.\n“You’re again up to your larks,” she observed, “but what’s the aim of\nyour visit? Who else has come along with him?” she at the same time went\non to question Ming Yen.",
        "“All the others know nothing about it!” explained Ming Yen exultingly;\n“only we two do, that’s all.”",
        "When Hsi Jen heard this remark, she gave way afresh to solicitous fears:\n“This is dreadful!” she added; “for were you to come across any one from\nthe house, or to meet master; or were, in the streets, people to press\nagainst you, or horses to collide with you, as to make (his horse) shy,\nand he were to fall, would that too be a joke? The gall of both of you\nis larger than a peck measure; but it’s all you, Ming Yen, who has\nincited him, and when I go back, I’ll surely tell the nurses to beat\nyou.”",
        "Ming Yen pouted his mouth. “Mr. Secundus,” he pleaded, “abused me and\nbeat me, as he bade me bring him here, and now he shoves the blame on my\nshoulders! ’Don’t let us go,’ I suggested; ’but if you do insist, well\nthen let us go and have done.’”",
        "Hua Tzu-fang promptly interceded. “Let things alone,” he said; “now that\nthey’re already here, there’s no need whatever of much ado. The only\nthing is that our mean house with its thatched roof is both so crammed\nand so filthy that how could you, sir, sit in it!”",
        "Hsi Jen’s mother also came out at an early period to receive him, and\nHsi Jen pulled Pao-yü in. Once inside the room, Pao-yü perceived three\nor five girls, who, as soon as they caught sight of him approaching, all\nlowered their heads, and felt so bashful that their faces were suffused\nwith blushes. But as both Hua Tzu-fang and his mother were afraid that\nPao-yü would catch cold, they pressed him to take a seat on the\nstove-bed, and hastened to serve a fresh supply of refreshments, and to\nat once bring him a cup of good tea.",
        "“You needn’t be flurrying all for nothing,” Hsi Jen smilingly\ninterposed; “I, naturally, should know; and there’s no use of even\nlaying out any fruits, as I daren’t recklessly give him anything to\neat.”",
        "Saying this, she simultaneously took her own cushion and laid it on a\nstool, and after Pao-yü took a seat on it, she placed the footstove she\nhad been using, under his feet; and producing, from a satchet, two\npeach-blossom-scented small cakes, she opened her own hand-stove and\nthrew them into the fire; which done, she covered it well again and\nplaced it in Pao-yü’s lap. And eventually, she filled her own tea-cup\nwith tea and presented it to Pao-yü, while, during this time, her mother\nand sister had been fussing about, laying out in fine array a tableful\nof every kind of eatables.",
        "Hsi Jen noticed that there were absolutely no things that he could eat,\nbut she felt urged to say with a smile: “Since you’ve come, it isn’t\nright that you should go empty away; and you must, whether the things be\ngood or bad, taste a little, so that it may look like a visit to my\nhouse!”",
        "As she said this, she forthwith took several seeds of the fir-cone, and\ncracking off the thin skin, she placed them in a handkerchief and\npresented them to Pao-yü. But Pao-yü, espying that Hsi Jen’s two eyes\nwere slightly red, and that the powder was shiny and moist, quietly\ntherefore inquired of Hsi Jen, “Why do you cry for no rhyme or reason?”",
        "“Why should I cry?” Hsi Jen laughed; “something just got into my eyes\nand I rubbed them.” By these means she readily managed to evade\ndetection; but seeing that Pao-yü wore a deep red archery-sleeved\npelisse, ornamented with gold dragons, and lined with fur from foxes’\nribs and a grey sable fur surtout with a fringe round the border. “What!\nhave you,” she asked, “put on again your new clothes for? specially to\ncome here? and didn’t they inquire of you where you were going?”",
        "“I had changed,” Pao-yü explained with a grin, “as Mr. Chen had invited\nme to go over and look at the play.”",
        "“Well, sit a while and then go back;” Hsi Jen continued as she nodded\nher head; “for this isn’t the place for you to come to!”",
        "“You’d better be going home now,” Pao-yü suggested smirkingly; “where\nI’ve again kept something good for you.”",
        "“Gently,” smiled Hsi Jen, “for were you to let them hear, what figure\nwould we cut?” And with these, words, she put out her hand and\nunclasping from Pao-yü’s neck the jade of Spiritual Perception, she\nfaced her cousins and remarked exultingly. “Here! see for yourselves;\nlook at this and learn! When I repeatedly talked about it, you all\nthought it extraordinary, and were anxious to have a glance at it;\nto-day, you may gaze on it with all your might, for whatever precious\nthing you may by and by come to see will really never excel such an\nobject as this!”",
        "When she had finished speaking, she handed it over to them, and after\nthey had passed it round for inspection, she again fastened it properly\non Pao-yü’s neck, and also bade her brother go and hire a small\ncarriage, or engage a small chair, and escort Pao-yü back home.",
        "“If I see him back,” Hua Tzu-fang remarked, “there would be no harm,\nwere he even to ride his horse!”",
        "“It isn’t because of harm,” Hsi Jen replied; “but because he may come\nacross some one from the house.”",
        "Hua Tzu-fang promptly went and bespoke a small chair; and when it came\nto the door, the whole party could not very well detain him, and they of\ncourse had to see Pao-yü out of the house; while Hsi Jen, on the other\nhand, snatched a few fruits and gave them to Ming Yen; and as she at the\nsame time pressed in his hand several cash to buy crackers with to let\noff, she enjoined him not to tell any one as he himself would likewise\nincur blame.",
        "As she uttered these words, she straightway escorted Pao-yü as far as\noutside the door, from whence having seen him mount into the sedan\nchair, she dropped the curtain; whereupon Ming Yen and her brother, the\ntwo of them, led the horses and followed behind in his wake. Upon\nreaching the street where the Ning mansion was situated, Ming Yen told\nthe chair to halt, and said to Hua Tzu-fang, “It’s advisable that I\nshould again go, with Mr. Secundus, into the Eastern mansion, to show\nourselves before we can safely betake ourselves home; for if we don’t,\npeople will suspect!”",
        "Hua Tzu-fang, upon hearing that there was good reason in what he said,\npromptly clasped Pao-yü out of the chair and put him on the horse,\nwhereupon after Pao-yü smilingly remarked: “Excuse me for the trouble\nI’ve surely put you to,” they forthwith entered again by the back gate;\nbut putting aside all details, we will now confine ourselves to Pao-yü.",
        "After he had walked out of the door, the several waiting-maids in his\napartments played and laughed with greater zest and with less restraint.\nSome there were who played at chess, others who threw the dice or had a\ngame of cards; and they covered the whole floor with the shells of\nmelon-seeds they were cracking, when dame Li, his nurse, happened to\ncome in, propping herself on a staff, to pay her respects and to see\nPao-yü, and perceiving that Pao-yü was not at home and that the\nservant-girls were only bent upon romping, she felt intensely disgusted.\n“Since I’ve left this place,” she therefore exclaimed with a sigh, “and\ndon’t often come here, you’ve become more and more unmannerly; while the\nother nurse does still less than ever venture to expostulate with you;\nPao-yü is like a candlestick eighty feet high, shedding light on others,\nand throwing none upon himself! All he knows is to look down upon people\nas being filthy; and yet this is his room and he allows you to put it\ntopsy-turvey, and to become more and more unmindful of decorum!”",
        "These servant-girls were well aware that Pao-yü was not particular in\nthese respects, and that in the next place nurse Li, having pleaded old\nage, resigned her place and gone home, had nowadays no control over\nthem, so that they simply gave their minds to romping and joking, and\npaid no heed whatever to her. Nurse Li however still kept on asking\nabout Pao-yü, “How much rice he now ate at one meal? and at what time he\nwent to sleep?” to which questions, the servant-girls replied quite at\nrandom; some there being too who observed: “What a dreadful despicable\nold thing she is!”",
        "“In this covered bowl,” she continued to inquire, “is cream, and why not\ngive it to me to eat?” and having concluded these words, she took it up\nand there and then began eating it.",
        "“Be quick, and leave it alone!” a servant-girl expostulated, “that, he\nsaid, was kept in order to be given to Hsi Jen; and on his return, when\nhe again gets into a huff, you, old lady, must, on your own motion,\nconfess to having eaten it, and not involve us in any way as to have to\nbear his resentment.”",
        "Nurse Li, at these words, felt both angry and ashamed. “I can’t\nbelieve,” she forthwith remarked, “that he has become so bad at heart!\nNot to speak of the milk I’ve had, I have, in fact every right to even\nsomething more expensive than this; for is it likely that he holds Hsi\nJen dearer than myself? It can’t forsooth be that he doesn’t bear in\nmind how that I’ve brought him up to be a big man, and how that he has\neaten my blood transformed into milk and grown up to this age! and will\nbe because I’m now having a bowl of milk of his be angry on that score!\nI shall, yes, eat it, and we’ll see what he’ll do! I don’t know what you\npeople think of Hsi Jen, but she was a lowbred girl, whom I’ve with my\nown hands raised up! and what fine object indeed was she!”",
        "As she spoke, she flew into a temper, and taking the cream she drank the\nwhole of it.",
        "“They don’t know how to speak properly!” another servant-girl interposed\nsarcastically, “and it’s no wonder that you, old lady, should get angry!\nPao-yü still sends you, venerable dame, presents as a proof of his\ngratitude, and is it possible that he will feel displeased for such a\nthing like this?”",
        "“You girls shouldn’t also pretend to be artful flatterers to cajole me!\"\nnurse Li added; “do you imagine that I’m not aware of the dismissal, the\nother day, of Hsi Hsüeh, on account of a cup of tea? and as it’s clear\nenough that I’ve incurred blame, I’ll come by and by and receive it!”",
        "Having said this, she went off in a dudgeon, but not a long interval\nelapsed before Pao-yü returned, and gave orders to go and fetch Hsi Jen;\nand perceiving Ching Ling reclining on the bed perfectly still: “I\npresume she’s ill,” Pao-yü felt constrained to inquire, “or if she isn’t\nill, she must have lost at cards.”",
        "“Not so!” observed Chiu Wen; “she had been a winner, but dame Li came in\nquite casually and muddled her so that she lost; and angry at this she\nrushed off to sleep.”",
        "“Don’t place yourselves,” Pao-yü smiled, “on the same footing as nurse\nLi, and if you were to let her alone, everything will be all right.”",
        "These words were still on his lips when Hsi Jen arrived. After the\nmutual salutations, Hsi Jen went on to ask of Pao-yü: “Where did you\nhave your repast? and what time did you come back?” and to present\nlikewise, on behalf of her mother and sister, her compliments to all the\ngirls, who were her companions. In a short while, she changed her\ncostume and divested herself of her fineries, and Pao-yü bade them fetch\nthe cream.",
        "“Nurse Li has eaten it,” the servant-girls rejoined, and as Pao-yü was\non the point of making some remark Hsi Jen hastened to interfere,\nlaughing the while; “Is it really this that you had kept for me? many\nthanks for the trouble; the other day, when I had some, I found it very\ntoothsome, but after I had partaken of it, I got a pain in the stomach,\nand was so much upset, that it was only after I had brought it all up\nthat I felt all right. So it’s as well that she has had it, for, had it\nbeen kept here, it would have been wasted all for no use! What I fancy\nare dry chestnuts; and while you clean a few for me, I’ll go and lay the\nbed!”",
        "Pao-yü upon hearing these words credited them as true, so that he\ndiscarded all thought of the cream and fetched the chestnuts, which he,\nwith his own hands, selected and pealed. Perceiving at the same time\nthat none of the party were present in the room, he put on a smile and\ninquired of Hsi Jen: “Who were those persons dressed in red to day?”",
        "“They’re my two cousins on my mother’s side,” Hsi Jen explained, and\nhearing this, Pao-yü sang their praise as he heaved a couple of sighs.",
        "“What are you sighing for?” Hsi Jen remarked. “I know the secret reasons\nof your heart; it’s I fancy because she isn’t fit to wear red!”",
        "“It isn’t that,” Pao-yü protested smilingly, “it isn’t that; if such a\nperson as that isn’t good enough to be dressed in red, who would\nforsooth presume to wear it? It’s because I find her so really lovely!\nand if we could, after all, manage to get her into our family, how nice\nit would be then!”",
        "Hsi Jen gave a sardonic smile. “That it’s my own fate to be a slave\r\ndoesn’t matter, but is it likely that the destiny of even my very\nrelatives could be to become one and all of them bond servants? But you\nshould certainly set your choice upon some really beautiful girl, for\nshe would in that case be good enough to enter your house.”",
        "“Here you are again with your touchiness!” Pao-yü eagerly exclaimed\nsmiling, “if I said that she should come to our house, does it\nnecessarily imply that she should be a servant? and wouldn’t it do were\nI to mention that she should come as a relative!”",
        "“That too couldn’t exalt her to be a fit match for you!” rejoined Hsi\nJen; but Pao-yü being loth to continue the conversation, simply busied\nhimself with cleaning the chestnuts.",
        "“How is it you utter not a word?” Hsi Jen laughed; “I expect it’s\nbecause I just offended you by my inconsiderate talk! But if by and by\nyou have your purpose fixed on it, just spend a few ounces of silver to\npurchase them with, and bring them in and have done!”",
        "“How would you have one make any reply?” Pao-yü smilingly rejoined; “all\nI did was to extol her charms; for she’s really fit to have been born in\na deep hall and spacious court as this; and it isn’t for such foul\nthings as myself and others to contrariwise spend our days in this\nplace!”",
        "“Though deprived of this good fortune,” Hsi Jen explained, “she’s\nnevertheless also petted and indulged and the jewel of my maternal uncle\nand my aunt! She’s now seventeen years of age, and everything in the way\nof trousseau has been got ready, and she’s to get married next year.”",
        "Upon hearing the two words “get married,” he could not repress himself\nfrom again ejaculating: “Hai hai!” but while he was in an unhappy frame\nof mind, he once more heard Hsi Jen remark as she heaved a sigh: “Ever\nsince I’ve come here, we cousins haven’t all these years been able to\nget to live together, and now that I’m about to return home, they, on\nthe other hand, will all be gone!”",
        "Pao-yü, realising that there lurked in this remark some meaning or\nother, was suddenly so taken aback that dropping the chestnuts, he\ninquired: “How is it that you now want to go back?”",
        "“I was present to-day,” Hsi Jen explained, “when mother and brother held\nconsultation together, and they bade me be patient for another year, and\nthat next year they’ll come up and redeem me out of service!”",
        "Pao-yü, at these words, felt the more distressed. “Why do they want to\nredeem you?” he consequently asked.",
        "“This is a strange question!” Hsi Jen retorted, “for I can’t really be\ntreated as if I were the issue born in this homestead of yours! All the\nmembers of my family are elsewhere, and there’s only myself in this\nplace, so that how could I end my days here?”",
        "“If I don’t let you go, it will verily be difficult for you to get\naway!” Pao-yü replied.",
        "“There has never been such a principle of action!” urged Hsi Jen; “even\nin the imperial palace itself, there’s a fixed rule, by which possibly\nevery certain number of years a selection (of those who have to go takes\nplace), and every certain number of years a new batch enters; and\nthere’s no such practice as that of keeping people for ever; not to\nspeak of your own home.”",
        "Pao-yü realised, after reflection, that she, in point of fact, was\nright, and he went on to observe: “Should the old lady not give you your\nrelease, it will be impossible for you to get off.”",
        "“Why shouldn’t she release me?” Hsi Jen questioned. “Am I really so very\nextraordinary a person as to have perchance made such an impression upon\nher venerable ladyship and my lady that they will be positive in not\nletting me go? They may, in all likelihood, give my family some more\nounces of silver to keep me here; that possibly may come about. But, in\ntruth, I’m also a person of the most ordinary run, and there are many\nmore superior to me, yea very many! Ever since my youth up, I’ve been in\nher old ladyship’s service; first by waiting upon Miss Shih for several\nyears, and recently by being in attendance upon you for another term of\nyears; and now that our people will come to redeem me, I should, as a\nmatter of right, be told to go. My idea is that even the very redemption\nmoney won’t be accepted, and that they will display such grace as to let\nme go at once. And, as for being told that I can’t be allowed to go as\nI’m so diligent in my service to you, that’s a thing that can on no\naccount come about! My faithful attendance is an obligation of my\nduties, and is no exceptional service! and when I’m gone you’ll again\nhave some other faithful attendant, and it isn’t likely that when I’m no\nmore here, you’ll find it impracticable to obtain one!”",
        "After Pao-yü had listened to these various arguments, which proved the\nreasonableness of her going and the unreasonableness of any detention,\nhe felt his heart more than ever a prey to distress. “In spite of all\nyou say,” he therefore continued, “the sole desire of my heart is to\ndetain you; and I have no doubt but that the old lady will speak to your\nmother about it; and if she were to give your mother ample money,\nshe’ll, of course, not feel as if she could very well with any decency\ntake you home!”",
        "“My mother won’t naturally have the audacity to be headstrong!” Hsi Jen\nventured, “not to speak besides of the nice things, which may be told\nher and the lots of money she may, in addition, be given; but were she\neven not to be paid any compliments, and not so much as a single cash\ngiven her, she won’t, if you set your mind upon keeping me here, presume\nnot to comply with your wishes, were it also against my inclination. One\nthing however; our family would never rely upon prestige, and trust upon\nhonorability to do anything so domineering as this! for this isn’t like\nanything else, which, because you take a fancy to it, a hundred per cent\nprofit can be added, and it obtained for you! This action can be well\ntaken if the seller doesn’t suffer loss! But in the present instance,\nwere they to keep me back for no rhyme or reason, it would also be of no\nbenefit to yourself; on the contrary, they would be instrumental in\nkeeping us blood relatives far apart; a thing the like of which, I feel\npositive that dowager lady Chia and my lady will never do!”",
        "After lending an ear to this argument, Pao-yü cogitated within himself\nfor a while. “From what you say,” he then observed, “when you say you’ll\ngo, it means that you’ll go for certain!”",
        "“Yes, that I’ll go for certain,” Hsi Jen rejoined.",
        "“Who would have anticipated,” Pao-yü, after these words, mused in his\nown heart, “that a person like her would have shown such little sense of\ngratitude, and such a lack of respect! Had I,” he then remarked aloud\nwith a sigh, “been aware, at an early date, that your whole wish would\nhave been to go, I wouldn’t, in that case, have brought you over! But\nwhen you’re away, I shall remain alone, a solitary spirit!”",
        "As he spoke, he lost control over his temper, and, getting into bed, he\nwent to sleep.",
        "The fact is that when Hsi Jen had been at home, and she heard her mother\nand brother express their intention of redeeming her back, she there and\nthen observed that were she even at the point of death, she would not\nreturn home. “When in past days,” she had argued, “you had no rice to\neat, there remained myself, who was still worth several taels; and\nhadn’t I urged you to sell me, wouldn’t I have seen both father and\nmother die of starvation under my very eyes? and you’ve now had the good\nfortune of selling me into this place, where I’m fed and clothed just\nlike a mistress, and where I’m not beaten by day, nor abused by night!\nBesides, though now father be no more, you two have anyhow by putting\nthings straight again, so adjusted the family estate that it has resumed\nits primitive condition. And were you, in fact, still in straitened\ncircumstances, and you could by redeeming me back, make again some more\nmoney, that would be well and good; but the truth is that there’s no\nsuch need, and what would be the use for you to redeem me at such a time\nas this? You should temporarily treat me as dead and gone, and shouldn’t\nagain recall any idea of redeeming me!”",
        "Having in consequence indulged in a loud fit of crying, her mother and\nbrother resolved, when they perceived her in this determined frame of\nmind, that for a fact there was no need for her to come out of service.\nWhat is more they had sold her under contract until death, in the\ndistinct reliance that the Chia family, charitable and generous a family\nas it was, would, possibly, after no more than a few entreaties, make\nthem a present of her person as well as the purchase money. In the\nsecond place, never had they in the Chia mansion ill-used any of those\nbelow; there being always plenty of grace and little of imperiousness.\nBesides, the servant-girls, who acted as personal attendants in the\napartments of the old as well as of the young, were treated so far\nunlike the whole body of domestics in the household that the daughters\neven of an ordinary and penniless parentage could not have been so\nlooked up to. And these considerations induced both the mother as well\nas her son to at once dispel the intention and not to redeem her, and\nwhen Pao-yü had subsequently paid them an unexpected visit, and the two\nof them (Pao-yü and Hsi Jen) were seen to be also on such terms, the\nmother and her son obtained a clearer insight into their relations, and\nstill one more burden (which had pressed on their mind) fell to the\nground, and as besides this was a contingency, which they had never\nreckoned upon, they both composed their hearts, and did not again\nentertain any idea of ransoming her.",
        "It must be noticed moreover that Hsi Jen had ever since her youth not\nbeen blind to the fact that Pao-yü had an extraordinary temperament,\nthat he was self-willed and perverse, far even in excess of all young\nlads, and that he had, in addition, a good many peculiarities and many\nunspeakable defects. And as of late he had placed such reliance in the\nfond love of his grandmother that his father and mother even could not\nexercise any extreme control over him, he had become so much the more\nremiss, dissolute, selfish and unconcerned, not taking the least\npleasure in what was proper, that she felt convinced, whenever she\nentertained the idea of tendering him advice, that he would not listen\nto her. On this day, by a strange coincidence, came about the discussion\nrespecting her ransom, and she designedly made use, in the first\ninstance, of deception with a view to ascertain his feelings, to\nsuppress his temper, and to be able subsequently to extend to him some\nwords of admonition; and when she perceived that Pao-yü had now silently\ngone to sleep, she knew that his feelings could not brook the idea of\nher return and that his temper had already subsided. She had never had,\nas far as she was concerned, any desire of eating chestnuts, but as she\nfeared lest, on account of the cream, some trouble might arise, which\nmight again lead to the same results as when Hsi Hsüeh drank the tea,\nshe consequently made use of the pretence that she fancied chestnuts, in\norder to put off Pao-yü from alluding (to the cream) and to bring the\nmatter speedily to an end. But telling forthwith the young waiting-maids\nto take the chestnuts away and eat them, she herself came and pushed\nPao-yü; but at the sight of Pao-yü with the traces of tears on his face,\nshe at once put on a smiling expression and said: “What’s there in this\nto wound your heart? If you positively do wish to keep me, I shall, of\ncourse, not go away!”",
        "Pao-yü noticed that these words contained some hidden purpose, and\nreadily observed: “Do go on and tell me what else I can do to succeed in\nkeeping you here, for of my own self I find it indeed difficult to say\nhow!”",
        "“Of our friendliness all along,” Hsi Jen smilingly rejoined, “there’s\nnaturally no need to speak; but, if you have this day made up your mind\nto retain me here, it isn’t through this friendship that you’ll succeed\nin doing so. But I’ll go on and mention three distinct conditions, and,\nif you really do accede to my wishes, you’ll then have shown an earnest\ndesire to keep me here, and I won’t go, were even a sword to be laid on\nmy neck!”",
        "“Do tell me what these conditions are,” Pao-yü pressed her with\nalacrity, as he smiled, “and I’ll assent to one and all. My dear sister,\nmy own dear sister, not to speak of two or three, but even two or three\nhundred of them I’m quite ready to accept. All I entreat you is that you\nand all of you should combine to watch over me and take care of me,\nuntil some day when I shall be transformed into flying ashes; but flying\nashes are, after all, not opportune, as they have form and substance and\nthey likewise possess sense, but until I’ve been metamorphosed into a\nstreak of subtle smoke. And when the wind shall have with one puff\ndispelled me, all of you then will be unable to attend to me, just as\nmuch as I myself won’t be able to heed you. You will, when that time\ncomes, let me go where I please, as I’ll let you speed where you choose\nto go!”",
        "These words so harassed Hsi Jen that she hastened to put her hand over\nhis mouth. “Speak decently,” she said; “I was on account of this just\nabout to admonish you, and now here you are uttering all this still more\nloathsome trash.”",
        "“I won’t utter these words again,” Pao-yü eagerly added.",
        "“This is the first fault that you must change,” Hsi Jen replied.",
        "“I’ll amend,” Pao-yü observed, “and if I say anything of the kind again\nyou can wring my mouth; but what else is there?”",
        "“The second thing is this,” Hsi Jen explained; “whether you really like\nto study or whether you only pretend to like study is immaterial; but\nyou should, when you are in the presence of master, or in the presence\nof any one else, not do nothing else than find fault with people and\nmake fun of them, but behave just as if you were genuinely fond of\nstudy, so that you shouldn’t besides provoke your father so much to\nanger, and that he should before others have also a chance of saying\nsomething! ’In my family,’ he reflects within himself, ’generation after\ngeneration has been fond of books, but ever since I’ve had you, you\nhaven’t accomplished my expectations, and not only is it that you don’t\ncare about reading books,’–and this has already filled his heart with\nanger and vexation,–’but both before my face and behind my back, you\nutter all that stuff and nonsense, and give those persons, who have,\nthrough their knowledge of letters, attained high offices, the nickname\nof the “the salaried worms.” You also uphold that there’s no work\nexclusive (of the book where appears) “fathom spotless virtue;” and that\nall other books consist of foolish compilations, which owe their origin\nto former authors, who, unable themselves to expound the writings of\nConfucius, readily struck a new line and invented original notions.’ Now\nwith words like these, how can one wonder if master loses all patience,\nand if he does from time to time give you a thrashing! and what do you\nmake other people think of you?”",
        "“I won’t say these things again,” Pao-yü laughingly protested, “these\nare the reckless and silly absurdities of a time when I was young and\nhad no idea of the height of the heavens and the thickness of the earth;\nbut I’ll now no more repeat them. What else is there besides?”",
        "“It isn’t right that you should sneer at the bonzes and vilify the\nTaoist priests, nor mix cosmetics or prepare rouge,” Hsi Jen continued;\n“but there’s still another thing more important, you shouldn’t again\nindulge the bad habits of licking the cosmetic, applied by people on\ntheir lips, nor be fond of (girls dressed) in red!”",
        "“I’ll change in all this,” Pao-yü added by way of rejoinder; “I’ll\nchange in all this; and if there’s anything more be quick and tell me.”",
        "“There’s nothing more,” Hsi Jen observed; “but you must in everything\nexercise a little more diligence, and not indulge your caprices and\nallow your wishes to run riot, and you’ll be all right. And should you\ncomply to all these things in real earnest, you couldn’t carry me out,\neven in a chair with eight bearers.”",
        "“Well, if you do stay in here long enough,” Pao-yü remarked with a\nsmile, “there’s no fear as to your not having an eight-bearer-chair to\nsit in!”",
        "Hsi Jen gave a sardonic grin. “I don’t care much about it,” she replied;\n“and were I even to have such good fortune, I couldn’t enjoy such a\nright. But allowing I could sit in one, there would be no pleasure in\nit!”",
        "While these two were chatting, they saw Ch’iu Wen walk in. “It’s the\nthird watch of the night,” she observed, “and you should go to sleep.\nJust a few moments back your grandmother lady Chia and our lady sent a\nnurse to ask about you, and I replied that you were asleep.”",
        "Pao-yü bade her fetch a watch, and upon looking at the time, he found\nindeed that the hand was pointing at ten; whereupon rinsing his mouth\nagain and loosening his clothes, he retired to rest, where we will leave\nhim without any further comment.",
        "The next day, Hsi Jen got up as soon as it was dawn, feeling her body\nheavy, her head sore, her eyes swollen, and her limbs burning like fire.\nShe managed however at first to keep up, an effort though it was, but as\nsubsequently she was unable to endure the strain, and all she felt\ndisposed to do was to recline, she therefore lay down in her clothes on\nthe stove-couch. Pao-yü hastened to tell dowager lady Chia, and the\ndoctor was sent for, who, upon feeling her pulse and diagnosing her\ncomplaint, declared that there was nothing else the matter with her than\na chill, which she had suddenly contracted, that after she had taken a\ndose or two of medicine, it would be dispelled, and that she would be\nquite well. After he had written the prescription and taken his\ndeparture, some one was despatched to fetch the medicines, which when\nbrought were properly decocted. As soon as she had swallowed a dose,\nPao-yü bade her cover herself with her bed-clothes so as to bring on\nperspiration; while he himself came into Tai-yü’s room to look her up.\nTai-yü was at this time quite alone, reclining on her bed having a\nmidday siesta, and the waiting-maids having all gone out to attend to\nwhatever they pleased, the whole room was plunged in stillness and\nsilence. Pao-yü raised the embroidered soft thread portiere and walked\nin; and upon espying Tai-yü in the room fast asleep, he hurriedly\napproached her and pushing her: “Dear cousin,” he said, “you’ve just had\nyour meal, and are you asleep already?” and he kept on calling “Tai-yü\"\ntill he woke her out of her sleep.",
        "Perceiving that it was Pao-yü, “You had better go for a stroll,” Tai-yü\nurged, “for the day before yesterday I was disturbed the whole night,\nand up to this day I haven’t had rest enough to get over the fatigue. My\nwhole body feels languid and sore.”",
        "“This languor and soreness,” Pao-yü rejoined, “are of no consequence;\nbut if you go on sleeping you’ll be feeling very ill; so I’ll try and\ndistract you, and when we’ve dispelled this lassitude, you’ll be all\nright.”",
        "Tai-yü closed her eyes. “I don’t feel any lassitude,” she explained,\n“all I want is a little rest; and you had better go elsewhere and come\nback after romping about for a while.”",
        "“Where can I go?” Pao-yü asked as he pushed her. “I’m quite sick and\ntired of seeing the others.”",
        "At these words, Tai-yü burst out laughing with a sound of Ch’ih. “Well!\nsince you wish to remain here,” she added, “go over there and sit down\nquietly, and let’s have a chat.”",
        "“I’ll also recline,” Pao-yü suggested.",
        "“Well, then, recline!” Tai-yü assented.",
        "“There’s no pillow,” observed Pao-yü, “so let us lie on the same\npillow.”",
        "“What nonsense!” Tai-yü urged, “aren’t those pillows outside? get one\nand lie on it.”",
        "Pao-yü walked into the outer apartment, and having looked about him, he\nreturned and remarked with a smile: “I don’t want those, they may be,\nfor aught I know, some dirty old hag’s.”",
        "Tai-yü at this remark opened her eyes wide, and as she raised herself\nup: “You’re really,” she exclaimed laughingly, “the evil star of my\nexistence! here, please recline on this pillow!” and as she uttered\nthese words, she pushed her own pillow towards Pao-yü, and, getting up\nshe went and fetched another of her own, upon which she lay her head in\nsuch a way that both of them then reclined opposite to each other. But\nTai-yü, upon turning up her eyes and looking, espied on Pao-yü’s cheek\non the left side of his face, a spot of blood about the size of a\nbutton, and speedily bending her body, she drew near to him, and rubbing\nit with her hand, she scrutinised it closely. “Whose nail,” she went on\nto inquire, “has scratched this open?”",
        "Pao-yü with his body still reclining withdrew from her reach, and as he\ndid so, he answered with a smile: “It isn’t a scratch; it must, I\npresume, be simply a drop, which bespattered my cheek when I was just\nnow mixing and clarifying the cosmetic paste for them.”",
        "Saying this, he tried to get at his handkerchief to wipe it off; but\nTai-yü used her own and rubbed it clean for him, while she observed: “Do\nyou still give your mind to such things? attend to them you may; but\nmust you carry about you a placard (to make it public)? Though uncle\nmayn’t see it, were others to notice it, they would treat it as a\nstrange occurrence and a novel bit of news, and go and tell him to curry\nfavour, and when it has reached uncle’s ear, we shall all again not come\nout clean, and provoke him to anger.”",
        "Pao-yü did not in the least heed what she said, being intent upon\nsmelling a subtle scent which, in point of fact, emanated from Tai-yü’s\nsleeve, and when inhaled inebriated the soul and paralysed the bones.\nWith a snatch, Pao-yü laid hold of Tai-yü’s sleeve meaning to see what\nobject was concealed in it; but Tai-yü smilingly expostulated: “At such\na time as this,” she said, “who keeps scents about one?”",
        "“Well, in that case,” Pao-yü rejoined with a smirking face, “where does\nthis scent come from?”",
        "“I myself don’t know,” Tai-yü replied; “I presume it must be, there’s no\nsaying, some scent in the press which has impregnated the clothes.”",
        "“It doesn’t follow,” Pao-yü added, as he shook his head; “the fumes of\nthis smell are very peculiar, and don’t resemble the perfume of\nscent-bottles, scent-balls, or scented satchets!”",
        "“Is it likely that I have, like others, Buddhistic disciples,” Tai-yü\nasked laughing ironically, “or worthies to give me novel kinds of\nscents? But supposing there is about me some peculiar scent, I haven’t,\nat all events, any older or younger brothers to get the flowers, buds,\ndew, and snow, and concoct any for me; all I have are those common\nscents, that’s all.”",
        "“Whenever I utter any single remark,” Pao-yü urged with a grin, “you at\nonce bring up all these insinuations; but unless I deal with you\nseverely, you’ll never know what stuff I’m made of; but from henceforth\nI’ll no more show you any grace!”",
        "As he spoke, he turned himself over, and raising himself, he puffed a\ncouple of breaths into both his hands, and hastily stretching them out,\nhe tickled Tai-yü promiscuously under her armpits, and along both sides.\nTai-yü had never been able to stand tickling, so that when Pao-yü put\nout his two hands and tickled her violently, she forthwith giggled to\nsuch an extent that she could scarcely gasp for breath. “If you still go\non teasing me,” she shouted, “I’ll get angry with you!”",
        "Pao-yü then kept his hands off, and as he laughed, “Tell me,” he asked,\n“will you again come out with all those words or not?”",
        "“I daren’t do it again,” Tai-yü smiled and adjusted her hair; adding\nwith another laugh: “I may have peculiar scents, but have you any ’warm’\nscents?”",
        "Pao-yü at this question, could not for a time unfold its meaning: “What\n’warm’ scent?” he therefore asked.",
        "Tai-yü nodded her head and smiled deridingly. “How stupid! what a fool!\"\nshe sighed; “you have jade, and another person has gold to match with\nyou, and if some one has ’cold’ scent, haven’t you any ’warm’ scent as a\nset-off?”",
        "Pao-yü at this stage alone understood the import of her remark.",
        "“A short while back you craved for mercy,” Pao-yü observed smilingly,\n“and here you are now going on talking worse than ever;” and as he spoke\nhe again put out his hands.",
        "“Dear cousin,” Tai-yü speedily implored with a smirk, “I won’t venture\nto do it again.”",
        "“As for letting you off,” Pao-yü remarked laughing, “I’ll readily let\nyou off, but do allow me to take your sleeve and smell it!” and while\nuttering these words, he hastily pulled the sleeve, and pressing it\nagainst his face, kept on smelling it incessantly, whereupon Tai-yü drew\nher hand away and urged: “You must be going now!”",
        "“Though you may wish me to go, I can’t,” Pao-yü smiled, “so let us now\nlie down with all propriety and have a chat,” laying himself down again,\nas he spoke, while Tai-yü likewise reclined, and covered her face with\nher handkerchief. Pao-yü in a rambling way gave vent to a lot of\nnonsense, which Tai-yü did not heed, and Pao-yü went on to inquire: “How\nold she was when she came to the capital? what sights and antiquities\nshe saw on the journey? what relics and curiosities there were at Yang\nChou? what were the local customs and the habits of the people?”",
        "Tai-yü made no reply; and Pao-yü fearing lest she should go to sleep,\nand get ill, readily set to work to beguile her to keep awake. “Ai yah!\"\nhe exclaimed, “at Yang Chou, where your official residence is, has\noccurred a remarkable affair; have you heard about it?”",
        "Tai-yü perceiving that he spoke in earnest, that his words were correct\nand his face serious, imagined that what he referred to was a true\nstory, and she therefore inquired what it was?",
        "Pao-yü upon hearing her ask this question, forthwith suppressed a laugh,\nand, with a glib tongue, he began to spin a yarn. “At Yang Chou,” he\nsaid, “there’s a hill called the Tai hill; and on this hill stands a\ncave called the Lin Tzu.”",
        "“This must all be lies,” Tai-yü answered sneeringly, “as I’ve never\nbefore heard of such a hill.”",
        "“Under the heavens many are the hills and rivers,” Pao-yü rejoined, “and\nhow could you know them all? Wait until I’ve done speaking, when you\nwill be free to express your opinion!”",
        "“Go on then,” Tai-yü suggested, whereupon Pao-yü prosecuted his\nraillery. “In this Lin Tzu cave,” he said, “there was once upon a time a\nwhole swarm of rat-elves. In some year or other and on the seventh day\nof the twelfth moon, an old rat ascended the throne to discuss matters.\n’Tomorrow,’ he argued, ’is the eighth of the twelfth moon, and men in\nthe world will all be cooking the congee of the eighth of the twelfth\nmoon. We have now in our cave a short supply of fruits of all kinds, and\nit would be well that we should seize this opportunity to steal a few\nand bring them over.’ Drawing a mandatory arrow, he handed it to a\nsmall rat, full of aptitude, to go forward on a tour of inspection. The\nyoung rat on his return reported that he had already concluded his\nsearch and inquiries in every place and corner, and that in the temple\nat the bottom of the hill alone was the largest stock of fruits and\nrice. ’How many kinds of rice are there?’ the old rat ascertained, ’and\nhow many species of fruits?’ ’Rice and beans,’ the young rat rejoined,\n’how many barns-full there are, I can’t remember; but in the way of\nfruits there are five kinds: 1st, red dates; 2nd, chestnuts; 3rd, ground\nnuts; 4th, water caltrops, and 5th, scented taros.’ At this report the\nold rat was so much elated that he promptly detailed rats to go forth;\nand as he drew the mandatory arrow, and inquired who would go and steal\nthe rice, a rat readily received the order and went off to rob the rice.\nDrawing another mandatory arrow, he asked who would go and abstract the\nbeans, when once more a rat took over the arrow and started to steal the\nbeans; and one by one subsequently received each an arrow and started on\nhis errand. There only remained the scented taros, so that picking again\na mandatory arrow, he ascertained who would go and carry away the taros:\nwhereupon a very puny and very delicate rat was heard to assent. ’I\nwould like,’ he said, ’to go and steal the scented taros.’ The old rat\nand all the swarm of rats, upon noticing his state, feared that he would\nnot be sufficiently expert, and apprehending at the same time that he\nwas too weakly and too devoid of energy, they one and all would not\nallow him to proceed. ’Though I be young in years and though my frame be\ndelicate,’ the wee rat expostulated, ’my devices are unlimited, my talk\nis glib and my designs deep and farseeing; and I feel convinced that, on\nthis errand, I shall be more ingenious in pilfering than any of them.’\n’How could you be more ingenious than they?’ the whole company of rats\nasked. ’I won’t,’ explained the young rat, ’follow their example, and go\nstraight to work and steal, but by simply shaking my body, and\ntransforming myself, I shall metamorphose myself into a taro, and roll\nmyself among the heap of taros, so that people will not be able to\ndetect me, and to hear me; whereupon I shall stealthily, by means of the\nmagic art of dividing my body into many, begin the removal, and little\nby little transfer the whole lot away, and will not this be far more\ningenious than any direct pilfering or forcible abstraction?’ After the\nwhole swarm of rats had listened to what he had to say, they, with one\nvoice, exclaimed: ’Excellent it is indeed, but what is this art of\nmetamorphosis we wonder? Go forth you may, but first transform yourself\nand let us see you.’ At these words the young rat laughed. ’This isn’t a\nhard task!’ he observed, ’wait till I transform myself.’",
        "“Having done speaking, he shook his body and shouted out ’transform,’\nwhen he was converted into a young girl, most beauteous and with a most\nlovely face.",
        "“’You’ve transformed yourself into the wrong thing,’ all the rats\npromptly added deridingly; ’you said that you were to become a fruit,\nand how is it that you’ve turned into a young lady?’",
        "“The young rat in its original form rejoined with a sneering smile: ’You\nall lack, I maintain, experience of the world; what you simply are aware\nof is that this fruit is the scented taro, but have no idea that the\nyoung daughter of Mr. Lin, of the salt tax, is, in real truth, a genuine\nscented taro.’”",
        "Tai-yü having listened to this story, turned herself round and raising\nherself, she observed laughing, while she pushed Pao-yü: “I’ll take that\nmouth of yours and pull it to pieces! Now I see that you’ve been\nimposing upon me.”",
        "With these words on her lips, she readily gave him a pinch, and Pao-yü\nhastened to plead for mercy. “My dear cousin,” he said, “spare me; I\nwon’t presume to do it again; and it’s when I came to perceive this\nperfume of yours, that I suddenly bethought myself of this old story.”",
        "“You freely indulge in abusing people,” Tai-yü added with a smile, “and\nthen go on to say that it’s an old story.”",
        "But hardly had she concluded this remark before they caught sight of\nPao-ch’ai walk in. “Who has been telling old stories?” she asked with a\nbeaming face; “do let me also hear them.”",
        "Tai-yü pressed her at once into a seat. “Just see for yourself who else\nbesides is here!” she smiled; “he goes in for profuse abuses and then\nmaintains that it’s an old story!”",
        "“Is it indeed cousin Pao-yü?” Pao-ch’ai remarked. “Well, one can’t feel\nsurprised at his doing it; for many have ever been the stories stored up\nin his brain. The only pity is that when he should make use of old\nstories, he invariably forgets them! To-day, he can easily enough recall\nthem to mind, but in the stanza of the other night on the banana leaves,\nwhen he should have remembered them, he couldn’t after all recollect\nwhat really stared him in the face! and while every one else seemed so\ncool, he was in such a flurry that he actually perspired! And yet, at\nthis moment, he happens once again to have a memory!”",
        "At these words, Tai-yü laughed. “O-mi-to-fu!” she exclaimed. “You are\nindeed my very good cousin! But you’ve also (to Pao-yü) come across your\nmatch. And this makes it clear that requital and retribution never fail\nor err.”",
        "She had just reached this part of her sentence, when in Pao-yü’s rooms\nwas heard a continuous sound of wrangling; but as what transpired is not\nyet known, the ensuing chapter will explain.",
