        "They of Genoa tell with a shrug how in the old days Cristofer\nColombo whom men called the Dreamer left Dame Colombo to go in\nsearch of the land of his imagining.",
        "And the tale tells how, on a twilight Thursday, Colombo walked\nalone on the edge of a doubtful wood, and viewed many things not\nsalutary to notice. And there came to him one who was as\nperversely tall as a certain unmentionable object and bearded in\na manner it is not convenient to describe.",
        "But Colombo set about that which the stranger said was necessary\nand when he had finished he drank the contents of the curious\nskull as had been foretold on a certain All-Saints day. Then it\nwas that the stranger spoke.",
        "“Whom are you”, said he, “to be thus wandering in the very\nunspeakable forest of the very unnamable sorcerer Thyrston?”",
        "Said Colombo, “I have heard of this Thyrston.  And while I do not\ncriticize, yet I cannot entirely agree with your improper use of\nthe pronoun WHOM, and oh my dear sir”, said Colombo, “those two\nVERYS would surely—oh, most surely—be mentioned in ’The Conning\nTower’.”",
        "“Eh!” said Thyrston, frowning.",
        "“I allude”, said Colombo, “to the scribbling of a certain Adams\nwith whom you are doubtless familiar, and of course, my dear\nThyrston”, said Colombo, “I spoke only jestingly, for I am\nCristofer Colombo whom men call the Dreamer, and I go in search\nof the land of my imagining and it is truly a pleasure to meet\nthe greatest sorcerer since Ckellyr, and how”, said Colombo, “is\ndear Mrs. Thyrston?”",
        "Then Thyrston showed Colombo what was written on the insecure\nparchment. It frightened Colombo a little, but he assented.  And\nwhen the sorcerer had borrowed a silk hat and a gold watch he\ncaused the skies to darken and Colombo saw that which men refuse\nto believe.",
        "“But, oh, now really sir”, said Colombo, “that is indeed\nextremely clever and I do wish that the children were here to see\nit and would you mind, my dear Thyrston”, said Colombo, “doing\nthat egg trick again?”",
        "Then Thyrston showed Colombo that he had nothing up either sleeve\nand after an interval he consented to teach Colombo the secret of\nhis conjuring.",
        "“Why now to be sure”, said Colombo, after he had thoroughly\nmastered the trick, “that is indeed quite simple and I am sorry I\nbroke those four eggs by mistake in your silk hat, and while I do\nnot wish to appear oversensitive, do you not think, my dear\nThyrston”, said Colombo, “that the trick would go just as well\nwithout those abominable jokes about married life?”",
        "“My dear sir”, said Thyrston, “those jokes have been used by\nevery conjurer since Merlin, and while perhaps without them your\ntrick would work, yet I have never heard of it being done and I\nhave found”, said Thyrston, “that in sorcery the best results are\nobtained by doing the customary thing.”",
        "“Which only goes to show”, said Colombo, “that sorcery is\nsomewhat akin to business, and now that I think of it”, said\nColombo, “I believe that the term wizard of industry is perhaps\nnot entirely a misnomer.”",
        "Thus it was that Colombo took leave of Thyrston, and the tale\ntells how on Walburga’s Eve he came to the court of King\nFerdinand and Queen Isabel.  And as he entered one met him who\nwas not unpleasing to the eye, and she was weeping.  And, as it\nwas somewhat dark, Colombo decided to comfort her.",
        "“Now, do you tell me, my dear”, said Colombo, after an interval,\n“why it is you weep, for I am Colombo whom men call the Dreamer,\nand I go in search of the land of my imagining, and I think”,\nsaid Colombo, “that you have most remarkably lovely eyes.”",
        "“Oh messire”, said the lady, “I weep because it is this evening\nthat I am to entertain the ladies of our Progress Literary Club,\nand Donna Margarita whom men call the Spanish Omelet, but who\nreally, messire, has a lovely voice, was going to sing ’The\nRosary’ and now she has a cold and cannot sing, and King\nFerdinand is coming, and oh, messire, what”, said the lady,\n“shall I do?”",
        "“Why now, truly”, said Colombo, “in Genoa it was the judgment of\nall the really musically intelligent ladies, except perhaps my\nwife, that I sang not an unpleasing baritone, and while I do not\nknow the song to which you refer, yet I have devoted most of my\nlife to the composition of a poem concerning the land of my\nimagining which might well be sung and besides that”, said\nColombo, “I can do a most remarkable egg trick.”",
        "So it was that Colombo became for a short time not undeservedly\nthe life of the Progress Literary Club party. And the tale tells\nhow, after a paper by Donna Violet Balboa on “Spanish\nArchitecture—Then and Now”, Colombo sang to them the song of the\nland of Colombo’s imagining. And poignantly beautiful was the\nsong, for in it was the beauty of a poet’s dream, and the eternal\nloveliness of that vision which men have glimpsed in all ages if\never so faintly. And when he had finished, the eyes of Colombo\nwere wet with tears, for into this poem had he woven the dreams\nof his disillusionment. And somewhat ironical to Colombo was the\napplause of those fine ladies who did not at all understand.",
        "“Now that is a pretty song”, said King Ferdinand, “and do you\ntell us, Colombo, how one may get to this land, so that I may\nextend the borders of my most Catholic Kingdom and spread the\nteachings of the true faith, for to bring the world under the\nblessed influence of my religion is my only purpose, and really\nnow”, said King Ferdinand, “is there as much gold there as you\ndescribe?”",
        "“Ah, King Ferdinand”, replied Colombo, “there is more gold than\never I can tell, and I see only too plainly how grievously you\nsuffer to think that perhaps these people are living in ignorance\nof the true faith. And I could ask nothing better than that King\nFerdinand give me ships in which I may sail to the westward and\ncome at last to the land of my imagining. This I would do in\norder that the blessed soldiers of King Ferdinand who will follow\nme may show to the inhabitants of my discovered land the grievous\nerrors of their ways and bring them at last to a realization of\nthe true faith which has been so helpful to our own dear Spain,\nand”, added Colombo, “our gracious sovereign Ferdinand.”",
        "And droll it was to Colombo to think what might possibly happen\nwere King Ferdinand to take his dream seriously or were the King\nperhaps to be informed as to the true meaning of Colombo’s\nsubtleties.",
        "“Well, now”, said King Ferdinand, “of course, to fit out such an\nexpedition would require great expense, my dear Colombo—great\nexpense. And, of course, you know, Colombo, that when investors\ncan buy Inquisition 4 1/4’s for 89 it would be extremely\ndifficult to raise the money for such a speculative project—oh,\nextremely difficult. And then you must consider the present\ndepression—tell me now, Colombo”, said King Ferdinand, “how long\ndo you think this depression will last, for I seek, above all\nthings, a return to healthy normalcy.”",
        "“Well, truly”, replied Colombo, “that would be most difficult to\nsay. I note that on Rodigruez Babsyn’s last chart—”",
        "“I wish this Babsyn and his charts were in hell”, said King\nFerdinand, “for it was he who advised me to sell Queen Isabel’s\nsilver holdings. But it occurs to me, Colombo, that in connection\nwith this land-of-gold scheme of yours, you mentioned something\nabout sailing to the westward. Now Colombo, that would be a\ndistinct disadvantage when it came to marketing the bonds, for as\nyou must already know, one cannot sail to the west without\nencountering fierce and enormous monsters who swallow, I am told,\nwhole ships at a gulp.”",
        "“Now as to that”, said Colombo, somewhat embarrassed at the turn\nof the conversation for WEST had merely happened to better suit\nthe rhymes of his poem, “you may be right, and I should not go so\nfar as to say you are wrong, but still at the same time”, said\nColombo, “is there any gentleman in the audience who can lend me\nan egg and a silk hat?”",
        "And when an unmentionable egg and a doubtful silk hat had been\nproduced in a manner which it is not convenient to mention\nColombo rolled up both his sleeves and spoke the magic speech as\nhe had learned it on a certain Thursday from the sorcerer\nThyrston.",
        "“Ladies and gentlemen”, said Colombo, “I have here a common\nhousehold egg which I shall now ask the ushers to pass among you\nso you may see for yourself that there are no wires or strings\nattached. While this is being done, ladies and gentlemen, I wish\nthat three of you would step up on the stage.  Any three—don’t\nbe bashful girls— I won’t hurt you.  Won’t that couple over\nthere kindly oblige me— that married couple—no, folks, I guess\nthey aren’t married either— they look too happy.”",
        "Very painful it was to Colombo to hear these horrible jokes\ncoming from his mouth, but Thyrston had quoted the authority of\nall successful sorcerers and not for anything would Colombo have\nhad his trick a failure.",
        "“Now ladies and gentlemen”, said Colombo, “I am going to ask this\nlady and these two gentlemen if they will be so good as to see if\nthey can take this little egg and make it stand on end without\nany support.”",
        "And very droll it was to see the unsuccessful attempts which the\nthree made. Finally Colombo said:",
        "“Now ladies and gentlemen, I want you to watch me closely. I put\nthe silk hat on my head—thus.  And I take the egg in my right\nhand—thus.  Now, if this young lady will be kind enough to hold\nmy left hand—I hope that her best fellow doesn’t mind letting\nsuch a pretty girl hold my hand—it’s lucky my wife can’t see me,\nthough—a friend said to me the other day, ’Who was that lady I\nseen you with?’ and I said, ’That wasn’t no lady, that was my\nwife’. Now ladies and gentlemen I take this egg, and in order to\nmake it stand upright I tap one end gently— thus against the\ntable until that end is flattened— and then, presto—the egg\nstands upright.  Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you one and all\nfor your kind attention.”",
        "Thus it was that Colombo impressed King Ferdinand and his court\nwith his profound knowledge of geography.  Next the tale tells\nhow there came to Colombo on Michaelmas Eve one sent by Queen\nIsabel, And when Colombo had buckled on his sword Impavide he\nfollowed the messenger through winding corridors and came at last\nto the chamber of the Queen.  And as he knelt before her it\nseemed to Colombo that never before had he seen such\nunforgettable beauty as shone in the eyes of Queen Isabel.  Yes,\ntruly, this was the loveliest girl that Colombo had ever\nimagined.",
        "“Now do you rise”, said she, “and you and I shall have a nice\nchat alone here together, and you can tell me all about geography\nof which I am oh, frightfully ignorant.  In truth”, said she, “I\nhave tried to get Ferdinand to instruct me, but I fear”, said\nQueen Isabel, “that Ferdinand does not understand me.”",
        "So Colombo instructed Queen Isabel in the fundamentals of\ngeography. And after a while he spoke.",
        "“Now many people”, said Colombo, “believe that the earth is flat,\nbut”, said Colombo, “such is not at all the case.”",
        "And after an interval Colombo said, “There, my dear, do you not\nsee how ridiculous it is to suppose that the earth is anything\nbut round?”",
        "“Why surely, sire”, said Queen Isabel, “you make it appear very\nround. And I wonder that I had not thought of that before.  And I\nthink”, said Queen Isabel, “that geography is a most fascinating\nsubject and oh, messire Colombo”, said the Queen, “you must come\nand instruct me often.”",
        "Thus it was that Colombo became Royal Geographer.  And the tale\ntells how after a while various whisperings came to King\nFerdinand of his queen’s curious enthusiasm for study.",
        "“Now about this geography”, said King Ferdinand one evening to\nthe Queen, “I am, my dear, indeed glad to see you take an\ninterest in such an important study and I have arranged”, said\nthe King, “to have your tutoring in the future done by Father\nBernadino who has had fifty-two years’ experience at the\nUniversity, and your lessons”, said the King, “will commence\ntomorrow.”",
        "Said the Queen, “How can I thank you enough, dear Ferdinand, for\nyour untiring interest in my welfare.  For I have been struggling\nalong in my study of geography with a horribly dull clod whose\nname”, said the Queen, “I cannot remember.”",
        "“Was it, by any chance, Colombo?” asked the King.",
        "“Perhaps”, said the Queen.  “But I am oh so glad to be rid of\nhim.” And indeed so great was the happiness of Queen Isabel that\nher pillow that night was wet with tears.",
        "But King Ferdinand was an unusually efficient king, and he spared\nno pains in his craving for normalcy.  So it was that the next\nday he called to him the man who had chanced to be Royal\nGeographer before the coup d’oeuf of Colombo.",
        "“Now tell me”, said the King, “is there any chance that a man who\nsails to the westward will ever return?”",
        "“None, your Majesty”, said the ex-Royal Geographer.  “For many\nhave tried and horrible are the tales which they tell of demons\nand monsters lying in wait for the ships of men. And I should say\ndefinitely, oh King”, said he, “that whoever sails to the\nwestward will never return.”",
        "And the tale tells how that afternoon Colombo stood before King\nFerdinand.  And very strange to Colombo was the enthusiasm which\nburned in the King’s otherwise somewhat fishlike eye.",
        "“For know you, Colombo”, the King was saying, “that God has\nspoken to me and commanded me to save from the fires of hell the\ninhabitants of those golden lands of which you sang. And to you,\nmy dear Colombo, is to be given the chance which you so ardently\ndesire.  For I have this day purchased three ships which await\nyour command, and within a week you should be well on your way on\nthis glorious mission for God and for Spain, and”, said the King,\n“I might add that the Queen, too, is much interested in this\nvoyage and has even been persuaded to dispose of her jewels in\norder that you may make haste.”",
        "“Such instant obedience to the will of God”, said Colombo, “and\nsuch fine enthusiasm to further His kingdom on earth, does your\nMajesties great credit. And I shall indeed congratulate the\ninhabitants of this to-be-discovered land for their good fortune\nin obtaining such a devout King.”",
        "And the tale tells how that night Colombo took leave of Queen\nIsabel.  “Now do not weep, oh Queen”, said he, “for I am only\nColombo whom men call the Dreamer, and I go in search of the land\nof my imagining, and perhaps”, said Colombo, “I shall return.\"\nBut they tell how Queen Isabel refused to be comforted for many\nand many a day.  And unexplainably curious to Father Bernadino\nwas his absolute and complete failure as a royal instructor in\ngeography, for Father Bernadino had taught for fifty-two years at\nthe University.",
        "And so it was that Colombo sat alone in the cabin of the ship\nwhich carried him towards the land of his imagining. And strange\nand somewhat fearsome it was to the sailors to see their captain\nsitting thus motionless night after night, for already had they\nleft the Canaries far behind and some there were who said that a\nmadman commanded their ship, and others who whispered of horrible\nmonsters in these western seas.",
        "And the tale tells how one night Colombo observed across his\ntable one who had not been sitting there a moment before and\nwhose hair was strangely red.",
        "“Well now, truly, sir”, said Colombo, “This is very curious. For\nI do not remember seeing you among the crew nor were you ever at\nthe court, and on the whole”, said Colombo, “your red hair and\nyour sneering grin interrupt my dreams, and dreams”, said\nColombo, “are all that I have left.”",
        "“For know you, sir”, continued he to the stranger who did not\nspeak, “that on this earth man has been able to endure only by\nplaying the ape to his dreams.  And in every generation”, said\nColombo, “there have been those who dreamed of beautiful things\nand in every age there have been those who caught some glimpse of\nthat perfect beauty which the Greeks call Helen, and to have seen\nHelen”, said Colombo, “is to have been touched with divine and\nunbearable madness.”",
        "And it became strangely quiet in the cabin as Colombo continued:",
        "“And those authors who wrote perfectly of beautiful dreams”, said\nhe, “will, perchance, endure, and those who saw only men as they\nare, will perish—for so has it been in the past and so will it\nbe in the future. All of which”, said Colombo, “is a rather\ntiresome and pedantic excuse for the fact that I am about to read\nyou my own poem.”",
        "And Colombo read to the stranger the dream of the land of\nColombo’s imagining, and when he had finished the stranger smiled\nand shook his head sadly.",
        "“Come, now,” said Colombo, somewhat hurt.  “Do not, I pray you,\npretend to like it unless you really do. Of course it is not at\nall the kind of thing that will sell, is it— and the metre must\nbe patched up in places, don’t you think? And some of the most\nbeautiful passages would never be permitted by the censor—but\nstill—” and Colombo paused hopefully, for it was Colombo’s poem\nand into it he had poured the heart of his life and it seemed to\nhim now, more than ever, a beautiful thing.",
        "The stranger handed Colombo a book.",
        "“There”, said he, “is the land of your imagining”, and in his\neyes gleamed a curious sardonic mockery.",
        "And Colombo read the book.  And when he had finished his face was\ngrey as are old ashes in ancient urns, and about the mouth of him\nwhom men called the Dreamer were curious hard lines.",
        "“Now, by Heaven”, said Colombo brandishing his sword Impavide,\n“you lie. And your Gopher Prairie is a lie.  And you are all, all\ncontemptible, you who dip your pens in tracing ink and seek to\nbanish beautiful dreams from the world.”",
        "But the red-haired stranger had vanished and Colombo found that\nhe was alone and to Colombo the world seemed cheerless and as a\nplace that none has lived in for a long time.",
        "“Now this is curious”, mused Colombo, “for I have evidently been\ndreaming and a more horrible dream have I never had, and I\nthink”, said Colombo, “that while all this quite certainly did\nnot actually take place, yet that grinning red head has upset me\nhorribly and on the whole”, said Colombo, “I believe the safest\ncourse would be to put back at once for Spain, for certainly I\nhave no desire to take the remotest chance of discovering\nanything which may in the least resemble that Gopher Prairie.”",
        "And the tale tells that as Colombo started for the deck in order\nthat he might give the signal for the return to Spain, there came\nacross the water from one of the other ships the faint cry of a\nsailor. And the sailor was waving his hat and shouting, “Land\nHo!”",
        "Thus it was that Cristofer Colombo became the discoverer of the\nland of his imagining, and as he stood on the deck Colombo mused.",
        "“Now this is a sorrowful jest and a very unfair jest that is\nhappening,” said he.  “For I who have dreamed a beautiful dream\nof the land of my imagining will quite probably henceforth be\nknown only as the discoverer of what will turn out to be merely\none more hideous and stupid country.” And tears came to the eyes\nof Colombo, for on the waves behind him floated the torn and\nscattered pages of the poem which sang the imagined vision of\nBeauty of him whom men long and long ago called the\nDreamer.",
        "Thus it was in the old days.",
        "There is a lesson for us all in this beautiful story of how\nColumbus realized his ambition to be a great discoverer.",
        "Men called Columbus a Dreamer—but that is just what folks once\nsaid about Thomas A. Edison and Henry Ford.",
        "The world has a place for Dreamers—if they are Practical\nDreamers.",
        "Columbus was ambitious.  Ambition is a great thing if it is\nunselfish ambition.  By unselfish I mean for the greatest good of\nthe greatest number.  Shakespeare, the great teacher, shows us in\n“Macbeth” what happens to the selfishly ambitious man.",
        "Columbus got ahead by paying attention to small details. \nWhatever he did, he did to the best of his ability.  Even when\nengaged in teaching geography to the Queen, Columbus was the best\ngeography teacher he knew how to be. And before long he was made\nRoyal Geographer.",
        "In our daily lives let us all resolve to be good teachers of\ngeography. We may not all become Royal Geographers—but there\nwill be to us the lasting satisfaction of having done our best. \nAnd that, as a greater than I has said, is “more precious than\nrubies—yea, than much fine gold”.",
