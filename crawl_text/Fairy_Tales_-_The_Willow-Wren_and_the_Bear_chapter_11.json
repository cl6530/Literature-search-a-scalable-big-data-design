        "Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,\nand the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said:\n’Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ’That is the King\nof birds,’ said the wolf, ’before whom we must bow down.’ In reality\nthe bird was the willow-wren. ’IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ’I\nshould very much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’\n’That is not done quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ’you\nmust wait until the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived\nwith some food in her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began\nto feed their young ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but\nthe wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said: ’No, you must wait\nuntil the lord and lady Queen have gone away again.’ So they took\nstock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away. The bear,\nhowever, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and when a\nshort time had passed, went to it again. The King and Queen had just\nflown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying there.\n’Is that the royal palace?’ cried the bear; ’it is a wretched palace,\nand you are not King’s children, you are disreputable children!’ When\nthe young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and screamed:\n’No, that we are not! Our parents are honest people! Bear, you will\nhave to pay for that!’",
        "The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\nholes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream,\nand when their parents again brought food they said: ’We will not so\nmuch as touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until\nyou have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear\nhas been here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ’Be easy,\nhe shall be punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the\nbear’s cave, and called in: ’Old Growler, why have you insulted my\nchildren? You shall suffer for it–we will punish you by a bloody\nwar.’ Thus war was announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals\nwere summoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every\nother animal the earth contained. And the willow-wren summoned\neverything which flew in the air, not only birds, large and small, but\nmidges, and hornets, bees and flies had to come.",
        "When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out\nspies to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat,\nwho was the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was\nassembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the\npassword was to be announced. There stood the bear, and he called the\nfox before him and said: ’Fox, you are the most cunning of all\nanimals, you shall be general and lead us.’ ’Good,’ said the fox, ’but\nwhat signal shall we agree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said:\n’I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red\nfeathers. When I lift my tail up quite high, all is going well, and\nyou must charge; but if I let it hang down, run away as fast as you\ncan.’ When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and revealed\neverything, down to the minutest detail, to the willow-wren. When day\nbroke, and the battle was to begin, all the four-footed animals came\nrunning up with such a noise that the earth trembled. The willow-wren\nwith his army also came flying through the air with such a humming,\nand whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and\non both sides they advanced against each other. But the willow-wren\nsent down the hornet, with orders to settle beneath the fox’s tail,\nand sting with all his might. When the fox felt the first string, he\nstarted so that he one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and\nstill kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was\nforced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no\nlonger, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When the animals\nsaw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each into his\nhole, and the birds had won the battle.",
        "Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:\n’Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won\nthe battle!’ But the young wrens said: ’We will not eat yet, the bear\nmust come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are\nhonourable children, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren\nflew to the bear’s hole and cried: ’Growler, you are to come to the\nnest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your\nbody shall be broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear,\nand begged their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were\nsatisfied, and sat down together and ate and drank, and made merry\ntill quite late into the night.",
