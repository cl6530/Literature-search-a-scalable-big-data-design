        "It was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to\nDr. Jekyll’s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and\ncarried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had\nonce been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known\nas the laboratory or the dissecting-rooms. The doctor had bought\nthe house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and his own\ntastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the\ndestination of the block at the bottom of the garden. It was the\nfirst time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his\nfriend’s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless structure with\ncuriosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness\nas he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now\nlying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus,\nthe floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and\nthe light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further\nend, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the\ndoctor’s cabinet. It was a large room, fitted round with glass\npresses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a\nbusiness table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty\nwindows barred with iron. A fire burned in the grate; a lamp was\nset lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog\nbegan to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr.\nJekyll, looking deadly sick. He did not rise to meet his visitor,\nbut held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice.",
        "“And now,” said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, “you\nhave heard the news?”",
        "The doctor shuddered.” They were crying it in the square,” he said.\n“I heard them in my dining-room.”",
        "“One word,” said the lawyer. “Carew was my client, but so are you,\nand I want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to\nhide this fellow?”",
        "“Utterson, I swear to God, “ cried the doctor,” I swear to God I\nwill never set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am\ndone with him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does\nnot want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is\nquite safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.” ",
        "The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend’s feverish\nmanner. “You seem pretty sure of him,” said he; “and for your sake, I hope you may be right.\nIf it came to a trial, your name might appear.”",
        "“I am quite sure of him,” replied Jekyll; “I have grounds for\ncertainty that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing\non which you may advise me. I have — I have received a letter; and\nI am at a loss whether I should show it to the police. I should like\nto leave it in your hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am\nsure; I have so great a trust in you.”",
        "“You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?” asked\nthe lawyer.",
        "“No,” said the other.” I cannot say that I care what becomes of\nHyde; I am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character,\nwhich this hateful business has rather exposed.”",
        "Utterson ruminated a while; he was surprised at his friend’s\nselfishness, and yet relieved by it. “Well,” said he, at last, “let\nme see the letter.”",
        "The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed “Edward\nHyde”: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer’s\nbenefactor, Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a\nthousand generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, As\nhe had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The\nlawyer liked this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the\nintimacy than he had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of\nhis past suspicions.",
        "“Have you the envelope?” he asked.",
        "“I burned it,” replied Jekyll,” before I thought what I was about.\nBut it bore no postmark. The note was handed in.”",
        "“Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?” asked Utterson.",
        "“I wish you to judge for me entirely,” was the reply. “I have lost\nconfidence in myself.”",
        "“Well, I shall consider,” returned the lawyer. “And now one word\nmore: it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that\ndisappearance?”",
        "The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness: he shut his\nmouth tight and nodded.",
        "“I knew it,” said Utterson. “He meant to murder you. You have had a\nfine escape.”",
        "“I have had what is far more to the purpose,” returned the doctor\nsolemnly: “I have had a lesson — O God, Utterson, what a lesson I\nhave had!” And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.",
        "On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with\nPoole. “By the by,” said he, “there was a letter handed in to-day:\nwhat was the messenger like?” But Poole was positive nothing had\ncome except by post;” and only circulars by that,” he added.",
        "This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the\nletter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had\nbeen written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently\njudged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,\nwere crying themselves hoarse along the footways: “Special edition.\nShocking murder of an M. P.” That was the funeral oration of one\nfriend and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest\nthe good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the\nscandal. It was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make;\nand self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing\nfor advice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought,\nit might be fished for.",
        "Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr.\nGuest, his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a\nnicely calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular\nold wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his\nhouse. The fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where\nthe lamps glimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and\nsmother of these fallen clouds, the procession of the town’s life\nwas still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a\nmighty wind. But the room was gay with firelight. In the bottle the\nacids were long ago resolved; the imperial dye had softened with\ntime, As the colour grows richer in stained windows; and the glow of\nhot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of London. Insensibly the lawyer melted.\nThere was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest;\nand he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant. Guest\nhad often been on business to the doctor’s; he knew Poole; he could\nscarce have failed to hear of Mr. Hyde’s familiarity about the\nhouse; he might draw conclusions: was it not as well, then, that he\nshould see a letter which put that mystery to rights? and above all\nsince Guest, being a great student and critic of handwriting, would\nconsider the step natural and obliging? The clerk, besides, was a\nman of counsel; he would scarce read so strange a document without\ndropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson might shape his\nfuture course.",
        "“This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,” he said.",
        "“Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,\"\nreturned Guest. “The man, of course, was mad.”",
        "“I should like to hear your views on that,” replied Utterson. “I\nhave a document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves,\nfor I scarce know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at\nthe best. But there it is; quite in your way a murderer’s\nautograph.”",
        "Guest’s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it\nwith passion. “No, sir,” he said: “not mad; but it is an odd hand.”",
        "“And by all accounts a very odd writer,” added the lawyer.",
        "Just then the servant entered with a note.",
        "“Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?” inquired the clerk. “I thought I\nknew the writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?”",
        "“Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?”",
        "“One moment. I thank you, sir\"; and the clerk laid the two sheets\nof paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. “Thank\nyou, sir,” he said at last, returning both; “it’s a very\ninteresting autograph.”",
        "There was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with\nhimself. “Why did you compare them, Guest?” he inquired suddenly.",
        "“Well, sir,” returned the clerk, “there’s a rather singular\nresemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only\ndifferently sloped.”",
        "“Rather quaint,” said Utterson.",
        "“It is, as you say, rather quaint,” returned Guest.",
        "“I wouldn’t speak of this note, you know,” said the master.",
        "“No, sir,” said the clerk. “I understand.”",
        "But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night than he locked the\nnote into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward.\n“What!” he thought.” Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!” And his\nblood ran cold in his veins.",
