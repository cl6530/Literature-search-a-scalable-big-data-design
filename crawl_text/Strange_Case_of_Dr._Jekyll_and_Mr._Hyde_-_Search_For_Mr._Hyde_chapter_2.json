        "That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre\nspirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of\na Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a\nvolume of some dry divinity on his reading-desk, until the clock of\nthe neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would\ngo soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night, however, as soon as\nthe cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his\nbusiness-room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private\npart of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll’s Will,\nand sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was\nholograph, for Mr. Utterson, though he took charge of it now that it\nwas made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of\nit; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry\nJekyll, M.D., D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were\nto pass into the hands of his “friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\"\nbut that in case of Dr. Jekyll’s “disappearance or unexplained absence for any period\nexceeding three calendar months,” the said Edward Hyde should step\ninto the said Henry Jekyll’s shoes without further delay and free\nfrom any burthen or obligation, beyond the payment of a few small\nsums to the members of the doctor’s household. This document had\nlong been the lawyer’s eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and\nas a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the\nfanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr.\nHyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was\nhis knowledge. It was already bad enough when the name was but a\nname of which he could learn no more. It was worse when it began to\nbe clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting,\ninsubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped\nup the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend.",
        "“I thought it was madness,” he said, as he replaced the obnoxious\npaper in the safe, “and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.”",
        "With that he blew out his candle, put on a great-coat, and set\nforth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of\nmedicine, where his friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and\nreceived his crowding patients. “If any one knows, it will be\nLanyon,” he had thought.",
        "The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the\ndoor to the dining-room where Dr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine.\nThis was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a\nshock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided\nmanner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up from his chair and\nwelcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was the way of the\nman, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine\nfeeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at school\nand college, both thorough respecters of themselves and of each\nother, and, what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed\neach other’s company.",
        "After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject\nwhich so disagreeably pre-occupied his mind.",
        "“I suppose, Lanyon,” said he “you and I must be the two oldest\nfriends that Henry Jekyll has?”",
        "“I wish the friends were younger,” chuckled Dr. Lanyon. “But I\nsuppose we are. And what of that? I see little of him now.” ",
        "Indeed?” said Utterson. “I thought you had a bond of common\ninterest.”",
        "“We had,” was the reply. “But it is more than ten years since Henry\nJekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in\nmind; and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for\nold sake’s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the man. Such unscientific\nbalderdash,” added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, “would have\nestranged Damon and Pythias.”",
        "This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr.\nUtterson. “They have only differed on some point of science,” he\nthought; and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the\nmatter of conveyancing), he even added: “It is nothing worse than\nthat!” He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure,\nand then approached the question he had come to put. “Did you ever\ncome across a protege of his — one Hyde?” he asked.",
        "“Hyde?” repeated Lanyon. “No. Never heard of him. Since my time.”",
        "That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back\nwith him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro,\nuntil the small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a\nnight of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness\nand besieged by questions.",
        "Six o ’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so\nconveniently near to Mr. Utterson’s dwelling, and still he was\ndigging at the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the\nintellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged,\nor rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness\nof the night and the curtained room, Mr. Enfield’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures. He would be aware\nof the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure\nof a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor’s;\nand then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down\nand passed on regardless of her screams. Or else he would see a room\nin a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling\nat his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the\ncurtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo!\nthere would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and\neven at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding. The figure\nin these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time\nhe dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through\nsleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more\nswiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted\ncity, and at every street-corner crush a child and leave her\nscreaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know\nit; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and\nmelted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and\ngrew apace in the lawyer’s mind a singularly strong, almost an\ninordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde.\nIf he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would\nlighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of\nmysterious things when well examined. He might see a reason for his friend’s\nstrange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even\nfor the startling clause of the will. At least it would be a face\nworth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a\nface which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the\nunimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred.",
        "From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\nby-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when\nbusiness was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of the\nfogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or\nconcourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.",
        "“If he be Mr. Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.”",
        "And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night;\nfrost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the\nlamps, unshaken, by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light\nand shadow. By ten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the\nby-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of\nLondon from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far;\ndomestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either\nside of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any\npassenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some\nminutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd, light footstep drawing near. In the course of his\nnightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect\nwith which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a\ngreat way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and\nclatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so\nsharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong,\nsuperstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry\nof the court.",
        "The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as\nthey turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from\nthe entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with.\nHe was small and very plainly dressed, and the look of him, even at\nthat distance, went somehow strongly against the watcher’s\ninclination. But he made straight for the door, crossing the\nroadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket\nlike one approaching home.",
        "Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he\npassed.” Mr. Hyde, I think?”",
        "Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his\nfear was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in\nthe face, he answered coolly enough: “That is my name. What do you\nwant?”",
        "“I see you are going in,” returned the lawyer. “I am an old friend\nof Dr. Jekyll’s — Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street — you must have heard my name; and meeting you\nso conveniently, I thought you might admit me.”",
        "“You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,” replied Mr. Hyde,\nblowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,\n“How did you know me?” he asked.",
        "“On your side,” said Mr. Utterson, “will you do me a favour?”",
        "“With pleasure,” replied the other. “What shall it be?”",
        "“Will you let me see your face?” asked the lawyer.",
        "Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden\nreflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair\nstared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. “Now I shall\nknow you again,” said Mr. Utterson.” It may be useful.”",
        "“Yes,” returned Mr. Hyde, “it is as well we have, met; and a\npropos, you should have my address.” And he gave a number of a\nstreet in Soho.",
        "“Good God!” thought Mr. Utterson,” can he, too, have been thinking\nof the will?” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted\nin acknowledgment of the address.",
        "“And now,” said the other, “how did you know me?”",
        "“By description,” was the reply.",
        "“Whose description?”",
        "“We have common friends, said Mr. Utterson.",
        "“Common friends?” echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely.” Who are\nthey?”",
        "“Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer.",
        "“He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger.” I did\nnot think you would have lied.”",
        "“Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.” ",
        "The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment,\nwith extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and\ndisappeared into the house.",
        "The lawyer stood a while when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of\ndisquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing\nevery step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in\nmental perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked,\nwas one of a class that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and\ndwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable\nmalformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to\nthe lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and\nboldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken\nvoice; all these were points against him, but not all of these\ntogether could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing, and\nfear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. “There must be something else,” said the perplexed gentleman. “There is something\nmore, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems\nhardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be the\nold story of Dr. Fell? or Is it the mere radiance of a foul soul\nthat thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent?\nThe last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read\nSatan’s signature upon a face, it Is on that of your new friend.”",
        "Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,\nhandsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high\nestate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of\nmen: map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers, and the agents of\nobscure enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was\nstill occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great\nair of wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness\nexcept for the fan-light, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A\nwell-dressed, elderly servant opened the door.",
        "Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?” asked the lawyer.",
        "“I will see, Mr. Utterson,” said Poole, admitting the visitor, as\nhe spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall, paved with\nflags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright,\nopen fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. “Will you\nwait here by the fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining room?”",
        "“Here, thank you,” said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on\nthe tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a\npet fancy of his friend the doctor’s; and Utterson himself was wont\nto speak of it as the pleasantest room in London. But to-night there\nwas a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his\nmemory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of\nlife; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in\nthe flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the\nuneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his\nrelief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll\nwas gone out.",
        "“I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting-room door, Poole,” he\nsaid. “Is that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?”",
        "“Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,” replied the servant. “Mr. Hyde\nhas a key.”",
        "“Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young\nman, Poole,” resumed the other musingly.",
        "“Yes, sir, he do indeed,” said Poole. “We have all orders to obey\nhim.”",
        "“I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?” asked Utterson.  ",
        "O, dear no, sir. He never dines here,” replied the butler. “Indeed\nwe see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and goes by the\nlaboratory.”",
        "“Well, good-night, Poole.”",
        "“Good-night, Mr. Utterson.” And the lawyer set out homeward with a\nvery heavy heart.” Poor Harry Jekyll,” he thought, “my mind\nmisgives me he is in deep waters! He was wild when he was young; a\nlong while ago to be sure; but in the law of God, there is no\nstatute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old\nsin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, PEDE\nCLAUDO, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the\nfault.” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded a while on\nhis own past, groping in all the corners of memory, lest by chance\nsome Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there.\nHis past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their\nlife with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the\nmany ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and\nfearful gratitude by the many that he had come so near to doing, yet\navoided. And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a\nspark of hope. “This Master Hyde, if he were studied,” thought he,\n“must have secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him;\nsecrets compared to which poor Jekyll’s worst would be like\nsunshine. Things cannot continue as they are. It turns me cold to\nthink of this creature stealing like a thief to Harry’s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening! And the\ndanger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the will,\nhe may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulder to the\nwheel if Jekyll will but let me,” he added, “if Jekyll will only let\nme.” For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear as a\ntransparency, the strange clauses of the will.",
