        "THE SAINTS CONVERSE WITH GOD",
        "François de Salignac de La Mothe-Fénelon, Archbishop of Cambray, and\nprivate tutor to the heir-apparent of France, was born of a noble\nfamily in Perigord, 1651. In 1675 he received holy orders, and soon\nafterward made the acquaintance of Bossuet, whom he henceforth looked\nup to as his master. It was the publication of his “De l’Éducation des\nFilles” that brought him his first fame, and had some influence in\nsecuring his appointment in 1689 to be preceptor of the Duke of\nBurgundy. In performing this office he thought it necessary to\ncompose his own text-books, such as would teach the vanity of worldly\ngreatness and the loftiness of virtue. He was promoted to the\narchbishopric of Cambray in 1695, and subsequently became entangled\nin the religious aberrations of Madame Guyon. Fénelon came into\ncontroversy with Bossuet, whose severity against his friend was\nrebuked by the Pope, who, nevertheless, condemned some of the\nArchbishop of Cambray’s views. Fénelon submitted, and withdrew to\nhis diocesan see, where he died in 1715. His deep spirituality and\neloquence are exemplified in the following sermon.",

        "THE SAINTS CONVERSE WITH GOD",
        "Pray without ceasing.–I Thess. v., 17",
        "Of all the duties enjoined by Christianity none is more essential, and\nyet more neglected, than prayer. Most people consider this exercise a\nwearisome ceremony, which they are justified in abridging as much as\npossible. Even those whose profession or fears lead them to pray, do\nit with such languor and wanderings of mind that their prayers, far\nfrom drawing down blessings, only increase their condemnation. I wish\nto demonstrate, in this discourse, first, the general necessity of\nprayer; secondly, its peculiar duty; thirdly, the manner in which we\nought to pray.",
        "First. God alone can instruct us in our duty. The teachings of men,\nhowever wise and well disposed they may be, are still ineffectual, if\nGod do not shed on the soul that light which opens the mind to truth.\nThe imperfections of our fellow creatures cast a shade over the truths\nthat we learn from them. Such is our weakness that we do not receive,\nwith sufficient docility, the instructions of those who are as\nimperfect as ourselves. A thousand suspicions, jealousies, fears, and\nprejudices prevent us from profiting, as we might, by what we hear\nfrom men; and tho they announce the most serious truths, yet what they\ndo weakens the effect of what they say. In a word, it is God alone who\ncan perfectly teach us.",
        "St. Bernard said, in writing to a pious friend–If you are seeking\nless to satisfy a vain curiosity than to get true wisdom, you will\nsooner find it in deserts than in books. The silence of the rocks and\nthe pathless forests will teach you better than the eloquence of the\nmost gifted men. “All,” says St. Augustine, “that we possess of truth\nand wisdom is a borrowed good flowing from that fountain for which\nwe ought to thirst in the fearful desert of this world, that, being\nrefreshed and invigorated by these dews from heaven, we may not faint\nupon the road that conducts us to a better country. Every attempt to\nsatisfy the cravings of our hearts at other sources only increases\nthe void. You will be always poor if you do not possess the only true\nriches.” All light that does not proceed from God is false; it only\ndazzles us; it sheds no illumination upon the difficult paths in which\nwe must walk, along the precipices that are about us.",
        "Our experience and our reflections can not, on all occasions, give us\njust and certain rules of conduct. The advice of our wisest, and most\nsincere friends is not always sufficient; many things escape their\nobservation, and many that do not are too painful to be spoken. They\nsuppress much from delicacy, or sometimes from a fear of transgressing\nthe bounds that our friendship and confidence in them will allow. The\nanimadversions of our enemies, however severe or vigilant they may\nbe, fail to enlighten us with regard to ourselves. Their malignity\nfurnishes our self-love with a pretext for the indulgence of the\ngreatest faults. The blindness of our self-love is so great that we\nfind reasons for being satisfied with ourselves, while all the world\ncondemn us. What must we learn from all this darkness? That it is\nGod alone who can dissipate it; that it is He alone whom we can never\ndoubt; that He alone is true, and knoweth all things; that if we go\nto Him in sincerity, He will teach us what men dare not tell us, what\nbooks can not–all that is essential for us to know.",
        "Be assured that the greatest obstacle to true wisdom is the\nself-confidence inspired by that which is false. The first step toward\nthis precious knowledge is earnestly to desire it, to feel the want of\nit, and to be convinced that they who seek it must address themselves\nto the Father of lights, who freely gives to him who asks in faith.\nBut if it be true that God alone can enlighten us, it is not the less\ntrue that He will do this simply in answer to our prayers. Are we not\nhappy, indeed, in being able to obtain so great a blessing by only\nasking for it? No part of the effort that we make to acquire the\ntransient enjoyments of this life is necessary to obtain these\nheavenly blessings. What will we not do, what are we not willing\nto suffer, to possess dangerous and contemptible things, and often\nwithout any success? It is not thus with heavenly things. God is\nalways ready to grant them to those who make the request in sincerity\nand truth. The Christian life is a long and continual tendency of our\nhearts toward that eternal goodness which we desire on earth. All our\nhappiness consists in thirsting for it. Now this thirst is prayer.\nEver desire to approach your Creator and you will never cease to pray.",
        "Do not think that it is necessary to pronounce many words. To pray is\nto say, Let Thy will be done. It is to form a good purpose; to\nraise your heart to God; to lament your weakness; to sigh at the\nrecollection of your frequent disobedience. This prayer demands\nneither method, nor science, nor reasoning; it is not essential to\nquit one’s employment; it is a simple movement of the heart toward its\nCreator, and a desire that whatever you are doing you may do it to His\nglory. The best of all prayers is to act with a pure intention, and\nwith a continual reference to the will of God. It depends much upon\nourselves whether our prayers be efficacious. It is not by a miracle,\nbut by a movement of the heart that we are benefited; by a submissive\nspirit. Let us believe, let us trust, let us hope, and God never will\nreject our prayer. Yet how many Christians do we see strangers to the\nprivilege, aliens from God, who seldom think of Him, who never open\ntheir hearts to Him; who seek elsewhere the counsels of a false\nwisdom, and vain and dangerous consolations, who can not resolve to\nseek, in humble, fervent prayer to God, a remedy for their griefs and\na true knowledge of their defects, the necessary power to conquer\ntheir vicious and perverse inclinations, and the consolations and\nassistance they require, that they may not be discouraged in a\nvirtuous life.",
        "But some will say, “I have no interest in prayer; it wearies me; my\nimagination is excited by sensible and more agreeable objects, and\nwanders in spite of me.”",
        "If neither your reverence for the great truths of religion, nor the\nmajesty of the ever-present Deity, nor the interest of your eternal\nsalvation, have power to arrest your mind and engage it in prayer, at\nleast mourn with me for your infidelity; be ashamed of your weakness,\nand wish that your thoughts were more under your control; and desire\nto become less frivolous and inconstant. Make an effort to subject\nyour mind to this discipline. You will gradually acquire habit and\nfacility. What is now tedious will become delightful; and you will\nthen feel, with a peace that the world can not give nor take away,\nthat God is good. Make a courageous effort to overcome yourself. There\ncan be no occasion that more demands it.",
        "Secondly. The peculiar obligation of prayer. Were I to give all the\nproofs that the subject affords, I should describe every condition\nof life, that I might point out its dangers, and the necessity of\nrecourse to God in prayer. But I will simply state that under all\ncircumstances we have need of prayer. There is no situation in which\nit is possible to be placed where we have not many virtues to acquire\nand many faults to correct. We find in our temperament, or in our\nhabits, or in the peculiar character of our minds, qualities that do\nnot suit our occupations, and that oppose our duties. One person is\nconnected by marriage to another whose temper is so unequal that life\nbecomes a perpetual warfare. Some, who are exposed to the contagious\natmosphere of the world, find themselves so susceptible to the vanity\nwhich they inhale that all their pure desires vanish. Others have\nsolemnly promised to renounce their resentments, to conquer their\naversions, to suffer with patience certain crosses, and to repress\ntheir eagerness for wealth; but nature prevails, and they are\nvindictive, violent, impatient, and avaricious.",
        "Whence comes it that these resolutions are so frail? That all these\npeople wish to improve, desire to perform their duty toward God and\nman better, and yet fail? It is because our own strength and wisdom,\nalone, are not enough. We undertake to do everything without God;\ntherefore we do not succeed. It is at the foot of the altar that we\nmust seek for counsel which will aid us. It is with God that we must\nlay our plans of virtue and usefulness; it is He alone that can render\nthem successful. Without Him, all our designs, however good they may\nappear, are only temerity and delusion. Let us then pray that we may\nlearn what we are and what we ought to be. By this means we shall not\nonly learn the number and the evil effects of our peculiar faults,\nbut we shall also learn to what virtues we are called, and the way to\npractise them. The rays of that pure and heavenly light that visit\nthe humble soul will beam on us and we shall feel and understand that\neverything is possible to those who put their whole trust in God.\nThus, not only to those who live in retirement, but to those who\nare exposed to the agitations of the world and the excitements of\nbusiness, it is peculiarly necessary, by contemplation and fervent\nprayer, to restore their souls to that serenity which the dissipations\nof life and commerce with men have disturbed. To those who are engaged\nin business, contemplation and prayer are much more difficult than to\nthose who live in retirement; but it is far more necessary for them\nto have frequent recourse to God in fervent prayer. In the most holy\noccupation a certain degree of precaution is necessary.",
        "Do not devote all your time to action, but reserve a certain portion\nof it for meditation upon eternity. We see Jesus Christ inviting His\ndisciples to go apart, in a desert place, and rest awhile, after their\nreturn from the cities, where they had been to announce His religion.\nHow much more necessary is it for us to approach the source of all\nvirtue, that we may revive our declining faith and charity, when we\nreturn from the busy scenes of life, where men speak and act as if\nthey had never known that there is a God! We should look upon prayer\nas the remedy for our weakness, the rectifier of our own faults. He\nwho was without sin prayed constantly; how much more ought we, who are\nsinners, to be faithful in prayer!",
        "Even the exercise of charity is often a snare to us. It calls us to\ncertain occupations that dissipate the mind, and that may degenerate\ninto mere amusement. It is for this reason that St. Chrysostom says\nthat nothing is so important as to keep an exact proportion between\nthe interior source of virtue and the external practise of it; else,\nlike the foolish virgins, we shall find that the oil in our lamp is\nexhausted when the bridegroom comes.",
        "The necessity we feel that God should bless our labors is another\npowerful motive to prayer. It often happens that all human help is\nvain. It is God alone that can aid us, and it does not require much\nfaith to believe that it is less our exertions, our foresight, and our\nindustry than the blessing of the Almighty that can give success to\nour wishes.",
        "Thirdly. Of the manner in which we ought to pray. 1. We must pray with\nattention. God listens to the voice of the heart, not to that of the\nlips. Our whole heart must be engaged in prayer. It must fasten upon\nwhat it prays for; and every human object must disappear from our\nminds. To whom should we speak with attention if not to God? Can He\ndemand less of us than that we should think of what we say to Him?\nDare we hope that He will listen to us, and think of us, when we\nforget ourselves in the midst of our prayers? This attention to\nprayer, which it is so just to exact from Christians, may be practised\nwith less difficulty than we imagine. It is true that the most\nfaithful souls suffer from occasional involuntary distractions. They\ncan not always control their imaginations, and, in the silence of\ntheir spirits, enter into the presence of God. But these unbidden\nwanderings of the mind ought not to trouble us; and they may conduce\nto our perfection even more than the most sublime and affecting\nprayers if we earnestly strive to overcome them, and submit with\nhumility to this experience of our infirmity. But to dwell willingly\non frivolous and worldly things during prayer, to make no effort to\ncheck the vain thoughts that intrude upon this sacred employment and\ncome between us and the Father of our spirits–is not this choosing to\nlive the sport of our senses, and separated from God?",
        "2. We must also ask with faith; a faith so firm that it never\nfalters. He who prays without confidence can not hope that his prayer\nwill be granted. Will not God love the heart that trusts in Him? Will\nHe reject those who bring all their treasures to Him, and repose\neverything upon His goodness? When we pray to God, says St. Cyprian,\nwith entire assurance, it is Himself who has given us the spirit of\nour prayer. Then it is the Father listening to the words of His child;\nit is He who dwells in our hearts, teaching us to pray. But must we\nconfess that this filial confidence is wanting in all our prayers? Is\nnot prayer our resource only when all others have failed us? If we\nlook into hearts, shall we not find that we ask of God as if we had\nnever before received benefits from Him? Shall we not discover there\na secret infidelity that renders us unworthy of His goodness? Let us\ntremble, lest, when Jesus Christ shall judge us, He pronounce the same\nreproach that He did to Peter, “O thou of little faith, wherefore\ndidst thou doubt?”",
        "3. We must join humility with trust. Great God, said Daniel, when we\nprostrate ourselves at Thy feet, we do not place our hopes for the\nsuccess of our prayers upon our righteousness, but upon Thy mercy.\nWithout this disposition in our hearts, all others, however pious they\nmay be, can not please God. St. Augustine observes that the failure of\nPeter should not be attributed to insincerity in his zeal for Jesus\nChrist. He loved his Master in good faith; in good faith he would\nrather have died than have forsaken Him; but his fault lay in trusting\nto his own strength, to do what his own heart dictated.",
        "It is not enough to possess a right spirit, an exact knowledge of\nduty, a sincere desire to perform it We must continually renew this\ndesire, and enkindle this flame within us, at the fountain of pure and\neternal light.",
        "It is the humble and contrite heart that God will not despise. Remark\nthe difference which the evangelist has pointed out between the prayer\nof the proud and presumptuous Pharisee and the humble and penitent\npublican. The one relates his virtues, the other deplores his sins.\nThe good works of the one shall be set aside, while the penitence of\nthe other shall be accepted. It will be thus with many Christians.\nSinners, vile in their own eyes, will be objects of the mercy of God;\nwhile some, who have made professions of piety, will be condemned on\naccount of the pride and arrogance that have contaminated their good\nworks. It will be so because these have said in their hearts, “Lord,\nI thank thee that I am not as other men are.” They imagine themselves\nprivileged; they pretend that they alone have penetrated the mysteries\nof the kingdom of God; they have a language and science of their own;\nthey believe that their zeal can accomplish everything. Their\nregular lives favor their vanity; but in truth they are incapable of\nself-sacrifice, and they go to their devotions with their hearts full\nof pride and presumption. Unhappy are those who pray in this manner!\nUnhappy are those whose prayers do not render them more humble, more\nsubmissive, more watchful over their faults, and more willing to live\nin obscurity!",
        "4. We must pray with love. It is love says St. Augustine, that asks,\nthat seeks, that knocks, that finds, and that is faithful to what it\nfinds. We cease to pray to God as soon as we cease to love Him, as\nsoon as we cease to thirst for His perfections. The coldness of our\nlove is the silence of our hearts toward God. Without this we may\npronounce prayers, but we do not pray; for what shall lead us to\nmeditate upon the laws of God if it be not the love of Him who has\nmade these laws? Let our hearts be full of love, then, and they will\npray. Happy are they who think seriously of the truths of religion;\nbut far more happy are they who feel and love them! We must ardently\ndesire that God will grant us spiritual blessings; and the ardor of\nour wishes must render us fit to receive the blessings. For if we pray\nonly from custom, from fear, in the time of tribulation–- if we honor\nGod only with our lips, while our hearts are far from Him–if we do\nnot feel a strong desire for the success of our prayers–if we feel a\nchilling indifference in approaching Him who is a consuming fire–if\nwe have no zeal for His glory–if we do not feel hatred for sin, and\na thirst for perfection, we can not hope for a blessing upon such\nheartless prayers.",
        "5. We must pray with perseverance. The perfect heart is never weary\nof seeking God. Ought we to complain if God sometimes leaves us to\nobscurity, and doubt, and temptation? Trials purify humble souls, and\nthey serve to expiate the faults of the unfaithful. They confound\nthose who, even in their prayers, have flattered their cowardice and\npride. If an innocent soul, devoted to God, suffer from any secret\ndisturbance, it should be humble, adore the designs of God, and\nredouble its prayers and its fervor. How often do we hear those who\nevery day have to reproach themselves with unfaithfulness toward God\ncomplain that He refuses to answer their prayers! Ought they not to\nacknowledge that it is their sins which have formed a thick cloud\nbetween Heaven and them, and that God has justly hidden Himself from\nthem? How often has He recalled us from our wanderings! How often,\nungrateful as we are, have we been deaf to His voice and insensible to\nHis goodness! He would make us feel that we are blind and miserable\nwhen we forsake Him. He would teach us, by privation, the value of the\nblessings that we have slighted. And shall we not bear our punishment\nwith patience? Who can boast of having done all that he ought to have\ndone; of having repaired all his past errors; of having purified his\nheart, so that he may claim as a right that God should listen to\nhis prayer? Most truly, all our pride, great as it is, would not be\nsufficient to inspire such presumption! If then, the Almightly do not\ngrant our petitions, let us adore His justice, let us be silent, let\nus humble ourselves, and let us pray without ceasing. This humble\nperseverance will obtain from Him what we should never obtain by our\nown merit. It will make us pass happily from darkness to light; for\nknow, says St. Augustine that God is near to us even when He appears\nfar from us.",
        "6. We should pray with a pure intention. We should not mingle in our\nprayers what is false with what is real; what is perishable with what\nis eternal; low and temporal interests with that which concerns our\nsalvation. Do not seek to render God the protector of your self-love\nand ambition, but the promoter of your good desires. You ask for the\ngratification of your passions, or to be delivered from the cross,\nof which He knows you have need. Carry not to the foot of the altar\nirregular desires and indiscreet prayers. Sigh not for vain and\nfleeting pleasures. Open your heart to your Father in heaven, that His\nSpirit may enable you to ask for the true riches. How can He grant\nyou, says St. Augustine, what you do not yourself desire to receive?\nYou pray every day that His will may be done, and that His kingdom may\ncome. How can you utter this prayer with sincerity when you prefer\nyour own will to His, and make His law yield to the vain pretexts with\nwhich your self-love seeks to elude it? Can you make this prayer–you\nwho disturb His reign in your heart by so many impure and vain\ndesires? You, in fine, who fear the coming of His reign, and do not\ndesire that God should grant what you seem to pray for? No! If He, at\nthis moment, were to offer to give you a new heart, and render you\nhumble, and willing to bear the cross, your pride would revolt, and\nyou would not accept the offer; or you would make a reservation in\nfavor of your ruling passion, and try to accommodate your piety to\nyour humor and fancies!",
