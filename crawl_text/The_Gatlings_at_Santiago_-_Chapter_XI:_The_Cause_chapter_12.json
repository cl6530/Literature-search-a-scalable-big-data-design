        "The causes of these conditions are not far to seek. The United States\nhas not had an army since 1866. There has been no such a thing as a\nbrigade, a division, or a corps. There has been no opportunity to\nstudy and practice on a large scale, in a practical way, the problems\nof organization and supply. The Army has been administered as a unit,\nand the usual routine of business gradually became such that not a\nwheel could be turned nor a nail driven in any of the supply\ndepartments without express permission, previously obtained from the\nbureau chief in Washington. The same remarks apply equally to all the\nother staff departments. The administration had become a bureaucracy\nbecause the whole Army for thirty years had been administered as one\nbody, without the subdivisions into organizations which are inevitable\nin war-time and in larger bodies.",
        "War became a reality with great suddenness. Those who have grown gray\nin the service, and whose capacity, honesty, and industry had never\nbeen and can not be impeached, found themselves confronted with the\nproblem of handling nearly three hundred thousand men, without\nauthority to change the system of supply and transportation. The\nminutest acts of officers of these departments are regulated by laws\nof Congress, enacted with a view of the small regular force in time of\npeace, and with no provisions for modifications in war. In authorizing\nthe formation of large volunteer armies, Congress did not authorize\nany change in the system of administration or make any emergency\nprovision. As before, every detail of supply and transportation had to\nbe authorized from the central head.",
        "The administrative bureaus were handicapped to some extent by\nincompetent and ignorant members. Late in the campaign it was learned\nthat the way to a “soft snap” was through the Capitol, and some came\nin that way who would certainly never have entered the Army in any\nother.",
        "There were alleged staff officers who had tried to enter the service\nthrough the regular channels and who had failed, either by lack of\nability or bad conduct, to keep up with the pace set by classmates at\nthe Academy; there were others who were known as failures in civil\nlife and as the “black sheep” of eminent families; and there were some\nwho must have been utterly unknown before the war, as they will be\nafterward.",
        "How these persons ever obtained places high above deserving officers\nof capacity and experience is a question which cries aloud for\nexposure–but in a good many cases they did. Indeed, it is to be\nobserved that, for that matter, the next register of the Army will\nshow a great many more promotions into the Volunteer service, of\nofficers who never heard a hostile bullet during the war, who never\nleft the United States at all, than it will of deserving officers who\nbore the heat and burden of the march and the battle.",
        "The most discouraging thing about it all to a line officer is that\nthis same register will afford no means of determining who did the\nservice and who did the “baby act.” Lieut. Blank will be borne thereon\nas major and subsequently colonel of the Steenth Volunteers (which\nnever left the State rendezvous, probably) during the war with Spain;\nLieut. Blank No. 2 will be carried on the same book as second\nlieutenant, –– Infantry, during the same war. The gentle reader will\nat once “spot” the man who was so highly promoted as a gallant fellow\nwho distinguished himself upon the bloody field; the other will be set\ndown as the man who did nothing and deserved nothing.",
        "Yet–the ones who went received no promotion, and those who staid\nbehind and by their careless incompetence permitted camps amid the\npeaceful scenes of homes and plenty to become the hot-beds of fever\nand disease–these are the ones borne as field and other officers of\nthe Volunteers.",
        "To illustrate some of the material with big titles sent to “assist” in\nrunning the staff departments, two incidents will suffice.",
        "On the 11th of June, at a certain headquarters, it was desired to send\na message, demanding reply, to each transport. A gray-haired officer\nturned to another and said, “Whom shall we send with this? Will\nSo-and-so do?” naming one of the before-mentioned civil appointments.\n“For heaven’s sake, no! He would tie up the whole business. Send an\norderly,” was the reply. The orderly, an enlisted man of the Regulars,\nwas sent. The officer thus adjudged less competent to carry a message\nthan a private soldier was perhaps actuated by a high sense of duty;\nbut he filled a place which should have been occupied by an\nexperienced and able officer–no, he did not fill it, but he prevented\nsuch a man from doing so.",
        "The second incident was related by an officer on a transport bound for\nhome. Say his name was–oh well, Smith.",
        "Smith went, on the 20th of July, to a certain headquarters in the\nfield on business. Those who could have attended to it were absent,\nbut there was one of the recent arrivals, a high-ranking aide, there,\nand he, sorry for Smith’s worn-out look of hunger, heat, and thirst,\nasked if he would have a drink. Smith, expecting at the best a canteen\nof San Juan River water, said he was a little dry.",
        "The newly-arrived clapped his hands, and, at the summons, a colored\nwaiter in spotless white duck appeared. “Waitah, take this gentleman’s\nordah,” said the host. Smith, greatly astonished, asked what could be\nhad, and was yet more astonished to learn that he could be served with\nCanadian or domestic whisky, claret, champagne, or sherry. Much\nbewildered, and utterly forgetting the awful dangers of liquor in the\ntropics, he called for Canadian Club. When it came, on a\nnapkin-covered tray, he looked for water, and was about to use some\nfrom a bucket full of ice which he at that moment espied. “Aw! hold\non,” exclaimed the host; “we nevah use that, don’t y’ know, except to\ncool the apollinaris. Waitah, bring the gentleman a bottle of\napollinaris to wash down his liquor.”",
        "Within half a mile were soldiers and officers lying sick in hospital\non the ground, eating hardtack and bacon, and drinking San Juan\nstraight, because hospital supplies and rations could not be got to\nthe front!",
        "It was this same officer who explained that he approached his\nheadquarters “by rushes,” upon his arrival, for fear the enemy would\nsee him and consider this reinforcement a violation of the truce.",
        "These are two examples of some of the able assistants from civil life\nwho were sent to help feed, clothe, and transport the 5th Corps.",
        "With such assistants, is it any wonder that, under such extraordinary\ncircumstances as those encountered in Cuba, a system designed for\npeace and 25,000 men weakened in some respects when the attempt was\nmade to apply it to 300,000 in time of war?",
        "The great wonder is that it did the work as well as it did. And this\nwas due to the superhuman exertions of the chief officers of the\nsupply departments and their experienced assistants. These men knew no\nrest. They were untiring and zealous. On their own responsibility they\ncut the red tape to the very smallest limit. Instead of the regular\nreturns and requisitions, the merest form of lead-pencil memorandum\nwas sufficient to obtain the necessary supplies, whenever they were\navailable. This much was absolutely necessary, for these officers were\npersonally responsible for every dollar’s worth of supplies and had to\nprotect themselves in some degree. As it is now, many of them will\nfind it years before their accounts are finally settled, unless some\nprovision be made by law for their relief. This disregard of routine\nwas essential; but how much to be desired is a system suited to the\nexigencies of the service, both in peace and war!",
        "There is a lesson to be learned from these experiences, and it is\nthis: The commanding officer of any army organization should not be\nhampered in the matter of supplies by having to obtain the approval or\ndisapproval of a junior in rank, in a distant bureau, who knows\nnothing about the circumstances. In other words, the system which\ncauses the staff departments of the United States Army to regard a\ncivilian as their head, and makes them virtually independent of their\nline commanders, is an utterly vicious system. If an officer is\ncompetent to command an organization, he should be considered\ncompetent to look after the details of its administration, and should\nbe held responsible, not only for its serviceable condition at all\ntimes, but for the care of its property and for all the other details\nconnected with its service.",
        "The quartermaster, or commissary, or other officer of a supply\ndepartment should not know any authority on earth higher or other than\nthe officer in command of the force he is to serve, except those in\nthe line above such chief, and then only when such orders come through\nhis chief.",
        "The commanding officer having ordered supplies to be procured, there\nshould be no question whatever in regard to their being furnished.\nThey should come at once and without fail. If they were not necessary,\nhold him responsible.",
        "This theory of administration eliminates the bureaucracy which has\ninsidiously crept upon the Army, and relegates to their proper\nposition the supply departments.",
        "The General Staff proper has a higher field of usefulness than the\nmere problems of supply. Its business is to care for the organization,\nmobilization, and strategic disposition of all the forces, both naval\nand military, of the United States. Its head should be the President,\nand the two divisions should be under the general commanding the Army\nand the admiral commanding the Navy. The remainder of this staff\nshould be composed of a small but select personnel, and should limit\nits duties exclusively to those set forth above.",
