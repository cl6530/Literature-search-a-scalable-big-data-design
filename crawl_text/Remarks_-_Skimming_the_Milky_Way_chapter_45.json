        "THE COMET.",
        "The comet is a kind of astronomical parody on the planet. Comets look some\nlike planets, but they are thinner and do not hurt so hard when they hit\nanybody as a planet does. The comet was so called because it had hair on\nit, I believe, but late years the bald-headed comet is giving just as good\nsatisfaction everywhere.",
        "The characteristic features of a comet are: A nucleus, a nebulous light or\ncoma, and usually a luminous train or tail worn high. Sometimes several\ntails are observed on one comet, but this occurs only in flush times.",
        "When I was young I used to think I would like to be a comet in the sky, up\nabove the world so high, with nothing to do but loaf around and play with\nthe little new-laid planets and have a good time, but now I can see where\nI was wrong. Comets also have their troubles, their perihilions, their\nhyperbolas and their parabolas. A little over 300 years ago Tycho Brahe\ndiscovered that comets were extraneous to our atmosphere, and since then\ntimes have improved. I can see that trade is steadier and potatoes run\nless to tows than they did before.",
        "Soon after that they discovered that comets all had more or less\nperiodicity. Nobody knows how they got it. All the astronomers had been\nwatching them day and night and didn’t know when they were exposed, but\nthere was no time to talk and argue over the question. There were two or\nthree hundred comets all down with it at once. It was an exciting time.",
        "Comets sometimes live to a great age. This shows that the night air is not\nso injurious to the health as many people would have us believe. The great\ncomet of 1780 is supposed to have been the one that was noticed about the\ntime of Caesar’s death, 44 B.C., and still, when it appeared in Newton’s\ntime, seventeen hundred years after its first grand farewell tour, Ike\nsaid that it was very well preserved, indeed, and seemed to have retained\nall its faculties in good shape.",
        "Astronomers say that the tails of all comets are turned from the sun. I do\nnot know why they do this, whether it is etiquette among them or just a\nmere habit.",
        "A later writer on astronomy said that the substance of the nebulosity and\nthe tail is of almost inconceivable tenuity. He said this and then death\ncame to his relief. Another writer says of the comet and its tail that\n“the curvature of the latter and the acceleration of the periodic time in\nthe case of Encke’s comet indicate their being affected by a resisting\nmedium which has never been observed to have the slightest influence on\nthe planetary periods.”",
        "I do not fully agree with the eminent authority, though he may be right.\nMuch fear has been the result of the comet’s appearance ever since the\nworld began, and it is as good a thing to worry about as anything I know\nof. If we could get close to a comet without frightening it away, we would\nfind that we could walk through it anywhere as we could through the glare\nof a torchlight procession. We should so live that we will not be ashamed\nto look a comet in the eye, however. Let us pay up our newspaper\nsubscription and lead such lives that when the comet strikes we will be\nready.",
        "Some worry a good deal about the chances for a big comet to plow into the\nsun some dark, rainy night, and thus bust up the whole universe. I wish\nthat was all I had to worry about. If any respectable man will agree to\npay my taxes and funeral expenses, I will agree to do his worrying about\nthe comet’s crashing into the bosom of the sun and knocking its daylights\nout.",
        "THE SUN.",
        "This luminous body is 92,000,000 miles from the earth, though there have\nbeen mornings this winter when it seemed to me that it was further than\nthat. A railway train going at the rate of 40 miles per hour would be 263\nyears going there, to say nothing of stopping for fuel or water, or\nstopping on side tracks to wait for freight trains to pass. Several years\nago it was discovered that a slight error had been made in the\ncalculations of the sun’s distance from the earth, and, owing to a\nmisplaced logarithm, or something of that kind, a mistake of 3,000,000\nmiles was made in the result. People cannot be too careful in such\nmatters. Supposing that, on the strength of the information contained in\nthe old time-table, a man should start out with only provisions sufficient\nto take him 89,000,000 miles and should then find that 3,0000,000 miles\nstill stretched out ahead of him. He would then have to buy fresh figs of\nthe train boy in order to sustain life. Think of buying nice fresh figs on\na train that had been en route 250 years!",
        "Imagine a train boy starting out at ten years of age, and perishing at the\nage of 60 years with only one-fifth of his journey accomplished. Think of\nfive train boys, one after the other, dying of old age on the way, and the\ntrain at last pulling slowly into the depot with not a living thing on\nboard except the worms in the “nice eating apples!”",
        "The sun cannot be examined through an ordinary telescope with impunity.\nOnly one man every tried that, and he is now wearing a glass eye that cost\nhim $9.",
        "If you examine the sun through an ordinary solar microscope, you discover\nthat it has a curdled or mottled appearance, as though suffering from\nbiliousness. It is also marked here and there by long streaks of light,\ncalled faculae, which look like foam flecks below a cataract. The spots on\nthe sun vary from minute pores the size of an ordinary school district to\nspots 100,000 miles in diameter, visible to the nude eye. The center of\nthese spots is as black as a brunette cat, and is called the umbra, so\ncalled because it resembles an umbrella. The next circle is less dark, and\ncalled the penumbra, because it so closely resembles the penumbra.",
        "There are many theories regarding these spots, but, to be perfectly candid\nwith the gentle reader, neither Prof. Proctor nor myself can tell exactly\nwhat they are. If we could get a little closer, we flatter ourselves that\nwe could speak more definitely. My own theory is they are either, first,\nopen air caucuses held by the colored people of the sun; or, second, they\nmay be the dark horses in the campaign; or, third, they may be the spots\nknocked off the defeated candidate by the opposition.",
        "Frankly, however, I do not believe either of these theories to be tenable.\nProf. Proctor sneers at these theories also on the ground that these spots\ndo not appear to revolve so fast as the sun. This, however, I am prepared\nto explain upon the theory that this might be the result of delays in the\nreturns However, I am free to confess that speculative science is filled\nwith the intangible.",
        "The sun revolves upon his or her axletree, as the case may be, once in 25\nto 28 of our days, so that a man living there would have almost two years\nto pay a 30-day note. We should so live that when we come to die we may go\nat once to the sun.",
        "Regarding the sun’s temperature, Sir John Herschel says that it is\nsufficient to melt a shell of ice covering its entire surface to a depth\nof 40 feet. I do not know whether he made this experiment personally or\nhired a man to do it for him.",
        "The sun is like the star spangled banner–as it is “still there.” You get\nup to-morrow morning just before sunrise and look away toward the east,\nand keep on looking in that direction, and at last you will see a fine\nsight, if what I have been told is true. If the sunrise is as grand as the\nsunset, it indeed must be one of nature’s most sublime phenomena.",
        "The sun is the great source of light and heat for our earth. If the sun\nwere to go somewhere for a few weeks for relaxation and rest, it would be\na cold day for us. The moon, too, would be useless, for she is largely\ndependent on the sun. Animal life would soon cease and real estate would\nbecome depressed in price. We owe very much of our enjoyment to the sun,\nand not many years ago there were a large number of people who worshiped\nthe sun. When a man showed signs of emotional insanity, they took him up\non the observatory of the temple and sacrificed him to the sun. They were\na very prosperous and happy people. If the conqueror had not come among\nthem with civilization and guns and grand juries they would have been very\nhappy, indeed.",
        "THE STARS.",
        "There is much in the great field of astronomy that is discouraging to the\nsavant who hasn’t the time nor means to rummage around through the\nheavens. At times I am almost hopeless, and feel like saying to the great\nyearnful, hungry world: “Grope on forever. Do not ask me for another\nscientific fact. Find it out yourself. Hunt up your own new-laid planets,\nand let me have a rest. Never ask me again to sit up all night and take\ncare of a newborn world, while you lie in bed and reck not.”",
        "I get no salary for examining the trackless void night after night when I\nought to be in bed. I sacrifice my health in order that the public may\nknow at once of the presence of a red-hot comet, fresh from the factory.\nAnd yet, what thanks do I get?",
        "Is it surprising that every little while I contemplate withdrawing from\nscientific research, to go and skin an eight-mule team down through the\ndim vista of relentless years?",
        "Then, again, you take a certain style of star, which you learn from\nProfessor Simon Newcomb is such a distance that it takes 50,000 years for\nits light to reach Boston. Now, we will suppose that after looking over\nthe large stock of new and second-hand stars, and after examining the\nspring catalogue and price list, I decide that one of the smaller size\nwill do me, and I buy it. How do I know that it was there when I bought\nit? Its cold and silent rays may have ceased 49,000 years before I was\nborn and the intelligence be still on the way. There is too much margin\nbetween sale and delivery. Every now and then another astronomer comes to\nme and says: “Professor, I have discovered another new star and intend to\nfile it. Found it last night about a mile and a half south of the zenith,\nrunning loose. Haven’t heard of anybody who has lost a star of the\nfifteenth magnitude, about thirteen hands high, with light mane and tail,\nhave you?” Now, how do I know that he has discovered a brand new star?\nHow can I discover whether he is or is not playing an old, threadbare star\non me for a new one?",
        "We are told that there has been no perceptible growth or decay in the star\nbusiness since man began to roam around through space, in his mind, and\nmake figures on the barn door with red chalk showing the celestial time\ntable.",
        "No serious accidents have occurred in the starry heavens since I began to\nobserve and study their habits. Not a star has waxed, not a star has\nwaned to my knowledge. Not a planet has season-cracked or shown any of\nthe injurious effects of our rigorous climate. Not a star has ripened\nprematurely or fallen off the trees. The varnish on the very oldest stars\nI find on close and critical examination to be in splendid condition.\nThey will all no doubt wear as long as we need them, and wink on long\nafter we have ceased to wink back.",
        "In 1866 there appeared suddenly in the northern crown a star of about the\nthird magnitude and worth at least $250. It was generally conceded by\nastronomers that this was a brand new star that had never been used, but\nupon consulting Argelander’s star catalogue and price list it was found\nthat this was not a new star at all, but an old, faded star of the ninth\nmagnitude, with the front breadths turned wrong side out and trimmed with\nmoonlight along the seams. After a few days of phenomenal brightness, it\ngently ceased to draw a salary as a star of the third magnitude, and\nwalked home with an Uncle Tom’s Cabin company.",
        "It is such things as this that make the life of the astronomer one of\nconstant and discouraging toil. I have long contemplated, as I say, the\nadvisability of retiring from this field of science and allowing others to\nlight the northern lights, skim the milky way and do other celestial\nchores. I would do it myself cheerfully if my health would permit, but for\nyears I have realized, and so has my wife, that my duties as an astronomer\nkept me up too much at night, and my wife is certainly right about it when\nshe says if I insist on scanning the heavens night after night, coming\nhome late with the cork out of my telescope and my eyes red and swollen\nwith these exhausting night vigils, I will be cut down in my prime. So I\nam liable to abandon the great labor to which I had intended to devote my\nlife, my dazzling genius and my princely income. I hope that other savants\nwill spare me the pain of another refusal, for my mind is fully made up\nthat unless another skimmist is at once secured, the milky way will\nhenceforth remain unskum.",
