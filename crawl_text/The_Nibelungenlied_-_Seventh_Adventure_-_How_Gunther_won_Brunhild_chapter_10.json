        "The while they thus did parley / their ship did forward glide\nSo near unto the castle / that soon the king espied\nAloft within the casements / many a maiden fair to see.\nThat all to him were strangers / thought King Gunther mournfully.",
        "390",
        "He asked then of Siegfried, / who bare him company:\n“Know’st thou aught of the maidens, / who the same may be,\nGazing yonder downward / upon us on the tide?\nHowe’er is named their master, / minded are they high in pride.”",
        "391",
        "Then spake the valiant Siegfried: / “Now thither shalt thou spy\nUnseen among the ladies, / then not to me deny\nWhich, wert thou free in choosing, / thou’dst take to be thy queen.\"\n“That will I do,” then answered / Gunther the valiant knight and keen.",
        "392",
        "“I see there one among them / by yonder casement stand,\nClad in snow-white raiment: / ’tis she my eyes demand,\nSo buxom she in stature, / so fair she is to see.\nAn I were free in choosing, / she it is my wife must be.”",
        "393",
        "“Full well now in choosing / thine eyes have guided thee:\nIt is the stately Brunhild / the maiden fair to see,\nThat doth now unto her / thy heart and soul compel.\"\nAll the maiden’s bearing / pleased the royal Gunther well.",
        "394",
        "But soon the queen commanded / from casement all to go\nOf those her beauteous maidens: / they should not stand there so\nTo be gazed at by the strangers. / They must obey her word.\nWhat were the ladies doing, / of that moreover have we heard.",
        "395",
        "Unto the noble strangers / their beauty they would show,\nA thing which lovely women / are ever wont to do.\nUnto the narrow casements / came they crowding on,\nWhen they spied the strangers: / that they might also see, ’twas done.",
        "396",
        "But four the strangers numbered, / who came unto that land.\nSiegfried the doughty / the king’s steed led in hand:\nThey saw it from the casements, / many a lovely maid,\nAnd saw the willing service / unto royal Gunther paid.",
        "397",
        "Then held he by the bridle / for him his gallant steed,\nA good and fair-formed charger, / strong and of noble breed,\nUntil the royal Gunther / into the saddle sprung.\nThus did serve him Siegfried: / a service all forgot ere long.",
        "398",
        "Then his own steed he also / led forth upon the shore.\nSuch menial service had he / full seldom done before,\nThat he should hold the stirrup / for monarch whomsoe’er.\nDown gazing from the casements / beheld it ladies high and fair.",
        "399",
        "At every point according, / the heroes well bedight\n–Their dress and eke their chargers / of color snowy white–\nWere like unto each other, / and well-wrought shield each one\nOf the good knights bore with him, / that brightly glimmered in the sun.",
        "400",
        "Jewelled well was saddle / and narrow martingale\nAs they rode so stately / in front of Brunhild’s Hall,\nAnd thereon bells were hanging / of red gold shining bright.\nSo came they to that country, / as fitting was for men of might,",
        "401",
        "With spears all newly polished, / with swords, well-made that were\nAnd by the stately heroes / hung down unto the spur:\nSuch bore the valiant riders / of broad and cutting blade.\nThe noble show did witness / Brunhild the full stately maid.",
        "402",
        "With him came then Dankwart / and Hagen, doughty thane.\nThe story further telleth / how that the heroes twain\nOf color black as raven / rich attire wore,\nAnd each a broad and mighty / shield of rich adornment bore.",
        "403",
        "Rich stones from India’s country / every eye could see,\nImpending on their tunics, / sparkle full brilliantly.\nTheir vessel by the river / they left without a guard,\nAs thus the valiant heroes / rode undaunted castleward.",
        "404",
        "Six and fourscore towers / without they saw rise tall,\nThree spacious palaces / and moulded well a hall\nAll wrought of precious marble / green as blade of grass,\nWherein the royal Brunhild / with company of fair ladies was.",
        "405",
        "The castle doors unbolted / were flung open wide\nAs out toward them / the men of Brunhild hied\nAnd received the strangers / into their Lady’s land.\nTheir steeds they bade take over, / and also shield from out the hand.",
        "406",
        "Then spake a man-in-waiting: / “Give o’er the sword each thane,\nAnd eke the shining armor.\"– / “Good friend, thou ask’st in vain,\"\nSpake of Tronje Hagen; / “the same we’d rather wear.\"\nThen gan straightway Siegfried / the country’s custom to declare.",
        "407",
        "“’Tis wont within this castle, / –of that be now aware–\nThat never any stranger / weapons here shall bear.\nNow let them hence be carried: / well dost thou as I say.\"\nIn this did full unwilling / Hagen, Gunther’s man, obey.",
        "408",
        "They bade the strangers welcome / with drink and fitting rest.\nSoon might you see on all sides / full many knights the best\nIn princely weeds apparelled / to their reception go:\nYet did they mickle gazing / who would the keen new-comers know.",
        "409",
        "Then unto Lady Brunhild / the tidings strange were brought\nHow that unknown warriors / now her land had sought,\nIn stately apparel / come sailing o’er the sea.\nThe maiden fair and stately / gave question how the same might be.",
        "410",
        "“Now shall ye straight inform me,\" / spake she presently,\n“Who so unfamiliar / these warrior knights may be,\nThat within my castle / thus so lordly stand,\nAnd for whose sake the heroes / have hither journeyed to my land.”",
        "411",
        "Then spake to her a servant: / “Lady, I well can say\nOf them I’ve ne’er seen any / before this present day:\nBe it not that one among them / is like unto Siegfried.\nHim give a goodly welcome: / so is to thee my loyal rede.",
        "412",
        "“The next of the companions / he is a worthy knight:\nIf that were in his power / he well were king of might\nO’er wide domains of princes, / the which might reach his hand.\nNow see him by the others / so right majestically stand.",
        "413",
        "“The third of the companions, / that he’s a man of spleen,\n–Withal of fair-formed body, / know thou, stately Queen,–\nDo tell his rapid glances / that dart so free from him.\nHe is in all his thinking / a man, I ween, of mood full grim.",
        "414",
        "“The youngest one among them / he is a worthy knight:\nAs modest as a maiden, / I see the thane of might\nGoodly in his bearing / standing so fair to see,\nWe all might fear if any / affront to him should offered be.",
        "415",
        "“How blithe soe’er his manner, / how fair soe’er is he,\nWell could he cause of sorrow / to stately woman be,\nIf he gan show his anger. / In him may well be seen\nHe is in knightly virtues / a thane of valor bold and keen.”",
        "416",
        "Then spake the queen in answer: / “Bring now my robes to hand.\nAnd is the mighty Siegfried / come unto this land,\nFor love of me brought thither, / he pays it with his life.\nI fear him not so sorely / that I e’er become his wife.”",
        "417",
        "So was fair Brunhild / straightway well arrayed.\nThen went with her thither / full many a beauteous maid,\nA hundred good or over, / bedight right merrily.\nThe full beauteous maidens / would those stranger warriors see.",
        "418",
        "And with them went the warriors / there of Isenland,\nThe knights attending Brunhild, / who bore sword in hand,\nFive hundred men or over. / Scarce heart the strangers kept\nAs those knights brave and seemly / down from out the saddle leapt.",
        "419",
        "When the royal lady / Siegfried espied,\nNow mote ye willing listen / what there the maiden said.\n“Welcome be thou, Siegfried, / hither unto this land.\nWhat meaneth this thy journey, / gladly might I understand.”",
        "420",
        "“Full mickle do I thank thee, / my Lady, high Brunhild,\nThat thou art pleased to greet me, / noble Princess mild,\nBefore this knight so noble, / who stands before me here:\nFor he is my master, / whom first to honor fitting were.",
        "421",
        "“Born is he of Rhineland: / what need I say more?\nFor thee ’tis highest favor / that we do hither fare.\nThee will he gladly marry, / an bring that whatsoe’er.\nBetimes shalt thou bethink thee: / my master will thee never spare.",
        "422",
        "“For his name is Gunther / and he a mighty king.\nIf he thy love hath won him, / more wants he not a thing.\nIn sooth the king so noble / hath bade me hither fare:\nAnd gladly had I left it, / might I to thwart his wishes dare.”",
        "423",
        "She spake: “Is he thy master / and thou his vassal art,\nSome games to him I offer, / and dare he there take part,\nAnd comes he forth the victor, / so am I then his wife:\nAnd be it I that conquer, / then shall ye forfeit each his life.”",
        "424",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Lady, let us see\nThy games so fraught with peril. / Before should yield to thee\nGunther my master, / that well were something rare.\nHe trows he yet is able / to win a maid so passing fair.”",
        "425",
        "“Then shall ye try stone-putting / and follow up the cast,\nAnd the spear hurl with me. / Do ye naught here in haste.\nFor well may ye pay forfeit / with honor eke and life:\nBethink ye thus full calmly,\" / spake she whom Gunther would for wife.",
        "426",
        "Siegfried the valiant / stepped unto the king,\nAnd bade him speak out freely / his thoughts upon this thing\nUnto the queen so wayward, / he might have fearless heart.\n“For to well protect thee / from her do I know an art.”",
        "427",
        "Then spake the royal Gunther: / “Now offer, stately Queen,\nWhat play soe’er thou mayest. / And harder had it been,\nYet would I all have ventured / for all thy beauty’s sake.\nMy head I’ll willing forfeit / or thyself my wife I’ll make.”",
        "428",
        "When therefore the Queen Brunhild / heard how the matter stood\nThe play she begged to hasten, / as indeed she should.\nShe bade her servants fetch her / therefor apparel trim,\nA mail-coat ruddy golden / and shield well wrought from boss to rim.",
        "429",
        "A battle-tunic silken / the maid upon her drew,\nThat in ne’er a contest / weapon pierced through,\nOf skins from land of Libya, / and structure rare and fine;\nAnd brilliant bands embroidered / might you see upon it shine.",
        "430",
        "Meanwhile were the strangers / jibed with many a threat;\nDankwart and Hagen, / their hearts began to beat.\nHow here the king should prosper / were they of doubtful mood,\nThinking, “This our journey / shall bring us wanderers naught of good.”",
        "431",
        "The while did also Siegfried / the thane beyond compare,\nBefore ’twas marked by any, / unto the ship repair,\nWhere he found his sightless mantle[2] / that did hidden lie,\nAnd slipped into ’t full deftly: / so was he veiled from every eye.",
        "[2] See strophe 97, note.",
        "432",
        "Thither back he hied him / and found great company\nAbout the queen who ordered / what the high play should be.\nThere went he all in secret; / so cunningly ’twas done,\nOf all around were standing / perceived him never any one.",
        "433",
        "The ring it was appointed / wherein the play should be\n’Fore many a keen warrior / who the same should see.\nMore than seven hundred / were seen their weapons bear,\nThat whoso were the victor / they might sure the same declare.",
        "434",
        "Thither was come Brunhild; / all armed she did stand\nLike as she were to combat / for many a royal land;\nUpon her silken tunic / were gold bars many a one,\nAnd glowing ’mid the armor / her flesh of winsome color shone.",
        "435",
        "Then followed her attendants / and with them thither brought\nAt once a shield full stately, / of pure red gold ’twas wrought,\nWith steel-hard bands for facings, / full mickle ’twas and broad,\nWherewith in the contest / would guard herself the lovely maid.",
        "436",
        "To hold the shield securely / a well-wrought band there was,\nWhereon lay precious jewels / green as blade of grass.\nFull many a ray their lustre / shot round against the gold.\nHe were a man full valiant / whom this high dame should worthy hold.",
        "437",
        "The shield was ’neath the boss-point, / as to us is said,\nGood three spans in thickness, / which should bear the maid.\nOf steel ’twas wrought so richly / and had of gold such share,\nThat chamberlain and fellows / three the same scarce could bear.",
        "438",
        "When the doughty Hagen / the shield saw thither brought,\nSpake the knight of Tronje, / and savage was his thought:\n“Where art thou now, King Gunther? / Shall we thus lose our life!\nWhom here thou seekst for lover, / she is the very Devil’s wife.”",
        "439",
        "List more of her apparel; / she had a goodly store.\nOf silk of Azagang / a tunic made she wore,\nAll bedight full richly; / amid its color shone\nForth from the queen it covered, / full many a sparkling precious stone.",
        "440",
        "Then brought they for the lady, / large and heavy there,\nAs she was wont to hurl it, / a sharply-pointed spear;\nStrong and massive was it, / huge and broad as well,\nAnd at both its edges / it cut with devastation fell.",
        "441",
        "To know the spear was heavy / list ye wonders more:\nThree spears of common measure / ’twould make, and something o’er.\nOf Brunhild’s attendants / three scarce the same could bear.\nThe heart of noble Gunther / thereat began to fill with fear.",
        "442",
        "Within his soul he thought him: / “What pickle am I in?\nOf hell the very Devil, / how might he save his skin?\nMight I at home in Burgundy / safe and living be,\nShould she for many a season / from proffered love of mine be free.”",
        "443",
        "Then spake Hagen’s brother / the valiant Dankwart:\n“In truth this royal journey / doth sorely grieve my heart.\nWe passed for good knights one time: / what caitiff’s death, if we\nHere in far-off country / a woman’s game are doomed to be!",
        "444",
        "“It rueth me full sorely / that I came to this land.\nAnd had my brother Hagen / his good sword in hand,\nAnd had I mine to help him, / a bit more gently then,\nA little tame of spirit, / might show themselves all Brunhild’s men.",
        "445",
        "“And know it of a certain / to lord it thus they’d cease;\nE’en though oaths a thousand / I’d sworn to keep the peace,\nBefore that I’d see perish / my dear lord shamefully,\nAmid the souls departed / this fair maid herself should be.”",
        "446",
        "“Well should we unhampered / quit at last this land,\"\nSpake his brother Hagen, / “did we in armor stand,\nSuch as we need for battle, / and bore we broadswords good:\n’Twould be a little softened, / this doughty lady’s haughty mood.”",
        "447",
        "Well heard the noble maiden / what the warriors spoke.\nBack athwart her shoulder / she sent a smiling look:\n“Now thinks he him so valiant, / so let them armed stand;\nTheir full keen-edged broadswords / give the warriors each in hand.”",
        "448",
        "When they their swords received, / as the maiden said,\nThe full valiant Dankwart / with joy his face grew red.\n“Now play they what them pleaseth,\" / cried the warrior brave;\n“Gunther is yet a freeman, / since now in hand good swords we have.”",
        "449",
        "The royal Brunhild’s prowess / with terror was it shown.\nInto the ring they bore her / in sooth a ponderous stone,\nGreat and all unwieldy, / huge it was and round:\nAnd scarce good knights a dozen / together raised it from the ground.",
        "450",
        "To put this was her custom / after trial with the spear.\nThereat the men of Burgundy / began to quake with fear.\n“Alack! Alack!” quoth Hagen, / “what seeks the king for bride?\nBeneath in hell ’twere better / the Devil had her by his side!”",
        "451",
        "On her white arms the flowing / sleeves she backward flung,\nThen with grasp of power / the shield in hand she swung,\nAnd spear poised high above her. / So did the contest start.\nGunther and Siegfried / saw Brunhild’s ire with falling heart.",
        "452",
        "And were it not that Siegfried / a ready help did bring,\nSurely then had perished / beneath her hand the king.\nThere went he unperceived / and the king’s hand did touch.\nGunther at his cunning / artifice was troubled much.",
        "453",
        "“What is that hath touched me?\" / thought the monarch keen.\nThen gazed he all around him: / none was there to be seen.\nA voice spake: “Siegfried is it, / a friend that holds thee dear.\nBefore this royal maiden / shall thy heart be free from fear.",
        "454",
        "“Thy shield in hand now give me / and leave it me to bear,\nAnd do thou rightly mark thee / what thou now shalt hear.\nNow make thyself the motions, / –the power leave to me.\"\nWhen he did know him rightly, / the monarch’s heart was filled with glee.",
        "455",
        "“Now secret keep my cunning, / let none e’er know the same:\nThen shall the royal maiden / here find but little game\nOf glory to win from thee, / as most to her is dear.\nBehold now how the lady / stands before thee void of fear.”",
        "456",
        "The spear the stately maiden / with might and main did wield,\nAnd huge and broad she hurled it / upon the new-made shield,\nThat on his arm did carry / the son of Siegelind;\nFrom the steel the sparks flew hissing / as if were blowing fierce the\n      wind.",
        "457",
        "The mighty spear sharp-pointed / full through the shield did crash,\nThat ye from off the mail-rings / might see the lightning flash.\nBeneath its force they stumbled, / did both those men of might;\nBut for the sightless mantle / they both were killed there outright.",
        "458",
        "From mouth of the full doughty / Siegfried burst the blood.\nFull soon he yet recovered; / then seized the warrior good\nThe spear that from her strong arm / thus his shield had rent,\nAnd back with force as came it / the hand of doughty Siegfried sent.",
        "459",
        "He thought: “To pierce the maiden / were but small glory earned,\"\nAnd so the spear’s sharp edges / backward pointing turned;\nAgainst her mail-clad body / he made the shaft to bound,\nAnd with such might he sent it / full loud her armor did resound.",
        "460",
        "The sparks as if in stormwind / from mail-rings flew around.\nSo mightily did hurl it / the son of Siegmund\nThat she with all her power / could not the shaft withstand.\nIn sooth it ne’er was speeded / so swiftly by King Gunther’s hand.",
        "461",
        "But to her feet full sudden / had sprung Brunhild fair.\n“A shot, O noble Gunther, / befitting hero rare.\"\nShe weened himself had done it, / and all unaided he,\nNor wot she one far mightier / was thither come so secretly.",
        "462",
        "Then did she go full sudden, / wrathful was her mood,\nA stone full high she heaved / the noble maiden good,\nAnd the same far from her / with might and main she swung:\nHer armor’s mail-rings jingled / as she herself thereafter sprung.",
        "463",
        "The stone, when it had fallen, / lay fathoms twelve from there,\nAnd yet did spring beyond it / herself the maiden fair.\nThen where the stone was lying / thither Siegfried went:\nGunther feigned to move it, / but by another arm ’twas sent.",
        "464",
        "A valiant man was Siegfried / full powerful and tall.\nThe stone then cast he farther, / and farther sprang withal.\nFrom those his arts so cunning / had he of strength such store\nThat as he leaped he likewise / the weight of royal Gunther bore.",
        "465",
        "And when the leap was ended / and fallen was the stone,\nThen saw they ne’er another / but Gunther alone.\nBrunhild the fair maiden, / red grew she in wrath:\nSiegfried yet had warded / from royal Gunther surest death.",
        "466",
        "Unto her attendants / she spake in loud command,\nWhen she saw ’cross the circle / the king unvanquished stand.\n“Come hither quick, my kinsmen, / and ye that wait on me;\nHenceforth unto Gunther / shall all be pledged faithfully.”",
        "467",
        "Then laid the knights full valiant / their swords from out the hand;\nAt feet ’fore mighty Gunther / from Burgundian land\nOffered himself in service / full many a valiant knight.\nThey weened that he had conquered / in trial by his proper might.",
        "468",
        "He gave her loving greeting, / right courteous was he.\nThen by the hand she took him, / the maiden praiseworthy,\nIn pledge that all around him / was his to have and hold.\nWhereat rejoiced Hagen / the warrior valorous and bold.",
        "469",
        "Into the spacious palace / with her thence to go\nBade she the noble monarch. / When they had done so,\nThen still greater honors / unto the knight were shown.\nDankwart and Hagen, / right willingly they saw it done.",
        "470",
        "Siegfried the valiant, / by no means was he slow,\nHis sightless mantle did he / away in safety stow.\nThen went he again thither / where many a lady sat.\nHe spake unto the monarch– / full cunningly was done all that:",
        "471",
        "“Why bidest thus, my master? / Wilt not the play begin,\nTo which so oft hath challenged / thee the noble queen?\nLet us soon have example / what may the trial be.\"\nAs knew he naught about it, / did the knight thus cunningly.",
        "472",
        "Then spake the queen unto him: / “How hath this ever been,\nThat of the play, Sir Siegfried, / nothing thou hast seen,\nWherein hath been the victor / Gunther with mighty hand?\"\nThereto gave answer Hagen / a grim knight of Burgundian land.",
        "473",
        "Spake he: “There dost thou, Lady, / think ill without a cause:\nBy the ship down yonder / the noble Siegfried was,\nThe while the lord of Rhineland / in play did vanquish thee:\nThus knows he nothing of it,\" / spake Gunther’s warrior courteously.",
        "474",
        "“A joy to me these tidings,\" / the doughty Siegfried spoke,\n“That so thy haughty spirit / is brought beneath the yoke,\nAnd that yet one there liveth / master to be of thine.\nNow shalt thou, noble maiden, / us follow thither to the Rhine.”",
        "475",
        "Then spake the maiden shapely: / “It may not yet be so.\nAll my men and kindred / first the same must know.\nIn sooth not all so lightly / can I quit my home.\nFirst must I bid my trusty / warriors that they hither come.”",
        "476",
        "Then bade she messengers / quickly forth to ride,\nAnd summoned in her kindred / and men from every side.\nWithout delay she prayed them / to come to Isenstein,\nAnd bade them all be given / fit apparel rare and fine.",
        "477",
        "Then might ye see daily / ’twixt morn and eventide\nUnto Brunhild’s castle / many a knight to ride.\n“God wot, God wot,” quoth Hagen, / “we do an evil thing,\nTo tarry here while Brunhild / doth thus her men together bring.",
        "478",
        "“If now into this country / their good men they’ve brought\n–What thing the queen intendeth / thereof know we naught:\nBelike her wrath ariseth, / and we are men forlorn–\nThen to be our ruin / were the noble maiden born.”",
        "479",
        "Then spake the doughty Siegfried: / “That matter leave to me.\nWhereof thou now art fearful, / I’ll never let it be.\nReady help I’ll bring thee / hither unto this land,\nKnights of whom thou wotst not / till now I’ll bring, a chosen band.",
        "480",
        "“Of me shalt thou ask not: / from hence will I fare.\nMay God of thy good honor / meanwhile have a care.\nI come again right quickly / with a thousand men for thee,\nThe very best of warriors / hitherto are known to me.”",
        "481",
        "“Then tarry not unduly,\" / thus the monarch said.\n“Glad we are full fairly / of this thy timely aid.\"\nHe spake: “Till I come to thee / full short shall be my stay.\nThat thou thyself hast sent me / shalt thou unto Brunhild say.”",
