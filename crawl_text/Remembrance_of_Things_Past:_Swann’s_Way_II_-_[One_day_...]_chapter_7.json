        "One day, as I was weary of our usual place, beside the wooden horses,\nFrançoise had taken me for an excursion–across the frontier guarded at\nregular intervals by the little bastions of the barley-sugar women–into\nthose neighbouring but foreign regions, where the faces of the passers-by\nwere strange, where the goat-carriage went past; then she had gone away to\nlay down her things on a chair that stood with its back to a shrubbery of\nlaurels; while I waited for her I was pacing the broad lawn, of meagre\nclose-cropped grass already faded by the sun, dominated, at its far end,\nby a statue rising from a fountain, in front of which a little girl with\nreddish hair was playing with a shuttlecock; when, from the path, another\nlittle girl, who was putting on her cloak and covering up her battledore,\ncalled out sharply: “Good-bye, Gilberte, I’m going home now; don’t forget,\nwe’re coming to you this evening, after dinner.” The name Gilberte passed\nclose by me, evoking all the more forcibly her whom it labelled in that it\ndid not merely refer to her, as one speaks of a man in his absence, but\nwas directly addressed to her; it passed thus close by me, in action, so\nto speak, with a force that increased with the curve of its trajectory and\nas it drew near to its target;–carrying in its wake, I could feel, the\nknowledge, the impression of her to whom it was addressed that belonged\nnot to me but to the friend who called to her, everything that, while she\nuttered the words, she more or less vividly reviewed, possessed in her\nmemory, of their daily intimacy, of the visits that they paid to each\nother, of that unknown existence which was all the more inaccessible, all\nthe more painful to me from being, conversely, so familiar, so tractable\nto this happy girl who let her message brush past me without my being able\nto penetrate its surface, who flung it on the air with a light-hearted\ncry: letting float in the atmosphere the delicious attar which that\nmessage had distilled, by touching them with precision, from certain\ninvisible points in Mlle.  Swann’s life, from the evening to come, as it\nwould be, after dinner, at her home,–forming, on its celestial passage\nthrough the midst of the children and their nursemaids, a little cloud,\nexquisitely coloured, like the cloud that, curling over one of Poussin’s\ngardens, reflects minutely, like a cloud in the opera, teeming with\nchariots and horses, some apparition of the life of the gods; casting,\nfinally, on that ragged grass, at the spot on which she stood (at once a\nscrap of withered lawn and a moment in the afternoon of the fair player,\nwho continued to beat up and catch her shuttlecock until a governess, with\na blue feather in her hat, had called her away) a marvellous little band\nof light, of the colour of heliotrope, spread over the lawn like a carpet\non which I could not tire of treading to and fro with lingering feet,\nnostalgic and profane, while Françoise shouted: “Come on, button up your\ncoat, look, and let’s get away!” and I remarked for the first time how\ncommon her speech was, and that she had, alas, no blue feather in her hat.",
        "Only, would she come again to the Champs-Elysées? Next day she was not\nthere; but I saw her on the following days; I spent all my time revolving\nround the spot where she was at play with her friends, to such effect that\nonce, when, they found, they were not enough to make up a prisoner’s base,\nshe sent one of them to ask me if I cared to complete their side, and from\nthat day I played with her whenever she came. But this did not happen\nevery day; there were days when she had been prevented from coming by her\nlessons, by her catechism, by a luncheon-party, by the whole of that life,\nseparated from my own, which twice only, condensed into the name of\nGilberte, I had felt pass so painfully close to me, in the hawthorn lane\nnear Combray and on the grass of the Champs-Elysées.  On such days she\nwould have told us beforehand that we should not see her; if it were\nbecause of her lessons, she would say: “It is too tiresome, I sha’n’t be\nable to come to-morrow; you will all be enjoying yourselves here without\nme,” with an air of regret which to some extent consoled me; if, on the\nother hand, she had been invited to a party, and I, not knowing this,\nasked her whether she was coming to play with us, she would reply: “Indeed\nI hope not! Indeed I hope Mamma will let me go to my friend’s.” But on\nthese days I did at least know that I should not see her, whereas on\nothers, without any warning, her mother would take her for a drive, or\nsome such thing, and next day she would say: “Oh, yes! I went out with\nMamma,” as though it had been the most natural thing in the world, and not\nthe greatest possible misfortune for some one else. There were also the\ndays of bad weather on which her governess, afraid, on her own account, of\nthe rain, would not bring Gilberte to the Champs-Elysées.",
        "And so, if the heavens were doubtful, from early morning I would not cease\nto interrogate them, observing all the omens. If I saw the lady opposite,\njust inside her window, putting on her hat, I would say to myself: “That\nlady is going out; it must, therefore, be weather in which one can go out.\nWhy should not Gilberte do the same as that lady?” But the day grew dark.\nMy mother said that it might clear again, that one burst of sunshine would\nbe enough, but that more probably it would rain; and if it rained, of what\nuse would it be to go to the Champs-Elysées? And so, from breakfast-time,\nmy anxious eyes never left the uncertain, clouded sky.  It remained dark:\nOutside the window, the balcony was grey. Suddenly, on its sullen stone, I\ndid not indeed see a less negative colour, but I felt as it were an effort\ntowards a less negative colour, the pulsation of a hesitating ray that\nstruggled to discharge its light. A moment later the balcony was as pale\nand luminous as a standing water at dawn, and a thousand shadows from the\niron-work of its balustrade had come to rest on it. A breath of wind\ndispersed them; the stone grew dark again, but, like tamed creatures, they\nreturned; they began, imperceptibly, to grow lighter, and by one of those\ncontinuous crescendos, such as, in music, at the end of an overture, carry\na single note to the extreme fortissimo, making it pass rapidly through\nall the intermediate stages, I saw it attain to that fixed, unalterable\ngold of fine days, on which the sharply cut shadows of the wrought iron of\nthe balustrade were outlined in black like a capricious vegetation, with a\nfineness in the delineation of their smallest details which seemed to\nindicate a deliberate application, an artist’s satisfaction, and with so\nmuch relief, so velvety a bloom in the restfulness of their sombre and\nhappy mass that in truth those large and leafy shadows which lay reflected\non that lake of sunshine seemed aware that they were pledges of happiness\nand peace of mind.",
        "Brief, fading ivy, climbing, fugitive flora, the most colourless, the most\ndepressing, to many minds, of all that creep on walls or decorate windows;\nto me the dearest of them all, from the day when it appeared upon our\nbalcony, like the very shadow of the presence of Gilberte, who was perhaps\nalready in the Champs-Elysées, and as soon as I arrived there would greet\nme with: “Let’s begin at once. You are on my side.” Frail, swept away by a\nbreath, but at the same time in harmony, not with the season, with the\nhour; a promise of that immediate pleasure which the day will deny or\nfulfil, and thereby of the one paramount immediate pleasure, the pleasure\nof loving and of being loved; more soft, more warm upon tie stone than\neven moss is; alive, a ray of sunshine sufficing for its birth, and for\nthe birth of joy, even in the heart of winter.",
        "And on those days when all other vegetation had disappeared, when the fine\njerkins of green leather which covered the trunks of the old trees were\nhidden beneath the snow; after the snow had ceased to fall, but when the\nsky was still too much overcast for me to hope that Gilberte would venture\nout, then suddenly–inspiring my mother to say: “Look, it’s quite fine\nnow; I think you might perhaps try going to the Champs-Elysées after\nall.\"–On the mantle of snow that swathed the balcony, the sun had\nappeared and was stitching seams of gold, with embroidered patches of dark\nshadow. That day we found no one there, or else a solitary girl, on the\npoint of departure, who assured me that Gilberte was not coming. The\nchairs, deserted by the imposing but uninspiring company of governesses,\nstood empty. Only, near the grass, was sitting a lady of uncertain age who\ncame in all weathers, dressed always in an identical style, splendid and\nsombre, to make whose acquaintance I would have, at that period,\nsacrificed, had it lain in my power, all the greatest opportunities in my\nlife to come. For Gilberte went up every day to speak to her; she used to\nask Gilberte for news of her “dearest mother” and it struck me that, if I\nhad known her, I should have been for Gilberte some one wholly different,\nsome one who knew people in her parents’ world. While her grandchildren\nplayed together at a little distance, she would sit and read the Débats,\nwhich she called “My old Débats!” as, with an aristocratic familiarity,\nshe would say, speaking of the police-sergeant or the woman who let the\nchairs, “My old friend the police-sergeant,” or “The chair-keeper and I,\nwho are old friends.”",
        "Françoise found it too cold to stand about, so we walked to the Pont de la\nConcorde to see the Seine frozen over, on to which everyone, even\nchildren, walked fearlessly, as though upon an enormous whale, stranded,\ndefenceless, and about to be cut up. We returned to the Champs-Elysées; I\nwas growing sick with misery between the motionless wooden horses and the\nwhite lawn, caught in a net of black paths from which the snow had been\ncleared, while the statue that surmounted it held in its hand a long\npendent icicle which seemed to explain its gesture. The old lady herself,\nhaving folded up her Débats, asked a passing nursemaid the time,\nthanking her with “How very good of you!” then begged the road-sweeper to\ntell her grandchildren to come, as she felt cold, adding “A thousand\nthanks. I am sorry to give you so much trouble!” Suddenly the sky was rent\nin two: between the punch-and-judy and the horses, against the opening\nhorizon, I had just seen, like a miraculous sign, Mademoiselle’s blue\nfeather. And now Gilberte was running at full speed towards me, sparkling\nand rosy beneath a cap trimmed with fur, enlivened by the cold, by being\nlate, by her anxiety for a game; shortly before she reached me, she\nslipped on a piece of ice and, either to regain her balance, or because it\nappeared to her graceful, or else pretending that she was on skates, it\nwas with outstretched arms that she smilingly advanced, as though to\nembrace me. “Bravo! bravo! that’s splendid; ’topping,’ I should say, like\nyou–’sporting,’ I suppose I ought to say, only I’m a hundred-and-one, a\nwoman of the old school,” exclaimed the lady, uttering, on behalf of the\nvoiceless Champs-Elysées, their thanks to Gilberte for having come,\nwithout letting herself be frightened away by the weather. “You are like\nme, faithful at all costs to our old Champs-Elysées; we are two brave\nsouls!  You wouldn’t believe me, I dare say, if I told you that I love\nthem, even like this. This snow (I know, you’ll laugh at me), it makes me\nthink of ermine!” And the old lady began to laugh herself.",
        "The first of these days–to which the snow, a symbol of the powers that\nwere able to deprive me of the sight of Gilberte, imparted the sadness of\na day of separation, almost the aspect of a day of departure, because it\nchanged the outward form and almost forbade the use of the customary scene\nof our only encounters, now altered, covered, as it were, in\ndust-sheets–that day, none the less, marked a stage in the progress of my\nlove, for it was, in a sense, the first sorrow that she was to share with\nme. There were only our two selves of our little company, and to be thus\nalone with her was not merely like a beginning of intimacy, but also on\nher part–as though she had come there solely to please me, and in such\nweather–it seemed to me as touching as if, on one of those days on which\nshe had been invited to a party, she had given it up in order to come to\nme in the Champs-Elysées; I acquired more confidence in the vitality, in\nthe future of a friendship which could remain so much alive amid the\ntorpor, the solitude, the decay of our surroundings; and while she dropped\npellets of snow down my neck, I smiled lovingly at what seemed to me at\nonce a predilection that she shewed for me in thus tolerating me as her\ntravelling companion in this new, this wintry land, and a sort of loyalty\nto me which she preserved through evil times. Presently, one after\nanother, like shyly bopping sparrows, her friends arrived, black against\nthe snow. We got ready to play and, since this day which had begun so\nsadly was destined to end in joy, as I went up, before the game started,\nto the friend with the sharp voice whom I had heard, that first day,\ncalling Gilberte by name, she said to me: “No, no, I’m sure you’d much\nrather be in Gilberte’s camp; besides, look, she’s signalling to you.” She\nwas in fact summoning me to cross the snowy lawn to her camp, to ’take the\nfield,’ which the sun, by casting over it a rosy gleam, the metallic\nlustre of old and worn brocades, had turned into a Field of the Cloth of\nGold.",
        "This day, which I had begun with so many misgivings, was, as it happened,\none of the few on which I was not unduly wretched.",
        "For, although I no longer thought, now, of anything save not to let a\nsingle day pass without seeing Gilberte (so much so that once, when my\ngrandmother had not come home by dinner-time, I could not resist the\ninstinctive reflection that, if she had been run over in the street and\nkilled, I should not for some time be allowed to play in the\nChamps-Elysées; when one is in love one has no love left for anyone), yet\nthose moments which I spent in her company, for which I had waited with so\nmuch impatience all night and morning, for which I had quivered with\nexcitement, to which I would have sacrificed everything else in the world,\nwere by no means happy moments; well did I know it, for they were the only\nmoments in my life on which I concentrated a scrupulous, undistracted\nattention, and yet I could not discover in them one atom of pleasure. All\nthe time that I was away from Gilberte, I wanted to see her, because,\nhaving incessantly sought to form a mental picture of her, I was unable,\nin the end, to do so, and did not know exactly to what my love\ncorresponded.  Besides, she had never yet told me that she loved me. Far\nfrom it, she had often boasted that she knew other little boys whom she\npreferred to myself, that I was a good companion, with whom she was always\nwilling to play, although I was too absent-minded, not attentive enough to\nthe game. Moreover, she had often shewn signs of apparent coldness towards\nme, which might have shaken my faith that I was for her a creature\ndifferent from the rest, had that faith been founded upon a love that\nGilberte had felt for me, and not, as was the case, upon the love that I\nfelt for her, which strengthened its resistance to the assaults of doubt\nby making it depend entirely upon the manner in which I was obliged, by an\ninternal compulsion, to think of Gilberte. But my feelings with regard to\nher I had never yet ventured to express to her in words. Of course, on\nevery page of my exercise-books, I wrote out, in endless repetition, her\nname and address, but at the sight of those vague lines which I might\ntrace, without her having to think, on that account, of me, I felt\ndiscouraged, because they spoke to me, not of Gilberte, who would never so\nmuch as see them, but of my own desire, which they seemed to shew me in\nits true colours, as something purely personal, unreal, tedious and\nineffective. The most important thing was that we should see each other,\nGilberte and I, and should have an opportunity of making a mutual\nconfession of our love which, until then, would not officially (so to\nspeak) have begun. Doubtless the various reasons which made me so\nimpatient to see her would have appeared less urgent to a grown man. As\nlife goes on, we acquire such adroitness in the culture of our pleasures,\nthat we content ourselves with that which we derive from thinking of a\nwoman, as I was thinking of Gilberte, without troubling ourselves to\nascertain whether the image corresponds to the reality,–and with the\npleasure of loving her, without needing to be sure, also, that she loves\nus; or again that we renounce the pleasure of confessing our passion for\nher, so as to preserve and enhance the passion that she has for us, like\nthose Japanese gardeners who, to obtain one perfect blossom, will\nsacrifice the rest. But at the period when I was in love with Gilberte, I\nstill believed that Love did really exist, apart from ourselves; that,\nallowing us, at the most, to surmount the obstacles in our way, it offered\nus its blessings in an order in which we were not free to make the least\nalteration; it seemed to me that if I had, on my own initiative,\nsubstituted for the sweetness of a confession a pretence of indifference,\nI should not only have been depriving myself of one of the joys of which I\nhad most often dreamed, I should have been fabricating, of my own free\nwill, a love that was artificial and without value, that bore no relation\nto the truth, whose mysterious and foreordained ways I should thus have\nbeen declining to follow.",
        "But when I arrived at the Champs-Elysées,–and, as at first sight it\nappeared, was in a position to confront my love, so as to make it undergo\nthe necessary modifications, with its living and independent cause–as\nsoon as I was in the presence of that Gilberte Swann on the sight of whom\nI had counted to revive the images that my tired memory had lost and could\nnot find again, of that Gilberte Swann with whom I had been playing the\nday before, and whom I had just been prompted to greet, and then to\nrecognise, by a blind instinct like that which, when we are walking, sets\none foot before the other, without giving us time to think what we are\ndoing, then at once it became as though she and the little girl who had\ninspired my dreams had been two different people. If, for instance, I had\nretained in my memory overnight two fiery eyes above plump and rosy\ncheeks, Gilberte’s face would now offer me (and with emphasis) something\nthat I distinctly had not remembered, a certain sharpening and\nprolongation of the nose which, instantaneously associating itself with\ncertain others of her features, assumed the importance of those\ncharacteristics which, in natural history, are used to define a species,\nand transformed her into a little girl of the kind that have sharpened\nprofiles.  While I was making myself ready to take advantage of this long\nexpected moment, and to surrender myself to the impression of Gilberte\nwhich I had prepared beforehand but could no longer find in my head, to an\nextent which would enable me, during the long hours which I must spend\nalone, to be certain that it was indeed herself whom I had in mind, that\nit was indeed my love for her that I was gradually making grow, as a book\ngrows when one is writing it, she threw me a ball; and, like the idealist\nphilosopher whose body takes account of the external world in the reality\nof which his intellect declines to believe, the same self which had made\nme salute her before I had identified her now urged me to catch the ball\nthat she tossed to me (as though she had been a companion, with whom I had\ncome to play, and not a sister-soul with whom my soul had come to be\nlimited), made me, out of politeness, until the time came when she had to\nI go, address a thousand polite and trivial remarks to her, and so\nprevented me both from keeping a silence in which I might at last have\nlaid my hand upon the indispensable, escaped idea, and from uttering the\nwords which might have made that definite progress in the course of our\nlove on which I was always obliged to count only for the following\nafternoon. There was, however, an occasional development. One day, we had\ngone with Gilberte to the stall of our own special vendor, who was always\nparticularly nice to us, since it was to her that M. Swann used to send\nfor his gingerbread, of which, for reasons of health (he suffered from a\nracial eczema, and from the constipation of the prophets), he consumed a\ngreat quantity,–Gilberte pointed out to me with a laugh two little boys\nwho were like the little artist and the little naturalist in the\nchildren’s storybooks. For one of them would not have a red stick of rock\nbecause he preferred the purple, while the other, with tears in his eyes,\nrefused a plum which his nurse was buying for him, because, as he finally\nexplained in passionate tones: “I want the other plum; it’s got a worm in\nit!” I purchased two ha’penny marbles. With admiring eyes I saw, luminous\nand imprisoned in a bowl by themselves, the agate marbles which seemed\nprecious to me because they were as fair and smiling as little girls, and\nbecause they cost five-pence each. Gilberte, who was given a great deal\nmore pocket money than I ever had, asked me which I thought the prettiest.\nThey were as transparent, as liquid-seeming as life itself. I would not\nhave had her sacrifice a single one of them. I should have liked her to be\nable to buy them, to liberate them all. Still, I pointed out one that had\nthe same colour as her eyes. Gilberte took it, turned it about until it\nshone with a ray of gold, fondled it, paid its ransom, but at once handed\nme her captive, saying: “Take it; it is for you, I give it to you, keep it\nto remind yourself of me.”",
        "Another time, being still obsessed by the desire to hear Berma in classic\ndrama, I had asked her whether she had not a copy of a pamphlet in which\nBergotte spoke of Racine, and which was now out of print. She had told me\nto let her know the exact title of it, and that evening I had sent her a\nlittle telegram, writing on its envelope the name, Gilberte Swann, which I\nhad so often, traced in my exercise-books.  Next day she brought me in a\nparcel tied with pink bows and sealed with white wax, the pamphlet, a copy\nof which she had managed to find. “You see, it is what you asked me for,\"\nshe said, taking from her muff the telegram that I had sent her.  But in\nthe address on the pneumatic message–which, only yesterday, was nothing,\nwas merely a ’little blue’ that I had written, and, after a messenger had\ndelivered it to Gilberte’s porter and a servant had taken it to her in her\nroom, had become a thing without value or distinction, one of the ’little\nblues’ that she had received in the course of the day–I had difficulty in\nrecognising the futile, straggling lines of my own handwriting beneath the\ncircles stamped on it at the post-office, the inscriptions added in pencil\nby a postman, signs of effectual realisation, seals of the external world,\nviolet bands symbolical of life itself, which for the first time came to\nespouse, to maintain, to raise, to rejoice my dream.",
        "And there was another day on which she said to me: “You know, you may call\nme ’Gilberte’; in any case, I’m going to call you by your first name. It’s\ntoo silly not to.” Yet she continued for a while to address me by the more\nformal ’vous,’ and, when I drew her attention to this, smiled, and\ncomposing, constructing a phrase like those that are put into the\ngrammar-books of foreign languages with no other object than to teach us\nto make use of a new word, ended it with my Christian name. And when I\nrecalled, later, what I had felt at the time, I could distinguish the\nimpression of having been held, for a moment, in her mouth, myself, naked,\nwithout, any longer, any of the social qualifications which belonged\nequally to her other companions and, when she used my surname, to my\nparents, accessories of which her lips–by the effort that she made, a\nlittle after her father’s manner, to articulate the words to which she\nwished to give a special value–had the air of stripping, of divesting me,\nas one peels the skin from a fruit of which one is going to put only the\npulp into one’s mouth, while her glance, adapting itself to the same new\ndegree of intimacy as her speech, fell on me also more directly, not\nwithout testifying to the consciousness, the pleasure, even the gratitude\nthat it felt, accompanying itself with a smile.",
        "But at that actual moment, I was not able to appreciate the worth of these\nnew pleasures. They were given, not by the little girl whom I loved, to me\nwho loved her, but by the other, her with whom I used to play, to my other\nself, who possessed neither the memory of the true Gilberte, nor the fixed\nheart which alone could have known the value of a happiness for which it\nalone had longed. Even after I had returned home I did not taste them,\nsince, every day, the necessity which made me hope that on the morrow I\nshould arrive at the clear, calm, happy contemplation of Gilberte, that\nshe would at last confess her love for me, explaining to me the reasons by\nwhich she had been obliged, hitherto, to conceal it, that same necessity\nforced me to regard the past as of no account, to look ahead of me only,\nto consider the little advantages that she had given me not in themselves\nand as if they were self-sufficient, but like fresh rungs of the ladder on\nwhich I might set my feet, which were going to allow me to advance a step\nfurther and finally to attain the happiness which I had not yet\nencountered.",
        "If, at times, she shewed me these marks of her affection, she troubled me\nalso by seeming not to be pleased to see me, and this happened often on\nthe very days on which I had most counted for the realisation of my hopes.\nI was sure that Gilberte was coming to the Champs-Elysées, and I felt an\nelation which seemed merely the anticipation of a great happiness\nwhen–going into the drawing-room in the morning to kiss Mamma, who was\nalready dressed to go out, the coils of her black hair elaborately built\nup, and her beautiful hands, plump and white, fragrant still with soap–I\nhad been apprised, by seeing a column of dust standing by itself in the\nair above the piano, and by hearing a barrel-organ playing, beneath the\nwindow, En revenant de la revue, that the winter had received, until\nnightfall, an unexpected, radiant visit from a day of spring. While we sat\nat luncheon, by opening her window, the lady opposite had sent packing, in\nthe twinkling of an eye, from beside my chair–to sweep in a single stride\nover the whole width of our dining-room–a sunbeam which had lain down\nthere for its midday rest and returned to continue it there a moment\nlater.  At school, during the one o’clock lesson, the sun made me sick\nwith impatience and boredom as it let fall a golden stream that crept to\nthe edge of my desk, like an invitation to the feast at which I could not\nmyself arrive before three o’clock, until the moment when Françoise came\nto fetch me at the school-gate, and we made our way towards the\nChamps-Elysées through streets decorated with sunlight, dense with people,\nover which the balconies, detached by the sun and made vaporous, seemed to\nfloat in front of the houses like clouds of gold. Alas! in the\nChamps-Elysées I found no Gilberte; she had not yet arrived. Motionless,\non the lawn nurtured by the invisible sun which, here and there, kindled\nto a flame the point of a blade of grass, while the pigeons that had\nalighted upon it had the appearance of ancient sculptures which the\ngardener’s pick had heaved to the surface of a hallowed soil, I stood with\nmy eyes fixed on the horizon, expecting at every moment to see appear the\nform of Gilberte following that of her governess, behind the statue that\nseemed to be holding out the child, which it had in its arms, and which\nglistened in the stream of light, to receive benediction from the sun. The\nold lady who read the Débats was sitting on her chair, in her invariable\nplace, and had just accosted a park-keeper, with a friendly wave of her\nhands towards him as she exclaimed “What a lovely day!” And when the\nchair-woman came up to collect her penny, with an infinity of smirks and\naffectations she folded the ticket away inside her glove, as though it had\nbeen a posy of flowers, for which she had sought, in gratitude to the\ndonor, the most becoming place upon her person. When she had found it, she\nperformed a circular movement with her neck, straightened her boa, and\nfastened upon the collector, as she shewed her the end of yellow paper\nthat stuck out over her bare wrist, the bewitching smile with which a\nwoman says to a young man, pointing to her bosom: “You see, I’m wearing\nyour roses!”",
        "I dragged Françoise, on the way towards Gilberte, as far as the Arc de\nTriomphe; we did not meet her, and I was returning towards the lawn\nconvinced, now, that she was not coming, when, in front of the wooden\nhorses, the little girl with the sharp voice flung herself upon me:\n“Quick, quick, Gilberte’s been here a quarter of an hour. She’s just\ngoing. We’ve been waiting for you, to make up a prisoner’s base.”",
        "While I had been going up the Avenue des Champs-Elysées, Gilberte had\narrived by the Rue Boissy-d’Anglas, Mademoiselle having taken advantage of\nthe fine weather to go on some errand of her own; and M. Swann was coming\nto fetch his daughter. And so it was my fault; I ought not to have strayed\nfrom the lawn; for one never knew for certain from what direction Gilberte\nwould appear, whether she would be early or late, and this perpetual\ntension succeeded in making more impressive not only the Champs-Elysées in\ntheir entirety, and the whole span of the afternoon, like a vast expanse\nof space and time, on every point and at every moment of which it was\npossible that the form of Gilberte might appear, but also that form\nitself, since behind its appearance I felt that there lay concealed the\nreason for which it had shot its arrow into my heart at four o’clock\ninstead of at half-past two; crowned with a smart hat, for paying calls,\ninstead of the plain cap, for games; in front of the Ambassadeurs and not\nbetween the two puppet-shows; I divined one of those occupations in which\nI might not follow Gilberte, occupations that forced her to go out or to\nstay at home, I was in contact with the mystery of her unknown life.  It\nwas this mystery, too, which troubled me when, running at the sharp-voiced\ngirl’s bidding, so as to begin our game without more delay, I saw\nGilberte, so quick and informal with us, make a ceremonious bow to the old\nlady with the Débats (who acknowledged it with “What a lovely sun!\nYou’d think there was a fire burning.”) speaking to her with a shy smile,\nwith an air of constraint which called to my mind the other little girl\nthat Gilberte must be when at home with her parents, or with friends of\nher parents, paying visits, in all the rest, that escaped me, of her\nexistence. But of that existence no one gave me so strong an impression as\ndid M. Swann, who came a little later to fetch his daughter. That was\nbecause he and Mme.  Swann–inasmuch as their daughter lived with them, as\nher lessons, her games, her friendships depended upon them–contained for\nme, like Gilberte, perhaps even more than Gilberte, as befitted subjects\nthat had an all-powerful control over her in whom it must have had its\nsource, an undefined, an inaccessible quality of melancholy charm.\nEverything that concerned them was on my part the object of so constant a\npreoccupation that the days on which, as on this day, M. Swann (whom I had\nseen so often, long ago, without his having aroused my curiosity, when he\nwas still on good terms with my parents) came for Gilberte to the\nChamps-Elysées, once the pulsations to which my heart had been excited by\nthe appearance of his grey hat and hooded cape had subsided, the sight of\nhim still impressed me as might that of an historic personage, upon whom\none had just been studying a series of books, and the smallest details of\nwhose life one learned with enthusiasm. His relations with the Comte de\nParis, which, when I heard them discussed at Combray, seemed to me\nunimportant, became now in my eyes something marvellous, as if no one else\nhad ever known the House of Orleans; they set him in vivid detachment\nagainst the vulgar background of pedestrians of different classes, who\nencumbered that particular path in the Champs-Elysées, in the midst of\nwhom I admired his condescending to figure without claiming any special\ndeference, which as it happened none of them dreamed of paying him, so\nprofound was the incognito in which he was wrapped.",
        "He responded politely to the salutations of Gilberte’s companions, even to\nmine, for all that he was no longer on good terms with my family, but\nwithout appearing to know who I was. (This reminded me that he had\nconstantly seen me in the country; a memory which I had retained, but kept\nout of sight, because, since I had seen Gilberte again, Swann had become\nto me pre-eminently her father, and no longer the Combray Swann; as the\nideas which, nowadays, I made his name connote were different from the\nideas in the system of which it was formerly comprised, which I utilised\nnot at all now when I had occasion to think of him, he had become a new,\nanother person; still I attached him by an artificial thread, secondary\nand transversal, to our former guest; and as nothing had any longer any\nvalue for me save in the extent to which my love might profit by it, it\nwas with a spasm of shame and of regret at not being able to erase them\nfrom my memory that I recaptured the years in which, in the eyes of this\nsame Swann who was at this moment before me in the Champs-Elysées, and to\nwhom, fortunately, Gilberte had perhaps not mentioned my name, I had so\noften, in the evenings, made myself ridiculous by sending to ask Mamma to\ncome upstairs to my room to say good-night to me, while she was drinking\ncoffee with him and my father and my grandparents at the table in the\ngarden.) He told Gilberte that she might play one game; he could wait for\na quarter of an hour; and, sitting down, just like anyone else, on an iron\nchair, paid for his ticket with that hand which Philippe VII had so often\nheld in his own, while we began our game upon the lawn, scattering the\npigeons, whose beautiful, iridescent bodies (shaped like hearts and,\nsurely, the lilacs of the feathered kingdom) took refuge as in so many\nsanctuaries, one on the great basin of stone, on which its beak, as it\ndisappeared below the rim, conferred the part, assigned the purpose of\noffering to the bird in abundance the fruit or grain at which it appeared\nto be pecking, another on the head of the statue, which it seemed to crown\nwith one of those enamelled objects whose polychrome varies in certain\nclassical works the monotony of the stone, and with an attribute which,\nwhen the goddess bears it, entitles her to a particular epithet and makes\nof her, as a different Christian name makes of a mortal, a fresh divinity.",
        "On one of these sunny days which had not realised my hopes, I had not the\ncourage to conceal my disappointment from Gilberte.",
        "“I had ever so many things to ask you,” I said to her; “I thought that\nto-day was going to mean so much in our friendship. And no sooner have you\ncome than you go away! Try to come early to-morrow, so that I can talk to\nyou.”",
        "Her face lighted up and she jumped for joy as she answered: “Tomorrow, you\nmay make up your mind, my dear friend, I sha’n’t come!",
        "“First of all I’ve a big luncheon-party; then in the afternoon I am going\nto a friend’s house to see King Theodosius arrive from her windows; won’t\nthat be splendid?–and then, next day, I’m going to Michel Strogoff, and\nafter that it will soon be Christmas, and the New Year holidays! Perhaps\nthey’ll take me south, to the Riviera; won’t that be nice? Though I should\nmiss the Christmas-tree here; anyhow, if I do stay in Paris, I sha’n’t be\ncoming here, because I shall be out paying calls with Mamma.\nGood-bye–there’s Papa calling me.”",
        "I returned home with Françoise through streets that were still gay with\nsunshine, as on the evening of a holiday when the merriment is over. I\ncould scarcely drag my legs along.",
        "“I’m not surprised;” said Françoise, “it’s not the right weather for the\ntime of year; it’s much too warm. Oh dear, oh dear, to think of all the\npoor sick people there must be everywhere; you would think that up there,\ntoo, everything’s got out of order.”",
        "I repeated to myself, stifling my sobs, the words in which Gilberte had\ngiven utterance to her joy at the prospect of not coming back, for a long\ntime, to the Champs-Elysées. But already the charm with which, by the mere\nact of thinking, my mind was filled as soon as it thought of her, the\nprivileged position, unique even if it were painful, in which I was\ninevitably placed in relation to Gilberte by the contraction of a scar in\nmy mind, had begun to add to that very mark of her indifference something\nromantic, and in the midst of my tears my lips would shape themselves in a\nsmile which was indeed the timid outline of a kiss. And when the time came\nfor the postman I said to myself, that evening as on every other: “I am\ngoing to have a letter from Gilberte, she is going to tell me, at last,\nthat she has never ceased to love me, and to explain to me the mysterious\nreason by which she has been forced to conceal her love from me until now,\nto put on the appearance of being able to be happy without seeing me; the\nreason for which she has assumed the form of the other Gilberte, who is\nsimply a companion.”",
        "Every evening I would beguile myself into imagining this letter, believing\nthat I was actually reading it, reciting each of its sentences in turn.\nSuddenly I would stop, in alarm. I had realised that, if I was to receive\na letter from Gilberte, it could not, in any case, be this letter, since\nit was I myself who had just composed it. And from that moment I would\nstrive to keep my thoughts clear of the words which I should have liked\nher to write to me, from fear lest, by first selecting them myself, I\nshould be excluding just those identical words,–the dearest, the most\ndesired–from the field of possible events. Even if, by an almost\nimpossible coincidence, it had been precisely the letter of my invention\nthat Gilberte had addressed to me of her own accord, recognising my own\nwork in it I should not have had the impression that I was receiving\nsomething that had not originated in myself, something real, something\nnew, a happiness external to my mind, independent of my will, a gift\nindeed from love.",
        "While I waited I read over again a page which, although it had not been\nwritten to me by Gilberte, came to me, none the less, from her, that page\nby Bergotte upon the beauty of the old myths from which Racine drew his\ninspiration, which (with the agate marble) I always kept within reach.  I\nwas touched by my friend’s kindness in having procured the book for me;\nand as everyone is obliged to find some reason for his passion, so much so\nthat he is glad to find in the creature whom he loves qualities which (he\nhas learned by reading or in conversation) are worthy to excite a man’s\nlove, that he assimilates them by imitation and makes out of them fresh\nreasons for his love, even although these qualities be diametrically\nopposed to those for which his love would have sought, so long as it was\nspontaneous–as Swann, before my day, had sought to establish the\naesthetic basis of Odette’s beauty–I, who had at first loved Gilberte, in\nCombray days, on account of all the unknown element in her life into which\nI would fain have plunged headlong, have undergone reincarnation,\ndiscarding my own separate existence as a thing that no longer mattered, I\nthought now, as of an inestimable advantage, that of this, my own, my too\nfamiliar, my contemptible existence Gilberte might one day become the\nhumble servant, the kindly, the comforting collaborator, who in the\nevenings, helping me in my work, would collate for me the texts of rare\npamphlets. As for Bergotte, that infinitely wise, almost divine old man,\nbecause of whom I had first, before I had even seen her, loved Gilberte,\nnow it was for Gilberte’s sake, chiefly, that I loved him. With as much\npleasure as the pages that he had written about Racine, I studied the\nwrapper, folded under great seals of white wax and tied with billows of\npink ribbon, in which she had brought those pages to me. I kissed the\nagate marble, which was the better part of my love’s heart, the part that\nwas not frivolous but faithful, and, for all that it was adorned with the\nmysterious charm of Gilberte’s life, dwelt close beside me, inhabited my\nchamber, shared my bed. But the beauty of that stone, and the beauty also\nof those pages of Bergotte which I was glad to associate with the idea of\nmy love for Gilberte, as if, in the moments when my love seemed no longer\nto have any existence, they gave it a kind of consistency, were, I\nperceived, anterior to that love, which they in no way resembled; their\nelements had been determined by the writer’s talent, or by geological\nlaws, before ever Gilberte had known me, nothing in book or stone would\nhave been different if Gilberte had not loved me, and there was nothing,\nconsequently, that authorised me to read in them a message of happiness.\nAnd while my love, incessantly waiting for the morrow to bring a\nconfession of Gilberte’s love for me, destroyed, unravelled every evening,\nthe ill-done work of the day, in some shadowed part of my being was an\nunknown weaver who would not leave where they lay the severed threads, but\ncollected and rearranged them, without any thought of pleasing me, or of\ntoiling for my advantage, in the different order which she gave to all her\nhandiwork.  Without any special interest in my love, not beginning by\ndeciding that I was loved, she placed, side by side, those of Gilberte’s\nactions that had seemed to me inexplicable and her faults which I had\nexcused. Then, one with another, they took on a meaning. It seemed to tell\nme, this new arrangement, that when I saw Gilberte, instead of coming to\nme in the Champs-Elysées, going to a party, or on errands with her\ngoverness, when I saw her prepared for an absence that would extend over\nthe New Year holidays, I was wrong in thinking, in saying: “It is because\nshe is frivolous,” or “easily lead.” For she would have ceased to be\neither if she had loved me, and if she had been forced to obey it would\nhave been with the same despair in her heart that I felt on the days when\nI did not see her. It shewed me further, this new arrangement, that I\nought, after all, to know what it was to love, since I loved Gilberte; it\ndrew my attention to the constant anxiety that I had to ’shew off’ before\nher, by reason of which I tried to persuade my mother to get for Françoise\na waterproof coat and a hat with a blue feather, or, better still, to stop\nsending with me to the Champs-Elysées an attendant with whom I blushed to\nbe seen (to all of which my mother replied that I was not fair to\nFrançoise, that she was an excellent woman and devoted to us all) and also\nthat sole, exclusive need to see Gilberte, the result of which was that,\nmonths in advance, I could think of nothing but how to find out at what\ndate she would be leaving Paris and where she was going, feeling that the\nmost attractive country in the world would be but a place of exile if she\nwere not to be there, and asking only to be allowed to stay for ever in\nParis, so long as I might see her in the Champs-Elysées; and it had little\ndifficulty in making me see that neither my anxiety nor my need could be\njustified by anything in Gilberte’s conduct. She, on the contrary, was\ngenuinely fond of her governess, without troubling herself over what I\nmight choose to think about it. It seemed quite natural to her not to come\nto the Champs-Elysées if she had to go shopping with Mademoiselle,\ndelightful if she had to go out somewhere with her mother. And even\nsupposing that she would ever have allowed me to spend my holidays in the\nsame place as herself, when it came to choosing that place she considered\nher parents’ wishes, a thousand different amusements of which she had been\ntold, and not at all that it should be the place to which my family were\nproposing to send me. When she assured me (as sometimes happened) that she\nliked me less than some other of her friends, less than she had liked me\nthe day before, because by my clumsiness I had made her side lose a game,\nI would beg her pardon, I would beg her to tell me what I must do in order\nthat she should begin again to like me as much as, or more than the rest;\nI hoped to hear her say that that was already my position; I besought her;\nas though she had been able to modify her affection for me as she or I\nchose, to give me pleasure, merely by the words that she would utter, as\nmy good or bad conduct should deserve. Was I, then, not yet aware that\nwhat I felt, myself, for her, depended neither upon her actions nor upon\nmy desires?",
        "It shewed me finally, the new arrangement planned by my unseen weaver,\nthat, if we find ourselves hoping that the actions of a person who has\nhitherto caused us anxiety may prove not to have been sincere, they shed\nin their wake a light which our hopes are powerless to extinguish, a light\nto which, rather than to our hopes, we must put the question, what will be\nthat person’s actions on the morrow.",
        "These new counsels, my love listened and heard them; they persuaded it\nthat the morrow would not be different from all the days that had gone\nbefore; that Gilberte’s feeling for me, too long established now to be\ncapable of alteration, was indifference; that hi my friendship with\nGilberte, it was I alone who loved. “That is true,” my love responded,\n“there is nothing more to be made of that friendship. It will not alter\nnow.” And so the very next day (unless I were to wait for a public\nholiday, if there was one approaching, some anniversary, the New Year,\nperhaps, one of those days which are not like other days, on which time\nstarts afresh, casting aside the heritage of the past, declining its\nlegacy of sorrows) I would appeal to Gilberte to terminate our old and to\njoin me in laying the foundations of a new friendship.",
