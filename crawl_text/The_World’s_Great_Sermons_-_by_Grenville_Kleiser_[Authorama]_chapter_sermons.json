        "Thomas Hooker, graduate and fellow of Cambridge, England, and\npractically founder of Connecticut, was born in 1586. He was dedicated\nto the ministry, and began his activities in 1620 by taking a small\nparish in Surrey. He did not, however, attract much notice for his\npowerful advocacy of reformed doctrine, until 1629, when he was cited\nto appear before Laud, the Bishop of London, whose threats induced him\nto leave England for Holland, whence he sailed with John Cotton, in\n1633, for New England, and settled in Newtown, now Cambridge, Mass.",
        "Chiefly in consequence of disagreements between his own and Cotton’s\ncongregation he, with a large following, migrated in 1636 to the\nConnecticut Valley, where the little band made their center at\nHartford. Hooker was the inspirer if not the author of the Fundamental\nLaws and was of wide political as well as religious influence in\norganizing “The United Colonies of New England” in 1643–the first\neffort after federal government made on this continent. He was an\nactive preacher and prolific writer up to his death in 1647.",

        "THE ACTIVITY OF FAITH; OR, ABRAHAM’S IMITATORS",
        "And the father of circumcision to them who are not of circumcision\nonly, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father\nAbraham, which he had, being yet uncircumcized.–Romans iv., 12.",
        "I proceed now to show who those are, that may, and do indeed, receive\nbenefit as Abraham did. The text saith, “They that walk in the steps\nof that faith of Abraham:” that man that not only enjoyeth the\nprivileges of the Church, but yieldeth the obedience of faith,\naccording to the Word of God revealed, and walketh in obedience,\nthat man alone shall be blest with faithful Abraham.",
        "Two points may be here raised, but I shall hardly handle them both;\ntherefore I will pass over the first only with a touch, and that lieth\nclosely couched in the text.",
        "That faith causeth fruitfulness in the hearts and lives of those in\nwhom it is.",
        "Mark what I say: a faithful man is a fruitful man; faith enableth\na man to be doing. Ask the question, by what power was it whereby\nAbraham was enabled to yield obedience to the Lord? The text answereth\nyou, “They that walk in the footsteps” not of Abraham, but “in the\nfootsteps of the faith of Abraham.” A man would have thought the text\nshould have run thus: They that walk in the footsteps of Abraham. That\nis true, too, but the apostle had another end; therefore he saith,\n\"They that walk in the footsteps of the faith of Abraham,” implying\nthat it was the grace of faith that God bestowed on Abraham, that\nquickened and enabled him to perform every duty that God required of\nhim, and called him to the performance of. So that I say, the question\nbeing, whence came it that Abraham was so fruitful a Christian, what\nenabled him to do and to suffer what he did? surely it was faith that\nwas the cause that produced such effects, that helped him to perform\nsuch actions. The point then you see is evident, faith it is that\ncauseth fruit.",
        "Hence it is, that of almost all the actions that a Christian hath to\ndo, faith is still said to be the worker. If a man pray as he should,\nit is “the prayer of faith.” If a man obey as he should, it is the\nobedience of faith. If a man war in the Church militant, it is “the\nfight of faith.” If a man live as a Christian and holy man, he “liveth\nby faith.” Nay, shall I say yet more, if he died as he ought, “he\ndieth by faith.” “These all died in faith.” What is that? The power\nof faith that directed and ordered them in the cause of their death,\nfurnished them with grounds and principles of assurance of the love of\nGod, made them carry themselves patiently in death. I can say no\nmore, but with the apostle, “Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the\nfaith.” Why doth not the apostle say, Examine whether faith be in you,\nbut “whether ye be in the faith”? His meaning is, that as a man is\nsaid to be in drink, or to be in love, or to be in passion, that is,\nunder the command of drink, or love, or passion; so the whole man must\nbe under the command of faith (as you shall see more afterward). If he\nprays, faith must indite his prayer; if he obey, faith must work; if\nhe live, it is faith that must quicken him; and if he die, it is faith\nthat must order him in death. And wheresoever faith is, it will do\nwonders in the soul of that man where it is; it can not be idle; it\nwill have footsteps, it sets the whole man on work; it moveth feet,\nand hands, and eyes, and all parts of the body. Mark how the apostle\ndisputeth: “We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is\nwritten, I believed, and therefore have I spoken, we also believe, and\ntherefore speak.” The faith of the apostle, which he had in his heart,\nset his tongue agoing. If a man have faith within, it will break forth\nat his mouth. This shall suffice for the proof of the point; I thought\nto have prest it further, but if I should, I see the time would\nprevent me.",
        "The use, therefore, in a word, is this: if this be so, then it falleth\nfoul, and is a heavy bill of indictment against many that live in the\nbosom of the Church. Go thy ways home, and read but this text, and\nconsider seriously but this one thing in it: That whosoever is the son\nof Abraham, hath faith, and whosoever hath faith is a walker, is a\nmarker; by the footsteps of faith you may see where faith hath been.\nWill not this, then, I say, fall marvelous heavy upon many souls that\nlive in the bosom of the Church, who are confident, and put it out of\nall question, that they are true believers, and make no doubt but what\nthey have faith? But look to it, wheresoever faith is, it is fruitful.\nIf thou art fruitless, say what thou wilt, thou hast no faith at all.\nAlas, these idle drones, these idle Christians, the Church is too full\nof them; Men are continually hearing, and yet remain fruitless and\nunprofitable; whereas if there were more faith in the world, we should\nhave more work done in the world; faith would set feet, and hands, and\neyes, and all on work. Men go under the name of professors, but alas!\nthey are but pictures; they stir not a whit; mark, where you found\nthem in the beginning of the year, there you shall find them in\nthe end of the year, as profane, as worldly, as loose in their\nconversations, as formal in duty as ever. And is this faith? Oh! faith\nwould work other matters, and provoke a soul to other passages than\nthese.",
        "But you will say, may not a man have faith, and not that fruit you\nspeak of? May not a man have a good heart to Godward, altho he can not\nfind that ability in matter of fruitfulness?",
        "My brethren, be not deceived; such an opinion is a mere delusion of\nSatan; wherever faith is it bringeth Christ into the soul; mark that,\n\"Whosoever believeth, Christ dwelleth in his heart by faith. And if\nChrist be in you,” saith the apostle, “the body is dead, because of\nsin, but the spirit is life, because of righteousness.” If Christ be\nin you, that is, whosoever believeth in the Lord Jesus, Christ dwells\nin such a man by faith; now if Christ be in the soul, the body can not\nbe dead; but a man is alive, and quick, and active to holy duties,\nready, and willing, and cheerful in the performance of whatsoever God\nrequireth. Christ is not a dear Savior, nor the Spirit a dead Spirit:\nthe second Adam is made a quickening spirit. And wherever the Spirit\nis, it works effects suitable to itself. The Spirit is a spirit of\npurity, a spirit of zeal, and where it is it maketh pure and zealous.\nWhen a man will say he hath faith, and in the mean time can be content\nto be idle and unfruitful in the work of the Lord, can be content\nto be a dead Christian, let him know that his case is marvelously\nfearful: for if faith were in him indeed it would appear; ye can not\nkeep your good hearts to yourselves; wherever fire is it will burn,\nand wherever faith is it can not be kept secret. The heart will be\nenlarged, the soul quickened, and there will be a change in the whole\nlife and conversation, if ever faith takes place in a man. I will say\nno more of this, but proceed to the second point arising out of the\naffirmative part.",
        "You will say, what fruit is it then? Or how shall a man know what\nis the true fruit of faith, indeed, whereby he may discern his own\nestate? I answer, the text will tell you: “He that walketh in the\nfootsteps of that faith of Abraham.” By footsteps are meant the works\nthe actions, the holy endeavors of Abraham; and where those footsteps\nare there is the faith of Abraham. So that the point of instruction\nhence is thus much (which indeed is the main drift of the apostle).",
        "That, Every faithful man may, yea doth, imitate the actions of\nfaithful Abraham.",
        "Mark what I say; I say again, this is to be the son of Abraham, not\nbecause we are begotten of him by natural generation, for so the Jews\nare the sons of Abraham; but Abraham is our father because he is the\npattern, for the proceeding of our faith. “Thy father was an Amorite,\"\nsaith the Scripture: that is, thou followest the steps of the\nAmorites in thy conversation. So is Abraham called the “father of the\nfaithful,” because he is the copy of their course, whom they must\nfollow in those services that God calleth for. So the point is clear,\nevery faithful man may, yea doth, and must imitate the actions of\nfaithful Abraham. It is Christ’s own plea, and He presseth it as an\nundeniable truth upon the hearts of the Scribes and Pharisees, that\nbragged very highly of their privileges and prerogatives, and said,\n\"Abraham is our father.” “No (saith Christ), if ye were Abraham’s\nchildren ye would do the works of Abraham.” To be like Abraham in\nconstitution, to be one of his blood, is not that which makes a man a\nson of Abraham, but to be like him in holiness of affection, to have\na heart framed and a life disposed answerably to his. The apostle in\nlike manner presseth this point when he would provoke the Hebrews,\nto whom he wrote, to follow the examples of the saints: “Whose faith\n(says he) follow, considering the end of their conversation.” So the\napostle Peter presseth the example of Sarah upon all good women:\n\"Whose daughter ye are (saith he) as long: as ye do well.”",
        "For the opening of the point, and that ye may more clearly understand\nit, a question here would be resolved, what were “the footsteps of\nthe faith of Abraham”? which way went he? This is a question, I say,\nworthy the scanning, and therefore (leaving the further confirmation\nof the point, as already evident enough) I will come to it that you\nmay know what to settle your hearts upon.",
        "I answer, therefore, there are six footsteps of the faith of Abraham,\nwhich are the main things wherein every faithful man must do as\nAbraham did, in the work of faith–I mean in his ordinary course; for\nif there be any thing extraordinary no man is bound to imitate him\ntherein; but in the works of faith, I say, which belongeth to all men,\nevery man must imitate Abraham in these six steps, and then he is\nin the next door to happiness, the very next neighbor, as I say, to\nheaven.",
        "The first advance which Abraham made in the ways of grace and\nhappiness, you shall observe to be a yielding to the call of God. Mark\nwhat God said to Abraham: “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy\nkindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will show\nthee; and Abraham departed,” saith the text, “as the Lord had spoken\nunto him.” Even when he was an idolater, he is content to lay aside\nall and let the command of God bear the sway; neither friends, nor\nkindred, nor gods can keep him back, but he presently stoopeth to the\ncall of God. So it is, my brethren, with every faithful man. This is\nhis first step: he is content to be under the rule and power of God’s\ncommand. Let the Lord call for him, require any service of him, his\nsoul presently yieldeth, and is content to be framed and fashioned to\nGod’s call, and returneth an obedient answer thereto; he is content\nto come out of his sins, and out of himself, and to receive the\nimpressions of the Spirit. This is that which God requireth, not only\nof Abraham, but of all believers: “Whosoever will be my disciple,\"\nsaith Christ, “must forsake father, and mother, and children, and\nhouses, and lands\"; yea, and he must “deny himself, and take up his\ncross and follow me.” This is the first step in Christianity, to lay\ndown our own honors, to trample upon our own respects, to submit our\nnecks to the block, as it were, and whatever God commands, to be\ncontent that His good pleasure should take place with us.",
        "Then Abraham, as doth every faithful soul, set forward, in this wise:\nHe showed that whenever faith cometh powerfully into the heart, the\nsoul is not content barely to yield to the command of God, but it\nbreatheth after His mercy, longeth for His grace, prizeth Christ and\nsalvation above all things in the world, is satisfied and contented\nwith nothing but with the Lord Christ, and altho it partake of many\nthings below, and enjoy abundance of outward comforts, yet it is not\nquieted till it rest and pitch itself upon the Lord, and find and feel\nthat evidence and assurance of His love, which He hath promised unto\nand will bestow on those who love Him. As for all things here below,\nhe hath but a slight, and mean, and base esteem of them. This you\nshall see apparent in Abraham. “Fear not, Abraham (saith God), I am\nthy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.” What could a man desire\nmore? One would think that the Lord makes a, promise here large enough\nto Abraham, “I will be thy buckler, and exceeding great reward.” Is\nnot Abraham contented with this? No; mark how he pleadeth with God:\n\"Lord God (saith he), what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless?\"\nHis eye is upon the promise that God had made to him of a son, of whom\nthe Savior of the world should come. “O Lord, what wilt thou give me?\"\nas if he had said, What wilt Thou do for me? alas! nothing will do my\nsoul good unless I have a son, and in him a Savior. What will become\nof me so long as I go childless, and so Saviorless, as I may so speak?\nYou see how Abraham’s mouth was out of taste with all other things,\nhow he could relish nothing, enjoy nothing in comparison of the\npromise, tho he had otherwise what he would, or could desire. Thus\nmust it be with every faithful man. That soul never had, nor never\nshall have Christ, that doth not prize Him above all things in the\nworld.",
        "The next step of Abraham’s faith was this, he casteth himself and\nflingeth his soul, as I may say, upon the all-sufficient power and\nmercy of God for the attainment of what he desireth; he rolleth and\ntumbleth himself, as it were, upon the all-sufficiency of God. This\nyou shall find in Rom. iv. 18, where the apostle, speaks of Abraham,\nwho “against hope, believed in hope\"; that is, when there was no hope\nin the world, yet he believed in God, even above hope, and so made it\npossible. It was an object of his hope, that it might be in regard of\nGod, howsoever there was no possibility in regard of man. So the text\nsaith, “he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about a\nhundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb, but was\nstrong in faith.” He cast himself wholly upon the precious promise and\nmercy of God.",
        "But he took another step in true justifying faith. He proved to us the\nbeliever is informed touching the excellency of the Lord Jesus,\nand that fulness that is to be had in Him, tho he can not find the\nsweetness of His mercy, tho he can not or dare not apprehend and\napply it to himself, tho he find nothing in himself, yet he is still\nresolved to rest upon the Lord, and to stay himself on the God of his\nsalvation, and to wait for His mercy till he find Him gracious to his\npoor soul. Excellent and famous is the example of the woman of Canaan.\nWhen Christ, as it were, beat her off, and took up arms against her,\nwas not pleased to reveal Himself graciously to her for the present,\n\"I am not sent (saith He) but to the lost sheep of the house of\nIsrael; and it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast\nit to the dogs\"; mark how she replied, “Truth, Lord, I confess\nall that; yet notwithstanding, the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall\nfrom their master’s table.” Oh, the excellency, and strength, and\nwork of her faith! She comes to Christ for mercy, He repelleth her,\nreproacheth her, tells her she is a dog; she confesseth her baseness,\nis not discouraged for all that, but still resteth upon the goodness\nand mercy of Christ, and is mightily resolved to have mercy whatsoever\nbefalleth her. Truth, Lord, I confess I am as bad as Thou canst term\nme, yet I confess, too, that there is no comfort but from Thee, and\ntho I am a dog, yet I would have crumbs. Still she laboreth to catch\nafter mercy, and to lean and to bear herself upon the favor of Christ\nfor the bestowing thereof upon her. So it must be with every faithful\nChristian in this particular; he must roll himself upon the power, and\nfaithfulness, and truth of God, and wait for His mercy (I will join\nthem both together for brevity’s sake, tho the latter be a fourth step\nand degree of faith); I say he must not only depend upon God, but he\nmust wait upon the Holy One of Israel.",
        "But a further step of Abraham’s faith appeared in this: he counted\nnothing too dear for the Lord; he was content to break through all\nimpediments, to pass through all difficulties, whatsoever God would\nhave, He had of him. This is the next step that Abraham went; and this\nyou shall find when God put him upon trial. The text saith there “that\nGod did tempt Abraham,” did try what He would do for Him, and He bade\nhim, “Go, take thy son, thine only son, Isaac, whom thou lovest, and\nslay him\"; and straight Abraham went and laid his son upon an altar,\nand took a knife, to cut the throat of his son–so that Abraham did\nnot spare his son Isaac, he did not spare for any cost, he did not\ndodge with God in this case; if God would have anything, He should\nhave it, whatsoever it were, tho it were his own life, for no question\nIsaac was dearer to him than his own life. And this was not his case\nalone, but the faithful people of God have ever walked the same\ncourse. The apostle Paul was of the same spirit; “I know not (saith\nhe) the things that shall befall me, save that the Holy Ghost\nwitnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me:\nbut none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto\nmyself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry\nwhich I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the\ngrace of God.” O blest spirit! here is the work of faith. Alas! when\nwe come to part with anything for the cause of God, how hardly comes\nit from us! “But I (saith he) pass not, no, nor is my life dear unto\nme.” Here, I say, is the work of faith, indeed, when a man is content\nto do anything for God, and to say if imprisonment, loss of estate,\nliberty, life, come, I pass not, it moveth me nothing, so I may finish\nmy course with comfort. Hence it was that the saints of God in those\nprimitive times “took joyfully the spoiling of their goods.” Methinks\nI see the saints there reaching after Christ with the arms of faith,\nand how, when anything lay in their way, they were content to lose\nall, to part with all, to have Christ. Therefore saith Saint Paul, “I\nam ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the\nname of the Lord Jesus.” Mark, rather than he would leave his Savior,\nhe would leave his life, and tho men would have hindered him, yet was\nresolved to have Christ, howsoever, tho he lost his life for Him. Oh,\nlet me have my Savior, and take my life!",
        "The last step of all is this: when the soul is thus resolved not to\ndodge with God, but to part with anything for Him, then in the last\nplace there followeth a readiness of heart to address man’s self to\nthe performance of whatsoever duty God requireth at his hands; I say\nthis is the last step, when, without consulting with flesh and blood,\nwithout hammering upon it, as it were, without awkwardness of heart,\nthere followeth a readiness to obey God; the soul is at hand. When\nAbraham was called, “Behold (saith he) here I am.” And so Samuel,\n\"Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth,” and so Ananias. “Behold, I am\nhere, Lord.” The faithful soul is not to seek, as an evil servant that\nis gone a roving after his companions, that is out of the way when his\nmaster would use him, but is like a trusty servant that waiteth upon\nhis master, and is ever at hand to do His pleasure. So you shall see\nit was with Abraham, when the Lord commanded him to go out of his\ncountry, “he obeyed, and went out, not knowing whither he went\"; he\nwent cheerfully and readily, tho he knew not whither; as who would\nsay, if the Lord calls, I will not question, if He command I will\nperform, whatever it be. So it must be with every faithful soul–we\nmust blind the eye of carnal reason, resolve to obey, tho heaven and\nearth seem to meet together in a contradiction, care not what man or\nwhat devil saith in this case, but what God will have done, do it;\nthis is the courage and obedience of faith. See how Saint Paul, in the\nplace before named, flung his ancient friends from him, when they came\nto cross him in the work of his ministry. They all came about him, and\nbecause they thought they should see his face no more, they besought\nhim not to go up to Jerusalem. Then Paul answered, “What, mean ye to\nweep, and to break my heart?” as who should say, It is a grief and a\nvexation to my soul, that ye would burden me, that I can not go with\nreadiness to perform the service that God requireth at my hands. The\nlike Christian courage was in Luther when his friends dissuaded him to\ngo to Worms: “If all the tiles in ’Worms’ were so many devils (said he)\nyet would I go thither in the name of my Lord Jesus.” This is the last\nstep.",
        "Now gather up a little what I have delivered. He that is resolved to\nstoop to the call of God; to prize the promises, and breathe after\nthem; to rest upon the Lord, and to wait His time for bestowing mercy\nupon him; to break through all impediments and difficulties, and to\ncount nothing too dear for God; to be content to perform ready and\ncheerful obedience; he that walketh thus, and treadeth in these steps,\npeace be upon him; heaven is hard by; he is as sure of salvation as\nthe angels are; it is as certain as the Lord liveth that he shall be\nsaved with faithful Abraham, for he walketh in the steps of Abraham,\nand therefore he is sure to be where he is. The case, you see, is\nclear, and the point evident, that every faithful man may, and must,\nimitate faithful Abraham.",
        "It may be here imagined, that we draw men up to too high a pitch; and\ncertainly, if this be the sense of the words, and the meaning of the\nHoly Ghost in this place, what will become of many that live in the\nbosom of the Church? Will you therefore see the point confirmed by\nreason? The ground of this doctrine stands thus: every faithful man\nhath the same faith, for nature and for work, that Abraham had;\ntherefore, look what nature his faith was of, and what power it had;\nof the same nature and power every true believer’s faith is. Briefly\nthus: the promises of God are the ground upon which all true faith\nresteth; the Spirit of God it is that worketh this faith in all\nbelievers; the power of the Spirit is that that putteth forth itself\nin the hearts and lives of all the faithful; gather these together:\nif all true believers have the same promises for the ground of their\nfaith; have one and the same spirit to work it; have’ one and the same\npower to draw out the abilities of faith, then certainly they can not\nbut have the very self-same actions, having the very self-same ground\nof their actions.",
        "Every particular believer (as the apostle Peter saith) “hath obtained\nthe like precious faith.” Mark, that there is a great deal of copper\nfaith in the world–much counterfeit believing; but the saints do\nall partake of “the like precious faith.” As when a man hath but a\nsixpence in silver, or a crown in gold, those small pieces, for the\nnature, are as good as the greatest of the same metal; so it is with\nthe faith of God’s elect. And look as it is in grafting; if there be\nmany scions of the same kind grafted into one stock, they all partake\nalike of the virtue of the stock; just so it is here. The Lord Jesus\nChrist is the stock, as it were, into which all the faithful are\ngrafted by the spirit of God and faith; therefore, whatsoever fruit\none beareth, another beareth also: howsoever, there may be degrees of\nworks, yet they are of the same nature. As a little apple is the same\nin taste with a great one of the same tree, even so every faithful man\nhath the same holiness of heart and life, because he hath the same\nprinciple of holiness. The fruit indeed that one Christian bringeth\nmay be but poor and small in comparison with others, yet it is the\nsame in kind; the course of his life is not with so much power and\nfulness of grace, it may be, as another’s, yet there is the same true\ngrace, and the same practise, in the kind of it, for truth, however in\ndegree it differ.",
        "Let us now come to see what benefit we may make to ourselves of this\npoint, thus proved and confirmed; and, certainly, the use of this\ndoctrine is of great consequence. In the first place, it is a just\nground of examination. For if it be true (as can not be denied, the\nreasons being so strong, and arguments so plain) that every son of\nAbraham followeth the steps of Abraham, then here you may clearly\nperceive who it is that hath saving faith indeed, who they be that are\ntrue saints and the sons of Abraham. By the light of this truth, by\nthe rule of this doctrine, if you would square your courses, and look\ninto your conversations, you can not but discern whether you have\nfaith or no. That man whose faith showeth itself and putteth itself\nforth in its several conditions, agreeably to, the faith of Abraham,\nthat man that followeth the footsteps of the faith of Abraham, let him\nbe esteemed a faithful man, let him be reckoned for a true believer.",
        "You that are gentlemen and tradesmen, I appeal to your souls whether\nthe Lord and His cause is not the loser this way? Doth not prayer pay\nfor it? Doth not the Word pay for it? Are not the ordinances always\nlosers when anything of your own cometh in competition? Is it not\nevident, then, that you are not under the command of the Word? How do\nyou tremble at the wrath and threatenings of a mortal man? and yet,\nwhen you hear the Lord thunder judgments out of His Word, who is\nhumbled? When He calls for fasting, and weeping, and mourning, who\nregards it? Abraham, my brethren, did not thus: these were none of his\nsteps; no, no: he went a hundred miles off this course. The Lord no\nsooner said to him, “Forsake thy country and thy kindred, and thy\nfather’s house,” but he forsook all, neither friend nor father\nprevailed to detain him from obedience, but he stooped willingly to\nGod’s command.",
        "There are a sort that come short of being the sons of Abraham, and\nthey are the close-hearted hypocrites. These are a generation that are\nof a more refined kind than the last, but howsoever they carry the\nmatter very covertly, yea, and are exceeding cunning; yet the truth\nwill make them known. Many a hypocrite may come thus far, to be\ncontent to part with anything, and outwardly to suffer for the cause\nof God, to part with divers pleasures and lusts, and to perform many\nholy services. But here is the difference between Abraham and these\nmen: Abraham forsook his goods and all, but your close-hearted\nhypocrites have always some god or other that they do homage to–their\nease, or their wealth, or some secret lust, something or other they\nhave set up as an idol within them–and so long as they may have and\nenjoy that, they will part with anything else. But thou must know\nthat, if thou be one of Abraham’s children, thou must come away from\nthy gods–the god of pride, of self-love, of vainglory–and leave\nworshiping of these, and be content to be alone by God and His truth.\nThis shall suffice for the first use; I can not proceed further in the\npressing thereof, because I would shut up all with the time.",
        "The second use is a word of instruction, and it shall be but a word or\ntwo; that if all the saints of God must walk in the same way of life\nand salvation that Abraham did, then there is no byway to bring a man\nto happiness. Look, what way Abraham went, you must go; there are no\nmore ways: the same course that he took must be a copy for you to\nfollow, a rule, as it were, for you to square your whole conversation\nby. There is no way but one to come to life and happiness. I speak it\nthe rather to dash that idle device of many carnal men, that think the\nLord hath a new invention to bring them to life, and that they need\nnot go the ordinary way, but God hath made a shorter cut for them.\nGreat men and gentlemen think God will spare them. What, must they be\nhumbled, and fast, and pray! That is for poor men, and mean men. Their\nplaces and estates will not suffer it; therefore surely God hath\ngiven a dispensation to them. And the poor men, they think it is for\ngentlemen that have more leisure and time: alas! they live by their\nlabor, and they must take pains for what they have, and therefore they\ncan not do what is required. But be not deceived; if there be any way\nbeside that which Abraham went, then will I deny myself. But the case\nis clear, the Lord saith it, the Word saith it; the same way, the same\nfootsteps that Abraham took, we must take, if ever we will come where\nAbraham is.",
        "You must not balk in this kind, whoever you are; God respecteth no\nman’s person. If you would arrive at the same haven, you must sail\nthrough the same sea. You must walk the same way of grace, if you\nwould come to the same kingdom of glory. It is a conceit that\nharboreth in the hearts of many men, nay, of most men in general,\nespecially your great wise men and your great rich men, that have\nbetter places and estates in the world than ordinary. What, think\nthey, may not a man be saved without all this ado? What needs all\nthis? Is there not another way besides this? Surely, my brethren, you\nmust teach our Savior Christ and the apostle Paul another way. I am\nsure they never knew another; and he that dreameth of another way must\nbe content to go beside. There is no such matter as the devil would\npersuade you; it is but his delusion to keep you under infidelity, and\nso shut you up to destruction under false and vain conceits. The truth\nis, here is the way, and the only way, and you must walk here if ever\nyou come to life and happiness. Therefore, be not deceived, suffer not\nyour eyes to be blinded; but know, what Abraham did, you must do the\nsame, if not in action, yet in affection. If God say, forsake all,\nthou must do it, at least in affection. Thou must still wait upon His\npower and providence; yield obedience to Him in all things; be content\nto submit thyself to His will. This is the way you must walk in, if\nyou ever come to heaven.",
        "The last use shall be a use of comfort to all the saints and people of\nGod, whose consciences can witness that they have labored to walk in\nthe uprightness of their heart as Abraham did. I have two or three\nwords to speak to these.",
        "Be persuaded out of the Word of God, that your course is good, and go\non with comfort, and the God of heaven be with you; and be sure of it,\nthat you that walk with Abraham shall be at rest with Abraham; and it\nshall never repent you of all the pains that you have taken. Haply it\nmay seem painful and tedious to you; yet, what Abigail said to David,\nlet me say to you: “Oh,” saith she, “let not my lord do this: when the\nLord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he\nhath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over\nIsrael, this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offense of heart, that\nthou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged\nhimself.” My brethren, let me say to you, you will find trouble and\ninconveniences and hard measure at the hands of the wicked in this\nworld. Many Nabals and Cains will set themselves against you; but go\non, and bear it patiently. Know it is a troublesome way, but a true\nway; it is grievous but yet good; and the end will be happy. It will\nnever repent you, when the Lord hath performed all the good that He\nhath spoken concerning you.",
        "Oh! to see a man drawing his breath low and short, after he hath\nspent many hours and days in prayer to the Lord, grappling with his\ncorruptions, and striving to pull down his base lusts, after he hath\nwaited upon the Lord in a constant course of obedience. Take but such\na man, and ask him, now his conscience is opened, whether the ways\nof holiness and sincerity be not irksome to him, whether he be not\ngrieved with himself for undergoing so much needless trouble (as the\nworld thinks it); and his soul will then clear this matter. It is true\nhe hath a tedious course of it, but now his death will be blest. He\nhath striven for a crown, and now beholds a crown. Now he is beyond\nthe waves. All the contempts, and imprisonments, and outrages\nof wicked men are now too short to reach him. He is so far from\nrepenting, that he rejoiceth and triumpheth in reflecting back upon\nall the pains, and care, and labor of love, whereby he hath loved the\nLord Jesus, in submitting his heart unto Him.",
        "Take me another man, that hath lived here in pomp and jollity,\nhath had many livings, great preferments, much honor, abundance of\npleasure, yet hath been ever careless of God and of His Word, profane\nin his course, loose in his conversation, and ask him upon his\ndeathbed, how it standeth with him. Oh! woe the time, that ever he\nspent it as he hath done. Now the soul begins to hate the man, and\nthe very sight of him that hath been, the instrument with it in the\ncommitting of sin. Now nothing but gall and wormwood remaineth. Now\nthe sweetness of the adulterer’s lust is gone, and nothing but the\nsting of conscience remaineth. Now the covetous man must part with\nhis goods, and the gall of asps must stick behind. Now the soul sinks\nwithin, and the heart is overwhelmed with sorrow. Take but these two\nmen, I say, and judge by their ends, whether it will ever repent you\nthat you have done well, that you have walked in the steps of the\nfaith of Abraham.",
        "My brethren, howsoever you have had many miseries, yet the Lord hath\nmany mercies for you. God dealeth with His servants, as a father doth\nwith his son, after he hath sent him on a journey to do some business;\nand the weather falleth foul, and the way proveth dangerous, and many\na storm, and great difficulties are to be gone through. Oh, how the\nheart of that father pitieth his son! How doth he resolve to requite\nhim, if he ever live to come home again! What preparation doth he make\nto entertain, and welcome him; and how doth he study to do good unto\nhim! My brethren, so it is here; I beseech you, think of it, you that\nare the saints and people of God. You must find in your way many\ntroubles and griefs (and we ought to find them), but be not\ndiscouraged. The more misery, the greater mercy. God the Father seeth\nHis servants: and if they suffer and endure for a good conscience, as\nHis eye seeth them, so His soul pitieth them. His heart bleeds within\nHim for them; that is, He hath a tender compassion of them, and He\nsaith within Himself, Well, I will requite them if ever they come into\nMy kingdom; all their patience, and care, and conscience in walking My\nways, I will requite; and they shall receive a double reward from Me,\neven a crown of eternal glory. Think of these things that are not\nseen; they are eternal. The things that are seen are temporal, and\nthey will deceive us. Let our hearts be carried after the other, and\nrest in them forever!",

        "Jeremy Taylor, born in Cambridge, England, in 1613, was the son of a\nbarber. By his talents he obtained an entrance into Caius College,\nwhere his exceptional progress obtained for him admission to the\nministry in his twenty-first year, two years before the canonical age.\nHe was appointed in succession fellow of All Souls, Oxford, through\nthe influence of Laud, chaplain to the King, and rector of Uppingham.\nDuring the Commonwealth he was expelled from his living and opened a\nschool in Wales, employing his seclusion in writing his memorable work\n\"The Liberty of Prophesying.”",
        "At the Restoration, Charles II raised him to the bishopric of Down and\nConnor (1660), in which post he remained until his death in 1667. His\n\"_Ductor Dubitantium,” dedicated to Charles II, is a work of subtilty\nand ingenuity; his “Holy Living” and “Holy Dying” (1652), are unique\nmonuments of learning and devotion.

        "CHRIST’S ADVENT TO JUDGMENT",
        "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every\none may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath\ndone, whether it be good or bad.–II Cor., v., 10.",
        "If we consider the person of the Judge, we first perceive that He is\ninterested in the injury of the crimes He is to sentence: “They shall\nlook on Him whom they have pierced.” It was for thy sins that the\nJudge did suffer such unspeakable pains as were enough to reconcile\nall the world to God; the sum and spirit of which pains could not be\nbetter understood than by the consequence of His own words, “My\nGod, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” meaning, that He felt such\nhorrible, pure, unmingled sorrows, that, altho His human nature was\npersonally united to the Godhead, yet at that instant he felt no\ncomfortable emanations by sensible perception from the Divinity, but\nHe was so drenched in sorrow that the Godhead seemed to have forsaken\nHim. Beyond this, nothing can be added: but then, that thou hast for\nthy own particular made all this sin in vain and ineffective, that\nChrist thy Lord and Judge should be tormented for nothing, that thou\nwouldst not accept felicity and pardon when he purchased them at so\ndear a price, must needs be an infinite condemnation to such persons.\nHow shalt thou look upon Him that fainted and died for love of thee,\nand thou didst scorn His miraculous mercies? How shall we dare to\nbehold that holy face that brought salvation to us, and we turned away\nand fell in love with death, and kissed deformity and sins? And yet in\nthe beholding that face consists much of the glories of eternity. All\nthe pains and passions, the sorrows and the groans, the humility and\npoverty, the labors and watchings, the prayers and the sermons, the\nmiracles and the prophecies, the whip and the nails, the death and the\nburial, the shame and the smart, the cross and the grave of Jesus,\nshall be laid upon thy score, if thou hast refused the mercies and\ndesign of all their holy ends and purposes. And if we remember what a\ncalamity that was which broke the Jewish nation in pieces, when Christ\ncame to judge them for their murdering Him who was their King and the\nPrince of Life, and consider that this was but a dark image of the\nterrors of the day of judgment, we may then apprehend that there is\nsome strange unspeakable evil that attends them that are guilty of\nthis death, and of so much evil to their Lord. Now it is certain if\nthou wilt not be saved by His death, you are guilty of His death; if\nthou wilt not suffer Him to have thee, thou art guilty of destroying\nHim; and then let it be considered what is to be expected from that\nJudge before whom you stand as His murderer and betrayer. But this is\nbut half of this consideration.",
        "Christ may be crucified again, and upon a new account, put to an open\nshame. For after that Christ has done all this by the direct actions\nof His priestly office, of sacrificing himself for us, He hath also\ndone very many things for us which are also the fruits of His first\nlove and prosecutions of our redemption. I will not instance the\nstrange arts of mercy that our Lord uses to bring us to live holy\nlives; but I consider, that things are so ordered, and so great\na value set upon our souls since they are the images of God, and\nredeemed by the blood of the Holy Lamb, that the salvation of our\nsouls is reckoned as a part of Christ’s reward, a part of the\nglorification of His humanity. Every sinner that repents causes joy to\nChrist, and the joy is so great that it runs over and wets the fair\nbrows and beauteous looks of cherubim and seraphim, and all the angels\nhave a part of that banquet; then it is that our blest Lord feels the\nfruits of His holy death; the acceptation of His holy sacrifice, the\ngraciousness of His person, the return of His prayers. For all that\nChrist did or suffered, and all that He now does as a priest in\nheaven, is to glorify His Father by bringing souls to God. For this it\nwas that He was born and died, that He descended from heaven to earth,\nfrom life to death, from the cross to the grave; this was the purpose\nof His resurrection and ascension, of the end and design of all the\nmiracles and graces of God manifested to all the world by Him; and now\nwhat man is so vile, such a malicious fool, that will refuse to bring\njoy to his Lord by doing himself the greatest good in the world? They\nwho refuse to do this, are said to crucify the Lord of Life again,\nand put him to an open shame–that is, they, as much as in them lies,\nbring Christ from His glorious joys to the labors of His life and the\nshame of His death; they advance His enemies, and refuse to advance\nthe kingdom of their Lord; they put themselves in that state in which\nthey were when Christ came to die for them; and now that He is in a\nstate that He may rejoice over them (for He hath done all His share\ntowards it), every wicked man takes his head from the blessing, and\nrather chooses that the devils should rejoice in his destruction,\nthan that his Lord should triumph in his felicity. And now upon the\nsupposition of these premises, we may imagine that it will be an\ninfinite amazement to meet that Lord to be our Judge whose person we\nhave murdered, whose honor we have disparaged, whose purposes we have\ndestroyed, whose joys we have lessened, whose passion we have made\nineffectual, and whose love we have trampled under our profane and\nimpious feet.",
        "But there is yet a third part of this consideration. As it will be\ninquired at the day of judgment concerning the dishonors to the person\nof Christ, so also concerning the profession and institution of\nChrist, and concerning His poor members; for by these also we make sad\nreflections upon our Lord. Every man that lives wickedly disgraces\nthe religion and institution of Jesus, he discourages strangers from\nentering into it, he weakens the hands of them that are in already,\nand makes that the adversaries speak reproachfully of the name of\nChrist; but altho it is certain our Lord and Judge will deeply resent\nall these things, yet there is one thing which He takes more tenderly,\nand that is, the uncharitableness of men towards His poor. It shall\nthen be upbraided to them by the Judge, that Himself was hungry\nand they refused to give meat to Him that gave them His body and\nheart-blood to feed them and quench their thirst; that they denied a\nrobe to cover His nakedness, and yet He would have clothed their souls\nwith the robe of His righteousness, lest their souls should be found\nnaked on the day of the Lord’s visitation; and all this unkindness is\nnothing but that evil men were uncharitable to their brethren, they\nwould not feed the hungry, nor give drink to the thirsty nor clothe\nthe naked, nor relieve their brothers’ needs, nor forgive their\nfollies, nor cover their shame, nor turn their eyes from delighting in\ntheir affronts and evil accidents; this is it which our Lord will take\nso tenderly, that His brethren for whom He died, who sucked the paps\nof His mother, that fed on His body and are nourished with His blood,\nwhom He hath lodged in His heart and entertains in His bosom, the\npartners of His spirit and co-heirs of His inheritance, that these\nshould be denied relief and suffered to go away ashamed, and unpitied;\nthis our blest Lord will take so ill, that all those who are guilty of\nthis unkindness, have no reason to expect the favor of the Court.",
        "To this if we add the almightiness of the Judge, His infinite wisdom\nand knowledge of all causes, and all persons, and all circumstances,\nthat He is infinitely just, inflexibly angry, and impartial in His\nsentence, there can be nothing added either to the greatness or the\nrequisites of a terrible and an almighty Judge. For who can resist Him\nwho is almighty? Who can evade His scrutiny that knows all things?\nWho can hope for pity of Him that is inflexible? Who can think to be\nexempted when the Judge is righteous and impartial? But in all these\nannexes of the Great Judge, that which I shall now remark, is that\nindeed which hath terror in it, and that is, the severity of our Lord.\nFor then is the day of vengeance and recompenses, and no mercy at\nall shall be showed, but to them that are the sons of mercy; for the\nother, their portion is such as can be expected from these premises.",
        "If we remember the instances of God’s severity in this life, in the\ndays of mercy and repentance, in those days when judgment waits upon\nmercy, and receives laws by the rules and measures of pardon, and that\nfor all the rare streams of loving; kindness issuing out of paradise\nand refreshing all our fields with a moisture more fruitful than the\nfloods of Nilus, still there are mingled some storms and violences,\nsome fearful instances of the divine justice, we may more readily\nexpect it will be worse, infinitely worse, at that day, when judgment\nshall ride in triumph, and mercy shall be the accuser of the wicked.\nBut so we read, and are commanded to remember, because they are\nwritten for our example, that God destroyed at once five cities of the\nplain, and all the country, and Sodom and her sisters are set forth\nfor an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Fearful it\nwas when God destroyed at once twenty-three thousand for fornication,\nand an exterminating angel in one night killed one hundred and\neighty-five thousand of the Assyrians, and the first-born of all the\nfamilies of Egypt, and for the sin of David in numbering the people,\nthree score and ten thousand of the people died, and God sent ten\ntribes into captivity and eternal oblivion and indistinction from a\ncommon people for their idolatry. Did not God strike Korah and his\ncompany with fire from heaven? and the earth opened and swallowed up\nthe congregation of Abiram? And is not evil come upon all the world\nfor one sin of Adam? Did not the anger of God break the nation of\nthe Jews all in pieces with judgments so great, that no nation ever\nsuffered the like, because none ever sinned so? And at once it was\ndone, that God in anger destroyed all the world, and eight persons\nonly escaped the angry baptism of water, and yet this world is the\ntime of mercy; God hath opened here His magazines, and sent His Holy\nSon as the great channel and fountain of it, too: here He delights in\nmercy, and in judgment loves to remember it, and it triumphs over all\nHis works, and God contrives instruments and accidents, chances and\ndesigns, occasions and opportunities for mercy. If, therefore, now the\nanger of God makes such terrible eruptions upon the wicked people that\ndelight in sin, how great may we suppose that anger to be, how severe\nthat judgment, how terrible that vengeance, how intolerable those\ninflictions which God reserves for the full effusion of indignation on\nthe great day of vengeance!",
        "We may also guess at it by this: if God upon all single instances,\nand in the midst of our sins, before they are come to the full, and\nsometimes in the beginning of an evil habit, be so fierce in His\nanger, what can we imagine it to be in that day when the wicked are\nto drink the dregs of that horrid potion, and count over all the\nparticulars of their whole treasure of wrath? “This is the day of\nwrath, and God shall reveal, or bring forth, His righteous judgments.\"\nThe expression is taken from Deut. xxxii., 34: “Is not this laid up in\nstore with me, and sealed up among my treasures? I will restore it in\nthe day of vengeance, for the Lord shall judge His people, and repent\nHimself for His servants.” For so did the Lybian lion that was brought\nup under discipline, and taught to endure blows, and eat the meat\nof order and regular provision, and to suffer gentle usages and\nthe familiarities of societies; but once He brake out into His own\nwildness, and killed two Roman boys; but those that forage in the\nLybian mountains tread down and devour all that they meet or master;\nand when they have fasted two days, lay up an anger great as is their\nappetite, and bring certain death to all that can be overcome. God is\npleased to compare himself to a lion; and though in this life He hath\nconfined Himself with promises and gracious emanations of an infinite\ngoodness, and limits himself by conditions and covenants, and suffers\nHimself to be overcome by prayers, and Himself hath invented ways of\natonement and expiation; yet when He is provoked by our unhandsome and\nunworthy actions, He makes sudden breaches, and tears some of us in\npieces, and of others He breaks their bones or affrights their hopes\nand secular gaieties, and fills their house with mourning and cypress,\nand groans and death. But when this Lion of the tribe of Judah shall\nappear upon His own mountain, the mountain of the Lord, in His natural\ndress of majesty, and that justice shall have her chain and golden\nfetters taken off, then justice shall strike, and mercy shall hold her\nhands; she shall strike sore strokes, and pity shall not break the\nblow; and God shall account with us by minutes, and for words, and for\nthoughts, and then He shall be severe to mark what is done amiss;\nand that justice may reign entirely, God shall open the wicked man’s\ntreasure, and tell the sums, and weigh grains and scruples. Said Philo\nupon the place of Deuteronomy before quoted: As there are treasures of\ngood things, and God has crowns and scepters in store for His saints\nand servants, and coronets for martyrs, and rosaries for virgins, and\nvials full of prayers, and bottles full of tears, and a register of\nsighs and penitential groans, so God hath a treasure of wrath and\nfury, of scourges and scorpions, and then shall be produced the shame\nof lust, and the malice of envy, and the groans of the opprest, and\nthe persecutions of the saints, and the cares of covetousness, and\nthe troubles of ambition, and the insolencies of traitors, and the\nviolence of rebels, and the rage of anger, and the uneasiness of\nimpatience, and the restlessness of unlawful desires; and by this time\nthe monsters and diseases will be numerous and intolerable, when God’s\nheavy hand shall press the sanies and the intolerableness, the\nobliquity and the unreasonableness, the amazement and the disorder,\nthe smart and the sorrow, the guilt and the punishment, out from all\nour sins, and pour them into one chalice, and mingle them with an\ninfinite wrath, and make the wicked drink of all the vengeance, and\nforce it down their unwilling throats with the violence of devils and\naccurst spirits.",
        "We may guess at the severity of the Judge by the lesser strokes of\nthat judgment which He is pleased to send upon sinners in this world,\nto make them afraid of the horrible pains of doomsday–I mean the\ntorments of an unquiet conscience, the amazement and confusions\nof some sins and some persons. For I have sometimes seen persons\nsurprised in a base action, and taken in the circumstances of crafty\ntheft and secret injustices, before their excuse was ready. They\nhave changed their color, their speech hath faltered, their tongue\nstammered, their eyes did wander and fix nowhere, till shame made\nthem sink into their hollow eye-pits to retreat from the images and\ncircumstances of discovery; their wits are lost, their reason useless,\nthe whole order of their soul is decomposed, and they neither see, nor\nfeel, nor think, as they used to do, but they are broken into disorder\nby a stroke of damnation and a lesser stripe of hell; but then if you\ncome to observe a guilty and a base murderer, a condemned traitor,\nand see him harassed first by an evil conscience, and then pulled in\npieces by the hangman’s hooks, or broken upon sorrows and the wheel,\nwe may then guess (as well as we can in this life) what the pains\nof that day shall be to accurst souls. But those we shall consider\nafterward in their proper scene; now only we are to estimate the\nseverity of our Judge by the intolerableness of an evil conscience;\nif guilt will make a man despair–and despair will make a man mad,\nconfounded, and dissolved in all the regions of his senses and more\nnoble faculties, that he shall neither feel, nor hear, nor see\nanything but specters and illusions, devils and frightful dreams, and\nhear noises, and shriek fearfully, and look pale and distracted, like\na hopeless man from the horrors and confusions of a lost battle, upon\nwhich all his hopes did stand–then the wicked must at the day of\njudgment expect strange things and fearful, and such which now no\nlanguage can express, and then no patience can endure. Then only it\ncan truly be said that he is inflexible and inexorable. No prayers\nthen can move Him, no groans can cause Him to pity thee; therefore\npity thyself in time, that when the Judge comes thou mayest be one of\nthe sons of everlasting mercy, to whom pity belongs as part of thine\ninheritance, for all else shall without any remorse (except His own)\nbe condemned by the horrible sentence.",
        "That all may think themselves concerned in this consideration, let us\nremember that even the righteous and most innocent shall pass through\na severe trial. Many of the ancients explicated this severity by the\nfire of conflagration, which say they shall purify those souls at the\nday of judgment, which in this life have built upon the foundation\n(hay and stubble) works of folly and false opinions, states of\nimperfection. So St. Augustine’s doctrine was: “The great fire at\ndoomsday shall throw some into the portion of the left hand, and\nothers shall be purified and represented on the right.” And the\nsame is affirmed by Origen and Lactantius; and St. Hilary thus\nexpostulates: “Since we are to give account for every idle word, shall\nwe long for the day of judgment, wherein we must, every one of us,\npass that unwearied fire in which those grievous punishments for\nexpiating the soul from sins must be endured; for to such as have been\nbaptized with the Holy Ghost it remaineth that they be consummated\nwith the fire of judgment.” And St. Ambrose adds: “That if any be as\nPeter or as John, they are baptized with this fire, and he that is\npurged here had need to be purged there again. Let him also purify us,\nthat every one of us being burned with that flaming sword, not burned\nup or consumed, we may enter into Paradise, and give thanks unto the\nLord who hath brought us into a place of refreshment.” This opinion of\ntheirs is, in the main of it, very uncertain; relying upon the sense\nof some obscure place of Scripture is only apt to represent the\ngreat severity of the Judge at that day, and it hath in it this only\ncertainty, that even the most innocent person hath great need of\nmercy, and he that hath the greatest cause of confidence, altho he\nruns to no rocks to hide him, yet he runs to the protection of the\ncross, and hides himself under the shadow of the divine mercies: and\nhe that shall receive the absolution of the blest sentence shall\nalso suffer the terrors of the day, and the fearful circumstances of\nChrist’s coming. The effect of this consideration is this: That if the\nrighteous scarcely be saved, where shall the wicked and the sinner\nappear? And if St. Paul, whose conscience accused him not, yet durst\nnot be too confident, because he was not hereby justified, but might\nbe found faulty by the severer judgment of his Lord, how shall we\nappear, with all our crimes and evil habits round about us? If there\nbe need of much mercy to the servants and friends of the Judge, then\nHis enemies shall not be able to stand upright in judgment.",
        "Let us next consider the circumstances of our appearing and his\nsentence; and first I consider that men at the day of judgment that\nbelong not to the portion of life, shall have three sorts of accusers:\n1. Christ Himself, who is their judge; 2. Their own conscience, whom\nthey have injured and blotted with characters of death and foul\ndishonor; 3. The devil, their enemy, whom they served.",
        "Christ shall be their accuser, not only upon the stock of those direct\ninjuries (which I before reckoned) of crucifying the Lord of\nLife, once and again, etc., but upon the titles of contempt and\nunworthiness, of unkindness and ingratitude; and the accusation will\nbe nothing else but a plain representation of those artifices and\nassistances, those bonds and invitations, those constrainings and\nimportunities, which our dear Lord used to us to make it almost\nimpossible to lie in sin, and necessary to be saved. For it will, it\nmust needs be, a fearful exprobration of our unworthiness, when the\nJudge Himself shall bear witness against us that the wisdom of God\nHimself was strangely employed in bringing us safely to felicity. I\nshall draw a short scheme which, altho it must needs be infinitely\nshort, of what God hath done for us, yet it will be enough to shame\nus. God did not only give His Son for an example, and the Son gave\nHimself for a price for us, but both gave the Holy Spirit to assist\nus in mighty graces, for the verifications of faith, and the\nentertainments of hope, and the increase and perseverance of charity.\nGod gave to us a new nature, He put another principle into us, a third\npart of a perfective constitution; we have the spirit put into us, to\nbe a part of us, as properly to produce actions of a holy life, as the\nsoul of man in the body does produce the natural. God hath exalted\nhuman nature, and made it in the person of Jesus Christ, to sit above\nthe highest seat of angels, and the angels are made ministering\nspirits, ever since their Lord became our brother. Christ hath by a\nmiraculous sacrament given us His body to eat and His blood to drink;\nHe made ways that we may become all one with Him. He hath given us an\neasy religion, and hath established our future felicity upon natural\nand pleasant conditions, and we are to be happy hereafter if we suffer\nGod to make us happy here; and things are so ordered that a man must\ntake more pains to perish than to be happy. God hath found out rare\nways to make our prayers acceptable, our weak petitions, the desires\nof our imperfect souls, to prevail mightily with God, and to lay a\nholy violence and an undeniable necessity upon Himself; and God will\ndeny us nothing but when we ask of Him to do us ill offices, to give\nus poisons and dangers, and evil nourishment, and temptations; and He\nthat hath given such mighty power to the prayers of His servants, yet\nwill not be moved by those potent and mighty prayers to do any good\nman an evil turn, or to grant him one mischief–in that only God can\ndeny us. But in all things else God hath made all the excellent things\nin heaven and earth to join toward the holy and fortunate effects;\nfor He that appointed an angel to present the prayers of saints,\nand Christ makes intercession for us, and the Holy Spirit makes\nintercession for us with groans unutterable, and all the holy men in\nthe world pray for all and for every one, and God hath instructed us\nwith scriptures, and precedents, and collateral and direct assistances\nto pray, and He encouraged us with divers excellent promises, and\nparables, and examples, and teaches us what to pray, and how, and\ngives one promise to public prayer, and another to private prayer, and\nto both the blessing of being heard.",
        "Add to this account that God did heap blessings upon us without order,\ninfinitely, perpetually, and in all instances, when we needed and when\nwe needed not. He heard us when we prayed, giving us all, and giving\nus more, than we desired. He desired that we should ask, and yet He\nhath also prevented our desires. He watched for us, and at His own\ncharge sent a whole order of men whose employment is to minister to\nour souls; and if all this had not been enough, He had given us more\nalso. He promised heaven to our obedience, a province for a dish of\nwater, a kingdom for a prayer, satisfaction for desiring it, grace\nfor receiving, and more grace for accepting and using the first.\nHe invited us with gracious words and perfect entertainments; He\nthreatened horrible things to us if we would not be happy; He hath\nmade strange necessities for us, making our very repentance to be a\nconjugation of holy actions, and holy times, and a long succession;\nHe hath taken away all excuses from us; He hath called us from\ntemptation; He bears our charges; He is always beforehand with us in\nevery act of favor, and perpetually slow in striking, and His arrows\nare unfeathered; and He is so long, first, in drawing His sword, and\nanother long while in whetting it, and yet longer in lifting His hand\nto strike, that before the blow comes the man hath repented long,\nunless he be a fool and impudent; and then God is so glad of an excuse\nto lay His anger aside, that certainly, if after all this, we refuse\nlife and glory, there is no more to be said; this plain story will\ncondemn us; but the story is very much longer; and, as our conscience\nwill represent all our sins to us, so the Judge will represent all His\nFather’s kindnesses, as Nathan did to David, when he was to make the\njustice of the divine sentence appear against him. Then it shall\nbe remembered that the joys of every day’s piety would have been a\ngreater pleasure every night than the remembrance of every night’s sin\ncould have been in the morning; that every night the trouble and labor\nof the day’s virtue would have been as much passed and turned to as\nthe pleasure of that day’s sin, but that they would be infinitely\ndistinguished by the effects. The offering ourselves to God every\nmorning, and the thanksgiving to God every night, hope and fear, shame\nand desire, the honor of leaving a fair name behind us, and the shame\nof dying like a fool,–everything indeed in the world is made to be an\nargument and an inducement to us to invite us to come to God and be\nsaved; and therefore when this, and infinitely more shall by the Judge\nbe exhibited in sad remembrances, there needs no other sentence; we\nshall condemn ourselves with a hasty shame and a fearful confusion,\nto see how good God hath been to us, and how base we have been to\nourselves. Thus Moses is said to accuse the Jews; and thus also He\nthat does accuse, is said to condemn, as Verres was by Cicero, and\nClaudia by Domitius her accuser, and the world of impenitent persons\nby the men of Nineveh, and all by Christ, their Judge. I represent\nthe horror of this circumstance to consist in this, besides the\nreasonableness of the judgment, and the certainty of the condemnation,\nit can not but be an argument of an intolerable despair to perishing\nsouls, when He that was our advocate all our life, shall, in the day\nof that appearing, be our Accuser and our Judge, a party against us,\nan injured person in the day of His power and of His wrath, doing\nexecution upon all His own foolish and malicious enemies.",
        "Our conscience shall be our accuser. But this signifies but these two\nthings: First, That we shall be condemned for the evils that we have\ndone and shall then remember, God by His power wiping away the dust\nfrom the tables of our memory, and taking off the consideration and\nthe voluntary neglect and rude shufflings of our cases of conscience.\nFor then we shall see things as they are, the evil circumstances and\nthe crooked intentions, the adherent unhandsomeness and the direct\ncrimes; for all things are laid up safely, and tho we draw a curtain\nof cobweb over them, and a few fig-leaves before our shame, yet God\nshall draw away the curtain, and forgetfulness shall be no more,\nbecause, with a taper in the hand of God, all the corners of our\nnastiness shall be discovered. And, secondly, it signifies this also,\nthat not only the justice of God shall be confest by us in our own\nshame and condemnation, but the evil of the sentence shall be received\ninto us, to melt our bowels and to break our heart in pieces within\nus, because we are the authors of our own death, and our own inhuman\nhands have torn our souls in pieces. Thus far the horrors are great,\nand when evil men consider it, it is certain they must be afraid to\ndie. Even they that have lived well, have some sad considerations, and\nthe tremblings of humility, and suspicion of themselves. I remember\nSt. Cyprian tells of a good man who in his agony of death saw a\nfantasm of a noble and angelical shape, who, frowning and angry, said\nto him: “Ye can not endure sickness, ye are troubled at the evils of\nthe world, and yet you are loath to die and to be quit of them;\nwhat shall I do to you?” Altho this is apt to represent every man’s\ncondition more or less, yet, concerning persons of wicked lives,\nit hath in it too many sad degrees of truth; they are impatient of\nsorrow, and justly fearful of death, because they know not how to\ncomfort themselves in the evil accidents of their lives; and their\nconscience is too polluted to take death for sanctuary, and to hope\nto have amends made to their condition by the sentence of the day of\njudgment. Evil and sad is their condition who can not be contented\nhere nor blest hereafter, whose life is their misery and their\nconscience is their enemy, whose grave is their prison and death their\nundoing, and the sentence of doomsday the beginning of an intolerable\ncondition.",
        "The third sort of accusers are the devils, and they will do it with\nmalicious and evil purposes. The prince of the devils hath Diabolus\nfor one of his chiefest appellatives. The accuser of the brethren\nhe is by his profest malice and employment; and therefore God, who\ndelights that His mercy should triumph and His goodness prevail over\nall the malice of men and devils, hath appointed one whose office is\nto reprove the accuser and to resist the enemy, and to be a defender\nof their cause who belong to God. The Holy Spirit is a defender; the\nevil spirit is the accuser; and they that in this life belong to one\nor the other, shall in the same proportion be treated at the day of\njudgment. The devil shall accuse the brethren, that is, the saints\nand servants of God, and shall tell concerning their follies and\ninfirmities, the sins of their youth and weakness of their age, the\nimperfect grace and the long schedule of omissions of duty, their\nscruples and their fears, their diffidences and pusillanimity, and all\nthose things which themselves by strict examination find themselves\nguilty of and have confest all their shame and the matter of their\nsorrows, their evil intentions and their little plots, their carnal\nconfidences and too fond adherences of the things of this world, their\nindulgence and easiness of government, their wilder joys and freer\nmeals, their loss of time and their too forward and apt compliances,\ntheir trifling arrests and little peevishnesses, the mixtures of the\nworld with the thing of the Spirit, and all the incidences of\nhumanity he will bring forth and aggravate them by circumstances of\ningratitude, and the breach of promise, and the evacuating all their\nholy purposes, and breaking their resolutions, and rifling their vows,\nand all these things, being drawn into an entire representment, and\nthe bills clogged by numbers, will make the best man in the world seem\nfoul and unhandsome, and stained with the characters of death and evil\ndishonor. But for these there is appointed a defender. The Holy Spirit\nthat maketh intercession for us shall then also interpose, and against\nall these things shall oppose the passion of our blest Lord, and upon\nall their defects shall cast the robe of righteousness; and the sins\nof their youth shall not prevail so much as the repentance of their\nage, and their omissions be excused by probable intervening causes,\nand their little escapes shall appear single and in disunion, because\nthey were always kept asunder by penitential prayers and sighings, and\ntheir seldom returns of sin by their daily watchfulness, and their\noften infirmities by the sincerity of their souls, and their scruples\nby their zeal, and their passions by their love, and all by the\nmercies of God and the sacrifice which their Judge offered and the\nHoly Spirit made effective by daily graces and assistances. These,\ntherefore, infallibly go to the portion of the right hand, because the\nLord our God shall answer for them. But as for the wicked, it is not\nso with them; for altho the plain story of their life be to them a\nsad condemnation, yet what will be answered when it shall be told\nconcerning them, that they despised God’s mercies, and feared not His\nangry judgments; that they regarded not His Word, and loved not\nHis excellences; that they were not persuaded by the promises nor\naffrighted by His threatenings; that they neither would accept His\ngovernment nor His blessings; that all the sad stories that ever\nhappened in both the worlds (in all which Himself did escape till the\nday of His death, and was not concerned in them save only that He was\ncalled upon by every one of them, which He ever heard or saw or was\ntold of, to repentance), that all these were sent to Him in vain? But\ncan not the accuser truly say to the Judge concerning such persons,\n\"They were Thine by creation, but mine by their own choice; Thou didst\nredeem them indeed, but they sold themselves to me for a trifle, or\nfor an unsatisfying interest; Thou diedst for them, but they obeyed\nmy commandments; I gave them nothing, I promised them nothing but the\nfilthy pleasures of a night, or the joys of madness, or the delights\nof a disease; I never hanged upon the cross three long hours for them,\nnor endured the labors of a poor life thirty-three years together for\ntheir interest; only when they were Thine by the merit of Thy death,\nthey quickly became mine by the demerit of their ingratitude; and when\nThou hadst clothed their soul with Thy robe, and adorned them by Thy\ngraces, we stript them naked as their shame, and only put on a robe of\ndarkness, and they thought themselves secure and went dancing to\ntheir grave like a drunkard to a fight, or a fly unto a candle; and\ntherefore they that did partake with us in our faults must divide with\nus in our portion and fearful interest.” This is a sad story because\nit ends in death, and there is nothing to abate or lessen the\ncalamity. It concerns us therefore to consider in time that he that\ntempts us will accuse us, and what he calls pleasant now he shall then\nsay was nothing, and all the gains that now invite earthly souls and\nmean persons to vanity, was nothing but the seeds of folly, and the\nharvest in pain and sorrow and shame eternal. But then, since this\nhorror proceeds upon the account of so many accusers, God hath put it\nin our power by a timely accusation of ourselves in the tribunal of\nthe court Christian, to prevent all the arts of aggravation which at\ndoomsday shall load foolish and undiscerning souls. He that accuses\nhimself of his crimes here, means to forsake them, and looks upon them\non all sides, and spies out his deformity, and is taught to hate them,\nhe is instructed and prayed for, he prevents the anger of God and\ndefeats the devil’s malice, and, by making shame the instrument of\nrepentance, he takes away the sting, and makes that to be his medicine\nwhich otherwise would be his death: and, concerning this exercise, I\nshall only add what the patriarch of Alexandria told an old religious\nperson in his hermitage. Having asked him what he found in that\ndesert, he was answered, “Only this, to judge and condemn myself\nperpetually; that is the employment of my solitude.” The patriarch\nanswered, “There is no other way.” By accusing ourselves we shall make\nthe devil’s malice useless, and our own consciences clear, and be\nreconciled to the Judge by the severities of an early repentance, and\nthen we need to fear no accusers.",
        "MAKING LIGHT OF CHRIST AND SALVATION",
        "Richard Baxter, was born in 1615, at Rowton, near Shrewsbury, in\nEngland. After surmounting great difficulties in securing an education\nfor the ministry he was ordained in 1638, in the Church of England,\nhis first important charge being that of Kidderminster, where he\nestablished his reputation as a powerful evangelical and controversial\npreacher. Altho opposed to Cromwell’s extreme acts, he became a\nchaplain in the army of the Rebellion. His influence was all on the\nside of peace, however, and at the Restoration he was appointed\nchaplain to Charles II.",
        "Baxter left the Church of England on the promulgation of the Act of\nUniformity, and in 1662 retired to Acton in Middlesex, where he wrote\nmost of his works. The Acts of Indulgence enabled him to return to\nLondon, where he remained until Judge Jeffreys imprisoned and fined\nhim on a charge of sedition. He was the most prolific writer and\ncontroversialist of his day among nonconformists. Baxter left only two\nworks which seem likely to be of ever fresh interest, “The Saint’s\nRest” and “Calls to the Unconverted.” He died in London in 1691.",

        "MAKING LIGHT OF CHRIST AND SALVATION",
        "But they made light of it.–Matt, xxii., 5.",
        "Beloved hearers; the office that God hath called us to is, by\ndeclaring the glory of His grace, to help under Christ to the saving\nof men’s souls. I hope you think not that I come hither to-day on\nanother errand. The Lord knows I had not set a foot out-of-doors but\nin hope to succeed in this work for your souls. I have considered, and\noften considered, what is the matter that so many thousands should\nperish when God hath done so much for their salvation; and I find this\nthat is mentioned in my text is the cause. It is one of the wonders of\nthe world, that when God hath so loved the world as to send His Son,\nand Christ hath made a satisfaction by His death sufficient for them\nall, and offereth the benefits of it so freely to them, even without\nmoney or price, that yet the most of the world should perish; yea,\nthe most of those that are thus called by His Word! Why, here is the\nreason–when Christ hath done all this, men make light of it. God hath\nshowed that He is not unwilling; and Christ hath showed that He is not\nunwilling that men should be restored to God’s favor and be saved; but\nmen are actually unwilling themselves. God takes not pleasure in the\ndeath of sinners, but rather that they return and live. But men take\nsuch pleasure in sin that they will die before they will return. The\nLord Jesus was content to be their physician, and hath provided them a\nsufficient plaster of His own blood: but if men make light of it,\nand will not apply it, what wonder if they perish after all? This\nScripture giveth us the reason of their perdition. This, sad\nexperience tells us, the most of the world is guilty of. It is a most\nlamentable thing to see how most men do spend their care, their time,\ntheir pains, for known vanities, while God and glory are cast aside;\nthat He who is all should seem to them as nothing, and that which\nis nothing should seem to them as good as all; that God should set\nmankind in such a race where heaven or hell is their certain end, and\nthat they should sit down, and loiter, or run after the childish toys\nof the world, and so much forget the prize that they should run for.\nWere it but possible for one of us to see the whole of this business\nas the all-seeing God doth; to see at one view both heaven and hell,\nwhich men are so near; and see what most men in the world are minding,\nand what they are doing every day, it would be the saddest sight that\ncould be imagined. Oh, how should we marvel at their madness, and\nlament their self-delusion! O poor distracted world! what is it you\nrun after? and what is it that you neglect? If God had never told them\nwhat they were sent into the world to do, or whither they were\ngoing, or what was before them in another world, then they had been\nexcusable; but He hath told them over and over, till they were weary\nof it. Had He left it doubtful, there had been some excuse; but it is\nHis sealed word, and they profess to believe it, and would take it ill\nof us if we should question whether they do believe it or not.",
        "Beloved, I come not to accuse any of you particularly of this crime;\nbut seeing it is the commonest cause of men’s destruction, I suppose\nyou will judge it the fittest matter for our inquiry, and deserving\nour greatest care for the cure. To which end I shall, (1) endeavor the\nconviction of the guilty; (2) shall give them such considerations as\nmay tend to humble and reform them; (3) I shall conclude with such\ndirection as may help them that are willing to escape the destroying\npower of this sin.",
        "And for the first, consider: It is the case of most sinners to think\nthemselves freest from those sins that they are most enslaved to; and\none reason why we can not reform them is because we can not convince\nthem of their guilt. It is the nature of sin so far to blind and\nbefool the sinner, that he knoweth not what he doth, but thinketh he\nis free from it when it reigneth in him, or when he is committing it:\nit bringeth men to be so much unacquainted with themselves that they\nknow not what they think, or what they mean and intend, nor what they\nlove or hate, much less what they are habituated and disposed to.\nThey are alive to sin, and dead to all the reason, consideration,\nand resolution that should recover them, as if it were only by their\nsinning that we must know that they are alive. May I hope that you\nthat hear me to-day are but willing to know the truth of your case,\nand then I shall be encouraged to proceed to an inquiry. God will\njudge impartially; why should not we do so? Let me, therefore, by\nthese following questions, try whether none of you are slighters\nof Christ and your own salvation. And follow me, I beseech you, by\nputting them close to your own hearts, and faithfully answering them.",
        "Things that men highly value will be remembered; they will be matter\nof their freest and sweetest thoughts. This is a known case.",
        "Do not those then make light of Christ and salvation that think of\nthem so seldom and coldly in comparison of other things? Follow thy\nown heart, man, and observe what it daily runneth after; and then\njudge whether it make not light of Christ.",
        "We can not persuade men to one hour’s sober consideration what they\nshould do for an interest in Christ, or in thankfulness for His love,\nand yet they will not believe that they make light of Him.",
        "Things that we highly value will be matter of our discourse; the\njudgment and heart will command the tongue. Freely and delightfully\nwill our speech run after them. This also is a known case.",
        "Do not those men make light of Christ and salvation that shun the\nmention of His name, unless it be in a vain or sinful use? Those that\nlove not the company where Christ and salvation is much talked of, but\nthink it troublesome, precise discourse: that had rather hear some\nmerry jests, or idle tales, or talk of their riches or business in the\nworld; when you may follow them from morning to night, and scarce have\na savory word of Christ; but perhaps some slight and weary mention\nof Him sometimes; judge whether these make not light of Christ and\nsalvation. How seriously do they talk of the world and speak of\nvanity! but how heartlessly do they make mention of Christ and\nsalvation!",
        "The things that we highly value we would secure the possession of,\nand therefore would take any convenient course to have all doubts and\nfears about them well resolved. Do not those men then make light\nof Christ and salvation that have lived twenty or thirty years in\nuncertainty whether they have any part in these or not, and yet never\nseek out for the right resolution of their doubts? Are all that hear\nme this day certain they shall be saved? Oh, that they were! Oh, had\nyou not made light of salvation, you could not so easily bear such\ndoubting of it; you could not rest till you had made it sure, or done\nyour best to make it sure. Have you nobody to inquire of, that might\nhelp you in such a work? Why, you have ministers that are purposely\nappointed to that office. Have you gone to them, and told them the\ndoubtfulness of your case, and asked their help in the judging of your\ncondition? Alas! ministers may sit in their studies from one year to\nanother, before ten persons among a thousand will come to them on such\nan errand! Do not these make light of Christ and salvation? When the\ngospel pierceth the heart indeed, they cry out, “Men and brethren,\nwhat shall we do to be saved?” Trembling and astonished, Paul cries\nout, “Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?” And so did the convinced\nJews to Peter. But when hear we such questions?",
        "The things that we value do deeply affect us, and some motions will be\nin the heart according to our estimation of them. O sirs, if men made\nnot light of these things, what working would there be in the hearts\nof all our hearers! What strange affections would it raise in them to\nhear of the matters of the world to come! How would their hearts melt\nbefore the power of the gospel! What sorrow would be wrought in the\ndiscovery of their sins! What astonishment at the consideration of\ntheir misery! What unspeakable joy at the glad tidings of salvation by\nthe blood of Christ! What resolution would be raised in them upon the\ndiscovery of their duty! Oh, what hearers should we have, if it were\nnot for this sin! Whereas now we are liker to weary them, or preach\nthem asleep with matters of this unspeakable moment. We talk to them\nof Christ and salvation till we make their heads ache: little would\none think by their careless carriage that they heard and regarded what\nwe said, or tho we spoke at all to them.",
        "Our estimation of things will be seen in the diligence of our\nendeavors. That which we highliest value, we shall think no pains\ntoo great to obtain. Do not those men then make light of Christ and\nsalvation that think all too much that they do for them; that murmur\nat His service, and think it too grievous for them to endure? that ask\nHis service as Judas of the ointment. What need this waste? Can not\nmen be saved without so much ado? This is more ado than needs. For the\nworld they will labor all the day, and all their lives; but for Christ\nand salvation they are afraid of doing too much. Let us preach to them\nas long as we will, we can not bring them to relish or resolve upon a\nlife of holiness. Follow them to their houses, and you shall not hear\nthem read a chapter, nor call upon God with their families once a day;\nnor will they allow Him that one day in seven which He hath separated\nto His service. But pleasure, or worldly business, or idleness, must\nhave a part And many of them are so far hardened as to reproach them\nthat will not be as mad as themselves. And is not Christ worth the\nseeking? Is not everlasting salvation worth more than all this? Doth\nnot that soul make light of all these that thinks his ease more worth\nthan they? Let but common sense judge.",
        "That which we most highly value, we think we can not buy too dear.\nChrist and salvation are freely given, and yet the most of men go\nwithout them because they can not enjoy the world and them together.\nThey are called but to part with that which would hinder them Christ,\nand they will not do it. They are called but to give God His own, and\nto resign all to His will, and let go the profits and pleasures of\nthis world, when they must let go either Christ or them, and they will\nnot. They think this too dear a bargain, and say they can not spare\nthese things: they must hold their credit with men; they must look\nto their estates: how shall they live else? They must have their\npleasure, whatsoever becomes of Christ and salvation: as if they could\nlive without Christ better than without these; as if they were afraid\nof being losers by Christ, or could make a saving match by losing\ntheir souls to gain the world. Christ hath told us over and over that\nif we will not forsake all for Him we can not be His disciples. Far\nare these men from forsaking all, and yet will needs think that they\nare His disciples indeed.",
        "That which men highly esteem, they would help their friends to as well\nas themselves. Do not those men make light of Christ and salvation\nthat can take so much care to leave their children portions in the\nworld, and do so little to help them to heaven? that provide outward\nnecessaries so carefully for their families, but do so little to the\nsaving of their souls? Their neglected children and friends will\nwitness that either Christ, or their children’s souls, or both, were\nmade light of.",
        "That which men highly esteem, they will so diligently seek after that\nyou may see it in the success, if it be a matter within their reach.\nYou may see how many make light of Christ, by the little knowledge\nthey have of Him, and the little communion with Him, and the\ncommunication from Him; and the little, yea, none, of His special\ngrace in them. Alas! how many ministers can speak it to the sorrow of\ntheir hearts, that many of their people know almost nothing of Christ,\ntho they hear of Him daily! Nor know they what they must do to be\nsaved: if we ask them an account of these things, they answer as if\nthey understood not what we say to them, and tell us they are no\nscholars, and therefore think they are excusable for their ignorance.\nOh, if these men had not made light of Christ and their salvation, but\nhad bestowed but half as much pains to know and enjoy Him as they have\ndone to understand the matters of their trades and callings in the\nworld, they would not have been so ignorant as they are: they make\nlight of these things, and therefore will not be at the pains to study\nor learn them. When men that can learn the hardest trade in a few\nyears have not learned a catechism, nor how to understand their\ncreed, under twenty or thirty years’ preaching, nor can abide to\nbe questioned about such things, doth not this show that they have\nslighted them in their hearts? How will these despisers of Christ and\nsalvation be able one day to look Him in the face, and to give an\naccount of these neglects?",
        "Thus much I have spoken in order to your conviction. Do not some of\nyour consciences by this time smite you, and say, I am the man that\nhave made light of my salvation? If they do not, it is because you\nmake light of it still, for all that is said to you. But because, if\nit be the will of the Lord, I would fain have this damning distemper\ncured, and am loath to leave you in such a desperate condition, if I\nknew how to remedy it, I will give you some considerations, which may\nmove you, if you be men of reason and understanding, to look better\nabout you; and I beseech you to weigh them, and make use of them as we\ngo, and lay open your hearts to the work of grace, and sadly bethink\nyou what a case you are in, if you prove such as make light of Christ.",
        "Consider, 1. Thou makest light of Him that made not light of thee who\ndeserve it. Thou wast worthy of nothing but contempt. As a man, what\nart thou but a worm to God? As a sinner, thou art far viler than\na toad: yet Christ was so far from making light of thee and thy\nhappiness, that He came down into the flesh, and lived a life of\nsuffering, and offered Himself a sacrifice to the justice which thou\nhadst provoked, that thy miserable soul might have a remedy. It is no\nless than miracles of love and mercy that He hath showed to us; and\nyet shall we slight them after all?",
        "Angels admire them, whom they less concern, and shall redeemed sinners\nmake light of them? What barbarous, yea, devilish–yea, worse than\ndevilish–ingratitude is this! The devils never had a savior offered\nto them; but thou hast, and dost thou yet make light of Him?",
        "2. Consider, the work of man’s salvation by Jesus Christ is the\nmasterpiece of all the works of God, wherein He would have His love\nand mercy to be magnified. As the creation declareth. His goodness and\npower, so doth redemption His goodness and mercy; He hath contrived\nthe very frame of His worship so that it shall much consist in the\nmagnifying of this work; and, after all this, will you make light of\nit? “His name is wonderful.” “He did the work that none could do.\"\n\"Greater love could none show than His.” How great was the evil and\nmisery that He delivered us from! the good procured from us! All are\nwonders, from His birth to His ascension; from our new birth to our\nglorification, all are wonders of matchless mercy–and yet do you make\nlight of them?",
        "3. You make light of matters of greatest excellency and moment in the\nworld: you know not what it is that you slight: had you well known,\nyou would not have done it. As Christ said to the woman of Samaria,\n\"Hadst thou known who it is that speaketh to thee, thou wouldst have\nasked of Him the waters of life\"; had they known they would not have\ncrucified the Lord of Glory. So, had you known what Christ is, you\nwould not have made light of Him; had you been one day in heaven, and\nbut seen what they possess, and seen also what miserable souls must\nendure that are shut out, you would never sure have made so light of\nChrist.",
        "O sirs, it is no trifles or jesting matters that the gospel speaks of.\nI must needs profess to you that when I have the most serious thoughts\nof these things myself, I am ready to marvel that such amazing matters\ndo not overwhelm the souls of men; that the greatness of the subject\ndoth not so overmatch our understandings and affections as even to\ndrive men besides themselves, but that God hath always somewhat\nallayed it by the distance; much more that men should be so blockish\nas to make light of them. O Lord, that men did but know what\neverlasting glory and everlasting torments are: would they then hear\nus as they do? would they read and think of these things as they do?\nI profess I have been ready to wonder, when I have heard such\nweighty things delivered, how people can forbear crying out in the\ncongregation; much more how they can rest till they have gone to their\nministers, and learned what they should do to be saved, that this\ngreat business might be put out of doubt. Oh, that heaven and hell\nshould work no more on men! Oh, that everlastingness work no more! Oh,\nhow can you forbear when you are alone to think with yourselves what\nit is to be everlastingly in joy or in torment! I wonder that such\nthoughts do not break your sleep, and that they come not in your mind\nwhen you are about your labor! I wonder how you can almost do anything\nelse! how you can have any quietness in your minds! How you can eat,\nor drink, or rest, till you have got some ground of everlasting\nconsolations! Is that a man or a corpse that is not affected with\nmatters of this moment? that can be readier to sleep than to tremble\nwhen he heareth how he must stand at the bar of God? Is that a man or\na clod of clay that can rise or lie down without being deeply affected\nwith his everlasting estate? that can follow his worldly business and\nmake nothing of the great business of salvation or damnation; and that\nwhen they know it is hard at hand? Truly, sirs, when I think of the\nweight of the matter, I wonder at the very best of God’s saints upon\nthe earth that they are no better, and do no more in so weighty a\ncase. I wonder at those whom the world accounteth more holy than\nneeds, and scorns for making too much ado, that they can put off\nChrist and their souls with so little; that they pour not out their\nsouls in every supplication; that they are not more taken up with God;\nthat their thoughts be more serious in preparation for their account.\nI wonder that they be not a hundred times more strict in their lives,\nand more laborious and unwearied in striving for the crown, than they\nare. And for myself, as I am ashamed of my dull and careless heart,\nand of my slow and unprofitable course of life, so the Lord knows I am\nashamed of every sermon that I preach: when I think what I have been\nspeaking of, and who sent me, and that men’s salvation or damnation is\nso much concerned in it, I am ready to tremble lest God should judge\nme as a slighter of His truth and the souls of men, and lest in the\nbest sermon I should be guilty of their blood. Methinks we should not\nspeak a word to men in matters of such consequence without tears, or\nthe greatest earnestness that possibly we can: were not we too much\nguilty of the sin which we reprove, it would be so. Whether we are\nalone, or in company, methinks our end, and such an end, should still\nbe in our mind, and before our eyes; and we should sooner forget\nanything, and set light by anything, or by all things, than by this.",
        "Consider, 4. Who is it that sends this weighty message to you? Is it\nnot God Himself? Shall the God of heaven speak and men make light of\nit? You would not slight the voice of an angel or a prince.",
        "5. Whose salvation is it that you make light of? Is it not your own?\nAre you no more near or dear to yourselves than to make light of your\nown happiness or misery? Why, sirs, do you not care whether you be\nsaved or damned? Is self-love lost? are you turned your own enemies?\nAs he that slighteth his meat doth slight his life, so if you slight\nChrist, whatsoever you may think, you will find it was your own\nsalvation that you slighted. Hear what He saith, “All they that hate\nme love death.”",
        "6. Your sin is greater, in that you profess to believe the gospel\nwhich you make so light of. For a profest infidel to do it that\nbelieves not that ever Christ died, or rose again, or doth not believe\nthat there is a heaven or hell, this were no such marvel–but for you,\nthat make it your creed, and your very religion, and call yourselves\nChristians, and have been baptized into this faith, and seemed to\nstand to it, this is the wonder, and hath no excuse. What! believe\nthat you shall live in endless joy or torment, and yet make no more of\nit to escape torment, and obtain that joy! What! believe that God will\nshortly judge you, and yet make no preparation for it! Either say\nplainly, I am no Christian, I do not believe these wonderful things,\nI will believe nothing but what I see, or else let your hearts be\naffected with your belief, and live as you say you do believe. What do\nyou think when you repeat the creed, and mention Christ’s judgment and\neverlasting life?",
        "7. What are these things you set so much by as to prefer them before\nChrist and the saving of your soul? Have you found a better friend, a\ngreater and a surer happiness than this? Good Lord! what dung is it\nthat men make so much of, while they set so light by everlasting\nglory? What toys are they that are daily taken up with, while matters\nof life and death are neglected? Why, sirs, if you had every one a\nkingdom in your hopes, what were it in comparison of the everlasting\nkingdom? I can not but look upon all the glory and dignity of this\nworld, lands and lordships, crowns and kingdoms, even as on some\nbrain-sick, beggarly fellow, that borroweth fine clothes, and plays\nthe part of a king or a lord for an hour on a stage, and then comes\ndown, and the sport is ended, and they are beggars again. Were it not\nfor God’s interest in the authority of magistrates, or for the service\nthey might do Him, I should judge no better of them. For, as to their\nown glory, it is but a smoke: what matter is it whether you live poor\nor rich, unless it were a greater matter to die rich than it is? You\nknow well enough that death levels all. What matter is it at judgment,\nwhether you be to answer for the life of a rich man or a poor man? Is\nDives, then, any better than Lazarus? Oh, that men knew what poor,\ndeceiving shadow they grasp at while they let go the everlasting\nsubstance! The strongest, and richest, and most voluptuous sinners do\nbut lay in fuel for their sorrows, while they think they are gathering\ntogether a treasure. Alas! they are asleep, and dream that they are\nhappy; but when they awake, what a change will they find! Their crown\nis made of thorns; their pleasure hath such a sting as will stick in\nthe heart through all eternity, except unfeigned repentance do prevent\nit. Oh, how sadly will these wretches be convinced ere long, what a\nfoolish bargain they made in selling Christ and their salvation for\nthese trifles! Let your farms and merchandise, then, save you, if they\ncan, and do that for you that Christ would have done. Cry then to\nBaal, to save thee! Oh, what thoughts have drunkards and adulterers,\netc., of Christ, that will not part with the basest lust for Him? “For\na piece of bread,” saith Solomon, “such men do transgress.”",
        "8. To set so light by Christ and salvation is a certain mark that thou\nhast no part in them, and if thou so continue, that Christ will set\nas light by thee: “Those that honor him he will honor, and those that\ndespise him shall be lightly esteemed.” Thou wilt feel one day that\nthou canst not live without Him; thou wilt confess then thy need of\nHim; and then thou mayest go look for a savior where thou wilt; for He\nwill be no Savior for thee hereafter, that wouldst not value Him, and\nsubmit to Him here. Then who will prove the loser by thy contempt? Oh,\nwhat a thing will it be for a poor miserable soul to cry to Christ for\nhelp in the day of extremity, and to hear so sad an answer as this!\nThou didst set lightly by Me and My law in the day of thy prosperity,\nand I will now set as light by thee in the day of thy adversity.\nRead Prov. i., 24, to the end. Thou that, as Esau, didst sell thy\nbirthright for a mess of pottage, shalt then find no place for\nrepentance, tho thou seek it with tears. Do you think that Christ shed\nHis blood to save them that continue to make light of it? and to save\nthem, that value a cup of drink or a lust before His salvation? I tell\nyou, sirs, tho you set so light by Christ and salvation, God doth not\nso: He will not give them on such terms as these: He valueth the blood\nof His Son, and the everlasting glory, and He will make you value them\nif ever you have them. Nay, this will be thy condemnation, and leaveth\nno remedy. All the world can not save him that sets lightly by Christ.\nNone of them shall taste of His supper. Nor can you blame Him to deny\nyou what you made light of yourselves. Can you find fault if you miss\nof the salvation which you slighted?",
        "9. The time is near when Christ and salvation will not be made light\nof as now they are. When God hath shaken those careless souls out of\ntheir bodies, and you must answer for all your sins in your own name,\noh, then, what would you not give for a Savior! When a thousand bills\nshall be brought in against you, and none to relieve you, then you\nwill consider, Oh! Christ would now have stood between me and the\nwrath of God; had I not despised Him, He would have answered all.\nWhen you see the world hath left you, and your companions in sin have\ndeceived themselves and you, and all your merry days are gone, then\nwhat would you not give for that Christ and salvation that now you\naccount not worth your labor! Do you think that when you see the\njudgment seat, and you are doomed to everlasting perdition for your\nwickedness, that you should then make as light of Christ as now? Why\nwill you not judge now as you know you shall judge then? Will He then\nbe worth ten thousand worlds? And is He not now worth your highest\nestimation and dearest affection?",
        "10. God will not only deny thee that salvation thou madest light of,\nbut He will take from thee all that which thou didst value before it:\nhe that most highly esteems Christ shall have Him, and the creatures,\nso far as they are good here, and Him without the creature hereafter,\nbecause the creature is not useful; and he that sets more by the\ncreature than by Christ, shall have some of the creature without\nChrist here, and neither Christ nor it hereafter.",
        "So much of these considerations, which may show the true face of this\nheinous sin.",
        "What think you now, friends, of this business? Do you not see by this\ntime what a case that soul is in that maketh light of Christ and\nsalvation? What need then is there that you should take heed lest this\nshould prove your own case! The Lord knows it is too common a case.\nWhoever is found guilty at the last of this sin, it were better for\nthat man he had never been born. It were better for him he had been a\nTurk or Indian, that never had heard the name of a Savior, and that\nnever had salvation offered to him: for such men “have no cloak for\ntheir sin.” Besides all the rest of their sins, they have this killing\nsin to answer for, which will undo them. And this will aggravate their\nmisery, that Christ whom they set light by must be their Judge, and\nfor this sin will He judge them. Oh, that such would now consider how\nthey will answer that question that Christ put to their predecessors:\n\"How will ye escape the damnation of hell” or, “How shall we escape if\nwe neglect so great salvation?” Can you escape without a Christ? or\nwill a despised Christ save you then? If he be accurst that sets light\nby father or mother, what then is he that sets light by Christ? It was\nthe heinous sin of the Jews, that among them were found such as set\nlight by father and mother. But among us, men slight the Father of\nSpirits! In the name of God, brethren, I beseech you to consider how\nyou will then bear this anger which you now make light of! You that\ncan not make light of a little sickness or want, or of natural death,\nno, not of a toothache, but groan as if you were undone; how will you\nthen make light of the fury of the Lord, which will burn against the\ncontemners of His grace! Doth it not behoove you beforehand to think\nof these things?",
        "Dearly beloved in the Lord, I have now done that work which I came\nupon; what effect it hath, or will have, upon your hearts, I know not,\nnor is it any further in my power to accomplish that which my soul\ndesireth for you. Were it the Lord’s will that I might have my wish\nherein, the words that you have this day heard should so stick by you\nthat the secure should be awakened by them, and none of you should\nperish by the slighting of your salvation. I can not follow you\nto your several habitations to apply this word to your particular\nnecessities; but oh, that I could make every man’s conscience a\npreacher to himself that it might do it, which is ever with you!\nThat the next time you go prayerless to bed, or about your business,\nconscience might cry out, Dost thou set no more by Christ and thy\nsalvation? That the next time you are tempted to think hardly of a\nholy and diligent life (I will not say to deride it as more ado than\nneeds), conscience might cry out to thee, Dost thou set so light by\nChrist and thy salvation? That the next time you are ready to rush\nupon unknown sin, and to please your fleshly desires against the\ncommand of God, conscience might cry out, Is Christ and salvation no\nmore worth than to cast them away, or venture them for thy lust?\nThat when you are following the world with your most eager desires,\nforgetting the world to come, and the change that is a little before\nyou, conscience might cry out to you, Is Christ and salvation no more\nworth than so? That when you are next spending the Lord’s day in\nidleness or vain sports, conscience might tell you what you are doing.\nIn a word, that in all your neglects of duty, your sticking at the\nsupposed labor or cost of a godly life, yea, in all your cold and lazy\nprayers and performances, conscience might tell you how unsuitable\nsuch endeavors are to the reward; and that Christ and salvation should\nnot be so slighted. I will say no more but this at this time, it is a\nthousand pities that when God hath provided a Savior for the world,\nand when Christ hath suffered so much for their sins, and made so full\na satisfaction to justice, and purchased so glorious a kingdom for\nHis saints, and all this is offered so freely to sinners, to lost,\nunworthy sinners, even for nothing, that yet so many millions should\neverlastingly perish because they make light of their Savior and\nsalvation, and prefer the vain world and their lusts before them. I\nhave delivered my message, the Lord open your hearts to receive it.\nI have persuaded you with the word of truth and soberness; the Lord\npersuade you more effectually, or else all this is lost. Amen.",
        "THE FUNERAL SERMON ON THE DEATH OF THE GRANDE CONDÉ",
        "Jacque Benigne Bossuet was born at Dijon, in Burgundy, in 1627. In an\nillustrious group of French Catholic preachers he occupied a foremost\nplace. In beginning his sermons he was reserved and dignified, but as\nhe moved forward and his passionate utterance captured his hearers,\n\"he watched their rising emotion, the rooted glances of a thousand\neyes filled him with a sort of divine frenzy, his notes became a\nburden and a hindrance, and with impetuous ardor he abandoned himself\nto the inspiration of the moment.”",
        "To ripe scholarship Bossuet added a voice that was deep and sonorous,\nan imposing personality, and an animated and graceful style of\ngesture. Lamartine says he had “a voice which, like that of the\nthunder in the clouds, or the organ in the cathedral, had never been\nanything but the medium of power and divine persuasion to the soul; a\nvoice which only spoke to kneeling auditors; a voice which spoke in\nthe name of God, an authority of language unequaled upon earth,\nand against which the lowest murmur was impious and the smallest\nopposition blasphemy.” He died in 1704.",
        "THE FUNERAL SERMON ON THE DEATH OF THE GRANDE CONDÉ",
        "In beginning this address, in which I purpose to celebrate the\nimmortal glory of Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, I feel myself\noverweighted both by the grandeur of the subject and, to be frank, by\nthe fruitlessness of the effort. What part of the inhabited world has\nnot heard of the victories of the Prince de Condé and the wonders of\nhis life? They are recounted everywhere; the Frenchman who boasts of\nthem in the presence of the foreigner tells him nothing which the\nlatter does not know; and in no matter how exalted a strain I might\nsound his praises, I should still feel that in your hearts you were\nconvinced that I deserved the reproach of falling far short of doing\nhim justice. An orator, feeble as he is, can not do anything for the\nperpetuation of the glory of extraordinary souls. Le Sage was right\nwhen he said that “their deeds alone can praise them\"; no other praise\nis of any effect where great names are concerned; and it needs but the\nsimple story of his deeds faithfully recorded to sustain the glory of\nthe Prince de Condé.",
        "But, while awaiting the appearance of the history which is to tell the\nstory of his life to coming ages, it is necessary to satisfy as best\nwe may the public recognition of his merit and bow to the order of the\ngreatest of all sovereigns. What does not the kingdom owe to a prince\nwho has honored the house of France, the French name, his century,\nand, so to speak, all mankind? Louis the Great himself shares these\nsentiments; after having mourned this great man, and by his tears,\nshed in the presence of his entire court, rather than by words,\nuttered the most glorious eulogy he could receive, he assembled\ntogether in this celebrated temple all that is most august in his\nrealm, in order that the last rites to the memory of this prince might\nthere be celebrated; and he wishes that my feeble voice should animate\nall this funeral equipage. Let us try, then, to forget our grief. Here\nan object greater and worthier of this pulpit presents itself to my\nmind: it is God, who makes warriors and conquerors. “It is Thou,” said\nDavid unto Him, “who hast trained my hand to battle, and my fingers to\nhold the sword.” If He inspires courage, no less is He the bestower of\nother great qualities, both of heart and of mind. His mighty hand is\nthe source of everything; it is He who sends from heaven generous\nsentiments, wise counsels and every worthy thought. But He wishes\nus to know how to distinguish between the gifts He abandons to His\nenemies and those He reserves for His servants. What distinguishes His\nfriends from all others is piety. Until this gift of heaven has been\nreceived, all others not only are as naught, but even bring ruin on\nthose who are endowed with them; without this inestimable gift of\npiety what would the Prince de Condé have been, even with his great\nheart and great genius? No, my brethren, if piety had not, as it were,\nconsecrated his other virtues, these princes would have found no\nconsolation for their grief, nor this pontiff any confidence in his\nprayers, nor would I myself utter with conviction the praises which I\nowe so great a man.",
        "Let us, by this example, then set human glory at naught; let us\ndestroy the idol of the ambitious, that it might fall to pieces before\nthis altar. Let us to-day join together (for with a subject so noble\nwe may do it) all the finest qualities of a superior nature; and, for\nthe glory of truth, let us demonstrate, in a prince admired of the\nuniverse, that what makes heroes, that what carries to the highest\npitch worldly glory, worth, magnanimity, natural goodness–all\nattributes of the heart; vivacity, penetration, grandeur and sublimity\nof genius–attributes of the mind; would be but an illusion were piety\nnot a part of them–in a word, that piety is the essence of the man.\nIt is this, gentlemen, which you will see in the forever memorable\nlife of the most high and mighty Prince Louis de Bourbon, Prince de\nCondé, first prince of the blood.",
        "God has revealed to us that He alone creates conquerors, and that He\nmakes them serve His designs. What other created a Cyrus if it is\nnot God, who named him two hundred years before his birth in the\nProphecies of Isaiah? “Thou art as yet unborn,” He said unto him, “but\nI see thee, and I named thee by thy name; thou shalt be called Cyrus.\nI will walk before thee in battle, at thy approach I will put kings to\nflight; I will break down doors of brass. It is I that stretch out the\nheavens, that support the earth, that name that which is not as that\nwhich is,” that is to say, it is I that create everything and I that\nsee, from eternity, all that I create. What other could fashion an\nAlexander, if it is not this same God who caused the unquenchable\nardor of Daniel, His prophet, to see from so great a distance and by\nmeans of foreshadowings so vivid. “Do you see him,” he says, “this\nconqueror; with what rapidity he rises from the west by bounds, as it\nwere, and touches not the earth?”",
        "In the boldness of his leaps, and the lightness of his tread like unto\nsome powerful and frisking beast, he advances by quick and impetuous\nbounds, and nor mountain nor precipice arrests his progress. Already\nhas the King of Persia fallen into his hands. “At his sight he was\nexasperated; efferatus est in eum,” says the prophet; “he strikes\nhim down, he tramples him under foot; none can save him from his blows\nnor cheat him of his prey.” But to hear these words of Daniel, whom\nwould you suppose you perceived, gentlemen, under that figure of\nspeech–Alexander or the Prince de Condé? God gave him that dauntless\nvalor that France might enjoy safety during the minority of a king but\nfour years old. Let him grow up, this king, cherished of Heaven, and\nall will yield to his exploits; rising above his own followers, as\nwell as his enemies, he will know how sometimes to make use of, and\nat others to dispense with, his most illustrious captains, and alone,\nunder the hand of God, who will be his constant aid, he will be seen\nto be the stanch rampart of his dominions. But God chose the Duc\nd’Enghien to defend him in his infancy. So, toward the first days of\nhis reign, at the age of twenty-two years, the duke conceived a plan\nin the armor of which the seasoned veterans could find no vulnerable\npoint; but victory justified his course at Rocroi. The opposing force,\nit is true, is stronger; it is composed of those old Walloon, Italian\nand Spanish regiments that, up to that time, could not be broken; but\nat what valuation should be placed the courage inspired in our troops\nby the pressing necessities of the state, by past successes, and by\na young prince of the blood in whose eyes could be read victory? Don\nFrancisco de Mellos awaits the onset with a firm foot; and, without\nbeing able to retreat, the two generals and the two armies seemed to\nhave wished to imprison themselves in the woods and the marshes in\norder to decide the issue of combat like two champions in the lists.",
        "Then what a sight is presented to the eye! the young prince appears\nanother man; touched by an object so worthy, his great soul displays\nall its sublimity; his courage waxes with the dangers it has to\nencounter, and his penetration becomes keener as his ardor increases.\nThat night, which had to be spent in the presence of the enemy, like\nthe vigilant commander that he was, he was the last to retire. But\nnever were his slumbers more peaceful. On the eve of so momentous\na day, when the first battle is to be fought, his mind is entirely\ntranquil, so thoroughly is he in his element; and it is well known\nthat on the morrow, at the hour he had indicated, it was necessary to\nawaken this second Alexander from a deep slumber. Do you see him as\nhe rushes on to victory or death? No sooner had he inspired the ranks\nwith the ardor with which his soul was animated than he was seen\nalmost at the same time to press the right wing of the enemy, support\nour own shaken by the shock of the charge, rally the disheartened\nand almost vanquished French forces, put to flight the victorious\nSpaniards, carrying dismay everywhere, and terrifying by his lightning\nglances those who escape his blows. There still remained that dreaded\ninfantry of the Spanish army, whose great battalions in close line of\nbattle like so many towers, but towers which knew how to repair their\nbreaches, were unshaken by the onset, and, tho the rest of the army\nwas put to rout, maintained a steady fire. Thrice the young conqueror\nattempted to break the ranks of these intrepid warriors, thrice was\nhe repulsed by the valorous Comte de Fontaines, who was borne to\nthe scene of combat in his invalid’s chair, by reason of his bodily\ninfirmities, thus demonstrating that the warrior’s soul has the\nascendant over the body it animates.",
        "But at last was he forced to yield. In vain does Beck, with a body of\nfresh cavalry, hasten his march through the woods in order to attack\nour exhausted soldiers; the prince has forestalled him; the defeated\nbattalions are asking quarter. But victory for the Duc d’Enghien was\ndestined to be more terrible than the combat. While with an air\nof confidence he advances to receive the surrender of these brave\nfellows, they, on their part, still on their guard, are in dread of\nbeing surprized by a fresh attack. The frightful havoc wrought by the\ndischarge of their musketry infuriates our troops. Carnage is now\nrampant; the bloodshed intoxicates the soldiers to a high degree. But\nthe prince, who could not bear to see these lions slaughtered like so\nmany lambs, calmed their overwrought feeling and enhanced the pleasure\nof victory by that of pardoning the vanquished. What, then, was the\nastonishment of these veteran troops and their brave officers when\nthey perceived that their only salvation was to give themselves up to\ntheir conqueror! With what wonder did they regard the young prince,\nwhose victory had rendered still more impressive his customary proud\nbearing, to which, however, his clemency had imparted a new grace.\nHow willingly would he have saved the life of the brave Comte de\nFontaines, but unhappily he lay stretched upon the field of battle\namong the thousands of dead bodies, those whose loss is still kept by\nSpain. Spain knew not that the prince who caused her the loss of so\nmany of her old regiments on the day of Rocroi was to finish the rest\non the plains of Lens.",
        "Thus the first victory was the guarantee of many others. The prince\nbent his knee and on the field of battle rendered to the Lord of Hosts\nthe glory He had sent him. There was celebrated the deliverance of\nRocroi, and thanksgivings were uttered that the threats of a once\ndreaded enemy had resulted in his own shameful defeat; that the\nregency was strengthened, France calmed, and a reign which was to\nbe so illustrious begun by an augury so auspicious. The army led\nin thanksgiving; all France followed; the first venture of the Duc\nd’Enghien was lauded to the skies. Praise sufficient to render others\nforever illustrious; but for him it was but the first stage in his\ncareer!",
        "As a result of this first campaign, and after the capture of\nThionville–a prize worthy of the victory gained at Rocroi–he was\nregarded as an adversary equally to be feared in sieges and in\nbattles. But there is one trait in the character of the victorious\nyoung prince no less admirable than that which was brought out by\nvictory. The court, which at his arrival was prepared to welcome him\nwith the plaudits he deserved, was surprized at the manner in which\nhe received them. The queen-regent assured him that the king was well\npleased with his services. This from the lips of his sovereign was\na fitting recompense for his labors. If others dared to praise him,\nhowever, he treated their eulogies as insults, and, impatient of\nflattery, he was in dread even of its semblance. Such was the\ndelicacy, or rather the solidity of character, of this prince.\nMoreover his maxim was (listen, for it is a maxim which makes great\nmen), that, in the performance of great deeds, one’s sole thought\nshould be to perform them well, and leave glory to follow in the train\nof virtue. It is this which he has endeavored to instil into others,\nand by this principle has he himself ever been guided. Thus false\nglory had no temptation for him. It was with truth and greatness alone\nthat he was concerned.",
        "Thus it came about that his glory was wrapt up in the service of his\nkind and in the happiness and well-being of the state; They were the\nobjects nearest his heart; these were his first and most cherished\ndesires. The court had but little charm for him, or occupation suited\nto his talents, tho he was there regarded as its greatest hero. It was\ndeemed needful to exhibit everywhere in Germany, as in Flanders, the\nintrepid defender whom God had given us. Remark well what is about to\ntranspire: There is being formed against the prince an enterprise of a\nmore formidable nature than, that at Rocroi; and, in order to put his\ntalents to the test, warfare is about to drain all its resources, and\ncall to its aid every known invention. What is it that is presented\nto my vision? I see not merely men to meet in combat but inaccessible\nmountains: on one side are ravines and precipices; on the other\nimpenetrable forests in the heart of which are marshes, and in\nproximity to streams are impregnable intrenchments; everywhere are\nlofty fortresses and forests of felled trees lying across roads which\nare frightful; and there arises Merci, with his worthy Bavarians\ninflated by the large measure of success which has fallen to their\narms and by the capture of Fribourg; Merci, whom none has ever seen\nretreat from the combat; Merci, whom the Prince de Condé and the\nvigilant Turenne have never surprized in a movement that was not in\naccord with the rales of warfare, and to whom they have conceded this\ngreat mark of admiration–that never has he lost a single favorable\nopportunity, nor failed to anticipate their designs as tho he had\ntaken part in their councils.",
        "Here, then, in the course of eight days, and by four separate attacks,\nis seen how much can be supported and undertaken in war. Our troops\nseem as much dispirited by the frightful condition of the field of\nbattle as by the resistance of the enemy, and for a time the prince\nsees himself, so to speak, abandoned. But like a second Maccabee,\n\"his right arm abandons him not, and his courage, inflamed by so many\nperils, came to his aid.” No sooner had he been seen on foot the first\nto scale those inaccessible heights, than his ardor drew the whole\narmy after him. Merci sees himself lost beyond redemption; his best\nregiments are defeated; nightfall is the salvation of the remainder of\nhis army. But a severe rainstorm serves to add to our difficulties and\ndiscouragements, so that we have at the same time to contend with not\nonly the highest courage and the perfection of art, but the forces of\nnature as well. In spite of the advantage that an enemy, as able as he\nis bold, takes of these conditions, and the fact that he intrenches\nhimself anew in his impregnable mountains, hard prest on every side,\nhe is forced not only to allow his cannon and baggage to fall a prey\nto the Duc d’Enghien, but also the country bordering the Rhine. See\nhow everything is shaken to its foundation: Philipsburg is in dire\ndistress in ten days, in spite of the winter now close at hand;\nPhilipsburg, which so long held the Rhine captive under our laws,\nand whose loss the greatest of kings so gloriously retrieved. Worms,\nSpire, Mayence, Landau, twenty other places I might name, open their\nportals: Merci is unable to defend them, and no longer faces his\nconqueror. It is not enough; he must fall at his feet, a worthy victim\nof his valor. Nordlingen will witness his overthrow; it will there\nbe admitted that it is no more possible to withstand the French in\nGermany than in Flanders. And all these benefits we will owe to this\nself-same prince. God, the protector of France and of a king whom He\nhas destined to perform His great works, thus ordains ...",
        "It was not merely for a son nor for his family that he had such tender\nsentiments: I have seen him (and do not think that I here speak in\nterms of exaggeration), I have seen him deeply moved by the perils of\nhis friends. Simple and natural as he was, I have seen his features\nbetray his emotions at the story of their misfortunes, and he was ever\nready to confer with them on the most insignificant details as well as\non affairs of the utmost importance. In the adjustment of quarrels, he\nwas ever ready to soothe turbulent spirits with a patience and good\nnature that one would little have expected from a disposition so\nexcitable, nor from a character so lofty. What a contrast to heroes\ndevoid of human sympathy! Well might the latter command respect and\ncharm the admiration, as do all extraordinary things, but they will\nnot win the heart. When God fashioned the heart of man and endowed him\nwith human affection, He first of all inspired him with the quality\nof kindness, like unto the essence of the divine nature itself, as a\ntoken of the beneficent hand that fashioned us. Kindness, therefore,\nought to be the mainspring and guide of our heart, and ought at the\nsame time to be the chief attraction that should, as it were, be\na part of our very being, with which to win the hearts of others.\nGreatness, which is but the result of good fortune, so far from\ndiminishing the quality of kindness, is but given one that he might\nthe more freely spread broadcast its beneficent effects like a public\nfountain, which is but erected that its waters might be scattered to\nthe sunlight.",
        "This is the value of a good heart; and the great who are devoid of\nthe quality of kindness, justly punished for their disdainful\ninsensibility to the misfortunes of their fellows, are forever\ndeprived of the greatest blessing of human life–that is to say, of\nthe pleasures of society. Never did man enjoy these pleasures more\nkeenly than the prince of whom I am speaking; never was man less\ninspired with the misgiving that familiarity breeds contempt. Is this\nthe man who carried cities by storm and won great battles? Verily, he\nseems to have forgotten the high rank he so well knew how to\nsustain. Do you not recognize in him the hero, who, ever equable and\nconsistent, never having to stand on tiptoe to seem taller than he is,\nnor to stoop to be courteous and obliging, found himself by nature\nall that a man ought to be toward his fellow, like a majestic and\nbountiful stream, which peacefully bears into the cities the abundance\nit has spread in the fields that it has watered, which gives to all\nand never rises above its normal height, nor becomes swollen except\nwhen violent opposition is offered to the gentle slope by which it\ncontinues on its tranquil course. Such, indeed, has also been the\ngentleness and such the might of the Prince de Condé. Have you a\nsecret of importance? Confide it boldly to the safe-keeping of this\nnoble heart; he will reward your confidence by making your affair his\nown. To this prince nothing is more inviolable than the sacred rights\nof friendship. When a favor is asked of him he acts as tho he himself\nwere under obligation; and never has a joy keener and truer been\nwitnessed than he felt at being able to give pleasure to another.",
        "It was a grand spectacle to see during the same period, and in the\nsame campaigns, these two men, who in the common opinion of all Europe\ncould be favorably compared to the greatest captains of past ages,\nsometimes at the head of different bodies of troops; sometimes united\nmore indeed by the concord of their thoughts than by the orders which\nthe subaltern received from his superior; sometimes at the head of\nopposing forces, and each redoubling his customary activity and\nvigilance, as tho God, who, according to the Scriptures, often in His\nwisdom makes a sport of the universe, had desired to show mortals the\nwonders in all their forms that He could work with men. Behold the\nencampments, the splendid marches, the audacity, the precautions, the\nperils, the resources of these brave men! Has there ever been beheld\nin two men virtues such as these in characters so different, not to\nsay diametrically opposite? The one appears to be guided by deep\nreflection, the other by sudden illumination; the latter as a\nconsequence, tho more impetuous, yet never acting with undue\nprecipitation; the former, colder of manner, tho never slow, is bolder\nof action than of speech, and even while having the outward appearance\nof embarrassment, inwardly determined and resolved. The one, from the\nmoment he appears in the army, conveys an exalted idea of his\nworth and makes one expect of him something out of the ordinary;\nnevertheless, he advanced in regular order, and performed, as it\nwere, by degrees, the prodigious deeds which marked the course of his\ncareer. The other, like a man inspired from the date of his first\nbattle, showed himself the equal of the most consummate masters of the\nart of warfare. The one by his prompt and continued efforts commanded\nthe admiration of the human race and silenced the voice of envy; the\nother shone so resplendently from the very beginning that none dared\nattack him. The one, in a word, by the depth of his genius and the\nincredible resources of his courage, rose superior to the greatest\nperils and even knew how to profit by every kind of fickleness of\nfortune; the other, by reason of the advantages derived from high\nbirth, by his great conceptions derived from Heaven, and by a kind of\nadmirable instinct, the secret of which is not given to ordinary\nmen, seemed born to mold fortune to conform to his designs and bring\ndestiny to his feet. And that the great tho diverse characters of\nthese two men might be clearly discerned, it should be borne in mind\nthat the one, his career cut short by an unexpected blow, died for his\ncountry like another Judas Maccabeus, mourned by the army as for a\nfather, while the court and all the people, lamented his fate. His\npiety as well as his courage were universally lauded, and his memory\nwill never fade from the minds of men. The other, raised to the very\nsummit of glory by force of arms like another David, dies like him in\nhis bed, sounding the praises of God and leaving his dying behests to\nhis family, while all hearts were imprest as much by the splendor of\nhis life as by the gentleness of his death.",
        "THE HEAVENLY FOOTMAN",
        "John Bunyan was born in the village of Elstow, near Bedford, England,\nin 1628. Because of his fearless preaching he was imprisoned in\nBedford jail from 1660 to 1672, and again for six months in 1675,\nduring which latter time it is said his wonderful “Pilgrim’s Progress\"\nwas written. While his sermons in their tedious prolixity share the\nfault of his time, they are characterized by vividness, epigrammatic\nwit, and dramatic fervor. The purity and simplicity of his style\nhave been highly praised, and his unflinching faith has been the\ninspiration of many a hesitating soul. Among his best known works are\n\"The Holy War,” “Grace Abounding in the Chief of Sinners,” and “Sighs\nfrom Hell.” He died in London in 1688.",

        "So run that ye may obtain.–I Cor. ix., 24.",
        "Heaven and happiness is that which every one desireth, insomuch that\nwicked Balaam could say, “Let me die the death of the righteous, and\nlet my last end be like his.” Yet, for all this, there are but very\nfew that do obtain that ever-to-be-desired glory, insomuch that many\neminent professors drop short of a welcome from God into this pleasant\nplace. The apostle, therefore, because he did desire the salvation of\nthe souls of the Corinthians, to whom he writes this epistle, layeth\nthem down in these words such counsel, which if taken, would be for\ntheir help and advantage.",
        "First, Not to be wicked, and sit still, and wish for heaven; but to\nrun for it.",
        "Secondly, Not to content themselves with, every kind of running, but,\nsaith he, “So run that ye may obtain.” As if he should say, some,\nbecause they would not lose their souls, begin to run betimes, they\nrun apace, they run with patience, they run the right way. Do you so\nrun. Some run from both father and mother, friends and companions,\nand thus, they may have the crown. Do you so run. Some run through\ntemptations, afflictions, good report, evil report, that they may win\nthe pearl. Do you so run. “So run that ye may obtain.”",
        "These words were taken from men’s funning for a wager; a very apt\nsimilitude to set before the eyes of the saints of the Lord. “Know you\nthat they which run in a race run all, but one obtaineth the prize? So\nrun that ye may obtain.” That is, do not only run, but be sure you win\nas well as run. “So run that ye may obtain.”",
        "I shall not need to make any great ado in opening the words at this\ntime, but shall rather lay down one doctrine that I do find in them;\nand in prosecuting that, I shall show you, in some measure, the scope\nof the words.",
        "The doctrine is this: They that will have heaven, must run for it; I\nsay, they that will have heaven, they must run for it. I beseech you\nto heed it well. “Know ye not, that they which run in a race run all,\nbut one obtaineth the prize? So run ye.” The prize is heaven, and if\nyou will have it, you must run for it. You have another scripture\nfor this in the xii. of the Hebrews, the 1st, 2d, and 3d verses:\n\"Wherefore seeing also,” saith the apostle, “that we are compassed\nabout with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every\nweight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with\npatience the race that is set before us.” And let us run, saith he.\nAgain, saith Paul, “I so run, not as uncertainly: so fight I,” etc.",
        "But before I go any farther:",
        "1. Fleeing. Observe, that this running is not an ordinary, or any\nsort of running, but it is to be understood of the swiftest sort of\nrunning; and therefore, in the vi. of the Hebrews, it is called a\nfleeing: “That we might have strong consolation, who have fled for\nrefuge, to lay hold on the hope set before us.” Mark, who have fled.\nIt is taken from that xx. of Joshua, concerning the man that was to\nflee to the city of refuge, when the avenger of blood was hard at his\nheels, to take vengeance on him for the offense he had committed;\ntherefore it is a running or fleeing for one’s life: a running with\nall might and main, as we use to say. So run.",
        "2. Pressing. Secondly, this running in another place is called a\npressing. “I press toward the mark\"; which signifieth, that they that\nwill have heaven, they must not stick at any difficulties they meet\nwith; but press, crowd, and thrust through all that may stand between\nheaven and their souls. So run.",
        "3. Continuing. Thirdly, this running is called in another place, a\ncontinuing in the way of life. “If you continue in the faith grounded,\nand settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel of\nChrist.” Not to run a little now and then, by fits and starts, or\nhalf-way, or almost thither, but to run for my life, to run through\nall difficulties, and to continue therein to the end of the race,\nwhich must be to the end of my life. “So run that ye may obtain.” And\nthe reasons are:",
        "(1.) Because all or every one that runneth doth not obtain the prize;\nthere may be many that do run, yea, and run far too, who yet miss of\nthe crown that standeth at the end of the race. You know all that run\nin a race do not obtain the victory; they all run, but one wins. And\nso it is here; it is not every one that runneth, nor every one that\nseeketh, nor every one that striveth for the mastery that hath it.\n\"Tho a man do strive for the mastery,” saith Paul, “yet he is not\ncrowned, unless he strive lawfully\"; that is, unless he so run, and so\nstrive, as to have God’s approbation. What, do you think that every\nheavy-heeled professor will have heaven? What, every lazy one? every\nwanton and foolish professor, that will be stopt by anything, kept\nback by anything, that scarce runneth so fast heavenward as a snail\ncreepeth on the ground? Nay, there are some professors that do not go\non so fast in the way of God as a snail doth go on the wall; and yet\nthese think that heaven and happiness is for them. But stay, there are\nmany more that run than there be that obtain; therefore he that will\nhave heaven must run for it.",
        "(2.) Because you know, that tho a man do run, yet if he do not\novercome, or win, as well as run, what will they be the better for\ntheir running? They will get nothing. You know the man that runneth,\nhe doth do it to win the prize; but if he doth not obtain it, he doth\nlose his labor, spend his pains and time, and that to no purpose; I\nsay, he getteth nothing. And ah! how many such runners will there be\nfound in the day of judgment? Even multitudes, multitudes that have\nrun, yea, run so far as to come to heaven-gates, and not able to get\nany farther, but there stand knocking when it is too late, crying,\nLord! Lord! when they have nothing but rebukes for their pains. Depart\nfrom Me, you come not here, you come too late, you run too lazily; the\ndoor is shut. “When once the master of the house is risen up,” saith\nChrist, “and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and\nto knock, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us, I will say, I know you not,\ndepart,” etc. Oh, sad will the state of those be that run and miss;\ntherefore, if you will have heaven, you must run for it; and “so run\nthat ye may obtain.”",
        "(3.) Because the way is long (I speak metaphorically), and there is\nmany a dirty step, many a high hill, much work to do, a wicked heart,\nworld, and devil to overcome; I say, there are many steps to be taken\nby those that intend to be saved, by running or walking in the steps\nof that faith of our father Abraham. Out of Egypt thou must go through\nthe Red Sea; thou must run a long and tedious journey, through the\nvast howling wilderness, before thou come to the land of promise.",
        "(4.) They that will go to heaven they must run for it; because, as the\nway is long, so the time in which they are to get to the end of it is\nvery uncertain; the time present is the only time; thou hast no more\ntime allotted thee than thou now enjoyest: “Boast not thyself of\nto-morrow, for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.” Do not\nsay, I have time enough to get to heaven seven years hence; for I tell\nthee, the bell may toll for thee before seven days more be ended; and\nwhen death comes, away thou must go, whether thou art provided or not;\nand therefore look to it; make no delays; it is not good dallying with\nthings of so great concernment as the salvation or damnation of thy\nsoul. You know he that hath a great way to go in a little time, and\nless by half than he thinks of, he had need to run for it.",
        "(5.) They that will have heaven, they must run for it; because the\ndevil, the law, sin, death, and hell follow them. There is never a\npoor soul that is going to heaven, but the devil, the law, sin, death,\nand hell, make after the soul. “The devil, your adversary, as a\nroaring lion, goeth about, seeking whom he may devour.” And I will\nassure you, the devil is nimble, he can run apace, he is light of\nfoot, he hath overtaken many, he hath turned up their heels, and hath\ngiven them an everlasting fall. Also the law, that can shoot a great\nway, have a care thou keep out of the reach of those great guns, the\nTen Commandments. Hell also hath a wide mouth; it can stretch itself\nfarther that you are aware of. And as the angel said to Lot, “Take\nheed, look not behind thee, neither tarry thou in all the plain” (that\nis, anywhere between this and heaven), “lest thou be consumed\"; so I\nsay to thee, Take heed, tarry not, lest either the devil, hell or the\nfearful curses of the law of God do overtake thee, and throw thee down\nin the midst of thy sins, so as never to rise and recover again. If\nthis were all considered, then thou, as well as I, wouldst say, They\nthat will have heaven must run for it.",
        "(6.) They that go to heaven must run for it; because perchance the\ngates of heaven may be shut shortly. Sometimes sinners have not\nheaven-gates open to them so long as they suppose; and if they be once\nshut against a man, they are so heavy that all the men in the world,\nnor all the angels in heaven, are not able to open them. “I shut, and\nno man can open,” saith Christ. And how if thou shouldst come but\none quarter of an hour too late? I tell thee, it will cost thee an\neternity to bewail thy misery in. Francis Spira can tell thee what it\nis to stay till the gate of mercy be quite shut; or to run so lazily\nthat they be shut before you get within them. What, to be shut out!\nwhat, out of heaven! Sinner, rather than lose it, run for it; yea,\n\"and so run that thou mayst obtain.”",
        "(7.) Lastly, because if thou lose, thou losest all, thou losest soul,\nGod, Christ, heaven, ease, peace, etc. Besides, thou layest thyself\nopen to all the shame, contempt, and reproach, that either God,\nChrist, saints, the world, sin, the devil, and all can lay upon thee.\nAs Christ saith of the foolish builder, so I will say of thee, if thou\nbe such a one who runs and misses; I say, even all that go by will\nbegin to mock at thee, saying, This man began to run well, but was not\nable to finish. But more of this anon.",
        "Quest. But how should a poor soul do to run? For this very thing is\nthat which afflicteth me sore (as you say), to think that I may run,\nand yet fall short. Methinks to fall short at last, oh, it fears me\ngreatly. Pray tell me, therefore, how I should run.",
        "Ans. That thou mayst indeed be satisfied in this particular, consider\nthese following things.",
        "The first direction: If thou wouldst so run as to obtain the kingdom\nof heaven, then be sure that thou get into the way that leadeth\nthither: For it is a vain thing to think that ever thou shalt have the\nprize, tho thou runnest never so fast, unless thou art in the way that\nleads to it. Set the case, that there should be a man in London that\nwas to run to York for a wager; now, tho he run never so swiftly, yet\nif he run full south, he might run himself quickly out of breath, and\nbe never nearer the prize, but rather the farther off? Just so is it\nhere; it is not simply the runner, nor yet the hasty runner, that\nwinneth the crown, unless he be in the way that leadeth thereto. I\nhave observed, that little time which I have been a professor, that\nthere is a great running to and fro, some this way, and some that way,\nyet it is to be feared most of them are out of the way, and then, tho\nthey run as swift as the eagle can fly, they are benefited nothing at\nall.",
        "Here is one runs a-quaking, another a-ranting; one again runs after\nthe baptism, and another after the Independency: here is one for\nFreewill, and another for Presbytery; and yet possibly most of all\nthese sects run quite the wrong way, and yet every one is for his\nlife, his soul, either for heaven or hell.",
        "If thou now say, Which is the way? I tell thee it is Christ, the Son\nof Mary, the Son of God. Jesus saith, “I am the way, the truth, and\nthe life; no man cometh to the Father but by me.” So then thy business\nis (if thou wouldst have salvation), to see if Christ be thine, with\nall His benefits; whether He hath covered thee with His righteousness,\nwhether He hath showed thee that thy sins are washed away with His\nheart-blood, whether thou art planted into Him, and whether you have\nfaith in Him, so as to make a life out of Him, and to conform thee\nto Him; that is, such faith as to conclude that thou art righteous,\nbecause Christ is thy righteousness, and so constrained to walk with\nHim as the joy of thy heart, because he saveth thy soul. And for the\nLord’s sake take heed, and do not deceive thyself, and think thou art\nin the way upon too slight grounds; for if thou miss of the way, thou\nwilt miss of the prize, and if thou miss of that I am sure thou wilt\nlose thy soul, even that soul which is worth more than the whole\nworld.",
        "Mistrust thy own strength, and throw it away; down on thy knees in\nprayer to the Lord for the spirit of truth; search His word for\ndirection; flee seducers’ company; keep company with the soundest\nChristians, that have most experience of Christ; and be sure thou have\na care of Quakers, Ranters, Free-willers: also do not have too much\ncompany with some Anabaptists, tho I go under that name myself. I\nwill tell thee this is such a serious matter, and I fear thou wilt so\nlittle regard it, that the thought of the worth of the thing, and of\nthy too light regarding of it, doth even make my heart ache whilst I\nam writing to thee. The Lord teach thee the way by His Spirit, and\nthen I am sure thou wilt know it. So run.",
        "The second direction: As thou shouldst get into the way, so thou\nshouldst also be much in studying and musing on the way. You know men\nthat would be expert in anything, they are usually much in studying of\nthat thing, and so likewise is it with those that quickly grow expert\nin any way. This therefore thou shouldst do; let thy study be much\nexercised about Christ, which is the way, what He is, what He hath\ndone, and why He is what He is, and why He hath done what is done; as\nwhy “He took upon Him the form of a servant” (Phil, ii.); why He was\n\"made in the likeness of man\"; why He cried; why He died; why He\n\"bare the sin of the world\"; why He was made sin, and why He was made\nrighteousness; why He is in heaven in the nature of man, and what He\ndoth there. Be much in musing and considering of these things; be\nthinking also enough of those places which thou must not come near,\nbut leave some on this hand, and some on that hand; as it is with\nthose that travel into other countries; they must leave such a gate on\nthis hand, and such a bush on that hand, and go by such a place, where\nstandeth such a thing. Thus therefore you must do: “Avoid such things,\nwhich are expressly forbidden in the Word of God.” Withdraw thy foot\nfar from her, “and come not nigh the door of her house, for her steps\ntake hold of hell, going down to the chambers of death.” And so of\neverything that is not in the way, have a care of it, that thou go not\nby it; come not near it, have nothing to do with it. So run.",
        "The third direction: Not only thus, but in the next place, thou\nmust strip thyself of those things that may hang upon thee, to\nthe hindering of thee in the way to the kingdom of heaven, as\ncovetousness, pride, lust, or whatever else thy heart may be inclining\nunto, which may hinder thee in this heavenly race. Men that run for\na wager, if they intend to win as well as run, they do not use to\nencumber themselves, or carry those things about them that may be a\nhindrance to them in their running. “Every man that striveth for\nthe mastery is temperate in all things\"; that is, he layeth aside\neverything that would be anywise a disadvantage to him; as saith the\napostle, “Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin that doth so\neasily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set\nbefore us.” It is but a vain thing to talk of going to heaven, if\nthou let thy heart be encumbered with those things that would hinder.\nWould you not say that such a man would be in danger of losing, tho\nhe run, if he fill his pockets with stones, hang heavy garments on\nhis shoulders, and get lumpish shoes on his feet? So it is here;\nthou talkest of going to heaven, and yet fillest thy pockets with\nstones–i.e., fillest thy heart with this world, lettest that hang\non thy shoulders, with its profits and pleasures. Alas! alas! thou art\nwidely mistaken: if thou intendest to win, thou must strip, thou must\nlay aside every weight, thou must be temperate in all things. Thou\nmust so run.",
        "The fourth direction: Beware of by-paths; take heed thou dost not turn\ninto those lanes which lead out of the way. There are crooked paths,\npaths in which men go astray, paths that lead to death and damnation,\nbut take heed of all those. Some of them are dangerous because of\npractise, some because of opinion, but mind them not; mind the path\nbefore thee, look right before thee, turn neither to the right hand\nnor to the left, but let thine eyes look right on, even right\nbefore thee; “Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be\nestablished.” Turn not to the right hand nor to the left. “Remove thy\nfoot far from evil.” This counsel being not so seriously taken as\ngiven, is the reason of that starting from opinion to opinion, reeling\nthis way and that way, out of this lane into that lane, and so missing\nthe way to the kingdom. Tho the way to heaven be but one, yet there\nare many crooked lanes and by-paths that shoot down upon it, as I may\nsay. And again, notwithstanding the kingdom of heaven be the biggest\ncity, yet usually those by-paths are most beaten, most travelers go\nthose ways; and therefore the way to heaven is hard to be found, and\nas hard to be kept in, by reason of these. Yet, nevertheless, it is in\nthis case as it was with the harlot of Jericho; she had one scarlet\nthread tied in her window, by which her house was known: so it is\nhere, the scarlet streams of Christ’s blood run throughout the way to\nthe kingdom of heaven; therefore mind that, see if thou do not find\nthe besprinkling of the blood of Christ in the way, and if thou do, be\nof good cheer, thou art in the right way; but have a care thou beguile\nnot thyself with a fancy; for then thou mayst light into any lane or\nway; but that thou mayst not be mistaken, consider, tho it seem never\nso pleasant, yet if thou do not find that in the very middle of the\nroad there is written with the heart-blood of Christ, that he came\ninto the world to save sinners, and that we are justified, tho we are\nungodly, shun that way; for this it is which the apostle meaneth when,\nhe saith, “We have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood\nof Jesus, by a new and living way which He hath consecrated for us,\nthrough the vail–that is to say, His flesh.” How easy a matter it is\nin this our day, for the devil to be too cunning for poor souls, by\ncalling his by-paths the way to the kingdom. If such an opinion or\nfancy be but cried up by one or more, this inscription being set upon\nit by the devil, “This is the way of God,” how speedily, greedily,\nand by heaps, do poor simple souls throw away themselves upon it;\nespecially if it be daubed over with a few external acts of morality,\nif so good. But it is because men do not know painted by-paths from\nthe plain way to the kingdom of heaven. They have not yet learned the\ntrue Christ, and what His righteousness is, neither have they a\nsense of their own insufficiency; but are bold, proud, presumptuous,\nself-conceited. And therefore,",
        "The fifth direction: Do not thou be too much in looking too high in\nthy journey heavenward. You know men that run a race do not use to\nstare and gaze this way and that, neither do they use to cast up their\neyes too high, lest haply, through their too much gazing with their\neyes after other things, they in the mean time stumble and catch a\nfall. The very same case is this: if thou gaze and stare after every\nopinion and way that comes into the world, also if thou be prying\novermuch into God’s secret decrees, or let thy heart too much\nentertain questions about some nice foolish curiosities, thou mayst\nstumble and fall, as many hundreds in England have done, both in\nranting and quakery, to their own eternal overthrow, without the\nmarvelous operation of God’s grace be suddenly stretched forth to\nbring them back again. Take heed, therefore; follow not that proud,\nlofty spirit, that, devil-like, can not be content with his own\nstation. David was of an excellent spirit, where he saith, “Lord,\nmy heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, neither do I exercise\nmyself in great matters, or things too high for me. Surely I have\nbehaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother: My\nsoul is even as a weaned child.” Do thou so run.",
        "The sixth direction: Take heed that you have not an ear open to every\none that calleth after you as you are in your journey. Men that run,\nyou know, if any do call after them, saying, I would speak with you,\nor go not too fast and you shall have my company with you, if they run\nfor some great matter, they use to say, Alas! I can not stay, I am\nin haste, pray talk not to me now; neither can I stay for you, I am\nrunning for a wager: if I win I am made; if I lose I am undone,\nand therefore hinder me not. Thus wise are men when they run for\ncorruptible things, and thus shouldst thou do, and thou hast more\ncause to do so than they, forasmuch as they run for things that last\nnot, but thou for an incorruptible glory. I give thee notice of this\nbetimes, knowing that thou shalt have enough call after thee, even the\ndevil, sin, this world, vain company, pleasures, profits, esteem among\nmen, ease, pomp, pride, together with an innumerable company of such\ncompanions; one crying, Stay for me; the other saying, Do not leave me\nbehind; a third saying, And take me along with you. What, will you go,\nsaith the devil, without your sins, pleasures, and profits? Are you so\nhasty? Can you not stay and take these along with you? Will you\nleave your friends and companions behind you? Can you not do as your\nneighbors do, carry the world, sin, lust, pleasure, profit, esteem\namong men, along with you? Have a care thou do not let thine ear open\nto the tempting, enticing, alluring, and soul-entangling flatteries\nof such sink-souls as these are. “My son,” saith Solomon, “if sinners\nentice thee, consent thou not.”",
        "You know what it cost the young man whom Solomon speaks of in the vii.\nof the Proverbs, that was enticed by a harlot: “With much fair speech\nshe won him, and caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips\nshe forced him, till he went after her as an ox to the slaughter, or\nas a fool to the correction of the stocks\"; even so far, “till the\ndart struck through his liver,” and he knew not “that it was for his\nlife.” “Hearken unto me now therefore,” saith he, “O ye children, and\nattend to the words of my mouth, let not thine heart incline to her\nways, go not astray in her paths, for she hast cast down many wounded,\nyea, many strong men have been slain (that is, kept out of heaven); by\nher house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.\"\nSoul, take this counsel, and say, Satan, sin, lust, pleasure, profit,\npride, friends, companions, and everything else, let me alone, stand\noff, come not nigh me, for I am running for heaven, for my soul, for\nGod, for Christ, from hell and everlasting damnation; if I win, I win\nall; and if I lose, I lose all; let me alone, for I will not hear. So\nrun.",
        "The seventh direction: In the next place be not daunted tho thou\nmeetest with never so many discouragements in thy journey thither.\nThat man that is resolved for heaven, if Satan can not win him by\nflatteries, he will endeavor to weaken him by discouragements; saying,\nThou art a sinner, thou hath broken God’s law, thou art not elected,\nthou cometh too late, the day of grace is passed, God doth not care\nfor thee, thy heart is naught, thou art lazy, with a hundred other\ndiscouraging suggestions. And thus it was with David where he saith,\n\"I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the loving-kindness of\nthe Lord in the land of the living.” As if he should say, the devil\ndid so rage, and my heart was so base, that had I judged according\nto my own sense and feeling, I had been absolutely distracted; but I\ntrusted to Christ in the promise, and looked that God would be as good\nas his promise, in having mercy upon me, an unworthy sinner; and this\nis that which encouraged me, and kept me from fainting. And thus must\nthou do when Satan or the law, or thy own conscience, do go about to\ndishearten thee, either by the greatness of thy sins, the wickedness\nof thy heart, the tediousness of the way, the loss of outward\nenjoyments, the hatred that thou wilt procure from the world or the\nlike; then thou must encourage thyself with the freeness of the\npromises, the tender-heartedness of Christ, the merits of His blood,\nthe freeness of His invitations to come in, the greatness of the sin\nof others that have been pardoned, and that the same God, through the\nsame Christ, holdeth forth the same grace as free as ever. If these be\nnot thy meditations, thou wilt draw very heavily in the way of heaven,\nif thou do not give up all for lost, and so knock off from following\nany farther; therefore, I say, take heart in thy journey, and say to\nthem that seek thy destruction, “Rejoice not against me, O my enemy,\nfor when I fall I shall arise, when I sit in darkness the Lord shall\nbe a light unto me.” So run.",
        "The eighth direction: Take heed of being offended at the cross that\nthou must go by before thou come to heaven. You must understand (as I\nhave already touched) that there is no man that goeth to heaven but he\nmust go by the cross. The cross is the standing way-mark by which all\nthey that go to glory must pass.",
        "“We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer\npersecution.” If thou art in thy way to the kingdom, my life for thine\nthou wilt come at the cross shortly (the Lord grant thou dost not\nshrink at it, so as to turn thee back again).",
        "“If any man will come after me,” saith Christ, “let him deny himself,\nand take up his cross daily, and follow me.” The cross it stands,\nand hath stood, from the beginning, as a way-mark to the kingdom of\nheaven. You know, if one ask you the way to such and such a place,\nyou, for the better direction, do not only say, This is the way, but\nthen also say, You must go by such a gate, by such a stile, such\na bush, tree, bridge, or such like. Why, so it is here; art thou\ninquiring the way to heaven? Why, I tell thee, Christ is the way; into\nHim thou must get, into His righteousness, to be justified; and if\nthou art in Him, thou wilt presently see the cross, thou must go close\nby it, thou must touch it, nay, thou must take it up, or else thou\nwilt quickly go out of the way that leads to heaven, and turn up some\nof those crooked lanes that lead down to the chambers of death.",
        "It is the cross which keepeth those that are kept from heaven. I am\npersuaded, were it not for the cross, where we have one professor we\nshould have twenty; but this cross, that is it which spoileth all.",
        "The ninth direction: Beg of God that He would do these two things for\nthee: First, enlighten thine understanding: And, secondly, inflame thy\nwill. If these two be but effectually done, there is no fear but thou\nwilt go safe to heaven.",
        "One of the great reasons why men and women do so little regard the\nother world is because they see so little of it: And the reason why\nthey see so little of it is because they have their understanding\ndarkened: And therefore, saith Paul, “Do not you believers walk as\ndo other Gentiles, even in the vanity of their minds, having their\nunderstanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through\nthe ignorance (or foolishness) that is in them, because of the\nblindness of their heart.” Walk not as those, run not with them: alas!\npoor souls, they have their understandings darkened, their hearts\nblinded, and that is the reason they have such undervaluing thoughts\nof the Lord Jesus Christ, and the salvation of their souls. For when\nmen do come to see the things of another world, what a God, what\na Christ, what a heaven, and what an eternal glory there is to be\nenjoyed; also when they see that it is possible for them to have a\nshare in it, I tell you it will make them run through thick and thin\nto enjoy it. Moses, having a sight of this, because his understanding\nwas enlightened, “He feared not the wrath of the king, but chose\nrather to suffer afflictions with the people of God than to enjoy the\npleasures of sin for a season. He refused to be called the son of\nthe king’s daughter\"; accounting it wonderful riches to be accounted\nworthy of so much as to suffer for Christ with the poor despised\nsaints; and that was because he saw Him who was invisible, and had\nrespect unto the recompense of reward. And this is that which the\napostle usually prayeth for in his epistles for the saints, namely,\n\"That they might know what is the hope of God’s calling, and the\nriches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints; and that they\nmight be able to comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth, and\nlength, and depth, and height, and know the love of Christ, which\npasseth knowledge.” ...",
        "The tenth direction: Cry to God that He would inflame thy will also\nwith the things of the other world. For when a man’s will is fully set\nto do such or such a thing, then it must be a very hard matter that\nshall hinder that man from bringing about his end. When Paul’s will\nwas set resolvedly to go up to Jerusalem (tho it was signified to him\nbefore what he should there suffer), he was not daunted at all; nay,\nsaith he, “I am ready (or willing) not only to be bound, but also\nto die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” His will was\ninflamed with love to Christ; and therefore all the persuasions that\ncould be used wrought nothing at all.",
        "Your self-willed people, nobody knows what to do with them: we use to\nsay, he will have his own will, do all what you can. Indeed, to have\nsuch a will for heaven, is an admirable advantage to a man that\nundertaketh a race thither; a man that is resolved, and hath his will\nfixt, saith he, I will do my best to advantage myself; I will do my\nworst to hinder my enemies; I will not give out as long as I can\nstand; I will have it or I will lose my life; “tho he slay me, yet\nwill I trust in him. I will not let thee go except thou bless me.” I\nwill, I will, I will, oh this blest inflamed will for heaven! What is\nit like? If a man be willing, then any argument shall be a matter\nof encouragement; but if unwilling, then any argument shall give\ndiscouragement; this is seen both in saints and sinners; in them that\nare the children of God, and also those that are the children of the\ndevil. As,",
        "1. The saints of old, they being willing and resolved for heaven,\nwhat could stop them? Could fire and fagot, sword or halter, stinking\ndungeons, whips, bears, bulls, lions, cruel rackings, stoning,\nstarving, nakedness, etc., “and in all these things they were more\nthan conquerors, through him that loved them\"; who had also made them\n\"willing in the day of his power.”",
        "2. See again, on the other side, the children of the devil, because\nthey are not willing, how many shifts and starting-holes they will\nhave. I have a married wife, I have a farm, I shall offend my\nlandlord, I shall offend my master, I shall lose my trading, I shall\nlose my pride, my pleasures, I shall be mocked and scoffed, therefore\nI dare not come. I, saith another, will stay till I am older, till my\nchildren are out, till I am got a little aforehand in the world, till\nI have done this and that and the other business; but, alas! the thing\nis, they are not willing; for, were they but soundly willing, these,\nand a thousand such as these, would hold them no faster than the cords\nheld Samson, when he broke them like burnt flax. I tell you the will\nis all: that is one of the chief things which turns the wheel either\nbackward or forward; and God knoweth that full well, and so likewise\ndoth the devil; and therefore they both endeavor very much to\nstrengthen the will of their servants; God, He is for making of His\na willing people to serve Him; and the devil, he doth what he can to\npossess the will and affection of those that are his with love to sin;\nand therefore when Christ comes closer to the matter, indeed, saith\nHe, “You will not come to me. How often would I have gathered you as a\nhen doth her chickens, but you would not.” The devil had possest their\nwills, and so long he was sure enough of them. Oh, therefore cry hard\nto God to inflame thy will for heaven and Christ: thy will, I say,\nif that be rightly set for heaven, thou wilt not be beat off with\ndiscouragements; and this was the reason that when Jacob wrestled with\nthe angel, tho he lost a limb, as it were, and the hollow of his thigh\nwas put out of joint as he wrestled with him, yet saith he, “I will\nnot,” mark, “I will not let thee go except thou bless me.” Get thy\nwill tipped with the heavenly grace, and resolution against all\ndiscouragements, and then thou goest full speed for heaven; but\nif thou falter in thy will, and be not found there, thou wilt run\nhobbling and halting all the way thou runnest, and also to be sure\nthou wilt fall short at last. The Lord give thee a will and courage.",
        "Thus I have done with directing thee how to run to the kingdom; be\nsure thou keep in memory what I have said unto thee, lest thou lose\nthy way. But because I would have thee think of them, take all in\nshort in this little bit of paper.",
        "1. Get into the way. 2. Then study on it. 3. Then, strip, and lay\naside everything that would hinder. 4.. Beware of by-paths. 5. Do not\ngaze and stare too much about thee, but be sure to ponder the path of\nthy feet. 6. Do not stop for any that call after thee, whether it be\nthe world, the flesh, or the devil: for all these will hinder thy\njourney, if possible. 7. Be not daunted with any discouragements thou\nmeetest with as thou goest. 8. Take heed of stumbling at the cross. 9.\nCry hard to God for an enlightened heart, and a willing mind, and God\ngive thee a prosperous journey.",
        "Provocation: Now that you may be provoked to run with the foremost,\ntake notice of this. When Lot and his wife were running from curst\nSodom to the mountains, to save their lives, it is said, that his wife\nlooked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt; and yet\nyou see that neither her example, nor the judgment of God that fell\nupon her for the same, would cause Lot to look behind him. I have\nsometimes wondered at Lot in this particular; his wife looked behind\nher, and died immediately, but let what would become of her, Lot would\nnot so much as once look behind him to see her. We do not read that he\ndid so much as once look where she was, or what was become of her; his\nheart was indeed upon his journey, and well it might: there was the\nmountain before him, and the fire and brimstone behind him; his life\nlay at stake, and he had lost it if he had looked behind. Do thou so\nrun and in thy race remember Lot’s wife, and remember her doom; and\nremember for what that doom did overtake her; and remember that God\nmade her an example for all lazy runners, to the end of the world; and\ntake heed thou fall not after the same example. But,",
        "If this will not provoke thee, consider thus, 1. Thy soul is thine own\nsoul, that is either to be saved or lost; thou shalt not lose my soul\nby thy laziness. It is thine own soul, thine own ease, thine own\npeace, thine own advantage or disadvantage. If it were my own that\nthou art desired to be good unto, methinks reason should move thee\nsomewhat to pity it. But, alas! it is thine own, thine own soul. “What\nshall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his\nown soul?” God’s people wish well to the souls of others, and wilt not\nthou wish well to thine own? And if this will not provoke thee, then\nthink.",
        "Again, 2. If thou lose thy soul, it is thou also that must bear the\nblame. It made Cain stark mad to consider that he had not looked to\nhis brother Abel’s soul. How much more will it perplex thee to think\nthat thou hadst not a care of thine own? And if this will not provoke\nthee to bestir thyself, think again.",
        "3. That, if thou wilt not run, the people of God are resolved to deal\nwith thee even as Lot dealt with his wife–that is, leave thee behind\nthem. It may be thou hast a father, mother, brother, etc., going\npost-haste to heaven, wouldst thou be willing to be left behind them?\nSurely no.",
        "Again, 4. Will it not be a dishonor to thee to see the very boys and\ngirls in the country to have more with them than thyself? It may be\nthe servants of some men, as the housekeeper, plowman, scullion, etc.,\nare more looking after heaven than their masters. I am apt to think,\nsometimes, that more servants than masters, that more tenants than\nlandlords, will inherit the kingdom of heaven. But is not this a shame\nfor them that are such? I am persuaded you scorn that your servants\nshould say that they are wiser than you in the things of this world;\nand yet I am bold to say that many of them are wiser than you in the\nthings of the world to come, which are of greater concernment.",
        "Expostulation. Well, then, sinner, what sayest thou? Where is thy\nheart? Wilt thou run? Art thou resolved to strip? Or art thou not?\nThink quickly, man; have no dallying in this matter.

If thou dost not know the\nway, inquire at the Word of God; if thou wantest company, cry for\nGod’s Spirit; if thou wantest encouragement, entertain the promises.\nBut be sure thou begin betimes; get into the way, run apace, and hold\nout to the end; and the Lord give thee a prosperous journey.

        "THE REASONABLENESS OF A RESURRECTION",
        "John Tillotson, archbishop of Canterbury, renowned as a preacher,\nwas born at Sowerby, in Yorkshire, in 1630, the son of an ardent\nIndependent. After graduating from Clare College, Cambridge, he began\nto preach in 1661, in connection with the Presbyterian wing of the\nChurch of England. He, however, submitted to the Act of Uniformity\nthe following year, and in 1663 was inducted into the rectory of\nVeddington, Suffolk. He was also appointed preacher to Lincoln’s Inn,\nwas made prebendary of Canterbury in 1670 and dean in 1672. William\nIII regarded him with high favor, and he succeeded the nonjuring\nSancroft in the arch-see of Canterbury. His sermons are characterized\nby stateliness, copiousness and lucidity, and were long looked upon as\nmodels of correct pulpit style. He died in 1694.",

        "THE REASONABLENESS OF A RESURRECTION",
        "Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should\nraise the dead?–Acts xxvi., 8.",
        "The resurrection of the dead is one of the great articles of the\nChristian faith; and yet so it hath happened that this great article\nof our religion hath been made one of the chief objections against\nit. There is nothing that Christianity hath been more upbraided for\nwithal, both by the heathens of old and by the infidels of later\ntimes, than the impossibility of this article; so that it is a matter\nof great consideration and consequence to vindicate our religion in\nthis particular. But if the thing be evidently impossible, then it is\nhighly unreasonable to propose it to the belief of mankind.",
        "I know that some, more devout than wise, and who, it is to be hoped,\nmean better than they understand, make nothing of impossibilities in\nmatters of faith, and would fain persuade us that the more impossible\nanything is, for that very reason it is the fitter to be believed; and\nthat it is an argument of a poor and low faith to believe only things\nthat are possible; but a generous and heroical faith will swallow\ncontradictions with as much ease as reason assents to the plainest and\nmost evident propositions. Tertullian, in the heat of his zeal and\neloquence, upon this point of the death and resurrection of Christ,\nlets fall a very odd passage, and which must have many grains of\nallowance to make it tolerable: ’prosus credible est (saith he),\nquia ineptum est; certum est, quia impossible–it is therefore\nvery credible, because it is foolish, and certain, because it is\nimpossible\"; “and this (says he) is necessarium dedecus fidei,” that\nis, “it is necessary the Christian faith should be thus disgraced by\nthe belief of impossibilities and contradictions.” I suppose he means\nthat this article of the resurrection was not in itself the less\ncredible because the heathen philosophers caviled at it as a thing\nimpossible and contradictious, and endeavored to disgrace the\nChristian religion upon that account. For if he meant otherwise, that\nthe thing was therefore credible because it was really and in itself\nfoolish and impossible; this had been to recommend the Christian\nreligion from the absurdity of the things to be believed; which\nwould be a strange recommendation of any religion to the sober and\nreasonable part of mankind.",
        "I know not what some men may find in themselves; but I must freely\nacknowledge that I could never yet attain to that bold and hardy\ndegree of faith as to believe anything for this reason, because it was\nimpossible: for this would be to believe a thing to be because I am\nsure it can not be. So that I am very far from being of his mind, that\nwanted not only more difficulties, but even impossibilities in the\nChristian religion, to exercise his faith upon.",
        "Leaving to the Church of Rome that foolhardiness of faith, to believe\nthings to be true which at the same time their reason plainly tells\nthem are impossible, I shall at this time endeavor to assert and\nvindicate this article of the resurrection from the pretended\nimpossibility of it. And I hope, by God’s assistance, to make the\npossibility of the thing so plain as to leave no considerable scruple\nabout it in any free and unprejudiced mind. And this I shall do from\nthese words of St. Paul, which are part of the defense which he made\nfor himself before Festus and Agrippa, the substance whereof is this,\nthat he had lived a blameless and inoffensive life among the Jews, in\nwhose religion he had been bred up; that he was of the strictest sect\nof that religion, a Pharisee, which, in opposition to the Sadducees,\nmaintained the resurrection of the dead and a future state of rewards\nand punishments in another life; and that for the hope of this he was\ncalled in question, and accused by the Jews. “And now I stand here,\nand am judged, for the hope of the promise made unto the fathers; unto\nwhich promise our twelve scribes, instantly serving God day and night,\nhope to come; for which hope’s sake, King Agrippa, I am accused of the\nJews.” That is, he was accused for preaching that Jesus was risen from\nthe dead, which is a particular instance of the general doctrine of\nthe resurrection which was entertained by the greatest part of the\nJews, and which to the natural reason of mankind (however the heathen\nin opposition to the Christian religion were prejudiced against it),\nhath nothing in it that is incredible. And for this he appeals to\nhis judges, Festus and Agrippa: “why should it be thought a thing\nincredible with you that God should raise the dead?”",
        "Which words being a question without an answer, imply in them these\ntwo propositions:",
        "First, That it was thought by some a thing incredible that the dead\nshould be raised. This is supposed in the question, as the foundation\nof it: for he who asks why a thing is so, supposeth it to be so.",
        "Secondly, That this apprehension, that it is a thing incredible that\nGod should raise the dead, is very unreasonable. For the question\nbeing left unanswered, implies its own answer, and is to be resolved\ninto this affirmative, that there is no reason why they or any man\nelse should think it a thing incredible that God should raise the\ndead.",
        "I shall speak to these two propositions as briefly as I can; and then\nshow what influence this doctrine of the resurrection ought to have\nupon our lives.",
        "First, that it was thought by some a thing incredible that God should\nraise the dead. This St. Paul has reason to suppose, having from his\nown experience found men so averse from the entertaining of this\ndoctrine. When he preached to the philosophers at Athens, and declared\nto them the resurrection of one Jesus from the dead, they were amazed\nat this new doctrine, and knew not what he meant by it. They said, “he\nseemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods, because he preached unto\nthem Jesus and the resurrection.” He had discoursed to them of the\nresurrection of one Jesus from the dead; but this business of the\nresurrection of one Jesus from the dead was a thing so remote from\ntheir apprehensions that they had no manner of conception of it; but\nunderstood him quite in another sense, as if he had declared to them\ntwo new deities, Jesus and Anastasis; as if he had brought a new god\nand a new goddess among them, Jesus and the Resurrection. And when he\ndiscoursed to them again more fully of this matter, it is said that,\n\"when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, they mocked.” And at\nthe twenty-fourth verse of this twenty-sixth chapter, when he spake of\nthe resurrection, Festus told him he would hear him no further, and\nthat he looked upon him as a man beside himself, whom much learning\nhad made mad. Festus looked upon this business of the resurrection\nas the wild speculation of a crazy head. And indeed the heathens\ngenerally, even those who believed the immortality of the soul, and\nanother state after this life, looked upon the resurrection of the\nbody as a thing impossible. Pliny, I remember, reckons it among\nthose things which are impossible, and which God himself can not do;\n\"_revocare defunctos, to call back the dead to life\"; and in the\nprimitive times the heathen philosophers very much derided the\nChristians, upon account of this strange doctrine of the resurrection,\nlooking always upon this article of their faith as a ridiculous and\nimpossible assertion.",
        "So easy it is for prejudice to blind the minds of men, and to\nrepresent everything to them which hath a great appearance of\ndifficulty in it as impossible. But I shall endeavor to show that if\nthe matter be thoroughly examined, there is no ground for any such\napprehension.",
        "I proceed therefore to the second proposition, namely, that this\napprehension, that it is an incredible thing that God should raise\nthe dead, is very unreasonable: “why should it be thought a thing\nincredible with you, that God should raise the dead?” That is, there\nis no sufficient reason why any man should look upon the resurrection\nof the dead as a thing impossible to the power of God; the only\nreason why they thought it incredible being because they judged it\nimpossible; so that nothing can be vainer than for men to pretend to\nbelieve the resurrection; and yet at the same time to grant it to be a\nthing in reason impossible, because no man can believe that which he\nthinks to be incredible; and the impossibility of a thing is the best\nreason any man can have to think a thing incredible. So that the\nmeaning of St. Paul’s question is, “why should it be thought a thing\nimpossible that God should raise the dead?”",
        "To come then to the business: I shall endeavor to show that there is\nno sufficient reason why men should look upon the resurrection of the\ndead as a thing impossible to God. “Why should it be thought a thing\nincredible (that is, impossible) with you, that God should raise the\ndead?” which question implies in it these three things:",
        "1. That it is above the power of nature to raise the dead.",
        "2. But it is not above the power of God to raise the dead.",
        "3. That God should be able to do this is by no means incredible to\nnatural reason.",
        "First. This question implies that it is above the power of nature\nto raise the dead; and therefore the apostle puts the question very\ncautiously, “why should it be thought incredible that God should raise\nthe dead?” by which he seems to grant that it is impossible to any\nnatural power to raise the dead; which is granted on all hands.",
        "Secondly. But this question does plainly imply that it is not above\nthe power of God to do this. Tho the raising of the dead to life be\na thing above the power of nature, yet why should it be thought\nincredible that God, who is the author of nature, should be able to\ndo this? and indeed the apostle’s putting the question in this manner\ntakes away the main ground of the objection against the resurrection\nfrom the impossibility of the thing. For the main reason why it was\nlooked upon as impossible was, because it was contrary to the course\nof nature that there should be any return from a perfect privation to\na habit, and that a body perfectly dead should be restored to life\nagain: but for all this no man that believes in a God who made the\nworld, and this natural frame of things, but must think it very\nreasonable to believe that He can do things far above the power of\nanything that He hath made.",
        "Thirdly. This question implies that it is not a thing incredible to\nnatural reason that God should be able to raise the dead. I do not say\nthat by natural light we can discover that God will raise the dead;\nfor that, depending merely upon the will of God, can no otherwise be\ncertainly known than by divine revelation: but that God can do this\nis not at all incredible to natural reason. And this is sufficiently\nimplied in the question which St. Paul asks, in which he appeals to\nFestus and Agrippa, neither of them Christians, “why should it be\nthought a thing incredible with you that God should raise the dead?\"\nAnd why should he appeal to them concerning the credibility of this\nmatter if it be a thing incredible to natural reason?",
        "That it is not, I shall first endeavor to prove, and then to answer\nthe chief objections against the possibility of it.",
        "And I prove it thus: it is not incredible to natural reason that God\nmade the world, and all the creatures in it; that mankind is His\noffspring; and that He gives us life and breath, and all things. This\nwas acknowledged and firmly believed by many of the heathens. And\nindeed, whoever believes that the being of God may be known by natural\nlight, must grant that it may be known by the natural light of reason\nthat God made the world; because one of the chief arguments of the\nbeing of God is taken from those visible effects of wisdom, and power,\nand goodness, which we see in the frame of the world. Now He that can\ndo the greater can undoubtedly do the less; He that made all things of\nnothing, can much more raise a body out of dust; He who at first gave\nlife to so many inanimate beings, can easily restore that which is\ndead to life again. It is an excellent saying of one of the Jewish\nrabbis: He who made that which was not, to be, can certainly make that\nwhich was once, to be again. This hath the force of a demonstration;\nfor no man that believes that God hath done the one, can make any\ndoubt but that He can, if He please, do the other.",
        "This seems to be so very clear, that they must be strong objections\nindeed, that can render it incredible.",
        "There are but two that I know of, that are of any consideration, and\nI shall not be afraid to represent them to you with their utmost\nadvantage; and they are these:",
        "First, against the resurrection in general: it is pretended\nimpossible, after the bodies of men are resolved into dust, to\nre-collect all the dispersed parts and bring them together, to be\nunited into one body.",
        "The second is leveled against a resurrection in some particular\ninstances, and pretends it to be impossible in some cases only–viz.,\nwhen that which was the matter of one man’s body does afterward become\nthe matter of another man’s body; in which case, say they, it is\nimpossible that both these should, at the resurrection, each have his\nown body.",
        "The difficulty of both these objections is perfectly avoided by those\nwho hold that it is not necessary that our bodies at the resurrection\nshould consist of the very same parts of matter that they did before.\nThere being no such great difference between one parcel of dust and\nanother; neither in respect of the power of God, which can easily\ncommand this parcel of dust as that to become a living body and being\nunited to a living soul to rise up and walk; so that the miracle of\nthe resurrection will be all one in the main, whether our bodies be\nmade of the very same matter they were before, or not; nor will there\nbe any difference as to us; for whatever matter our bodies be made of,\nwhen they are once reunited to our souls, they will be then as much\nour own as if they had been made of the very same matter of which they\nconsisted before. Besides that, the change which the resurrection will\nmake in our bodies will be so great that we could not know them to be\nthe same, tho they were so.",
        "Now upon this supposition, which seems philosophical enough, the force\nof both these objections is wholly declined. But there is no need to\nfly to this refuge; and therefore I will take this article of the\nresurrection in the strictest sense for the raising of a body to life,\nconsisting of the same individual matter that it did before; and in\nthis sense, I think, it has generally been received by Christians, not\nwithout ground, from Scripture. I will only mention one text, which\nseems very strongly to imply it: “and the sea gave up the dead which\nwere in it; and death and the grave delivered up the dead which, were\nin them; and they were judged every man according to his works.” Now\nwhy should the sea and the grave be said to deliver up their dead, if\nthere were not a resurrection of the same body; for any dust formed\ninto a living body and united to the soul, would serve the turn? We\nwill therefore take it for granted that the very same body will\nbe raised, and I doubt not, even in this sense, to vindicate the\npossibility of the resurrection from both these objections.",
        "First, against the resurrection in general of the same body; it is\npretended impossible, after the bodies of men are moldered into dust,\nand by infinite accidents have been scattered up and down the world,\nand have undergone a thousand changes, to re-collect and rally\ntogether the very same parts of which they consisted before. This the\nheathens used to object to the primitive Christians; for which reason\nthey also used to burn the bodies of the martyrs, and to scatter their\nashes in the air, to be blown about by the wind, in derision of their\nhopes of a resurrection.",
        "I know not how strong malice might make this objection to appear; but\nsurely in reason it is very weak; for it wholly depends upon a gross\nmistake of the nature of God and his providence, as if it did not\nextend to the smallest things; as if God did not know all things that\nHe hath made, and had them not always in His view, and perfectly\nunder His command; and as if it were a trouble and burden to infinite\nknowledge and power to understand and order the least things; whereas\ninfinite knowledge and power can know and manage all things with as\nmuch ease as we can understand and order any one thing; so that this\nobjection is grounded upon a low and false apprehension of the Divine\nnature, and is only fit for Epicurus and his herd, who fancied to\nthemselves a sort of slothful and unthinking deities, whose happiness\nconsisted in their laziness, and a privilege to do nothing.",
        "I proceed therefore to the second objection, which is more close\nand pressing; and this is leveled against the resurrection in some\nparticular instances. I will mention but two, by which all the rest\nmay be measured and answered.",
        "One is, of those who are drowned in the sea, and their bodies eaten up\nby fishes, and turned into their nourishment: and those fishes perhaps\neaten afterward by men, and converted into the substance of their\nbodies.",
        "The other is of the cannibals; some of whom, as credible relations\ntell us, have lived wholly or chiefly on the flesh of men; and\nconsequently the whole, or the greater part of the substance of their\nbodies is made of the bodies of other men. In these and the like\ncases, wherein one man’s body is supposed to be turned into the\nsubstance of another man’s body, how should both these at the\nresurrection each recover his own body? So that this objection is like\nthat of the Sadducees to our Savior, concerning a woman that had seven\nhusbands: they ask, “whose wife of the seven shall she be at the\nresurrection?” So here, when several have had the same body, whose\nshall it be at the resurrection? and how shall they be supplied that\nhave it not?",
        "This is the objection; and in order to the answering of it, I shall\npremise these two things:",
        "1. That the body of man is not a constant and permanent thing, always\ncontinuing in the same state, and consisting of the same matter; but\na successive thing, which is continually spending and continually\nrenewing itself, every day losing something of the matter which it had\nbefore, and gaining new; so that most men have new bodies oftener than\nthey have new clothes; only with this difference, that we change our\nclothes commonly at once, but our bodies by degrees.",
        "And this is undeniably certain from experience. For so much as our\nbodies grow, so much new matter is added to them, over and beside the\nrepairing of what is continually spent; and after a man come to his\nfull growth, so much of his food as every day turns into nourishment,\nso much of his yesterday’s body is usually wasted, and carried off by\ninsensible perspiration–that is, breathed out at the pores of his\nbody; which, according to the static experiment of Sanctorius, a\nlearned physician, who, for several years together, weighed himself\nexactly every day, is (as I remember) according to the proportion of\nfive to eight of all that a man eats and drinks. Now, according to\nthis proportion, every man must change his body several times in a\nyear.",
        "It is true indeed the more solid parts of the body, as the bones, do\nnot change so often as the fluid and fleshy; but that they also do\nchange is certain, because they grow, and whatever grows is nourished\nand spends, because otherwise it would not need to be repaired.",
        "2. The body which a man hath at any time of his life is as much his\nown body as that which he hath at his death; so that if the very\nmatter of his body which a man had at any time of his life be raised,\nit is as much his own and the same body as that which he had at\nhis death, and commonly much more perfect; because they who die of\nlingering sickness or old age are usually mere skeletons when they\ndie; so that there is no reason to suppose that the very matter of\nwhich our bodies consists at the time of our death shall be that which\nshall be raised, that being commonly the worst and most imperfect body\nof all the rest.",
        "These two things being premised, the answer to this objection can not\nbe difficult. For as to the more solid and firm parts of the body, as\nthe skull and bones, it is not, I think, pretended that the cannibals\neat them; and if they did, so much of the matter even of these solid\nparts wastes away in a few years, as being collected together would\nsupply them many times over. And as for the fleshy and fluid parts,\nthese are so very often changed and renewed that we can allow the\ncannibals to eat them all up, and to turn them all into nourishment,\nand yet no man need contend for want of a body of his own at the\nresurrection–viz., any of those bodies which he had ten or twenty\nyears before; which are every whit as good and as much his own as that\nwhich was eaten.",
        "Having thus shown that the resurrection is not a thing incredible to\nnatural reason, I should now proceed to show the certainty of it from\ndivine revelation. For as reason tells us it is not impossible, so the\nword of God hath assured us that it is certain. The texts of Scripture\nare so many and clear to this purpose, and so well known to all\nChristians, that I will produce none. I shall only tell you that as\nit is expressly revealed in the gospel, so our blest Savior, for the\nconfirmation of our faith and the comfort and encouragement of our\nhope, hath given us the experiment of it in his own resurrection,\nwhich is “the earnest and first-fruits of ours.” So St. Paul tells us\nthat “Christ is risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of\nthem that slept” And that Christ did really rise from the dead, we\nhave as good evidence as for any ancient matter of fact which we do\nmost firmly believe; and more and greater evidence than this the thing\nis not capable of; and because it is not, no reasonable man ought to\nrequire it.",
        "Now what remains but to conclude this discourse with those practical\ninferences which our apostle makes from this doctrine of the\nresurrection; and I shall mention these two:",
        "The first for our support and comfort under the infirmities and\nmiseries of this mortal life.",
        "The second for the encouragement of obedience and a good life.",
        "1. For our comfort and support under the infirmities and miseries of\nthis mortal state. The consideration of the glorious change of our\nbodies at the resurrection of the just can not but be a great comfort\nto us, under all bodily pain and sufferings.",
        "One of the greatest burdens of human nature is the frailty and\ninfirmity of our bodies, the necessities they are frequently prest\nwithal, the manifold diseases they are liable to, and the dangers and\nterrors of death, to which they are continually subject and enslaved.\nBut the time is coming, if we be careful to prepare ourselves for it,\nwhen we shall be clothed with other kind of bodies, free from all the\nmiseries and inconveniences which flesh and blood is subject to.\nFor “these vile bodies shall be changed, and fashioned like to the\nglorious body of the Son of God.” When our bodies shall be raised to a\nnew life, they shall become incorruptible; “for this corruptible shall\nput on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality; and\nthen shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is\nswallowed up in victory.” When this last enemy is conquered, there\nshall be no “fleshly lusts” nor brutish passions “to fight against the\nsoul; no law in our members to war against the laws of our minds\"; no\ndisease to torment us; no danger of death to amaze and terrify us.\nThen all the passions and appetites of our outward man shall be\nsubject to the reason of our minds, and our bodies shall partake of\nthe immortality of our souls. It is but a very little while that our\nspirits shall be crusht and clogged with these heavy and sluggish\nbodies; at the resurrection they shall be refined from all dregs of\ncorruption, and become spiritual, and incorruptible, and glorious, and\nevery way suited to the activity and perfection of a glorified soul\nand the “spirits of just men made perfect.”",
        "2. For the encouragement of obedience and a good life. Let the belief\nof this great article of our faith have the same influence upon us\nwhich St. Paul tells it had upon him. “I have hope toward God that\nthere shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and\nunjust; and herein do I exercise myself always to have a conscience\nvoid of offense toward God and toward man.” The firm belief of a\nresurrection to another life should make every one of us very careful\nhow we demean ourselves in this life, and afraid to do anything or to\nneglect anything that may defeat our hopes of a blest immortality,\nand expose us to the extreme and endless misery of body and soul in\nanother life.",
        "Particularly, it should be an argument to us, “to glorify God in our\nbodies and in our spirits\"; and to use the members of the one and\nthe faculties of the other as “instruments of righteousness unto\nholiness.” We should reverence ourselves, and take heed not only how\nwe defile our souls by sinful passions, but how we dishonor our bodies\nby sensual and brutish lusts; since God hath designed so great an\nhonor and happiness for both at the resurrection.",
        "So often as we think of a blest resurrection to eternal life, and the\nhappy consequences of it, the thought of so glorious a reward should\nmake us diligent and unwearied in the service of so good a Master and\nso great a Prince, who can and will prefer us to infinitely greater\nhonors than any that are to be had in this world. This inference the\napostle makes from the doctrine of the resurrection. “Therefore, my\nbeloved brethren, be ye steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the\nwork of the Lord; for as much as ye know that your labor is not in\nvain in the Lord.”",
        "Nay, we may begin this blest state while we are upon earth, by\n\"setting our hearts and affections upon the things that are above,\nand having our conversation in heaven, from whence also we look for a\nSavior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile bodies, that\nthey may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the\nworking whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.”",
        "“Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus\nChrist, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the\neverlasting covenant, make us perfect in every good work to do his\nwill, working in us always that which is pleasing in his sight,\nthrough Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever. Amen.”",
        "THE REDEEMER’S TEARS OVER LOST SOULS",
        "John Howe, a leading writer and divine under the Commonwealth, was\nborn in 1630, at Loughborough, in Leicestershire, England. He was\neducated at Cambridge and Oxford, and ordained by Charles Herle,\nrector of Winwick, whom he styled, “a primitive bishop.” He became\nchaplain to Cromwell and his son Richard. Among his contributions to\nPuritan theology are “The Good Man the Living Temple of God,” and\n\"Vanity of Men as Mortal,” He was a man of intellect and imagination.\nHis sermons, tho often long and cumbersome, are marked by warmth of\nfancy and a sublimity of spirit superior to his style. Howe was a\nleading spirit in the effort made for the union of the Congregational\nand Presbyterian bodies. He died in 1705.",
        "1630-1705",
        "THE REDEEMER’S TEARS OVER LOST SOULS",
        "And when He was come near, He beheld the city, and wept over it,\nsaying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the\nthings which belong to thy peace! But now they are hid from thine\neyes.–Luke six., 41, 42.",
        "Such as live tinder the gospel have a day, or a present opportunity,\nfor the obtaining the knowledge of those things immediately belonging\nto their peace, and of whatsoever is besides necessary thereunto. I\nsay nothing what opportunities they have who never lived under the\ngospel, who yet no doubt might generally know more than they do, and\nknow better what they do know. It suffices who enjoy the gospel to\nunderstand our own advantages thereby. Nor, as to those who do enjoy\nit, is every one’s day of equal clearness. How few, in comparison,\nhave ever seen such a day as Jerusalem at this time did I made by\nthe immediate beams of the Sun of Righteousness! our Lord Himself\nvouchsafing to be their Instructor, so speaking as never man did, and\nwith such authority as far outdid their other teachers, and astonished\nthe hearers. In what transports did He use to leave those that heard\nHim, wheresoever He came, wondering at the gracious words that came\nout of His mouth! And with what mighty and beneficial works was He\nwent to recommend His doctrine, shining in the glorious power and\nsavoring of the abundant mercy of Heaven, so that every apprehensive\nmind might see the Deity was incarnate. God was come down to entreat\nwith men, and allure them into the knowledge and love of Himself. The\nWord was made flesh. What unprejudiced mind might not perceive it to\nbe so? He was there manifested and vailed at once; both expressions\nare made concerning the same matter. The divine beams were somewhat\nobscured, but did yet ray through that vail; so that His glory was\nbeheld of the only-begotten Son of His Father, full of grace and\ntruth.",
        "This Sun shone with a mild and benign, but with a powerful, vivifying\nlight. In Him was life, and that life was the light of men. Such a\nlight created unto the Jews this their day. Happy Jews, if they had\nunderstood their own happiness! And the days that followed to them\n(for a while) and the Gentile world were not inferior, in some\nrespects brighter and more glorious (the more copious gift of the\nHoly Ghost being reserved unto the crowning and enthroning of the\nvictorious Redeemer), when the everlasting gospel flew like lightning\nto the uttermost ends of the earth, and the word which began to be\nspoken by the Lord Himself was confirmed by them that heard Him, God\nalso Himself bearing them witness with signs, and wonders, and gifts\nof the Holy Ghost. No such day hath been seen this many an age. Yet\nwhithersoever this same gospel, for substance, comes, it also makes a\nday of the same kind, and affords always true tho diminished light,\nwhereby, however, the things of our peace might be understood and\nknown. The written gospel varies not, and if it be but simply and\nplainly proposed tho to some it be proposed with more advantage, to\nsome with less, still we have the same things immediately relating to\nour peace extant before our eyes ...",
        "This day hath its bounds and limits, so that when it is over and lost\nwith such, the things of their peace are forever hid from their eyes.\nAnd that this day is not infinite and endless, we see in the present\ninstance. Jerusalem had her day; but that day had its period, we see\nit comes to this at last, that now the things of her peace are hid\nfrom her eyes. We generally see the same thing, in that sinners are so\nearnestly prest to make use of the present time. To-day if you will\nhear His voice, harden not your hearts. They are admonished to seek\nthe Lord while He may be found, to call upon Him when He is nigh. It\nseems some time He will not be found, and will be far off. They are\ntold this is the accepted time, this is the day of salvation ... As it\nis certain death ends the day of grace with every unconverted person,\nsoit is very possible that it may end with divers before they die; by\ntheir total loss of all external means, or by the departure of the\nblest Spirit of God from them; so as to return and visit them no more.",
        "How the day of grace may end with a person, is to be understood by\nconsidering what it is that makes up and constitutes such a day. There\nmust become measure and proportion of time to make up this (or any)\nday, which is as the substratum and ground fore-laid. Then there must\nbe light superadded, otherwise it differs not from night, which may\nhave the same measure of mere time. The gospel revelation some way or\nother, must be had, as being the light of such a day. And again there\nmust be some degree of liveliness, and vital influence, the more usual\nconcomitant of light; the night doth more dispose men to drowsiness.\nThe same sun that enlightens the world disseminates also an\ninvigorating influence. If the Spirit of the living God do no way\nanimate the gospel revelation, and breathe in it, we have no day of\ngrace. It is not only a day of light, but a day of power, wherein\nsouls can be wrought upon, and a people made willing to become the\nLord’s. As the Redeemer revealed in the gospel, is the light of the\nworld, so He is life to it too, tho neither are planted or do take\nroot everywhere. In Him was life and that life was the light of men.\nThat light that rays from Him is vital light in itself, and in its\ntendency and design, tho it be disliked and not entertained by the\nmost. Whereas therefore these things must concur to make up such a\nday; if either a man’s time, his life on earth, expire, or if light\nquite fail him, or if all gracious influence be withheld, so as to be\ncommunicated no more, his day is done, the season of grace is over\nwith him. Now it is plain that many a one may lose the gospel before\nhis life end; and possible that all gracious influence may be\nrestrained, while as yet the external dispensation of the gospel\nremains. A sinner may have hardened his heart to that degree that God\nwill attempt him no more, in any kind, with any design of kindness to\nhim, not in that more inward, immediate way at all–i.e., by the\nmotions of His Spirit, which peculiarly can impart nothing but\nfriendly inclination, as whereby men are personally applied unto,\nso that can not be meant; nor by the voice of the gospel, which may\neither be continued for the sake of others, or they contained under\nit, but for their heavier doom at length. Which, tho it may seem\nsevere, is not to be thought strange, much less unrighteous.",
        "It is not to be thought strange to them that read the Bible, which so\noften speaks this sense; as when it warns and threatens men with so\nmuch terror. For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the\nknowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,\nbut a fearful looking for judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall\ndevour the adversaries. He that despised Moses’s law died without\nmercy, under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment,\nsuppose ye, shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the\nSon of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith He\nwas sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit\nof grace? And when It tells us, after many overtures made to men in\nvain, of His having given them up. “But my people would not hearken to\nmy voice; and Israel would none of me; so I gave them up unto their\nown hearts’ lust: and they walked in their own counsels;” and\npronounces, “Let him that is unjust be unjust still, and let him which\nis filthy be filthy still,” and says, “In thy filthiness is lewdness,\nbecause I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged; thou shalt not\nbe purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to\nrest upon thee.” Which passages seem to imply a total desertion of\nthem, and retraction of all gracious influence. And when it speaks of\nletting them be under the gospel, and the ordinary means of salvation,\nfor the most direful purpose: as that, “This child (Jesus) was set\nfor the fall, as well as for the rising, of many in Israel\"; as that,\n\"Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling, and a rock of offense\"; and, “The\nstone which the builders refused, is made a stone of stumbling, and\na rock of offense, even to them which, stumble at the word, being\ndisobedient, whereunto also they were appointed\"; with that of our\nSavior Himself, “For judgment I am come into this world, that they\nwhich see not might see; and that they which see, might be made\nblind.” And most agreeable to those former places is that of the\nprophet, “But the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept,\nline upon line, here a little and there a little; that they might go,\nand fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.” And we may\nadd, that our God hath put us out of doubt that there is such a sin as\nthat which is eminently called the sin against the Holy Ghost; that\na man in such circumstances, and to such a degree, sin against that\nSpirit, that He will never move or breathe upon him more, but leave\nhim to a hopeless ruin; tho I shall not in this discourse determine\nor discuss the nature of it. But I doubt not it is somewhat else than\nfinal impenitency and infidelity; and that every one that dies, not\nhaving sincerely repented and believed, is not guilty of it, tho every\none that is guilty of it dies impenitent and unbelieving, but was\nguilty of it before; so it is not the mere want of time that makes\nhim guilty. Whereupon, therefore, that such may outlive their day of\ngrace, is out of the question ...",
        "Wherefore, no man can certainly know, or ought to conclude, concerning\nhimself or others, as long as they live, that the season of grace\nis quite over with them. As we can conceive no rule God hath set to\nHimself to proceed by, in ordinary cases of this nature; so nor is\nthere any He hath set unto us to judge by, in this case. It were to no\npurpose, and could be of no use to men to know so much; therefore it\nwere unreasonable to expect God should have settled and declared any\nrule, by which they might come to the knowledge of it. As the case is\nthen, viz.: there being no such rule, no such thing can be concluded;\nfor who can tell what an arbitrary, sovereign, free agent will do, if\nhe declare not his own purpose himself? How should it be known, when\nthe Spirit of God hath been often working upon the soul of man, that\nthis or that shall be the last act, and that he will never put forth\nanother? And why should God make it known? To the person himself whose\ncase it is, ’tis manifest it could be of no benefit. Nor is it to\nbe thought the Holy God will ever so alter the course of His own\nproceedings but that it shall be finally seen to all the world that\nevery man’s destruction was entirely, and to the last, of himself. If\nGod had made it evident to a man that he were finally rejected, he\nwere obliged to believe it. But shall it ever be said, God hath made\nanything a man’s duty which were inconsistent with his felicity. The\nhaving sinned himself into such a condition wherein he is forsaken\nof God is indeed inconsistent with it. And so the case is to\nstand–i.e., that his perdition be in immediate connection with\nhis sin, not with his duty; as it would be in immediate, necessary\nconnection with his duty, if he were bound to believe himself finally\nforsaken and a lost creature. For that belief makes him hopeless, and\na very devil, justifies his unbelief in the gospel, toward himself, by\nremoving and shutting up, toward himself, the object of such a faith,\nand consequently brings the matter to this state that he perishes, not\nbecause he doth not believe God reconcilable to man, but because, with\nparticular application to himself, he ought not so to believe. And it\nwere most unfit, and of very pernicious consequence, that such a thing\nshould be generally known concerning others....",
        "But tho none ought to conclude that their day or season of grace is\nquite expired, yet they ought to deeply apprehend the danger, lest\nit should expire before their necessary work be done and their peace\nmade. For tho it can be of no use for them to know the former, and\ntherefore they have no means appointed them by which to know it, ’tis\nof great use to apprehend the latter; and they have sufficient ground\nfor the apprehension. All the cautions and warnings wherewith the Holy\nSpirit abounds, of the kind with those already mentioned, have that\nmanifest design. And nothing can be more important, or opposite to\nthis purpose, than that solemn charge of the great apostle: “Work out\nyour own salvation with fear and trembling\"; considered together with\nthe subjoined ground of it; “For it is God that worketh in you to will\nand to do of his own good pleasure.” How correspondent is the one with\nthe other; work for He works: there were no working at all to any\npurpose, or with any hope, if He did not work. And work with fear and\ntrembling, for He works of His own good pleasure, q.d., “’Twere the\ngreatest folly imaginable to trifle with One that works at so perfect\nliberty, under no obligation, that may desist when He will; to impose\nupon so absolutely sovereign and arbitrary an Agent, that owes you\nnothing; and from whose former gracious operations not complied with\nyou can draw no argument, unto any following ones, that because He\ndoth, therefore He will. As there is no certain connection between\npresent time and future, but all time is made up of undepending, not\nstrictly coherent, moments, so as no man can be sure, because one\nnow exists, another shall; there is also no more certain connection\nbetween the arbitrary acts of a free agent within such time; so that\nI can not be sure, because He now darts in light upon me, is now\nconvincing me, now awakening me, therefore He will still do so, again\nand again.” Upon this ground then, what exhortation could be more\nproper than this? “Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.\"\nWhat could be more awfully monitory and enforcing of it than that He\nworks only of mere good will and pleasured How should I tremble to\nthink, if I should be negligent, or undutiful, He may give out the\nnext moment, may let the work fall, and me perish? And there is more\nespecial cause for such an apprehension upon the concurrence of such\nthings as these:",
        "1. If the workings of God’s Spirit upon the soul of a man have been\nmore than ordinarily strong and urgent, and do not now cease: if\nthere have been more powerful convictions, deeper humiliations, more\nawakened fears, more formed purposes of a new life, more fervent\ndesires that are now vanished, and the sinner returns to his dead and\ndull temper.",
        "2. If there be no disposition to reflect and consider the difference,\nno sense of his loss, but he apprehends such workings of spirit in him\nunnecessary troubles to him, and thinks it well he is delivered and\neased of them.",
        "3. If in the time when he was under such workings of the Spirit he\nhad made known his case to his minister, or any godly friend, whose\ncompany he now shuns, as not willing to be put in mind, or hear any\nmore of such matters.",
        "4. If, hereupon he hath more indulged sensual inclination, taken more\nliberty, gone against the check of his own conscience, broken former\ngood resolutions, involved himself in the guilt of any grosser sins.",
        "5. If conscience, so baffled, be now silent, lets him alone, grows\nmore sluggish and weaker, which it must as his lusts grow stronger.",
        "6. If the same lively, powerful ministry which before affected him\nmuch, now moves him not.",
        "7. If especially he is grown into a dislike of such preaching–if\nserious godliness, and what tends to it, are become distasteful to\nhim–if discourses of God, and of Christ, of death and judgment, and\nof a holy life, are reckoned superflous and needless, are unsavory and\ndisrelished–if he have learned to put disgraceful names upon\nthings of this import, and the persons that most value them live\naccordingly–if he hath taken the seat of the scorner, and makes it\nhis business to deride what he had once a reverence for, or took some\ncomplacency in.",
        "8. If, upon all this, God withdraw such a ministry, so that he is now\nwarned, admonished, exhorted and striven with, as formerly, no more.\nOh, the fearful danger of that man’s case! Hath he no cause to fear\nlest the things of his peace should be forever hid from his eyes?\nSurely he hath much cause of fear, but mot of despair. Fear in this\ncase would be his great duty, and might yet prove the means of saving\nhim–despair would be his very heinous and destroying sin. If yet he\nwould be stirred up to consider his case, whence he is fallen, and\nwhither he is falling, and set himself to serious seekings of God,\ncast down himself before Him, abase himself, cry for mercy as for his\nlife, there is yet hope in his case. God may make here an instance\nwhat He can obtain of Himself to do for a perishing wretch. But if\nwith any that have lived under the gospel, their day is quite expired,\nand the things of their peace now forever hid from their eyes, this is\nin itself a most deplorable case, and much lamented by our Lord Jesus\nHimself. That the case is in itself most deplorable, who sees not? A\nsoul lost! a creature capable of God! upon its way to Him! near to the\nkingdom of God! shipwrecked in the port! Oh, sinner, from how high a\nhope art thou fallen! into what depths of misery and we! And that it\nwas lamented by our Lord is in the text. He beheld the city (very\ngenerally, we have reason to apprehend, inhabited by such wretched\ncreatures) and wept over it. This was a very affectionate lamentation.\nWe lament often, very heartily, many a sad case for which we do not\nshed tears. But tears, such tears, falling from such eyes! the issues\nof the purest and best-governed passion that ever was, showed the true\ngreatness of the cause. Here could be no exorbitancy or unjust excess,\nnothing more than was proportional to the occasion. There needs no\nother proof that this is a sad case than that our Lord lamented it\nwith tears, which that He did we are plainly told, so that, touching\nthat, there is no place for doubt. All that is liable to question is,\nwhether we are to conceive in Him any like resentments of such cases,\nin His present glorified state? Indeed, we can not think heaven a\nplace or state of sadness or lamentation, and must take heed of\nconceiving anything there, especially on the throne of glory,\nunsuitable to the most perfect nature, and the most glorious state. We\nare not to imagine tears there, which, in that happy region are wiped\naway from inferior eyes–no grief, sorrow, or sighing, which are all\nfled away, and shall be no more, as there can be no other turbid\npassion of any kind. But when expressions that import anger or grief\nare used, even concerning God Himself, we must sever in our conception\neverything of imperfection, and ascribe everything of real perfection.\nWe are not to think such expressions signify nothing, that they have\nno meaning, or that nothing at all is to be attributed to Him under\nthem. Nor are we again to think they signify the same thing with what\nwe find in ourselves, and are wont to express by those names. In the\ndivine nature there may be real, and yet most serene, complacency and\ndisplacency–viz., that, unaccompanied by the least commotion, that\nimpart nothing of imperfection, but perfection rather, as it is a\nperfection to apprehend things suitably to what in themselves they\nare. The holy Scriptures frequently speak of God as angry, and grieved\nfor the sins of men, and their miseries which ensue therefrom. And\na real aversion and dislike is signified thereby, and by many other\nexpressions, which in us would signify vehement agitations of\naffection, that we are sure can have no place in Him. We ought,\ntherefore, in our own thoughts to ascribe to Him that calm aversion of\nwill, in reference to the sins and miseries of men in general; and in\nour own apprehensions to remove to the utmost distance from Him all\nsuch agitations of passion or affection, even tho some expressions\nthat occur carry a great appearance thereof, should they be understood\naccording to human measures, as they are human forms of speech. As, to\ninstance in what is said by the glorious God Himself, and very near in\nsense to what we have in the text, what can be more pathetic than that\nlamenting wish, “Oh, that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel\nhad walked in my ways!” But we must take heed lest, under the pretense\nthat we can not ascribe everything to God that such expressions seem\nto import, we therefore ascribe nothing. We ascribe nothing, if we do\nnot ascribe a real unwillingness that men should sin on, and perish,\nand consequently a real willingness that they should turn to Him,\nand live, which so many plain texts assert. And therefore it is\nunavoidably imposed upon us to believe that God is truly unwilling of\nsome things which He doth not think fit to interpose His omnipotency\nto hinder, and is truly willing of some things which He doth not put\nforth His omnipotency to effect.",
        "We can not, therefore, doubt but that,",
        "1. He distinctly comprehends the truth of any such case. He beholds,\nfrom the throne of His glory above, all the treaties which are held\nand managed with sinners in His name, and what their deportments are\ntherein. His eyes are as a flame of fire, wherewith He searcheth\nhearts and trieth reins. He hath seen therefore, sinner, all along\nevery time an offer of grace hath been made to thee, and been\nrejected; when thou hast slighted counsels and warnings that have been\ngiven thee, exhortations and treaties that have been prest upon thee\nfor many years together, and how thou hast hardened thy heart against\nreproofs and threatenings, against promises and allurements, and\nbeholds the tendency of all this, what is like to come to it, and\nthat, if thou persist, it will be bitterness in the end.",
        "2. That He hath a real dislike of the sinfulness of thy course. It is\nnot indifferent to Him whether thou obeyest or disobeyest the gospel,\nwhether thou turn and repent or no; that He is truly displeased at thy\ntrifling, sloth, negligence, impenitency, hardness of heart, stubborn\nobstinacy, and contempt of His grace, and takes real offense at them.",
        "3. He hath real kind propensions toward thee, and is ready to receive\nthy returning soul, and effectually to mediate with the offended\nmajesty of Heaven for thee, as long as there is any hope in thy case.",
        "4. When He sees there is no hope, He pities thee, while thou seest it\nnot, and dost not pity thyself. Pity and mercy above are not names\nonly; ’tis a great reality that is signified by them, and that hath\nplace here in far higher excellency and perfection than it can with us\npoor mortals here below. Ours is but borrowed and participated\nfrom that first fountain and original above. Thou dost not perish\nunlamented even with the purest heavenly pity, tho thou hast made thy\ncase incapable of remedy; as the well tempered judge bewails the sad\nend of the malefactor, whom justice obliges him not to spare or save.",
        "And that thou mayst not throw away thy soul and so great a hope,\nthrough mere sloth and loathness to be at some pains for thy life, let\nthe text, which hath been thy directory about the things that belong\nto thy peace, be also thy motive, as it gives thee to behold the Son\nof God weeping over such as would not know those things. Shall not the\nRedeemer’s tears move thee? O hard heart! Consider what these tears\nimport to this purpose.",
        "1. They signify the real depth and greatness of the misery into\nwhich thou are falling. They drop from an intellectual and most\ncomprehensive eye, that sees far and pierces deep into things, hath a\nwide and large prospect; takes the comfort of that forlorn state into\nwhich unreconcilable sinners are hastening, in all the horror of it.\nThe Son of God did not weep vain and causeless tears, or for a light\nmatter; nor did He for Himself either spend His own or desire\nthe profusion of others’ tears. “Weep not for me, O daughters of\nJerusalem,” etc. He knows the value of souls, the weight of guilt, and\nhow low it will press and sink them; the severity of God’s justice and\nthe power of His anger, and what the fearful effects of them will\nbe when they finally fall. If thou understandest not these things\nthyself, believe Him that did; at least believe His tears.",
        "2. They signify the sincerity of His love and pity, the truth and\ntenderness of His compassion. Canst thou think His deceitful tears?\nHis, who never knew guile? Was this like the rest of His course? And\nremember that He who shed tears did, from the same fountain of love\nand mercy, shed blood too! Was that also done to deceive? Thou makest\nthyself a very considerable thing indeed, if thou thinkest the Son of\nGod counted it worth His while to weep, and bleed, and die, to deceive\nthee into a false esteem of Him and His love. But if it be the\ngreatest madness imaginable to entertain any such thought but that His\ntears were sincere and unartificial, the natural, genuine expression\nof undissembled benignity and pity, thou art then to consider what\nlove and compassion thou art now sinning against; what bowels thou\nspurnest; and that if thou perishest, ’tis under such guilt as the\ndevils themselves are not liable to, who never had a Redeemer bleeding\nfor them, nor, that we ever find, weeping over them.",
        "3. They show the remedilessness of thy case if thou persist in\nimpenitency and unbelief till the things of thy peace be quite hid\nfrom thine eyes. These tears will then be the last issues of (even\ndefeated) love, of love that is frustrated of its kind design. Thou\nmayst perceive in these tears the steady, unalterable laws of\nheaven, the inflexibleness of the divine justice, that holds thee in\nadamantine bonds, and hath sealed thee up, if thou prove incurably\nobstinate and impenitent, unto perdition; so that even the Redeemer\nHimself, He that is mighty to save, can not at length save thee, but\nonly weep over thee, drop tears into thy flame, which assuage it not;\nbut (tho they have another design, even to express true compassion) do\nyet unavoidably heighten and increase the fervor of it, and will do so\nto all eternity. He even tells thee, sinner, “Thou hast despised My\nblood; thou shalt yet have My tears.” That would have saved thee,\nthese do only lament thee lost. But the tears wept over others, as\nlost and past hope, why should they not yet melt thee, while as yet\nthere is hope in thy case? If thou be effectually melted in thy very\nsoul, and looking to Him whom thou hast pierced, dost truly mourn over\nHim, thou mayst assure thyself the prospect His weeping eye had of\nlost souls did not include thee. His weeping over thee would argue thy\ncase forlorn and hopeless; thy mourning over Him will make it safe and\nhappy. That it may be so, consider, further, that,",
        "4. They signify how very intent He is to save souls, and how gladly\nHe would save thine, if yet thou wilt accept of mercy while it may be\nhad. For if He weep over them that will not be saved, from the same\nlove that is the spring of these tears, would saving mercies proceed\nto those that are become willing to receive them. And that love that\nwept over them that were lost, how will it glory in them that are\nsaved! There His love is disappointed and vexed, crossed in its\ngracious intendment; but here, having compassed it, how will He joy\nover thee with singing, and rest in His love! And thou also, instead\nof being revolved in a like ruin with the unreconciled sinners of old\nJerusalem, shalt be enrolled among the glorious citizens of the new,\nand triumph together with them in glory.",
        "THE PASSION OF CHRIST",
        "Louis Bourdaloue was born at Bourges, in 1632. At the age of sixteen\nhe entered the order of the Jesuits and was thoroughly educated in the\nscholarship, philosophy and theology of the day. He devoted himself\nentirely to the work of preaching, and was ten times called upon\nto address Louis XIV and his court from the pulpit as Bossuet’s\nsuccessor. This was an unprecedented record and yet Bourdaloue could\nadapt his style to any audience, and “mechanics left their shops,\nmerchants their business, and lawyers their court house” to hear\nhim. His high personal character, his simplicity of life, his clear,\ndirect, and logical utterance as an accomplished orator united to\nmake him not only “the preacher of kings but the king of preachers.\"\nRetiring from the pulpit late in life he ministered to the sick and to\nprisoners. He died in Paris, 1704.",
        "1632-1704",
        "THE PASSION OF CHRIST",
        "And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which\nalso bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning unto them, said,\n\"Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for your selves,\nand for your children.\"–Luke xxiii., 27, 28.",
        "The passion of Jesus Christ, however sorrowful and ignominious it may\nappear to us, must nevertheless have been to Jesus Christ Himself an\nobject of delight, since this God-man, by a wonderful secret of His\nwisdom and love, has willed that the mystery of it shall be continued\nand solemnly renewed in His Church until the final consummation of the\nworld. For what is the Eucharist but a perpetual repetition of the\nSavior’s passion, and what has the Savior supposed in instituting\nit, but that whatever passed at Calvary is not only represented but\nconsummated on our altars? That is to say, that He is still performing\nthe functions of the victim anew, and is every moment virtually\nsacrificed, as tho it were not sufficient that He should have suffered\nonce; at least that His love, as powerful as it is free, has given to\nHis adorable sufferings that character of perpetuity which they have\nin the Sacrament, and which renders them so salutary to us. Behold,\nChristians, what the love of God has devised; but behold, also, what\nhas happened through the malice of men! At the same time that Jesus\nChrist, in the sacrament of His body, repeats His holy passion in a\nmanner altogether mysterious, men, the false imitators, or rather base\ncorrupters of the works of God, have found means to renew this same\npassion, not only in a profane, but in a criminal, sacrilegious, and\nhorrible manner!",
        "Do not imagine that I speak figuratively. Would to God, Christians,\nthat what I am going to say to you were only a figure, and that you\nwere justified in vindicating yourselves to-day against the horrible\nexpressions which I am obliged to employ! I speak in the literal\nsense, and you ought to be more affected with this discourse, if what\nI advance appears to you to be overcharged; for it is by your excesses\nthat it is so, and not by my words. Yes, my dear hearers, the sinners\nof the age, by the disorders of their lives, renew the bloody and\ntragic passion of the Son of God in the world; I will venture to say\nthat the sinners of the age cause to the Son of God, even in the state\nof glory, as many new passions as they have committed outrages against\nHim by their actions! Apply yourselves to form an idea of them; and in\nthis picture, which will surprize you, recognize what you are, that\nyou may weep bitterly over yourselves! What do we see in the passion\nof Jesus Christ? A divine Savior betrayed and abandoned by cowardly\ndisciples, persecuted by pontiffs and hypocritical priests, ridiculed\nand mocked in the palace of Herod by impious courtiers, placed upon a\nlevel with Barabbas, and to whom Barabbas is preferred by a blind and\ninconstant people, exposed to the insults of libertinism, and treated\nas a mock king by a troop of soldiers equally barbarous and insolent;\nin fine, crucified by merciless executioners! Behold, in a few words,\nwhat is most humiliating and most cruel in the death of the Savior of\nthe world! Then tell me if this is not precisely what we now see,\nof what we are every day called to be witnesses. Let us resume; and\nfollow me.",
        "Betrayed and abandoned by cowardly disciples; such, O divine Savior,\nhas been Thy destiny. But it was not enough that the apostles, the\nfirst men whom Thou didst choose for Thine own, in violation of the\nmost holy engagement, should have forsaken Thee in the last scene of\nThy life; that one of them should have sold Thee, another renounced\nThee, and all disgraced themselves by a flight which was, perhaps, the\nmost sensible of all the wounds that Thou didst feel in dying. This\nwound must be again opened by a thousand acts of infidelity yet more\nscandalous. Even in the Christian ages we must see men bearing the\ncharacter of Thy disciples, and not having the resolution to sustain\nit; Christians, prevaricators, and deserters from their faith;\nChristians ashamed of declaring themselves for Thee, not daring to\nappear what they are, renouncing at least in the exterior what they\nhave profest, flying when they ought to fight; in a word, Christians\nin form, ready to follow Thee even to the Supper when in prosperity,\nand while it required no sacrifice, but resolved to abandon Thee in\nthe moment of temptation. It is on your account, and my own, my dear\nhearers, that I speak, and behold what ought to be the subject of our\nsorrow.",
        "A Savior mortally persecuted by pontiffs and hypocritical priests!\nLet us not enter, Christians, into the discussion of this article, at\nwhich your piety would, perhaps, be offended, and which would weaken\nor prejudice the respect which you owe to the ministers of the Lord.\nIt belongs to us, my brethren, to meditate to-day on this fact in the\nspirit of holy compunction; to us consecrated to the ministry of the\naltars, to us priests of Jesus Christ, whom God has chosen in His\nChurch to be the dispensers of His sacraments. It does not become me\nto remonstrate in this place. God forbid that I should undertake to\njudge those who sustain the sacred office! This is not the duty of\nhumility to which my condition calls me. Above all, speaking as I do,\nbefore many ministers, the irreprehensible life of whom contributes so\nmuch to the edification of the people, I am not yet so infatuated as\nto make myself the judge, much less the censor of their conduct.",
        "But tho it should induce you only to acknowledge the favors with which\nGod prevents you, as a contrast, from the frightful blindness into\nwhich He permits others to fall, remember that the priests and the\nprinces of the priests, are those whom the evangelist describes as the\nauthors of the conspiracy formed against the Savior of the world, and\nof the wickedness committed against Him. Remember that this scandal\nis notoriously public, and renewed still every day in Christianity.\nRemember, but with fear and horror, that the greatest persecutors of\nJesus Christ are not lay libertines, but wicked priests; and that\namong the wicked priests, those whose corruption and iniquity are\ncovered with the veil of hypocrisy are His most dangerous and most\ncruel enemies. A hatred, disguised under the name of zeal, and covered\nwith the specious pretext of observance of the law, was the first\nmovement of the persecution which the Pharisees and the priests raised\nagainst the Son of God. Let us fear lest the same passion should blind\nus! Wretched passion, exclaims St. Bernard, which spreads the venom of\nits malignity even over the most lovely of the children of men, and\nwhich could not see a God upon earth without hating Him! A hatred not\nonly of the prosperity and happiness, but what is yet more strange, of\nthe merit and perfection of others! A cowardly and shameful passion,\nwhich, not content with having caused the death of Jesus Christ,\ncontinues to persecute Him by rending His mystical body, which is the\nChurch; dividing His members, which are believers; and stifling in\ntheir hearts that charity which is the spirit of Christianity! Behold,\nmy brethren, the subtle temptation against which we have to defend\nourselves, and under which it is but too common for us to fall!",
        "A Redeemer reviled and mocked in the palace of Herod by the impious\ncreatures of his court! This was, without doubt, one of the most\nsensible insults which Jesus Christ received. But do not suppose,\nChristians, that this act of impiety ended there. It has passed from\nthe court of Herod, from that prince destitute of religion, into those\neven of Christian princes. And is not the Savior still a subject of\nridicule to the libertine spirits which compose them? They worship Him\nexternally, but internally how do they regard His maxims? What idea\nhave they of His humility, of His poverty, of His sufferings? Is not\nvirtue either unknown or despised? It is not a rash zeal which\ninduces me to speak in this manner; it is what you too often witness,\nChristians; it is what you perhaps feel in yourselves; and a little\nreflection upon the manners of the court will convince you that there\nis nothing that I say which is not confirmed by a thousand examples,\nand that you yourselves are sometimes unhappy accomplices in these\ncrimes.",
        "Herod had often earnestly wished to see Jesus Christ. The reputation\nwhich so many miracles had given Him, excited the curiosity of this\nprince, and he did not doubt but that a man who commanded all nature\nmight strike some wonderful blow to escape from the persecution of His\nenemies. But the Son of God, who had not been sparing of His prodigies\nfor the salvation of others, spared them for Himself, and would not\nsay a single word about His own safety. He considered Herod and his\npeople as profane persons, with whom he thought it improper to hold\nany intercourse, and he preferred rather to pass for a fool than to\nsatisfy the false wisdom of the world. As His kingdom was not of this\nworld, as He said to Pilate, it was not at the court that He designed\nto establish Himself. He knew too well that His doctrine could not\nbe relished in a place where the rules of worldly wisdom only were\nfollowed, and where all the miracles which He had performed had\nnot been sufficient to gain men full of love for themselves and\nintoxicated with their greatness. In this corrupted region they\nbreathe only the air of vanity; they esteem only that which is\nsplendid; they speak only of preferment: and on whatever side we cast\nour eyes, we see nothing but what either flatters or inflames the\nambitious desires of the heart of man.",
        "What probability then was there that Jesus Christ, the most humble\nof all men, should obtain a hearing where only pageantry and pride\nprevail! If He had been surrounded with honors and riches, He would\nhave found partisans near Herod and in every other place. But as He\npreached a renunciation of the world both to His disciples and to\nHimself, let us not be astonished that they treated Him with so much\ndisdain. Such is the prediction of the holy man Job, and which after\nHim must be accomplished in the person of all the righteous; “the\nupright man is laughed to scorn.” In fact, my dear hearers, you know\nthat, whatever virtue and merit we may possess, they are not enough\nto procure us esteem at court. Enter it, and appear only like Jesus\nChrist, clothed with the robe of innocence; only walk with Jesus\nChrist in the way of simplicity; only speak as Jesus Christ to render\ntestimony to the truth, and you will find that you meet with no better\ntreatment there than Jesus Christ. To be well received there, you must\nhave pomp and splendor. To keep your station there, you must have\nartifice and intrigue. To be favorably heard there, you must have\ncomplaisance and flattery. Then all this is opposed to Jesus Christ;\nand the court being what it is–that is to say, the kingdom of the\nprince of this world–it is not surprizing that the kingdom of Jesus\nChrist can not be established there. But wo to you, princes of the\nearth! Wo to you, men of the world, who despise this incarnate wisdom,\nfor you shall be despised in your turn, and the contempt which shall\nfall upon you shall be much more terrible than the contempt which you\nmanifest can be prejudicial.",
        "A Savior placed upon a level with Barabbas, and to whom Barabbas is\npreferred by a blind and fickle rabble! How often have we been guilty\nof the same outrage against Jesus Christ as the blind and fickle Jews!\nHow often, after having received Him in triumph in the sacrament of\nthe communion, seduced by cupidity, have we not preferred either a\npleasure or interest after which we sought, in violation of His law,\nto this God of glory! How often divided between conscience which\ngoverned us, and passion which corrupted us, have we not renewed this\nabominable judgment, this unworthy preference of the creature even\nabove our God! Christians, observe this application; it is that of St.\nChrysostom, and if you properly understand it, you must be affected by\nit. Conscience, which, in spite of ourselves, presides in us as judge,\nsaid inwardly to us, “What art thou going to do? Behold thy pleasure\non the one hand, and thy God on the other: for which of the two dost\nthou declare thyself? for thou canst not save both; thou must either\nlose thy pleasure or thy God; and it is for thee to decide.” And the\npassion, which by a monstrous infidelity had acquired the influence\nover our hearts, made us conclude–I will keep my pleasure. “But what\nthen will become of thy God,” replied conscience secretly, “and\nwhat must I do, I, who can not prevent myself from maintaining His\ninterests against thee?” I care not what will become of my God,\nanswered passion insolently; I will satisfy myself, and the resolution\nis taken. “But dost thou know,” proceeded conscience by its remorse,\n\"that in indulging thyself in this pleasure it will at last submit thy\nSavior to death and crucifixion for thee?” It is of no consequence if\nHe be crucified, provided I can have my enjoyments. “But what evil has\nHe done, and what reason hast thou to abandon Him in this manner?” My\npleasure is my reason; and since Christ is the enemy of my pleasure,\nand my pleasure crucifies Him, I say it again, let Him be crucified.",
        "Behold, my dear hearers, what passes every day in the consciences of\nmen, and what passes in you and in me, every time that we fall into\nsin, which causes death to Jesus Christ, as well as to our souls!\nBehold what makes the enormity and wickedness of this sin! I know that\nwe do not always speak, that we do not always explain ourselves in\nsuch express terms and in so perceptible a manner; but after all,\nwithout explaining ourselves so distinctly and so sensibly, there is a\nlanguage of the heart which says all this. For, from the moment that I\nknow that this pleasure is criminal and forbidden of God, I know that\nit is impossible for me to desire it, impossible to seek it, without\nlosing God; and consequently I prefer this pleasure to God in the\ndesire that I form of it, and in the pursuit that I make after it.\nThis, then, is sufficient to justify the thought of St. Chrysostom and\nthe doctrine of the theologians upon the nature of deadly sin ...",
        "That there are men, and Christian men, to whom, by a secret judgment\nof God, the passion of Jesus Christ, salutary as it is, may become\nuseless, is a truth too essential in our religion to be unknown, and\ntoo sorrowful not to be the subject of our grief. When the Savior from\nthe height of His cross, ready to give up His spirit, raised this cry\ntoward heaven, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” there\nwas no one who did not suppose but that the violence of His torments\nforced from Him this complaint, and perhaps we ourselves yet believe\nit. But the great Bishop Arnauld de Chartres, penetrating deeper into\nthe thoughts and affections of this dying Savior, says, with much more\nreason, that the complaint of Christ Jesus to His Father proceeded\nfrom the sentiment with which He was affected, in representing to\nHimself the little fruit which His death would produce; in considering\nthe small number of the elect who would profit by it; in foreseeing\nwith horror the infinite number of the reprobate, for whom it would\nbe useless: as if He had wished to proclaim that His merits were not\nfully enough nor worthily enough remunerated; and that after having\ndone so much work He had a right to promise to Himself a different\nsuccess in behalf of men. The words of this author are admirable:\nJesus Christ complains, says this learned prelate, but of what does He\ncomplain? That the wickedness of sinners makes Him lose what ought to\nbe the reward of the conflicts which He has maintained; that millions\nof the human race for whom He suffers will, nevertheless, be excluded\nfrom the benefit of redemption. And because He regards Himself in them\nas their head, and themselves, in spite of their worthlessness, as\nthe members of His mystical body; seeing them abandoned by God, He\ncomplains of being abandoned Himself: “My God, my God, why hast\nthou forsaken me?” He complains of what made St. Paul groan when,\ntransported with an apostolic zeal, he said to the Galatians: “What,\nmy brethren, is Jesus Christ then dead in vain? Is the mystery of\nthe cross then nothing to you? Will not this blood which He has so\nabundantly shed have the virtue to sanctify you?”",
        "But here, Christians, I feel myself affected with a thought which,\ncontrary as it appears to that of the apostle, only serves to\nstrengthen and confirm it. For it appears that St. Paul is grieved\nbecause Jesus Christ has suffered in vain; but I, I should almost\nconsole myself if He had only suffered in vain, and if His passion was\nonly rendered useless to us. That which fills me with consternation\nis, that at the same time that we render it useless to ourselves, by\nan inevitable necessity it must become pernicious; for this passion,\nsays St. Gregory of Nazianzen, “partakes of the nature of those\nremedies which, kill if they do not heal, and of which the effect is\neither to give life or to convert itself into poison; lose nothing of\nthis, I beseech you.” Remember, then, Christians, what happened during\nthe judgment and at the moment of the condemnation of the Son of God.",
        "When Pilate washed his hands before the Jews and declared to them that\nthere was nothing worthy of death in this righteous man, but that the\ncrime from which he freed himself rested upon them, and that they\nwould have to answer for it, they all cried with one voice that they\nconsented to it, and that they readily agreed that the blood of this\njust man should fall upon them and upon their children. You know what\nthis cry has cost them. You know the curses which one such imprecation\nhas drawn upon them, the anger of heaven which began from that time\nto burst upon this nation, the ruin of Jerusalem which followed soon\nafter–the carnage of their citizens, the profanation of their temple,\nthe destruction of their republic, the visible character of their\nreprobation which their unhappy posterity bear to this day, that\nuniversal banishment, that exile of sixteen hundred years, that\nslavery through all the earth–and all in consequence of the authentic\nprediction which Jesus Christ made to them of it when going to\nCalvary, and with circumstances which incontestably prove that a\npunishment as exemplary as this can not be imputed but to decide which\nthey had committed in the person of the Savior; since it is evident,\nsays St. Augustine, that the Jews were never further from idolatry nor\nmore religious observers of their law than they were then, and that,\nexcepting the crime of the death of Jesus Christ, God, very far from\npunishing them, would, it seems, rather have loaded them with His\nblessings. You know all this, I say; and all this is a convincing\nproof that the blood of this God-man is virtually fallen upon these\nsacrilegious men, and that God, in condemning them by their own mouth,\naltho in spite of Himself, employs that to destroy them which was\ndesigned for their salvation.",
        "But, Christians, to speak with the Holy Spirit, this has happened to\nthe Jews only as a figure; it is only the shadow of the fearful curses\nof which the abuse of the merits and passion of the Son of God must be\nto us the source and the measure. I will explain myself. What do we,\nmy dear hearers, when borne away by the immoderate desires of our\nhearts to a sin against which our consciences protest? And what do\nwe, when, possest of the spirit of the world, we resist a grace which\nsolicits us, which presses us to obey God? Without thinking upon it,\nand without wishing it, we secretly pronounce the same sentence of\ndeath which the Jews pronounced against themselves before Pilate, when\nthey said to him, “His blood be upon us.” For this grace which we\ndespise is the price of the blood of Jesus Christ, and the sin that we\ncommit is an actual profanation of this very blood. It is, then, as if\nwe were to say to God: “Lord, I clearly see what engagement I make,\nand I know what risk I run, but rather than not satisfy my own\ndesires, I consent that the blood of Thy Son shall fall upon me. This\nwill be to bear the chastisement of it, but I will indulge my passion;\nThou hast a right to draw forth from it a just indignation, but\nnevertheless I will complete my undertaking.”",
        "Thus we condemn ourselves. And here, Christians, is one of the\nessential foundations of this terrible mystery of the eternity of the\npunishment with which faith threatens us, and against which our reason\nrevolts. We suppose that we can not have any knowledge of it in this\nlife, and we are not aware, says St. Chrysostom, that we find it\ncompletely in the blood of the Savior, or rather in our profanation of\nit every day. For this blood, my brethren, adds this holy doctor, is\nenough to make eternity not less frightful, but less incredible.\nAnd behold the reason: This blood is of an infinite dignity; it can\ntherefore be avenged only by an infinite punishment. This blood, if we\ndestroy ourselves, will cry eternally against us at the tribunal of\nGod. It will eternally excite the wrath of God against us. This blood,\nfalling upon lost souls, will fix a stain upon them, which shall never\nbe effaced. Their torments must consequently never end.",
        "A reprobate in hell will always appear in the eyes of God stained with\nthat blood which he has so basely treated. God will then always abhor\nhim; and, as the aversion of God from His creature is that which makes\nhell, it must be inferred that hell will be eternal. And in this, O my\nGod, Thou art sovereignly just, sovereignly holy, and worthy of our\npraise and adoration. It is in this way that the beloved disciple\ndeclared it even to God Himself in the Apocalypse. Men, said he, have\nshed the blood of Thy servants and of Thy prophets; therefore\nthey deserve to drink it, and to drink it from the cup of Thine\nindignation. “For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets,\nand thou hast given them blood to drink.” An expression which the\nScripture employs to describe the extreme infliction of divine\nvengeance. Ah! if the blood of the prophets has drawn down the scourge\nof God upon men, what may we not expect from the blood of Jesus\nChrist? If the blood of martyrs is heard crying out in heaven against\nthe persecutors of the faith, how much more will the blood of the\nRedeemer be heard!",
        "Then once more, Christians, behold the deplorable necessity to which\nwe are reduced. This blood which flows from Calvary either demands\ngrace for us, or justice against us. When we apply ourselves to it by\na lively faith and a sincere repentance, it demands grace; but when by\nour disorders and impieties we check its salutary virtue, it demands\njustice, and it infallibly obtains it. It is in this blood, says St.\nBernard, that all righteous souls are purified; but by a prodigy\nexactly opposite, it is also in this same blood that all the sinners\nof the land defile themselves, and render themselves, if I may use the\nexpression, more hideous in the sight of God.",
        "Ah! my God, shall I eternally appear in thine eyes polluted with that\nblood which washes away the crimes of others? If I had simply to\nbear my own sins, I might promise myself a punishment less rigorous,\nconsidering my sins as my misfortune, my weakness, my ignorance. Then,\nperhaps, Thou wouldst be less offended on account of them. But when\nthese sins with which I shall be covered shall present themselves\nbefore me as so many sacrileges with respect to the blood of Thy Son;\nwhen the abuse of this blood shall be mixed and confounded with all\nthe disorders of my life; when there shall not be one of them against\nwhich this blood shall not cry louder than the blood of Abel against\nCain; then, O God of my soul I what will become of me in thy presence?\nNo, Lord, cries the same St. Bernard affectionately, suffer not the\nblood of my Savior to fall upon me in this manner. Let it fall upon me\nto sanctify, but let it not fall upon me to destroy. Let it fall upon\nme in a right use of the favors which are the divine overflowings of\nit, and not through the blindness of mind and hardness of heart which\nare the most terrible punishments of it. Let it fall upon me by the\nparticipation of the sacred Eucharist, which is the precious source\nof it, and not by the maledictions attached to the despisers of Thy\nsacraments. In fine, let it fall upon me by influencing my conduct and\ninducing the practise of good works, and let it not fall upon me for\nmy wanderings, my infidelities, my obstinacy, and my impenitence.\nThis, my brethren, is what we ought to ask to-day from Jesus Christ\ncrucified. It is with these views that we ought to go to the foot of\nthe cross and catch the blood as it flows. He was the Savior of the\nJews as well as ours, but this Savior, St. Augustine says, the Jews\nhave converted into their judge. Avert from us such an evil. May He\nWho died to save us be our Savior. May He be our Savior during all the\ndays of our lives. And may His merits, shed upon us abundantly, lose\nnone of their efficacy in our hands, but be preserved entire by the\nfruits we produce from them. May He be our Savior in death. And at the\nlast moment may the cross be our support, and thus may He consummate\nthe work of our salvation which He has begun. May He be our Savior in\na blest eternity, where we shall be as much the sharer in His glory as\nwe have been in His sufferings.",
        "THE SAINTS CONVERSE WITH GOD",
        "François de Salignac de La Mothe-Fénelon, Archbishop of Cambray, and\nprivate tutor to the heir-apparent of France, was born of a noble\nfamily in Perigord, 1651. In 1675 he received holy orders, and soon\nafterward made the acquaintance of Bossuet, whom he henceforth looked\nup to as his master. It was the publication of his “De l’Éducation des\nFilles” that brought him his first fame, and had some influence in\nsecuring his appointment in 1689 to be preceptor of the Duke of\nBurgundy. In performing this office he thought it necessary to\ncompose his own text-books, such as would teach the vanity of worldly\ngreatness and the loftiness of virtue. He was promoted to the\narchbishopric of Cambray in 1695, and subsequently became entangled\nin the religious aberrations of Madame Guyon. Fénelon came into\ncontroversy with Bossuet, whose severity against his friend was\nrebuked by the Pope, who, nevertheless, condemned some of the\nArchbishop of Cambray’s views. Fénelon submitted, and withdrew to\nhis diocesan see, where he died in 1715. His deep spirituality and\neloquence are exemplified in the following sermon.",
        "1651-1715",
        "THE SAINTS CONVERSE WITH GOD",
        "Pray without ceasing.–I Thess. v., 17",
        "Of all the duties enjoined by Christianity none is more essential, and\nyet more neglected, than prayer. Most people consider this exercise a\nwearisome ceremony, which they are justified in abridging as much as\npossible. Even those whose profession or fears lead them to pray, do\nit with such languor and wanderings of mind that their prayers, far\nfrom drawing down blessings, only increase their condemnation. I wish\nto demonstrate, in this discourse, first, the general necessity of\nprayer; secondly, its peculiar duty; thirdly, the manner in which we\nought to pray.",
        "First. God alone can instruct us in our duty. The teachings of men,\nhowever wise and well disposed they may be, are still ineffectual, if\nGod do not shed on the soul that light which opens the mind to truth.\nThe imperfections of our fellow creatures cast a shade over the truths\nthat we learn from them. Such is our weakness that we do not receive,\nwith sufficient docility, the instructions of those who are as\nimperfect as ourselves. A thousand suspicions, jealousies, fears, and\nprejudices prevent us from profiting, as we might, by what we hear\nfrom men; and tho they announce the most serious truths, yet what they\ndo weakens the effect of what they say. In a word, it is God alone who\ncan perfectly teach us.",
        "St. Bernard said, in writing to a pious friend–If you are seeking\nless to satisfy a vain curiosity than to get true wisdom, you will\nsooner find it in deserts than in books. The silence of the rocks and\nthe pathless forests will teach you better than the eloquence of the\nmost gifted men. “All,” says St. Augustine, “that we possess of truth\nand wisdom is a borrowed good flowing from that fountain for which\nwe ought to thirst in the fearful desert of this world, that, being\nrefreshed and invigorated by these dews from heaven, we may not faint\nupon the road that conducts us to a better country. Every attempt to\nsatisfy the cravings of our hearts at other sources only increases\nthe void. You will be always poor if you do not possess the only true\nriches.” All light that does not proceed from God is false; it only\ndazzles us; it sheds no illumination upon the difficult paths in which\nwe must walk, along the precipices that are about us.",
        "Our experience and our reflections can not, on all occasions, give us\njust and certain rules of conduct. The advice of our wisest, and most\nsincere friends is not always sufficient; many things escape their\nobservation, and many that do not are too painful to be spoken. They\nsuppress much from delicacy, or sometimes from a fear of transgressing\nthe bounds that our friendship and confidence in them will allow. The\nanimadversions of our enemies, however severe or vigilant they may\nbe, fail to enlighten us with regard to ourselves. Their malignity\nfurnishes our self-love with a pretext for the indulgence of the\ngreatest faults. The blindness of our self-love is so great that we\nfind reasons for being satisfied with ourselves, while all the world\ncondemn us. What must we learn from all this darkness? That it is\nGod alone who can dissipate it; that it is He alone whom we can never\ndoubt; that He alone is true, and knoweth all things; that if we go\nto Him in sincerity, He will teach us what men dare not tell us, what\nbooks can not–all that is essential for us to know.",
        "Be assured that the greatest obstacle to true wisdom is the\nself-confidence inspired by that which is false. The first step toward\nthis precious knowledge is earnestly to desire it, to feel the want of\nit, and to be convinced that they who seek it must address themselves\nto the Father of lights, who freely gives to him who asks in faith.\nBut if it be true that God alone can enlighten us, it is not the less\ntrue that He will do this simply in answer to our prayers. Are we not\nhappy, indeed, in being able to obtain so great a blessing by only\nasking for it? No part of the effort that we make to acquire the\ntransient enjoyments of this life is necessary to obtain these\nheavenly blessings. What will we not do, what are we not willing\nto suffer, to possess dangerous and contemptible things, and often\nwithout any success? It is not thus with heavenly things. God is\nalways ready to grant them to those who make the request in sincerity\nand truth. The Christian life is a long and continual tendency of our\nhearts toward that eternal goodness which we desire on earth. All our\nhappiness consists in thirsting for it. Now this thirst is prayer.\nEver desire to approach your Creator and you will never cease to pray.",
        "Do not think that it is necessary to pronounce many words. To pray is\nto say, Let Thy will be done. It is to form a good purpose; to\nraise your heart to God; to lament your weakness; to sigh at the\nrecollection of your frequent disobedience. This prayer demands\nneither method, nor science, nor reasoning; it is not essential to\nquit one’s employment; it is a simple movement of the heart toward its\nCreator, and a desire that whatever you are doing you may do it to His\nglory. The best of all prayers is to act with a pure intention, and\nwith a continual reference to the will of God. It depends much upon\nourselves whether our prayers be efficacious. It is not by a miracle,\nbut by a movement of the heart that we are benefited; by a submissive\nspirit. Let us believe, let us trust, let us hope, and God never will\nreject our prayer. Yet how many Christians do we see strangers to the\nprivilege, aliens from God, who seldom think of Him, who never open\ntheir hearts to Him; who seek elsewhere the counsels of a false\nwisdom, and vain and dangerous consolations, who can not resolve to\nseek, in humble, fervent prayer to God, a remedy for their griefs and\na true knowledge of their defects, the necessary power to conquer\ntheir vicious and perverse inclinations, and the consolations and\nassistance they require, that they may not be discouraged in a\nvirtuous life.",
        "But some will say, “I have no interest in prayer; it wearies me; my\nimagination is excited by sensible and more agreeable objects, and\nwanders in spite of me.”",
        "If neither your reverence for the great truths of religion, nor the\nmajesty of the ever-present Deity, nor the interest of your eternal\nsalvation, have power to arrest your mind and engage it in prayer, at\nleast mourn with me for your infidelity; be ashamed of your weakness,\nand wish that your thoughts were more under your control; and desire\nto become less frivolous and inconstant. Make an effort to subject\nyour mind to this discipline. You will gradually acquire habit and\nfacility. What is now tedious will become delightful; and you will\nthen feel, with a peace that the world can not give nor take away,\nthat God is good. Make a courageous effort to overcome yourself. There\ncan be no occasion that more demands it.",
        "Secondly. The peculiar obligation of prayer. Were I to give all the\nproofs that the subject affords, I should describe every condition\nof life, that I might point out its dangers, and the necessity of\nrecourse to God in prayer. But I will simply state that under all\ncircumstances we have need of prayer. There is no situation in which\nit is possible to be placed where we have not many virtues to acquire\nand many faults to correct. We find in our temperament, or in our\nhabits, or in the peculiar character of our minds, qualities that do\nnot suit our occupations, and that oppose our duties. One person is\nconnected by marriage to another whose temper is so unequal that life\nbecomes a perpetual warfare. Some, who are exposed to the contagious\natmosphere of the world, find themselves so susceptible to the vanity\nwhich they inhale that all their pure desires vanish. Others have\nsolemnly promised to renounce their resentments, to conquer their\naversions, to suffer with patience certain crosses, and to repress\ntheir eagerness for wealth; but nature prevails, and they are\nvindictive, violent, impatient, and avaricious.",
        "Whence comes it that these resolutions are so frail? That all these\npeople wish to improve, desire to perform their duty toward God and\nman better, and yet fail? It is because our own strength and wisdom,\nalone, are not enough. We undertake to do everything without God;\ntherefore we do not succeed. It is at the foot of the altar that we\nmust seek for counsel which will aid us. It is with God that we must\nlay our plans of virtue and usefulness; it is He alone that can render\nthem successful. Without Him, all our designs, however good they may\nappear, are only temerity and delusion. Let us then pray that we may\nlearn what we are and what we ought to be. By this means we shall not\nonly learn the number and the evil effects of our peculiar faults,\nbut we shall also learn to what virtues we are called, and the way to\npractise them. The rays of that pure and heavenly light that visit\nthe humble soul will beam on us and we shall feel and understand that\neverything is possible to those who put their whole trust in God.\nThus, not only to those who live in retirement, but to those who\nare exposed to the agitations of the world and the excitements of\nbusiness, it is peculiarly necessary, by contemplation and fervent\nprayer, to restore their souls to that serenity which the dissipations\nof life and commerce with men have disturbed. To those who are engaged\nin business, contemplation and prayer are much more difficult than to\nthose who live in retirement; but it is far more necessary for them\nto have frequent recourse to God in fervent prayer. In the most holy\noccupation a certain degree of precaution is necessary.",
        "Do not devote all your time to action, but reserve a certain portion\nof it for meditation upon eternity. We see Jesus Christ inviting His\ndisciples to go apart, in a desert place, and rest awhile, after their\nreturn from the cities, where they had been to announce His religion.\nHow much more necessary is it for us to approach the source of all\nvirtue, that we may revive our declining faith and charity, when we\nreturn from the busy scenes of life, where men speak and act as if\nthey had never known that there is a God! We should look upon prayer\nas the remedy for our weakness, the rectifier of our own faults. He\nwho was without sin prayed constantly; how much more ought we, who are\nsinners, to be faithful in prayer!",
        "Even the exercise of charity is often a snare to us. It calls us to\ncertain occupations that dissipate the mind, and that may degenerate\ninto mere amusement. It is for this reason that St. Chrysostom says\nthat nothing is so important as to keep an exact proportion between\nthe interior source of virtue and the external practise of it; else,\nlike the foolish virgins, we shall find that the oil in our lamp is\nexhausted when the bridegroom comes.",
        "The necessity we feel that God should bless our labors is another\npowerful motive to prayer. It often happens that all human help is\nvain. It is God alone that can aid us, and it does not require much\nfaith to believe that it is less our exertions, our foresight, and our\nindustry than the blessing of the Almighty that can give success to\nour wishes.",
        "Thirdly. Of the manner in which we ought to pray. 1. We must pray with\nattention. God listens to the voice of the heart, not to that of the\nlips. Our whole heart must be engaged in prayer. It must fasten upon\nwhat it prays for; and every human object must disappear from our\nminds. To whom should we speak with attention if not to God? Can He\ndemand less of us than that we should think of what we say to Him?\nDare we hope that He will listen to us, and think of us, when we\nforget ourselves in the midst of our prayers? This attention to\nprayer, which it is so just to exact from Christians, may be practised\nwith less difficulty than we imagine. It is true that the most\nfaithful souls suffer from occasional involuntary distractions. They\ncan not always control their imaginations, and, in the silence of\ntheir spirits, enter into the presence of God. But these unbidden\nwanderings of the mind ought not to trouble us; and they may conduce\nto our perfection even more than the most sublime and affecting\nprayers if we earnestly strive to overcome them, and submit with\nhumility to this experience of our infirmity. But to dwell willingly\non frivolous and worldly things during prayer, to make no effort to\ncheck the vain thoughts that intrude upon this sacred employment and\ncome between us and the Father of our spirits–is not this choosing to\nlive the sport of our senses, and separated from God?",
        "2. We must also ask with faith; a faith so firm that it never\nfalters. He who prays without confidence can not hope that his prayer\nwill be granted. Will not God love the heart that trusts in Him? Will\nHe reject those who bring all their treasures to Him, and repose\neverything upon His goodness? When we pray to God, says St. Cyprian,\nwith entire assurance, it is Himself who has given us the spirit of\nour prayer. Then it is the Father listening to the words of His child;\nit is He who dwells in our hearts, teaching us to pray. But must we\nconfess that this filial confidence is wanting in all our prayers? Is\nnot prayer our resource only when all others have failed us? If we\nlook into hearts, shall we not find that we ask of God as if we had\nnever before received benefits from Him? Shall we not discover there\na secret infidelity that renders us unworthy of His goodness? Let us\ntremble, lest, when Jesus Christ shall judge us, He pronounce the same\nreproach that He did to Peter, “O thou of little faith, wherefore\ndidst thou doubt?”",
        "3. We must join humility with trust. Great God, said Daniel, when we\nprostrate ourselves at Thy feet, we do not place our hopes for the\nsuccess of our prayers upon our righteousness, but upon Thy mercy.\nWithout this disposition in our hearts, all others, however pious they\nmay be, can not please God. St. Augustine observes that the failure of\nPeter should not be attributed to insincerity in his zeal for Jesus\nChrist. He loved his Master in good faith; in good faith he would\nrather have died than have forsaken Him; but his fault lay in trusting\nto his own strength, to do what his own heart dictated.",
        "It is not enough to possess a right spirit, an exact knowledge of\nduty, a sincere desire to perform it We must continually renew this\ndesire, and enkindle this flame within us, at the fountain of pure and\neternal light.",
        "It is the humble and contrite heart that God will not despise. Remark\nthe difference which the evangelist has pointed out between the prayer\nof the proud and presumptuous Pharisee and the humble and penitent\npublican. The one relates his virtues, the other deplores his sins.\nThe good works of the one shall be set aside, while the penitence of\nthe other shall be accepted. It will be thus with many Christians.\nSinners, vile in their own eyes, will be objects of the mercy of God;\nwhile some, who have made professions of piety, will be condemned on\naccount of the pride and arrogance that have contaminated their good\nworks. It will be so because these have said in their hearts, “Lord,\nI thank thee that I am not as other men are.” They imagine themselves\nprivileged; they pretend that they alone have penetrated the mysteries\nof the kingdom of God; they have a language and science of their own;\nthey believe that their zeal can accomplish everything. Their\nregular lives favor their vanity; but in truth they are incapable of\nself-sacrifice, and they go to their devotions with their hearts full\nof pride and presumption. Unhappy are those who pray in this manner!\nUnhappy are those whose prayers do not render them more humble, more\nsubmissive, more watchful over their faults, and more willing to live\nin obscurity!",
        "4. We must pray with love. It is love says St. Augustine, that asks,\nthat seeks, that knocks, that finds, and that is faithful to what it\nfinds. We cease to pray to God as soon as we cease to love Him, as\nsoon as we cease to thirst for His perfections. The coldness of our\nlove is the silence of our hearts toward God. Without this we may\npronounce prayers, but we do not pray; for what shall lead us to\nmeditate upon the laws of God if it be not the love of Him who has\nmade these laws? Let our hearts be full of love, then, and they will\npray. Happy are they who think seriously of the truths of religion;\nbut far more happy are they who feel and love them! We must ardently\ndesire that God will grant us spiritual blessings; and the ardor of\nour wishes must render us fit to receive the blessings. For if we pray\nonly from custom, from fear, in the time of tribulation–- if we honor\nGod only with our lips, while our hearts are far from Him–if we do\nnot feel a strong desire for the success of our prayers–if we feel a\nchilling indifference in approaching Him who is a consuming fire–if\nwe have no zeal for His glory–if we do not feel hatred for sin, and\na thirst for perfection, we can not hope for a blessing upon such\nheartless prayers.",
        "5. We must pray with perseverance. The perfect heart is never weary\nof seeking God. Ought we to complain if God sometimes leaves us to\nobscurity, and doubt, and temptation? Trials purify humble souls, and\nthey serve to expiate the faults of the unfaithful. They confound\nthose who, even in their prayers, have flattered their cowardice and\npride. If an innocent soul, devoted to God, suffer from any secret\ndisturbance, it should be humble, adore the designs of God, and\nredouble its prayers and its fervor. How often do we hear those who\nevery day have to reproach themselves with unfaithfulness toward God\ncomplain that He refuses to answer their prayers! Ought they not to\nacknowledge that it is their sins which have formed a thick cloud\nbetween Heaven and them, and that God has justly hidden Himself from\nthem? How often has He recalled us from our wanderings! How often,\nungrateful as we are, have we been deaf to His voice and insensible to\nHis goodness! He would make us feel that we are blind and miserable\nwhen we forsake Him. He would teach us, by privation, the value of the\nblessings that we have slighted. And shall we not bear our punishment\nwith patience? Who can boast of having done all that he ought to have\ndone; of having repaired all his past errors; of having purified his\nheart, so that he may claim as a right that God should listen to\nhis prayer? Most truly, all our pride, great as it is, would not be\nsufficient to inspire such presumption! If then, the Almightly do not\ngrant our petitions, let us adore His justice, let us be silent, let\nus humble ourselves, and let us pray without ceasing. This humble\nperseverance will obtain from Him what we should never obtain by our\nown merit. It will make us pass happily from darkness to light; for\nknow, says St. Augustine that God is near to us even when He appears\nfar from us.",
        "6. We should pray with a pure intention. We should not mingle in our\nprayers what is false with what is real; what is perishable with what\nis eternal; low and temporal interests with that which concerns our\nsalvation. Do not seek to render God the protector of your self-love\nand ambition, but the promoter of your good desires. You ask for the\ngratification of your passions, or to be delivered from the cross,\nof which He knows you have need. Carry not to the foot of the altar\nirregular desires and indiscreet prayers. Sigh not for vain and\nfleeting pleasures. Open your heart to your Father in heaven, that His\nSpirit may enable you to ask for the true riches. How can He grant\nyou, says St. Augustine, what you do not yourself desire to receive?\nYou pray every day that His will may be done, and that His kingdom may\ncome. How can you utter this prayer with sincerity when you prefer\nyour own will to His, and make His law yield to the vain pretexts with\nwhich your self-love seeks to elude it? Can you make this prayer–you\nwho disturb His reign in your heart by so many impure and vain\ndesires? You, in fine, who fear the coming of His reign, and do not\ndesire that God should grant what you seem to pray for? No! If He, at\nthis moment, were to offer to give you a new heart, and render you\nhumble, and willing to bear the cross, your pride would revolt, and\nyou would not accept the offer; or you would make a reservation in\nfavor of your ruling passion, and try to accommodate your piety to\nyour humor and fancies!",

        "Robert South, who was born in the borough of Hackney, London, England,\nin 1638, attracted wide attention by his vigorous mind and his clear,\nargumentative style in preaching. Some of his sermons are notable\nspecimens of pulpit eloquence. A keen analytical mind, great depth of\nfeeling, and wide range of fancy combined to make him a powerful and\nimpressive speaker. By some critics his style has been considered\nunsurpassed in force and beauty. What he lacked in tenderness was made\nup in masculine strength. He was a born satirist. Henry Rogers said of\nhim: “Of all the English preachers, South seems to furnish, in point\nof style, the truest specimens of pulpit eloquence. His robust\nintellect, his shrewd common sense, his vehement feelings, and a\nfancy always more distinguished by force than by elegance, admirably\nqualified him for a powerful public speaker.” South became prebendary\nof Westminster in 1663, canon at Oxford in 1670, and rector of Islip\nin 1678.

        "Epicurus’s discourse concerning the original of the world is so\nfabulous and ridiculously merry that we may well judge the design of\nhis philosophy to have been pleasure, and not instruction. Aristotle\nheld that it streamed by connatural result and emanation from God, the\ninfinite and eternal Mind, as the light issues from the sun; so that\nthere was no instant of duration assignable of God’s eternal existence\nin which the world did not also coexist. Others held a fortuitous\nconcourse of atoms–but all seem jointly to explode a creation, still\nbeating upon this ground, that the producing something out of nothing\nis impossible and incomprehensible; incomprehensible, indeed, I grant,\nbut not therefore impossible. There is not the least transaction of\nsense and motion in the whole man, but philosophers are at a loss to\ncomprehend, I am sure they are to explain it. Wherefore it is not\nalways rational to measure the truth of an assertion by the standard\nof our apprehension.",
        "But, to bring things even to the bare preception of reason, I\nappeal to any one who shall impartially reflect upon the ideas and\nconceptions of his own mind, whether he doth not find it as easy and\nsuitable to his natural notions to conceive that an infinite Almighty\npower might produce a thing out of nothing, and make that to exist de\nnovo, which did not exist before, as to conceive the world to have\nhad no beginning, but to have existed from eternity, which, were it so\nproper for this place and exercise, I could easily demonstrate to be\nattended with no small train of absurdities. But then, besides\nthat the acknowledging of a creation is safe, and the denial of it\ndangerous and irreligious, and yet not more, perhaps much less,\ndemonstrable than the affirmative; so, over and above, it gives me\nthis advantage, that, let it seem never so strange, uncouth, and\nincomprehensible, the nonplus of my reason will yield a fairer\nopportunity to my faith.",
        "The work that I shall undertake from these words shall be to show what\nthis image of God in man is, and wherein it doth consist. Which I\nshall do these two ways: 1. Negatively, by showing wherein it does not\nconsist. 2. Positively, by showing wherein it does.",
        "For the first of these we are to remove the erroneous opinion of the\nSocinians. They deny that the image of God consisted in any\nhabitual perfections that adorned the soul of Adam, but, as to his\nunderstanding, bring him in void of all notion, a rude, unwritten\nblank; making him to be created as much an infant as others are born;\nsent into the world only to read and to spell out a God in the works\nof creation, to learn by degrees, till at length his understanding\ngrew up to the stature of his body; also without any inherent habits\nof virtue in his will; thus divesting him of all, and stripping him\nof his bare essence; so that all the perfection they allowed his\nunderstanding was aptness and docility, and all that they attributed\nto his will was a possibility to be virtuous.",
        "But wherein, then, according to their opinion, did this image of God\nconsist? Why, in that power and dominion that God gave Adam over the\ncreatures; in that he was vouched His immediate deputy upon earth, the\nviceroy of the creation, and lord-lieutenant of the world. But that\nthis power and dominion is not adequately and formally the image of\nGod, but only a part of it, is clear from hence, because then he that\nhad most of this would have most of God’s image; and consequently\nNimrod had more of it than Noah, Saul than Samuel, the persecutors\nthan the martyrs, and Caesar than Christ Himself, which, to assert,\nis a, blasphemous paradox. And if the image of God is only grandeur,\npower, and sovereignty, certainly we have been hitherto much mistaken\nin our duty, and hereafter are by all means to beware of making\nourselves unlike God by too much self-denial and humility. I am not\nignorant that some may distinguish between a lawful authority and\nactual power, and affirm that God’s image consists only in the former,\nwhich wicked princes, such, as Saul and Nimrod, have not, tho they\npossess the latter. But to this I answer,",
        "1. That the Scripture neither makes nor owns such a distinction, nor\nanywhere asserts that when princes begin to be wicked they cease of\nright to be governors. Add to this, that when God renewed this charter\nof man’s sovereignty over the creatures to Noah and his family we find\nno exception at all, but that Shem stood as fully invested with this\nright as any of his brethren.",
        "2. But, secondly, this savors of something ranker than Socinianism,\neven the tenants of the fifth monarchy, and of sovereignty founded\nonly upon saintship, and therefore fitter to be answered by the judge\nthan the divine, and to receive its confutation at the bar of justice\nthan from the pulpit.",
        "Having now made our way through this false opinion, we are in the next\nplace to lay down positively what this image of God in man is. It is,\nin short, that universal rectitude of all the faculties of the soul,\nby which they stand apt and disposed to their respective offices and\noperations, which will be more fully set forth by taking a distinct\nsurvey of it in the several faculties belonging to the soul.",
        "1. In the understanding. 2. In the will. 3. In the passions or\naffections.",
        "I. And, first, for its noblest faculty, the understanding: it was\nthen sublime, clear, and aspiring–and, as it were, the soul’s upper\nregion, lofty and serene, free from vapors and disturbances of the\ninferior affections. It was the leading, controlling faculty; all the\npassions wore the colors of reason; it was not consul, but dictator.\nDiscourse was then almost as quick as intuition; it was nimble in\nproposing, firm in concluding; it could sooner determine than now it\ncan dispute. Like the sun, it had both light and agility; it knew no\nrest but in motion, no quiet but in activity. It did not so properly\napprehend, as irradiate the object; not so much find, as make things\nintelligible. It did not arbitrate upon the several reports of sense,\nand all the varieties of imagination, like a drowsy judge, not only\nhearing, but also directing their verdict. In sum, it was vegete,\nquick, and lively, open as the day, untainted as the morning, full of\nthe innocence and sprightliness of youth, it gave the soul a bright\nand a full view into all things, and was not only a window, but itself\nthe prospect. Briefly, there is as much difference between the clear\nrepresentations of the understanding then and the obscure discoveries\nthat it makes now as there is between the prospect of a casement and\nof a keyhole.",
        "Now, as there are two great functions of the soul, contemplation and\npractise, according to that general division of objects, some of which\nonly entertain our speculation, others also employ our actions, so the\nunderstanding, with relation to these, not because of any distinction\nin the faculty itself, is accordingly divided into speculative and\npractical; in both of which the image of God was then apparent.",
        "1. For the understanding speculative. There are some general maxims\nand notions in the mind of man which are the rules of discourse and\nthe basis of all philosophy: as, that the same thing can not at the\nsame time be and not be; that the whole is bigger than a part; that\ntwo dimensions, severally equal to a third, must also be equal to one\nanother. Aristotle, indeed, affirms the mind to be at first a mere\ntabula rasa, and that these notions are not ingenit, and imprinted\nby the finger of nature, but by the later and more languid impressions\nof sense, being only the reports of observation, and the result of so\nmany repeated experiments.",
        "(1.) That these notions are universal, and what is universal must\nneeds proceed from some universal, constant principle, the same in all\nparticulars, which here can be nothing else but human nature.",
        "(2.) These can not be infused by observation, because they are the\nrules by which men take their first apprehensions and observations of\nthings, and therefore, in order of nature, must needs precede them;\nas the being of the rule must be before its application to the thing\ndirected by it. From whence it follows that these were notions not\ndescending from us, but born with us, not our offspring, but our\nbrethren; and, as I may so say, such as we were taught without the\nhelp of a teacher.",
        "Now it was Adam’s happiness in the state of innocence to have these\nclear and unsullied. He came into the world a philosopher, which\nsufficiently appeared by his writing the nature of things upon their\nnames; he could view essences in themselves, and read forms without\nthe comment of their respective properties; he could see consequents\nyet dormant in their principles, and effects yet unborn and in the\nwomb of their causes; his understanding could almost pierce into\nfuture contingents; his conjectures improving even to prophecy, or the\ncertainties of prediction; till his fall, it was ignorant of nothing\nbut sin, or at least it rested in the notion, without the smart of the\nexperiment. Could any difficulty have been proposed, the resolution\nwould have been as early as the proposal; it could not have had time\nto settle into doubt. Like a better Archimedes, the issue of all his\ninquiries was a eureka, a eureka, the offspring of his\nbrain without the sweat of his brow. Study was not then a duty,\nnight-watchings were needless, the light of reason wanted not the\nassistance of a candle. This is the doom of fallen man, to labor in\nthe fire, to seek truth in profundo, to exhaust his time and impair\nhis health, and perhaps to spin out his days and himself into one\npitiful, controverted conclusion. There was then no poring, no\nstruggling with memory, no straining for invention; his faculties were\nquick and expedite, they answered without knocking, they were ready\nupon the first summons.",
        "2. The image of God was no less resplendent in that which we call\nman’s practical understanding; namely, that storehouse of the soul in\nwhich are treasured up the rules of action, and the seeds of morality;\nwhere, we must observe, that many who deny all connate notions in the\nspeculative intellect, do yet admit them in this. Now of this sort are\nthese maxims, “That God is to be worshiped, that parents are to be\nhonored, that a man’s word is to be kept,” and the like; which, being\nof universal influence, as to the regulation of the behavior and\nconverse of mankind, are the ground of all virtue and civility, and\nthe foundation of religion.",
        "It was the privilege of Adam innocent, to have these notions also\nfirm and untainted, to carry his monitor in his bosom, his law in his\nheart, and to have such a conscience as might be its own casuist;\nand certainly those actions must needs be regular where there is an\nidentity between the rule and the faculty. His own mind taught him a\ndue dependence upon God, and chalked out to him the just proportions\nand measures of behavior to his fellow creatures. He had no catechism\nbut the creation, needed no study but reflection, read no book but the\nvolume of the world, and that too, not for the rules to work by,\nbut for the objects to work upon. Reason was his tutor, and first\nprinciples his magna moralia. The decalogue of Moses was but a\ntranscript, not an original. All the laws of nations, and wise decrees\nof states, the statutes of Solon, and the twelve tables, were but\na paraphrase upon this standing rectitude of nature, this fruitful\nprinciple of justice, that was ready to run out and enlarge itself\ninto suitable demonstrations upon all emergent objects and occasions.",
        "And this much for the image of God, as it shone in man’s\nunderstanding.",
        "II. Let us in the next place take a view of it as it was stamped upon\nthe will. It is much disputed by divines concerning the power of man’s\nwill to good and evil in the state of innocence: and upon very nice\nand dangerous precipices stand their determinations on either side.\nSome hold that God invested him with a power to stand so that in the\nstrength of that power received, he might, without the auxiliaries of\nany further influence, have determined his will to a full choice\nof good. Others hold that notwithstanding this power, yet it was\nimpossible for him to exert it in any good action without a superadded\nassistance of grace actually determining that power to the certain\nproduction of such an act; so that whereas some distinguish between\nsufficient and effectual grace, they order the matter so as to\nacknowledge some sufficient but what is indeed effected, and\nactually productive of good action. I shall not presume to interpose\ndogmatically in a controversy which I look never to see decided. But\nconcerning the latter of these opinions, I shall only give these two\nremarks:",
        "1. That it seems contrary to the common and natural conceptions of all\nmankind, who acknowledge themselves able and sufficient to do many\nthings which actually they never do.",
        "2. That to assert that God looked upon Adam’s fall as a sin, and\npunished it as such when, without any antecedent sin of his, he\nwithdrew that actual grace from him upon the withdrawing of which\nit was impossible for him not to fall, seems a thing that highly\nreproaches the essential equity and goodness of the divine nature.",
        "Wherefore, doubtless the will of man in the state of innocence had an\nentire freedom, a perfect equipendency and indifference to either part\nof the contradiction, to stand, or not to stand; to accept, or not to\naccept the temptation. I will grant the will of man now to be as much\na slave as any one who will have it, and be only free to sin; that is,\ninstead of a liberty, to have only a licentiousness; yet certainly\nthis is not nature, but chance. We were not born crooked; we learned\nthese windings and turnings of the serpent: and therefore it can not\nbut be a blasphemous piece of ingratitude to ascribe them to God, and\nto make the plague of our nature the condition of our creation.",
        "The will was then ductile and pliant to all the motions of right\nreason; it met the dictates of a clarified understanding half way.\nAnd the active informations of the intellect, filling the passive\nreception of the will, like form closing with matter, grew actuate\ninto a third and distinct perfection of practise; the understanding\nand will never disagreed; for the proposals of the one never thwarted\nthe inclinations of the other. Yet neither did the will servilely\nattend upon the understanding, but as a favorite does upon his prince,\nwhere the service is privilege and preferment; or as Solomon’s\nservants waited upon him: it admired its wisdom, and heard its prudent\ndictates and counsels–both the direction and the reward of its\nobedience. It is indeed the nature of this faculty to follow a\nsuperior guide–to be drawn by the intellect; but then it was drawn\nas a triumphant chariot, which at the same time both follows and\ntriumphs: while it obeyed this, it commanded the other faculties. It\nwas subordinate, not enslaved to the understanding: not as a servant\nto a master, but as a queen to her king, who both acknowledges a\nsubjection and yet retains a majesty.",
        "III. Pass we now downward from man’s intellect and will to the\npassions, which have their residence and situation chiefly in the\nsensitive appetite. For we must know that inasmuch as man is a\ncompound, and mixture of flesh as well as spirit, the soul, during its\nabode in the body, does all things by the mediation of these passions\nand inferior affections. And here the opinion of the Stoics was\nfamous and singular, who looked upon all these as sinful defects\nand irregularities, as so many deviations from right reason, making\npassion to be only another word for perturbation. Sorrow in their\nesteem was a sin scarce to be expiated by another; to pity, was a\nfault; to rejoice, an extravagance; and the apostle’s advice, “to be\nangry and sin not,” was a contradiction in their philosophy. But in\nthis they were constantly outvoted by other sects of philosophers,\nneither for fame nor number less than themselves: so that all\narguments brought against them from divinity would come in by way of\noverplus to their confutation. To us let this be sufficient, that our\nSavior Christ, who took upon Him all our natural infirmities, but none\nof our sinful, has been seen to weep, to be sorrowful, to pity, and\nto be angry: which shows that there might be gall in a dove, passion\nwithout sin, fire without smoke, and motion without disturbance.\nFor it is not bare agitation, but the sediment at the bottom, that\ntroubles and defiles the water; and when we see it windy and dusty,\nthe wind does not (as we used to say) make, but only raise a dust.",
        "Now, tho the schools reduce all the passions to these two heads, the\nconcupiscible and the irascible appetite, yet I shall not tie myself\nto an exact prosecution of them under this division; but at this time,\nleaving both their terms and their method to themselves, consider only\nthe principal and noted passions, from whence we may take an estimate\nof the rest.",
        "And first for the grand leading affection of all, which is love. This\nis the great instrument and engine of nature, the bond and cement\nof society, the spring and spirit of the universe. Love is such an\naffection as can not so properly be said to be in the soul as the soul\nto be in that. It is the whole man wrapt up into one desire; all\nthe powers, vigor, and faculties of the soul abridged into one\ninclination. And it is of that active, restless nature that it must\nof necessity exert itself; and, like the fire to which it is so often\ncompared, it is not a free agent, to choose whether it will heat\nor no, but it streams forth by natural results and unavoidable\nemanations. So that it will fasten upon any inferior, unsuitable\nobject, rather than none at all. The soul may sooner leave off to\nsubsist than to love; and, like the vine, it withers and dies if it\nhas nothing to embrace. Now this affection, in the state of innocence,\nwas happily pitched upon its right object; it flamed up in direct\nfervors of devotion to God, and in collateral emissions of charity to\nits neighbor. It was not then only another and more cleanly name\nfor lust. It had none of those impure heats that both represent and\ndeserve hell. It was a vestal and a virgin fire, and differed as much\nfrom that which usually passes by this name nowadays as the vital heat\nfrom the burning of a fever.",
        "Then for the contrary passion of hatred. This we know is the passion\nof defiance, and there is a kind of aversation and hostility included\nin its very essence and being. But then (if there could have been\nhatred in the world when there was scarce anything odious) it would\nhave acted within the compass of its proper object; like aloes, bitter\nindeed, but wholesome. There would have been no rancor, no hatred of\nour brother: an innocent nature could hate nothing that was innocent.\nIn a word, so great is the commutation that the soul then hated only\nthat which now only it loves, that is, sin.",
        "And if we may bring anger under this head, as being, according to\nsome, a transient hatred, or at least very like it, this also, as\nunruly as now it is, yet then it vented itself by the measures of\nreason. There was no such thing as the transports of malice or the\nviolences of revenge, no rendering evil for evil, when evil was truly\na nonentity and nowhere to be found. Anger, then, was like the sword\nof justice, keen, but innocent and righteous: it did not act like\nfury, then call itself zeal. It always espoused God’s honor, and never\nkindled upon anything but in order to a sacrifice. It sparkled like\nthe coal upon the altar with the fervors of piety, the heats of\ndevotion, the sallies and vibrations of a harmless activity.",
        "In the next place, for the lightsome passion of joy. It was not that\nwhich now often usurps this name; that trivial, vanishing, superficial\nthing, that only gilds the apprehension and plays upon the surface of\nthe soul. It was not the mere crackling of thorns or sudden blaze of\nthe spirits, the exultation of a tickled fancy or a pleased appetite.\nJoy was then a masculine and a severe thing; the recreation of the\njudgment, the jubilee of reason. It was the result of a real good,\nsuitably applied. It commenced upon the solidity of truth and the\nsubstance of fruition. It did not run out in voice or indecent\neruptions, but filled the soul, as God does the universe, silently and\nwithout noise. It was refreshing, but composed, like the pleasantness\nof youth tempered with the gravity of age; or the mirth of a festival\nmanaged with the silence of contemplation.",
        "And, on the other side, for sorrow: Had any loss or disaster made but\nroom for grief, it would have moved according to the severe allowances\nof prudence, and the proportions of the provocation. It would not have\nsallied out into complaint of loudness, nor spread itself upon the\nface, and writ sad stories upon the forehead. No wringing of hands,\nknocking the breast, or wishing oneself unborn; all which are but the\nceremonies of sorrow, the pomp and ostentation of an effeminate grief,\nwhich speak not so much the greatness of the misery as the smallness\nof the mind! Tears may spoil the eyes, but not wash away the\naffliction. Sighs may exhaust the man, but not eject the burden.\nSorrow, then, would have been as silent as thought, as severe as\nphilosophy. It would have been rested in inward senses, tacit\ndislikes; and the whole scene of it been transacted in sad and silent\nreflections....",
        "And, lastly, for the affection of fear: It was then the instrument of\ncaution, not of anxiety; a guard, and not a torment to the breast that\nhad it. It is now indeed an unhappiness, the disease of the soul: it\nflies from a shadow, and makes more dangers than it avoids; it weakens\nthe judgment and betrays the succors of reason: so hard is it to\ntremble and not to err, and to hit the mark with a shaking hand. Then\nit fixt upon Him who is only to be feared, God; and yet with a filial\nfear, which at the same time both fears and loves. It was awe without\namazement, dread without distraction. There was then a beauty even in\nthis very paleness. It was the color of devotion, giving a luster to\nreverence and a gloss to humility.",
        "Thus did the passions then act without any of their present jars,\ncombats, or repugnances; all moving with the beauty of uniformity\nand the stillness of composure; like a well-governed army, not for\nfighting, but for rank and order. I confess the Scripture does not\nexpressly attribute these several endowments to Adam in his first\nestate. But all that I have said, and much more, may be drawn out of\nthat short aphorism, “God made man upright.” And since the opposite\nweaknesses infest the nature of man fallen, if we will be true to the\nrules of contraries we must conclude that these perfections were the\nlot of man innocent....",
        "Having thus surveyed the image of God in the soul of man, we are not\nto omit now those characters of majesty that God imprinted upon the\nbody. He drew some traces of His image upon this also, as much as a\nspiritual substance could be pictured upon a corporeal. As for the\nsect of the Anthropomorphites, who from hence ascribe to God the\nfigure of a man, eyes, hands, feet, and the like, they are too\nridiculous to deserve a confutation. They would seem to draw this\nimpiety from the letter of the Scripture sometimes speaking of God in\nthis manner. Absurdity! as if the mercy of Scripture expressions ought\nto warrant the blasphemy of our opinions; and not rather to show us\nthat God condescends to us only to draw us to Himself; and clothes\nHimself in our likeness only to win us to His own. The practise of\nthe papists is much of the same nature, in their absurd and impious\npicturing of God Almighty; but the wonder in them is the less since\nthe image of a deity may be a proper object for that which is but\nthe image of a religion. But to the purpose: Adam was then no less\nglorious in his externals; he had a beautiful body, as well as an\nimmortal soul. The whole compound was like a well-built temple,\nstately without, and sacred within. The elements were at perfect union\nand agreement in His body; and their contrary qualities served not for\nthe dissolution of the compound, but the variety of the composure.\nGalen, who had no more divinity than what his physic taught him,\nbarely upon the consideration of this so exact frame of the body,\nchallenges any one, upon a hundred years’ study, to find out how any\nthe least fiber, or most minute particle, might be more commodiously\nplaced, either for the advantage of use or comeliness. His stature\nerect, and tending upward to his center; his countenance majestic\nand comely, with the luster of a native beauty that scorned the poor\nassistance of art or the attempts of imitation; His body of so much\nquickness and agility that it did not only contain but also represent\nthe soul; for we might well suppose that where God did deposit so rich\na jewel He would suitably adorn the case. It was a fit workhouse for\nsprightly, vivid faculties to exercise and exert themselves in; a\nfit tabernacle for an immortal soul, not only to dwell in, but to\ncontemplate upon; where it might see the world without travel, it\nbeing a lesser scheme of the creation, nature contracted a little\ncosmography or map of the universe. Neither was the body then subject\nto distempers, to die by piecemeal, and languish under coughs,\ncatarrhs, or consumptions. Adam knew no disease so long as temperance\nfrom the forbidden fruit secured him. Nature was his physician, and\ninnocence and abstinence would have kept him healthful to immortality.",
        "The two great perfections that both adorn and exercise man’s\nunderstanding, are philosophy and religion: for the first of these,\ntake it even among the professors of it where it most flourished, and\nwe shall find the very first notions of common-sense debauched by\nthem. For there have been such as have asserted, “that there is no\nsuch thing in the world as motion: that contradictions may be true.\"\nThere has not been wanting one that has denied snow to be white. Such\na stupidity or wantonness had seized upon the most raised wits that it\nmight be doubted whether the philosophers or the owls of Athens\nwere the quicker sighted. But then for religion; what prodigious,\nmonstrous, misshapen births has the reason of fallen man produced!\nIt is now almost six thousand years that far the greater part of the\nworld has had no other religion but idolatry: and idolatry certainly\nis the first-born of folly, the great and leading paradox, nay, the\nvery abridgment and sum total of all absurdities. For is it not\nstrange that a rational man should worship an ox, nay, the image of an\nox? That he should fawn upon his dog? Bow himself before a cat? Adore\nleeks and garlic, and shed penitential tears at the smell of a deified\nonion? Yet so did the Egyptians, once the famed masters of all arts\nand learning. And to go a little further, we have yet a stronger\ninstance in Isaiah, “A man hews him down a tree in the wood, and a\npart of it he burns, with the residue thereof he maketh a god.” With\none part he furnishes his chimney, with the other his chapel. A\nstrange thing that the fire must first consume this part and then burn\nincense to that. As if there was more divinity in one end of the\nstick than in the other; or, as if he could be graved and painted\nomnipotent, or the nails and the hammer could give it an apotheosis!\nBriefly, so great is the change, so deplorable the degradation of our\nnature, that whereas we bore the image of God, we now retain only the\nimage of man.",
        "In the last place, we learn hence the excellency of Christian\nreligion, in that it is the great and only means that God has\nsanctified and designed to repair the breaches of humanity, to set\nfallen man upon his legs again, to clarify his reason, to rectify his\nwill, and to compose and regulate his affections. The whole business\nof our redemption is, in short, only to rub over the defaced copy of\nthe creation, to reprint God’s image upon the soul, and, as it were,\nto set forth nature in a second and fairer edition; the recovery of\nwhich lost image, as it is God’s pleasure to command, and our duty to\nendeavor, so it is in His power only to effect; to whom be rendered\nand ascribed, as is most due, all praise, might, majesty, and\ndominion, both now and forever more. Amen.",
