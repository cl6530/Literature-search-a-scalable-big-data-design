        "\n   After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging\nfrom the cylinder in which they had come to the earth from\ntheir planet, a kind of fascination paralysed my actions.  I\nremained standing knee-deep in the heather, staring at the\nmound that hid them.  I was a battleground of fear and\ncuriosity.",
        "I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a pas-\nsionate longing to peer into it.  I began walking, therefore, in\na big curve, seeking some point of vantage and continually\nlooking at the sand heaps that hid these new-comers to our\nearth.  Once a leash of thin black whips, like the arms of an\noctopus, flashed across the sunset and was immediately with-\ndrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by joint,\nbearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling\nmotion.  What could be going on there?",
        "Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups\n--one a little crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of\npeople in the direction of Chobham.  Evidently they shared\nmy mental conflict.  There were few near me.  One man I\napproached--he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine,\nthough I did not know his name--and accosted.  But it was\nscarcely a time for articulate conversation.",
        "“What ugly brutes!” he said.  “Good God!  What ugly\nbrutes!”  He repeated this over and over again.",
        "“Did you see a man in the pit?” I said; but he made no\nanswer to that.  We became silent, and stood watching for a\ntime side by side, deriving, I fancy, a certain comfort in one\nanother’s company.  Then I shifted my position to a little\nknoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more of eleva-\ntion and when I looked for him presently he was walking\ntowards Woking.",
        "The sunset faded to twilight before anything further hap-\npened.  The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking,\nseemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.\nThe little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.  There\nwas scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.",
        "It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage,\nand I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to\nrestore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow,\nintermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a move-\nment that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the eve-\nning about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black\nfigures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch,\nand advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin\nirregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its\nattenuated horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards\nthe pit.",
        "Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly\ninto the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the\ngride of wheels.  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of\napples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing\nfrom the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of\nmen, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.",
        "This was the Deputation.  There had been a hasty consulta-\ntion, and since the Martians were evidently, in spite of their\nrepulsive forms, intelligent creatures, it had been resolved to\nshow them, by approaching them with signals, that we too\nwere intelligent.",
        "Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to\nthe left.  It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but\nafterwards I learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were\nwith others in this attempt at communication.  This little\ngroup had in its advance dragged inward, so to speak, the\ncircumference of the now almost complete circle of people,\nand a number of dim black figures followed it at discreet\ndistances.",
        "Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of\nluminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct\npuffs, which drove up, one after the other, straight into the\nstill air.",
        "This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word\nfor it) was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the\nhazy stretches of brown common towards Chertsey, set with\nblack pine trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs\narose, and to remain the darker after their dispersal.  At the\nsame time a faint hissing sound became audible.",
        "Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the\nwhite flag at its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little\nknot of small vertical black shapes upon the black ground.\nAs the green smoke arose, their faces flashed out pallid green,\nand faded again as it vanished.  Then slowly the hissing passed\ninto a humming, into a long, loud, droning noise.  Slowly a\nhumped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam\nof light seemed to flicker out from it.",
        "Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping\nfrom one to another, sprang from the scattered group of men.\nIt was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and\nflashed into white flame.  It was as if each man were suddenly\nand momentarily turned to fire.",
        "Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them\nstaggering and falling, and their supporters turning to\nrun.",
        "I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death\nleaping from man to man in that little distant crowd.  All I\nfelt was that it was something very strange.  An almost noise-\nless and blinding flash of light, and a man fell headlong and\nlay still; and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over them,\npine trees burst into fire, and every dry furze bush became\nwith one dull thud a mass of flames.  And far away towards\nKnaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden\nbuildings suddenly set alight.",
        "It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming\ndeath, this invisible, inevitable sword of heat.  I perceived it\ncoming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and\nwas too astounded and stupefied to stir.  I heard the crackle\nof fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that\nwas as suddenly stilled.  Then it was as if an invisible yet\nintensely heated finger were drawn through the heather\nbetween me and the Martians, and all along a curving line\nbeyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled.\nSomething fell with a crash far away to the left where the\nroad from Woking station opens out on the common.  Forth-\nwith the hissing and humming ceased, and the black, dome-\nlike object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.",
        "All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood\nmotionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light.\nHad that death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably\nhave slain me in my surprise.  But it passed and spared me,\nand left the night about me suddenly dark and un-\nfamiliar.",
        "The undulating common seemed now dark almost to\nblackness, except where its roadways lay grey and pale under\nthe deep blue sky of the early night.  It was dark, and sud-\ndenly void of men.  Overhead the stars were mustering, and\nin the west the sky was still a pale, bright, almost greenish\nblue.  The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came\nout sharp and black against the western afterglow.  The Mar-\ntians and their appliances were altogether invisible, save for\nthat thin mast upon which their restless mirror wobbled.\nPatches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and\nglowed still, and the houses towards Woking station were\nsending up spires of flame into the stillness of the evening\nair.",
        "Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonish-\nment.  The little group of black specks with the flag of white\nhad been swept out of existence, and the stillness of the\nevening, so it seemed to me, had scarcely been broken.",
        "It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless,\nunprotected, and alone.  Suddenly, like a thing falling upon\nme from without, came--fear.",
        "With an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through\nthe heather.",
        "The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not\nonly of the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about\nme.  Such an extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had\nthat I ran weeping silently as a child might do.  Once I had\nturned, I did not dare to look back.",
        "I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was\nbeing played with, that presently, when I was upon the very\nverge of safety, this mysterious death--as swift as the passage\nof light--would leap after me from the pit about the cylinder\nand strike me down.",
