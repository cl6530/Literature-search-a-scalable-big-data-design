        "STATELY, PLUMP BUCK MULLIGAN CAME FROM THE STAIRHEAD, bearing a bowl of\nlather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown,\nungirdled, was sustained gently behind him by the mild morning air. He\nheld the bowl aloft and intoned:",
        "–Introibo Ad Altare Dei.",
        "Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:",
        "–Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!",
        "Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about\nand blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the\nawaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent\ntowards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and\nshaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms\non the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling\nface that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured\nhair, grained and hued like pale oak.",
        "Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered\nthe bowl smartly.",
        "–Back to barracks! he said sternly.",
        "He added in a preacher’s tone:",
        "–For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and\nblood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A\nlittle trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.",
        "He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused\nawhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there\nwith gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered\nthrough the calm.",
        "–Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the\ncurrent, will you?",
        "He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering\nabout his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and\nsullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A\npleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.",
        "–The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!",
        "He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,\nlaughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily\nhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he\npropped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and\nlathered cheeks and neck.",
        "Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.",
        "–My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a\nHellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We\nmust go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty\nquid?",
        "He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:",
        "–Will he come? The jejune jesuit!",
        "Ceasing, he began to shave with care.",
        "–Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.",
        "–Yes, my love?",
        "–How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?",
        "Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.",
        "–God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks\nyou’re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money\nand indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you\nhave the real Oxford manner. He can’t make you out. O, my name for you is\nthe best: Kinch, the knife-blade.",
        "He shaved warily over his chin.",
        "–He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is\nhis guncase?",
        "–A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?",
        "–I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark\nwith a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a\nblack panther. You saved men from drowning. I’m not a hero, however. If\nhe stays on here I am off.",
        "Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down\nfrom his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.",
        "–Scutter! he cried thickly.",
        "He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper\npocket, said:",
        "–Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.",
        "Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a\ndirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.\nThen, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:",
        "–The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.\nYou can almost taste it, can’t you?",
        "He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair\noakpale hair stirring slightly.",
        "–God! he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet\nmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. EPI OINOPA PONTON.\nAh, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the\noriginal. THALATTA! THALATTA! She is our great sweet mother. Come and\nlook.",
        "Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked\ndown on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of\nKingstown.",
        "–Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.",
        "He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s\nface.",
        "–The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That’s why she won’t\nlet me have anything to do with you.",
        "–Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.",
        "–You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked\nyou, Buck Mulligan said. I’m hyperborean as much as you. But to think of\nyour mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for\nher. And you refused. There is something sinister in you ...",
        "He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant\nsmile curled his lips.",
        "–But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest\nmummer of them all!",
        "He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.",
        "Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against\nhis brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.\nPain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in\na dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its\nloose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her\nbreath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of\nwetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a\ngreat sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and\nskyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had stood\nbeside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up\nfrom her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.",
        "Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.",
        "–Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt and\na few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?",
        "–They fit well enough, Stephen answered.",
        "Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.",
        "–The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God\nknows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair\nstripe, grey. You’ll look spiffing in them. I’m not joking, Kinch. You\nlook damn well when you’re dressed.",
        "–Thanks, Stephen said. I can’t wear them if they are grey.",
        "–He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.\nEtiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey\ntrousers.",
        "He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the\nsmooth skin.",
        "Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its\nsmokeblue mobile eyes.",
        "–That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says\nyou have g.p.i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General\nparalysis of the insane!",
        "He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad\nin sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and\nthe edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong\nwellknit trunk.",
        "–Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!",
        "Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a\ncrooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this face\nfor me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.",
        "–I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her\nall right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead\nhim not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.",
        "Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.",
        "–The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If\nWilde were only alive to see you!",
        "Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:",
        "–It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked looking-glass of a servant.",
        "Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him\nround the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had\nthrust them.",
        "–It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. God\nknows you have more spirit than any of them.",
        "Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The\ncold steelpen.",
        "–Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs\nand touch him for a guinea. He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re\nnot a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or\nsome bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only work\ntogether we might do something for the island. Hellenise it.",
        "Cranly’s arm. His arm.",
        "–And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only one\nthat knows what you are. Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up\nyour nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll bring\ndown Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive\nKempthorpe.",
        "Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms. Palefaces:\nthey hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall\nexpire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit\nribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the\ntable, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the\ntailor’s shears. A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade. I don’t want\nto be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!",
        "Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf\ngardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower on\nthe sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.",
        "To ourselves ... new paganism ... omphalos.",
        "–Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except at\nnight.",
        "–Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m\nquite frank with you. What have you against me now?",
        "They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the\nwater like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.",
        "–Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.",
        "–Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.",
        "He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,\nfanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of\nanxiety in his eyes.",
        "Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:",
        "–Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s\ndeath?",
        "Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:",
        "–What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas and\nsensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?",
        "–You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get\nmore hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.\nShe asked you who was in your room.",
        "–Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.",
        "–You said, Stephen answered, O, IT’S ONLY DEDALUS WHOSE MOTHER IS\nBEASTLY DEAD.",
        "A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck\nMulligan’s cheek.",
        "–Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?",
        "He shook his constraint from him nervously.",
        "–And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw\nonly your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and\nRichmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It’s a beastly\nthing and nothing else. It simply doesn’t matter. You wouldn’t kneel down\nto pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Because\nyou have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong\nway. To me it’s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not\nfunctioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups\noff the quilt. Humour her till it’s over. You crossed her last wish in\ndeath and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired\nmute from Lalouette’s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didn’t mean to\noffend the memory of your mother.",
        "He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds\nwhich the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:",
        "–I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.",
        "–Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.",
        "–Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.",
        "Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.",
        "–O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.",
        "He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,\ngazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew\ndim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt\nthe fever of his cheeks.",
        "A voice within the tower called loudly:",
        "–Are you up there, Mulligan?",
        "–I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.",
        "He turned towards Stephen and said:",
        "–Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch,\nand come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.",
        "His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level\nwith the roof:",
        "–Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the\nmoody brooding.",
        "His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the\nstairhead:",
        "    AND NO MORE TURN ASIDE AND BROOD\n   UPON LOVE’S BITTER MYSTERY\n   FOR FERGUS RULES THE BRAZEN CARS.",
        "Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the\nstairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of\nwater whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the\ndim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the\nharpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words\nshimmering on the dim tide.",
        "A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in\ndeeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus’ song:\nI sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her door\nwas open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went to\nher bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words,\nStephen: love’s bitter mystery.",
        "Where now?",
        "Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a\ngaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny\nwindow of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the\npantomime of TURKO THE TERRIBLE and laughed with others when he sang:",
        "    I AM THE BOY\n    THAT CAN ENJOY\n    INVISIBILITY.",
        "Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.",
        "    and No More Turn Aside and Brood.",
        "Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his\nbrooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had\napproached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,\nroasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely\nfingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s\nshirts.",
        "In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its\nloose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,\nbent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.",
        "Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me\nalone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured\nface. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on\ntheir knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. LILIATA RUTILANTIUM TE\nCONFESSORUM TURMA CIRCUMDET: IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM CHORUS EXCIPIAT.",
        "Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!",
        "No, mother! Let me be and let me live.",
        "–Kinch ahoy!",
        "Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the\nstaircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,\nheard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.",
        "–Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is\napologising for waking us last night. It’s all right.",
        "–I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.",
        "–Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our\nsakes.",
        "His head disappeared and reappeared.",
        "–I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch\nhim for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.",
        "–I get paid this morning, Stephen said.",
        "–The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.",
        "–If you want it, Stephen said.",
        "–Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have a\nglorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns.",
        "He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of\ntune with a Cockney accent:",
        "    O, WON’T WE HAVE A MERRY TIME,\n    DRINKING WHISKY, BEER AND WINE!\n    ON CORONATION,\n    CORONATION DAY!\n    O, WON’T WE HAVE A MERRY TIME\n    ON CORONATION DAY!",
        "Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,\nforgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there\nall day, forgotten friendship?",
        "He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,\nsmelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. So\nI carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yet\nthe same. A servant too. A server of a servant.",
        "In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form\nmoved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its\nyellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor\nfrom the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of\ncoalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.",
        "–We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?",
        "Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the\nhammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open\nthe inner doors.",
        "–Have you the key? a voice asked.",
        "–Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!",
        "He howled, without looking up from the fire:",
        "–Kinch!",
        "–It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.",
        "The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set\najar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the doorway,\nlooking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down\nto wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he\ncarried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down\nheavily and sighed with relief.",
        "–I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when ... But, hush! Not a\nword more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines,\ncome in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.\nWhere’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.",
        "Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from\nthe locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.",
        "–What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.",
        "–We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in the\nlocker.",
        "–O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove\nmilk.",
        "Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:",
        "–That woman is coming up with the milk.",
        "–The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his\nchair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, I\ncan’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.",
        "He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates,\nsaying:",
        "–In Nomine Patris Et Filii Et Spiritus Sancti.",
        "Haines sat down to pour out the tea.",
        "–I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do\nmake strong tea, don’t you?",
        "Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s\nwheedling voice:",
        "–When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I\nmakes water I makes water.",
        "–By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.",
        "Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:",
        "–SO I DO, MRS CAHILL, says she. BEGOB, MA’AM, says Mrs Cahill, GOD SEND\nYOU DON’T MAKE THEM IN THE ONE POT.",
        "He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled\non his knife.",
        "–That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines\nof text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of\nDundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.",
        "He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his\nbrows:",
        "–Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of\nin the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?",
        "–I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.",
        "–Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?",
        "–I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the\nMabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.",
        "Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.",
        "–Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and\nblinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!",
        "Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened\nrasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:",
        "  –FOR OLD MARY ANN\n    SHE DOESN’T CARE A DAMN.\n    BUT, HISING UP HER PETTICOATS ...",
        "He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.",
        "The doorway was darkened by an entering form.",
        "–The milk, sir!",
        "–Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.",
        "An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.",
        "–That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.",
        "–To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!",
        "Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.",
        "–The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of\nthe collector of prepuces.",
        "–How much, sir? asked the old woman.",
        "–A quart, Stephen said.",
        "He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white\nmilk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a\ntilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a\nmessenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.\nCrouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her\ntoadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed\nabout her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old\nwoman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an\nimmortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common\ncuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid,\nwhether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.",
        "–It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.",
        "–Taste it, sir, she said.",
        "He drank at her bidding.",
        "–If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat\nloudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten\nguts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with\ndust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.",
        "–Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.",
        "–I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.",
        "–Look at that now, she said.",
        "Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice\nthat speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she\nslights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is\nof her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s\nlikeness, the serpent’s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids her be\nsilent with wondering unsteady eyes.",
        "–Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.",
        "–Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.",
        "Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.",
        "–Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?",
        "–I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the\nwest, sir?",
        "–I am an Englishman, Haines answered.",
        "–He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish\nin Ireland.",
        "–Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the\nlanguage myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.",
        "–Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill\nus out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?",
        "–No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the\nmilkcan on her forearm and about to go.",
        "Haines said to her:",
        "–Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?",
        "Stephen filled again the three cups.",
        "–Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at\ntwopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three\nmornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a\nshilling and one and two is two and two, sir.",
        "Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly\nbuttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his\ntrouser pockets.",
        "–Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.",
        "Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick\nrich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his\nfingers and cried:",
        "–A miracle!",
        "He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:",
        "–Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.",
        "Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.",
        "–We’ll owe twopence, he said.",
        "–Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning,\nsir.",
        "She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:",
        "  –HEART OF MY HEART, WERE IT MORE,\n    MORE WOULD BE LAID AT YOUR FEET.",
        "He turned to Stephen and said:",
        "–Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring\nus back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland\nexpects that every man this day will do his duty.",
        "–That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your\nnational library today.",
        "–Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.",
        "He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:",
        "–Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?",
        "Then he said to Haines:",
        "–The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.",
        "–All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey\ntrickle over a slice of the loaf.",
        "Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the\nloose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:",
        "–I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.",
        "Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.\nConscience. Yet here’s a spot.",
        "–That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol\nof Irish art is deuced good.",
        "Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth\nof tone:",
        "–Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.",
        "–Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just\nthinking of it when that poor old creature came in.",
        "–Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.",
        "Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the\nhammock, said:",
        "–I don’t know, I’m sure.",
        "He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and\nsaid with coarse vigour:",
        "–You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?",
        "–Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the\nmilkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.",
        "–I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along\nwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.",
        "–I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.",
        "Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.",
        "–From me, Kinch, he said.",
        "In a suddenly changed tone he added:",
        "–To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they\nare good for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Let\nus get out of the kip.",
        "He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying\nresignedly:",
        "–Mulligan is stripped of his garments.",
        "He emptied his pockets on to the table.",
        "–There’s your snotrag, he said.",
        "And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,\nchiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and\nrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,\nwe’ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green\nboots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I\ncontradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of\nhis talking hands.",
        "–And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.",
        "Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the\ndoorway:",
        "–Are you coming, you fellows?",
        "–I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,\nKinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out with\ngrave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:",
        "–And going forth he met Butterly.",
        "Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out\nand, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and\nlocked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.",
        "At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:",
        "–Did you bring the key?",
        "–I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.",
        "He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy\nbathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.",
        "–Down, sir! How dare you, sir!",
        "Haines asked:",
        "–Do you pay rent for this tower?",
        "–Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.",
        "–To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.",
        "They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:",
        "–Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?",
        "–Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on\nthe sea. But ours is the OMPHALOS.",
        "–What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.",
        "–No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas\nand the fifty-five reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I have\na few pints in me first.",
        "He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his\nprimrose waistcoat:",
        "–You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?",
        "–It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.",
        "–You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?",
        "–Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.\nIt’s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is\nShakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own\nfather.",
        "–What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?",
        "Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in\nloose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:",
        "–O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!",
        "–We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is\nrather long to tell.",
        "Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.",
        "–The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.",
        "–I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower\nand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. THAT BEETLES O’ER\nHIS BASE INTO THE SEA, ISN’T IT?",
        "Buck Mulligan turned suddenly. for an instant towards Stephen but did not\nspeak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap\ndusty mourning between their gay attires.",
        "–It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.",
        "Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.\nThe seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the\nsmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking\nby the Muglins.",
        "–I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.\nThe Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the\nFather.",
        "Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at\nthem, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had\nsuddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a\ndoll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began\nto chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:",
        "  –I’M THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD.\n    MY MOTHER’S A JEW, MY FATHER’S A BIRD.\n    WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE.\n    SO HERE’S TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARY.",
        "He held up a forefinger of warning.",
        "  –IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMN’T DIVINE\n    HE’LL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN I’M MAKING THE WINE\n    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN\n    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAIN.",
        "He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward\nto a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or\nwings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:",
        "  –GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE! WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID\n    AND TELL TOM, DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD.\n    WHAT’S BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY\n    AND OLIVET’S BREEZY ... GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE!",
        "He capered before them down towards the forty-foot hole, fluttering his\nwinglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind\nthat bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.",
        "Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and\nsaid:",
        "–We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not a\nbeliever myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of\nit somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?",
        "–The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.",
        "–O, Haines said, you have heard it before?",
        "–Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.",
        "–You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in the\nnarrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a\npersonal God.",
        "–There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.",
        "Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green\nstone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.",
        "–Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.",
        "Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his\nsidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang\nit open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk\ntowards Stephen in the shell of his hands.",
        "–Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or\nyou don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a\npersonal God. You don’t stand for that, I suppose?",
        "–You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible\nexample of free thought.",
        "He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.\nIts ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. My\nfamiliar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along\nthe path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants\nthat key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him\nthe key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.",
        "–After all, Haines began ...",
        "Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not\nall unkind.",
        "–After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your\nown master, it seems to me.",
        "–I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.",
        "–Italian? Haines said.",
        "A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.",
        "–And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.",
        "–Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?",
        "–The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and\nthe holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.",
        "Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.",
        "–I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think\nlike that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather\nunfairly. It seems history is to blame.",
        "The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of\ntheir brazen bells: ET UNAM SANCTAM CATHOLICAM ET APOSTOLICAM ECCLESIAM:\nthe slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts,\na chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope\nMarcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and\nbehind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and\nmenaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry:\nPhotius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius,\nwarring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the\nFather, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle\nAfrican heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own\nSon. Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.\nIdle mockery. The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a\nmenace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the\nchurch, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with\ntheir lances and their shields.",
        "Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. ZUT! NOM DE DIEU!",
        "–Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. I\ndon’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.\nThat’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.",
        "Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.",
        "–She’s making for Bullock harbour.",
        "The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.",
        "–There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way\nwhen the tide comes in about one. It’s nine days today.",
        "The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for\na swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.\nHere I am.",
        "They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on\na stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. A\nyoung man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his\ngreen legs in the deep jelly of the water.",
        "–Is the brother with you, Malachi?",
        "–Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.",
        "–Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young\nthing down there. Photo girl he calls her.",
        "–Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.",
        "Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near\nthe spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, water\nglistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling\nover his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging\nloincloth.",
        "Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines\nand Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips\nand breastbone.",
        "–Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of\nrock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.",
        "–Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.",
        "–Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?",
        "–Yes.",
        "–Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with\nmoney.",
        "–Is she up the pole?",
        "–Better ask Seymour that.",
        "–Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.",
        "He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying\ntritely:",
        "–Redheaded women buck like goats.",
        "He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.",
        "–My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I’m the UBERMENSCH. Toothless Kinch\nand I, the supermen.",
        "He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his\nclothes lay.",
        "–Are you going in here, Malachi?",
        "–Yes. Make room in the bed.",
        "The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the\nmiddle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a\nstone, smoking.",
        "–Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.",
        "–Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.",
        "Stephen turned away.",
        "–I’m going, Mulligan, he said.",
        "–Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.",
        "Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped\nclothes.",
        "–And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.",
        "Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck\nMulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:",
        "–He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake\nZarathustra.",
        "His plump body plunged.",
        "–We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path\nand smiling at wild Irish.",
        "Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.",
        "–The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.",
        "–Good, Stephen said.",
        "He walked along the upwardcurving path.",
        "    LILIATA RUTILANTIUM.\n    TURMA CIRCUMDET.\n    IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM.",
        "The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will\nnot sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.",
        "A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning\nthe curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a\nseal’s, far out on the water, round.",
        "Usurper.",
        "–You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?",
        "–Tarentum, sir.",
        "–Very good. Well?",
        "–There was a battle, sir.",
        "–Very good. Where?",
        "The boy’s blank face asked the blank window.",
        "Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as\nmemory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings of\nexcess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling\nmasonry, and time one livid final flame. What’s left us then?",
        "–I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.",
        "–Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred\nbook.",
        "–Yes, sir. And he said: ANOTHER VICTORY LIKE THAT AND WE ARE DONE FOR.",
        "That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a\nhill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,\nleaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.",
        "–You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?",
        "–End of Pyrrhus, sir?",
        "–I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.",
        "–Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?",
        "A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. He curled them\nbetween his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to\nthe tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy’s breath. Welloff people, proud\nthat their eldest son was in the navy. Vico road, Dalkey.",
        "–Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.",
        "All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round at\nhis classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh more\nloudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.",
        "–Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book,\nwhat is a pier.",
        "–A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a\nbridge. Kingstown pier, sir.",
        "Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench\nwhispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. All.\nWith envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their likes:\ntheir breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering\nin the struggle.",
        "–Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.",
        "The words troubled their gaze.",
        "–How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.",
        "For Haines’s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild\ndrink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A\njester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a\nclement master’s praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly\nfor the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other too\noften heard, their land a pawnshop.",
        "Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not\nbeen knifed to death. They are not to be thought away.

Or was that only possible which came to pass?\nWeave, weaver of the wind.",

        "–O, do, sir. A ghoststory.",
        "–Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.",
        "–WEEP NO MORE, Comyn said.",
        "–Go on then, Talbot.",
        "–And the story, sir?",
        "–After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.",

Fed and feeding brains\nabout me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in\nmy mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of\nbrightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of\nthought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the\nsoul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of\nforms.",

        "    THE COCK CREW,\n    THE SKY WAS BLUE:\n    THE BELLS IN HEAVEN\n    WERE STRIKING ELEVEN.\n    ’TIS TIME FOR THIS POOR SOUL\n    TO GO TO HEAVEN.",
        "What is that?",
        "–What, sir?",
        "–Again, sir. We didn’t hear.",
        "Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence\nCochrane said:",
        "–What is it, sir? We give it up.",
        "Stephen, his throat itching, answered:",
        "–The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.",
        "He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries\nechoed dismay.",
        "A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:",
        "–Hockey!",
        "They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.\nQuickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks\nand clamour of their boots and tongues.",
        "Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an\nopen copybook. His thick hair and scraggy neck gave witness of\nunreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.\nOn his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped,\nrecent and damp as a snail’s bed.",
        "He held out his copybook. The word SUMS was written on the\nheadline. Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature\nwith blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.",
        "–Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to\nyou, sir.",
        "Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.",
        "–Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.",
        "–Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to\ncopy them off the board, sir.",
        "–Can you do them. yourself? Stephen asked.",
        "–No, sir.",
        "Ugly and futile: lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s\nbed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.\nBut for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a\nsquashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained from\nher own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life? His mother’s\nprostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode. She was no\nmore: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of\nrosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampled\nunderfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul gone to heaven:\nand on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur,\nwith merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the\nearth, listened, scraped and scraped.",
        "Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by\nalgebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather. Sargent peered\naskance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the\nlumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.",
        "Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery\nof their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,\ntraverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from\nthe world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and\nmovement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the\nworld, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not\ncomprehend.",
        "–Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?",
        "–Yes, sir.",
        "In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a\nword of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue\nof shame flickering behind his dull skin. AMOR MATRIS: subjective and\nobjective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him\nand hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.",
        "Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My\nchildhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or\nlightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony\nsit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their\ntyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.",
        "The sum was done.",
        "–It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.",
        "–Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.",
        "He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his\ncopybook back to his bench.",
        "–You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as\nhe followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.",
        "–Yes, sir.",
        "In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.",
        "–Sargent!",
        "–Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.",
        "He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the\nscrappy field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams\nand Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.\nWhen he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to\nhim. He turned his angry white moustache.",
        "–What is it now? he cried continually without listening.",
        "–Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.",
        "–Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore\norder here.",
        "And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice\ncried sternly:",
        "–What is the matter? What is it now?",
        "Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms\nclosed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed\nhead.",
        "Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded\nleather of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As\nit was in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart\ncoins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their\nspooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to\nall the gentiles: world without end.",
        "A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his\nrare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.",
        "–First, our little financial settlement, he said.",
        "He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It\nslapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid\nthem carefully on the table.",
        "–Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.",
        "And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen’s embarrassed hand\nmoved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money\ncowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and\nthis, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure,\nhollow shells.",
        "A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.",
        "–Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.\nThese are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is for\nshillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.",
        "He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.",
        "–Three twelve, he said. I think you’ll find that’s right.",
        "–Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy\nhaste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.",
        "–No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.",
        "Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols\ntoo of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed\nand misery.",
        "–Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You’ll pull it out somewhere\nand lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You’ll find them very\nhandy.",
        "Answer something.",
        "–Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.",
        "The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three\ntimes now. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this\ninstant if I will.",
        "–Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don’t\nknow yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as I\nhave. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say?\nPUT BUT MONEY IN THY PURSE.",
        "–Iago, Stephen murmured.",
        "He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.",
        "–He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes,\nbut an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do\nyou know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an\nEnglishman’s mouth?",
        "The seas’ ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems\nhistory is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.",
        "–That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.",
        "–Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That’s not English. A French Celt said that. He\ntapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.",
        "–I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. I PAID\nMY WAY.",
        "Good man, good man.",
        "–I PAID MY WAY. I NEVER BORROWED A SHILLING IN MY LIFE. Can you feel\nthat? I OWE NOTHING. Can you?",
        "Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.\nCurran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.\nTemple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob\nReynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five\nweeks’ board. The lump I have is useless.",
        "–For the moment, no, Stephen answered.",
        "Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.",
        "–I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it. We\nare a generous people but we must also be just.",
        "–I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.",
        "Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at\nthe shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs: Albert Edward, prince of\nWales.",
        "–You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. I\nsaw three generations since O’Connell’s time. I remember the famine\nin ’46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the\nunion twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your\ncommunion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.",
        "Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in\nArmagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and\narmed, the planters’ covenant. The black north and true blue bible.\nCroppies lie down.",
        "Stephen sketched a brief gesture.",
        "–I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But I\nam descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are all\nIrish, all kings’ sons.",
        "–Alas, Stephen said.",
        "–PER VIAS RECTAS, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for it\nand put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.",
        "    LAL THE RAL THE RA\n    THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN.",
        "A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!\nSoft day, your honour! ... Day! ... Day! ... Two topboots jog dangling\non to Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.",
        "–That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,\nwith some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.\nSit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.",
        "He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and\nread off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.",
        "–Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, THE DICTATES OF COMMON\nSENSE. Just a moment.",
        "He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his\nelbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard\nslowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.",
        "Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.\nFramed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their\nmeek heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ Repulse, the duke of\nWestminster’s Shotover, the duke of Beaufort’s Ceylon, PRIX DE PARIS,\n1866. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds,\nbacking king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.",
        "–Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of this\nallimportant question ...",
        "Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among\nthe mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and\nreek of the canteen, over the motley slush. Fair Rebel! Fair Rebel! Even\nmoney the favourite: ten to one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we\nhurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the\nmeatfaced woman, a butcher’s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.",
        "Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.",
        "Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a\nmedley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who\nseems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by\nshock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the\nslain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.",
        "–Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.",
        "He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.",
        "–I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It’s about the\nfoot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two opinions\non the matter.",
        "May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of LAISSEZ FAIRE\nwhich so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old\nindustries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.\nEuropean conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the\nchannel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of\nagriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who\nwas no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.",
        "–I don’t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.",
        "Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch’s preparation. Serum and\nvirus. Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor’s horses at\nMurzsteg, lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price.\nCourteous offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant\nquestion. In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking\nyou for the hospitality of your columns.",
        "–I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the\nnext outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be\ncured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is\nregularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They offer\nto come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the department.\nNow I’m going to try publicity. I am surrounded by difficulties,\nby ... intrigues by ... backstairs influence by ...",
        "He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.",
        "–Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the\njews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the\nsigns of a nation’s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s\nvital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as we are\nstanding here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.\nOld England is dying.",
        "He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a\nbroad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.",
        "–Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.",
        "    THE HARLOT’S CRY FROM STREET TO STREET\n    SHALL WEAVE OLD ENGLAND’S WINDINGSHEET.",
        "His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in\nwhich he halted.",
        "–A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or\ngentile, is he not?",
        "–They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see\nthe darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the\nearth to this day.",
        "On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting\nprices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,\nuncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk\nhats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full\nslow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew\nthe rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain patience\nto heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard heaped by the\nroadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their years of\nwandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.",
        "–Who has not? Stephen said.",
        "–What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.",
        "He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell\nsideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.",
        "–History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.",
        "From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.\nWhat if that nightmare gave you a back kick?",
        "–The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human\nhistory moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.",
        "Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:",
        "–That is God.",
        "Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!",
        "–What? Mr Deasy asked.",
        "–A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.",
        "Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose\ntweaked between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.",
        "–I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and\nmany sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no\nbetter than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years\nthe Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangers\nto our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman, O’Rourke, prince of\nBreffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures but\nnot the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my days. But I will\nfight for the right till the end.",
        "    FOR ULSTER WILL FIGHT\n    AND ULSTER WILL BE RIGHT.",
        "Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.",
        "–Well, sir, he began ...",
        "–I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at\nthis work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am\nwrong.",
        "–A learner rather, Stephen said.",
        "And here what will you learn more?",
        "Mr Deasy shook his head.",
        "–Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great\nteacher.",
        "Stephen rustled the sheets again.",
        "–As regards these, he began.",
        "–Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them\npublished at once.",
        "Telegraph. Irish Homestead.",
        "–I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editors\nslightly.",
        "–That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,\nM.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the\nCity Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You see\nif you can get it into your two papers. What are they?",
        "–The Evening Telegraph ...",
        "–That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to\nanswer that letter from my cousin.",
        "–Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.\nThank you.",
        "–Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I like\nto break a lance with you, old as I am.",
        "–Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.",
        "He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the\ntrees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.\nThe lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:\ntoothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub\nme a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.",
        "–Mr Dedalus!",
        "Running after me. No more letters, I hope.",
        "–Just one moment.",
        "–Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.",
        "Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.",
        "–I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of\nbeing the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that?\nNo. And do you know why?",
        "He frowned sternly on the bright air.",
        "–Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.",
        "–Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.",
        "A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a\nrattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his\nlifted arms waving to the air.",
        "–She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he\nstamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That’s why.",
        "On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung\nspangles, dancing coins.",
        "Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought\nthrough my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and\nseawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust:\ncoloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he\nwas aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his\nsconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, MAESTRO\nDI COLOR CHE SANNO. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane,\nadiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if\nnot a door. Shut your eyes and see.",
        "Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and\nshells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time.

        "Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He\nliked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,\nliverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes. Most of all he\nliked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of\nfaintly scented urine.",
        "Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting\nher breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the\nkitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel\na bit peckish.",

        "–Mkgnao!",
        "–O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.",

        "He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped\nthree times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they\ncan’t mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or\nkind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.",
        "He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this\ndrouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for a\nmutton kidney at Buckley’s.

To\nlap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him.\nNo.",
        "On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by\nthe bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter\nshe likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.",
        "He said softly in the bare hall:",
        "–I’m going round the corner. Be back in a minute.",
        "And when he had heard his voice say it he added:",

        "–Mn.",
        "No. She didn’t want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as\nshe turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. Must\nget those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar. Forgotten any\nlittle Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for it. Old style.\nAh yes! of course. Bought it at the governor’s auction. Got a short\nknock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At Plevna that\nwas. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it. Still he had brains\nenough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.",

Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.\nThe sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s high\ngrade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip of\npaper. Quite safe.",
        "On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there. In\nthe trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky wardrobe. No\nuse disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled the\nhalldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped\ngently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I come\nback anyhow.",
        "He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number\nseventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church. Be a\nwarm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black\nconducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn’t go in\nthat light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as\nhe walked in happy warmth. Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our\ndaily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.\nMakes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at\ndawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day’s march on him. Keep\nit up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand,\nstrange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old\nTweedy’s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander\nthrough awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet\nshops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled\npipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel,\nsherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well, meet\nhim. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the pillars:\npriest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal, the\nevening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from her\ndoorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High wall:\nbeyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly’s new\ngarters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of those instruments what do\nyou call them: dulcimers. I pass.",
        "Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track\nof the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What\nArthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the FREEMAN leader: a\nhomerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank\nof Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sun\nrising up in the north-west.",
        "He approached Larry O’Rourke’s. From the cellar grating floated up the\nflabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out\nwhiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the end\nof the city traffic. For instance M’Auley’s down there: n. g. as\nposition. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from\nthe cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.",
        "Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an\nad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my\nbold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the\naproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him off\nto a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I’m going to tell\nyou? What’s that, Mr O’Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians, they’d\nonly be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese.",
        "Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor\nDignam, Mr O’Rourke.",
        "Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the\ndoorway:",
        "–Good day, Mr O’Rourke.",
        "–Good day to you.",
        "–Lovely weather, sir.",
        "–’Tis all that.",
        "Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county\nLeitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.

Off the drunks perhaps. Put down three\nand carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs. On\nthe wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the town\ntravellers.

        "How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels\nof stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint\nJoseph’s National school. Brats’ clamour.

        "He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,\npolonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by.

        "A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He stood\nby the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling the\nitems from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and a\nhalf of Denny’s sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Woods his\nname is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood. No followers\nallowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. She\ndoes whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.",
        "The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with\nblotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.",
        "He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at\nKinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter\nsanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round it,\nblurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting: read it\nnearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A\nyoung white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing\nin their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in\nhobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a\nripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their\nhands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his\nwill, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging, whack by\nwhack by whack.",
        "The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime\nsausages and made a red grimace.",

        "–Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,\nplease?",
        "Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went\nslowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the\nmorning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood\noutside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He sighed\ndown his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails\ntoo. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The sting of\ndisregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For another: a\nconstable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. They like them sizeable.\nPrime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I’m lost in the wood.",
        "–Threepence, please.",
        "His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.\nThen it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them on\nthe rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc\nby disc, into the till.",
        "–Thank you, sir. Another time.",
        "A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze\nafter an instant. No: better not: another time.",

        "No sign. Gone. What matter?",
        "He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:\nplanters’ company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government\nand plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel and\nconstruction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa. You\npay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives,\noranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial\nirrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name entered\nfor life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the\nbalance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.",
        "Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.",
        "He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered\nolivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in\njars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows\nthe taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons\ntoo. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade. And Mastiansky\nwith the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citron’s\nbasketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to\nthe nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild\nperfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too,\nMoisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times. Must\nbe without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar,\nMediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap\nticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled\ndungarees. There’s whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn’t see. Chap\nyou know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that Norwegian\ncaptain’s. Wonder if I’ll meet him today. Watering cart. To provoke the\nrain. On earth as it is in heaven.",
        "A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.",
        "No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead\nsea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those\nwaves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it\nraining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead\nnames. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the\noldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s, clutching a\nnaggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over all\nthe earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born\neverywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old\nwoman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.",
        "Desolation.",
        "Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned\ninto Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins,\nchilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here\nnow. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of\nthe bed. Must begin again those Sandow’s exercises. On the hands down.\nBlotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that?\nValuation is only twenty-eight.

        "–Poldy!",
        "Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm\nyellow twilight towards her tousled head.",
        "–Who are the letters for?",
        "He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.",
        "–A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And a\nletter for you.",
        "He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her\nknees.",
        "–Do you want the blind up?",
        "Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her\nglance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.",
        "–That do? he asked, turning.",
        "She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.",

        "–What?",
        "–Scald the teapot.",
        "On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and\nrinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the\nkettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off\nthe kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump\nof butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed\nhungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won’t mouse. Say they\nwon’t eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her\nand dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He\nsprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.",
        "Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks:\nnew tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s\nseaside girls.",
        "The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown",
        "Derby, smiling. Silly Milly’s birthday gift. Only five she was then. No,\nwait: four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of\nfolded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.",

The night Milly brought it into the\nparlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we laughed.\nSex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.",
        "He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the\nteapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it?\nBread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it\nupstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.",
        "Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on\nthe chair by the bedhead.",
        "–What a time you were! she said.",
        "She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on\nthe pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft\nbubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder. The warmth of\nher couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea\nshe poured.",
        "A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the act\nof going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.",

        "–No: that book.",
        "Other stocking. Her petticoat.",
        "–It must have fell down, she said.",
        "He felt here and there. VOGLIO E NON VORREI. Wonder if she pronounces\nthat right: VOGLIO. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped and\nlifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the\norangekeyed chamberpot.",

        "He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes\nagainst the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping\nhastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs. Pungent smoke shot\nup in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the\nfork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.\nOnly a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the\nscanty brown gravy trickle over it.",

Then he put a forkful\ninto his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Done\nto a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one\nin the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about some young\nstudent and a picnic?

And past the sailors’ home. He turned\nfrom the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.\nBy Brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal\nlinked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of eczema on\nher forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. Tell him\nif he smokes he won’t grow. O let him! His life isn’t such a bed of\nroses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da. Slack\nhour: won’t be many there. He crossed Townsend street, passed the\nfrowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. And past\nNichols’ the undertaker. At eleven it is. Time enough. Daresay Corny\nKelleher bagged the job for O’Neill’s. Singing with his eyes shut. Corny.\nMet her once in the park. In the dark.

Must get some from Tom\nKernan. Couldn’t ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read\nblandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his\nright hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning.\nUnder their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather\nheadband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down\ninto the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the\nheadband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.",

Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in DOLCE FAR NIENTE, not\ndoing a hand’s turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too hot to\nquarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of idleness. The air\nfeeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Sensitive plants.\nWaterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air. Walk on\nroseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where was the chap I\nsaw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his\nback, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn’t sink if you tried: so\nthick with salt. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the\nbody in the water is equal to the weight of the what? Or is it the volume\nis equal to the weight? It’s a law something like that. Vance in High\nschool cracking his fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum.\nCracking curriculum.

There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he’s a\ngrenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats.\nToo showy. That must be why the women go after them. Uniform. Easier to\nenlist and drill. Maud Gonne’s letter about taking them off O’Connell\nstreet at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith’s paper is on\nthe same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or\nhalfseasover empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. Eyes front.\nMark time. Table: able. Bed: ed.

His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger\nfelt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.\nWomen will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think. His fingers drew forth the\nletter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something\npinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.",

Careless stand of her with her\nhands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty creature at the polo\nmatch. Women all for caste till you touch the spot. Handsome is and\nhandsome does.

        "I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry\nyou did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am\nawfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called\nyou naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me\nwhat is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home you\npoor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you. Please\ntell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the beautiful name you\nhave. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you so often you have no\nidea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you. I feel so\nbad about. Please write me a long letter and tell me more. Remember if you\ndo not I will punish you. So now you know what I will do to you, you\nnaughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to meet you. Henry dear, do\nnot deny my request before my patience are exhausted. Then I will tell you\nall. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache. today. and\nwrite BY RETURN to your longing",

        "P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to know.",
        "He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell\nand placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it\nbecause no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then\nwalking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there\na word. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you\ndon’t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we\nsoon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha’s perfume. Having\nread it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his\nsidepocket.",
        "Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder\ndid she wrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good\nfamily like me, respectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the\nrosary. Thank you: not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running\nround corners. Bad as a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect.\nNarcotic. Go further next time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of\ncourse. Brutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.",
        "Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.\nCommon pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere:\npinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses\nwithout thorns.",
        "Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in\nthe Coombe, linked together in the rain.",

        "It? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all day\ntyping. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your wife\nuse. Now could you make out a thing like that?",
        "    to Keep It Up.",
        "Martha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or\nfaked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious. Also\nthe two sluts in the Coombe would listen.",
        "    to Keep It Up.",
        "Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:\nquiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have been,\nstrange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper:\nfruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in\nthe wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the\ntrottingmatches. She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell her: more and\nmore: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.",
        "Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly\nin shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered away,\nsank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.",
        "Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in\nthe same way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure\ncheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be\nmade out of porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change\nhis shirt four times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A\nmillion pounds, wait a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,\neightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.\nOne and four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen millions of\nbarrels of porter.",

        "An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.\nBarrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The\nbungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together,\nwinding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of\nliquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.",
        "He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the\nporch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again\nbehind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work M’Coy\nfor a pass to Mullingar.",

They’re taught that. He’s not going\nout in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is\nhe? The glasses would take their fancy, flashing. Like to see them sitting\nround in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening. Still life. Lap it\nup like milk, I suppose.",
        "The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps,\npushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.",
        "Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place\nto be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow\nmusic. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the\nbenches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch knelt\nat the altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the\nthing in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a\ndrop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.\nHer hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her hat sank at once. Then the\nnext one: a small old woman. The priest bent down to put it into her\nmouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one. Shut your eyes and\nopen your mouth. What? CORPUS: body. Corpse. Good idea the Latin.\nStupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They don’t seem to chew it:\nonly swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse. Why the cannibals\ncotton to it.",
        "He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by\none, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in\nits corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear. We\nought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here and\nthere, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to\nmelt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it’s that sort of\nbread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes them feel\nhappy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it’s called. There’s a big\nidea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel. First\ncommunicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one family party,\nsame in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I’m sure of that. Not\nso lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit spreeish. Let off\nsteam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes cure, waters of\noblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. Old fellow asleep\nnear that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind faith. Safe in the arms\nof kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time next year.",
        "He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel\nan instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace\naffair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn’t know what to\ndo to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S.\nMolly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have suffered,\nit is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.",
        "Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up\nwith a veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be\nhere with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on\nthe sly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen’s evidence on the\ninvincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion\nevery morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I am\nthinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six children\nat home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those crawthumpers,\nnow that’s a good name for them, there’s always something shiftylooking\nabout them. They’re not straight men of business either. O, no, she’s\nnot here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up that envelope?\nYes: under the bridge.",
        "The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs\nsmartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank\nwhat they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage\nWheatley’s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale\n(aromatic). Doesn’t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other. Cold\ncomfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they’d have one old booser\nworse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.

Father Bernard Vaughan’s sermon first. Christ or Pilate? Christ,\nbut don’t keep us all night over it. Music they wanted. Footdrill stopped.\nCould hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.\nI could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up:",

Palestrina for\nexample too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too,\nchanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green\nChartreuse. Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit\nthick. What kind of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own\nstrong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn’t feel anything after.\nKind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don’t they? Gluttons, tall,\nlong legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.",
        "He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about\nand bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom\nglanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up\nat the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again and he\nsat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the altar,\nholding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other\nin Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:",

How I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be\nin Rome: they work the whole show. And don’t they rake in the money too?\nBequests also: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion.\nMasses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.\nMonasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in\nthe witnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything.\nLiberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of the\nchurch: they mapped out the whole theology of it.",
        "The priest prayed:",

        "The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The\nwomen remained behind: thanksgiving.",

        "Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping\nJupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she’s a dear girl. Soon\nbe a woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman\ntoo. Life, life.",
        "The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.",
        "–Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.",
        "–He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him. Do\nyou follow me?",
        "He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away\ncrustcrumbs from under his thighs.",
        "–What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?",
        "–Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power\nsaid.",
        "All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed\nbuttonless leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned\ndownward and said:",
        "–Unless I’m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?",
        "–It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.",
        "Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet\nquite clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.",
        "Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.",
        "–After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.",
        "–Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak\nof his beard gently.",
        "–Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.",
        "–And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.",
        "–At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.",
        "–I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he’d try to come.",
        "The carriage halted short.",
        "–What’s wrong?",
        "–We’re stopped.",
        "–Where are we?",
        "Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.",
        "–The grand canal, he said.",
        "Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never\ngot it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.\nShame really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles.\nFlaxseed tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don’t\nmiss this chance. Dogs’ home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,\nLeopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave. A\ndying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men’s dogs\nusually are.",
        "A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of\nshower spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a\ncolander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.",
        "–The weather is changing, he said quietly.",
        "–A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.",
        "–Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There’s the sun again coming out.",
        "Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun,\nhurled a mute curse at the sky.",
        "–It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.",
        "–We’re off again.",
        "The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed\ngently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.",
        "–Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking\nhim off to his face.",
        "–O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him,\nSimon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of THE CROPPY BOY.",
        "–Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. HIS SINGING OF THAT SIMPLE\nBALLAD, MARTIN, IS THE MOST TRENCHANT RENDERING I EVER HEARD IN THE WHOLE\nCOURSE OF MY EXPERIENCE.",
        "–Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He’s dead nuts on that. And the\nretrospective arrangement.",
        "–Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.",
        "–I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?",
        "–In the paper this morning.",
        "Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must\nchange for her.",
        "–No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.",
        "Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the\ndeaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what\nPeake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s? no, Sexton,\nUrbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.\nThanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of\nhis. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness.

        "I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it in\nthe bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled.\nBefore my patience are exhausted.",
        "National school. Meade’s yard. The hazard. Only two there now.\nNodding. Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting\nround with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised\ntheir hats.",
        "A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a\ntramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window. Couldn’t they invent something\nautomatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow\nwould lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job\nmaking the new invention?",
        "Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a\ncrape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law\nperhaps.",
        "They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway\nbridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene Stratton,\nMrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder. I said I.\nOr the LILY OF KILLARNEY? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big powerful\nchange. Wet bright bills for next week. FUN ON THE BRISTOL. Martin\nCunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or\ntwo. As broad as it’s long.",
        "He’s coming in the afternoon. Her songs.",
        "Plasto’s. Sir Philip Crampton’s memorial fountain bust. Who was he?",
        "–How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow\nin salute.",
        "–He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?",
        "–Who? Mr Dedalus asked.",
        "–Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.",
        "Just that moment I was thinking.",
        "Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the\nwhite disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.",
        "Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right\nhand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?\nFascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes\nfeel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just\nlooking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bit\nsofty. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes that? I suppose\nthe skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the\nshape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night of\nthe dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.",
        "He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant\nglance over their faces.",
        "Mr Power asked:",
        "–How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?",
        "–O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It’s a good\nidea, you see ...",
        "–Are you going yourself?",
        "–Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the\ncounty Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the\nchief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.",
        "–Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.",
        "Have you good artists?",
        "–Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we’ll have all\ntopnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in\nfact.",
        "–And MADAME, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.",
        "Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and\nclasped them. Smith O’Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.\nWoman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage\nwheeling by Farrell’s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.",
        "Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his\nmouth opening: oot.",
        "–Four bootlaces for a penny.",
        "Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume\nstreet. Same house as Molly’s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for\nWaterford. Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning\ntoo. Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.\nO’Callaghan on his last legs.",
        "And MADAME. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.\nDoing her hair, humming. VOGLIO E NON VORREI. No. VORREI E NON. Looking\nat the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. MI TREMA UN POCO IL.\nBeautiful on that TRE her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle.\nThere is a word throstle that expresses that.",
        "His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face. Greyish\nover the ears. MADAME: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way.\nOnly politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the\nwoman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told\nme, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty\nquick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of\nrumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury’s. Or the Moira, was it?",
        "They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator’s form.",
        "Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.",
        "–Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.",
        "A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner\nof Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.",
        "–In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.",
        "Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:",
        "–The devil break the hasp of your back!",
        "Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as\nthe carriage passed Gray’s statue.",
        "–We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.",
        "His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:",
        "–Well, nearly all of us.",
        "Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces.",
        "–That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and\nthe son.",
        "–About the boatman? Mr Power asked.",
        "–Yes. Isn’t it awfully good?",
        "–What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn’t hear it.",
        "–There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send\nhim to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were both ...",
        "–What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?",
        "–Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried\nto drown ...",
        "–Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!",
        "Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.",
        "–No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself ...",
        "Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:",
        "–Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their\nway to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and\nover the wall with him into the Liffey.",
        "–For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?",
        "–Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and\nfished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the\nfather on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.",
        "–Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is ...",
        "–And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for\nsaving his son’s life.",
        "A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.",
        "–O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.",
        "–Isn’t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.",
        "–One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.",
        "Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.",
        "Nelson’s pillar.",
        "–Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!",
        "–We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.",
        "Mr Dedalus sighed.",
        "–Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.\nMany a good one he told himself.",
        "–The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his\nfingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and\nhe was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this. He’s\ngone from us.",
        "–As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went\nvery suddenly.",
        "–Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.",
        "He tapped his chest sadly.",
        "Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red\nnose. Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent\ncolouring it.",
        "Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.",
        "–He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.",
        "–The best death, Mr Bloom said.",
        "Their wide open eyes looked at him.",
        "–No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.",
        "No-one spoke.",
        "Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,\ntemperance hotel, Falconer’s railway guide, civil service college, Gill’s,\ncatholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. At\nnight too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the late Father\nMathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.",
        "White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda\ncorner, galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A\nmourning coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors.\nDun for a nun.",
        "–Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.",
        "A dwarf’s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy’s was. Dwarf’s\nbody, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society\npays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby.\nMeant nothing. Mistake of nature. If it’s healthy it’s from the mother.\nIf not from the man. Better luck next time.",
        "–Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It’s well out of it.",
        "The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle\nhis bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.",
        "–In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.",
        "–But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.",
        "Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.",
        "–The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.",
        "–Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We\nmust take a charitable view of it.",
        "–They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.",
        "–It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.",
        "Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham’s\nlarge eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.\nLike Shakespeare’s face. Always a good word to say. They have no\nmercy on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They\nused to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it\nwasn’t broken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the\nriverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a\nwife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the\nfurniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the\ndamned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start afresh.\nShoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight that night\nDedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and capering with\nMartin’s umbrella.",

        "He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.",
        "That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The\nroom in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through\nthe slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner’s sunlit ears, big and hairy.\nBoots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow\nstreaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict:\noverdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.",
        "No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.",
        "The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.",
        "–We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.",
        "–God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.",
        "–I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow\nin Germany. The Gordon Bennett.",
        "–Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.",
        "As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent\nover and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody\nhere seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from SAUL. He’s as bad\nas old Antonio.  He left me on my ownio.  Pirouette!  The MATER\nMISERICORDIAE. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for\nincurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady’s Hospice for the dying.\nDeadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look\nterrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the\nspoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student\nthat was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He’s gone over to the lying-in\nhospital they told me. From one extreme to the other. The carriage\ngalloped round a corner: stopped.",
        "–What’s wrong now?",
        "A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing,\nslouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted\nbony croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating\ntheir fear.",

        "–Huuuh! the drover’s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.",
        "Huuuh! out of that!",
        "Thursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold\nthem about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for\nold England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter\nlost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a\nyear. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,\nsoap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the\ntrain at Clonsilla.",
        "The carriage moved on through the drove.",
        "–I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the\nparkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken in\ntrucks down to the boats.",
        "–Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite\nright. They ought to.",
        "–Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have\nmunicipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line\nout to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and\nall. Don’t you see what I mean?",
        "–O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon\ndiningroom.",
        "–A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.",
        "–Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn’t it be more\ndecent than galloping two abreast?",
        "–Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.",
        "–And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when\nthe hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road.",
        "–That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell\nabout the road. Terrible!",
        "–First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.",
        "–Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.",
        "Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy\nDignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too\nlarge for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what’s up\nnow. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides\ndecompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also.\nWith wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.",
        "–Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.",
        "Dunphy’s corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.\nA pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we’ll pull up\nhere on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.\nElixir of life.",
        "But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in\nthe knocking about? He would and he wouldn’t, I suppose. Depends on\nwhere. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It\nwould be better to bury them in red: a dark red.",
        "In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse\ntrotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.",
        "Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.",
        "Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his\ndropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a\nslacktethered horse. Aboard of the BUGABU.",
        "Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated\non his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of\nreeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,\nMoyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycle\ndown. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at the\nauction but a lady’s. Developing waterways. James M’Cann’s hobby to row\nme o’er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats. Camping\nout. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without writing.\nCome as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by lock to\nDublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his brown straw\nhat, saluting Paddy Dignam.",

        "–The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.",
        "–Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That’s the maxim of\nthe law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent\nperson to be wrongfully condemned.",
        "They looked. Murderer’s ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered,\ntenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully\ncondemned. Murder. The murderer’s image in the eye of the murdered.\nThey love reading about it. Man’s head found in a garden. Her clothing\nconsisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used.\nMurderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed.\nMurder will out.",
        "Cramped in this carriage. She mightn’t like me to come that way\nwithout letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once\nwith their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.",

        "He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed,\nHynes walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and\ntook out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.",
        "Where is that child’s funeral disappeared to?",
        "A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,\ndragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a\ngranite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.",
        "Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it\nwith his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on\na bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every\nday? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome for\nthe protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.\nShovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands every hour.\nToo many in the world.",
        "Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed\nharpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl’s face stained with\ndirt and tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to\ncry. Fish’s face, bloodless and livid.",
        "The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So\nmuch dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First the\nstiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy followed\nwith their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.",
        "All walked after.",
        "Martin Cunningham whispered:",
        "–I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.",
        "–What? Mr Power whispered. How so?",
        "–His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the\nQueen’s hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.\nAnniversary.",
        "–O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?",
        "He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes\nfollowed towards the cardinal’s mausoleum. Speaking.",
        "–Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.",
        "–I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily mortgaged.\nMartin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.",
        "–How many children did he leave?",
        "–Five. Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.",
        "–A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.",
        "–A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.",
        "–Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.",
        "Has the laugh at him now.",
        "He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had\noutlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must\noutlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the\nworld. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you’ll soon follow\nhim. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who\nknows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on\na guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in\nthe end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts.\nAll for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the substance.\nSomething new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. It\nnever comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more\nin her warm bed.",
        "–How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven’t\nseen you for a month of Sundays.",
        "–Never better. How are all in Cork’s own town?",
        "–I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned\nLambert said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.",
        "–And how is Dick, the solid man?",
        "–Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.",
        "–By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?",
        "–Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,\npointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the\ninsurance is cleared up.",
        "–Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?",
        "–Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother. John Henry Menton is\nbehind. He put down his name for a quid.",
        "–I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought\nto mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.",
        "–How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?",
        "–Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.",
        "They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood\nbehind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and\nat the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he\nthere when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment\nand recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three\nshillings to O’Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin into\nthe chapel. Which end is his head?",
        "After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened\nlight. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow\ncandles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a\nwreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners\nknelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font\nand, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his\npocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently on\nhis left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.",
        "A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through\na door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one\nhand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s belly.\nWho’ll read the book? I, said the rook.",
        "They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book\nwith a fluent croak.",
        "Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. DOMINE-NAMINE.\nBully about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe\nbetide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst\nsideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on him\nlike a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burst\nsideways.",

        "My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That’s better.",
        "The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s\nbucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and\nshook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you\nwere before you rested. It’s all written down: he has to do it.",
        "–Et Ne Nos Inducas in Tentationem.",
        "The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be\nbetter to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of\ncourse ...",
        "Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed\nup with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.\nWhat harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a\nfresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in\nchildbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls\nwith little sparrows’ breasts. All the year round he prayed the same thing\nover them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.",
        "–In Paradisum.",

Corny\nKelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All\nfollowed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came\nlast folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the\nground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.

        "–Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll soon be stretched\nbeside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.",
        "Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little\nin his walk. Mr Power took his arm.",
        "–She’s better where she is, he said kindly.",
        "–I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in\nheaven if there is a heaven.",

        "–Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.",
        "Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.",
        "–The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can\ndo so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.",
        "They covered their heads.",
        "–The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think?\nMr Kernan said with reproof.",
        "Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret\neyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We are\nthe last. In the same boat. Hope he’ll say something else.",
        "Mr Kernan added:",
        "–The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more\nimpressive I must say.",
        "Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.",
        "Mr Kernan said with solemnity:",

        "Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.",
        "–Everything went off A1, he said. What?",

        "–As it should be, Mr Kernan said.",
        "–What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.",
        "Mr Kernan assured him.",

        "Ned Lambert glanced back.",
        "–Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the\nsoprano. She’s his wife.",
        "–O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven’t seen her for some time.\nhe was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen\ngolden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown. And a good armful she\nwas.",
        "He looked behind through the others.",

        "–In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like\nthat for? She had plenty of game in her then.",
        "–Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.",
        "John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead.",
        "The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among\nthe grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their\ncaps.",
        "–John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.",
        "Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:",

        "–My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don’t want your\ncustom at all.",
        "Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin\nCunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back.",
        "–Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?",
        "–I did not, Martin Cunningham said.",
        "They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The\ncaretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in\na discreet tone to their vacant smiles.",
        "–They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy\nevening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for\nMulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing\nabout in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the drunks spelt\nout the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statue\nof Our Saviour the widow had got put up.",
        "The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He\nresumed:",
        "–And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, NOT A BLOODY BIT LIKE THE\nMAN, says he. THAT’S NOT MULCAHY, says he, WHOEVER DONE IT.",
        "Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting\nthe dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.",
        "–That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.",
        "–I know, Hynes said. I know that.",
        "–To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It’s pure goodheartedness:\ndamn the thing else.",
        "Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk. All want to be on\ngood terms with him. Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort.

No later undoing will undo the\nfirst undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies\nableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s\ninvisible weapon.

Twenty\nyears he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary\nequal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His\nart, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art\nof surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of\nroses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh,\nwhen they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a\npair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough\nto vie with her of Sheba.

It repeats\nitself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter\nSusan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it was\nthe original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his\nwill and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are\nthose of my lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original\nsin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between\nthe lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone\nunder which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it.\nBeauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety\neverywhere in the world he has created, in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, twice\nin AS YOU LIKE IT, in THE TEMPEST, in HAMLET, in MEASURE FOR MEASURE–and\nin all the other plays which I have not read.",

Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jose he kills the\nreal Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly\nwilling that the moor in him shall suffer.",

        "–Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after\na life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has\nalways been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life\nended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The motion is\nended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet PERE and Hamlet FILS. A king and a\nprince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what though murdered\nand betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner,\nsorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be\ndivorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero,\nthe good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of love, and nuncle Richie,\nthe bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers\ngo. Strong curtain. He found in the world without as actual what was in his\nworld within as possible. Maeterlinck says: IF SOCRATES LEAVE HIS HOUSE\nTODAY HE WILL FIND THE SAGE SEATED ON HIS DOORSTEP. IF JUDAS GO FORTH\nTONIGHT IT IS TO JUDAS HIS STEPS WILL TEND. Every life is many days,\nday after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants,\nold men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting\nourselves. The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it\nbadly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of\nthings as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call DIO BOIA,\nhangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher,\nand would be bawd and cuckold too but  that in the economy of heaven,\nforetold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an\nandrogynous angel, being a wife unto himself.",

Just keeping alive.\nLovely weather we’re having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those\nfarmers are always grumbling. I’ll just take a thimbleful of your best\ngin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that\nGeneral Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And\nheartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal\nthing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most\nscandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose\nall burst. What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a\nboat like that ... Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know\nwhy? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that.\nAnd America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.",

Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh,\nthat’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance,\nsoldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his\nleft turned as he turned. That’s me in mourning. When is it? May the\ntwentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the right\nand on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking\nup. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall,\ncharming soubrette, beside the two puckers.

        "The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted\nby obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the\nnorthern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through\nthe metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river\ngreeted him vainly from afar Between Queen’s and Whitworth bridges lord\nDudley’s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley\nWhite, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White’s,\nthe pawnbroker’s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose\nwith his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough\nmore quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot\nthrough Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the\nporch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,\nCollis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the\ndoorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the\nPatriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed\nher plan and retracing her steps by King’s windows smiled credulously\non the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay\nwall under Tom Devan’s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue\nof liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by\nbronze, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head watched and admired.\nOn Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse\nfor the subsheriff’s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his\nhat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus’ greeting. From\nCahill’s corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance\nunperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant\nhad held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M’Coy,\ntaking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger\nGreene’s office and Dollard’s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,\ncarrying the Catesby’s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up,\nknew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn’t see\nwhat Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring’s big yellow\nfurniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord\nlieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of Kavanagh’s\nwinerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord\nlieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable\nWilliam Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson’s\nall times ticking watches and Henry and James’s wax smartsuited\nfreshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, DERNIER CRI James. Over against\nDame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the\ncavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him,\ntook his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and\ndoffed his cap to her. A charming SOUBRETTE, great Marie Kendall, with\ndauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William\nHumble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and\nalso upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the\nD. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the\nviceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms\ndarkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In\nFownes’s street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from\nChardenal’s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes\nspinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of\nCommercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold\nhunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the\nforeleg of King Billy’s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her\nhastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted\nin his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left\nbreast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C.,\nagreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby’s corner a jaded\nwhite flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind\nhim, E.L.Y’S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite\nPigott’s music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c,\ngaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved.\nBy the provost’s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes\nand socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of MY GIRL’S A YORKSHIRE\nGIRL.",
        "Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders’ skyblue frontlets and high\naction a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit\nof indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he\noffered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red\nflower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency\ndrew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which\nwas being discoursed in College park.

Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn’s\nhotel Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a\nfierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in\nthe window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street\nby Trinity’s postern a loyal king’s man, Hornblower, touched his tallyho\ncap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick\nAloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the\ntopper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by\nporksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to\ninaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer’s hospital,\ndrove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind\nstripling opposite Broadbent’s. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a\nbrown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the\nviceroy’s path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene\nStratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke\ntownship. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves,\nan umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder\nthe lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. On\nNorthumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually\nsalutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the\ngarden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen when\nvisiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849\nand the salute of Almidano Artifoni’s sturdy trousers swallowed by a\nclosing door.",

Communication was effected\nthrough the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and\nscarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned\nby his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that\nhe was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to\ntrial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral\nlevels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great\ndivide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly\nbut that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic\ndevelopment opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there\nresembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from\nmore favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped\nwith every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda,\nwataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy\nof the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was\nbrought and evidently afforded relief.

It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher,\nmanager of Messrs H. J. O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a\npersonal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying\nout of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it\nshould be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been\nlooking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that\nthe pair should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were\nstill good.

And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and,\nby the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk\nas a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol\nand by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s a queer\nstory, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel.\nJesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.\nAnd Bloom with his BUT DON’T YOU SEE? and BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. And sure,\nmore be token, the lout I’m told was in Power’s after, the blender’s,\nround in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week\nafter drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody\nestablishment. Phenomenon!",
        "–The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and\nglaring at Bloom.",
        "–Ay, ay, says Joe.",
        "–You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is ...",
        "–SINN FEIN! says the citizen. SINN FEIN AMHAIN! The friends we love are\nby our side and the foes we hate before us.",
        "The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far\nand near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the\ngloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums\npunctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening\nclaps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the\nghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its\nsupernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain\npoured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads\nof the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five\nhundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police\nsuperintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in\nthe vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away\nthe intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped\ninstruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by\nSperanza’s plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered\ncharabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of\nwhom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused\nby the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang THE\nNIGHT BEFORE LARRY WAS STRETCHED in their usual mirth-provoking fashion.\nOur two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among\nlovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for\nreal Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned\npennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who\nthronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this\nunexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due\nto the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording\nthe poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.\nThe viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was\nchaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the\ngrandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends\nof the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.\nThe delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore\nBacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed DOYEN of the party who had\nto be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane),\nMonsieur Pierrepaul Petitepatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire\nPokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von\nSchwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Viraga Kisaszony Putrapesthi,\nHiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh\nRahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y\nPalabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri,\nHi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps,\nPan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch,\nBorus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli,\nNationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent-\ngeneralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.\nAll the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the\nstrongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless\nbarbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated\naltercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I.\nas to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct\ndate of the birth of Ireland’s patron saint. In the course of the\nargument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots,\nmeatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig\niron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby\npoliceman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from\nBooterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude\nproposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for\nboth contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once\nappealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was\nheartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were\nbleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated\nfrom underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal\nadviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his\nthirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the\npockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their\nsenses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and\ngentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their\nrightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.",
        "Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless\nmorning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the GLADIOLUS CRUENTUS.\nHe announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so\nmany have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate–short, painstaking yet withal\nso characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman\nwas greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the\nviceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the\neven more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of\ncries, HOCH, BANZAI, ELJEN, ZIVIO, CHINCHIN, POLLA KRONIA, HIPHIP, VIVE,\nALLAH, amid which the ringing EVVIVA of the delegate of the land of song\n(a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the\neunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily\ndistinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o’clock. The signal for prayer\nwas then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were\nbared, the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the\npossession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by\nhis medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who\nadministered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when\nabout to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool\nof rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the\nthrone of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood\nthe grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a\ntengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which\nhis eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he\ntested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his\nbrawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of\nsheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary\noffice. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the\nquartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances\n(specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round\nand Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the\nduodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully\nextracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most\nprecious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the\namalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these\nvessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an\nexcellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions,\ndone to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had\nbeen considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption\nof the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits\nwhen prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the\nproceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare\nin these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the\ndying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be\ndivided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent\nroomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem. The NEC and\nNON PLUS ULTRA of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst\nher way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon\nthe muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for\nher sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring\nfondly SHEILA, MY OWN. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she\nkissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the\ndecencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him\nas they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever\ncherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to\nhis death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling\nmatch in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy\ndays of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they\nhad indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the\ndreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators,\nincluding the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That\nmonster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome\nwith grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of\ntears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people,\ntouched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least\naffected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of\nthe peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary,\nwere making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say\nthat there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most\nromantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate,\nnoted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and,\npresenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree,\nsolicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to\nname the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the\naudience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion\nin the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous\nact which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant\nyoung Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured\nnames in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his blushing FIANCEE\nan expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a\nfourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster\n provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson,\nwho presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number\nof sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain\nhis natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive\ntear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be\nin his immediate ENTOURAGE, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:",
        "–God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it\nmakes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I\nthinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.",
        "So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the\ncorporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak\ntheir own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for\na quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that\nhe cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the\nantitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating\nis about the size of it. Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink\ndown his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever\nsee the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow\ninto one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could\nget up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow\nwith a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot\nof colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals\nand oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh\nentertainment, don’t be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then\nan old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers\nshuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky\npilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females,\nhitting below the belt.",
        "So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty\nstarts mousing around by Joe and me. I’d train him by kindness, so I\nwould, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where\nit wouldn’t blind him.",
        "–Afraid he’ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.",
        "–No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.",
        "So he calls the old dog over.",
        "–What’s on you, Garry? says he.",
        "Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and\nthe old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.\nSuch growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that\nhas nothing better to do ought to write a letter PRO BONO PUBLICO to the\npapers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and\ngrousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the\nhydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.",
        "All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among\nthe lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not\nmissing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the\nfamous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the SOBRIQUET of\nGarryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and\nacquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of\ntraining by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises,\namong other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living\nphonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone\nunturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has\nfound it bears a STRIKING resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns\nof ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful\nlovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the\ngraceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the\nbookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an\ninteresting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the\nharsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions\nof the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more\nmodern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a\nspecimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar\nwhose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though\nwe believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather\nmore than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original,\nwhich recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of\nthe Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our\nreaders will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps\nit should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s\nverse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive\nof suppressed rancour.",

        "So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could\nhear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have\nanother.",
        "–I will, says he, A CHARA, to show there’s no ill feeling.",
        "Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from\none pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog\nand getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for\nman and beast. And says Joe:",

        "–Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won’t have anything in the\nway of liquid refreshment? says he.",
        "–Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet\nMartin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s.\nMartin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn’t\nserve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and\nnominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy.",
        "–Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is\nlanded. So the wife comes out top dog, what?",
        "–Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.",
        "–Whose admirers? says Joe.",
        "–The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.",
        "Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act\nlike the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of\nthe wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam\nowed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the\nmortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his\nmortgagor under the act.

True as you’re there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and\nprivileged Hungarian robbery.",
        "So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs\nDignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the\nfuneral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that\nthere was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell\nher. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the\ntragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You’re a rogue and I’m\nanother.",
        "–Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however\nslight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded,\nas I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of\nyou this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve\nlet the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.",
        "–No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which\nactuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust\nto me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of\nsorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the\nbitterness of the cup.",
        "–Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I\nfeel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the\nexpressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose\npoignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of\nspeech.",
        "And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five\no’clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby,\n14A.

And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph\nManuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in\nAdam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new\ntestament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.

        "A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of BRIAN\nO’CIARNAIN’S in SRAID NA BRETAINE BHEAG, under the auspices of SLUAGH NA\nH-EIREANN, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of\nphysical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and\nancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president\nof the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large\ndimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent\noration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and\ninstructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence\nensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient\ngames and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The\nwellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old\ntongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for\nthe resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes,\npractised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the\nbest traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from\nancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and\nhisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the\ndiscussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty\nplaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy\nrendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses (happily\ntoo familiar to need recalling here) A NATION ONCE AGAIN in the execution\nof which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of\ncontradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi\nwas in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the\ngreatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen\ncan sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality\ngreatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously\napplauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many\nprominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press\nand the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then\nterminated.",

        "It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were\nscheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped\nas he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by\nsuperlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a\ngruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had\ntapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh\nhad been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman\nputting in some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on\nlooking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a\npowerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting\nout a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett’s jaw. The redcoat\nducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being\na fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got\nhis man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler\npunishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took\nhis corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell\nwent came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the\nfistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man\nfor it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The\nreferee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky\nand his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies\nduring which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely\nfrom his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and\nlanded a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat.\nIt was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello\nbruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein\nthrew in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied\ncheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him\nwith delight.",

        "–But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn’t\nit be the same here if you put force against force?",
        "Didn’t I tell you? As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his\nlast gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.",
        "–We’ll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater\nIreland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the\nblack 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid\nlow by the batteringram and the TIMES rubbed its hands and told the\nwhitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as\nredskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the\nSassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of\ncrops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they\ndrove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the\ncoffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the\nland of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no\ncravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.",
        "–Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was ...",
        "–We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the\npoor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at\nKillala.",
        "–Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us\nagainst the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the\nbroken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild\ngeese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan in\nSpain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.\nBut what did we ever get for it?",
        "–The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what\nit is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren’t they\ntrying to make an ENTENTE CORDIALE now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with\nperfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.",
        "–CONSPUEZ LES FRANCAIS, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.",

The\nscenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths\nand cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones,\nare as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the\nSligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago\nin the time of the Barmecides.

The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion\nof which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech,\nfreely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias\nPraisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and\nemphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the\nBritish empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest\npossessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God\nand the secret of England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by\nthe white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal\ndedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a\nlovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast BLACK AND WHITE from the\nskull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak,\nsurnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of\nCottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently\nexecuting a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he\nswallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl\nhands.",

        "–I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.",
        "–Who? says I.",

        "–Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse\nin anger in his life?",
        "–That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back\nthat horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.\nBet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He’s the only\nman in Dublin has it. A dark horse.",
        "–He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.",

Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts\nthe bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us\na bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody\nmouseabout.

        "–Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!",

Do you know what I’m telling\nyou? It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and\nthrow him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then\nsloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a\nman. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.",

        "A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from\nthe metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid\nfarewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander\nThom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the\ndistant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of\nMurmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great ECLAT was\ncharacterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of\nancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the\ndistinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the\ncommunity and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully\nexecuted in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects\nevery credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob AGUS Jacob. The departing guest\nwas the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present\nbeing visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the\nwellknown strains of COME BACK TO ERIN, followed immediately by RAKOCZSY’S\nMARCH. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four\nseas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf,\nBray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and\nSperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks\nof M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid\ncheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big\nmuster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the\nmastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral\ntribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large\nnumbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of\nbarges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in\nsalute as were also those of the electrical power station at the\nPigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.

        "The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The\nobservatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth\ngrade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar\nseismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the\nyear of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have\nbeen that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay\nward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,\ntwo roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in\nthe vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble\nedifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important\nlegal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath\nwhich it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.\nFrom the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves\nwere accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic\ncharacter. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much\nrespected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk\numbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms\nand house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter\nsessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered\nby search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former\non the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s causeway, the latter embedded\nto the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen\nbay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they\nobserved an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through\nthe atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed\nsouthwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being\nhourly received from all parts of the different continents and the\nsovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a\nspecial MISSA PRO DEFUNCTIS shall be celebrated simultaneously by\nthe ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal\ndioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of\nthe souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called\naway from our midst.

        "The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious\nembrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all\ntoo fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud\npromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on\nthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the\nquiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the\nvoice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the\nstormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.",
        "The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening\nscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and oft\nwere they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat\nbeside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and\nEdy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky\nCaffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to\nmatch and the name H.M.S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy and\nJacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled\ntwins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry\nfaces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in the sand with\ntheir spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with\ntheir big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And Edy Boardman was\nrocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young\ngentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven months and nine\ndays old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his\nfirst babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat\nlittle plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.",
        "–Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of\nwater.",
        "And baby prattled after her:",
        "–A jink a jink a jawbo.",
        "Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children,\nso patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to\ntake his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and\npromised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup\non. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman\nwas as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. None of\nyour spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.\nA truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in\nher gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a\ngirl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint\nlanguage of little brother.",
        "But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy\nand Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception\nto this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand\nwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong\nthat it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the\nMartello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was\nselfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house\nis his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the\nwouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle\ntoo. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the\nattention of the girl friends.",
        "–Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,\nJacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch\nyou for that.",
        "His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for\ntheir big sister’s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was\ntoo after his misadventure. His little man-o’-war top and unmentionables\nwere full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing\nover life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was\nto be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening\nwith hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and\nshook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near\nhim she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.",
        "–Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.",
        "She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:",
        "–What’s your name? Butter and cream?",
        "–Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your\nsweetheart?",
        "–Nao, tearful Tommy said.",
        "–Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.",
        "–Nao, Tommy said.",
        "–I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from\nher shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart. Gerty is\nTommy’s sweetheart.",
        "–Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.",
        "Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered\nto Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the\ngentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.",
        "But who was Gerty?",
        "Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in\nthought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a\nspecimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was\npronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she\nwas more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful,\ninclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of\nlate had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch’s\nfemale pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get\nand that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual\nin its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid’s\nbow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster\nwith tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments\ncould make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves\nin bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once\nto Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers\ndrawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs\nfrom time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to\nlet on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never\nspeak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an\ninnate refinement, a languid queenly HAUTEUR about Gerty which\nwas unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.\nHad kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in\nher own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education\nGerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the\nland and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and\npatrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs\nto her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to\nher softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,\nthat imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm\nfew could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty’s were of\nthe bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive\nbrows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was\nMadame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess\nNovelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that\nhaunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and\nshe had never regretted it. Then there was blushing scientifically cured\nand how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but\nyour nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But\nGerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown\nwith a natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account\nof the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of\nluxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just\nnow at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest\nrosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish\nshyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not hold\nher equal.",
        "For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was\nabout to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination\nprompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips\npouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little\nlaugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew\nright well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him\ncooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel. As per\nusual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle\noff the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her\nwindow. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying\nhard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was\ngoing to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left\nthe high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the\nbicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps\nfor what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes,\npiercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might\nlearn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family\nand of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed\nVirgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an\nexquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the\nshape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know\nanywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at\nthe lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those\ngood cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and\nthat was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because\nhe didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.",
        "Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of\nDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be\nout. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it\nwas expected in the LADY’S PICTORIAL that electric blue would be worn)\nwith a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket\n(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her\nfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a\nnavy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful\nfigure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of\nwideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue\nchenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday\nweek afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last\nshe found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly\nshopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She\ndid it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then,\nsmiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her!\nAnd when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that\nwould take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the\nnewest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very\nPETITE but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never\nwould ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over\nher higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect\nproportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of\nher shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide\ngarter tops. As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows\nthe fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would\nnever see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had\nfour dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and\nnighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons,\nrosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself\nand blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them\nand she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust\nthose washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things.\nShe was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own\ncolour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere\non her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because\nhis father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition\nand because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was\ndressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out\nand that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on\ninside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long\nas it wasn’t of a Friday.",
        "And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is\nthere all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds\nto be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to\ntears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough not\ntoo much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. You are\nlovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls upon a face\ninfinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes, she had\nknown from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been\narranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D.\n(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in\nthe fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous\nconfection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. He was\ntoo young to understand. He would not believe in love, a woman’s\nbirthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s (he was still in\nshort trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist\nshe went white to the very lips. He called her little one in a strangely\nhusky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end\nof her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about\nrefreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy\nWylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be\na man among men. But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap\nyear too and would soon be over. No prince charming is her beau ideal to\nlay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a\nstrong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly\nflecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering\narms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature\nand comfort her with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such\na one she yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she\nlongs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness\nin health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.",
        "And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was\njust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his\nlittle wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in\nthe face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would\nbe twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comforts\ntoo for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that\nfeeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and\nqueen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from\nall because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the\nfine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream\nthe milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like\nthe eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she\nwondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and\nthey would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and\nengravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog\nGarryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the\nchairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they\nhave in rich houses. He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always\nadmired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his\ncarefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent\nfor their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled\ndown in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they\nwould both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two\nselves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little\nwifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.",
        "Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so\nthen she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run\noff and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy\nsaid he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the\nball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was\nhis ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you\nplease. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy\nCaffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off now\nwith him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.",
        "–You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It’s my ball.",
        "But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her\nfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and\nTommy after it in full career, having won the day.",
        "–Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.",
        "And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s\nthe lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage\nand here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But Edy\ngot as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from\neveryone always petting him.",
        "–I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t say.",
        "–On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.",
        "Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy\nsaying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her\nlife to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure\nthe gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.",
        "–Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her\nnose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at him.",
        "Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her\nsometimes. For instance when she asked you would you have some more\nChinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s\nfaces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she\nwanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to\nthe Miss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget\nher the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned\ncork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.\nThere was none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself,\none of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your\ntwofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.",
        "And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the\npealing anthem of the organ. It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted\nby the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and\nbenediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered\ntogether without distinction of social class (and a most edifying\nspectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,\nafter the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of\nthe immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto,\nbeseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words,\nholy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty’s ears!\nHad her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by\ntaking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson’s\nWeekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. Over and\nover had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown\nstudy without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing\nout of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty\nbucket, thinking. But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths\nand homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even\nwitnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and\nhad seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget\nhimself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty\nknew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of\nkindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.",
        "And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,\nVirgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her\ncompanions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off\nSandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like\nhimself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him\nany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a\nfather because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it\nwas a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples\non it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor father!\nWith all his faults she loved him still when he sang TELL ME, MARY, HOW TO\nWOO THEE or MY LOVE AND COTTAGE NEAR ROCHELLE and they had stewed cockles\nand lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang THE\nMOON HATH RAISED with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God\nhave mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mother’s birthday that was and\nCharley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and\nPatsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.\nNo-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest.\nAnd her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of\nhis days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and\nshe had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his\noffice about Catesby’s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a\npalace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.",
        "A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house,\na ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.\nAnd when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it\nrubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like\nher mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing\nthey ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the world of her\nfor her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every\nnight and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she\nnever forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s\nchristmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in\nthe costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a\nbunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice\nwindow. You could see there was a story behind it. The colours were done\nsomething lovely. She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude\nand the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.\nShe often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain\npurpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with\nthe sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out\nin Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap\nabout the halcyon days what they meant.",
        "The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at\nlast Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting\nbehind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down\ntowards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to\nvoice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there\nby himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our two\nchampions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble\nCissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. The\ngentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand\ntowards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under\nGerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock. The twins clamoured again\nfor it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so\nGerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come\nrolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy\nlaughed.",
        "–If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.",
        "Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her\npretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her\nskirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly\ngood kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards\nthe shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention\non account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm flush, a\ndanger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her\ncheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but\nnow under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face\nthat met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed\nto her the saddest she had ever seen.",
        "Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and\nwith it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of\noriginal sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for\nus, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn\nhearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred\nand wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with\nhope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great\nsaint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin’s\nintercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who\nimplored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.",
        "The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of\nchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with\nbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep\nshe cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy\ngone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word,\ndidn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.",
        "–Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.",
        "And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for\neleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health,\na perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be\nsomething great, they said.",
        "–Haja ja ja haja.",
        "Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit\nup properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out,\nholy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket\nthe other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most\nobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:",
        "–Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.",
        "And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all no\nuse soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the\ngeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him\nin his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was\nquickly appeased.",
        "Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of\nthat and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats\nof twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the paintings\nthat man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such\na pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the\nclouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like\nthat and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a\nkind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went pitapat. Yes, it was her\nhe was looking at, and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into\nher as though they would search her through and through, read her very\nsoul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust\nthem? People were so queer. She could see at once by his dark eyes and his\npale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she\nhad of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she\npreferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that\nwanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she\ncould not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly RETROUSSE from\nwhere he was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the\nstory of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given\nworlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and\nhe saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles\nof her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.\nShe was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings\nthinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of\nwhich she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy\non her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he\nwas like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her\ndreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had\nsuffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been\nhimself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant\nor methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. There\nwere wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman\nnot like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists\nshowing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to\nforgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget\nthe memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a\nreal man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie,\nfor herself alone.",
        "Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. ORA PRO NOBIS. Well\nhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can\nnever be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the\nafflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.\nGerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass\nwindows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the\nblessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at\nthe altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down. He looked\nalmost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and\nhis hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun\nin their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena\nof Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she told him about that in\nconfession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see,\nnot to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were\nall subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no\nsin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said,\nand that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done\nunto me according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often\nshe thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered\nfloral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she\nnoticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out\nof a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the\nflowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what\nsort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of\nDublin or some place.",
        "The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky\nthrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little\nmonkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them\na good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of\nthem. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they\nwere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.",
        "–Jacky! Tommy!",
        "Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very\nlast time she’d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and she\nran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good\nenough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry\nshe was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it\nwasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran\nwith long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at\nthe side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy\nabout Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought\nshe had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runner\nshe ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat\nrunning and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would have\nserved her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally\non purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look\ntall and got a fine tumble. TABLEAU! That would have been a very charming\nexpose for a gentleman like that to witness.",
        "Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,\nthey prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed\nthe thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the\nBlessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was\nitching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because\nshe thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in\nall her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never\ntook his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible\nback to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament\nand the choir began to sing the TANTUM ERGO and she just swung her foot\nin and out in time as the music rose and fell to the TANTUMER GOSA\nCRAMEN TUM. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow’s\nof George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there\nwasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent,\nand not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form\n(the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference\nfor himself.",
        "Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with\nher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel\ntugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a\nfortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging\nlike a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her\nhair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on\na girl’s shoulders–a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in\nits sweetness. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found\na head of hair the like of that. She could almost see the swift answering\nflash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.\nShe put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and\nswung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the\nexpression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her\nwoman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the\nthought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour\nof her face became a glorious rose.",
        "Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,\nhalf smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the\nbaby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why\nno-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of\nhers. And she said to Gerty:",
        "–A penny for your thoughts.",
        "–What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.\nI was only wondering was it late.",
        "Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their\nbabby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a\ngentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the\ntime and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing\ntime, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to\nbe in early.",
        "–Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the time\nby his conundrum.",
        "So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his\nhand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his\nwatchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was\nGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he\nhad been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the\nnext moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed\nin every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.",
        "Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the\nright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it\nand looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his\nwatch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun\nwas set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in\nmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.\nCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said\nhis waterworks were out of order.",
        "Then they sang the second verse of the TANTUM ERGO and Canon\nO’Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and\nhe told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire\nto the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she\ncould see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and\nshe swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he\ncould see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or\nwhatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back\ninto his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and\nshe knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays\nthat that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she\nclipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves\non her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her\nshrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate\ngaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face. It is for you,\nGertrude MacDowell, and you know it.",
        "Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty\nnoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because\nit was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up\nthe pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to\nmake herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his\ncope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read\noff and he read out PANEM DE COELO PRAESTITISTI EIS and Edy and Cissy were\ntalking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay\nthem back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness\nwhen Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her\nover. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that\nspoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt–O yes, it cut deep because\nEdy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound\nlike the confounded little cat she was. Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to\nframe the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat,\nso slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist\nmight have dreamed of. She had loved him better than he knew.\nLighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never\nunderstand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was\nin the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were\nprobing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in\nsympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.",
        "–O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head\nflashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.",
        "Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the\nringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young\nvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.\nAs for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just\nchuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she\ncast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard\ninto a dozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she\ncould give him one look of measured scorn that would make him\nshrivel up on the spot. Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to\nno slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as\nthunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the\nlittle kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy\nand they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere,\nthat she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else\ntoo that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe\nand smoke it.",
        "Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy\ntucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too\nbecause the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And\nCissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go\ndeedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful\neyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and\nbaby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all\nand sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.",
        "–O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.",
        "The slight CONTRETEMPS claimed her attention but in two twos she set\nthat little matter to rights.",
        "Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and\nEdy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was\nflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it\noff with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because\njust then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore\nbecause Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father\nConroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed\nSacrament in his hands.",
        "How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of\nErin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat\nflew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a\ntiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so\npicturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was\neasier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his\nrounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady\nTritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her\nwindow where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that\nbook THE LAMPLIGHTER by Miss Cummins, author of MABEL VAUGHAN and\nother tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. She loved to\nread poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely\nconfession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she\nlaid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err\non the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. It was there\nshe kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her\nchild of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her\nalabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came\nhome from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written\nin it in violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for\nshe felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express\nherself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had\ncopied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. ART\nTHOU REAL, MY IDEAL? it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and\nafter there was something about TWILIGHT, WILT THOU EVER? and ofttimes\nthe beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted\nher eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping\nby for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she\nneed fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey\nhill and she always tried to conceal it. But it must end, she felt.\nIf she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding\nback for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the great\nsacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer than\nthe whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.\nThere was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a\nmarried man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the\nnobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put\ninto a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if–what then? Would it\nmake a very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate her\nfinebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person,\nthe fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went\nwith the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour,\ndegrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no: not\nthat. They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister\nwithout all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big\ness. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days\nbeyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understand\nhim because men were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting\nwith little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart\nof mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart\nthat told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world\nfor her for love was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what\nmight she would be wild, untrammelled, free.",
        "Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle\nand genuflected and the choir sang LAUDATE DOMINUM OMNES GENTES and\nthen he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and\nFather Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t\nshe coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:",
        "–O, look, Cissy!",
        "And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over\nthe trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.",
        "–It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.",
        "And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the\nchurch, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and\nCissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.",
        "–Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It’s the bazaar fireworks.",
        "But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and\ncall. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could\nsee from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set\nher pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,\nand a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, passion\nsilent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were left\nalone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he\ncould be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of\ninflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working\nand a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where\nthe fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not\nto fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and\nher when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that,\nsupply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting\nof his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion\nof men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead\nsecret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was\nstaying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures\ncut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he\nused to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in\nthe bed. But this was altogether different from a thing like that\nbecause there was all the difference because she could almost feel\nhim draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his\nhandsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t\ndo the other thing before being married and there ought to be\nwomen priests that would understand without your telling out and\nCissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look\nin her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad\nabout actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other\nthing coming on the way it did.",
        "And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back\nand the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they\nall saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned\nback ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying\nthrough the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman\ncandle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush,\nthey were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher\nand she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high,\nhigh, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine,\nan entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other\nthings too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin,\nbetter than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,\non account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then\nit went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in\nevery limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view\nhigh up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading\nand she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way\nlike that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment\nhalf offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen\nlooking and he kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him\nchokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his\nlips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little\nstrangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.\nAnd then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman\ncandle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in\nraptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and\nthey shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden,\nO so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!",
        "Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She\nglanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of\npiteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl\nHe was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he)\nstands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a\nbrute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him\nand, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been!\nHe of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes,\nfor him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and\nwandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their\nsecret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to\nknow or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening\nto and fro and little bats don’t tell.",
        "Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show\nwhat a great person she was: and then she cried:",
        "–Gerty! Gerty! We’re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.",
        "Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses. She slipped a hand into\nher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course\nwithout letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he’s too far to.\nShe rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again,\nthere, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of\nyester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls met in a\nlast lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a\nstrange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She half\nsmiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on\ntears, and then they parted.",
        "Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to\nCissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was\ndarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy\nseaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but\nwith care and very slowly because–because Gerty MacDowell was ...",
        "Tight boots? No. She’s lame! O!",
        "Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That’s why she’s left\non the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was wrong by\nthe cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a woman.\nBut makes them polite. Glad I didn’t know it when she was on show. Hot\nlittle devil all the same. I wouldn’t mind. Curiosity like a nun or a\nnegress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate. Near her\nmonthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such a bad headache\ntoday. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All kinds of crazy\nlongings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told\nme liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.\nSister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she. Something\nin the air. That’s the moon. But then why don’t all women menstruate\nat the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends on the time\nthey were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of step.\nSometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of that.\nDamned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her silly\nI will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this morning.\nThat gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife\nengagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for small\nmercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves.\nTheir natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.\nReserve better. Don’t want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O.\nPity they can’t see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was\nthat? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping\nTom. Willy’s hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot\nthose girls or is it all a fake? LINGERIE does it. Felt for the\ncurves inside her DESHABILLE. Excites them also when they’re. I’m all\nclean come and dirty me. And they like dressing one another for the\nsacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly’s new blouse. At first.\nPut them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet\ngarters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.\nHe wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met. His lovely\nshirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm with\nevery pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the pin of her.\nDressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just\nchanges when you’re on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary,\nMartha: now as then. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn’t in a hurry\neither. Always off to a fellow when they are. They never forget an\nappointment. Out on spec probably. They believe in chance because like\nthemselves. And the others inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends\nat school, arms round each other’s necks or with ten fingers locked,\nkissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns\nwith whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down,\nvindictive too for what they can’t get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write\nto me. And I’ll write to you. Now won’t you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till\nMr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon. TABLEAU! O, look\nwho it is for the love of God! How are you at all? What have you been\ndoing with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking\nholes in each other’s appearance. You’re looking splendid. Sister souls.\nShowing their teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn’t lend\neach other a pinch of salt.",
        "Ah!",
        "Devils they are when that’s coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.\nMolly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of\nmy foot. O that way! O, that’s exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest\nonce in a way. Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then. Safe in one way.\nTurns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I\nread in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she’s a\nflirt. All are. Daresay she felt 1. When you feel like that you often meet\nwhat you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a fellow\ncourting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.\nSame time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers? Suppose I\nwhen I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark\nand never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner have me as I am\nthan some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his\ndexter optic. To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my\nappearance my age. Didn’t let her see me in profile. Still, you\nnever know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and the\nbeast. Besides I can’t be so if Molly. Took off her hat to show\nher hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might\nknow her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair\nstrong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly’s combings when we were on\nthe rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money.\nWhy not? All a prejudice. She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. What? I\nthink so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did I forget to\nwrite address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? And the\nday I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put\nme off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he’s another. Weighs on his mind.\nFunny my watch stopped at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use\nto clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?",
        "O, he did. Into her. She did. Done.",
        "Ah!",
        "Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little\nlimping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant.\nStill you have to get rid of it someway. They don’t care. Complimented\nperhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the\nkiddies. Well, aren’t they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the\nstage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. AMOURS\nof actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up.\nMoonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Little\nsweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives a man.\nThat’s the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind the wall coming\nout of Dignam’s. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn’t have. Makes you want\nto sing after. LACAUS ESANT TARATARA. Suppose I spoke to her. What about?\nBad plan however if you don’t know how to end the conversation. Ask them a\nquestion they ask you another. Good idea if you’re stuck. Gain time. But\nthen you’re in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and\nyou see she’s on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the\nAppian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in\nMeath street that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of\ncourse. My arks she called it. It’s so hard to find one who. Aho! If you\ndon’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.\nAnd kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press\nthe button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn’t called me sir. O, her\nmouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That’s what\nthey enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of it.\nDifferent with me. Glad to get away from other chap’s wife. Eating off his\ncold plate. Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.\nFrench letter still in my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might\nhappen sometime, I don’t think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What?\nWorst is beginning. How they change the venue when it’s not what they\nlike. Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman\nwho. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his\nmind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something\nlike that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to\nwant something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must\nhave been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she\ncame to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The\npropitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by\ntheir eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till their\ndying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall\nbeside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed.\nFell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.\nFeatherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eye\non her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.",
        "There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks.\nUp like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be,\nwaiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in\nmother’s clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And\nthe dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could\nwhistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore in\nJammet’s wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling\nme the right time? I’ll tell you the right time up a dark lane. Say prunes\nand prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips. Caressing the\nlittle boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course they understand\nbirds, animals, babies. In their line.",
        "Didn’t look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn’t give that\nsatisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine\neyes she had, clear. It’s the white of the eye brings that out not so much\nthe pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog’s\njump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a\npicture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that innocence?\nPoor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see them sit\non a bench marked WET PAINT. Eyes all over them. Look under the bed\nfor what’s not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives.\nSharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner\nof Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at\nonce he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Typist\ngoing up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.\nHanded down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the\nbone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to\nsave the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye on a\nmirror. And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to Prescott’s\nby the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking!\nClever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries parcels\ntoo. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand, shaking it,\nto let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you learn that from?\nNobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don’t they know! Three years\nold she was in front of Molly’s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard\nstreet west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the\nworld. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.\nStill she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf.\nTransparent stockings, stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump\ntoday. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow!\nBeef to the heel.",

Sad however because\nit lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa’s\npants will soon fit Willy and fuller’s earth for the baby when they hold\nhim out to do ah ah.

Then they trot you out\nsome kind of a nondescript, wouldn’t know what to call her. Always see a\nfellow’s weak point in his wife. Still there’s destiny in it, falling in\nlove. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs\nif some woman didn’t take them in hand. Then little chits of girls,\nheight of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them he\nmatched them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes\none. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and\nrepent in December.

In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what\nwith argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was\nprompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might\nnot lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that\nshe was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and\nbedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her\ngoodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous\ngrieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs,\nis eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker,\nthe one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. But, gramercy, what of\nthose Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin\nagainst the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he\nsaid, our lust is brief. We are means to those small creatures within us\nand nature has other ends than we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch\nCostello wist he what ends. But he had overmuch drunken and the best word\nhe could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she\nwere or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of\nhis spleen of lustihead. Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young\nMalachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he\ncometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their\njibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint\nFoutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay\nin man to do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen\nand sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange\nhumour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that\nbare whoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous\nof mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,\nof Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of\nbrightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius\nsaith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or\nan she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, EFFECTU SECUTO,\nor peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and\nMoses Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human\nsoul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for\nGod’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to\nbear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the\nfisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church\nfor all ages founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would\nhe in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A\nwariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw,\nhe said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who\nhad ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also\nwith his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that\nmother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such\nsort deliverly he scaped their questions. That is truth, pardy, said\nDixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen was a\nmarvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor\nlendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and\nthat he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.",
        "But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had\npity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and\nas he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only\nmanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art\ncould save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart for\nthat evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s\nwool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie\nakeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now Sir\nLeopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his\nfriend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and\nas sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all\naccounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for\nyoung Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and\nmurdered his goods with whores.",
        "About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so\nas there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their\napproach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the\nintentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar\nof Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.

And he showed them\nglistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two\npound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.\nThey all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as\nwas herebefore. His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he\nsaid, time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions. What means this?

        "To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in\nEccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he\nhad not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the\nwomb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master\nLenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds\nand how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of\na confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all\nintershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he\nsaid very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the\neternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they\nrehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and\ndeflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to\nbe in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with\nburning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and\nthe anthem UT NOVETUR SEXUS OMNIS CORPORIS MYSTERIUM till she was there\nunmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those\ndelicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is\nin their MAID’S TRAGEDY that was writ for a like twining of lovers: TO\nBED, TO BED was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent\nupon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative\nsuadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the\nparanymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial\ncommunion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee,\nyoung sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth,\nof such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen said indeed to his best\nremembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews\nto make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those\ndays and the custom of the country approved with it. Greater love than\nthis, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.\nGo thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect, saith\nZarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the\nuniversity of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was\nmore beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou\nwilt have the secondbest bed. ORATE, FRATRES, PRO MEMETIPSO. And all the\npeople shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of\nold, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a\nstranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and\nkick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast\nmade me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants. Return, return, Clan\nMilly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why hast thou done this abomination\nbefore me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst\ndeny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy\ndaughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth now, my people, upon the land\nof behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the\nHorns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money. But thou hast\nsuckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for\never. And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my\nbitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth. This\ntenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined\nby the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from\non high Which brake hell’s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.\nAssuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully saith of his darling Stoics)\nand Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion.

        "A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on\nleft Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm\nthat hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and\nwitwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And\nhe that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all\nmark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift\nwas now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the\ncage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some\nmock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which\nMaster Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a\nblow on any the least colour.

        "But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? No, for he\nhad in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be\ndone away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the\nother? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But\ncould he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the\nbottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not\nthere to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the\ngod Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why,\nhe could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding\n(which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that he was in the\nland of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like\nthe rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to die like the rest\nand pass away? By no means would he though he must nor would he make more\nshows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them\nto do by the book Law. Then wotted he nought of that other land which is\ncalled Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the\nking Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no\nbirth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as\nbelieve on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had\npointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with\na certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-\nin-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her\nflatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither\nand I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly\nthat she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some\nlearned, Carnal Concupiscence.",

        "So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and\nafter hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a\nfifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields\nathirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.\nHard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle\nthis long while back as no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds\nall gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag\nand faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world saying, for\naught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the\nland so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But by and by, as\nsaid, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish\nswollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise\nporing up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten\nof the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of\nshakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men\nmaking shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk\nskipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came. In Ely place,\nBaggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles\nstreet a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair\nor coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first. Over\nagainst the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon’s door (that is to sit with Mr\nHealy the lawyer upon the college lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman’s\ngentleman that had but come from Mr Moore’s the writer’s (that was a\npapish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec.\nBannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green)\nthat was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and\nMal M’s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in\nthe earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being\nstayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a\nskittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while\npoured with rain and so both together on to Horne’s. There Leop. Bloom of\nCrawford’s journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling\nfellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy’s, Vin. Lynch, a Scots\nfellow, Will. Madden, T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and\nStephen D. Leop. Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, be\nhaving dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red\nslippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken\nto be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through\npleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her\nterm, the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a\nbowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath\nvery heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they\nsay, but God give her soon issue. ’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear,\nand Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth\nand with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand\nin the king’s bible.

        "With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter\nwas in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for\nhe swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on\nStephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near\nby which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that went\nfor a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh\nor hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes\nand for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns\nwith crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men, runners, flatcaps,\nwaistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with\na chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of\nwhom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip. He took his\nordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of\nbroken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he\ncould always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had\nfrom a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their\nsides. The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry\nor a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about\nKerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. But they can go\nhang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.\nThere’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly\nhe offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed\nwishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief\ndesign of his embassy as he was sharpset. MORT AUX VACHES, says Frank\nthen in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper\nthat has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman\ntoo. From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a\nheadborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and\nthe use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the\nmechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was\nmore familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his\nvolumes. One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher,\nthen nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he\nwas for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk,\nkidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen\nor choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times as a cat\nhas lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father\nthe headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. What,\nsays Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift\nof it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morning\ngoing to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce believe ’tis so bad,\nsays he. And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers,\ngreasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for\nMr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock\nand meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street. I\nquestion with you there, says he. More like ’tis the hoose or the timber\ntongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such\nmatter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler\nthanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor\nRinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two\nof physic to take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent,\nplain dealing. He’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles\nwith a bull that’s Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature,\nsays Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an\nEnglish chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull\nthat was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder\nof them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr\nVincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a\nplumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had\nhorns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out\nof his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and\nrollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.\nWhat for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas\nthat was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who\nwere no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my\ncousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and\nwith that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the\nblessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him\na trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to\nthis day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in\nhis ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long\nholy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four\nfields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they dressed\nhim, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and\nruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over\nwith spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road\nwith a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he\ncould doss and dung to his heart’s content. By this time the father of\nthe faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could\nscarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels\nbrought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was\nfull he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a\nmystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all\nafter him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer\nnought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was\nthe only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in\nthe middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord\nHarry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon,\nif ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of\nConnemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful\nof mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the\ncountryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by\nlord Harry’s orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr\nVincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in\nthe world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and\nI’ll meddle in his matters, says he. I’ll make that animal smell hell,\nsays he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But one\nevening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt\nto go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself\nbut the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with\npitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and\non picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found\nsure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion\nbull of the Romans, BOS BOVUM, which is good bog Latin for boss of the\nshow. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a\ncow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it\nout again told them all his new name. Then, with the water running off\nhim, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his\ngrandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he\ncould never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he\ncopied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he\nfilled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the\nside of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In\nshort, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse\nand a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of\nthe island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of\none mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of\nchattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang\ntheir luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head\nbetween wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly\nRoger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their\nbumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America. Which was the\noccasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that\nrollicking chanty:",
        "  –POPE PETER’S BUT A PISSABED.\n    A MAN’S A MAN FOR A’ THAT.",
        "Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway\nas the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend\nwhom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,\nwho had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a\ncornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil\nenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a\nproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched\non. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards\nwhich he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend\nprinted in fair italics: MR MALACHI MULLIGAN. FERTILISER AND INCUBATOR.\nLAMBAY ISLAND. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw\nfrom the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir\nFopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself\nto the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well,\nlet us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it\nsmacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. ’Tis as cheap sitting as\nstanding. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon\nhis design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a\nconsideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the\nprohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal\nvexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the\nprohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities\nacquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch\ndefrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable\nfemales with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their\nflambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly\nbloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might\nmultiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of\ntheir sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he\nassured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which he\nconcluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with\ncertain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had\nresolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island\nfrom its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much\nin favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a\nnational fertilising farm to be named OMPHALOS with an obelisk hewn and\nerected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman\nservices for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever\nwho should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the\nfunctions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take\na penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent\nlady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm\npersuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his\nnutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of\nsavoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter\nprolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled\nand stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.\nAfter this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr\nMulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had\nshielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for\nall their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr\nMulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.\nHis project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and\nwon hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it,\nasking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to\nNewcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt\nquotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to\nhim a sound and tasteful support of his contention: TALIS AC TANTA\nDEPRAVATIO HUJUS SECULI, O QUIRITES, UT MATRESFAMILIARUM NOSTRAE LASCIVAS\nCUJUSLIBET SEMIVIRI LIBICI TITILLATIONES TESTIBUS PONDEROSIS ATQUE\nEXCELSIS ERECTIONIBUS CENTURIONUM ROMANORUM MAGNOPERE ANTEPONUNT, while\nfor those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal\nkingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest\nglade, the farmyard drake and duck.",
        "Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man\nof person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with\nanimadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics\nwhile the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had\nadvanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a\npassage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his\nnearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom\nwere those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a\ncivil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional\nassistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily,\nthough preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there\nabout a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was in an interesting\ncondition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh)\nto know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon, to turn the\ntable, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient\nventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic\ngestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the\nnoted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach. For answer\nMr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely\nbelow the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother\nGrogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a\ntrollop): There’s a belly that never bore a bastard. This was so happy a\nconceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into\nthe most violent agitations of delight. The spry rattle had run on in the\nsame vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.",
        "Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little\nfume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion\nwith the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient\npoint, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the\nobligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a\nquestioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not\nachieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but\ncontrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever\ndone in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. MAIS BIEN SUR,\nnoble stranger, said he cheerily, ET MILLE COMPLIMENTS. That you may and\nvery opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.\nBut, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a\ncupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it\nin my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers\nabove for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things. With\nthese words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent\ndraught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out\npopped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he\nhad cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those\nfeatures with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but\nbeheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her\ndainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she\ntold me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a\ntenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by\ngenerous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an\nenemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so touched in\nall my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy\nwill he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours. A sigh\nof affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the\nlocket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. Beneficent\nDisseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal\nmust be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free\nand the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the\nheyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. But indeed,\nsir, I wander from the point. How mingled and imperfect are all our\nsublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish. Would to God that\nforesight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to\nthink of it. Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of\nus a penny the worse. But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his\nforehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a\nMARCHAND DE CAPOTES, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a livre as\nsnug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut,\ntut! cries Le Fecondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that\nmost accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle AVEC LUI\nin a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape\nHorn, VENTRE BICHE, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the\nstoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, SANS BLAGUE,\nhas sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to\nanother world. Pooh! A LIVRE! cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are\ndear at a sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is\nworth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear\nKitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she\nwould starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me\n(blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to\nsnap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine\nblessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household\nword that IL Y A DEUX CHOSES for which the innocence of our original\ngarb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest,\nnay, the only garment. The first, said she (and here my pretty\nphilosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently\ntipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath\n... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse\nwhich promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.",
        "Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while\nall were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,\nhaving spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a\nprofound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a party\nof debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not\nless severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the\nmost licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of\nribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. A\nmonstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.\nWhat, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad’s bud, immensely so, said Mr\nLynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice.\nDemme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. As I\nlook to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any\ntime these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in\nthe primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest\nsquirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me,\nI’m all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you’re as bad as dear little Father\nCantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried\nCostello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady what’s got a\nwhite swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however,\nrose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just\nthen informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence had\nbeen pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was\nENCEINTE which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given\nbirth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those who,\nwithout wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling\nprofession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest\npower for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if need\nwere I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble\nexercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious\nincentive in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such\nan one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the\nastonishment of ours? And at an instant the most momentous that can\nbefall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of\nthe future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and\nwhere no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of\nHorne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present\non the by and repaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all\nand some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design\nwhich would have been effected nor would he have received more than his\nbare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a\nhorrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son\nof the true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was\nalways the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most\nparticular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to\na rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on\nwith a loving heart.",
        "To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of\nsome impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits\nof that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The\nyoung sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown\nchildren: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly\nunderstood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous MOTS were\nsuch that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously\nsensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits\nspoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome\nlanguage for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a\ncropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and\nthrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the\ndint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as\nto put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain\ndesiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now for more than the\nmiddle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand\nvicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man\nof rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a\nrising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution,\nfoster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds\njeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable. To\nthose who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a\nhabit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede\nneither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding:\nwhile for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there\nremained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to\nbeat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel\nwith mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the\ngruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer\nexpresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to\npretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when\nshe was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while from the sister’s\nwords he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be\nowned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so\nauspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the\nmercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.",
        "Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express\nhis notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express\none) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not\nto be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement\nsince she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy\nyoung blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or\nat least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I must\nacquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a\nresonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again\ntoday, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a\nrequest to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I bade him\nhold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. ’Slife,\nI’ll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old\nbucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell to\npraising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade\nheld with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the\nman in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant\nvendor of articles needed in every household. Singular, communed the\nguest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis\npossessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting\ntheatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere\nacquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of\ntime these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art\nwhich most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further\nadded, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress\nthem for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh\ntogether.",
        "But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has\nthis alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to\ncivic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal\npolity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?\nDuring the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with\nhis granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to\ndischarge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will\nwhile he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he\nforgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from\nbeing a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if\nreport belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from\ncandour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of\na gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue\nbut if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his\ninterest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been too\nlong and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to\nhis objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the\ndesperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety,\nwho did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit\nintercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of\nsociety! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel,\nit had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question\nof the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s\nhearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort\ncouched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes\nhim to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies\nfallow for the want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty\nis second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense\nhis balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore\nto health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist\nbetter with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is the\nrepository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The lewd\nsuggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected\nand debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at\nhis best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve\nand flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more\ntemperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that\ncomes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.",
        "The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial\nusage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior\nmedical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation\nthat an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to the women’s\napartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the\npresence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members\nof the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the\ndelegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and\nhoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the\nsimultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier,\nbroke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr\nCanvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.\nThe moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness\nwhich seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every\nphase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal\nrepugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with\nrespect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother,\nthe fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by\nthe impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of\nthe wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty\ntouching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or\ndissimulated, the acardiac FOETUS IN FOETU and aprosopia due to a\ncongestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr\nCandidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary\nknobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what\nthe other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the\nprolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure\non the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as\nexemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the\nmatrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the\nwomb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of\nthe species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that\ndistressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers STURZGEBURT,\nthe recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births\nconceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents–in a\nword all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in\nhis masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest\nproblems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much\nanimation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as\nthe forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her\nmovement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction\nupon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually\nentertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long\nusage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities of\nharelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark\nand portwine stain were alleged by one as a PRIMA FACIE and natural\nhypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel\nSteevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The\nhypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and\nworthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged\nin such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent\nto the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views,\nwith such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation\nbetween women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own\navouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the\ngenius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of\nhis Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but\nshortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an\nallocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which\nnone better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest\nobject of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated\nargument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch\nregarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of\none Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent\nwas referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor\nDeacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by\npreternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was\ninvested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as\nsome thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man\nto put asunder what God has joined.",
        "But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up the\nscene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in\nthe recess appeared ... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep!\nHe had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a\nphial marked POISON. Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all\nfaces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipated some such\nreception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history\nis to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer of Samuel Childs. And how\nI am punished!

An instant later\nhis head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row\nstation at ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of\nthe dissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The\nvendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: LEX TALIONIS. The sentimentalist\nis he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a\nthing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was\nunveiled. Haines was the third brother. His real name was Childs. The\nblack panther was himself the ghost of his own father. He drank drugs to\nobliterate. For this relief much thanks. The lonely house by the\ngraveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. The spider pitches her\nweb in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from his hole. A curse is on\nit. It is haunted. Murderer’s ground.",
        "What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the\nchameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the\nmerry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her\nmood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud\nof reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest\nsubstance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is young\nLeopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a\nmirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then is\nseen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house\nin Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him\nbandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother’s\nthought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first\nhard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged\ntraveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented\nhandkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a\nthing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or\nthat halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a\nbudding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his studied\nbaisemoins. The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and\noleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the\nhead of the firm, seated with Jacob’s pipe after like labours in the\npaternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading\nthrough round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month\nbefore. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young\nknighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.\nNow he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons. Who can\nsay? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of a drizzling night\nin Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first. Together\n(she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a\nbare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of\nthe watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie!\nBridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night:\nfirst night, the bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness,\nthe willer with the willed, and in an instant (FIAT!) light shall flood\nthe world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath ’twas\ndone but–hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away\nthrough the murk. She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. She\ndare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No, Leopold. Name and memory\nsolace thee not. That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from\nthee–and in vain. No son of thy loins is by thee. There is none now to\nbe for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.",
        "The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the\ninfinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions\nof cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight\never descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her\ndusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her mother with\nungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms are they,\nyet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a\nsupple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. They fade, sad\nphantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls\nand the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more. And on the\nhighway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the\nghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads\nthem, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and\nyak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come\ntrooping to the sunken sea, LACUS MORTIS. Ominous revengeful zodiacal\nhost! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the\ntrumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and\ncrawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning\nmultitude, murderers of the sun.",
        "Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible\ngulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent\ngrows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s own\nmagnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo, wonder\nof metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the\ndaystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one,\nMillicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she now\narise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour,\nshod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it\ngossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it\nstreams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents\nof the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling,\nwrithing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad\nmetamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon\nthe forehead of Taurus.",
        "Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at\nschool together in Conmee’s time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,\nPisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the\npast and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them\ninto life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my\ncall? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard,\nam lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair with a\ncoronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those leaves,\nVincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and\ngreatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.\nAll who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to see you bring\nforth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. I heartily\nwish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on\nthe shoulder near him. Have no fear. He could not leave his mother an\norphan. The young man’s face grew dark. All could see how hard it was for\nhim to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He would have\nwithdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.\nMadden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name:\nLenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh!\noff, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with O. Madden up. She was leading\nthe field. All hearts were beating. Even Phyllis could not contain\nherself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the\nstraight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse\nThrowaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis\nwas silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But\nher lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which\nlay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A\nwhacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and\nthree today. What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the\nboisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us\nbear it as was the ancient wont. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he\nsaid with a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this\nhand, shall we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do you\nremember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent\nsaid. How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her)\nin her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of\nit. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with\ntheir persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In the sunny\npatches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns\nwith Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near\nthe bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I\nheld her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close.\nA week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free,\nblithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then. Her posies tool Mad\nromp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together. And in\nyour ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.\nConmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier\nbook with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to\nkeep the page. The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion,\nfeigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood\nclung there for the very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she\nglanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. But he had\nbeen kind. In going by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind,\nLenehan said. If I had poor luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of\nhis may serve me more propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar:\nMalachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the\nscarlet label. Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His\nsoul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision\nas to be born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to\nthe incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen?\nTheosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence\nEgyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of\nthe moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha\nof the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were\ntherefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second\nconstellation.",
        "However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him\nbeing in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was.\nentirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the\ncase at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above was going\non were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was\nas astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured\nthe contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong\nshop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring\nhard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co\nat Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others\nright opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to\nattract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance. He was\nsimply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known\nto himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the\nproceedings, after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days\nand the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own\nwhich the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.\nEventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn\non him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he\ninvoluntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took\nhold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the\nfluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it\nout with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of\nattentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about\nthe place.",
        "The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the\ncourse of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The\ndebaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the\nloftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne’s house had never beheld\nan assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of\nthat establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic. A\ngallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at the foot of the\ntable in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs\nof the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose\ncountenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature\nwisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the\neccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form\nof Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the\nhearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit\nof tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the\nprimrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John\nMulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a\nrefuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the\nconvivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of\nhim were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the\nhippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and\ncombat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose\nsteadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation\ncould ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the\ninspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.",
        "It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted\ntranscendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div. Scep.) contentions would\nappear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to\naccepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated,\ndeals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the\nstreet has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain\nthem as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which\nscience cannot answer–at present–such as the first problem submitted by\nMr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must\nwe accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the\npostmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of\nmales or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the\ndifferentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine,\nsuch as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and\nValenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation\n(one of nature’s favourite devices) between the NISUS FORMATIVUS of the\nnemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position,\nSUCCUBITUS FELIX of the passive element. The other problem raised by the\nsame inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting\nbecause, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but\nwe all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames\nthe sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract\nadenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk\nin dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered\nby our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all\ndenominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic\ncardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors\nand unfructified duennas–these, he said, were accountable for any and\nevery fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied,\nwould soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely\ngood music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures,\nplastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and\nApollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little\nattentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass\nthe intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc.\nBacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case\nof women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to\nmarital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect,\nprivate or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the\npractice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.\nAlthough the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too\ntrue the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the\nperitoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to\nlook into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off\nso well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human\nshortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious\nsuggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both\nnatality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution,\ntidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general,\neverything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of\nsome remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which\nbeautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet\nunascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of\nnormally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly\nlooked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other\nchildren of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s\nwords, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and\ncogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths\nare due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous\ngerms have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively\nshown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to\ndisappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement\nwhich, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the\nmaternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial\nto the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.\nMr S. Dedalus’ (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an\ninterruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute,\ndigest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with\npluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous\nfemales emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not\nto speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find\ngastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as\nnought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above\nalluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately\nacquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this\nmorbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening\nbumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from\nan alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that\nstaggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed\nvictuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly\ndropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom\n(Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons’ hall of the National\nMaternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well\nknown, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and\npopular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once\na woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s allusion, presumably,\nto one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature’s processes–\nthe act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as\nhe phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling\nrejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate\nand measured tone in which it was delivered.",
        "Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a\nhappy ACCOUCHEMENT. It had been a weary weary while both for patient and\ndoctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had\nmanfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she was\nvery very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are\nhappy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Reverently\nlook at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that\nlonging hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the\nfirst bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of\nthanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes\nbehold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady\nthere with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God’s\nclay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may\nwhisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of\nyears a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of\nthe Ulster bank, College Green branch.

Young hopeful will be\nchristened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr\nPurefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer’s office, Dublin Castle.

And Doady, knock the ashes from your\npipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you\n(may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the\nSacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to\nbed, to rest.

        "The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of\nthat false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied\ntrick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an\nunhealthiness, a FLAIR, for the cruder things of life. A scene disengages\nitself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so\nnatural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some\nthought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space of lawn one soft\nMay evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and\nwhite, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real\ninterest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or\ncollide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. And yonder\nabout that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful\nirrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and\ntheir darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then,\nOur Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear,\nbringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool\nardent fruit. A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but\nthere will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are\ngathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of\ngirlish fond hands. He frowns a little just as this young man does now\nwith a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs\nglance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the PIAZZETTA\ngiving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of\nreproach (ALLES VERGANGLICHE) in her glad look.",

        "Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the\nshavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up\ngenerally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. His\n(Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit\nunsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom\nin view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water\navailable for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an\nexpedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman’s\nshelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge\nwhere they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda\nor a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was\nrather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to\ntake some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means\nduring which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was\nrather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to\nget a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then\ncondition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always\nassuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly after a few\nsuch preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take\nup his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in\nthe shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more\nproperly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid\natmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where\nthey made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street\nround by the corner of Dan Bergin’s. But as he confidently anticipated\nthere was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except\na fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree,\noutside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a\nquarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional\nwhistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding\nhis arms arched over his head, twice.",
        "This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently\nthere was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it\nwhich they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the\nSignal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the\ndirection of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped\nby the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to\nvary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering\nthoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the\nmischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as\nit happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the\nrecent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where\nthe empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so\nhappened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s sandstrewer happened to be\nreturning and the elder man recounted to his companion A PROPOS of the\nincident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They\npassed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the\nstarting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at\nthat late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very\nenticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at\nnight) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into\nStore street, famous for its C division police station. Between this\npoint and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen\nthought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in\nhis mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the\nother who was acting as his FIDUS ACHATES inhaled with internal\nsatisfaction the smell of James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite\nclose to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily\nbread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most\nindispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where\nis fancy bread, at Rourke’s the baker’s it is said.",
        "EN ROUTE to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet\nperfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete\npossession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober,\nspoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame\nand swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not\nas a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for\nyoung fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking\nhabits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu\nfor every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could\nadminister a nasty kick if you didn’t look out. Highly providential was\nthe appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully\nunconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour\nthe finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the\naccident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the\ncourt next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old\nWall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when\nit got bruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of\nthose policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous\nin the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or\ntwo in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole\nthrough a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet\nparts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law\nwere well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect\nthe upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers\nwith firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time\nwhich was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any\nchance they fall out over anything. You frittered away your time, he very\nsensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the\nsquandermania of the thing, fast women of the DEMIMONDE ran away with a\nlot of l.s.d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you\ngot drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he\nrelished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and\nbloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy\nwhich he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point\nwhere he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round\nto say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.\nMost of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his\npubhunting CONFRERES but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part\nof his brother medicos under all the circs.",
        "–And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing\nwhatsoever of any kind.",
        "Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back\nof the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier\nof coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted\ntheir rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no\nspecial reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the\nlight emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure\nof the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began\nto remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having\nhappened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that\nhe recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father’s, Gumley. To\navoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.",
        "–Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.",
        "A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted\nagain, calling:",
        "–Night!",
        "Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the\ncompliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as\nhe always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless\nremained on the QUI VIVE with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish\nin the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not\nby any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on\nto be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by\nplacing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city\nproper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might\nbe hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever\nboodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice, your money or\nyour life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.",
        "Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though\nhe was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s breath\nredolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him and his\ngenealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of inspector\nCorley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a certain\nKatherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather Patrick\nMichael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there\nwhose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it (though\nnot proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de\nMalahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its\nkind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman,\nas the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being\nin service in the washkitchen. This therefore was the reason why the\nstill comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen\nwas spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.",
        "Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.\nNot as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings. His friends had\nall deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to\nStephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other\nuncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to\ntell him where on God’s earth he could get something, anything at all, to\ndo. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was\nfostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through\nthe mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if\nthe whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish.\nAnyhow he was all in.",
        "–I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows\nI’m on the rocks.",
        "–There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’\nschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You may\nmention my name.",
        "–Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man. I was\nnever one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck\ntwice in the junior at the christian brothers.",
        "–I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.",
        "Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do\nwith Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart\noff the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs\nMaloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but\nM’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in\nWinetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed\nof friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he hadn’t said a\nword about it.",
        "Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still\nStephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that\nCorley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving\nof much credence. However HAUD IGNARUS MALORUM MISERIS SUCCURRERE DISCO\netcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he\ngot paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which\nwas the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the\nwherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would\nget it out of Corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a\nthing to do but hand out the needful. Whereas. He put his hand in a\npocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he\nmight lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might\nendeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in\nthe negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken\nbiscuits were all the result of his investigation. He tried his hardest\nto recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or\nleft because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much\nthe reverse in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a\nthorough search though he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimly\nremembered. Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he\nbuy. However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the\ndark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.",
        "–Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.",
        "And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him\none of them.",
        "–Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman. I’ll pay you back one\ntime. Who’s that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in\nCamden street with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good word\nfor us to get me taken on there. I’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl\nin the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks, man. God,\nyou’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don’t\ngive a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.",
        "Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six\nhe got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky\nthat he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s,\nbookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara\nand a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he was lagged\nthe night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and\nrefusing to go with the constable.",
        "Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the\ncobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation\nwatchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was\nhaving a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own\nprivate account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time\nnow and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor\nas if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was\nnot in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.\nBeing a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in\npoint of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat\nand slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic\nimpecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of\nthat it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour\nall round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter\nof that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal\nservitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis\naltogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance\nintercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick\nthat was certainly.",
        "The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his\npractised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the\nblandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said,\nlaughingly, Stephen, that is:",
        "–He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named\nBoylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.",
        "At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr\nBloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the\ndirection of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,\nmoored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,\nwhereupon he observed evasively:",
        "–Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it\nhis face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much\ndid you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?",
        "–Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep\nsomewhere.",
        "–Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the\nintelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he\ninvariably does. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to\nhis deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a\nsmile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of the\nquestion. And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred\nat Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I don’t mean\nto presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you\nleave your father’s house?",
        "–To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.",
        "–I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom\ndiplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on\nyesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of\nconversation that he had moved.",
        "–I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.\nWhy?",
        "–A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than\none and a born RACONTEUR if ever there was one. He takes great pride,\nquite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he hasarded,\nstill thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when\nit was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that\nEnglish tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third\ncompanion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to\nthem to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.",
        "There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it\nwas, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his\nfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by\nthe ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell\ncocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he\ncould drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings\nthey had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and\nKatey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells\nand charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in\naccordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on\nthe days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or\nsomething like that.",
        "–No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust in\nthat boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr\nMulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. He\nknows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he\nnever realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you\ndidn’t notice as much as I did. But it wouldn’t occasion me the least\nsurprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in\nyour drink for some ulterior object.",
        "He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile\nallround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly\ncoming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair\nto enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony\nmedical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition\nto which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning\nby artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or\nMalahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed\nwhich he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a\nloss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he\nput it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.",
        "–Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking\nyour brains, he ventured to throw o.ut.",
        "The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by\nfriendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of\nfeatures did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the\nproblem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by\ntwo or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw\nthrough the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself\nallowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that effect\nand he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he\npossessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.",
        "Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round\nwhich a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting\nrid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly\nanimated way, there being some little differences between the parties.",
        "–Puttana Madonna, Che Ci Dia I Quattrini! Ho Ragione? Culo Rotto!",
        "–INTENDIAMOCI. MEZZO SOVRANO PIU ...",
        "–DICE LUI, PERO!",
        "–MEZZO.",
        "–FARABUTTO! MORTACCI SUI!",
        "–MA ASCOLTA! CINQUE LA TESTA PIU ...",
        "Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious\nwooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been\nbefore, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints\nanent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat\nFitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual\nfacts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few\nmoments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner\nonly to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection\nof waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus HOMO\nalready there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation\nfor whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.",
        "–Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to\nbreak the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape\nof solid food, say, a roll of some description.",
        "Accordingly his first act was with characteristic SANGFROID to order\nthese commodities quietly. The HOI POLLOI of jarvies or stevedores or\nwhatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes\napparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual\nportion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for\nsome appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the\nfloor. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having\njust a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be\nsure, rather in a quandary over VOGLIO, remarked to his PROTEGE in an\naudible tone of voice A PROPOS of the battle royal in the street which\nwas still raging fast and furious:",
        "–A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write\nyour poetry in that language? BELLA POETRIA! It is so melodious and full.\nBELLADONNA. VOGLIO.",
        "Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from\nlassitude generally, replied:",
        "–To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.",
        "–Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the\ninward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were\nabsolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds\nit.",
        "The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this TETE-A-TETE put a boiling\nswimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a\nrather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. After which he\nbeat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square\nlook at him later on so as not to appear to. For which reason he\nencouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by\nsurreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be\ncalled coffee gradually nearer him.",
        "–Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,\nlike names. Cicero, Podmore. Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.\nShakespeares were as common as Murphies. What’s in a name?",
        "–Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name\nwas changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.",
        "The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded\nStephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by\nasking:",
        "–And what might your name be?",
        "Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but\nStephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected\nquarter, answered:",
        "–Dedalus.",
        "The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather\nbunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and\nwater.",
        "–You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.",
        "–I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.",
        "Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently\neavesdropping too.",
        "–He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same\nway and nodding. All Irish.",
        "–All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.",
        "As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business\nand he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor\nof his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the\nremark:",
        "–I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his\nshoulder. The lefthand dead shot.",
        "Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures\nbeing also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.",
        "–Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.\nCocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.",
        "He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then he\nscrewed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night\nwith an unprepossessing cast of countenance.",
        "–Pom! he then shouted once.",
        "The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there\nbeing still a further egg.",
        "–Pom! he shouted twice.",
        "Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding\nbloodthirstily:",
        "  –BUFFALO BILL SHOOTS TO KILL,\n    NEVER MISSED NOR HE NEVER WILL.",
        "A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like\nasking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.",
        "–Beg pardon, the sailor said.",
        "–Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.",
        "–Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic\ninfluence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He\ntoured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus. I seen him do that in\nStockholm.",
        "–Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.",
        "–Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.\nKnow where that is?",
        "–Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.",
        "–That’s right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That’s\nwhere I hails from. I belongs there. That’s where I hails from. My little\nwoman’s down there. She’s waiting for me, I know. FOR ENGLAND, HOME AND\nBEAUTY. She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years now,\nsailing about.",
        "Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to\nthe mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy\nnight with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a number of\nstories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden\nand Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O’Leary, a\nfavourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey\nand a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way. Never about the runaway\nwife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The face at the\nwindow! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and\nthe awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his\naffections. You little expected me but I’ve come to stay and make a fresh\nstart. There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes\nme dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or\nTomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in\nshirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father. Broo! The\nwind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, POST MORTEM child. With a high\nro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the\ninevitable. Grin and bear it. I remain with much love your brokenhearted\nhusband D B Murphy.",
        "The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of\nthe jarvies with the request:",
        "–You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?",
        "The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of\nplug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was\npassed from hand to hand.",
        "–Thank you, the sailor said.",
        "He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow\nstammers, proceeded:",
        "–We come up this morning eleven o’clock. The threemaster ROSEVEAN from\nBridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon.\nThere’s my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.",
        "In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket\nand handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.",
        "–You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,\nleaning on the counter.",
        "–Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated\na bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and\nNorth America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage. I\nseen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the\nDardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled\na ship. I seen Russia. GOSPODI POMILYOU. That’s how the Russians prays.",
        "–You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.",
        "–Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queer\nthings too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor\nsame as I chew that quid.",
        "He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his\nteeth, bit ferociously:",
        "–Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and\nthe livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.",
        "He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to\nbe in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. The\nprinted matter on it stated: CHOZA DE INDIOS. BENI, BOLIVIA.",
        "All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage\nwomen in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,\nsleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of\nthem) outside some primitive shanties of osier.",
        "–Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like\nbreadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more\nchildren.",
        "See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver\nraw.",
        "His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for\nseveral minutes if not more.",
        "–Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.",
        "Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:",
        "–Glass. That boggles ’em. Glass.",
        "Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the\ncard to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as\nfollows: TARJETA POSTAL, SENOR A BOUDIN, GALERIA BECCHE, SANTIAGO, CHILE.\nThere was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. Though not\nan implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping\ntransaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don\nCesar de Bazan incident depicted in MARITANA on which occasion the\nformer’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having detected a\ndiscrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented\nhimself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the\ncompass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the\nmissive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s BONA FIDES\nnevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to\none day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via\nlong sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great\nextent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he\nhad consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead\nwhich was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a\npass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up\nwith the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did\ncome to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so\ndear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare\nto Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.\nThe trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in\nevery way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was\nout of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth,\nFalmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the\nsights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where\ndoubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of\nPark lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just struck him as a\nby no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see\nabout trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music\nembracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing\nand firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so\non, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots,\nwhich might prove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and\ncorner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy\ntype lend me your valise and I’ll post you the ticket. No, something top\nnotch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company\nwith his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to\nthe Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was\nquite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be\nmanaged by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the\nindispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. But who?\nThat was the rub.  Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a\ngreat field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to\nkeep pace with the times APROPOS of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which,\nit was mooted, was once more on the TAPIS in the circumlocution\ndepartments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of\neffete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there\ncertainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the\npublic at large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.",
        "It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no\nsmall blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the\nsystem really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry\npounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead\nof being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me\nfor a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum\nmonths of it and merited a radical change of VENUE after the grind of\ncity life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her\nspectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There\nwere equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island,\ndelightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of\nattractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around\nDublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was\na steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow,\nrightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly\nwheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal\nwhere if report spoke true the COUP D’OEIL was exceedingly grand though\nthe lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of\nvisitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal\nbenefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations\nand otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV, rhododendrons\nseveral hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts\nand conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy,\nthough it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design\nor accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only\nabout three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar. Because of course\nuptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to\nspeak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. Interesting to\nfathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was\nwhether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two\nsides in fact. He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and\npassed it along to Stephen.",
        "–I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had\nlittle pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and\nevery pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house,\nanother was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the\nchinks does.",
        "Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the\nglobetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.",
        "–And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his\nback. Knife like that.",
        "Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in\nkeeping with his character and held it in the striking position.",
        "–In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow\nhid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. PREPARE TO MEET YOUR\nGOD, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.",
        "His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further\nquestions even should they by any chance want to.",
        "–That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable\nSTILETTO.",
        "After which harrowing DENOUEMENT sufficient to appal the stoutest he\nsnapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in\nhis chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.",
        "–They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in\nthe dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought the\npark murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them\nusing knives.",
        "At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS\nMr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively\nexchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly ENTRE\nNOUS variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, ALIAS the keeper, not\nturning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. His\ninscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in\nitself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t\nunderstand one jot of what was going on. Funny, very!",
        "There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and\nstarts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the\nnatives CHOZA DE, another the seaman’s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he\nwas personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly\nrecollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as\nyesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land\ntroubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively\nspeaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was\njust turned fifteen.",
        "–Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.",
        "The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.",
        "–Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.",
        "The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or\nno.",
        "–Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he\nhad, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but\nhe failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust,\nand shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.",
        "–What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the\nboats?",
        "Our SOI-DISANT sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:",
        "–I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.\nSalt junk all the time.",
        "Tired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not\nlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,\nfell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the\nglobe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it\ncovered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what\nit meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen at the\nlowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated\nold salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly\nredolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him,\ndreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. And\nit left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find out the secret\nfor himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of\nthing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.\nAnd the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at\nall. Nevertheless, without going into the MINUTIAE of the business, the\neloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the\nnatural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in\nthe face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually\ncontrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell\nidea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same\nlines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a\nhighly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where\nliving inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to\nthem like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and\ncoastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid\nthe elements whatever the season when duty called IRELAND EXPECTS THAT\nEVERY MAN and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the\nwintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to\ncapsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had\nexperienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.",
        "–There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself\na rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s\nvalet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave\nme an oilskin and that jackknife. I’m game for that job, shaving and\nbrushup. I hate roaming about. There’s my son now, Danny, run off to sea\nand his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be\ndrawing easy money.",
        "–What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side,\nbore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from\nthe carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and\na strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.",
        "–Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?\nHe’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.",
        "The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt\nwith his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be\nseen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an\nanchor.",
        "–There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts. I\nmust get a wash tomorrow or next day. It’s them black lads I objects to.\nI hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.",
        "Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his\nshirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the\nmariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young\nman’s sideface looking frowningly rather.",
        "–Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were Iying\nbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the\nname of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.",
        "–Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.",
        "That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the. Someway\nin his. Squeezing or.",
        "–See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And\nthere he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his\nfingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.",
        "And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did\nactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the\nunreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this time\nstretched over.",
        "–Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He’s gone\ntoo. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.",
        "He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression\nof before.",
        "–Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.",
        "–And what’s the number for? loafer number two queried.",
        "–Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.",
        "–Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with\nsome sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of\nthe questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.",
        "And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged\nend:",
        "    –AS BAD AS OLD ANTONIO,\n    FOR HE LEFT ME ON MY OWNIO.",
        "The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat\npeered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her\nown with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom,\nscarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied\nbut outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the\nAbbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he\npicked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink. His\nreason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the\nsame face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond\nquay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady\nin the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of\nhis washing. Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your\nwashing. Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s\nundergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a\nman’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink\n(hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me,\nlove my dirty shirt. Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired\nthe female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief\nwhen the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side\nof the Evening Telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face\nround the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing\nthat she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the\ngroup of gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was\nno more of her.",
        "–The gunboat, the keeper said.",
        "–It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how\na wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease\ncan be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if\nhe values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course I\nsuppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Still no\nmatter what the cause is from ...",
        "Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:",
        "–In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a\nroaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy\nthe soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.",
        "The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude,\nsaid it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop\nto INSTANTER to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any\noldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, w ere not\nlicensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he\ncould truthfully state, he, as a PATERFAMILIAS, was a stalwart advocate\nof from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort,\nhe said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon\non everybody concerned.",
        "–You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe\nin the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as\ndistinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I\nbelieve in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as\nthe convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such\ninventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?",
        "Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try\nand concentrate and remember before he could say:",
        "–They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and\ntherefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the\npossibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can\nhear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other\npractical jokes, CORRUPTIO PER SE and CORRUPTIO PER ACCIDENS both being\nexcluded by court etiquette.",
        "Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the\nmystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he\nfelt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:",
        "–Simple? I shouldn’t think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant\nyou, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue\nmoon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance\nto invent those rays Rontgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I\nbelieve it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same\napplies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon\nsuch as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you\nbelieve in the existence of a supernatural God.",
        "–O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several\nof the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial\nevidence.",
        "On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they\nwere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in\ntheir respective ages, clashed.",
        "–Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his\noriginal point with a smile of unbelief. I’m not so sure about that.\nThat’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the\nsectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you IN TOTO there.\nMy belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine\nforgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big\nquestion of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like\nHAMLET and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better\nthan I, of course I needn’t tell you. Can’t you drink that coffee, by the\nway? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It’s like one of our\nskipper’s bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what he hasn’t got. Try\na bit.",
        "–Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the\nmoment refusing to dictate further.",
        "Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir\nor try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something\napproaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and\nlucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or\nnay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in\nrun on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings\nand useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower\norders. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they\npaid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated\nwith it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her\npianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do\ngood and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. Sulphate\nof copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered\nreading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when\nit was or where. Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables\nseemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the\nvogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis\ninvolved.",
        "–Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being\nstirred.",
        " Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug\nfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and\ntook a sip of the offending beverage.",
        "–Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid\nfood, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but\nregular meals as the SINE QUA NON for any kind of proper work, mental or\nmanual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.",
        "–Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that\nknife. I can’t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.",
        "Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article,\na blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or\nantique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least\nconspicuous point about it.",
        "–Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom APROPOS of\nknives remarked to his CONFIDANTE SOTTO VOCE. Do you think they are\ngenuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and\nlie like old boots. Look at him.",
        "Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full\nof a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was\nquite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire\nfabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability\nin all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.",
        "He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and\nSherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a\nwellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,\nthere was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail\ndelivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate\nsuch a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He\nmight even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told,\nas people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and\nhad served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say\nnothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage\nof identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who\nexpiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. On the\nother hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because\nmeeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting\nnews from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean\nseas to draw the long bow about the schooner HESPERUS and etcetera. And\nwhen all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t\nprobably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows\ncoined about him.",
        "–Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.\nAnalogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants, though\nthat is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget\nqueen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as\nthey are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten their legs\nif you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded,\nindicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever\nyou like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from\nsitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. There’s an\nexample again of simple souls.",
        "However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who\nreminded him a bit of Ludwig, ALIAS Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards\nof the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the\nFLYING DUTCHMAN, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in\nlarge numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any\nsort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as\nalso did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it,\nhe conceded. On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in\nkeeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to\nadmit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the\nchip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the\nCoombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too\ngiven to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline\npersuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin\nwith garlic DE RIGUEUR off him or her next day on the quiet and, he\nadded, on the cheap.",
        "–Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like\nthat, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own\nhands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they\ncarry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My\nwife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could\nactually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in\n(technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite\ndark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate\naccounts for character. That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry\nin Italian.",
        "–The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very\npassionate about ten shillings. ROBERTO RUBA ROBA SUA.",
        "–Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.",
        "–Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown\nlistener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles\ntriangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso\nMastino.",
        "–It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the\nblood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street\nmuseum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I\nwas just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions\nof hips, bosom. You simply don’t knock against those kind of women here.\nAn exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but\nwhat I’m talking about is the female form. Besides they have so little\ntaste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman’s natural\nbeauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly\nis, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing I simply hate to see.",
        "Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the\nothers got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, goo\ncollisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course had\nhis own say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered\na monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils\nof the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to\nthat effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.",
        "So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck\nof that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the\nmoment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell\nremembered it PALME on Booterstown strand. That was the talk of the town\nthat year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of\ndistinctive merit on the topic for the Irish TIMES), breakers running\nover her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with\nhorror. Then someone said something about the case of the S. S. LADY\nCAIRNS of Swansea run into by the MONA which was on an opposite tack in\nrather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid was\ngiven. Her master, the MONA’S, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead\nwould give way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.",
        "At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him to\nunfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.",
        "–Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just\ngently dropping off into a peaceful doze.",
        "He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,\nstepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore\ndue left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who\nnoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum\nsticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his\nburning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and,\napplying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of\nit with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd\nsuspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the\ncounterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to\nall intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly\nrefreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders\nof the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all\nradically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person\nor persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the\ncleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief\nspace of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently\ngiving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his\nbilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it\napparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped anyway for new\nfoothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his\nsentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation\nstones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other\nin stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish\nrates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from\ndictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his\nbox before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly\namazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most\nrespectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his\nlife who came in for a cool 100 pounds a year at one time which of course\nthe doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.\nAnd there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the\ntown tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver. He drank needless to be\ntold and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be\nin a large way of business if–a big if, however–he had contrived to\ncure himself of his particular partiality.",
        "All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,\ncoastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same\nthing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin,\nthe only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no\nships ever called.",
        "There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently AU\nFAIT.",

There would\nbe a fall and the greatest fall in history. The Germans and the Japs were\ngoing to have their little lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the\nbeginning of the end. Brummagem England was toppling already and her\ndownfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them\nabout the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his\nauditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by\nshowing the tendon referred to on his boot. His advice to every Irishman\nwas: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for\nIreland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.",

        "From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was\nrather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,\npending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was\nfully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel,\nunless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather\nconcealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with\nthe quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the\ncoal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went\non, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say\non the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to\nthe issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to\ntry to make the most of both countries even though poles apart. Another\nlittle interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in\ncommon parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for\nEngland as against her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene\nbetween the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or\nhave been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously\nbogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence\ntrick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student\nof the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And\nas for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all,\nhe (B.) couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give\npeople like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether\nand refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private\nlife and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a\nDannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like\nDenis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from\nthat he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet,\nthough such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom\nin any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while\ninwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man\nwho had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his\npolitical convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to\nany such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south,\nhave her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words\npassed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky\nmortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his\nadored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial LIAISON by plunging\nhis knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-\nthe-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage\nand so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush\nwhich, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin\non. In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our\nfriend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his\nwelcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.\nLike actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up\nsmiling again. Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no\neconomising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the\nshadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever\ngot rid of some l s d. in the course of his perambulations round the\ndocks in the congenial atmosphere of the OLD IRELAND tavern, come back to\nErin and so on. Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the\nsame identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually\nsilenced the offender.",
        "–He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the\nwhole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and in\na heated fashion offensively.

History, would\nyou be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the\ninquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an\nuncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for,\nimported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. They\nare practical and are proved to be so. I don’t want to indulge in any\nbecause you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as\nyou are. But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest\nspells poverty.

Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say\nthe words the voice he heard said, if you work.",

        "–I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest\npossible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the\nthing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.\nThat’s work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of\nyou, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to\nrecoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit as much right\nto live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.\nWhat? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is\nequally important.",
        "–You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may\nbe 1160 important because I belong to the FAUBOURG SAINT PATRICE called\nIreland for short.",
        "–I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.",
        "–But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important\nbecause it belongs to me.",
        "–What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under\nsome misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the latter\nportion. What was it you ...?",
        "Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of\ncoffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:  1170",
        "–We can’t change the country. Let us change the subject.",
        "At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down\nbut in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put\non belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some kind was\nclearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy\nspoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his\nsober state. Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost\nimportance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been\nfamiliarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear for the\nyoung man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some\nconsternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more\nespecially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw\nmuch light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of\ncultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of\npremature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance there\nwas the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably\nconnected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose\nother gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody\nall round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit\nof brown paper (a fact). And then the usual DENOUEMENT after the fun had\ngone on fast and furious he got 1190 landed into hot water and had to be\nspirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from\nJohn Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under\nsection two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those\nsubpoenaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur\nto anyone with a pick of brains.

Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of\ntruth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly\ninadvisable, all things considered.

        "This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair\namount of laughter among his ENTOURAGE. As regards Bloom he, without the\nfaintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door\nand reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary\ninterest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made\npublic with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full\nof sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened\nand an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to\na climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering\nblow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however,\nwho were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was\npublic property all along though not to anything like the sensational\nextent that it subsequently blossomed into. Since their names were\ncoupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the\nparticular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the\nhousetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came\nout in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court\nliterally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to\nhaving witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of\nscrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder\nin night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact\nthe weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of\nmoney out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a\ncase of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common\nbetween them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene,\nstrong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and\nforgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s\nsmiles. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say,\ncropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in\nthe case, exist between married folk? Poser. Though it was no concern of\ntheirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a\nwave of folly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented\nobviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military\nsupernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday FAREWELL, MY\nGALLANT CAPTAIN kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the l8th\nhussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader,\nthat is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course,\nwoman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which\nhe almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as\na whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants\nfor whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by\ntaking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most\nsanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose,\nthereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the\nfabled ass’s kick. Looking back now in a retrospective kind of\narrangement all seemed a kind of dream. And then coming back was the\nworst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel\nout of place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected,\nIrishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of\nyears looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside\non the north side. North or south, however, it was just the wellknown\ncase of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a\nvengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was\nSpanish or half so, types that wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate\nabandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.",
        "–Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to\nStephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don’t greatly mistake she was\nSpanish too.",
        "–The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or\nother rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and\nthe first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and\nso many.",
        "–Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any\nmeans, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it\nwas as she lived there. So, Spain.",
        "Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket SWEETS OF, which reminded him by\nthe by of that Cap l street library book out of date, he took out his\npocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly\nfinally he.",
        "–Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded\nphoto which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?",
        "Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large\nsized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she\nwas in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously\nlow for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than\nvision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing\nnear, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was IN OLD\nMADRID, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her\n(the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about\nsomething to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin’s\npremier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic\nexecution.",
        "–Mrs Bloom, my wife the PRIMA DONNA Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom\nindicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like her\nthen.",
        "Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his 1440\nlegal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major\nBrian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a\nsinger having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered\nbarely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking likeness in\nexpression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a\nlot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in\nthat getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the\nensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt, being\na bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general\ndevelopmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon\nhe had seen those Grecian statues, 1450 perfectly developed as works of\nart, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders,\nback, all the symmetry, all the rest. Yes, puritanisme, it does though\nSaint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop. Whereas\nno photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word.",
        "The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s good\nexample and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for\nitself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for\nhimself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the\ncamera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional\netiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet\nwonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.\nAnd he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind\nof inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.\nNevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased\nby opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away\nthoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s\npossible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving EMBONPOINT.\nIn fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen\nslightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.\nSuppose she was gone when he? I looked for the lamp which she told me\ncame into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then\nrecollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby\nwith met him pike hoses (SIC) in it which must have fell down\nsufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies\nto Lindley Murray.",
        "The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, DISTINGUE\nand impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though\nyou wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would. Besides he said the\npicture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the\nmoment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of\nmakebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur\nwith the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial\ntangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage\nfavourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole\nbusiness. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between\nthe two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in\ncourt with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising\nexpressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or\nthree times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when\nthe thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. Then the\ndecree NISI and the King’s proctor tries to show cause why and, he\nfailing to quash it, NISI was made absolute. But as for that the two\nmisdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could\nsafely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was\nput in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party\nwronged in due course. He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to\nErin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the\nhistoric FRACAS when the fallen leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his\nguns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery,\n(leader’s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly\neven more than that penetrated into the printing works of the\nINSUPPRESSIBLE or no it was UNITED IRELAND (a by no means by the by\nappropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or\nsomething like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the\nfacile pens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation\nreflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals. Though palpably a\nradically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly\ngarbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way\nwith the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture\nthat their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which\nshe, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot\ntimes in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a\nnasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated\nlodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a\ngrave character. His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked\noff and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it\nup in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to\nhim (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting\nand hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time\nall the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a\nmatter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than\nanything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at\nhis mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at\nonce because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect\nAPLOMB, saying: THANK YOU, SIR, though in a very different tone of voice\nfrom the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set\nto rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with\na difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him\nalone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to\nthe grave.",
        "On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes\nof the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing 1530\nimmoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the\nwherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case\nfor the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate\nhusband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from\nthe usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial\nmoment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms, drawing\nattention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic\nrumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master\nupon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his\nvisits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter\nand let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with\nher tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there\nwere several others. He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed\nand didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men\nin the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a\nlady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on\nfairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her\nduties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little\nflutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with\nimproper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another,\nthe cause of many LIAISONS between still attractive married women getting\non for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases\nof feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.",
        "It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of\nbrains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time\nwith profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him\nhis lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take\nunto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim\nladies’ society was a CONDITIO SINE QUA NON though he had the gravest\npossible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about\nMiss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought\nhim down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would\nfind much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the\ncompany of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly\nwith the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out\nleading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs. To think of him\nhouse and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother,\nwas really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out\nwith attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or\nlike his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even\nwere it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or,\nfailing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.",
        "–At what o’clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired\nthough unwrinkled face.",
        "–Some time yesterday, Stephen said.",
        "–Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow\nFriday. Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!",
        "–The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.",
        "Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. Though\nthey didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow\nwas as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train\nof thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of\nyears previously when he had been a QUASI aspirant to parliamentary\nhonours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect\n(which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking\nregard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the evicted tenants\nquestion, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people’s mind\nthough, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his\nfaith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn’t exactly hold\nwater, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough\nsympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion\n(a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently\npartially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than\nMichael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a\nbacktothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo\nput upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of\nthe clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that he, though often considerably\nmisunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated,\ndeparted from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the\ngizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only\ntoo conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and\ndisplays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as\na foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the\nfittest, in a word.",
        "Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was,\nit was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit\nrisky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody\nhaving a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on\nthe night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame\npaw (not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he\nhad hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly\nremembered, having been there, so to speak. On the other hand it was\naltogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove\nsuggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two\nalternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail\nhimself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. His\ninitial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive\nbut it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn’t what you call jump\nat the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn’t\nknow how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain\nthe proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he\nwould allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found\nsuitable. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the\nnonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the\nnight plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at\nleast he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he\nfailed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the\nproviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be made\nbecause that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to\nbe glued to the spot, didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his\nway home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some\nsponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff\nstreet lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s\nwhereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings\n(the mermaids’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the\ntropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling\ntheir largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the\naccompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about\nhimself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and\naddress, as Mr Algebra remarks PASSIM. At the same time he inwardly\nchuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about\nhis god being a jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but\nwhat properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable\npoint too of tender Achilles. Your god was a jew.

        "–I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while\nprudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come\nhome with me and talk things over.

        "The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain\nsailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper\nof the shanty who didn’t seem to.",
        "–Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that\nBrazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.",

        "To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to\nrise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and\nforemost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the\noccasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host\nas a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not\nlooking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand\ntotal of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four\ncoppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously\nspotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in\nunmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well\nworth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.",
        "–Come, he counselled to close the SEANCE.",
        "Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter\nor shanty together and the ELITE society of oilskin and company whom\nnothing short of an earthquake would move out of their DOLCE FAR NIENTE.\nStephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at\nthe, for a moment, the door.",
        "–One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the\nmoment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside\ndown, on the tables in cafes. To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom\nreplied without a moment’s hesitation, saying straight off:",
        "–To sweep the floor in the morning.",
        "So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time\napologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the bye,\nhis right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night\nair was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on\nhis pins.",
        "–It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a\nmoment. The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man. Come.\nIt’s not far. Lean on me.",
        "Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on\naccordingly.",
        "–Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind\nof flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all\nthat.",
        "Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where the\nmunicipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes\nwrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh\nfields and pastures new. And APROPOS of coffin of stones the analogy was\nnot at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of\nseventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of\nthe split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame\nevicted tenants he had put in their holdings.",
        "So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom,\nas a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm\nin arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand\nin its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first\ngo-off but the music of Mercadante’s HUGUENOTS, Meyerbeer’s SEVEN LAST\nWORDS ON THE CROSS and Mozart’s TWELFTH MASS he simply revelled in, the\nGLORIA in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such,\nliterally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. He infinitely\npreferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the\nopposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey\nhymns or BID ME TO LIVE AND I WILL LIVE THY PROTESTANT TO BE. He also\nyielded to none in his admiration of Rossini’s STABAT MATER, a work\nsimply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion\nTweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly\nadding to her other laureis and putting the others totally in the shade,\nin the jesuit fathers’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred\nedifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or\nVIRTUOSI rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to\ncome up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a\nsacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On\nthe whole though favouring preferably light opera of the DON GIOVANNI\ndescription and MARTHA, a gem in its line, he had a PENCHANT, though with\nonly a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as\nMendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about\nthe old favourites, he mentioned PAR EXCELLENCE Lionel’s air in MARTHA,\nM’APPARI, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more\naccurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips\nof Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number,\nin fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to\na politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but launched out into\npraises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or about that period, the\nlutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who\nANNO LUDENDO HAUSI, DOULANDUS, an instrument he was contemplating\npurchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though\nthe name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby\nand son with their DUX and COMES conceits and Byrd (William) who played\nthe virginals, he said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found\nthem and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.",
        "On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond\nthe swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,\nbrushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not\nperfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive\nguineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political\ncelebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a\nstriking coincidence.",
        "By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom,\nwho was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s sleeve\ngently, jocosely remarking:",
        "–Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.",
        "They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth\nanything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite\nnear so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh\nbecause palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a\ntaildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the\nlord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a\ngood poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely\nreflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might\ncrop up. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse,\nwithout a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected, take\nthat mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the same size, would be a holy\nhorror to face. But it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was\nbuilt that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into\npotheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained,\nnothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale with a harpoon\nhairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke,\nchalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. These timely\nreflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat\ndistracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was\nmanoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.",
        "–What’s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging IN\nMEDIAS RES, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your\nacquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.",
        "He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,\nimage of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome\nblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as\nhe was perhaps not that way built.",
        "Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it\nopened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish industries,\nconcert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.",
        "Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air YOUTH HERE HAS END\nby Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come\nfrom. Even more he liked an old German song of JOHANNES JEEP about the\nclear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled\nBloom a bit:",

        "These opening bars he sang and translated EXTEMPORE. Bloom, nodding, said\nhe perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he\ndid.",
        "A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,\nwhich Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily,\nif properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such\nas Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its\nown price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate\npossessor in the near future an ENTREE into fashionable houses in the\nbest residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of\nbusiness and titled people where with his university degree of B. A. (a\nhuge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the\ngood impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being\nblessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and\nother requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the\nbetter worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in–\nsociety’s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like\nthat could militate against you. It was in fact only a matter of months\nand he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and\nartistic CONVERSAZIONES during the festivities of the Christmas season,\nfor choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and\nbeing made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he\nhappened to know, were on record–in fact, without giving the show away,\nhe himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added to\nwhich of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be\nsneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he\nparenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily\nembrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of\ntime. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and\nboth monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in\nthe smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a\ncheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though\ntaste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that,\ndifferent from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as\nit would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the usual\nhackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan\nSt Austell and Hilton St Just and their GENUS OMNE. Yes, beyond a shadow\nof a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital\nopening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s\nesteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a\ngrand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup,\nif one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big IF,\nhowever, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable\nprocrastination which often tripped -up a too much feted prince of good\nfellows. And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his\nown master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his\nspare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his\nvocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a\nmatter for himself alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that\nwas the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose\nfor smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.",
        "The horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he\npurposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on\nthe FOOLS STEP IN WHERE ANGELS principle, advising him to sever his\nconnection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone\nto disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when\nnot present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in\nBloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s\ncharacter, no pun intended.",
        "The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and,\nrearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on\nthe floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking\nglobes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full\ncrupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had\nended, patient in his scythed car.",
        "Side by side Bloom, profiting by the CONTRETEMPS, with Stephen passed\nthrough the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over\na strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen\nsinging more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.",
        "    Und Alle Schiffe Brucken.",
        "The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely\nwatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one\nfull, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, TO BE MARRIED BY FATHER\nMAHER. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing\ntheir TETE-A-TETE (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens\nenemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the\nsame category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in\nthe sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in\nany case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in\nhis seat near the end of lower Gardiner street AND LOOKED AFTER THEIR\nLOWBACKED CAR.",
        "What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?",
        "Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they\nfollowed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and\nMountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,\nGardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of\nTemple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing\nright, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching,\ndisparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before\nGeorge’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than\nthe arc which it subtends.",
        "Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?",
        "Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,\nprostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and\nglowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed\ncorporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,\necclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the\nstudy of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the\npresabbath, Stephen’s collapse.",
        "Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective\nlike and unlike reactions to experience?",
        "Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to\nplastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner\nof life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both\nindurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of\nheterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox\nreligious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the\nalternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual\nmagnetism.",
        "Were their views on some points divergent?",
        "Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of dietary\nand civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s views on\nthe eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom\nassented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved\nin assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to\nchristianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,\nson of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of\nLeary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (died\n266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and\ninterred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric\ninanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of\nadulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and\nthe velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen\nattributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both\nfrom two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first\nno bigger than a woman’s hand.",
        "Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?",
        "The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining\nparaheliotropic trees.",
        "Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in\nthe past?",
        "In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public\nthoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and Leonard’s\ncorner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.",
        "In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall\nbetween Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of\nUppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and\nprospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class\nrailway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian\nTweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on\nthe lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once\nin 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour\nof his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street, west.",
        "What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,\n1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their\ndestination?",
        "He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual\ndevelopment and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction\nof the converse domain of interindividual relations.",
        "As in what ways?",
        "From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:\nexistence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence\nto nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.",
        "What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?",
        "At the housesteps of the 4th Of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number\n7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket\nof his trousers to obtain his latchkey.",
        "Was it there?",
        "It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on\nthe day but one preceding.",
        "Why was he doubly irritated?",
        "Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded\nhimself twice not to forget.",
        "What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively)\nand inadvertently, keyless couple?",
        "To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.",
        "Bloom’s decision?",
        "A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area\nrailings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower\nunion of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of\nfive feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the\narea pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating\nhimself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of\nthe fall.",
        "Did he fall?",
        "By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois\nmeasure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical\nselfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist\nof 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to\nwit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine\nhundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six\nhundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and\ntwentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C\nB, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.",
        "Did he rise uninjured by concussion?",
        "Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by\nthe impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at\nits freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its\nfulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent\nscullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal\ngas by turningon the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he\nreduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.",
        "What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?",
        "Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent\nkitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a\ncandle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man\nleaving the kitchen holding a candle.",
        "Did the man reappear elsewhere?",
        "After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible\nthrough the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the\nhalldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space\nof the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.",
        "Did Stephen obey his sign?",
        "Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed\nsoftly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted\ncandle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a\nturning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom’s\nhouse.",
        "What did Bloom do?",
        "He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its\nflame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen\nwith its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary,\nknelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped\nsticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram\ncoal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and\nM’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of\npaper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential\nenergy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements\nto enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.",
        "Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?",
        "Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,\nhad kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the\ncollege of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county\nof Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his\nfirst residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his\ngodmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia\nMorkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard)\nGoulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil street: of\nhis mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve\nNorth Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier\n1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics’ theatre of\nuniversity College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of his sister Dilly\n(Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra.",
        "What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the\nfire towards the opposite wall?",
        "Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,\nstretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the\nchimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded\nunattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’\ngrey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position\nclamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the\nthird at their point of junction.",
        "What did Bloom see on the range?",
        "On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left\n(larger) hob a black iron kettle.",
        "What did Bloom do at the range?",
        "He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle\nto the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it\nflow.",
        "Did it flow?",
        "Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of\n2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of\nfilter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant\ncost of 5 pounds per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of\nthe Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a\ndistance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving\ntanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge,\nupper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply\nof 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the\noverflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks\nengineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of the waterworks\ncommittee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other\nthan those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being\nhad to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893)\nparticularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration\nof 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had\nbeen convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of\ntheir meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr\nIgnatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another\nsection of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.",
        "What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,\nreturning to the range, admire?",
        "Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in\nseeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s\nprojection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific\nexceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface\nparticles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence\nof its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic\nquiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides:\nits subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar\nicecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance:\nits preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its\nindisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region\nbelow the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability\nof its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and\nhold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the\nmost precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its\npersistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and\ndownwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and\nvolume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns:\nits gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones:\nits vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and\nconfluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic\ncurrents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in\nseaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,\nfreshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,\ncataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its\nvast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and\nlatent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and\nexemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate,\nsaturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its\ncomposition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part\nof oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead\nSea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate\ndams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst\nand fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and\nparagon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow,\nhail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and\nbays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and\narchipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and\narms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility\nin working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power\nstations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals,\nrivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality\nderivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to\nlevel: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe),\nnumerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity\nas constituting 90 percent of the human body: the noxiousness of its\neffluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater,\nstagnant pools in the waning moon.",
        "Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he\nreturn to the stillflowing tap?",
        "To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington’s\nlemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours\npreviously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold\nneverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long\nredbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.",
        "What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer?",
        "That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by\nsubmersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month\nof October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of\nglass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.",
        "What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and\nprophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a\npreliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid\nsplashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case\nof sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to\ncold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?",
        "The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.",
        "What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?",
        "Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric\nenergy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the\nlastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.",
        "Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?",
        "Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and\nrecuperation.",
        "What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the\nagency of fire?",
        "The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of\nventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was\ncommunicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses\nof bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated\nfossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their\nvegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant),\ntransmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.

        "What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?",
        "A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at\nboth sides simultaneously.",
        "For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?",
        "To shave himself.",
        "What advantages attended shaving by night?",
        "A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from\nshave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly\nencountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours:\nquiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when\nawaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and\nperturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman’s double knock, a paper\nread, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a\nshoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might\ncause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with\nprecision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.",
        "Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?",

        "What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting\ninfluence?",
        "The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human\nblood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural\norder, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.",
        "What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the\nkitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?",
        "On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal\nbreakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a\nmoustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white\ngoldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper,\nand a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.

On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various\nsizes and proveniences.",
        "What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?",
        "Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,\nnumbered 8 87, 88 6.",
        "What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?",
        "Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative\nof the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive\nresult of which he had read in the EVENING TELEGRAPH, late pink edition,\nin the cabman’s shelter, at Butt bridge.",

        "What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?",
        "The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event\nfollowed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the\nelectrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by\nfailure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding\noriginally from a successful interpretation.",
        "His mood?",
        "He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he\nwas satisfied.",
        "What satisfied him?",
        "To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to\nothers. Light to the gentiles.",
        "How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?",
        "He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps’s\nsoluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed\non the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the\nprescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity\nprescribed.",
        "What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his\nguest?",
        "Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation\nCrown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he\nsubstituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served\nextraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the\nviscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion\n(Molly).",
        "Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of\nhospitality?",
        "His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted\nthem seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps’s massproduct,\nthe creature cocoa.",
        "Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,\nreserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to\ncomplete the act begun?",
        "The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right\nside of his guest’s jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady’s\nhandkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.",
        "Who drank more quickly?",
        "Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking,\nfrom the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady\nflow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent’s one, six to two,\nnine to three.",
        "What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?",
        "Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was\nengaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from\nliterature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had\napplied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the\nsolution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.",

        "Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?",
        "Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of\nbossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual\nchanges of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,\nvelocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round\nand round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.",

Substituting Bloom for\nStephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,\njunior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the\nmatriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the\nroyal university.",
        "Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university\nof life?",
        "Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had\nor had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.",
        "What two temperaments did they individually represent?",
        "The scientific. The artistic.",

        "Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a\nstate of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his\nappreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once\nrevolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting\ntelescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water\nsiphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.",
        "Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of\nkindergarten?",
        "Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,\ncatapults.

She understood little of political complications,\ninternal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of\nbills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of\nlaconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of\ncalligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of\ncopperas, green vitriol and nutgall.

        "He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the\nincitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the\npropagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of\nopulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of\natavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,\nhypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.",
        "From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not\ntotally immune?",
        "From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his\nsleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite\ntime incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once,\nsleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a\nheatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled,\nunheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.",
        "Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member\nof his family?",
        "Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent\n(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation\nof terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night\nattire with a vacant mute expression.",
        "What other infantile memories had he of her?",
        "15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and\nlessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her\nmoneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a\ndoll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had\nblond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian\narmy, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.",
        "What endemic characteristics were present?",
        "Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line\nof lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals\nto more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.",
        "What memories had he of her adolescence?",
        "She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke’s lawn,\nentreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and\ntake away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South\nCircular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of\nsinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly\nback (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary\nof her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making\na brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).",
        "Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?",
        "Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.",
        "What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,\nif differently?",
        "A temporary departure of his cat.",
        "Why similarly, why differently?",
        "Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male",
        "(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because\nof different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.",
        "In other respects were their differences similar?",
        "In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in\nunexpectedness.",
        "As?",
        "Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for\nher (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in\nStephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit,\ndescribing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy\nof its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf\nmousewatching cat).",
        "Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences\nof a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf\nearwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an\nunspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been\nJoseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it\n(he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat). Hence, in\npassivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness,\ntheir differences were similar.",

        "She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him\na breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware. She\nprovided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been\nmade by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities,\nanticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been\nexplained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess\nwithout gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the\nquarter, a thousandth part.",
        "What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make\nto Stephen, noctambulist?",
        "To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and\nFriday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately\nabove the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of\nhis host and hostess.",
        "What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation\nof such an extemporisation?",
        "For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host:\nrejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess:\ndisintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian\npronunciation.",
        "Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a\nhostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent\neventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s\ndaughter?",

        "What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually\nselfexcluding propositions?",
        "The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler’s\ncircus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured\nclown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in\nthe auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly\ndeclared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown’s)\npapa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he\n(Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge\nand tendered it m payment of an account due to and received by J. and T.\nDavy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on\nthe waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.",

        "No.",
        "Had Bloom’s coin returned?",
        "Never.",
        "Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?",
        "Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to\namend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and\ninternational animosity.",
        "He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating\nthese conditions?",
        "There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct\nfrom human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of\ndestruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of\nthe ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and\ndeath: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human\nfemales extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable\naccidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies\nand their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital\ncriminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make\nterror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of\nwhich are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth,\nthrough convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to\ndecay.",
        "Why did he desist from speculation?",
        "Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other\nmore acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena\nto be removed.",
        "Did Stephen participate in his dejection?",
        "He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding\nsyllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational\nreagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the\nincertitude of the void.",
        "Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?",
        "Not verbally. Substantially.",

        "That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from\nthe unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.",

        "What did each do at the door of egress?",
        "Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.",
        "For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?",
        "For a cat.",
        "What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest,\nemerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere\nof the house into the penumbra of the garden?",
        "The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.",
        "With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his\ncompanion of various constellations?",
        "Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in\nincipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous\nscintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an\nobserver placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft\ndeep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius\n(alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant\nand in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the\nprecession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and\nnebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund\nand of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging\ntowards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic\ndrift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from\nimmeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with\nwhich the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a\nparenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.",
        "Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?",
        "Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the\nearth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in\ncavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of\nmicrobes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable\ntrillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by\ncohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of\nhuman serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes\nof void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its\nuniverse of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible\nin divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever\ndiminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried\nfar enough, nought nowhere was never reached.",
        "Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?",
        "Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of\nthe quadrature of the circle he had learned of .the existence of a number\ncomputed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of\nso many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the\nresult having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages\neach of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be\nrequisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed\nintegers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds\nof thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions,\nthe nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing\nsuccinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic\nelaboration of any power of any of its powers.",
        "Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their\nsatellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and\nmoral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?",
        "Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,\nnormally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when\nelevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere\nsuffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the\nline of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated\nfrom nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing\nthis problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis\nwhich could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and\ndifferently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist\notherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian\nor Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean\nhumanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences\nresulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as\nhere remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities\nof vanities and to all that is vanity.",
        "And the problem of possible redemption?",
        "The minor was proved by the major.",
        "Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?",
        "The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,\nyellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their\nmagnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the\nwaggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular\ncinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the\ninterdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous\ndiscoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,\nGalle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of\ndistances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite\ncompressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and\nreentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of\nmeteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth\nof the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers\nabout the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, lo August): the\nmonthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms:\nthe posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a\nstar (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day\n(a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in\nincandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of\nWilliam Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting\nconstellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar\norigin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared\nfrom the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of\nthe birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar\norigin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared\nfrom the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of\nStephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years\nafter the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other\nconstellations some years before or after the birth or death of other\npersons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from\nimmersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity\nof winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals,\npersistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of\nhuman beings.",
        "His (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing\nfor possible error?",
        "That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a\nheavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the\nknown to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the\nsuppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of\ndifferent magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space,\nremobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a\npresent before its probable spectators had entered actual present\nexistence.",
        "Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?",
        "Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the\ndelirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection\ninvoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the\nsatellite of their planet.",
        "Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological\ninfluences upon sublunary disasters?",
        "It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the\nnomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to\nverifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the\nsea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.",
        "What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and\nwoman?",
        "Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian\ngenerations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her\nluminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and\nsetting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced\ninvariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative\ninterrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power\nto enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to\nincite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage:\nthe terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent\npropinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her\nlight, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her\narid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when\ninvisible.",
        "What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s,\ngaze?",
        "In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a\nparaffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller\nblind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving\nshutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.",
        "How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his\nwife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?",
        "With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued\naffection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with\nsuggestion.",
        "Both then were silent?",
        "Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal\nflesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.",
        "Were they indefinitely inactive?",
        "At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen, then\nBloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of\nmicturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition,\ntheir gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to the projected\nluminous and semiluminous shadow.",
        "Similarly?",
        "The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations\nwere dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of\nthe bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year\nat High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest\naltitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210\nscholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of\nthe previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent\nvesical pressure.",
        "What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the\ninvisible audible collateral organ of the other?",
        "To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity,\ndimension, sanitariness, pilosity.",
        "To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised\n(I January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from\nunnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine\nprepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic\nchurch, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of\nthe fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine\nexcrescences as hair and toenails.",

        "A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament\nfrom Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress\nof Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.",
        "How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal\ndeparter?",
        "By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an\nunstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and\nturning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple,\npulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing\nan aperture for free egress and free ingress.",
        "How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?",
        "Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its\nbase, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and\nforming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.",
        "What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their\n(respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?",
        "The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells\nin the church of Saint George.",

        "What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?",
        "The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the\napparition of a new solar disk.",
        "Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?",
        "Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of\nLuke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the\ndiurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of\nMizrach, the east.",
        "He remembered the initial paraphenomena?",
        "More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at\nvarious points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the\nvisible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first\ngolden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.",
        "Did he remain?",
        "With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering\nthe passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the\ncandle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room,\nhallfloor, and reentered.",
        "What suddenly arrested his ingress?",
        "The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into\ncontact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible\nfraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in\nconsequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.",

        "The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.",
        "For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?",
        "It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic\nrelation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil\nrecollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for\nthe night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and\nrenovated vitality.",
        "His justifications?",
        "As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life\nat least 2/7, viz. 20 years are passed in sleep. As a philosopher he knew\nthat at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part\nof any person’s desires has been realised. As a physiologist he believed\nin the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative\nduring somnolence.",

        "Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?",
        "Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain\nbeliefs and practices.",
        "As?",

Leopold\nBloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation\nof a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the\nestablishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres\nmentioned.",
        "Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these\nmigrations in narrator and listener?",
        "In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of\nnarcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of\nthe action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.",
        "What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?",
        "Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.\nOccasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an\ninclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food\nby means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.",

Nadir of\nmisery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic\npauper.",
        "With which attendant indignities?",
        "The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the\ncontempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the\nsimulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of\nillegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of\ndecomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less\nthan nothing.",
        "By what could such a situation be precluded?",
        "By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).",
        "Which preferably?",
        "The latter, by the line of least resistance.",
        "What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?",
        "Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The\nhabit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity to\ncounteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.",
        "What considerations rendered departure not irrational?",
        "The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being\ndone, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not\ndisunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which\nwas absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties,\nwhich was impossible.",
        "What considerations rendered departure desirable?",

        "Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?",
        "Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary\norbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets,\nastronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing\nfrom land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere imperceptibly he\nwould hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of\nrecall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown\nhe would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of\nCassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an\nestranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader,\na sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing\nthose of Rothschild or the silver king.",
        "What would render such return irrational?",
        "An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through\nreversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible\ntime.",
        "What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?",
        "The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the\nnight, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering\nperilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of\nan occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human)\ntempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable:\nthe statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire.",
        "What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an\nunoccupied bed?",
        "The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature\nfemale) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of\nmatutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the\ncase of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the\nspring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).",
        "What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of\naccumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?",

C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).",
        "What impersonal objects were perceived?",

        "Bloom’s acts?",
        "He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining\narticles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the\nbed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the\nproper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the\nfoot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.",
        "How?",
        "With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not\nhis own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being\nold, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under\nstress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or\nadders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception\nand of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of\nsleep and of death.",
        "What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?",
        "New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,\nfemale, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,\nsome flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.",
        "If he had smiled why would he have smiled?",
        "To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to\nenter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if\nthe first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,\nlast, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor\nalone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.",

        "What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and\nlate occupant of the bed?",
        "Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a\nbillsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a\nboaster).",
        "Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal\nproportion and commercial ability?",
        "Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding\nmembers of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably\ntransmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire,\nfinally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension\nand apprehension.",
        "With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections\naffected?",
        "Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.",
        "Envy?",
        "Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the\nsuperincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston\nand cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a\nconstant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental\nfemale organism, passive but not obtuse.",
        "Jealousy?",
        "Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the\nagent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between agent(s) and\nreagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase\nand decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.\nBecause the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction\nproduced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.",
        "Abnegation?",
        "In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the\nestablishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden\nQuay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and\nreappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of\nambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)\nextraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative,\ne) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net\nproceeds divided.",
        "Equanimity?",
        "As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or\nunderstood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance\nwith his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not\nso calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence\nof a collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway\nrobbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false\npretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money,\nbetrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors,\ncriminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony,\nmutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of\nunnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury,\npoaching, usury, intelligence with the king’s enemies, impersonation,\ncriminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not\nmore abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered\nconditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between\nthe bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages,\nacquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than\ninevitable, irreparable.",
        "Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?",
        "From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but\noutrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially\nviolated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the\nadulterously violated.",

        "In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and\nreflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?",
        "Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial\nhemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored\n(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of\nGreece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female\nhemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and\nseminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,\ninsusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,\nexpressive of mute immutable mature animality.",

        "Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his\nbreakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the CITY ARMS hotel when he\nused to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness\nto make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he\nthought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for\nmasses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid\nto lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she\nhad too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end\nof the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the\nwomen were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody\nwanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look\nat her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to\ncover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby\ntalk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to\nget shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up\nunder my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to\nold women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of\nnothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter\nwith him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything\nis clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and\nthen wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying\nthere till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has\nshes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when\ntheyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think\nit was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he\nsprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I\nwore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she\ncould find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans\nbedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on\naccount of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a\nman with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I\nhate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his\ncorns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then\nwed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all\nthe trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway\nlove its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one\nof those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel\nstory he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who\ndid I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me\nsee that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a\nyoung girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked\nout looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up\nto me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all\nthe big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate\nhaving a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little\nbitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they\nonly knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was\nscribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him\nDignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up\nwith the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very\nprobably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him\nbecause all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to\nforty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool\nlike an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not\nthat I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way\nthough Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under\nmy nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace\npadding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of\nthose painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting\nhim to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that\none when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman\nis not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants\nthen proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you\nplease O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the\noysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common\nrobbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it\ntakes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was\nher proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I\nthought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt\nlower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday\nshe was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled\nup on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that\nbetter do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only\nfor the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow\neither she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought\nhe was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up\nto my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew\nshe was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that\nlong so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom\nwhen was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by\nthe Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his\nlike that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes\nbeaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool\nhe said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give\nhim the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to\nbe always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some\nnicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like\nme Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my\ngarters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I\nknow what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging\ndrawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this\nthat and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because\nI told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews\ntemples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to\nDublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me\nout with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in\nyour mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name\nwho tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him\ncan you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought\nto give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman\nand no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then\nfinish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done\nnow once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make\nits only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think\nno more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him\nfirst you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all\nover you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me\nsometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a\nkiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that\nconfession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and\nwhat harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but\nwhereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes\nrather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom\nright out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did\nyou whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the\nreal father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to\nGod he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling\nit neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder\ndid he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of\ncourse hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father\ndied theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries\nlet alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the\nsmell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a\npriest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something\nto H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing\nI didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall\nthough I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking\nof his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it\nwho gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink\nnot whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their\nbills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and\nyellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera\nhats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had\nthe squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep\nhimself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port\nand potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and\ntired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped\nstraight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I\nthought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed\nmyself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as\nif the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres\nno God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only\nmake an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars\nstreet chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed\nscoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says\nyour soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know\nwhat it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come\n3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I\nthought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst\nthough his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the\nblinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like\niron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have\neaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I\nnever in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you\nfeel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making\nus like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion\ndriving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that\ndetermined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he\nhasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out\nand do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any\nof it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me\nnice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if\nsomeone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through\nwith Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys\nhusband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child\nor twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of\nchildren off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger\nwith a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I\nwas there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you\ncouldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they\nhave us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked\nhaving another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed\nhave a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes\nthatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the\nfuneral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think\nwhat he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a\nbit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the\nnight of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down\nmy neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was\nwhy we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said\nabout Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman\nis so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for\ngiving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he\nsaid He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still\nhe knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside\nI often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that\nfamily physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was\ncrowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her\nover him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he\nasked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the\npresent of Byron’s poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished\nthat I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id\neven supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her\nsomewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways\nask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil\nand gloves on going out I kiss then would send them all spinning however\nalright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too\ndelighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much\nmind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in\nthe eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a\ndeclaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me\nthough I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him\nfor that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he\nwas on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling\nthe potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him\noff letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty\nflour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams\nso I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be\nalways embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course\nglauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible\nasking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to\nthat putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking\na bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the\nkind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very\nhandsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked\nthough he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got\nengaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits\nof laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling\nout one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great\nhumour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant\nbecause I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all\nbut just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt\ndarken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like\nnow after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face\nbeginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must\nhave been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was\nedging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to\nrun him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go\nto bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine\nhaving to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any\nmoment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow\nwhatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or\nshine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat\nwhen he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his\nslippers to look for 10000 pounds for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May\nwouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually\ntoo stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man\nlike that Id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of\ncourse hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I\ndo know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of\nhis heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I\nwonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she\nthe downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men\ncan be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in\nthe world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all\nthat comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she\nput in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I\nasked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before\nshe must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance\nof being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do\nbesides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they",
        "theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he\nnoticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C\nwith Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both\nordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two\nold maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what\ndo I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he\nmade me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself\nalways with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I\nforgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some\nrobber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in\nthe ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom\nand I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was\nlooking when I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days after in the\nhope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them\nwhen we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too\ntight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the\nstone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold\nbracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my\nfoot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it\nwas well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black\nout when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in\nLombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to\nwalk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural\nlike the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give 9 points\nin 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I\nforget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man\nwith the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his\nface before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I\ntook my time Bartell dArcy too that he used to make fun of when he\ncommenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods AVE MARIA\nwhat are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part\nwhich is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my\nlow notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the\nway he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that\nthere in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill\ntell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him\nthere and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like\nit or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt\nan idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got\nme so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to\ngive him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along\nKenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take\nit off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my\nbedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw\nhim slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers\nthats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the\nbicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and\nI were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin\nstanding right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when\nhe saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me\nhowever standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new\nraincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his\ncomplexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing\nthere where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from\nanything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but\nthey want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him\ncoming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping\naway from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I\nhalfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my\nglove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for\nthe rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers\nthe whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll\nto carry about in his waistcoat pocket O MARIA SANTISIMA he did look a\nbig fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry\nto look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on\nwith the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in\nthe wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat\nyou never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for\nit if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers\noutside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him\nfrom doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he\ncircumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do\neverything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting\nall the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the\nbutchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that\nletter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman\nafter his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking\nme have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he\nhad a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always\nbreaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and\nif I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont\nunderstand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to\nbe written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with\nthat word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young\nthen writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way\nhe made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8\nbig poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my\nheart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel\nlike nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner\nI hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people\nwho come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then\nits somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy\nkitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the\nconcert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed\nwith boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright\nyes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more\nrespectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind\nlike the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending\nthe port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with\nnerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his\ntattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was l/4\nafter 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know\nthe time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to\nget it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for\nEngland home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I\nlove and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing\nthen this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to\nEnnis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did\nsuppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling\nwent on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with\nhim in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough\nknocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do\nsomething its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me\ntelling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its\nbetter hes going where he is besides something always happens with him\nthe time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup\nfor the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with\nthe soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and\nthe waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion\nfor the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two\ngentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too\nhes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job\nhe was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken\nus on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love\njaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he\ntake a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping\nthe guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at\nus with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an\nexceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage\nthat day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him l or 2\ntunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer\nthen coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped\nwith him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where\nits over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits\nof missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account\nof father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and\nwearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy\nnot Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past\nhim like he got me on to sing in the STABAT MATER by going around saying\nhe was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the\njesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on\ncopied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them\nSinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual\ntrash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck\nis very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it\nthats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a\nboycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria\nand Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd\nEast Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just\nthe right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely\nthe evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was\npale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he\ncouldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made\ntheir peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other\nold Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for\nyears killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was\neven decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment\npass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it\nwas lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of\nthe rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black\nWatch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the\nprince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the\nDublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses\nfor the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after\nwhat I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono\nthings I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with\nthem it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those\nthings in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning\nand turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round\nthe town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were\nmarried O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care\nhe has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get\nit out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit\nwashy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror\nnever gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that\nall the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for\nthis heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into\nme from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like\nthe dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he\nso quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the\nway it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish\ntie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly well off\nI know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a\nperfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress\ntearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he\nsaid he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on\naccount of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he\nwas making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long\njoult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me\nwith his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at\ndessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have\npicked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and\nbrowned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything\non my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish\nI had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was\nplaying with them then always hanging out of them for money in a\nrestaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful\nfor our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the\nway the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at\nleast two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind\nof drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the\ngirls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that\nAndalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she\nhadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one\ndays wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and\nkicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself\nand run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one\nof those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman\nwith elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good\nwhat did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that\nunsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly\nis a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I\ngetting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a\npancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel\nhe sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm\noff as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for\nfear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I\nwonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so\nmuch the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore\ntoday thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no\nthere was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my\nskin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same\nplace and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said\nto him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to\nwash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax\nand violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the\nskin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger\nafter the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry\nhandkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world without\nstyle all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell\nyou in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot\nmeasuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like\nthose new shoes yes how much were they Ive no clothes at all the brown\ncostume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that\nfor any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men\nwont look

in\nSeptember will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older\nthan me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she\nwas a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist\ntossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I\ndid every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it\nand was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and\nthat Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I\nsuppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a\nking theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a\nbeauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous\nold husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her\nwear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had\nthe oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books\nhe brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a\npriest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a\nnice word for any priest to write and her a–e as if any fool wouldnt\nknow what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old\nblackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and\nFair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 50\nthe part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord\nflagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up\nabout he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was\nover like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed\nVirgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her\nand I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to\nthe chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt\nhonoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found\nlilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in\nhis time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I\nwouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry\nfew shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something\nwhere hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a\nthrone to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering\nabout the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme\ntoday I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man\nor pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have\nbeen in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and\npatch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave\nme a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief\nreally and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old\nrubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it\nbut theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I\nknew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd\nand Bums as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage\nsale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing\nkills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans\ndress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into\nit if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me\nyes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles\noff my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my\nbackside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton\nstreet I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever\nshe could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much\ntrouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully\nstiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy\npigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at\nmy chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to\nshow me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without\nmaking it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being\nsupposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that\nway at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were",

of the word a hairpin\nto open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in\nthe face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her\nappearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles\nwith all her religion domineering because she never could get over the\nAtlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack\nflying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took\nall the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in\nSanta Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was\na marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed\nvirgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter Sunday\nmorning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the\nvatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he\nsigned it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw\nhim following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped\nme just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I\nhad it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and\ncorner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the\nhandwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a\nwhite rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time\nhe was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when\na boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue\nin my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few\ntimes to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to\nthe son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he\nbelieved me that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a\ntrue word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I\ntold him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls\nhe didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he\ncrushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the\npesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he\nsaid on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left\nMay yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like\nthat in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under\nthe rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and\nall about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail\ncareering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a\nregular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and\nthrow stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that\nwhite blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could\nwithout too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was\ntired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the\nhighest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful\nrocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them\nhanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the\nway down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships\nout far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the\nsky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them\noutside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over\nhim with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left\nside of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind\nof shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with\nhis for a moment but I wouldnt lee him he was awfully put out first for\nfear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that\nold servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all\nafter I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get\nlost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a\nwoman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad\nto get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far\nenough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes\nbecause theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did\nwe finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief\npretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch\nme inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I\ntormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog\nin the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below\nus he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush\na little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his\nout and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons\nmen down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me\nwhat was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant\nhe was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to\nthe whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said\nhed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed\ndo it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now\nflying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20\nyears if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his\nhands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still\nabout 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite\nchanged they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little\nknows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in\nbroad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they\ncould have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild\nafter when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros\nand exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming\ncoming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old\nguardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on\nthem I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what\nto make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often\nas I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop\nthat spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions\nabout girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new\nwoman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre\ncalled after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used\nto write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or\npractising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming\nJosie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or\nBriggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom\nor some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or\nsuppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have\ngiven me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita\nLaredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting\nin and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and\ndancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up\nthe stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper\ntrees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at\nhim he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make\nto the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze\nor two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up\nsomewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with\ncaptain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed\nhave one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris\nand the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco\nalmost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it\nand the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking\nof him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to\nslip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under\nmy pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in\nthat Gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and left a stink\non you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me\nthat clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south\nAfrica where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they\nwere well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like\nan opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold

wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking\nbut I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring\nlike that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as\nI wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh place I bought I think\nIll get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some\nblancmange with black

trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all\nthe people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black\nand blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I\ndont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms\nhotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt\nwanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love\nlost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book he\nbrought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock\nI suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube\nfrom one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all\nruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy\nand tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea\nexcited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the\nback of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old\nLuigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with\nthe earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I\nsuppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being\nalone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put\nup with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the\nconfusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor\ndrawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and\nruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the\nthings he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him\ntelling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by\nmoonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out\nof some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I\nliked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man\nwill you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim\nfor all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know\nwhat old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a\ntramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that\npicture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20\nyears in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money\nimagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run\nmiles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and\nwindows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison\nor a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big\nbrute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her\nbed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better\nthan nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he\nwent down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for\na mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much\nnoise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to\nsteal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with\nMilly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to\ntake photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to\nSkerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all IS at\nschool only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and\nBoylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans\neverything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I\nbolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking\nfirst when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself\nthere below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all\nday put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew\nshe broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness\nand carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to\nmend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the\npotatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he\nwas always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the\npaper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his\nside of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a\nmatter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything\nwrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished\nout and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see\nwell see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons\nimitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her\ncan Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out\nof her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as\nwell he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting\nto go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose\nI smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I\nsewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell\nyou only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting\nand the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter\nwhat they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is\nopen too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I\nhad to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the\nwindowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me\nwhen I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great\ntouchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take\nyour foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life\nId crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in\ntheatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to\nyou that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the\nlast time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or\nher barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit\ndaft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies\noutside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the\nmoment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt\neven want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell\nget someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down\nwith the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of\ncourse she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was\nwhat 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls\nnonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on\nblack paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain\ncame down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for\nbreakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be\nreal love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I\nsuppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it\nthough unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a\nparticle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays\nfull up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre\nusually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer\nto go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt\nlost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have\nwanting to put her hair up at I S my powder too only ruin her skin on her\nshes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless\nknowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I\nwas too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me\nlike a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the\nday we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not\nto see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough\ntill I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that\nnow for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me\nthat exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because\nhow was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before\ncheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave\nknives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she\nsaid herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last\ntime she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent\norder me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us\nslaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to\nhave a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to\nlet her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs\nFleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into\nher hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she\ncant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got\nlost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area\nwindow to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them\nlike the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have\nbeen mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with\nhis glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great\nbig hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got\nall those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine\nclimbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he\ndidnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature\ngave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen\nnow is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair\nof drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for\nall hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on\nthem he might think was something else and she never even rendered down\nthe fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her\nparalysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them\ndisease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its\ndrink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every\nday I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im\nstretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to\nget up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me\nyes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and\nploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday\nwouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do\nGod knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks\nusual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me\nlike that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave\nhim to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did\nabout insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt\ngive in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his\nglasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul\nthats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all\nin a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out\nthen to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry\nsupposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery\nhissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman\nin the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it\nI wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off\nthan us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its\npouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as\nhe is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the\nclean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want\nto see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats\ntroubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40\ntimes over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too\npurply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever\nsuggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and\nchildren this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they\ncould hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to\nput the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it\nnicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me\nthere scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great\nsuckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to\nsee his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its\nbreaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting\non his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off\nonly my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he\noughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those\nkissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out\nstraight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre\nbubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it\nin the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs\nthan that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there\nbetween this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being\na man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like\nthe jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore",
        "who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I\nsomething growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was\nit last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the\ndoctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white\nthing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr\nCollins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I\nsuppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round\nthose rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little\nfiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so\ntheyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the\nworld besides theres something queer about their children always smelling\naround those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an\noffensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe\nwhat a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him\nwith all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it\neasily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the\nway he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like\nletting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull\nthe chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres\nsomething in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a\nchild whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that\nhow much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent\nomissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have\nomissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt\ntrust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I\nliked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his\nnose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no\nmatter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course\nthat was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one\neverything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that\ncomes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got\nout of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5\ntimes a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am\nquite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only\nnatural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night\never we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one\nanother for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account\nof my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things\nhe said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he\nwas going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to\nbelieve all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me\nthat long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be\nmore classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once\nexplaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you\nenjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st\nopportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom\npretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk\nand sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I\nlaughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting\non this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman\ncould sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in\nall creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes\nsleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its\nwell he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his\nhand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday\nin the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his\nside on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger\nreligion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia\nimitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to\nsleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes\nmouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah\nyes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes\nsleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him\ngreat value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this\nnuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the\nother world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight\nnow the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he\nscratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from\nLord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told\nhim easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16\nyears how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario\nterrace and Lombard street and Holles

or he goes and\ngives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the\nFreeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the\nfreemasons then well see if the little man he

trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges\nchurch bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well thats a nice\nhour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down\ninto the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit\ntomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that\nFrench letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know\ndeceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why\nshould we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then\ntucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he\nbrought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life\nwithout some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more\nwith those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the\nkind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in\ntheir empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea\nand

floor half\nthe night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them\nand wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I\nthought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong\ntoo thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont\nknow what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he\ndoesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the\nblackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes\nsuch a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman\nthats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him\nthat forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some\nlittle bitch hes got in with even when I

up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of\ncourse and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy\nDignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper\nBoylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something\nreversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom\nand Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly

to get my husband again into\ntheir clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I\nknow well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough\nnot to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks\nafter his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same\nIm sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do\nunless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub\ncorner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home\nher widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming\nthough if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree\ndinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the\nswallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into\nthem and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs\nbotty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a\nspectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for that\nto see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was\nalways turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old\nlove is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn\nbough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him\nat Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe\ndearest goodbye sweetheart SWEETheart he always sang it not like Bartell\nDarcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there\nwas no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood\nflower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register\neven transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then\nhed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I\nwonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a\nuniversity professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving\nat now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it\ntaken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it\nI wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after\nall why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his\nfather and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11\nthough what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one\nthing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the\ndeathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into\nmourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an\ninnocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit\nand curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons\nhe liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on\nhe was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a\nyoung stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant\nhim but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned\nthe other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a\njourney by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3\nqueens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came\nout and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream\nsomething too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt\nlong greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian\nwhat do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their\npoetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought\nhe was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I\nthought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88\nI was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons\n5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23\nor 24 I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he\nwouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa\nand talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told\nhim he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope\nhes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John\nJameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he\nwont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where\npoetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully\ncoming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point\nthe guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there\nagain all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him\ntheyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as\nloves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a\nchange the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about\nyourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad\nand Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we\nhave to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like\nthat God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I\ncould see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock\nstanding up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging\ninto the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some\nconsolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could\nlook at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for\nyou to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted\nto kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt\nmind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you\nto suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too\nin 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or\nthe dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs\nof men I suppose never dream of washing it from I years end to the other\nthe most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure\nitll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age\nIll throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard\ncomes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill\nread and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who\nhe likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same\nand I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he\nhalf faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly\ntoo with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but\nthen what am I going to do about him though",
        "no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no\nnothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I\ndidnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage\nthats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off\nhis shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without\neven asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a\nshirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old\nhypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his\nway to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what\nwith a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an\nold Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and\ntempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself\nsometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a\nwomans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one\nmyself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on\nyou so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John\nhas a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of\nMarrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and\nthey knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either\nits only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy\netcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men\nagain all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman\nor a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses\nround behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not\ngoing to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their\nstupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead\nof quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well\nnaturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he\ndoes and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair\nTyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband\nor wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we\ngiven all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young\nstill can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time\nliving with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes\nasleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd\nkiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything\nunnatural where we havent I atom of any kind of expression in us all of\nus the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the\ndirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita\ntheres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a\nmadman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a\nwoman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young\nno matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the\nfellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would\nI go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me\nand pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a\npin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those\nwildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the\nBloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent\nmine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over\nand over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with\nthe fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up\nagainst the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do\nthemselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up\nsomewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the\nfish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was\nfor me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I\nturned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming\nout of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after\nthat only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with\ndisease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike\nlisten to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep\nand sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came\nout on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man\nin some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he does\nthat I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get\nhis lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed\ndid you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them\nattention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd\nbe much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you\nwouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do\nyou ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every\npenny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she\ndoes she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all\nonly for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how\ncould they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to\nlook after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now\nout at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on\naccount of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those\nthat have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not\nable to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching\nthe two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that\ndisheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that\nlittle woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor\nchild but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we\nwere never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms\nabout that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the\ntime it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the\ncity meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother\nwouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still\nits a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the\nair of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he\nwants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you\nI hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a\ndreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us\nso snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa\nin the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young\nhardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah\nwhat harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz\nDelagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of\nSanta Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las\nSiete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a\nname Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O\nmy and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers\nramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me\nif I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a\nday older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the\nSpanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten\nit all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any\nperson place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous\nMrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the\ntwo ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish\nand he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity\nhe didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good\nsleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit\nof toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the\nwoman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and\ntasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could\nbear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all\nright since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me\nall the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very\nfunny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half\nawake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord\nthe cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing\nhe stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed\nin the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in\nthere for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed\nin the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for I he can make it\nfor 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if\nhe takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with\nan intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red\nslippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice\nsemitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing\njacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give\nhim one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old\nbed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables\nand cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits\nall coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet\ntheyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are\nand the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to\nmelt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill\nthrow him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make\nhis mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do\nIll go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa\npieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non

yes and damn well fucked too up to\nmy neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his\nspunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought\nto satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him\nstand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and\nmake him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault\nif I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if\nthats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not\nmuch doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is\nsupposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so\nattractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my\ndrawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick\nhis tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell\nhim I want LI or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes\nthen if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it\nall out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine\ncheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few\ntimes he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it\noff on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose\nthat cant be helped Ill do the indifferent l or 2 questions Ill know by\nthe answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every\nturn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words\nsmellrump or

love to have the whole place swimming in\nroses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then\nthe sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields\nof oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going\nabout that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers\nall sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the\nditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no\nGod I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why\ndont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever\nthey call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then\nthey go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre\nafraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well\nwho was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that\nmade it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they\nmight as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for\nyou he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head\nin the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to\nme yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was\nleapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near\nlost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are\nflowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life\nand the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I\nsaw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get\nround him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he\nasked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the\nsea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey\nand Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the\nsailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they\ncalled it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with\nthe thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish\ngirls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in\nthe morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who\nelse from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all\nclucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep\nand the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and\nthe big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of\nyears old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like\nkings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with\nthe old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her\nlover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the\ncastanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman\ngoing about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and\nthe sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and\nthe figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets\nand the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the\njessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was\na Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the\nAndalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me\nunder the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then\nI asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I\nyes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes\nand drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and\nhis heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.",
