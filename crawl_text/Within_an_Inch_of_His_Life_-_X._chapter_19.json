        "The prison of Sauveterre is in the castle at the upper end of town, in\na poor and almost deserted suburb. This castle, once upon a time of\ngreat importance, had been dismantled at the time of the siege of\nRochelle; and all that remains are a few badly-repaired ruins,\nramparts with fosses that have been filled up, a gate surmounted by a\nsmall belfry, a chapel converted into a magazine, and finally two huge\ntowers connected by an immense building, the lower rooms in which are\nvaulted.",
        "Nothing can be more mournful than these ruins, enclosed within an ivy-\ncovered wall; and nothing would indicate the use that is made of them,\nexcept the sentinel which stands day and night at the gate. Ancient\nelm-trees overshadow the vast courts; and on the old walls, as well as\nin every crevice, there grow and bloom enough flowers to rejoice a\nhundred prisoners. But this romantic prison is without prisoners.",
        "“It is a cage without birds,” says the jailer often in his most\nmelancholy voice.",
        "He takes advantage of this to raise his vegetables all along the\nslopes; and the exposure is so excellent, that he is always the first\nin Sauveterre who had young peas. He has also taken advantage of this\n–with leave granted by the authorities–to fit up very comfortable\nlodgings for himself in one of the towers. He has two rooms below, and\na chamber up stairs, which you reach by a narrow staircase in the\nthickness of the wall. It was to this chamber that the keeper’s wife\ntook Dionysia with all the promptness of fear. The poor girl was out\nof breath. Her heart was beating violently; and, as soon as she was in\nthe room, she sank into a chair.",
        "“Great God!” cried the woman. “You are not sick, my dear young lady?\nWait, I’ll run for some vinegar.”",
        "“Never mind,” replied Dionysia in a feeble voice. “Stay here, my dear\nColette: don’t go away!”",
        "For Colette was her name, though she was as dark as gingerbread,\nnearly forty-five years old, and boasted of a decided mustache on her\nupper lip.",
        "“Poor young lady!” she said. “You feel badly at being here.”",
        "“Yes,” replied Dionysia. “But where is your husband?”",
        "“Down stairs, on the lookout, madam. He will come up directly.” Very\nsoon afterwards, a heavy step was heard on the stairs; and Blangin\ncame in, looking pale and anxious, like a man who feels that he is\nrunning a great risk.",
        "“Neither seen nor known,” he cried. “No one is aware of your presence\nhere. I was only afraid of that dog of a sentinel; and, just as you\ncame by, I had managed to get him round the corner, offering him a\ndrop of something to drink. I begin to hope I shall not lose my\nplace.”",
        "Dionysia accepted these words as a summons to speak out.",
        "“Ah!” she said, “don’t mind your place: don’t you know I have promised\nyou a better one?”",
        "And, with a gayety which was very far from being real, she opened her\nlittle bag, and put upon the table the rolls which it contained.",
        "“Ah, that is gold!” said Blangin with eager eyes.",
        "“Yes. Each one of these rolls contains a thousand francs; and here are\nsixteen.”",
        "An irresistible temptation seized the jailer.",
        "“May I see?” he asked.",
        "“Certainly!” replied the young girl. “Look for yourself and count.”",
        "She was mistaken. Blangin did not think of counting, not he. What he\nwanted was only to gratify his eye by the sight of the gold, to hear\nits sound, to handle it.",
        "With feverish eagerness he tore open the wrappings, and let the pieces\nfall in cascades upon the table; and, as the heap increased, his lips\nturned white, and perspiration broke out on his temples.",
        "“And all that is for me?” he said with a stupid laugh.",
        "“Yes, it is yours,” replied Dionysia.",
        "“I did not know how sixteen thousand francs would look. How beautiful\ngold is! Just look, wife.”",
        "But Colette turned her head away. She was quite as covetous as her\nhusband, and perhaps even more excited; but she was a woman, and she\nknew how to dissemble.",
        "“Ah, my dear young lady!” she said, “never would my old man and myself\nhave asked you for money, if we had only ourselves to think of. But we\nhave children.”",
        "“Your duty is to think of your children,” replied Dionysia.",
        "“I know sixteen thousand francs is a big sum. Perhaps you will be\nsorry to give us so much money.”",
        "“I am not sorry at all: I would even add to it willingly.” And she\nshowed them one of the other four rolls in her bag.",
        "“Then, to be sure, what do I care for my place!” cried Blangin. And,\nintoxicated by the sight and the touch of the gold, he added,–",
        "“You are at home here, madam; and the jail and the jailer are at your\ndisposal. What do you desire? Just speak. I have nine prisoners, not\ncounting M. de Boiscoran and Trumence. Do you want me to set them all\nfree?”",
        "“Blangin!” said his wife reprovingly.",
        "“What? Am I not free to let the prisoners go?”",
        "“Before you play the master, wait, at least, till you have rendered\nour young lady the service which she expects from you.”",
        "“Certainly.”",
        "“Then go and conceal this money,” said the prudent woman; “or it might\nbetray us.”",
        "And, drawing from her cupboard a woollen stocking, she handed it to\nher husband, who slipped the sixteen thousand francs into it,\nretaining about a dozen gold-pieces, which he kept in his pocket so as\nalways to have in his hands some tangible evidence of his new fortune.\nWhen this was done, and the stocking, full to overflowing, had been\nput back in the cupboard under a pile of linen, she ordered her\nhusband,–",
        "“Now, you go down. Somebody might be coming; and, if you were not\nthere to open when they knock, that might look suspicious.”",
        "Like a well-trained husband, Blangin obeyed without saying a word; and\nthen his wife bethought herself how to entertain Dionysia. She hoped,\nshe said, her dear young lady would do her the honor to take\nsomething. That would strengthen her, and, besides, help her to pass\nthe time; for it was only seven o’clock, and Blangin could not take\nher to M. de Boiscoran’s cell before ten, without great danger.",
        "“But I have dined,” Dionysia objected. “I do not want any thing.”",
        "The woman insisted only the more. She remembered (God be thanked!) her\ndear young lady’s taste; and she had made her an admirable broth, and\nsome beautiful dessert. And, while thus talking, she set the table,\nhaving made up her mind that Dionysia must eat at all hazards; at\nleast, so says the tradition of the place.",
        "The eager zeal of the woman had, at least, this advantage,–that it\nprevented Dionysia from giving way to her painful thoughts.",
        "Night had come. It was nine o’clock; then it struck ten. At last, the\nwatch came round to relieve the sentinels. A quarter of an hour after\nthat, Blangin reappeared, holding a lantern and an enormous bunch of\nkeys in his hands.",
        "“I have seen Trumence to bed,” he said. “You can come now, madam.”",
        "Dionysia was all ready.",
        "“Let us go,” she said simply.",
        "Then she followed the jailer along interminable passages, through a\nvast vaulted hall, in which their steps resounded as in a church, then\nthrough a long gallery. At last, pointing at a massive door, through\nthe cracks of which the light was piercing, he said,–",
        "“Here we are.”",
        "But Dionysia seized his arm, and said in an almost inaudible voice,–",
        "“Wait a moment.”",
        "She was almost overcome by so many successive emotions. She felt her\nlegs give way under her, and her eyes become dim. In her heart she\npreserved all her usual energy; but the flesh escaped from her will\nand failed her at the last moment.",
        "“Are you sick?” asked the jailer. “What is the matter?”",
        "She prayed to God for courage and strength: when her prayer was\nfinished, she said,–",
        "“Now, let us go in.”",
        "And, making a great noise with the keys and the bolts, Blangin opened\nthe door to Jacques de Boiscoran’s cell.",
        "Jacques counted no longer the days, but the hours. He had been\nimprisoned on Friday morning, June 23, and this was Wednesday night,\nJune 28, He had been a hundred and thirty-two hours, according to the\ngraphic description of a great writer, “living, but struck from the\nroll of the living, and buried alive.”",
        "Each one of these hundred and thirty-two hours had weighed upon him\nlike a month. Seeing him pale and haggard, with his hair and beard in\ndisorder, and his eyes shining brightly with fever, like half-\nextinguished coals, one would hardly have recognized in him the happy\nlord of Boiscoran, free from care and trouble, upon whom fortune had\never smiled,–that haughty sceptical young man, who from the height of\nthe past defied the future.",
        "The fact is, that society, obliged to defend itself against criminals,\nhas invented no more fearful suffering than what is called “close\nconfinement.” There is nothing that will sooner demoralize a man,\ncrush his will, and utterly conquer the most powerful energy. There is\nno struggle more distressing than the struggle between an innocent man\naccused of some crime, and the magistrate,–a helpless being in the\nhands of a man armed with unlimited power.",
        "If great sorrow was not sacred, to a certain degree, Dionysia might\nhave heard all about Jacques. Nothing would have been easier. She\nwould have been told by Blangin, who was watching M. de Boiscoran like\na spy, and by his wife, who prepared his meals, through what anguish\nhe had passed since his imprisonment.",
        "Stunned at first, he had soon recovered; and on Friday and Saturday he\nhad been quiet and confident, talkative, and almost cheerful. But\nSunday had been a fatal day. Two gendarmes had carried him to\nBoiscoran to take off the seals; and on his way out he had been\noverwhelmed with insults and curses by the people who had recognized\nhim. He had come back terribly distressed.",
        "On Tuesday, he had received Dionysia’s letter, and answered it. This\nhad excited him fearfully, and, during a part of the night, Trumence\nhad seen him walk up and down in his cell with all the gestures and\nincoherent imprecations of a madman.",
        "He had hoped for a letter on Wednesday. When none came, he had sunk\ninto a kind of stupor, during which M. Galpin had been unable to draw\na word from him. He had taken nothing all day long but a little broth\nand a cup of coffee. When the magistrate left him, he had sat down,\nleaning his head on his elbows, facing the window; and there he had\nremained, never moving, and so deeply absorbed in his reveries, that\nhe had taken no notice when they brought him light. He was still in\nthis state, when, a little after ten o’clock, he heard the grating of\nthe bolts of his cell. He had become so well acquainted with the\nprison that he knew all its regulations. He knew at what hours his\nmeals were brought, at what time Trumence came to clean up his room,\nand when he might expect the magistrate. After night, he knew he was\nhis own master till next morning. So late a visit therefore, must\nneeds bring him some unexpected news, his liberty, perhaps,–that\nvisitor for whom all prisoners look so anxiously.",
        "He started up. As soon as he distinguished in the darkness the\njailer’s rugged face, he asked eagerly,–",
        "“Who wants me?”",
        "Blangin bowed. He was a polite jailer. Then he replied,–",
        "“Sir, I bring you a visitor.”",
        "And, moving aside, he made way for Dionysia, or, rather, he pushed her\ninto the room; for she seemed to have lost all power to move.",
        "“A visitor?” repeated M. de Boiscoran.",
        "But the jailer had raised his lantern, and the poor man could\nrecognize his betrothed.",
        "“You,” he cried, “you here!”",
        "And he drew back, afraid of being deceived by a dream, or one of those\nfearful hallucinations which announce the coming of insanity, and take\nhold of the brains of sick people in times of over-excitement.",
        "“Dionysia!” he barely whispered, “Dionysia!”",
        "If not her own life (for she cared nothing for that), but Jacques’s\nlife, had at that moment depended on a single word, Dionysia could not\nhave uttered it. Her throat was parched, and her lips refused to move.\nThe jailer took it upon himself to answer,–",
        "“Yes,” he said, “Miss Chandore.”",
        "“At this hour, in my prison!”",
        "“She had something important to communicate to you. She came to me\"–",
        "“O Dionysia!” stammered Jacques, “what a precious friend\"–",
        "“And I agreed,” said Blangin in a paternal tone of voice, “to bring\nher in secretly. It is a great sin I commit; and if it ever should\nbecome known– But one may be ever so much a jailer, one has a heart,\nafter all. I tell you so merely because the young lady might not think\nof it. If the secret is not kept carefully, I should lose my place,\nand I am a poor man, with wife and children.”",
        "“You are the best of men!” exclaimed M. de Boiscoran, far from\nsuspecting the price that had been paid for Blangin’s sympathy, “and,\non the day on which I regain my liberty, I will prove to you that we\nwhom you have obliged are not ungrateful.”",
        "“Quite at your service,” replied the jailer modestly.",
        "Gradually, however, Dionysia had recovered her self-possession. She\nsaid gently to Blangin,–",
        "“Leave us now, my good friend.”",
        "As soon as he had disappeared, and without allowing M. de Boiscoran to\nsay a word, she said, speaking very low,–",
        "“Jacques, grandpapa has told me, that by coming thus to you at night,\nalone, and in secret, I run the risk of losing your affection, and of\ndiminishing your respect.”",
        "“Ah, you did not think so!”",
        "“Grandpapa has more experience than I have, Jacques. Still I did not\nhesitate. Here I am; and I should have run much greater risks; for\nyour honor is at stake, and your honor is my honor, as your life is my\nlife. Your future is at stake, /our/ future, our happiness, all our\nhopes here below.”",
        "Inexpressible joy had illumined the prisoner’s face.",
        "“O God!” he cried, “one such moment pays for years of torture.”",
        "But Dionysia had sworn to herself, as she came, that nothing should\nturn her aside from her purpose. So she went on,–",
        "“By the sacred memory of my mother, I assure you, Jacques, that I have\nnever for a moment doubted your innocence.”",
        "The unhappy man looked distressed.",
        "“You,” he said; “but the others? But M. de Chandore?”",
        "“Do you think I would be here, if he thought you were guilty? My aunts\nand your mother are as sure of it as I am.”",
        "“And my father? You said nothing about him in your letter.”",
        "“Your father remained in Paris in case some influence in high quarters\nshould have to be appealed to.”",
        "Jacque shook his head, and said,–",
        "“I am in prison at Sauveterre, accused of a fearful crime, and my\nfather remains in Paris! It must be true that he never really loved\nme. And yet I have always been a good son to him down to this terrible\ncatastrophe. He has never had to complain of me. No, my father does\nnot love me.”",
        "Dionysia could not allow him to go off in this way.",
        "“Listen to me, Jacques,” she said: “let me tell you why I ran the risk\nof taking this serious step, that may cost me so dear. I come to you\nin the name of all your friends, in the name of M. Folgat, the great\nadvocate whom your mother has brought down from Paris and in the name\nof M. Magloire, in whom you put so much confidence. They all agree you\nhave adopted an abominable system. By refusing obstinately to speak,\nyou rush voluntarily into the gravest danger. Listen well to what I\ntell you. If you wait till the examination is over, you are lost. If\nyou are once handed over to the court, it is too late for you to\nspeak. You will only, innocent as you are, make one more on the list\nof judicial murders.”",
        "Jacques de Boiscoran had listened to Dionysia in silence, his head\nbowed to the ground, as if to conceal its pallor from her. As soon as\nshe stopped, all out of breath, he murmured,–",
        "“Alas! Every thing you tell me I have told myself more than once.”",
        "“And you did not speak?”",
        "“I did not.”",
        "“Ah, Jacques, you are not aware of the danger you run! You do not\nknow\"–",
        "“I know,” he said, interrupting her in a harsh, hoarse voice,–\"I know\nthat the scaffold, or the galleys, are at the end.”",
        "Dionysia was petrified with horror.",
        "Poor girl! She had imagined that she would only have to show herself\nto triumph over Jacques’s obstinacy, and that, as soon as she had\nheard what he had to say, she would feel reassured. And instead of\nthat–",
        "“What a misfortune!” she cried. “You have taken up these fearful\nnotions, and you will not abandon them!”",
        "“I must keep silent.”",
        "“You cannot. You have not considered!–”",
        "“Not considered,” he repeated.",
        "And in a lower tone he added,–",
        "“And what do you think I have been doing these hundred and thirty\nmortal hours since I have been alone in this prison,–alone to\nconfront a terrible accusation, and a still more terrible emergency?”",
        "“That is the difficulty, Jacques: you are the victim of your own\nimagination. And who could help it in your place? M. Folgat said so\nonly yesterday. There is no man living, who, after four days’ close\nconfinement, can keep his mind cool. Grief and solitude are bad\ncounsellors. Jacques, come to yourself; listen to your dearest friends\nwho speak to you through me. Jacques, your Dionysia beseeches you.\nSpeak!”",
        "“I cannot.”",
        "“Why not?”",
        "She waited for some seconds; and, as he did not reply, she said, not\nwithout a slight accent of bitterness in her voice,–",
        "“Is it not the first duty of an innocent man to establish his\ninnocence?”",
        "The prisoner, with a movement of despair, clasped his hands over his\nbrow. Then bending over Dionysia, so that she felt his breath in her\nhair, he said,–",
        "“And when he cannot, when he cannot, establish his innocence?”",
        "She drew back, pale unto death, tottering so that she had to lean\nagainst the wall, and cast upon Jacques de Boiscoran glances in which\nthe whole horror of her soul was clearly expressed.",
        "“What do you say?” she stammered. “O God!”",
        "He laughed, the wretched man! with that laugh which is the last\nutterance of despair. And then he replied,–",
        "“I say that there are circumstances which upset our reason; unheard-of\ncircumstances, which could make one doubt of one’s self. I say that\nevery thing accuses me, that every thing overwhelms me, that every\nthing turns against me. I say, that if I were in M. Galpin’s place,\nand if he were in mine, I should act just as he does.”",
        "“That is insanity!” cried Dionysia.",
        "But Jacques de Boiscoran did not hear her. All the bitterness of the\nlast days rose within him: he turned red, and became excited. At last,\nwith gasping vice, he broke forth,–",
        "“Establish my innocence! Ah! that is easily said. But how? No, I am\nnot guilty: but a crime has been committed; and for this crime justice\nwill have a culprit. If it is not I who fired at Count Claudieuse, and\nset Valpinson on fire, who is it? ’Where were you,’ they ask me, ’at\nthe time of the murder?’ Where was I? Can I tell it? To clear myself\nis to accuse others. And if I should be mistaken? Or if, not being\nmistaken, I should be unable to prove the truthfulness of my\naccusation? The murderer and the incendiary, of course, took all\npossible precautions to escape detection, and to let the punishment\nfall upon me. I was warned beforehand. Ah, if we could always foresee,\ncould know beforehand! How can I defend myself? On the first day I\nsaid, ’Such a charge cannot reach me: it is a cloud that a breath will\nscatter.’ Madman that I was! The cloud has become an avalanche, and I\nmay be crushed. I am neither a child nor a coward; and I have always\nmet phantoms face to face. I have measured the danger, and I know it\nis fearful.”",
        "Dionysia shuddered. She cried,–",
        "“What will become of us?”",
        "This time M. de Boiscoran heard her, and was ashamed of his weakness.\nBut, before he could master his feelings, the young girl went on,\nsaying,–",
        "“But never mind. These are idle thoughts. Truth soars invincible,\nunchangeable, high above all the ablest calculations and the most\nskilful combinations. Jacques, you must tell the truth, the whole\ntruth, without subterfuge or concealment.”",
        "“I can do so no longer,” murmured he.",
        "“Is it such a terrible secret?”",
        "“It is improbable.”",
        "Dionysia looked at him almost with fear. She did not recognize his old\nface, nor his eye, nor the tone of his voice. She drew nearer to him,\nand taking his hand between her own small white hands, she said,–",
        "“But you can tell it to me, your friend, your\"–",
        "He trembled, and, drawing back, he said,–",
        "“To you less than anybody else.”",
        "And, feeling how mortifying such an answer must be, he added,–",
        "“Your mind is too pure for such wretched intrigues. I do not want your\nwedding-dress to be stained by a speck of that mud into which they\nhave thrown me.”",
        "Was she deceived? No; but she had the courage to seem to be deceived.\nShe went on quietly,–",
        "“Very well, then. But the truth will have to be told sooner or later.”",
        "“Yes, to M. Magloire.”",
        "“Well, then, Jacques, write down at once what you mean to tell him.\nHere are pen and ink: I will carry it to him faithfully.”",
        "“There are things, Dionysia, which cannot be written.”",
        "She felt she was beaten; she understood that nothing would ever bend\nthat iron will, and yet she said once more,–",
        "“But if I were to beseech you, Jacques, by our past and our future, by\nthat great and eternal love which you have sworn?”",
        "“Do you really wish to make my prison hours a thousand times harder\nthan they are? Do you want to deprive me of my last remnant of\nstrength and of courage? Have you really no confidence in me any\nlonger? Could you not believe me a few days more?”",
        "He paused. Somebody knocked at the door; and almost at the same time\nBlangin the jailer called out through the wicket,–",
        "“Time is passing. I want to be down stairs when they relieve guard. I\nam running a great risk. I am a father of a family.”",
        "“Go home now, Dionysia,” said Jacques eagerly, “go home. I cannot\nthink of your being seen here.”",
        "Dionysia had paid dear enough to know that she was quite safe; still\nshe did not object. She offered her brow to Jacques, who touched it\nwith his lips; and half dead, holding on to the walls, she went back\nto the jailer’s little room. They had made up a bed for her, and she\nthrew herself on it, dressed as she was, and remained there,\nimmovable, as if she had been dead, overcome by a kind of stupor which\ndeprived her even of the faculty of suffering.",
        "It was bright daylight, it was eight o’clock, when she felt somebody\npulling her sleeve. The jailer’s wife said to her,–",
        "“My dear young lady, this would be a good time for you to slip away.\nPerhaps they will wonder to see you alone in the street; but they will\nthink you are coming home from seven o’clock mass.”",
        "Without saying a word, Dionysia jumped down, and in a moment she had\narranged her hair and her dress. Then Blangin came, rather troubled at\nnot seeing her leave the house; and she said to him, giving him one of\nthe thousand-franc rolls that were still in her bag,–",
        "“This is for you: I want you to remember me, if I should need you\nagain.”",
        "And, dropping her veil over her face, she went away.",
