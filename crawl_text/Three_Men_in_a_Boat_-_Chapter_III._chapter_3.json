        "ARRANGEMENTS SETTLED. – HARRIS’S METHOD OF DOING WORK. – HOW THE ELDERLY, \nFAMILY-MAN PUTS UP A PICTURE. – GEORGE MAKES A SENSIBLE, REMARK. – \nDELIGHTS OF EARLY MORNING BATHING. – PROVISIONS FOR GETTING UPSET.",
        "SO, on the following evening, we again assembled, to discuss and arrange \nour plans.  Harris said:",
        "“Now, the first thing to settle is what to take with us.  Now, you get a \nbit of paper and write down, J., and you get the grocery catalogue, \nGeorge, and somebody give me a bit of pencil, and then I’ll make out a \nlist.”",
        "That’s Harris all over – so ready to take the burden of everything \nhimself, and put it on the backs of other people.",
        "He always reminds me of my poor Uncle Podger.  You never saw such a \ncommotion up and down a house, in all your life, as when my Uncle Podger \nundertook to do a job.  A picture would have come home from the frame-\nmaker’s, and be standing in the dining-room, waiting to be put up; and \nAunt Podger would ask what was to be done with it, and Uncle Podger would \nsay:",
        "“Oh, you leave that to ME.  Don’t you, any of you, worry yourselves about \nthat.  I’LL do all that.”",
        "And then he would take off his coat, and begin.  He would send the girl \nout for sixpen’orth of nails, and then one of the boys after her to tell \nher what size to get; and, from that, he would gradually work down, and \nstart the whole house.",
        "“Now you go and get me my hammer, Will,” he would shout; “and you bring \nme the rule, Tom; and I shall want the step-ladder, and I had better have \na kitchen-chair, too; and, Jim! you run round to Mr. Goggles, and tell \nhim, `Pa’s kind regards, and hopes his leg’s better; and will he lend him \nhis spirit-level?’  And don’t you go, Maria, because I shall want \nsomebody to hold me the light; and when the girl comes back, she must go \nout again for a bit of picture-cord; and Tom! – where’s Tom? – Tom, you \ncome here; I shall want you to hand me up the picture.”",
        "And then he would lift up the picture, and drop it, and it would come out \nof the frame, and he would try to save the glass, and cut himself; and \nthen he would spring round the room, looking for his handkerchief.  He \ncould not find his handkerchief, because it was in the pocket of the coat \nhe had taken off, and he did not know where he had put the coat, and all \nthe house had to leave off looking for his tools, and start looking for \nhis coat; while he would dance round and hinder them.",
        "“Doesn’t anybody in the whole house know where my coat is?  I never came \nacross such a set in all my life – upon my word I didn’t.  Six of you! – \nand you can’t find a coat that I put down not five minutes ago!  Well, of \nall the – “",
        "Then he’d get up, and find that he had been sitting on it, and would call \nout:",
        "“Oh, you can give it up!  I’ve found it myself now.  Might just as well \nask the cat to find anything as expect you people to find it.”",
        "And, when half an hour had been spent in tying up his finger, and a new \nglass had been got, and the tools, and the ladder, and the chair, and the \ncandle had been brought, he would have another go, the whole family, \nincluding the girl and the charwoman, standing round in a semi-circle, \nready to help.  Two people would have to hold the chair, and a third \nwould help him up on it, and hold him there, and a fourth would hand him \na nail, and a fifth would pass him up the hammer, and he would take hold \nof the nail, and drop it.",
        "“There!” he would say, in an injured tone, “now the nail’s gone.”",
        "And we would all have to go down on our knees and grovel for it, while he \nwould stand on the chair, and grunt, and want to know if he was to be \nkept there all the evening.",
        "The nail would be found at last, but by that time he would have lost the \nhammer.",
        "“Where’s the hammer?  What did I do with the hammer?  Great heavens!  \nSeven of you, gaping round there, and you don’t know what I did with the \nhammer!”",
        "We would find the hammer for him, and then he would have lost sight of \nthe mark he had made on the wall, where the nail was to go in, and each \nof us had to get up on the chair, beside him, and see if we could find \nit; and we would each discover it in a different place, and he would call \nus all fools, one after another, and tell us to get down.  And he would \ntake the rule, and re-measure, and find that he wanted half thirty-one \nand three-eighths inches from the corner, and would try to do it in his \nhead, and go mad.",
        "And we would all try to do it in our heads, and all arrive at different \nresults, and sneer at one another.  And in the general row, the original \nnumber would be forgotten, and Uncle Podger would have to measure it \nagain.",
        "He would use a bit of string this time, and at the critical moment, when \nthe old fool was leaning over the chair at an angle of forty-five, and \ntrying to reach a point three inches beyond what was possible for him to \nreach, the string would slip, and down he would slide on to the piano, a \nreally fine musical effect being produced by the suddenness with which \nhis head and body struck all the notes at the same time.",
        "And Aunt Maria would say that she would not allow the children to stand \nround and hear such language.",
        "At last, Uncle Podger would get the spot fixed again, and put the point \nof the nail on it with his left hand, and take the hammer in his right \nhand.  And, with the first blow, he would smash his thumb, and drop the \nhammer, with a yell, on somebody’s toes.",
        "Aunt Maria would mildly observe that, next time Uncle Podger was going to \nhammer a nail into the wall, she hoped he’d let her know in time, so that \nshe could make arrangements to go and spend a week with her mother while \nit was being done.",
        "“Oh! you women, you make such a fuss over everything,” Uncle Podger would \nreply, picking himself up.  “Why, I LIKE doing a little job of this \nsort.”",
        "And then he would have another try, and, at the second blow, the nail \nwould go clean through the plaster, and half the hammer after it, and \nUncle Podger be precipitated against the wall with force nearly \nsufficient to flatten his nose.",
        "Then we had to find the rule and the string again, and a new hole was \nmade; and, about midnight, the picture would be up – very crooked and \ninsecure, the wall for yards round looking as if it had been smoothed \ndown with a rake, and everybody dead beat and wretched – except Uncle \nPodger.",
        "“There you are,” he would say, stepping heavily off the chair on to the \ncharwoman’s corns, and surveying the mess he had made with evident pride.  \n“Why, some people would have had a man in to do a little thing like \nthat!”",
        "Harris will be just that sort of man when he grows up, I know, and I told \nhim so.  I said I could not permit him to take so much labour upon \nhimself.  I said:",
        "“No; YOU get the paper, and the pencil, and the catalogue, and George \nwrite down, and I’ll do the work.”",
        "The first list we made out had to be discarded.  It was clear that the \nupper reaches of the Thames would not allow of the navigation of a boat \nsufficiently large to take the things we had set down as indispensable; \nso we tore the list up, and looked at one another!",
        "George said:",
        "“You know we are on a wrong track altogether.  We must not think of the \nthings we could do with, but only of the things that we can’t do \nwithout.”",
        "George comes out really quite sensible at times.  You’d be surprised.  I \ncall that downright wisdom, not merely as regards the present case, but \nwith reference to our trip up the river of life, generally.  How many \npeople, on that voyage, load up the boat till it is ever in danger of \nswamping with a store of foolish things which they think essential to the \npleasure and comfort of the trip, but which are really only useless \nlumber.",
        "How they pile the poor little craft mast-high with fine clothes and big \nhouses; with useless servants, and a host of swell friends that do not \ncare twopence for them, and that they do not care three ha’pence for; \nwith expensive entertainments that nobody enjoys, with formalities and \nfashions, with pretence and ostentation, and with – oh, heaviest, maddest \nlumber of all! – the dread of what will my neighbour think, with luxuries \nthat only cloy, with pleasures that bore, with empty show that, like the \ncriminal’s iron crown of yore, makes to bleed and swoon the aching head \nthat wears it!",
        "It is lumber, man – all lumber!  Throw it overboard.  It makes the boat \nso heavy to pull, you nearly faint at the oars.  It makes it so \ncumbersome and dangerous to manage, you never know a moment’s freedom \nfrom anxiety and care, never gain a moment’s rest for dreamy laziness – \nno time to watch the windy shadows skimming lightly o’er the shallows, or \nthe glittering sunbeams flitting in and out among the ripples, or the \ngreat trees by the margin looking down at their own image, or the woods \nall green and golden, or the lilies white and yellow, or the sombre-\nwaving rushes, or the sedges, or the orchis, or the blue forget-me-nots.",
        "Throw the lumber over, man!  Let your boat of life be light, packed with \nonly what you need – a homely home and simple pleasures, one or two \nfriends, worth the name, someone to love and someone to love you, a cat, \na dog, and a pipe or two, enough to eat and enough to wear, and a little \nmore than enough to drink; for thirst is a dangerous thing.",
        "You will find the boat easier to pull then, and it will not be so liable \nto upset, and it will not matter so much if it does upset; good, plain \nmerchandise will stand water.  You will have time to think as well as to \nwork.  Time to drink in life’s sunshine – time to listen to the AEolian \nmusic that the wind of God draws from the human heart-strings around us – \ntime to -",
        "I beg your pardon, really.  I quite forgot.",
        "Well, we left the list to George, and he began it.",
        "“We won’t take a tent, suggested George; “we will have a boat with a \ncover.  It is ever so much simpler, and more comfortable.”",
        "It seemed a good thought, and we adopted it.  I do not know whether you \nhave ever seen the thing I mean.  You fix iron hoops up over the boat, \nand stretch a huge canvas over them, and fasten it down all round, from \nstem to stern, and it converts the boat into a sort of little house, and \nit is beautifully cosy, though a trifle stuffy; but there, everything has \nits drawbacks, as the man said when his mother-in-law died, and they came \ndown upon him for the funeral expenses.",
        "George said that in that case we must take a rug each, a lamp, some soap, \na brush and comb (between us), a toothbrush (each), a basin, some tooth-\npowder, some shaving tackle (sounds like a French exercise, doesn’t it?), \nand a couple of big-towels for bathing.  I notice that people always make \ngigantic arrangements for bathing when they are going anywhere near the \nwater, but that they don’t bathe much when they are there.",
        "It is the same when you go to the sea-side.  I always determine – when \nthinking over the matter in London – that I’ll get up early every \nmorning, and go and have a dip before breakfast, and I religiously pack \nup a pair of drawers and a bath towel.  I always get red bathing drawers.  \nI rather fancy myself in red drawers.  They suit my complexion so.  But \nwhen I get to the sea I don’t feel somehow that I want that early morning \nbathe nearly so much as I did when I was in town.",
        "On the contrary, I feel more that I want to stop in bed till the last \nmoment, and then come down and have my breakfast.  Once or twice virtue \nhas triumphed, and I have got out at six and half-dressed myself, and \nhave taken my drawers and towel, and stumbled dismally off.  But I \nhaven’t enjoyed it.  They seem to keep a specially cutting east wind, \nwaiting for me, when I go to bathe in the early morning; and they pick \nout all the three-cornered stones, and put them on the top, and they \nsharpen up the rocks and cover the points over with a bit of sand so that \nI can’t see them, and they take the sea and put it two miles out, so that \nI have to huddle myself up in my arms and hop, shivering, through six \ninches of water.  And when I do get to the sea, it is rough and quite \ninsulting.",
        "One huge wave catches me up and chucks me in a sitting posture, as hard \nas ever it can, down on to a rock which has been put there for me.  And, \nbefore I’ve said “Oh! Ugh!” and found out what has gone, the wave comes \nback and carries me out to mid-ocean.  I begin to strike out frantically \nfor the shore, and wonder if I shall ever see home and friends again, and \nwish I’d been kinder to my little sister when a boy (when I was a boy, I \nmean).  Just when I have given up all hope, a wave retires and leaves me \nsprawling like a star-fish on the sand, and I get up and look back and \nfind that I’ve been swimming for my life in two feet of water.  I hop \nback and dress, and crawl home, where I have to pretend I liked it.",
        "In the present instance, we all talked as if we were going to have a long \nswim every morning.",
        "George said it was so pleasant to wake up in the boat in the fresh \nmorning, and plunge into the limpid river.  Harris said there was nothing \nlike a swim before breakfast to give you an appetite.  He said it always \ngave him an appetite.  George said that if it was going to make Harris \neat more than Harris ordinarily ate, then he should protest against \nHarris having a bath at all.",
        "He said there would be quite enough hard work in towing sufficient food \nfor Harris up against stream, as it was.",
        "I urged upon George, however, how much pleasanter it would be to have \nHarris clean and fresh about the boat, even if we did have to take a few \nmore hundredweight of provisions; and he got to see it in my light, and \nwithdrew his opposition to Harris’s bath.",
        "Agreed, finally, that we should take THREE bath towels, so as not to keep \neach other waiting.",
        "For clothes, George said two suits of flannel would be sufficient, as we \ncould wash them ourselves, in the river, when they got dirty.  We asked \nhim if he had ever tried washing flannels in the river, and he replied: \n“No, not exactly himself like; but he knew some fellows who had, and it \nwas easy enough;” and Harris and I were weak enough to fancy he knew what \nhe was talking about, and that three respectable young men, without \nposition or influence, and with no experience in washing, could really \nclean their own shirts and trousers in the river Thames with a bit of \nsoap.",
        "We were to learn in the days to come, when it was too late, that George \nwas a miserable impostor, who could evidently have known nothing whatever \nabout the matter.  If you had seen these clothes after – but, as the \nshilling shockers say, we anticipate.",
        "George impressed upon us to take a change of under-things and plenty of \nsocks, in case we got upset and wanted a change; also plenty of \nhandkerchiefs, as they would do to wipe things, and a pair of leather \nboots as well as our boating shoes, as we should want them if we got \nupset.",
