        "The castle at Chillingham, the seat of the Earl of Tankerville, is a\nremarkably picturesque building, erected in the reign of Elizabeth, on\nthe site of an older fortress. The castle, which is now in the\noccupation of Sir Andrew Noble, to whom it has been let by Lord\nTankerville, contains many valuable portraits.",
        "An ancestor of the Earl of Tankerville, Charles Lord Ossulston, came\ninto the property in 1695 by marriage with the daughter and heiress of\nLord Grey, Earl of Tankerville, a descendant of the Greys of Chillingham\nand Wark, who had much property in Glendale.",
        "The herds of cattle at Chillingham are believed to be survivors of Bos\nprimigenius, the wild ox of Europe, which is the supposed progenitor of\nour domestic cattle. This fact is of great scientific interest and is\nanalogous to the preservation of the few remaining buffaloes in America,\nonly in this case these wild cattle have been preserved through much\nchanged conditions for a vastly longer period.",
        "The King, when Prince of Wales, shot one of these animals, but in doing\nso had a rather narrow escape. The chief external appearances\ndistinguishing the cattle from all others are as follows–\"their colour\nis invariably white; muzzles black, the whole of the inside of the ear\nand about one-third of the outside, from the lips downwards, red; horns\nwhite with black tips, very fine and bent upwards; some of the bulls\nhave a thin upright mane about an inch and a half or two inches long.”",
        "It should be pointed out that there is some danger in encountering any\nof the herd in the absence of the park-keepers. The calves have been\nnoticed to have the wild characteristic of dropping when suddenly\nsurprised.",
        "A reproduction is given opposite of Landseer’s picture of the wild\ncattle.",
