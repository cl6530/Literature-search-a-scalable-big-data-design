        "The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.",
        "“Who are you?” said the Caterpillar.",
        "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, Sir, just at present—at least I know\nwho I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have\nchanged several times since then.”",
        "“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar, sternly. “Explain\nyourself!”",
        "“I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, Sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\nnot myself, you see.”",
        "“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied, very\npolitely, “for I can’t understand it myself, to begin with; and being\nso many different sizes in a day is very confusing.”",
        "“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\nqueer, won’t you?”",
        "“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice: “all I\nknow is, it would feel very queer to me.”",
        "“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are you?”",
        "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.",
        "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such very\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\nthink you ought to tell me who you are, first.”",
        "“Why?” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Here was another puzzling question; and, as Alice could not think of\nany good reason, and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very\nunpleasant state of mind, she turned away.",
        "“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\nimportant to say!”",
        "This sounded promising, certainly. Alice turned and came back again.",
        "“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\ncould.",
        "“No,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking; but at last it unfolded\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\nthink you’re changed, do you?”",
        "“I’m afraid I am, Sir,” said Alice. “I can’t remember things as I\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”",
        "“Can’t remember what things?” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, I’ve tried to say, ’How doth the little busy bee,’ but it all\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.",
        "“Repeat, ’You are old, Father William,’” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice folded her hands, and began:",
        "“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Not quite right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly: “some of the\nwords have got altered.”",
        "“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar, decidedly;\nand there was silence for some minutes.",
        "The Caterpillar was the first to speak.",
        "“What size do you want to be?” it asked.",
        "“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”",
        "“I don’t know,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in all her\nlife before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.",
        "“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, I should like to be a little larger, Sir, if you wouldn’t\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”",
        "“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).",
        "“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And\nshe thought to herself, “I wish the creature wouldn’t be so easily\noffended!”",
        "“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\nhookah into its mouth, and began smoking again.",
        "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\nmushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it\nwent, “One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will\nmake you grow shorter.”",
        "“One side of what? The other side of what?” thought Alice to\nherself.",
        "“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.",
        "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it;—and, as it was\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However,\nat last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and\nbroke off a bit of the edge with each hand.",
        "“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect.",
        "The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had\nstruck her foot!",
        "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she\nfelt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly:\nso she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was\npressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to\nopen her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a\nmorsel of the left-hand bit.",
        "“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her\nshoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked\ndown, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk\nout a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.",
        "“What can all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where have my\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?\"\nShe was moving them about, as she spoke, but no result seemed to\nfollow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",
        "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to\nfind that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a\nserpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful\nzigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to\nbe nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been\nwandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large\npigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its\nwings.",
        "“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.",
        "“I’m not a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”",
        "“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\ntone, and added, with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, but\nnothing seems to suit them!”",
        "“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.",
        "“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\nhedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\nserpents! There’s no pleasing them!”",
        "Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.",
        "“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\n“but I must be on the lookout for serpents, night and day! Why, I\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”",
        "“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.",
        "“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”",
        "“But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice, “I’m a—I’m a—”",
        "“Well! What are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\ninvent something!”",
        "“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she\nremembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.",
        "“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon, in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\none with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\nno use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!”",
        "“I have tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\nchild; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\nknow.”",
        "“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why, then\nthey’re a kind of serpent: that’s all I can say.”",
        "This was such a new idea to Alice that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding,\n“You’re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it\nmatter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”",
        "“It matters a good deal to me,” said Alice, hastily; “but I’m not\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and, if I was, I shouldn’t want\nyours: I don’t like them raw.”",
        "“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her\nhands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and\nthen at the other, and growing sometimes taller, and sometimes\nshorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual\nheight.",
        "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\nand began talking to herself, as usual, “Come, there’s half my plan\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\nis that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon\nthem this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So\nshe began nibbling at the right-hand bit again, and did not venture to\ngo near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches\nhigh.",
