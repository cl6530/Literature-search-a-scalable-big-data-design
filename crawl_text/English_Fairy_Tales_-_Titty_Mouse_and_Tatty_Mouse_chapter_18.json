        "Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse both lived in a house,",
        "Titty Mouse went a leasing and Tatty Mouse went a leasing,",
        "So they both went a leasing.",
        "Titty Mouse leased an ear of corn, and Tatty Mouse leased an ear of\ncorn,",
        "So they both leased an ear of corn.",
        "Titty Mouse made a pudding, and Tatty Mouse made a pudding,",
        "So they both made a pudding.",
        "And Tatty Mouse put her pudding into the pot to boil,",
        "But when Titty went to put hers in, the pot tumbled over, and scalded\nher to death.",
        "Then Tatty sat down and wept; then a three-legged stool said: “Tatty,\nwhy do you weep?” “Titty’s dead,” said Tatty, “and so I weep;” “then,\"\nsaid the stool, “I’ll hop,” so the stool hopped.",
        "Then a broom in the corner of the room said, “Stool, why do you hop?\"\n“Oh!” said the stool, “Titty’s dead, and Tatty weeps, and so I hop;\"\n“then,” said the broom, “I’ll sweep,” so the broom began to sweep.",
        "“Then,” said the door, “Broom, why do you sweep?” “Oh!” said the broom,\n“Titty’s dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and so I sweep;\"\n“Then,” said the door, “I’ll jar,” so the door jarred.",
        "“Then,” said the window, “Door, why do you jar?” “Oh!” said the door,\n“Titty’s dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom\nsweeps, and so I jar.”",
        "“Then,” said the window, “I’ll creak,” so the window creaked. Now\nthere was an old form outside the house, and when the window creaked,\nthe form said: “Window, why do you creak?” “Oh!” said the window,\n“Titty’s dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom\nsweeps, the door jars, and so I creak.”",
        "“Then,” said the old form, “I’ll run round the house;” then the old\nform ran round the house. Now there was a fine large walnut-tree\ngrowing by the cottage, and the tree said to the form: “Form, why do\nyou run round the house?” “Oh!” said the form, “Titty’s dead, and\nTatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars,\nand the window creaks, and so I run round the house.”",
        "“Then,” said the walnut-tree, “I’ll shed my leaves,” so the walnut-\ntree shed all its beautiful green leaves. Now there was a little bird\nperched on one of the boughs of the tree, and when all the leaves\nfell, it said: “Walnut-tree, why do you shed your leaves?” “Oh!” said\nthe tree, “Titty’s dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the\nbroom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs\nround the house, and so I shed my leaves.”",
        "“Then,” said the little bird, “I’ll moult all my feathers,” so he\nmoulted all his pretty feathers. Now there was a little girl walking\nbelow, carrying a jug of milk for her brothers and sisters’ supper,\nand when she saw the poor little bird moult all its feathers, she\nsaid: “Little bird, why do you moult all your feathers?” “Oh!” said\nthe little bird, “Titty’s dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and\nthe broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form\nruns round the house, the walnut-tree sheds its leaves, and so I moult\nall my feathers.”",
        "“Then,” said the little girl, “I’ll spill the milk,” so she dropt the\npitcher and spilt the milk. Now there was an old man just by on the\ntop of a ladder thatching a rick, and when he saw the little girl\nspill the milk, he said: “Little girl, what do you mean by spilling\nthe milk, your little brothers and sisters must go without their\nsupper.” Then said the little girl: “Titty’s dead, and Tatty weeps,\nthe stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window\ncreaks, the old form runs round the house, the walnut-tree sheds all\nits leaves, the little bird moults all its feathers, and so I spill\nthe milk.”",
        "“Oh!” said the old man, “then I’ll tumble off the ladder and break my\nneck,” so he tumbled off the ladder and broke his neck; and when the\nold man broke his neck, the great walnut-tree fell down with a crash,\nand upset the old form and house, and the house falling knocked the\nwindow out, and the window knocked the door down, and the door upset\nthe broom, and the broom upset the stool, and poor little Tatty Mouse\nwas buried beneath the ruins.",
