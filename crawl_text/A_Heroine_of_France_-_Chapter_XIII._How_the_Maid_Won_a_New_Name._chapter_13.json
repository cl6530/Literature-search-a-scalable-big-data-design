        "“Entrez, entrez–de la part de Dieu–all is yours!”",
        "Thus spoke the Maid, as we rushed the tower of the boulevard, the\nEnglish flying this way and that before us. The Maid found herself\nface to face with the commander–that Sir William Glasdale, who had\ncalled her vile names a few days before, and had promised to burn\nher for a witch if once she fell into his hands.",
        "But she had no ill words for him, as she saw him, sword in hand,\nseeking to make a last stand upon the drawbridge leading to Les\nTourelles.",
        "“Now yield you, Classidas,” she said; “I bear you no ill will. I\nhave great pity for your soul. Yield you, and all shall be well.”",
        "But he would not listen; his face was black like a thundercloud,\nand with his picked bodyguard of men, he retreated backwards, sword\nin hand, upon the bridge, seeking to gain the other tower, not\nknowing its desperate condition, and hoping there to make a last\nstand.",
        "But he was not destined to achieve his end. Suddenly the bridge\ngave way beneath his feet, and he and his men were all precipitated\ninto the water. It looked to us as though a miracle had been\nwrought before our eyes; as though the gaze of the Maid had done\nit. But the truth was afterwards told us, that a fire ship from the\ncity had been sent across and had burned the bridge, cutting off\nthe retreat of the English that way.",
        "And now we heard the din of battle going on within Les Tourelles;\nfor La Hire had crossed the repaired bridge with a gallant band of\nsoldiers, and our men, hearing the shouts of their comrades, and\nthe cries of the trapped English, flung themselves into boats, or\nswam over, sword in mouth, anything to get to the scene of the\nfray; whilst others set to work with planks, and whatever they\ncould lay hands upon, to mend the broken drawbridge that they might\nswarm across into Les Tourelles and join in the final act of\nvictory, that should free Orleans from the iron grip in which she\nhad been held so long.",
        "But the face of the Maid was troubled, as she looked into the dark\nwater which had closed over the head of Glasdale and his men. She\nhad seized upon a coil of rope; she stood ready to fling it towards\nthem when they rose; but encased as they were in their heavy mail,\nthere was no rising for them. Long did she gaze into the black,\nbloodstained water; but she gazed in vain; and when she raised her\neyes, I saw that they were swimming in tears.",
        "“I would we might have saved them,” she spoke, with a little catch\nin her voice, “I have such great pity for their souls!”",
        "These were the first words I heard the Maid speak after her\nwonderful victory had been won; and whilst others went hither and\nthither, mad or drunk with joy, she busied herself about the\nwounded, making no distinction betwixt friend or foe, sending\nurgent message into the city for priests to come forth and bring\nthe last Sacraments with them, and so long as there were any dying\nto be confessed or consoled, or wounded to be cared for and\ntransported into the city, she seemed to have no thought for aught\nbeside. Thankful joy was indeed in her heart, but her tender\nwoman’s pity was so stirred by sights of suffering and death that\nfor the moment she could think of nothing else.",
        "Thus the daylight faded, and we began to think of return. How shall\nI describe the sight which greeted our eyes in the gathering dusk,\nas we looked towards the city? One might have thought that the\nEnglish had fired it, so bright was the glare in which it was\nenveloped; but we knew better. Bonfires were blazing in every\nsquare, in every open place. Nay, more, from the very roofs of\ntower and church great pillars of flame were ascending to the\nheavens.",
        "Joy bells had rung before this, but never with such a wild\njubilation, such a clamour of palpitating triumph. The city had\ngone mad in its joy–and it was no marvel–and all were awaiting\nthe return of the Maid, to whom this miraculous deliverance was\ndue. Eight days–eight days of the Maid–and the seven-months’\nsiege was raised! Was it wonderful they should hunger for her\npresence amongst them? Was it wonderful that every house should\nseek to hang out a white banner in honour of the Angelic Maid, and\nher pure whiteness of soul and body?",
        "“I will come to you by the bridge,” had been her own word; and now,\nbehold, the bridge was there! Like Trojans had the men worked\nbeneath the eagle eyes of La Hire. An army had already crossed from\nthe city; now that their task was done, the Maid’s white charger\nhad been led across, and the cry was all for her, for her; that she\nshould let the people see her alive and well, now that her task was\naccomplished and Orleans was free!",
        "She let us mount her upon her horse, and D’Aulon marched in front\nwith the great white standard. Weary and white and wan was she,\nwith the stress of the fight, with the pain and loss of blood from\nher wound, above all, with her deep, unfailing pity for the\nsufferings she had been forced to witness, for the souls gone to\ntheir last account without the sacred offices of the Church.",
        "All this weighed upon her young spirit, and gave a strange,\nethereal loveliness to her pale face and shining eyes. Methought\nshe seemed almost more like some angelic presence in our midst than\na creature of human flesh and blood.",
        "The Generals formed an advance guard before her. The soldiers followed,\nrank behind rank, in the rear. We of her household rode immediately in\nher wake, ready to protect her, if need be, from the too great pressure\nof the crowd. And so we crossed the hastily-repaired bridge, and entered\nby the Bride Gate–or St.  Catherine’s gate, as it was equally called;\nfor a figure of St.  Catherine stands carved in a niche above the porch,\nand I saw the Maid glance upwards at it as she passed through, a smile\nupon her lips.",
        "Shall I ever forget the thunder of applause which fell upon our\nears as we passed into the city through the bridge? It was like the\n“sound of many waters\"–deafening in volume and intensity. And was\nit wonder? Had not something very like a miracle been wrought? For\nhad not rumours reached the city many times that day of the death\nof the Deliverer in the hour of victory? None well knew what to\nbelieve till they saw her in their midst, and then the cry which\nrent the heavens was such as methinks is heard but once in a\nlifetime.",
        "I know not who first spoke the words; but once spoken, they were\ncaught up by ten thousand lips, and the blazing heavens echoed them\nback in great waves of rolling sound:",
        "“THE MAID OF ORLEANS! THE MAID OF ORLEANS! Welcome, honour, glory,\npraise to THE MAID OF ORLEANS!”",
        "The people were well-nigh mad with joy; they rushed upon her to\nkiss her hands, her knees, the folds of her banner, the neck or the\nflanks of her horse. In the red glare of the hundred bonfires the\nwhiteness of her armour seemed to take a new lustre. The rent upon\nthe shoulder could be plainly seen, showing where the arrow had\ntorn its way. Women sobbed aloud as they looked; men cursed the\nhand which had shot the bolt; all joined in frantic cheers of joy\nto see her riding alone, erect and smiling, though with a dreamy\nstillness of countenance which physical lassitude in part accounted\nfor.",
        "“I thank you, my friends, I thank you,” she kept saying, as though\nno other words would come, save when now and again she would add,\n“But to God must you give your thanks and blessings. It is He who\nhas delivered you.”",
        "It was not far to the house of the Treasurer, and there in the\nthreshold stood the little Charlotte, a great wreath of bay and\nlaurel in her tiny hands. She was lifted up in her father’s strong\narms, and ere the Maid was able to dismount from her horse the\nlittle one had placed the triumphal wreath upon her fair head.",
        "O, what a shout arose! It was like the mighty burst of some great\nthunderstorm. The Maid, blushing now at the tumult of applause,\nstretched out her arms, took the little one into them, and held her\nin a close embrace whilst she bowed her last graceful thanks to the\njoy-maddened crowd. Then she slipped from her horse, and holding\nthe little one fast by the hand, disappeared into the house, whilst\nthe people reluctantly dispersed to hear the story all over again\nfrom the soldiers pouring in, each with some tale of his own to\ntell of the prowess of THE MAID OF ORLEANS.",
        "Yes, that was the name by which she was henceforth to be known. The\ncity was wild with joy and pride thus to christen her. And she,\nhaving crossed by the bridge, as she had said, sat down for a brief\nwhile to that festal board which had been spread for her. But\nfatigue soon over-mastering her, she retired to her room, only\npausing to look at us all and say:",
        "“Tomorrow is the Lord’s own day of rest. Remember that, my friends.\nLet there be no fighting, no pursuit, no martial exercise, whatever\nthe foe may threaten or do. Tomorrow must be a day of thanksgiving\nand praise. Look to it that my words are obeyed.”",
        "They said she slept like a child that night; yet with the early\nlight of day she was up, kneeling in the Cathedral with her\nhousehold beside her, listening to the sound of chant and prayer,\nreceiving the Holy Sacrament, the pledge of her Lord’s love.",
        "Not until we had returned from that first duty did she listen to\nwhat was told her anent the movements of the English. They were\ndrawn up in battle array upon the north side of the river, spoke\nthose who had gone to the battlements to look. Thinned as were\ntheir ranks, they were still a formidable host, and from the menace\nof their attitude it might be that they expected the arrival of\nreinforcements. Would it not be well, spoke La Hire, to go forth\nagainst them at once, whilst the soldiers’ hearts were flushed with\nvictory, whilst the memory of yesterday’s triumphs was green within\nthem?",
        "But the Maid, hitherto all in favour of the most dashing and daring\npolicy, answered now, with a shake of the head:",
        "“It is Sunday, my Generals,” she replied; “the day of my Lord. The\nday He has hallowed to His service.”",
        "She paused a moment, and added, quite gently, and without reproach,\n“Had you acted as I did counsel, the English would now have had no\nfooting on the north side of the river; they must needs have fled\naltogether from the neighbourhood of the city. Nevertheless, my\nLord is merciful. He helps, though men hinder His designs. Let no\nman stir forth with carnal weapons against the foe this day. We\nwill use other means to vanquish them.”",
        "Then turning to me, she bid me go to the Bishop, and ask him to\ngive her audience; and shortly she was ushered into his presence,\nand we waited long for her to reappear.",
        "How shall I tell of the wonderful scene which the sun looked down\nupon that bright May morning, when the purpose of the Maid became\nfully revealed to us? Even now it seems rather as a dream, than as\nan incident in a terrible war.",
        "Out upon the level plain, in full sight of the city, in full view\nof the serried ranks of the English army, a great white altar was\nset up. The army from Orleans marched out and stood bareheaded\nbeneath the walls, unarmed by order of the Maid, save for the small\nweapon every man habitually carried at his belt, citizen as well as\nsoldier. The townspeople flocked to the walls, or out into the\nplain, as pleased them best; and from the Renart Gate there issued\nforth a grave and sumptuous procession; the Bishop in his\nvestments, accompanied by all the ecclesiastics within the city\nwalls, each of them robed, attended by acolytes swinging censers,\nthe incense cloud ascending through the sunny air, tapers swaying\nin the breeze, their light extinguished by the brilliance of the\nsunshine.",
        "The Maid in her white tunic, with a white mantle over her\nshoulders, followed with bent head, leading the little Charlotte by\nthe hand succeeded by her household.",
        "And there, in the sight of the rival armies, High Mass was\ncelebrated by the Bishop, both armies kneeling devoutly, and\nturning towards the Altar as one man. Never have I witnessed such a\nscene. Never shall I witness such another.",
        "The Mass over, the procession filed back through the gate, both\narmies kneeling motionless till it had disappeared. Then the Maid\nrose, and we with her, and followed her in its wake, and the French\narmy, in perfect order, re-entered the city by the appointed gates,\nas had been ordered.",
        "One hour later and the Maid sent D’Aulon up to the battlements to\nlook what the English army was doing. He returned to say that they\nwere still drawn up in rank as before.",
        "“Which way are their faces?” she asked.",
        "“Their faces are turned away from the city,” was the reply.",
        "The countenance of the Maid brightened with a great light.",
        "“Then let them go, a part de Dieu!” she answered. “My God, I thank\nThee for this great grace!”",
        "And so, without further battle or bloodshed, the English army\nmarched away from Orleans; and upon the next morning not a man of\nthe foe was left; and the citizens pouring out from the town,\ndestroyed, with acclamations of joy, those great bastilles, which\nhad so long sheltered the foe and threatened the safety of the\ncity.",
        "It was a day ever to be remembered. The bells pealed ceaselessly,\nthe houses were decked with garlands, white banners or silken\npennons floated everywhere, the townsfolk arrayed themselves in\nholiday garb, and poured out through the gates to wander at will\nover the plain, so lately held by the English. Gladness and the\nwonder of a great relief was stamped upon every face, and\nconstantly songs of triumph arose or thunders of applause, of which\nthe burden always was–THE MAID OF ORLEANS! THE MAID OF ORLEANS!",
        "They would have kept her with them for ever, if it might so have\nbeen. They talked wildly, yet earnestly, of building her a palace,\nwhere she should live at ease all the rest of her days, the object\nof universal admiration and homage.",
        "But the Maid listened to such words, when repeated to her, with a\ndreamy smile. Her wound required rest; and for two days she\nconsented to remain quiet in the house of the Treasurer, lying for\nthe most part upon a couch in a great cool chamber, with the little\nCharlotte for her companion and playfellow. She sometimes rose and\nshowed herself at a window in answer to the tumultuous shoutings of\nthe crowd without; and she received with pleasure some great\nbaskets and bouquets of flowers which the wives and children of the\ncitizens had culled for her. But she gently put aside all\nsuggestions of rewards for herself, which some would fain have\nbestowed upon the Deliverer, and which men of all ranks were but\ntoo ready to claim and receive for service rendered.",
        "“I have all that I want, myself–and more,” she said; “if any would\noffer gifts, let them be thank offerings to the Lord. Let the poor\nreceive alms, let Masses be sung for the souls of those killed in\nthe war; but for me–I want nothing but the love of the people of\nFrance. I am come to do the will of my Lord. I ask only His\napproving smile.”",
        "And all the while she was eagerly desirous to return to the King,\nand urge upon him the need to repair instantly to Rheims, and there\nreceive his crown. To her he was not truly King till he had been\nanointed as such. She knew that the blow to the English arms just\nstruck must have a paralysing effect upon their forces, and that a\nrapid march with even a small army would be accomplished without\nresistance, if only it were quickly made.",
        "I need not say that the city of Rheims lay in the very heart of\nterritory owning the English sway. To reach that city we must\nperforce march right through a hostile country, garrisoned by the\nenemy. But of that the Maid made light.",
        "“The hearts of the people will turn towards us,” she said. “They\nhave submitted to the English yoke; but they are Frenchmen still.\nOnce let them see that the power of the enemy is broken, and they\nwill rally to our standard. But precious time should not be lost.\nThe Dauphin should place himself at the head of such an army as he\ncan spare for the march, and journey forthwith to Rheims. There\nshall the crown be set upon his head–the pledge and earnest that\none day he shall rule the whole realm of France, as his fathers did\nbefore him!”",
        "And so, before a week had passed, we set forth with the Maid to go\nto the King, who had by this time moved his Court from Chinon to\nLoches, another fortress upon the Loire, where there was space for\nhis train, and which could, if necessary, be fortified against a\nsiege.",
        "It was a strange journey–more like a triumphal progress than\nanything we had yet met with. The fame of the Maid and her\nmiraculous exploit in the matter of the siege of Orleans had gone\nbefore her, and from every town or village through which she passed\nthe people flocked out to see her, bearing garlands and banners,\ncrowding about her, asking her blessing, seeking to touch her,\npouring out blessings and praises, so that the heart of anyone less\nfilled with the humility which comes from above must needs have\nbeen altogether puffed up and filled with pride.",
        "But it was never so with the Maid. Her gentle courtesy and devout\nhumility never failed her. Lovingly and gratefully she received\nlove and affection, but praise and honour she set aside, bidding\nall remember that to God alone belonged the issues from death, and\nthat she was but an instrument in His mighty hands.",
        "We wondered how she would be received at the Court, and whether La\nTremouille and her other adversaries had been convinced of her\ndivine mission, and would now remove all opposition. As we\napproached the fortress we saw that flags were floating from every\ntower; that the place wore a festive aspect, and that the town was\npouring out to welcome us and gaze upon the Maid.",
        "Then, with a great fanfare of trumpets, the gates of the fortress\nwere flung wide open, and forth came a gay procession, in the midst\nof which, we could not doubt, rode the King himself.",
        "Yes, there was no doubt of it. The crowd parted this way and that,\nand we saw how the young King himself was marching towards us, and\nat the sight of the Maid, not only did every courtier in the train\nuncover, but the King himself bared his head, and bowed low to the\nMAID OF ORLEANS.",
        "She was off her horse in a moment, kneeling at his feet; but he\nraised her instantly, held her hands in his, gave her thanks with\ntrue emotion in face and voice, and, turning to her brothers, who\nrode amongst us of her household, he cried to them in loud tones,\nsaying how he had decreed that the family of the D’Arcs should\nhenceforth have the right to quarter the hues of France on their\narms! An empty honour, perhaps, to simple peasants; and yet an\nhonour that the proudest families in the land might envy!",
        "They carried her into the fortress. The two Queens and the ladies\nof the Court knew not how to make enough of her. They seemed to\nthink that our coming must be regarded as the signal for an\noutburst of merrymaking and carousing, such as the King found so\nmuch to his liking.",
        "It amazed us to find him still wrapped in idle luxury, joyful, it\nis true, over the relief of Orleans, over the discomfiture of the\nEnglish; but as indisposed as ever to take the field himself, or to\nput himself at the head of an army and march to his coronation as\nthe Maid instantly urged him.",
        "“Gentle Dauphin, the Lord would have you King of your realm; He\nwould set the crown upon your head. He has smitten your enemies and\nscattered them. Then wherefore not do His will and march to the\nappointed spot? All will be well if you but follow His counsels.”",
        "“But, Maiden, I have so few troops; and I have no money; and the\nway lies through a hostile land,” the King would urge, when day\nafter day she pleaded with him. “All my counsellors advise delay.\nIs it not right that I should listen to them as well as to you?\nWherefore such haste? Is it not wiser to act with deliberation and\nprudence?”",
        "“It is right to follow the voice of the Lord,” spoke the Maid with\ngrave and forceful earnestness, “and to put your trust in Him\nrather than in any child of man.”",
        "But the King could not be persuaded; indolence and fear held him\ncaptive, whilst his traitorous advisers sought by every means to\nundermine the influence of the Maid. And although in this they were\nnot successful, for he believed in her mission, admired her\nprowess, and looked to her for guidance and help, he must needs\nlisten also to these others who were of contrary mind, and so the\nweary days dragged on, and nothing was done.",
        "“Noble Dauphin,” pleaded the Maid at last, “hold not such long or\nso many councils; or if, indeed, these be needful to you, let me, I\npray you, go forth again with a small army and clear the way. And\nwhen all the country betwixt this place and Rheims has submitted to\nyour power, then follow yourself, and take your kingdom!”",
        "Ah me!–to think that he, a King, could consent again to let her go\nthus, whilst he remained in ease and indolence surrounded by his\nCourt! But so it was. What she could not persuade him to do\nhimself, she at last obtained leave to do for him, and with a\njoyful face she came to us with the news:",
        "“Gentlemen and my good comrades, be ready for a speedy march; we\nwill go forward and clear the way; and afterwards the Dauphin shall\nfollow and be made King!”",
