        "On the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the\nevening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of\nmy colleague and old school-companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good\ndeal surprised by this; for we were by no means in the habit of\ncorrespondence; I had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the\nnight before; and I could imagine nothing in our intercourse that\nshould justify formality of registration. The contents increased\nmy wonder; for this is how the letter ran:",
        "                                 “10th December, 18 —",
        "“Dear Lanyon, You are one of my oldest friends; and although we\nmay have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot\nremember, at least on my side, any break in our affection. There\nwas never a day when, if you had said to me, ’Jekyll, my life, my\nhonour, my reason, depend upon you,’ I would not have sacrificed\nmy left hand to help you. Lanyon, my life, my honour my reason,\nare all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night I am lost. You might suppose, after this\npreface, that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable\nto grant. Judge for yourself.",
        "“I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night — ay,\neven if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a\ncab, unless your carriage should be actually at the door; and\nwith this letter in your hand for consultation, to drive straight\nto my house. Poole, my butler, has his orders; you will find, him\nwaiting your arrival with a locksmith. The door of my cabinet is\nthen to be forced: and you are to go in alone; to open the glazed\npress (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if it be\nshut; and to draw out, with all its contents as they stand, the\nfourth drawer from the top or (which is the same thing) the third\nfrom the bottom. In my extreme distress of wind, I have a morbid\nfear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in error, you may know\nthe right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a\npaper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to\nCavendish Square exactly as it stands.",
        "“That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You\nshould be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this,\nlong before midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin,\nnot only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither\nbe prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be\npreferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I\nhave to ask you to be alone in your consulting-room, to admit\nwith your own hand into the house a man who will present himself\nin my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will\nhave brought with you from my cabinet. Then you will have played\nyour part and earned my gratitude completely. Five minutes\nafterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have\nunderstood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and\nthat by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must\nappear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or\nthe shipwreck of my reason.",
        "“Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my\nheart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a\npossibility. Think of me at this hour, in a strange place,\nlabouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can\nexaggerate, and yet well aware that, if you will but punctually\nserve me, my troubles will roll away like a story that is told.\nServe me, my dear Lanyon, and save                               \n                                        Your friend,\n                                                                 \nH. J.“",
        "“P. S. I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck\nupon my soul. It is possible that the postoffice may fail me, and\nthis letter not come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case,\ndear Lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for\nyou in the course of the day; and once more expect my messenger\nat midnight. It may then already be too late; and if that night\npasses without event, you will know that you have seen the last\nof Henry Jekyll.”",
        "Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was\ninsane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt,\nI felt bound to do as he requested. The less I understood of this\nfarrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance;\nand an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave\nresponsibility. I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom,\nand drove straight to Jekyll’s house. The butler was awaiting my\narrival; he had received by the same post as mine a registered\nletter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a\ncarpenter. The tradesmen came while we were yet speaking; and we\nmoved in a body to old Dr. Denman’s surgical theatre, from which\n(as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll’s private cabinet is most\nconveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock\nexcellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and\nhave to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the\nlocksmith was near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hours’ work, the door stood open. The press marked\nE was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up with\nstraw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish\nSquare.",
        "Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly\nenough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing\nchemist; so that it was plain they were of Jekyll’s private\nmanufacture; and when I opened one of the wrappers I found what\nseemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour. The\nphial, to which I next turned my attention, might have been about\nhalf-full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the\nsense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some\nvolatile ether. At the other ingredients I could make no guess.\nThe book was an ordinary version-book and contained little but a\nseries of dates. These covered a period of many years, but I\nobserved that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite\nabruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,\nusually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps\nsix times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very\nearly in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation,\n“total failure!!!” All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told\nme little that was definite. Here were a phial of some tincture,\na paper of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll’s investigations) to\nno end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these\narticles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the\nlife of my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one\nplace, why could he not go to another? And even granting some\nimpediment, why was this gentleman to be received by me in\nsecret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I was\ndealing with a case of cerebral disease: and though I dismissed\nmy servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be\nfound in some posture of self-defence.",
        "Twelve o’clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker\nsounded very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons,\nand found a small man crouching against the pillars of the\nportico.",
        "“Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?” I asked.",
        "He told me “yes” by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden\nhim enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance\ninto the darkness of the square. There was a policeman not far\noff, advancing with his bull’s eye open; and at the sight, I\nthought my visitor started and made greater haste.",
        "These particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I\nfollowed him into the bright light of the consulting-room, I kept\nmy hand ready on my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I had never set eyes on him before,\nso much was certain. He was small, as I have said; I was struck\nbesides with the shocking expression of his face, with his\nremarkable combination of great muscular activity and great\napparent debility of constitution, and — last but not least —\nwith the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood.\nThis bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was\naccompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse. At the time, I set\nit down to some idiosyncratic, personal distaste, and merely\nwondered at the acuteness of the symptoms; but I have since had\nreason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of\nman, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of\nhatred.",
        "This person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,\nstruck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity)\nwas dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person\nlaughable; his clothes, that is to say, although they were of\nrich and sober fabric, were enormously too large for him in every\nmeasurement — the trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to\nkeep them from the ground, the waist of the coat below his\nhaunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon his shoulders.\nStrange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far from\nmoving me to laughter. Rather, as there was something abnormal\nand misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced me —\nsomething seizing, surprising, and revolting — this fresh\ndisparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that\nto my interest in the man’s nature and character, there was added\na curiosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in\nthe world.",
        "These observations, though they have taken so great a space to be\nset down in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was,\nindeed, on fire with sombre excitement.",
        "“Have you got it?” he cried. “Have you got it?” And so lively was\nhis impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought\nto shake me.",
        "I put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang\nalong my blood. “Come, sir,” said I. “You forget that I have not\nyet the pleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.\"\nAnd I showed him an example, and sat down myself in my customary\nseat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a\npatient, as the lateness of the hour, the nature of my\npre-occupations, and the horror I had of my visitor, would suffer\nme to muster.",
        "“I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,” he replied civilly enough. “What\nyou say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its\nheels to my politeness. I come here at the instance of your\ncolleague, Dr. Henry Jekyll, on a piece of business of some\nmoment; and I understood...” He paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could\nsee, in spite of his collected manner, that he was wrestling\nagainst the approaches of the hysteria — “I understood, a\ndrawer...”",
        "But here I took pity on my visitor’s suspense, and some perhaps\non my own growing curiosity.",
        "“There it is, sir,” said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay\non the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.",
        "He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his\nheart: I could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of\nhis jaws; and his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed\nboth for his life and reason.",
        "“Compose yourself,” said I.",
        "He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of\ndespair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he\nuttered one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified.\nAnd the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well\nunder control, “Have you a graduated glass?” he asked.",
        "I rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him\nwhat he asked.",
        "He thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of\nthe red tincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which\nwas at first of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the\ncrystals melted, to brighten in colour, to effervesce audibly,\nand to throw off small fumes of vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition\nceased and the compound changed to a dark purple, which faded\nagain more slowly to a watery green. My visitor, who had watched\nthese metamorphoses with a keen eye, smiled, set down the glass\nupon the table, and then turned and looked upon me with an air of\nscrutiny.",
        "“And now,” said he, “to settle what remains. Will you be wise?\nwill you be guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my\nhand and to go forth from your house without further parley? or\nhas the greed of curiosity too much command of you? Think before\nyou answer, for it shall be done as you decide. As you decide,\nyou shall be left as you were before, and neither richer nor\nwiser, unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal\ndistress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul. Or, if\nyou shall so prefer to choose, a new province of knowledge and\nnew avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you, here, in\nthis room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by a\nprodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.”",
        "“Sir,” said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly\npossessing,” you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder\nthat I hear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I\nhave gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause\nbefore I see the end.”",
        "“It is well,” replied my visitor. “Lanyon,\nyou remember your vows: what follows is under the seal of our\nprofession. And now, you who have so long been bound to the most\nnarrow and material views, you who have denied the virtue of\ntranscendental medicine, you who have derided your superiors —\nbehold!”",
        "He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry\nfollowed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held\non, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I\nlooked there came, I thought, a change — he seemed to swell —\nhis face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt\nand alter — and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and\nleaped back against the wall, my arm raised to shield me from\nthat prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.",
        "“O God!” I screamed, and “O God!” again and again; for there\nbefore my eyes — pale and shaken, and half-fainting, and groping\nbefore him with his hands, like a man restored from death —\nthere stood Henry Jekyll!",
        "What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set\non paper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul\nsickened at it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my\neyes, I ask myself if I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life\nis shaken to its roots; sleep has left me; the deadliest terror\nsits by me at all hours of the day and night; I feel that my days\nare numbered, and that I\nmust die; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral\nturpitude that man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence,\nI cannot, even in memory, dwell on it without a start of horror.\nI will say but one thing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring\nyour mind to credit it) will be more than enough. The creature\nwho crept into my house that night was, on Jekyll’s own\nconfession, known by the name of Hyde and hunted for in every\ncorner of the land as the murderer of Carew.\nHastie Lanyon.",
