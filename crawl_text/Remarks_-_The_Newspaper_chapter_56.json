        "An Address Delivered Before the Wisconsin State Press Association, at\nWhite-Water, Wis., August 11, 1886.",
        "Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Press of Wisconsin:",
        "I am sure that when you so kindly invited me to address you to-day, you\ndid not anticipate a lavish display of genius and gestures. I accepted the\ninvitation because it afforded me an opportunity to meet you and to get\nacquainted with you, and tell you personally that for years I have been a\nconstant reader of your valuable paper and I like it. You are running it\njust as I like to see a newspaper run.",
        "I need not elaborate upon the wonderful growth of the press in our\ncountry, or refer to the great power which journalism wields in the\ndevelopment of the new world. I need not ladle out statistics to show you\nhow the newspaper has encroached upon the field of oratory and how the\npale and silent man, while others sleep, compiles the universal history of\na day and tells his mighty audience what he thinks about it before he goes\nto bed.",
        "Of course, this is but the opinion of one man, but who has a better\nopportunity to judge than he who sits with his finger on the electric\npulse of the world, judging the actions of humanity at so much per judge,\ninvariably in advance?",
        "I need not tell you all this, for you certainly know it if you read your\npaper, and I hope you do. A man ought to read his own paper, even if he\ncannot endorse all its sentiments.",
        "So necessary has the profession of journalism become to the progress and\neducation of our country, that the matter of establishing schools where\nyoung men may be fitted for an active newspaper life, has attracted much\nattention and discussion. It has been demonstrated that our colleges do\nnot fit a young man to walk at once into the active management of a paper.\nHe should at least know the difference between a vile contemporary and a\nGothic scoop.",
        "It is difficult to map out a proper course for the student in a school of\njournalism, there are so many things connected with the profession which\nthe editor and his staff should know and know hard. The newspaper of\nto-day is a library. It is an encyclopaedia, a poem, a biography, a\nhistory, a prophecy, a directory, a time-table, a romance, a cook book, a\nguide, a horoscope, an art critic, a political resume, a multum in\nparvo. It is a sermon, a song, a circus, an obituary, a picnic, a\nshipwreck, a symphony in solid brevier, a medley of life and death, a\ngrand aggregation of man’s glory and his shame. It is, in short, a\nbird’s-eye-view of all the magnanimity and meanness, the joys and griefs,\nthe births and deaths, the pride and poverty of the world, and all for two\ncents–sometimes.",
        "I could tell you some more things that the newspaper of to-day is, if you\nhad time to stay here and your business would not suffer in your absence.\nAmong others it is a long felt want, a nine-column paper in a five-column\ntown, a lying sheet, a feeble effort, a financial problem, a tottering\nwreck, a political tool and a sheriff’s sale.",
        "If I were to suggest a curriculum for the young man who wished to take a\nregular course in a school of journalism, preferring that to the actual\nexperience, I would say to him, devote the first two years to meditation\nand prayer. This will prepare the young editor for the surprise and\nconsequent temptation to profanity which in a few years he may experience\nwhen he finds that the name of the Deity in his double-leaded editorial is\nspelled with a little “g,” and the peroration of the article is locked up\nbetween a death notice and the advertisement of a patent moustache coaxer,\nwhich is to follow pure reading matter every day in the week and occupy\nthe top of column on Sunday tf.",
        "The ensuing five years should be devoted to the peculiar orthography of\nthe English language.",
        "Then put in three years with the dumb bells, sand bags, slung shots and\ntomahawk. In my own journalistic experience I have found more cause for\nregret over my neglect of this branch than anything else. I usually keep\non my desk during a heated campaign, a large paper weight, weighing three\nor four pounds, and in several instances I have found that I could feed\nthat to a constant reader of my valuable paper instead of a retraction.",
        "Fewer people lick the editor though, now, than did so in years gone by.\nMany people–in the last two years–have gone across the street to lick\nthe editor and never returned. They intended to come right back in a few\nmoments, but they are now in a land where a change of heart and a palm\nleaf fan is all they need.",
        "Fewer people are robbing the editor now-a-days, too, I notice with much\npleasure. Only a short time ago I noticed that a burglar succeeded in\nbreaking into the residence of a Dakota journalist, and after a long, hard\nstruggle the editor succeeded in robbing him.",
        "After the primary course, mapped out already, an intermediate course of\nten years should be given to learning the typographical art, so that when\nvisitors come in and ask the editor all about the office, he can tell them\nof the mysteries of making a paper, and how delinquent subscribers have\nfrequently been killed by a well-directed blow with a printer’s towel.",
        "Five years should be devoted to a study of the art of proof-reading. In\nthat length of time the young journalist can perfect himself to such a\ndegree that it will take another five years for the printer to understand\nhis corrections and marginal notes.",
        "Fifteen years should then be devoted to the study of American politics,\nespecially civil service reform, looking at it from a non-partisan\nstandpoint. If possible, the last five years should be spent abroad.\nLondon is the place to go if you wish to get a clear, concise view of\nAmerican politics, and Chicago or Milwaukee would be a good place for the\nyoung English journalist to go and study the political outlook of England.",
        "The student should then take a medical and surgical course, so that he\nmay be able to attend to contusions, fractures and so forth, which may\noccur to himself or to the party who may come to his office for a\nretraction and by mistake get his spinal column double-leaded.",
        "Ten years should then be given to the study of law. No thorough,\nmetropolitan editor wants to enter upon the duties of his profession\nwithout knowing the difference between a writ of mandamus and other\nstyles of profanity. He should thoroughly understand the entire system of\nAmerican jurisprudence, so that in case a certiorari should break out in\nhis neighborhood he would know just what to do for it.",
        "The student will, by this time, begin to see what is required of him and\nenter with great zeal upon the further study of his profession.",
        "He will now enter upon a theological course of ten years and fit himself\nthoroughly to speak intelligently of the various creeds and religions of\nthe world. Ignorance or the part of an editor is almost a crime, and when\nhe closes a powerful editorial with the familiar quotation, “It is the\nearly bird that catches the worm,” and attributes it to St. Paul instead\nof Deuteronomy, it makes me blush for the profession.",
        "The last ten years may be profitably devoted to the acquisition of a\npractical knowledge of cutting cordwood, baking beans, making shirts,\nlecturing, turning double handsprings, being shot out of a catapult at a\ncircus, learning how to make a good adhesive paste that will not sour in\nhot weather, grinding scissors, punctuating, capitalization, condemnation,\nsyntax, plain sewing, music and dancing, sculpting, etiquette, prosody, how\nto win the affections of the opposite sex and evade a malignant case of\nbreach of promise, the ten commandments, every man his own tooter on the\nflute, croquet, rules of the prize ring, rhetoric, parlor magic,\ncalisthenics, penmanship, how to run a jack from the bottom of the pack\nwithout getting shot, civil engineering, decorative art, kalsomining,\nbicycling, base ball, hydraulics, botany, poker, international law,\nhigh-low-jack, drawing and painting, faro, vocal music, driving, breaking\nteam, fifteen ball pool, how to remove grease spots from last year’s\npantaloons, horsemanship, coupling freight cars, riding on a rail, riding\non a pass, feeding threshing machines, how to wean a calf from the parent\nstem, teaching school, bull-whacking, plastering, waltzing, vaccination,\nautopsy, how to win the affections of your wife’s mother, every man his\nown washerwoman, or how to wash underclothes so they will not shrink,\netc., etc.",
        "But time forbids anything like a thorough list of what a young man should\nstudy in order to fully understand all that he may be called upon to\nexpress an opinion about in his actual experience as a journalist. There\nare a thousand little matters which every editor should know; such, for\ninstance, as the construction of roller composition. Many newspaper men\ncan write a good editorial on Asiatic cholera, but their roller\ncomposition is not fit to eat.",
        "With the course of study that I have mapped out, the young student would\nemerge from the college of journalism at the age of 95 or 96, ready to\ntake off his coat and write an article on almost any subject. He would be\na little giddy at first, and the office boy would have to see that he went\nto bed at a proper time each night, but aside from that, he would be a\ngood man to feed a waste paper basket.",
        "Actual experience is the best teacher in this peculiarly trying\nprofession. I hope some day to attend a press convention where the order\nof exercise will consist of five-minute experiences from each one present\nIt would be worth listening to.",
        "My own experience was a little peculiar. It was my intention at first to\npractice law, when I went to the Rocky Mountains, although I had been\nwarned by the authorities not to do so. Still, I did practice in a\nsurreptitious kind of a way, and might have been practicing yet if my\nclient hadn’t died. When you have become attached to a client and respect\nand like him, and then when, without warning, like a bolt of electricity\nfrom a clear sky, he suddenly dies and takes the bread right out of your\nmouth, it is rough.",
        "Then I tried the practice of criminal law, but my client got into the\npenitentiary, where he was no use to me financially or politically.\nFinally, when the judge was in a hurry, he would appoint me to defend the\npauper criminals. They all went to the penitentiary, until people got to\ncriticising the judge, and finally they told him that it was a shame to\nappoint me to defend an innocent man.",
        "My first experience in journalism was in a Western town, in which I was a\ntotal stranger. I went there with thirty-five cents, but I had it\nconcealed in the lining of my clothes so that no one would have suspected\nit if they had met me. I had no friends, and I noticed that when I got off\nthe train the band was not there to meet me. I entered the town just as\nany other American citizen would. I had not fully decided whether to\nbecome a stage robber or a lecturer on phrenology. At that time I got a\nchance to work on a morning paper. It used to go to press before dark, so\nI always had my evenings to myself and I liked that part of it first-rate.\nI worked on that paper a year and might have continued if the proprietors\nhad not changed it to an evening paper.",
        "Then a company incorporated itself and started a paper, of which I took\ncharge. The paper was published in the loft of a livery stable. That is\nthe reason they called it a stock company. You could come up the stairs\ninto the office or you could twist the tail of the iron-gray mule and take\nthe elevator.",
        "It wasn’t much of a paper, but it cost $16,000 a year to run it, and it\ncame out six days in the week, no matter what the weather was. We took the\nAssociated Press news by telegraph part of the time and part of the time\nwe relied on the Cheyenne morning papers, which we got of the conductor on\nthe early morning freight. We got a great many special telegrams from\nWashington in that way, and when the freight train got in late, I had to\nguess at what congress was doing and fix up a column of telegraph the best\nI could. There was a rival evening paper there, and sometimes it would\nsend a smart boy down to the train and get hold of our special telegrams,\nand sometimes the conductor would go away on a picnic and take our\nCheyenne paper with him.",
        "All these things are annoying to a man who is trying to supply a long felt\nwant. There was one conductor, in particular, who used to go away into the\nfoot-hills shooting sage hens and take our cablegrams with him. This threw\ntoo much strain on me. I could guess at what congress was doing and make\nup a pretty readable report, but foreign powers and reichstags and crowned\nheads and dynasties always mixed me up. You can look over what congress\ndid last year and give a pretty good guess at what it will do this year,\nbut you can’t rely on a dynasty or an effete monarchy in a bad state of\npreservation. It may go into executive session or it may go into\nbankruptcy.",
        "Still, at one time we used to have considerable local news to fill up\nwith. The north and middle parks for a while used to help us out when the\nmining camps were new. Those were the days when it was considered\nperfectly proper to kill off the board of supervisors if their action was\ndistasteful. At that time a new camp generally located a cemetery and\nwrote an obituary; then the boys would start out to find a man whose name\nwould rhyme with the rest of the verse. Those were the days when the\ncemeteries of Colorado were still in their infancy and the song of the\nsix-shooter was heard in the land.",
        "Sometimes the Indians would send us in an item. It was generally in the\nobituary line. With the Sioux on the north and the peaceful Utes on the\nsouth, we were pretty sure of some kind of news during the summer. The\nparks used to be occupied by white men winters and Indians summers. Summer\nwas really the pleasantest time to go into the parks, but the Indians had\nbeen in the habit of going there at that season, and they were so clannish\nthat the white men couldn’t have much fun with them, so they decided they\nwould not go there in the summer. Several of our best subscribers were\nkilled by the peaceful Utes.",
        "There were two daily and three weekly papers published in Laramie City av\nthat time. There were between two and three thousand people and our local\ncirculation ran from 150 to 250, counting dead-heads. In our prospectus we\nstated that we would spare no expense whatever in ransacking the universe\nfor fresh news, but there were times when it was all we could do to get\nour paper out on time. Out of the express office, I mean.",
        "One of the rival editors used to write his editorials for the paper in the\nevening, jerk the Washington hand-press to work them off, go home and\nwrestle with juvenile colic in his family until daylight and then deliver\nhis papers on the street. It is not surprising that the great mental\nstrain incident to this life made an old man of him, and gave a tinge of\nextreme sadness to the funny column of his paper.",
        "In an unguarded moment, this man wrote an editorial once that got all his\nsubscribers mad at him, and the same afternoon he came around and wanted\nto sell his paper to us for $10,000. I told him that the whole outfit\nwasn’t worth ten thousand cents.",
        "“I know that,” said he, “but it is not the material that I am talking\nabout. It is the good will of the paper.”",
        "We had a rising young horsethief in Wyoming in those days, who got into\njail by some freak of justice, and it was so odd for a horsethief to get\ninto jail that I alluded to it editorially. This horsethief had\ndistinguished himself from the common, vulgar horsethieves of his time, by\nwearing a large mouth–a kind of full-dress, eight-day mouth. He rarely\nsmiled, but when he did, he had to hold the top of his head on with both\nhands. I remember that I spoke of this in the paper, forgetting that he\nmight criticise me when he got out of jail. When he did get out again, he\nstated that he would shoot me on sight, but friends advised me not to have\nhis blood on my hands, and I took their advice, so I haven’t got a\nparticle of his blood on either of my hands.",
        "For two or three months I didn’t know but he would drop into the office\nany minute and criticise me, but one day a friend told me that he had been\nhung in Montana. Then I began to mingle in society again, and didn’t have\nto get in my coal with a double barrel shot gun any more.",
        "After that I was always conservative in relation to horsethieves until we\ngot the report of the vigilance committee.",
        "Wrestling with the Mazy.",
        "Very soon now I shall be strong enough on my cyclone leg to resume my\nlessons in waltzing. It is needless to say that I look forward with great\npleasure to that moment. Nature intended that I should glide in the mazy.\nTall, lithe, bald-headed, genial, limber in the extreme, suave, soulful,\nfrolicsome at times, yet dignified and reserved toward strangers, light on\nthe foot–on my own foot, I mean–gentle as a woman at times, yet\nirresistible as a tornado when insulted by a smaller, I am peculiarly\nfitted to shine in society. Those who have observed my polished brow, when\nunder a strong electric light, say they never saw a man shine so in\nsociety as I do.",
        "My wife taught me how to waltz. She would teach me on Saturdays and repair\nher skirts during the following week. I told her once that I thought I was\ntoo brainy to dance. She said she hadn’t noticed that, but she thought I\nseemed to run too much to legs. My wife is not timid about telling me\nanything that she thinks will be for my good. When I make a mistake she is\nperfectly frank with me, and comes right to me and tells me about it, so\nthat I won’t do so again.",
        "I had just learned how to reel around a ballroom to a little waltz music,\nwhen I was blown across the State of Mississippi in September last by a\nhigh wind, and broke one of my legs which I use in waltzing. When this\naccident occurred I had just got where I felt at liberty to choose a\nglorious being with starry eyes and fluffy hair, and magnificently modeled\nform, to steer me around the rink to the dreamy music of Strauss. One\nyoung lady, with whom I had waltzed a good deal, when she heard that my\nleg was broken, began to attend every dancing party she could hear of,\nalthough she had declined a great many previous to that. I asked her how\nshe could be so giddy and so gay when I was suffering. She said she was\ndoing it to drown her sorrow, but her little brother told me on the quiet\nthat she was dancing while I was sick because she felt perfectly safe. A\nfriend of mine says I have a pronounced and distinctly original manner of\nwaltzing, and that he never saw anybody, with one exception, who waltzed\nas I did, and that was Jumbo. He claimed that either one of us would be a\ngood dancer if he could have the whole ring to himself. He said that he\nwould like to see Jumbo and me waltz together if he were not afraid that I\nwould step on Jumbo and hurt him. You can see what a feeling of jealous\nhatred it arouses in some small minds when a man gets so that he can\nmingle in good society and enjoy himself.",
        "I could waltz more easily if the rules did not require such a constant\nchange of position. I am sedentary in my nature, slow to move about, so\nthat it takes a lady of great strength of purpose to pull me around on\ntime.",
