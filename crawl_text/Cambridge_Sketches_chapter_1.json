        "It has never been my practice to introduce myself to distinguished\npersons, or to attempt in any way to attract their attention, and I now\nregret that I did not embrace some opportunities which occurred to me in\nearly life for doing so; but at the time I knew the men whom I have\ndescribed in the present volume I had no expectation that I should ever\nwrite about them. My acquaintance with them, however, has served to give\nme a more elevated idea of human nature than I otherwise might have\nacquired in the ordinary course of mundane affairs, and it is with the\nhope of transmitting this impression to my readers that I publish the\npresent account. Some of them have a world-wide celebrity, and others who\nwere distinguished in their own time seem likely now to be forgotten; but\nthey all deserve well of the republic of humanity and of the age in which\nthey lived.",
