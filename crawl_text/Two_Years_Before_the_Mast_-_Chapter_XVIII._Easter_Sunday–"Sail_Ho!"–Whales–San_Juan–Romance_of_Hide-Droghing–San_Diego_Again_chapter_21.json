        "The next Sunday was Easter Sunday, and as there had been no\nliberty at San Pedro, it was our turn to go ashore and misspend\nanother Sabbath.  Soon after breakfast, a large boat, filled with\nmen in blue jackets, scarlet caps, and various colored under-clothes,\nbound ashore on liberty, left the Italian ship, and passed under\nour stern; the men singing beautiful Italian boat-songs, all the way,\nin fine, full chorus.  Among the songs I recognized the favorite\n“O Pescator dell’ onda.”  It brought back to my mind pianofortes,\ndrawing-rooms, young ladies singing, and a thousand other things\nwhich as little befitted me, in my situation, to be thinking upon.\nSupposing that the whole day would be too long a time to spend\nashore, as there was no place to which we could take a ride,\nwe remained quietly on board until after dinner.  We were then\npulled ashore in the stern of the boat, and, with orders to be on\nthe beach at sundown, we took our way for the town.  There,\neverything wore the appearance of a holyday.  The people were\nall dressed in their best; the men riding about on horseback among\nthe houses, and the women sitting on carpets before the doors.\nUnder the piazza of a “pulperia,” two men were seated, decked out\nwith knots of ribbons and bouquets, and playing the violin and\nthe Spanish guitar.  These are the only instruments, with the\nexception of the drums and trumpets at Monterey that I ever heard in\nCalifornia; and I suspect they play upon no others, for at a great\nfandango at which I was afterwards present, and where they mustered\nall the music they could find, there were three violins and two\nguitars, and no other instrument.  As it was now too near the middle\nof the day to see any dancing and hearing that a bull was expected\ndown from the country, to be baited in the presidio square, in the\ncourse of an hour or two we took a stroll among the houses.\nInquiring for an American who, we had been told, had married in the\nplace, and kept a shop, we were directed to a long, low building,\nat the end of which was a door, with a sign over it, in Spanish.\nEntering the shop, we found no one in it, and the whole had an\nempty, deserted appearance.  In a few minutes the man made his\nappearance, and apologized for having nothing to entertain us with,\nsaying that he had had a fandango at his house the night before,\nand the people had eaten and drunk up everything.",
        "“Oh yes!” said I, “Easter holydays?”",
        "“No!” said he, with a singular expression to his face; “I had a\nlittle daughter die the other day, and that’s the custom of the\ncountry.”",
        "Here I felt a little strangely, not knowing what to say, or whether\nto offer consolation or no, and was beginning to retire, when he\nopened a side door and told us to walk in.  Here I was no less\nastonished; for I found a large room, filled with young girls,\nfrom three or four years of age up to fifteen and sixteen, dressed\nall in white, with wreaths of flowers on their heads, and bouquets\nin their hands.  Following our conductor through all these girls,\nwho were playing about in high spirits, we came to a table, at the\nend of the room, covered with a white cloth, on which lay a coffin,\nabout three feet long, with the body of his child.  The coffin was\nlined on the outside with white cloth, and on the inside with white\nsatin, and was strewed with flowers.  Through an open door we saw,\nin another room, a few elderly people in common dresses; while\nthe benches and tables thrown up in a corner, and the stained walls,\ngave evident signs of the last night’s “high go.”  Feeling, like\nGarrick, between tragedy and comedy, an uncertainty of purpose\nand a little awkwardness, I asked the man when the funeral would\ntake place, and being told that it would move toward the mission\nin about an hour, took my leave.",
        "To pass away the time, we took horses and rode down to the\nbeach, and there found three or four Italian sailors, mounted, and\nriding up and down, on the hard sand, at a furious rate.  We joined\nthem, and found it fine sport.  The beach gave us a stretch of a mile\nor more, and the horses flew over the smooth, hard sand, apparently\ninvigorated and excited by the salt sea-breeze, and by the continual\nroar and dashing of the breakers.  From the beach we returned to\nthe town, and finding that the funeral procession had moved, rode\non and overtook it, about half-way to the mission.  Here was as\npeculiar a sight as we had seen before in the house; the one looking\nas much like a funeral procession as the other did like a house of\nmourning.  The little coffin was borne by eight girls, who were\ncontinually relieved by others, running forward from the procession\nand taking their places.  Behind it came a straggling company of\ngirls, dressed as before, in white and flowers, and including, I should\nsuppose by their numbers, nearly all the girls between five and fifteen\nin the place.  They played along on the way, frequently stopping\nand running all together to talk to some one, or to pick up a flower,\nand then running on again to overtake the coffin.  There were a few\nelderly women in common colors; and a herd of young men and boys,\nsome on foot and others mounted, followed them, or walked or rode\nby their side, frequently interrupting them by jokes and questions.\nBut the most singular thing of all was, that two men walked,\none on each side of the coffin, carrying muskets in their hands,\nwhich they continually loaded, and fired into the air.  Whether\nthis was to keep off the evil spirits or not, I do not know.\nIt was the only interpretation that I could put upon it.",
        "As we drew near the mission, we saw the great gate thrown open,\nand the pádre standing on the steps, with a crucifix in hand.\nThe mission is a large and deserted-looking place, the out-buildings\ngoing to ruin, and everything giving one the impression of decayed\ngrandeur.  A large stone fountain threw out pure water, from four\nmouths, into a basin, before the church door; and we were on the\npoint of riding up to let our horses drink, when it occurred to us\nthat it might be consecrated, and we forbore.  Just at this moment,\nthe bells set up their harsh, discordant clang; and the procession\nmoved into the court.  I was anxious to follow, and see the ceremony,\nbut the horse of one of my companions had become frightened, and\nwas tearing off toward the town; and having thrown his rider, and\ngot one of his feet caught in the saddle, which had slipped, was fast\ndragging and ripping it to pieces.  Knowing that my shipmate\ncould not speak a word of Spanish, and fearing that he would get\ninto difficulty, I was obliged to leave the ceremony and ride after\nhim.  I soon overtook him, trudging along, swearing at the horse,\nand carrying the remains of the saddle, which he had picked up\non the road.  Going to the owner of the horse, we made a settlement\nwith him, and found him surprisingly liberal.  All parts of\nthe saddle were brought back, and, being capable of repair, he was\nsatisfied with six reáls.  We thought it would have been a few\ndollars.  We pointed to the horse, which was now half way up one\nof the mountains; but he shook his head, saying, “No importe!\"\nand giving us to understand that he had plenty more.",
        "Having returned to the town, we saw a great crowd collected in\nthe square before the principal pulperia, and riding up, found that\nall these people–men, women, and children–had been drawn together\nby a couple of bantam cocks.  The cocks were in full tilt,\nspringing into one another, and the people were as eager, laughing\nand shouting, as though the combatants had been men.  There had\nbeen a disappointment about the bull; he had broken his bail, and\ntaken himself off, and it was too late to get another; so the people\nwere obliged to put up with a cock-fight.  One of the bantams having\nbeen knocked in the head, and had an eye put out, he gave in, and\ntwo monstrous prize-cocks were brought on.  These were the object\nof the whole affair; the two bantams having been merely served up\nas a first course, to collect the people together.  Two fellows came\ninto the ring holding the cocks in their arms, and stroking them,\nand running about on all fours, encouraging and setting them on.\nBets ran high, and, like most other contests, it remained for some\ntime undecided.  They both showed great pluck, and fought probably\nbetter and longer than their masters would have done.  Whether,\nin the end, it was the white or the red that beat, I do not recollect;\nbut, whichever it was, he strutted off with the true veni-vidi-vici look,\nleaving the other lying panting on his beam-ends.",
        "This matter having been settled, we heard some talk about “caballos\"\nand “carrera” and seeing the people all streaming off in one direction,\nwe followed, and came upon a level piece of ground, just out of\nthe town, which was used as a race-course.  Here the crowd soon\nbecame thick again; the ground was marked off; the judges stationed;\nand the horses led up to one end.  Two fine-looking old gentlemen\n–Don Carlos and Don Domingo, so called–held the stakes, and all\nwas now ready.  We waited some time, during which we could just see\nthe horses twisting round and turning, until, at length, there\nwas a shout along the lines, and on they came–heads stretched\nout and eyes starting;–working all over, both man and beast.\nThe steeds came by us like a couple of chain-shot–neck and neck;\nand now we could see nothing but their backs, and their hind hoofs\nflying in the air.  As fast as the horses passed, the crowd broke\nup behind them, and ran to the goal.  When we got there, we found\nthe horses returning on a slow walk, having run far beyond the mark,\nand heard that the long, bony one had come in head and shoulders\nbefore the other.  The riders were light-built men; had handkerchiefs\ntied round their heads; and were bare-armed and bare-legged.\nThe horses were noble-looking beasts, not so sleek and combed as\nour Boston stable-horses, but with fine limbs, and spirited eyes.\nAfter this had been settled, and fully talked over, the crowd\nscattered again and flocked back to the town.",
        "Returning to the large pulperia, we found the violin and guitar\nscreaming and twanging away under the piazza, where they had\nbeen all day.  As it was now sundown, there began to be some\ndancing.  The Italian sailors danced, and one of our crew exhibited\nhimself in a sort of West India shuffle, much to the amusement of\nthe bystanders, who cried out, “Bravo!” “Otra vez!” and “Vivan\nlos marineros!” but the dancing did not become general, as the\nwomen and the “gente de razón” had not yet made their appearance.\nWe wished very much to stay and see the style of dancing; but,\nalthough we had had our own way during the day, yet we were,\nafter all, but ’foremast Jacks; and having been ordered to be on the\nbeach by sundown, did not venture to be more than an hour behind\nthe time; so we took our way down.  We found the boat just pulling\nashore through the breakers, which were running high, there having\nbeen a heavy fog outside, which, from some cause or other, always\nbrings on, or precedes a heavy sea.  Liberty-men are privileged\nfrom the time they leave the vessel until they step on board again;\nso we took our places in the stern sheets, and were congratulating\nourselves upon getting off dry, when a great comber broke fore and\naft the boat, and wet us through and through, filling the boat\nhalf full of water.  Having lost her buoyancy by the weight of the\nwater, she dropped heavily into every sea that struck her, and by\nthe time we had pulled out of the surf into deep water, she was but\njust afloat, and we were up to our knees.  By the help of a small\nbucket and our hats, we bailed her out, got on board, hoisted the\nboats, eat our supper, changed our clothes, gave (as is usual) the\nwhole history of our day’s adventures to those who had staid on\nboard, and having taken a night-smoke, turned-in.  Thus ended\nour second day’s liberty on shore.",
        "On Monday morning, as an offset to our day’s sport, we were all\nset to work “tarring down” the rigging.  Some got girt-lines up\nfor riding down the stays and back-stays, and others tarred the\nshrouds, lifts, etc., laying out on the yards, and coming down\nthe rigging.  We overhauled our bags and took out our old tarry\ntrowsers and frocks, which we had used when we tarred down before,\nand were all at work in the rigging by sunrise.  After breakfast,\nwe had the satisfaction of seeing the Italian ship’s boat go ashore,\nfilled with men, gaily dressed, as on the day before, and singing\ntheir barcarollas.  The Easter holydays are kept up on shore during\nthree days; and being a Catholic vessel, the Crew had the advantage\nof them.  For two successive days, while perched up in the rigging,\ncovered with tar and engaged in our disagreeable work, we saw these\nfellows going ashore in the morning, and coming off again at night,\nin high spirits.  So much for being Protestants.  There’s no danger\nof Catholicism’s spreading in New England; Yankees can’t afford the\ntime to be Catholics.  American shipmasters get nearly three weeks\nmore labor out of their crews, in the course of a year, than the\nmasters of vessels from Catholic countries.  Yankees don’t keep\nChristmas, and ship-masters at sea never know when Thanksgiving\ncomes, so Jack has no festival at all.",
        "About noon, a man aloft called out “Sail ho!” and looking round,\nwe saw the head sails of a vessel coming round the point.  As she\ndrew round, she showed the broadside of a full-rigged brig, with\nthe Yankee ensign at her peak.  We ran up our stars and stripes, and,\nknowing that there was no American brig on the coast but ourselves,\nexpected to have news from home.  She rounded-to and let go her\nanchor, but the dark faces on her yards, when they furled the sails,\nand the Babel on deck, soon made known that she was from the Islands.\nImmediately afterwards, a boat’s crew came aboard, bringing her skipper,\nand from them we learned that she was from Oahu, and was engaged in\nthe same trade with the Ayacucho, Loriotte, etc., between the coast,\nthe Sandwich Islands, and the leeward coast of Peru and Chili.\nHer captain and officers were Americans, and also a part of her crew;\nthe rest were Islanders.  She was called the Catalina, and, like all\nthe others vessels in that trade, except the Ayacucho, her papers\nand colors were from Uncle Sam.  They, of course, brought us no news,\nand we were doubly disappointed, for we had thought, at first,\nit might be the ship which we were expecting from Boston.",
        "After lying here about a fortnight, and collecting all the hides the\nplace afforded, we set sail again for San Pedro.  There we found\nthe brig which we had assisted in getting off lying at anchor,\nwith a mixed crew of Americans, English, Sandwich Islanders,\nSpaniards, and Spanish Indians; and, though much smaller than we,\nyet she had three times the number of men; and she needed them,\nfor her officers were Californians.  No vessels in the world\ngo so poorly manned as American and English; and none do so well.\nA Yankee brig of that size would have had a crew of four men,\nand would have worked round and round her.  The Italian ship had a\ncrew of thirty men; nearly three times as many as the Alert, which\nwas afterwards on the coast, and was of the same size; yet the Alert\nwould get under weigh and come-to in half the time, and get two\nanchors, while they were all talking at once–jabbering like a parcel\nof “Yahoos,” and running about decks to find their cat-block.",
        "There was only one point in which they had the advantage over us,\nand that was in lightening their labors in the boats by their songs.\nThe Americans are a time and money saving people, but have not yet,\nas a nation, learned that music may be “turned to account.”  We pulled\nthe long distances to and from the shore, with our loaded boats,\nwithout a word spoken, and with discontented looks, while they not\nonly lightened the labor of rowing, but actually made it pleasant\nand cheerful, by their music.  So true is it, that–",
        "“For the tired slave, song lifts the languid oar,\n  And bids it aptly fall, with chime\nThat beautifies the fairest shore,\n  And mitigates the harshest clime.”",
        "We lay about a week in San Pedro, and got under weigh for San Diego,\nintending to stop at San Juan, as the south-easter season was\nnearly over, and there was little or no danger.",
        "This being the spring season, San Pedro, as well as all the other\nopen ports upon the coast, was filled with whales, that had come in\nto make their annual visit upon soundings.  For the first few days\nthat we were here and at Santa Barbara, we watched them with\ngreat interest–calling out “there she blows!” every time we saw the\nspout of one breaking the surface of the water; but they soon became\nso common that we took little notice of them.  They often “broke\"\nvery near us; and one thick, foggy night, during a dead calm, while\nI was standing anchor-watch, one of them rose so near, that he\nstruck our cable, and made all surge again.  He did not seem to like\nthe encounter much himself, for he sheered off, and spouted at a\ngood distance.  We once came very near running one down in the\ngig, and should probably have been knocked to pieces and blown\nsky-high.  We had been on board the little Spanish brig, and were\nreturning, stretching out well at our oars, the little boat going like a\nswallow; our backs were forward, (as is always the case in pulling,)\nand the captain, who was steering, was not looking ahead, when, all\nat once, we heard the spout of a whale directly ahead.  “Back water!\nback water, for your lives!” shouted the captain; and we backed\nour blades in the water and brought the boat to in a smother of\nfoam.  Turning our heads, we saw a great, rough, hump-backed whale,\nslowly crossing our fore foot, within three or four yards of the\nboat’s stem.  Had we not backed water just as we did, we should\ninevitably have gone smash upon him, striking him with our stem\njust about amidships.  He took no notice of us, but passed slowly on,\nand dived a few yards beyond us, throwing his tail high in the air.\nHe was so near that we had a perfect view of him and as may be\nsupposed, had no desire to see him nearer.  He was a disgusting\ncreature; with a skin rough, hairy, and of an iron-grey color.\nThis kind differs much from the sperm, in color and skin, and is said\nto be fiercer.  We saw a few sperm whales; but most of the whales\nthat come upon the coast are fin-backs, hump-backs, and right-whales,\nwhich are more difficult to take, and are said not to give oil\nenough to pay for the trouble.  For this reason whale-ships do not\ncome upon the coast after them.  Our captain, together with Captain\nNye of the Loriotte, who had been in a whale-ship, thought of\nmaking an attempt upon one of them with two boats’ crews, but\nas we had only two harpoons and no proper lines, they gave it up.",
        "During the months of March, April, and May, these whales appear in\ngreat numbers in the open ports of Santa Barbara, San Pedro, etc.,\nand hover off the coast, while a few find their way into the\nclose harbors of San Diego and Monterey.  They are all off again\nbefore midsummer, and make their appearance on the “off-shore\nground.”  We saw some fine “schools” of sperm whales, which are\neasily distinguished by their spout, blowing away, a few miles to\nwindward, on our passage to San Juan.",
        "Coasting along on the quiet shore of the Pacific, we came to anchor,\nin twenty fathoms’ water, almost out at sea, as it were, and directly\nabreast of a steep hill which overhung the water, and was twice as\nhigh as our royal-mast-head.  We had heard much of this place, from\nthe Lagoda’s crew, who said it was the worst place in California.\nThe shore is rocky, and directly exposed to the south-east, so that\nvessels are obliged to slip and run for their lives on the first\nsign of a gale; and late as it was in the season, we got up our\nslip-rope and gear, though we meant to stay only twenty-four hours.\nWe pulled the agent ashore, and were ordered to wait for him,\nwhile he took a circuitous way round the hill to the mission,\nwhich was hidden behind it.  We were glad of the opportunity to\nexamine this singular place, and hauling the boat up and making\nher well fast, took different directions up and down the beach,\nto explore it.",
        "San Juan is the only romantic spot in California.  The country\nhere for several miles is high table-land, running boldly to the shore,\nand breaking off in a steep hill, at the foot of which the waters of the\nPacific are constantly dashing.  For several miles the water washes\nthe very base of the hill, or breaks upon ledges and fragments of\nrocks which run out into the sea.  Just where we landed was a small\ncove, or “bight,” which gave us, at high tide, a few square feet of\nsand-beach between the sea and the bottom of the hill.  This was\nthe only landing-place.  Directly before us, rose the perpendicular\nheight of four or five hundred feet.  How we were to get hides down,\nor goods up, upon the table-land on which the mission was situated,\nwas more than we could tell.  The agent had taken a long circuit,\nand yet had frequently to jump over breaks, and climb up steep\nplaces, in the ascent.  No animal but a man or monkey could get up\nit.  However, that was not our look-out; and knowing that the agent\nwould be gone an hour or more, we strolled about, picking up shells,\nand following the sea where it tumbled in, roaring and spouting,\namong the crevices of the great rocks.  What a sight, thought I, must\nthis be in a south-easter! The rocks were as large as those of Nahant\nor Newport, but, to my eye, more grand and broken.  Beside, there\nwas a grandeur in everything around, which gave almost a solemnity\nto the scene: a silence and solitariness which affected everything!\nNot a human being but ourselves for miles; and no sound heard but\nthe pulsations of the great Pacific! and the great steep hill rising\nlike a wall, and cutting us off from all the world, but the “world of\nwaters!”  I separated myself from the rest and sat down on a rock,\njust where the sea ran in and formed a fine spouting horn.\nCompared with the plain, dull sand-beach of the rest of the coast,\nthis grandeur was as refreshing as a great rock in a weary land.\nIt was almost the first time that I had been positively alone–free\nfrom the sense that human beings were at my elbow, if not talking\nwith me–since I had left home.  My better nature returned strong\nupon me.  Everything was in accordance with my state of feeling,\nand I experienced a glow of pleasure at finding that what of poetry\nand romance I ever had in me, had not been entirely deadened by the\nlaborious and frittering life I had led.  Nearly an hour did I sit,\nalmost lost in the luxury of this entire new scene of the play in\nwhich I had been so long acting, when I was aroused by the distant\nshouts of my companions, and saw that they were collecting together,\nas the agent had made his appearance, on his way back to our\nboat.",
        "We pulled aboard, and found the long-boat hoisted out, and nearly\nladen with goods; and after dinner, we all went on shore in the\nquarter-boat, with the long-boat in tow.  As we drew in, we found\nan ox-cart and a couple of men standing directly on the brow of the\nhill; and having landed, the captain took his way round the hill,\nordering me and one other to follow him.  We followed, picking our\nway out, and jumping and scrambling up, walking over briers and\nprickly pears, until we came to the top.  Here the country stretched\nout for miles as far as the eye could reach, on a level, table surface;\nand the only habitation in sight was the small white mission of San\nJuan Capistrano, with a few Indian huts about it, standing in a\nsmall hollow, about a mile from where we were.  Reaching the brow\nof the hill where the cart stood, we found several piles of hides,\nand Indians sitting round them.  One or two other carts were coming\nslowly on from the mission, and the captain told us to begin and\nthrow the hides down.  This, then, was the way they were to be got\ndown: thrown down, one at a time, a distance of four hundred\nfeet! This was doing the business on a great scale.  Standing on\nthe edge of the hill and looking down the perpendicular height,\nthe sailors,",
        "–\"That walk upon the beach,\nAppeared like mice; and our tall anchoring bark\nDiminished to her cock; her cock a buoy\nAlmost too small for sight.”",
        "Down this height we pitched the hides, throwing them as far out\ninto the air as we could; and as they were all large, stiff,\nand doubled, like the cover of a book, the wind took them, and they\nswayed and eddied about, plunging and rising in the air, like a kite\nwhen it has broken its string.  As it was now low tide, there was\nno danger of their falling into the water, and as fast as they came\nto ground, the men below picked them up, and taking them on their\nheads, walked off with them to the boat.  It was really a picturesque\nsight: the great height; the scaling of the hides; and the continual\nwalking to and fro of the men, who looked like mites, on the beach!\nThis was the romance of hide-droghing!",
        "Some of the hides lodged in cavities which were under the bank and\nout of our sight, being directly under us; but by sending others down\nin the same direction, we succeeded in dislodging them.  Had they\nremained there, the captain said he should have sent on board for\na couple of pairs of long halyards, and got some one to have gone\ndown for them.  It was said that one of the crew of an English brig\nwent down in the same way, a few years before.  We looked over,\nand thought it would not be a welcome task, especially for a few\npaltry hides; but no one knows what he can do until he is called\nupon; for, six months afterwards, I went down the same place by\na pair of top-gallant studding-sail halyards, to save a half a\ndozen hides which had lodged there.",
        "Having thrown them all down, we took our way back again,\nand found the boat loaded and ready to start.  We pulled off;\ntook the hides all aboard; hoisted in the boats; hove up our anchor;\nmade sail; and before sundown, were on our way to San Diego.",
        "Friday, May 8th, 1835.  Arrived at San Diego.  Here we found the\nlittle harbor deserted.  The Lagoda, Ayacucho, Loriotte, and all,\nhad left the coast, and we were nearly alone.  All the hide-houses\non the beach, but ours, were shut up, and the Sandwich Islanders,\na dozen or twenty in number, who had worked for the other vessels and\nbeen paid off when they sailed, were living on the beach, keeping up\na grand carnival.  A Russian discovery-ship which had been in this\nport a few years before, had built a large oven for baking bread,\nand went away, leaving it standing.  This, the Sandwich Islanders\ntook possession of, and had kept, ever since, undisturbed.  It was\nbig enough to hold six or eight men–that is, it was as large as\na ship’s forecastle; had a door at the side, and a vent-hole at\ntop.  They covered it with Oahu mats, for a carpet; stopped up the\nvent-hole in bad weather, and made it their head-quarters.  It was\nnow inhabited by as many as a dozen or twenty men, who lived there\nin complete idleness–drinking, playing cards, and carousing in\nevery way.  They bought a bullock once a week, which kept them\nin meat, and one of them went up to the town every day to get\nfruit, liquor, and provisions.  Besides this, they had bought\na cask of ship-bread, and a barrel of flour from the Lagoda,\nbefore she sailed.  There they lived, having a grand time,\nand caring for nobody.  Captain T––- was anxious to get\nthree or four of them to come on board the Pilgrim, as we were\nso much diminished in numbers; and went up to the oven and spent\nan hour or two trying to negotiate with them.  One of them,–a\nfinely built, active, strong and intelligent fellow,– who was\na sort of king among them, acted as spokesman.  He was called\nMannini,–or rather, out of compliment to his known importance\nand influence, Mr. Mannini–and was known all over California.\nThrough him, the captain offered them fifteen dollars a month,\nand one month’s pay in advance; but it was like throwing pearls\nbefore swine, or rather, carrying coals to Newcastle.  So long\nas they had money, they would not work for fifty dollars a month,\nand when their money was gone, they would work for ten.",
        "“What do you do here, Mr. Mannini?\"(1) said the captain.",
        "–––––––––––––––\n1. The letter i in the Sandwich Island language is sounded\n   like e in the English.\n–––––––––––––––",
        "“Oh, we play cards, get drunk, smoke–do anything we’re a mind to.”",
        "“Don’t you want to come aboard and work?”",
        "“Aole! aole make make makou i ka hana.  Now, got plenty money;\nno good, work.  Mamule, money pau–all gone.  Ah! very good, work!–\nmaikai, hana hana nui!”",
        "“But you’ll spend all your money in this way,” said the captain.",
        "“Aye! me know that.  By-’em-by money pau–all gone; then Kanaka work plenty.”",
        "This was a hopeless case, and the captain left them, to wait\npatiently until their money was gone.",
        "We discharged our hides and tallow, and in about a week were\nready to set sail again for the windward.  We unmoored, and got\neverything ready, when the captain made another attempt upon the\noven.  This time he had more regard to the “mollia tempora fandi,\"\nand succeeded very well.  He got Mr. Mannini in his interest, and\nas the shot was getting low in the locker, prevailed upon him and\nthree others to come on board with their chests and baggage, and\nsent a hasty summons to me and the boy to come ashore with our\nthings, and join the gang at the hide-house.
