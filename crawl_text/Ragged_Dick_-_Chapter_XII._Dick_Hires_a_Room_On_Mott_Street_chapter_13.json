        "Going out into the fresh air Dick felt the pangs of hunger. He\naccordingly went to a restaurant and got a substantial supper.\nPerhaps it was the new clothes he wore, which made him feel a\nlittle more aristocratic. At all events, instead of patronizing the\ncheap restaurant where he usually procured his meals, he went into\nthe refectory attached to Lovejoy’s Hotel, where the prices were\nhigher and the company more select. In his ordinary dress, Dick\nwould have been excluded, but now he had the appearance of a very\nrespectable, gentlemanly boy, whose presence would not discredit\nany establishment. His orders were therefore received with attention\nby the waiter and in due time a good supper was placed before him.",
        "“I wish I could come here every day,” thought Dick. “It seems kind\no’ nice and ’spectable, side of the other place. There’s a gent at\nthat other table that I’ve shined boots for more’n once. He don’t\nknow me in my new clothes. Guess he don’t know his boot-black\npatronizes the same establishment.”",
        "His supper over, Dick went up to the desk, and, presenting his\ncheck, tendered in payment his five-dollar bill, as if it were one\nof a large number which he possessed. Receiving back his change he\nwent out into the street.",
        "Two questions now arose: How should he spend the evening, and where\nshould he pass the night? Yesterday, with such a sum of money in his\npossession, he would have answered both questions readily. For the\nevening, he would have passed it at the Old Bowery, and gone to\nsleep in any out-of-the-way place that offered. But he had turned\nover a new leaf, or resolved to do so. He meant to save his money\nfor some useful purpose,–to aid his advancement in the world. So he\ncould not afford the theatre. Besides, with his new clothes, he was\nunwilling to pass the night out of doors.",
        "“I should spile ’em,” he thought, “and that wouldn’t pay.”",
        "So he determined to hunt up a room which he could occupy regularly,\nand consider as his own, where he could sleep nights, instead of\ndepending on boxes and old wagons for a chance shelter. This would\nbe the first step towards respectability, and Dick determined to\ntake it.",
        "He accordingly passed through the City Hall Park, and walked\nleisurely up Centre Street.",
        "He decided that it would hardly be advisable for him to seek\nlodgings in Fifth Avenue, although his present cash capital\nconsisted of nearly five dollars in money, besides the valuable\npapers contained in his wallet. Besides, he had reason to doubt\nwhether any in his line of business lived on that aristocratic\nstreet. He took his way to Mott Street, which is considerably less\npretentious, and halted in front of a shabby brick lodging-house\nkept by a Mrs. Mooney, with whose son Tom, Dick was acquainted.",
        "Dick rang the bell, which sent back a shrill metallic response.",
        "The door was opened by a slatternly servant, who looked at him\ninquiringly, and not without curiosity. It must be remembered that\nDick was well dressed, and that nothing in his appearance bespoke\nhis occupation. Being naturally a good-looking boy, he might readily\nbe mistaken for a gentleman’s son.",
        "“Well, Queen Victoria,” said Dick, “is your missus at home?”",
        "“My name’s Bridget,” said the girl.",
        "“Oh, indeed!” said Dick. “You looked so much like the queen’s picter\nwhat she gave me last Christmas in exchange for mine, that I\ncouldn’t help calling you by her name.”",
        "“Oh, go along wid ye!” said Bridget. “It’s makin’ fun ye are.”",
        "“If you don’t believe me,” said Dick, gravely, “all you’ve got to do\nis to ask my partic’lar friend, the Duke of Newcastle.”",
        "“Bridget!” called a shrill voice from the basement.",
        "“The missus is calling me,” said Bridget, hurriedly. “I’ll tell her\nye want her.”",
        "“All right!” said Dick.",
        "The servant descended into the lower regions, and in a short time a\nstout, red-faced woman appeared on the scene.",
        "“Well, sir, what’s your wish?” she asked.",
        "“Have you got a room to let?” asked Dick.",
        "“Is it for yourself you ask?” questioned the woman, in some surprise.",
        "Dick answered in the affirmative.",
        "“I haven’t got any very good rooms vacant. There’s a small room in\nthe third story.”",
        "“I’d like to see it,” said Dick.",
        "“I don’t know as it would be good enough for you,” said the woman,\nwith a glance at Dick’s clothes.",
        "“I aint very partic’lar about accommodations,” said our hero. “I\nguess I’ll look at it.”",
        "Dick followed the landlady up two narrow stair-cases, uncarpeted\nand dirty, to the third landing, where he was ushered into a room\nabout ten feet square. It could not be considered a very desirable\napartment. It had once been covered with an oilcloth carpet, but\nthis was now very ragged, and looked worse than none. There was a\nsingle bed in the corner, covered with an indiscriminate heap of\nbed-clothing, rumpled and not over-clean. There was a bureau, with\nthe veneering scratched and in some parts stripped off, and a small\nglass, eight inches by ten, cracked across the middle; also two\nchairs in rather a disjointed condition. Judging from Dick’s\nappearance, Mrs. Mooney thought he would turn from it in disdain.",
        "But it must be remembered that Dick’s past experience had not been\nof a character to make him fastidious. In comparison with a box, or\nan empty wagon, even this little room seemed comfortable. He decided\nto hire it if the rent proved reasonable.",
        "“Well, what’s the tax?” asked Dick.",
        "“I ought to have a dollar a week,” said Mrs. Mooney, hesitatingly.",
        "“Say seventy-five cents, and I’ll take it,” said Dick.",
        "“Every week in advance?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Well, as times is hard, and I can’t afford to keep it empty, you\nmay have it. When will you come?”",
        "“To-night,” said Dick.",
        "“It aint lookin’ very neat. I don’t know as I can fix it up\nto-night.”",
        "“Well, I’ll sleep here to-night, and you can fix it up to-morrow.”",
        "“I hope you’ll excuse the looks. I’m a lone woman, and my help is so\nshiftless, I have to look after everything myself; so I can’t keep\nthings as straight as I want to.”",
        "“All right!” said Dick.",
        "“Can you pay me the first week in advance?” asked the landlady,\ncautiously.",
        "Dick responded by drawing seventy-five cents from his pocket, and\nplacing it in her hand.",
        "“What’s your business, sir, if I may inquire?” said Mrs. Mooney.",
        "“Oh, I’m professional!” said Dick.",
        "“Indeed!” said the landlady, who did not feel much enlightened by\nthis answer.",
        "“How’s Tom?” asked Dick.",
        "“Do you know my Tom?” said Mrs. Mooney in surprise. “He’s gone to\nsea,–to Californy. He went last week.”",
        "“Did he?” said Dick. “Yes, I knew him.”",
        "Mrs. Mooney looked upon her new lodger with increased favor, on\nfinding that he was acquainted with her son, who, by the way, was\none of the worst young scamps in Mott Street, which is saying\nconsiderable.",
        "“I’ll bring over my baggage from the Astor House this evening,” said\nDick in a tone of importance.",
        "“From the Astor House!” repeated Mrs. Mooney, in fresh amazement.",
        "“Yes, I’ve been stoppin’ there a short time with some friends,” said\nDick.",
        "Mrs. Mooney might be excused for a little amazement at finding that\na guest from the Astor House was about to become one of her\nlodgers–such transfers not being common.",
        "“Did you say you was purfessional?” she asked.",
        "“Yes, ma’am,” said Dick, politely.",
        "“You aint a–a–” Mrs. Mooney paused, uncertain what conjecture to\nhazard.",
        "“Oh, no, nothing of the sort,” said Dick, promptly. “How could you\nthink so, Mrs. Mooney?”",
        "“No offence, sir,” said the landlady, more perplexed than ever.",
        "“Certainly not,” said our hero. “But you must excuse me now, Mrs.\nMooney, as I have business of great importance to attend to.”",
        "“You’ll come round this evening?”",
        "Dick answered in the affirmative, and turned away.",
        "“I wonder what he is!” thought the landlady, following him with her\neyes as he crossed the street. “He’s got good clothes on, but he\ndon’t seem very particular about his room. Well; I’ve got all my\nrooms full now. That’s one comfort.”",
        "Dick felt more comfortable now that he had taken the decisive step\nof hiring a lodging, and paying a week’s rent in advance. For seven\nnights he was sure of a shelter and a bed to sleep in. The thought\nwas a pleasant one to our young vagrant, who hitherto had seldom\nknown when he rose in the morning where he should find a\nresting-place at night.",
        "“I must bring my traps round,” said Dick to himself. “I guess I’ll\ngo to bed early to-night. It’ll feel kinder good to sleep in a\nreg’lar bed. Boxes is rather hard to the back, and aint comfortable\nin case of rain. I wonder what Johnny Nolan would say if he knew I’d\ngot a room of my own.”",
