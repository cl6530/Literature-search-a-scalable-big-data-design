        "All lines had been cast off, and the Seattle No. 4 was pulling slowly\nout from the shore. Her decks were piled high with freight and baggage,\nand swarmed with a heterogeneous company of Indians, dogs, and\ndog-mushers, prospectors, traders, and homeward-bound gold-seekers. A\ngoodly portion of Dawson was lined up on the bank, saying good-by. As\nthe gang-plank came in and the steamer nosed into the stream, the clamor\nof farewell became deafening. Also, in that eleventh moment, everybody\nbegan to remember final farewell messages and to shout them back and\nforth across the widening stretch of water. Louis Bondell, curling his\nyellow mustache with one hand and languidly waving the other hand to his\nfriends on shore, suddenly remembered something and sprang to the rail.",
        "“Oh, Fred!” he bawled. “Oh, Fred!”",
        "The “Fred” desired thrust a strapping pair of shoulders through the\nforefront of the crowd on the bank and tried to catch Louis Bondell’s\nmessage. The latter grew red in the face with vain vociferation. Still\nthe water widened between steamboat and shore.",
        "“Hey you, Captain Scott!” he yelled at the pilot-house. “Stop the boat!”",
        "The gongs clanged, and the big stern wheel reversed, then stopped. All\nhands on steamboat and on bank took advantage of this respite to\nexchange final, new, and imperative farewells. More futile than ever was\nLouis Bondell’s effort to make himself heard. The Seattle No. 4 lost\nway and drifted down-stream, and Captain Scott had to go ahead and\nreverse a second time. His head disappeared inside the pilot-house,\ncoming into view a moment later behind a big megaphone.",
        "Now Captain Scott had a remarkable voice, and the “Shut up!” he\nlaunched at the crowd on deck and on shore could have been heard at the\ntop of Moosehide Mountain and as far as Klondike City. This official\nremonstrance from the pilot-house spread a film of silence over the\ntumult.",
        "“Now, what do you want to say?” Captain Scott demanded.",
        "“Tell Fred Churchill–he’s on the bank there–tell him to go to\nMacdonald. It’s in his safe–a small gripsack of mine. Tell him to get\nit and bring it out when he comes.”",
        "In the silence Captain Scott bellowed the message ashore through the\nmegaphone:–",
        "“You, Fred Churchill, go to Macdonald–in his safe–small\ngripsack–belongs to Louis Bondell–important! Bring it out when you\ncome! Got it?”",
        "Churchill waved his hand in token that he had got it. In truth, had\nMacdonald, half a mile away, opened his window, he’d have got it, too.\nThe tumult of farewell rose again, the gongs clanged, and the Seattle\nNo. 4 went ahead, swung out into the stream, turned on her heel, and\nheaded down the Yukon, Bondell and Churchill waving farewell and mutual\naffection to the last.",
        "That was in midsummer. In the fall of the year, the W.H. Willisstarted up the Yukon with two hundred homeward-bound pilgrims on board.\nAmong them was Churchill. In his stateroom, in the middle of a\nclothes-bag, was Louis Bondell’s grip. It was a small, stout leather\naffair, and its weight of forty pounds always made Churchill nervous\nwhen he wandered too far from it. The man in the adjoining stateroom had\na treasure of gold-dust hidden similarly in a clothes-bag, and the pair\nof them ultimately arranged to stand watch and watch. While one went\ndown to eat, the other kept an eye on the two stateroom doors. When\nChurchill wanted to take a hand at whist, the other man mounted guard,\nand when the other man wanted to relax his soul, Churchill read\nfour-months’-old newspapers on a camp stool between the two doors.",
        "There were signs of an early winter, and the question that was discussed\nfrom dawn till dark, and far into the dark, was whether they would get\nout before the freeze-up or be compelled to abandon the steamboat and\ntramp out over the ice. There were irritating delays. Twice the engines\nbroke down and had to be tinkered up, and each time there were snow\nflurries to warn them of the imminence of winter. Nine times the W.H.\nWillis essayed to ascend the Five-Finger Rapids with her impaired\nmachinery, and when she succeeded, she was four days behind her very\nliberal schedule. The question that then arose was whether or not the\nsteamboat Flora would wait for her above the Box Cañon. The stretch of\nwater between the head of the Box Cañon and the foot of the White Horse\nRapids was unnavigable for steamboats and passengers were transshipped\nat that point, walking around the rapids from one steamboat to the\nother. There were no telephones in the country, hence no way of\ninforming the waiting Flora that the Willis was four days late, but\ncoming.",
        "When the W.H. Willis pulled into White Horse, it was learned that the\nFlora had waited three days over the limit, and had departed only a\nfew hours before. Also, it was learned that she would tie up at Tagish\nPost till nine o’clock, Sunday morning. It was then four o’clock\nSaturday afternoon. The pilgrims called a meeting. On board was a large\nPeterborough canoe, consigned to the police post at the head of Lake\nBennett. They agreed to be responsible for it and to deliver it. Next,\nthey called for volunteers. Two men were needed to make a race for the\nFlora. A score of men volunteered on the instant. Among them was\nChurchill, such being his nature that he volunteered before he thought\nof Bondell’s gripsack. When this thought came to him, he began to hope\nthat he would not be selected; but a man who had made a name as captain\nof a college football eleven, as a president of an athletic club, as a\ndog-musher and a stampeder in the Yukon, and, moreover, who possessed\nsuch shoulders as he, had no right to avoid the honor. It was thrust\nupon him and upon a gigantic German, Nick Antonsen.",
        "While a crowd of the pilgrims, the canoe on their shoulders, started on\na trot over the portage, Churchill ran to his stateroom. He turned the\ncontents of the clothes-bag on the floor and caught up the grip with the\nintention of intrusting it to the man next door. Then the thought smote\nhim that it was not his grip, and that he had no right to let it out of\nhis own possession. So he dashed ashore with it and ran up the portage,\nchanging it often from one hand to the other, and wondering if it really\ndid not weigh more than forty pounds.",
        "It was half-past four in the afternoon when the two men started. The\ncurrent of the Thirty Mile River was so strong that rarely could they\nuse the paddles. It was out on one bank with a tow-line over the\nshoulders stumbling over the rocks, forcing a way through the\nunderbrush, slipping at times and falling into the water, wading often\nup to the knees and waist; and then, when an insurmountable bluff was\nencountered, it was into the canoe, out paddles, and a wild and losing\ndash across the current to the other bank, in paddles, over the side,\nand out tow-line again. It was exhausting work. Antonsen toiled like the\ngiant he was, uncomplaining, persistent, but driven to his utmost by the\npowerful body and indomitable brain of Churchill. They never paused for\nrest. It was go, go, and keep on going. A crisp wind blew down the\nriver, freezing their hands and making it imperative, from time to time,\nto beat the blood back into the numb fingers. As night came on, they\nwere compelled to trust to luck. They fell repeatedly on the untraveled\nbanks and tore their clothing to shreds in the underbrush they could not\nsee. Both men were badly scratched and bleeding. A dozen times, in their\nwild dashes from bank to bank, they struck snags and were capsized. The\nfirst time this happened, Churchill dived and groped in three feet of\nwater for the gripsack. He lost half an hour in recovering it, and after\nthat it was carried securely lashed to the canoe. As long as the canoe\nfloated it was safe. Antonsen jeered at the grip, and toward morning\nbegan to abuse it; but Churchill vouchsafed no explanations.",
        "Their delays and mischances were endless. On one swift bend, around\nwhich poured a healthy young rapid, they lost two hours, making a score\nof attempts and capsizing twice. At this point, on both banks, were\nprecipitous bluffs, rising out of deep water, and along which they could\nneither tow nor pole, while they could not gain with the paddles against\nthe current. At each attempt they strained to the utmost with the\npaddles, and each time, with hearts nigh to bursting from the effort,\nthey were played out and swept back. They succeeded finally by an\naccident. In the swiftest current, near the end of another failure, a\nfreak of the current sheered the canoe out of Churchill’s control and\nflung it against the bluff. Churchill made a blind leap at the bluff and\nlanded in a crevice. Holding on with one hand, he held the swamped canoe\nwith the other till Antonsen dragged himself out of the water. Then they\npulled the canoe out and rested. A fresh start at this crucial point\ntook them by. They landed on the bank above and plunged immediately\nashore and into the brush with the tow-line.",
        "Daylight found them far below Tagish Post. At nine o ’clock Sunday\nmorning they could hear the Flora whistling her departure. And when,\nat ten o’clock, they dragged themselves in to the Post, they could just\nbarely see the Flora’s smoke far to the southward. It was a pair of\nworn-out tatterdemalions that Captain Jones of the Mounted Police\nwelcomed and fed, and he afterward averred that they possessed two of\nthe most tremendous appetites he had ever observed. They lay down and\nslept in their wet rags by the stove. At the end of two hours Churchill\ngot up, carried Bondell’s grip, which he had used for a pillow, down to\nthe canoe, kicked Antonsen awake, and started in pursuit of the Flora.",
        "“There’s no telling what might happen–machinery break down or\nsomething,” was his reply to Captain Jones’s expostulations. “I’m going\nto catch that steamer and send her back for the boys.”",
        "Tagish Lake was white with a fall gale that blew in their teeth. Big,\nswinging seas rushed upon the canoe, compelling one man to bail and\nleaving one man to paddle. Headway could not be made. They ran along the\nshallow shore and went overboard, one man ahead on the tow-line, the\nother shoving on the canoe. They fought the gale up to their waists in\nthe icy water, often up to their necks, often over their heads and\nburied by the big, crested waves. There was no rest, never a moment’s\npause from the cheerless, heart-breaking battle. That night, at the head\nof Tagish Lake, in the thick of a driving snow-squall, they overhauled\nthe Flora. Antonsen. “You go back to White Horse, and snored.\n[Transcriber’s note: The above is evidently a printer’s error.]\nChurchill looked like a wild man. His clothes barely clung to him. His\nface was iced up and swollen from the protracted effort of twenty-four\nhours, while his hands were so swollen that he could not close the\nfingers. As for his feet, it was an agony to stand upon them.",
        "The captain of the Flora was loath to go back to White Horse.\nChurchill was persistent and imperative; the captain was stubborn. He\npointed out finally that nothing was to be gained by going back, because\nthe only ocean steamer at Dyea, the Athenian, was to sail on Tuesday\nmorning, and that he could not make the back trip to White Horse and\nbring up the stranded pilgrims in time to make the connection.",
        "“What time does the Athenian sail?” Churchill demanded.",
        "“Seven o’clock, Tuesday morning.”",
        "“All right,” Churchill said, at the same time kicking a tattoo on the\nribs of the snoring Antonsen. “You go back to White Horse. We’ll go\nahead and hold the Athenian.”",
        "Antonsen, stupid with sleep, not yet clothed in his waking mind, was\nbundled into the canoe, and did not realize what had happened till he\nwas drenched with the icy spray of a big sea, and heard Churchill\nsnarling at him through the darkness:–",
        "“Paddle, can’t you! Do you want to be swamped?”",
        "Daylight found them at Caribou Crossing, the wind dying down, and\nAntonsen too far gone to dip a paddle. Churchill grounded the canoe on a\nquiet beach, where they slept. He took the precaution of twisting his\narm under the weight of his head. Every few minutes the pain of the pent\ncirculation aroused him, whereupon he would look at his watch and twist\nthe other arm under his head. At the end of two hours he fought with\nAntonsen to rouse him. Then they started. Lake Bennett, thirty miles in\nlength, was like a mill-pond; but, halfway across, a gale from the south\nsmote them and turned the water white. Hour after hour they repeated the\nstruggle on Tagish, over the side, pulling and shoving on the canoe, up\nto their waists and necks, and over their heads, in the icy water;\ntoward the last the good-natured giant played completely out. Churchill\ndrove him mercilessly; but when he pitched forward and bade fair to\ndrown in three feet of water, the other dragged him into the canoe.\nAfter that, Churchill fought on alone, arriving at the police post at\nthe head of Bennett in the early afternoon. He tried to help Antonsen\nout of the canoe, but failed. He listened to the exhausted man’s heavy\nbreathing, and envied him when he thought of what he himself had yet to\nundergo. Antonsen could lie there and sleep; but he, behind time, must\ngo on over mighty Chilcoot and down to the sea. The real struggle lay\nbefore him, and he almost regretted the strength that resided in his\nframe because of the torment it could inflict upon that frame.",
        "Churchill pulled the canoe up on the beach, seized Bondell’s grip, and\nstarted on a limping dog-trot for the police post.",
        "“There’s a canoe down there, consigned to you from Dawson,” he hurled at\nthe officer who answered his knock. “And there’s a man in it pretty near\ndead. Nothing serious; only played out. Take care of him. I’ve got to\nrush. Good-by. Want to catch the Athenian.”",
        "A mile portage connected Lake Bennett and Lake Linderman, and his last\nwords he flung back after him as he resumed the trot. It was a very\npainful trot, but he clenched his teeth and kept on, forgetting his pain\nmost of the time in the fervent heat with which he regarded the\ngripsack. It was a severe handicap. He swung it from one hand to the\nother, and back again. He tucked it under his arm. He threw one hand\nover the opposite shoulder, and the bag bumped and pounded on his back\nas he ran along. He could scarcely hold it in his bruised and swollen\nfingers, and several times he dropped it. Once, in changing from one\nhand to the other, it escaped his clutch and fell in front of him,\ntripped him up, and threw him violently to the ground.",
        "At the far end of the portage he bought an old set of pack-straps for a\ndollar, and in them he swung the grip. Also, he chartered a launch to\nrun him the six miles to the upper end of Lake Linderman, where he\narrived at four in the afternoon. The Athenian was to sail from Dyea\nnext morning at seven. Dyea was twenty-eight miles away, and between\ntowered Chilcoot. He sat down to adjust his foot-gear for the long\nclimb, and woke up. He had dozed the instant he sat down, though he had\nnot slept thirty seconds. He was afraid his next doze might be longer,\nso he finished fixing his foot-gear standing up. Even then he was\noverpowered for a fleeting moment. He experienced the flash of\nunconsciousness; becoming aware of it, in midair, as his relaxed body\nwas sinking to the ground and as he caught himself together, he\nstiffened his muscles with a spasmodic wrench, and escaped the fall. The\nsudden jerk back to consciousness left him sick and trembling. He beat\nhis head with the heel of his hand, knocking wakefulness into the numb\nbrain.",
        "Jack Burns’s pack-train was starting back light for Crater Lake, and\nChurchill was invited to a mule. Burns wanted to put the gripsack on\nanother animal, but Churchill held on to it, carrying it on his\nsaddle-pommel. But he dozed, and the grip persisted in dropping off the\npommel, one side or the other, each time wakening him with a sickening\nstart. Then, in the early darkness, Churchill’s mule brushed him against\na projecting branch that laid his cheek open. To cap it, the mule\nblundered off the trail and fell, throwing rider and gripsack out upon\nthe rocks. After that, Churchill walked, or stumbled, rather, over the\napology for a trail, leading the mule. Stray and awful odors, drifting\nfrom each side the trail, told of the horses that had died in the rush\nfor gold. But he did not mind. He was too sleepy. By the time Long Lake\nwas reached, however, he had recovered from his sleepiness; and at Deep\nLake he resigned the gripsack to Burns. But thereafter, by the light of\nthe dim stars, he kept his eyes on Burns. There were not going to be any\naccidents with that bag.",
        "At Crater Lake the pack-train went into camp, and Churchill, slinging\nthe grip on his back, started the steep climb for the summit. For the\nfirst time, on that precipitous wall, he realized how tired he was. He\ncrept and crawled like a crab, burdened by the weight of his limbs. A\ndistinct and painful effort of will was required each time he lifted a\nfoot. An hallucination came to him that he was shod with lead, like a\ndeep-sea diver, and it was all he could do to resist the desire to reach\ndown and feel the lead. As for Bondell’s gripsack, it was inconceivable\nthat forty pounds could weigh so much. It pressed him down like a\nmountain, and he looked back with unbelief to the year before, when he\nhad climbed that same pass with a hundred and fifty pounds on his back,\nIf those loads had weighed a hundred and fifty pounds, then Bondell’s\ngrip weighed five hundred.",
        "The first rise of the divide from Crater Lake was across a small\nglacier. Here was a well-defined trail. But above the glacier, which was\nalso above timber-line, was naught but a chaos of naked rock and\nenormous boulders. There was no way of seeing the trail in the darkness,\nand he blundered on, paying thrice the ordinary exertion for all that he\naccomplished. He won the summit in the thick of howling wind and driving\nsnow, providentially stumbling upon a small, deserted tent, into which\nhe crawled. There he found and bolted some ancient fried potatoes and\nhalf a dozen raw eggs.",
        "When the snow ceased and the wind eased down, he began the almost\nimpossible descent. There was no trail, and he stumbled and blundered,\noften finding himself, at the last moment, on the edge of rocky walls\nand steep slopes the depth of which he had no way of judging. Part way\ndown, the stars clouded over again, and in the consequent obscurity he\nslipped and rolled and slid for a hundred feet, landing bruised and\nbleeding on the bottom of a large shallow hole. From all about him arose\nthe stench of dead horses. The hole was handy to the trail, and the\npackers had made a practice of tumbling into it their broken and dying\nanimals. The stench overpowered him, making him deathly sick, and as in\na nightmare he scrambled out. Halfway up, he recollected Bondell’s\ngripsack. It had fallen into the hole with him; the pack-strap had\nevidently broken, and he had forgotten it. Back he went into the\npestilential charnel-pit, where he crawled around on hands and knees and\ngroped for half an hour. Altogether he encountered and counted seventeen\ndead horses (and one horse still alive that he shot with his revolver)\nbefore he found Bondell’s grip. Looking back upon a life that had not\nbeen without valor and achievement, he unhesitatingly declared to\nhimself that this return after the grip was the most heroic act he had\never performed. So heroic was it that he was twice on the verge of\nfainting before he crawled out of the hole.",
        "By the time he had descended to the Scales, the steep pitch of Chilcoot\nwas past, and the way became easier. Not that it was an easy way,\nhowever, in the best of places; but it became a really possible trail,\nalong which he could have made good time if he had not been worn out, if\nhe had had light with which to pick his steps, and if it had not been\nfor Bondell’s gripsack. To him, in his exhausted condition, it was the\nlast straw. Having barely strength to carry himself along, the\nadditional weight of the grip was sufficient to throw him nearly every\ntime he tripped or stumbled. And when he escaped tripping, branches\nreached out in the darkness, hooked the grip between his shoulders, and\nheld him back.",
        "His mind was made up that if he missed the Athenian it would be the\nfault of the gripsack. In fact, only two things remained in his\nconsciousness–Bondell’s grip and the steamer. He knew only those two\nthings, and they became identified, in a way, with some stern mission\nupon which he had journeyed and toiled for centuries. He walked and\nstruggled on as in a dream. A part of the dream was his arrival at Sheep\nCamp. He stumbled into a saloon, slid his shoulders out of the straps,\nand started to deposit the grip at his feet. But it slipped from his\nfingers and struck the floor with a heavy thud that was not unnoticed by\ntwo men who were just leaving. Churchill drank a glass of whiskey, told\nthe barkeeper to call him in ten minutes, and sat down, his feet on the\ngrip, his head on his knees.",
        "So badly did his misused body stiffen, that when he was called it\nrequired another ten minutes and a second glass of whiskey to unbend his\njoints and limber up the muscles.",
        "“Hey! not that way!” the barkeeper shouted, and then went after him and\nstarted him through the darkness toward Canyon City. Some little husk of\ninner consciousness told Churchill that the direction was right, and,\nstill as in a dream, he took the canyon trail. He did not know what\nwarned him, but after what seemed several centuries of travelling, he\nsensed danger and drew his revolver. Still in the dream, he saw two men\nstep out and heard them halt him. His revolver went off four times, and\nhe saw the flashes and heard the explosions of their revolvers. Also, he\nwas aware that he had been hit in the thigh. He saw one man go down,\nand, as the other came for him, he smashed him a straight blow with the\nheavy revolver full in the face. Then he turned and ran. He came from\nthe dream shortly afterward, to find himself plunging down the trail at\na limping lope. His first thought was for the gripsack. It was still on\nhis back. He was convinced that what had happened was a dream till he\nfelt for his revolver and found it gone. Next he became aware of a sharp\nstinging of his thigh, and after investigating, he found his hand warm\nwith blood. It was a superficial wound, but it was incontestable. He\nbecame wider awake, and kept up the lumbering run to Canyon City.",
        "He found a man, with a team of horses and a wagon, who got out of bed\nand harnessed up for twenty dollars. Churchill crawled in on the\nwagon-bed and slept, the gripsack still on his back. It was a rough\nride, over water-washed boulders down the Dyea Valley; but he roused\nonly when the wagon hit the highest places. Any altitude of his body\nabove the wagon-bed of less than a foot did not faze him. The last mile\nwas smooth going, and he slept soundly.",
        "He came to in the gray dawn, the driver shaking him savagely and howling\ninto his ear that the Athenian was gone. Churchill looked blankly at\nthe deserted harbor.",
        "“There’s a smoke over at Skaguay,” the man said.",
        "Churchill’s eyes were too swollen to see that far, but he said: “It’s\nshe. Get me a boat.”",
        "The driver was obliging, and found a skiff and a man to row it for ten\ndollars, payment in advance. Churchill paid, and was helped into the\nskiff. It was beyond him to get in by himself. It was six miles to\nSkaguay, and he had a blissful thought of sleeping those six miles. But\nthe man did not know how to row, and Churchill took the oars and toiled\nfor a few more centuries. He never knew six longer and more excruciating\nmiles. A snappy little breeze blew up the inlet and held him back. He\nhad a gone feeling at the pit of the stomach, and suffered from\nfaintness and numbness. At his command, the man took the bailer and\nthrew salt water into his face.",
        "The Athenian’s anchor was up-and-down when they came alongside, and\nChurchill was at the end of his last remnant of strength.",
        "“Stop her! Stop her!” he shouted hoarsely. “Important message! Stop\nher!”",
        "Then he dropped his chin on his chest and slept. “When half a dozen men\nstarted to carry him up the gang-plank, he awoke, reached for the grip,\nand clung to it like a drowning man. On deck he became a center of\nhorror and curiosity. The clothing in which he had left White Horse was\nrepresented by a few rags, and he was as frayed as his clothing. He had\ntraveled for fifty-five hours at the top notch of endurance. He had\nslept six hours in that time, and he was twenty pounds lighter than when\nhe started. Face and hands and body were scratched and bruised, and he\ncould scarcely see. He tried to stand up, but failed, sprawling out on\nthe deck, hanging on to the gripsack, and delivering his message.",
        "“Now, put me to bed,” he finished; “I’ll eat when I wake up.”",
        "They did him honor, carrying him down in his rags and dirt and\ndepositing him and Bondell’s grip in the bridal chamber, which was the\nbiggest and most luxurious stateroom in the ship. Twice he slept the\nclock around, and he had bathed and shaved and eaten and was leaning\nover the rail smoking a cigar when the two hundred pilgrims from White\nHorse came alongside.",
        "By the time the Athenian arrived in Seattle, Churchill had fully\nrecuperated, and he went ashore with Bondell’s grip in his hand. He\nfelt proud of that grip. To him it stood for achievement and integrity\nand trust. “I’ve delivered the goods,” was the way he expressed these\nvarious high terms to himself. It was early in the evening, and he went\nstraight to Bondell’s home. Louis Bondell was glad to see him, shaking\nhands with both hands at the same time and dragging him into the house.",
        "“Oh, thanks, old man; it was good of you to bring it out,” Bondell said\nwhen he received the gripsack.",
        "He tossed it carelessly upon a couch, and Churchill noted with an\nappreciative eye the rebound of its weight from the springs. Bondell was\nvolleying him with questions.",
        "“How did you make out? How’re the boys! What became of Bill Smithers? Is\nDel Bishop still with Pierce? Did he sell my dogs? How did Sulphur\nBottom show up? You’re looking fine. What steamer did you come out on?”",
        "To all of which Churchill gave answer, till half an hour had gone by and\nthe first lull in the conversation had arrived.",
        "“Hadn’t you better take a look at it?” he suggested, nodding his head at\nthe gripsack.",
        "“Oh, it’s all right,” Bondell answered. “Did Mitchell’s dump turn out\nas much as he expected?”",
        "“I think you’d better look at it,” Churchill insisted. “When I deliver a\nthing, I want to be satisfied that it’s all right. There’s always the\nchance that somebody might have got into it when I was asleep, or\nsomething.”",
        "“It’s nothing important, old man,” Bondell answered, with a laugh.",
        "“Nothing important,” Churchill echoed in a faint, small voice. Then he\nspoke with decision: “Louis, what’s in that bag? I want to know.”",
        "Louis looked at him curiously, then left the room and returned with a\nbunch of keys. He inserted his hand and drew out a heavy .44 Colt’s\nrevolver. Next came out a few boxes of ammunition for the revolver and\nseveral boxes of Winchester cartridges.",
        "Churchill took the gripsack and looked into it. Then he turned it upside\ndown and shook it gently.",
        "“The gun’s all rusted,” Bondell said. “Must have been out in the rain.”",
        "“Yes,” Churchill answered. “Too bad it got wet. I guess I was a bit\ncareless.”",
        "He got up and went outside. Ten minutes later Louis Bondell went out\nand found him on the steps, sitting down, elbows on knees and chin on\nhands, gazing steadfastly out into the darkness.",
