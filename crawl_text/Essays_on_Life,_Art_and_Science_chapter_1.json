        "\nSamuel Butler (1835 - 1902)\nEnglish composer, novelist, and satiric author\n",
        "\n\n",
        "It is hardly necessary to apologise for the miscellaneous character\nof the following collection of essays.  Samuel Butler was a man of\nsuch unusual versatility, and his interests were so many and so\nvarious that his literary remains were bound to cover a wide field.\nNevertheless it will be found that several of the subjects to which\nhe devoted much time and labour are not represented in these pages.\nI have not thought it necessary to reprint any of the numerous\npamphlets and articles which he wrote upon the Iliad and Odyssey,\nsince these were all merged in “The Authoress of the Odyssey,” which\ngives his matured views upon everything relating to the Homeric\npoems.  For a similar reason I have not included an essay on the\nevidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, which he printed in\n1865 for private circulation, since he subsequently made extensive\nuse of it in “The Fair Haven.”",
        "Two of the essays in this collection were originally delivered as\nlectures; the remainder were published in The Universal Review\nduring 1888, 1889, and 1890.",
        "I should perhaps explain why two other essays of his, which also\nappeared in The Universal Review, have been omitted.",
        "The first of these, entitled “L’Affaire Holbein-Rippel,\" relates to\na drawing of Holbein’s “Danse des Paysans,” in the Basle Museum,\nwhich is usually described as a copy, but which Butler believed to\nbe the work of Holbein himself.  This essay requires to be\nillustrated in so elaborate a manner that it was impossible to\ninclude it in a book of this size.",
        "The second essay, which is a sketch of the career of the sculptor\nTabachetti, was published as the first section of an article\nentitled “A Sculptor and a Shrine,” of which the second section is\nhere given under the title, “The Sanctuary of Montrigone.”  The\nsection devoted to the sculptor represents all that Butler then knew\nabout Tabachetti, but since it was written various documents have\ncome to light, principally owing to the investigations of Cavaliere\nFrancesco Negri, of Casale Monferrato, which negative some of\nButler’s most cherished conclusions.  Had Butler lived he would\neither have rewritten his essay in accordance with Cavaliere Negri’s\ndiscoveries, of which he fully recognised the value, or incorporated\nthem into the revised edition of “Ex Voto,” which he intended to\npublish.  As it stands, the essay requires so much revision that I\nhave decided to omit it altogether, and to postpone giving English\nreaders a full account of Tabachetti’s career until a second edition\nof “Ex Voto” is required.  Meanwhile I have given a brief summary of\nthe main facts of Tabachetti’s life in a note (page 154) to the\nessay on “Art in the Valley of Saas.”  Any one who wishes for\nfurther details of the sculptor and his work will find them in\nCavaliere Negri’s pamphlet, “Il Santuario di Crea” (Alessandria,\n1902).",
        "The three essays grouped together under the title of “The Deadlock\nin Darwinism” may be regarded as a postscript to Butler’s four books\non evolution, viz., “Life and Habit,” “Evolution, Old and New,\"\n“Unconscious Memory” and “Luck or Cunning.”  An occasion for the\npublication of these essays seemed to be afforded by the appearance\nin 1889 of Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace’s “Darwinism\"; and although\nnearly fourteen years have elapsed since they were published in the\nUniversal Review, I have no fear that they will be found to be out\nof date.  How far, indeed, the problem embodied in the deadlock of\nwhich Butler speaks is from solution was conclusively shown by the\ncorrespondence which appeared in the Times in May 1903, occasioned\nby some remarks made at University College by Lord Kelvin in moving\na vote of thanks to Professor Henslow after his lecture on “Present\nDay Rationalism.”  Lord Kelvin’s claim for a recognition of the fact\nthat in organic nature scientific thought is compelled to accept the\nidea of some kind of directive power, and his statement that\nbiologists are coming once more to a firm acceptance of a vital\nprinciple, drew from several distinguished men of science retorts\nheated enough to prove beyond a doubt that the gulf between the two\nmain divisions of evolutionists is as wide to-day as it was when\nButler wrote.  It will be well, perhaps, for the benefit of readers\nwho have not followed the history of the theory of evolution during\nits later developments, to state in a few words what these two main\ndivisions are.  All evolutionists agree that the differences between\nspecies are caused by the accumulation and transmission of\nvariations, but they do not agree as to the causes to which the\nvariations are due.  The view held by the older evolutionists,\nBuffon, Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck, who have been followed by many\nmodern thinkers, including Herbert Spencer and Butler, is that the\nvariations occur mainly as the result of effort and design; the\nopposite view, which is that advocated by Mr. Wallace in\n“Darwinism,” is that the variations occur merely as the result of\nchance.  The former is sometimes called the theological view,\nbecause it recognises the presence in organic nature of design,\nwhether it be called creative power, directive force, directivity,\nor vital principle; the latter view, in which the existence of\ndesign is absolutely negatived, is now usually described as\nWeismannism, from the name of the writer who has been its principal\nadvocate in recent years.",
        "In conclusion, I must thank my friend Mr. Henry Festing Jones most\nwarmly for the invaluable assistance which he has given me in\npreparing these essays for publication, in correcting the proofs,\nand in compiling the introduction and notes.",
