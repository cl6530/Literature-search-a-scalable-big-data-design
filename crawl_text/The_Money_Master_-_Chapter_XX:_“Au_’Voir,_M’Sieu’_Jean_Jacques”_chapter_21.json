        "It is seldom that Justice travels as swiftly as Crime, and it is also\nseldom that the luck is more with the law than with the criminal.  It\ntook the parish of St. Saviour’s so long to make up its mind who stole\nJean Jacques’ six thousand dollars, that when the hounds got the scent at\nlast the quarry had reached the water–in other words, Sebastian Dolores\nhad achieved the St. Lawrence.  The criminal had had near a day’s start\nbefore a telegram was sent to the police at Montreal, Quebec, and other\nplaces to look out for the picaroon who had left his mark on the parish\nof St. Saviour’s.  The telegram would not even then have been sent had it\nnot been for M. Fille, who, suspecting Sebastian Dolores, still refrained\nfrom instant action.  This he did because he thought Jean Jacques would\nnot wish his beloved Zoe’s grandfather sent to prison.  But when other\npeople at last declared that it must have been Dolores, M. Fille insisted\non telegrams being sent by the magistrate at Vilray without Jean Jacques’\nconsent.  He had even urged the magistrate to “rush” the wire, because it\ncame home to him with stunning force that, if the money was not\nrecovered, Jean Jacques would be a beggar.  It was better to jail the\nfather-in-law, than for the little money-master to take to the road a\npauper, or stay on at St. Saviour’s as an underling where he had been\noverlord.",
        "As for Jean Jacques, in his heart of hearts he knew who had robbed him.\nHe realized that it was one of the radii of the comedy-tragedy which\nbegan on the Antoine, so many years before; and it had settled in his\nmind at last that Sebastian Dolores was but part of the dark machinery\nof fate, and that what was now had to be.",
        "For one whole day after the robbery he was like a man paralysed–\ndispossessed of active being; but when his creditors began to swarm, when\nM. Mornay sent his man of business down to foreclose his mortgages before\nothers could take action, Jean Jacques waked from his apathy.  He began\nan imitation of his old restlessness, and made essay again to pull the\nstrings of his affairs.  They were, however, so confused that a pull at\none string tangled them all.",
        "When the constables and others came to him, and said that they were on\nthe trail of the robber, and that the rogue would be caught, he nodded\nhis head encouragingly; but he was sure in his own mind that the flight\nof Dolores would be as successful as that of Carmen and Zoe.",
        "This is the way he put it: “That man–we will just miss finding him,\nas I missed Zoe at the railroad junction when she went away, as I missed\ncatching Carmen at St. Chrisanthine.  When you are at the shore, he will\nbe on the river; when you are getting into the train, he will be getting\nout.  It is the custom of the family.  At Bordeaux, the Spanish\ndetectives were on the shore gnashing their teeth, when he was a hundred\nyards away at sea on the Antoine.  They missed him like that; and we’ll\nmiss him too.  What is the good!  It was not his fault–that was the way\nof his bringing up beyond there at Cadiz, where they think more of a\ntoreador than of John the Baptist.  It was my fault.  I ought to have\nbanked the money.  I ought not to have kept it to look at like a gamin\nwith his marbles.  There it was in the wall; and there was Dolores a long\nway from home and wanting to get back.  He found the way by a gift of the\ntools; and I wish I had the same gift now; for I’ve got no other gift\nthat’ll earn anything for me.”",
        "These were the last dark or pessimistic words spoken at St. Saviour’s by\nJean Jacques; and they were said to the Clerk of the Court, who could not\ndeny the truth of them; but he wrung the hand of Jean Jacques\nnevertheless, and would not leave him night or day.  M. Fille was like a\nlittle cruiser protecting a fort when gunboats swarm near, not daring to\nattack till their battleship heaves in sight.  The battleship was the\nBig Financier, who saw that a wreck was now inevitable, and was only\nconcerned that there should be a fair distribution of the assets.  That\nmeant, of course, that he should be served first, and then that those\nbelow the salt should get a share.",
        "Revelation after revelation had been Jean Jacques’ lot of late years,\nbut the final revelation of his own impotence was overwhelming.  When\nhe began to stir about among his affairs, he was faced by the fact that\nthe law stood in his way.  He realized with inward horror his shattered\negotism and natural vanity; he saw that he might just as well be in jail;\nthat he had no freedom; that he could do nothing at all in regard to\nanything he owned; that he was, in effect, a prisoner of war where\nhe had been the general commanding an army.",
        "Yet the old pride intervened, and it was associated with some innate\nnobility; for from the hour in which it was known that Sebastian Dolores\nhad escaped in a steamer bound for France, and could not be overhauled,\nand the chances were that he would never have to yield up the six\nthousand dollars, Jean Jacques bustled about cheerfully, and as though\nhe had still great affairs of business to order and regulate.  It was a\nmake-believe which few treated with scorn.  Even the workmen at the mill\nhumoured him, as he came several times every day to inspect the work of\nrebuilding; and they took his orders, though they did not carry them out.\nNo one really carried out any of his orders except Seraphe Corniche, who,\nweeping from morning till night, protested that there never was so good a\nman as M’sieu’ Jean Jacques; and she cooked his favourite dishes, giving\nhim no peace until he had eaten them.",
        "The days, the weeks went on, with Jean Jacques growing thinner and\nthinner, but going about with his head up like the gold Cock of Beaugard,\nand even crowing now and then, as he had done of yore.  He faced the\ninevitable with something of his old smiling volubility; treating nothing\nof his disaster as though it really existed; signing off this asset and\nthat; disposing of this thing and that; stripping himself bare of all the\nproperties on his life’s stage, in such a manner as might have been his\nhad he been receiving gifts and not yielding up all he owned.  He chatted\nas his belongings were, figuratively speaking, being carried away–as\nthough they were mechanical, formal things to be done as he had done them\nevery day of a fairly long life; as a clerk would check off the boxes or\nparcels carried past him by the porters.  M. Fille could hardly bear to\nsee him in this mood, and the New Cure hovered round him with a mournful\nand harmlessly deceptive kindness.  But the end had to come, and\npractically all the parish was present when it came.  That was on the\nday when the contents of the Manor were sold at auction by order of the\nCourt.  One thing Jean Jacques refused absolutely and irrevocably to do\nfrom the first–refused it at last in anger and even with an oath: he\nwould not go through the Bankruptcy Court.  No persuasion had any effect.\nThe very suggestion seemed to smirch his honour.  His lawyer pleaded with\nhim, said he would be able to save something out of the wreck, and that\nhis creditors would be willing that he should take advantage of the\nprivileges of that court; but he only said in reply:",
        "“Thank you, thank you altogether, monsieur, but it is impossible–’non\npossumus, non possumus, my son,’ as the Pope said to Bonaparte.  I owe\nand I will pay what I can; and what I can’t pay now I will try to pay in\nthe future, by the cent, by the dollar, till all is paid to the last\ncopper.  It is the way with the Barbilles.  They have paid their way and\ntheir debts in honour, and it is in the bond with all the Barbilles of\nthe past that I do as they do.  If I can’t do it, then that I have tried\nto do it will be endorsed on the foot of the bill.”",
        "No one could move him, not even Judge Carcasson, who from his armchair in\nMontreal wrote a feeble-handed letter begging him to believe that it was\n“well within his rights as a gentleman\"–this he put in at the request of\nM. Mornay–to take advantage of the privileges of the Bankruptcy Court.\nEven then Jean Jacques had only a few moments’ hesitation.  What the\nJudge said made a deep impression; but he had determined to drink the cup\nof his misfortune to the dregs.  He was set upon complete renunciation;\non going forth like a pilgrim from the place of his troubles and sorrows,\ntaking no gifts, no mercies save those which heaven accorded him.",
        "When the day of the auction came everything went.  Even his best suit\nof clothes was sold to a blacksmith, while his fur-coat was bought by a\nhorse-doctor for fifteen dollars.  Things that had been part of his life\nfor a generation found their way into hands where he would least have\nwished them to go–of those who had been envious of him, who had cheated\nor deceived him, of people with whom he had had nothing in common.  The\nred wagon and the pair of little longtailed stallions, which he had\ndriven for six years, were bought by the owner of a rival flour-mill in\nthe parish of Vilray; but his best sleigh, with its coon-skin robes, was\nbought by the widow of Palass Poucette, who bought also the famous\nbearskin which Dolores had given her at Jean Jacques’ expense, and had\nbeen returned by her to its proper owner.  The silver fruitdish, once (it\nwas said) the property of the Baron of Beaugard, which each generation of\nBarbilles had displayed with as much ceremony as though it was a chalice\ngiven by the Pope, went to Virginie Poucette.  Virginie also bought the\nfurniture from Zoe’s bedroom as it stood, together with the little\nupright piano on which she used to play.  The Cure bought Jean Jacques’\nwriting-desk, and M. Fille purchased his armchair, in which had sat at\nleast six Barbilles as owners of the Manor.  The beaver-hat which Jean\nJacques wore on state occasions, as his grandfather had done, together\nwith the bonnet rouge of the habitant, donned by him in his younger days\n–they fell to the nod of Mere Langlois, who declared that, as she was a\ncousin, she would keep the things in the family.  Mere Langlois would\nhave bought the fruit-dish also if she could have afforded to bid against\nVirginie Poucette; but the latter would have had the dish if it had cost\nher two hundred dollars.  The only time she had broken bread in Jean\nJacques’ house, she had eaten cake from this fruit-dish; and to her,\nas to the parish generally, the dish so beautifully shaped, with its\ngraceful depth and its fine-chased handles, was symbol of the social\ncaste of the Barbilles, as the gold Cock of Beaugard was sign of their\ncivic and commercial glory.",
        "Jean Jacques, who had moved about all day with an almost voluble\naffability, seeming not to realize the tragedy going on, or, if he\nrealized it, rising superior to it, was noticed to stand still suddenly\nwhen the auctioneer put up the fruit-dish for sale.  Then the smile left\nhis face, and the reddish glow in his eyes, which had been there since\nthe burning of the mill, fled, and a touch of amazement and confusion\ntook its place.  All in a moment he was like a fluttered dweller of the\nwilds to whom comes some tremor of danger.",
        "His mouth opened as though he would forbid the selling of the heirloom;\nbut it closed again, because he knew he had no right to withhold it from\nthe hammer; and he took on a look like that which comes to the eyes of a\nchild when it faces humiliating denial.  Quickly as it came, however, it\nvanished, for he remembered that he could buy the dish himself.  He could\nbuy it himself and keep it.  .  .  .  Yet what could he do with it?  Even\nso, he could keep it.  It could still be his till better days came.",
        "The auctioneer’s voice told off the value of the fruitdish–\"As an\nheirloom, as an antique; as a piece of workmanship impossible of\nduplication in these days of no handicraft; as good pure silver, bearing\nthe head of Louis Quinze–beautiful, marvellous, historic, honourable,\"\nand Jean Jacques made ready to bid.  Then he remembered he had no money–\nhe who all his life had been able to take a roll of bills from his pocket\nas another man took a packet of letters.  His glance fell in shame, and\nthe words died on his lips, even as M. Manotel, the auctioneer, was about\nto add another five-dollar bid to the price, which already was standing\nat forty dollars.",
        "It was at this moment Jean Jacques heard a woman’s voice bidding, then\ntwo women’s voices.  Looking up he saw that one of the women was Mere\nLanglois and the other was Virginie Poucette, who had made the first bid.\nFor a moment they contended, and then Mere Langlois fell out of the\ncontest, and Virginie continued it with an ambitious farmer from the next\ncounty, who was about to become a Member of Parliament.  Presently the\nowner of a river pleasure-steamer entered into the costly emulation also,\nbut he soon fell away; and Virginie Poucette stubbornly raised the\nbidding by five dollars each time, till the silver symbol of the\nBarbilles’ pride had reached one hundred dollars.  Then she raised the\nprice by ten dollars, and her rival, seeing that he was face to face with\na woman who would now bid till her last dollar was at stake, withdrew;\nand Virginie was left triumphant with the heirloom.",
        "At the moment when Virginie turned away with the handsome dish from M.\nManotel, and the crowd cheered her gaily, she caught Jean-Jacques’ eye,\nand she came straight towards him.  She wanted to give the dish to him\nthen and there; but she knew that this would provide annoying gossip for\nmany a day, and besides, she thought he would refuse.  More than\nthat, she had in her mind another alternative which might in the end\nsecure the heirloom to him, in spite of all.  As she passed him,\nshe said:",
        "“At least we keep it in the parish.  If you don’t have it, well, then...”",
        "She paused, for she did not quite know what to say unless she spoke what\nwas really in her mind, and she dared not do that.",
        "“But you ought to have an heirloom,” she added, leaving unsaid what was\nher real thought and hope.  With sudden inspiration, for he saw she was\ntrying to make it easy for him, he drew the great silver-watch from his\npocket, which the head of the Barbilles had worn for generations, and\nsaid:",
        "“I have the only heirloom I could carry about with me.  It will keep time\nfor me as long as I’ll last.  The Manor clock strikes the time for the\nworld, and this watch is set by the Manor clock.”",
        "“Well said–well and truly said, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques,” remarked the lean\nwatchmaker and so-called jeweller of Vilray, who stood near.  “It is a\nwatch which couldn’t miss the stroke of Judgment Day.”",
        "It was at that moment, in the sunset hour, when the sale had drawn to a\nclose, and the people had begun to disperse, that the avocat of Vilray\nwho represented the Big Financier came to Jean Jacques and said:",
        "“M’sieu’, I have to say that there is due to you three hundred and fifty\ndollars from the settlement, excluding this sale, which will just do what\nwas expected of it.  I am instructed to give it to you from the\ncreditors.  Here it is.”",
        "He took out a roll of bills and offered it to Jean Jacques.",
        "“What creditors?” asked Jean Jacques.",
        "“All the creditors,” responded the other, and he produced a receipt for\nJean Jacques to sign.  “A formal statement will be sent you, and if there\nis any more due to you, it will be added then.  But now–well, there it\nis, the creditors think there is no reason for you to wait.”",
        "Jean Jacques did not yet take the roll of bills.  “They come from M.\nMornay?” he asked with an air of resistance, for he did not wish to be\nunder further obligations to the man who would lose most by him.",
        "The lawyer was prepared.  M. Mornay had foreseen the timidity and\nsensitiveness of Jean Jacques, had anticipated his mistaken chivalry–for\nhow could a man decline to take advantage of the Bankruptcy Court unless\nhe was another Don Quixote!  He had therefore arranged with all the\ncreditors for them to take responsibility with ’himself, though he\nprovided the cash which manipulated this settlement.",
        "“No, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques,” the lawyer replied, this comes from all the\ncreditors, as the sum due to you from all the transactions, so far as can\nbe seen as yet.  Further adjustment may be necessary, but this is the\ninterim settlement.”",
        "Jean Jacques was far from being ignorant of business, but so bemused was\nhis judgment and his intelligence now, that he did not see there was no\nbalance which could possibly be his, since his liabilities vastly\nexceeded his assets.  Yet with a wave of the hand he accepted the roll of\nbills, and signed the receipt with an air which said, “These forms must\nbe observed, I suppose.”",
        "What he would have done if the three hundred and fifty dollars had not\nbeen given him, it would be hard to say, for with gentle asperity he had\ndeclined a loan from his friend M. Fille, and he had but one silver\ndollar in his pocket, or in the world.  Indeed, Jean Jacques was living\nin a dream in these dark days–a dream of renunciation and sacrifice, and\nin the spirit of one who gives up all to some great cause.  He was not\nyet even face to face with the fulness of his disaster.  Only at moments\nhad the real significance of it all come to him, and then he had shivered\nas before some terror menacing his path.  Also, as M. Mornay had said,\nhis philosophy was now in his bones and marrow rather than in his words.\nIt had, after all, tinctured his blood and impregnated his mind.  He had\nbabbled and been the egotist, and played cock o’ the walk; and now at\nlast his philosophy was giving some foundation for his feet.  Yet at\nthis auction-sale he looked a distracted, if smiling, whimsical, rather\nbustling figure of misfortune, with a tragic air of exile, of isolation\nfrom all by which he was surrounded.  A profound and wayworn loneliness\nshowed in his figure, in his face, in his eyes.",
        "The crowd thinned in time, and yet very many lingered to see the last of\nthis drama of lost fortunes.  A few of the riff-raff, who invariably\nattend these public scenes, were now rather the worse for drink, from the\nindifferent liquor provided by the auctioneer, and they were inclined to\nhorseplay and coarse chaff.  More than one ribald reference to Jean\nJacques had been checked by his chivalrous fellow-citizens; indeed, M.\nFille had almost laid himself open to a charge of assault in his own\ncourt by raising his stick at a loafer, who made insulting references to\nJean Jacques.  But as the sale drew to a close, an air of rollicking\nhumour among the younger men would not be suppressed, and it looked as\nthough Jean Jacques’ exit would be attended by the elements of farce and\nsatire.",
        "In this world, however, things do not happen logically, and Jean Jacques\nmade his exit in a wholly unexpected manner.  He was going away by the\ntrain which left a new railway junction a few miles off, having gently\nyet firmly declined M. Fille’s invitation, and also the invitations of\nothers–including the Cure and Mere Langlois–to spend the night with\nthem and start off the next day.  He elected to go on to Montreal that\nvery night, and before the sale was quite finished he prepared to start.\nHis carpet-bag containing a few clothes and necessaries had been sent on\nto the junction, and he meant to walk to the station in the cool of the\nevening.",
        "M. Manotel, the auctioneer, hoarse with his heavy day’s work, was\nannouncing that there were only a few more things to sell, and no doubt\nthey could be had at a bargain, when Jean Jacques began a tour of the\nManor.  There was something inexpressibly mournful in this lonely\npilgrimage of the dismantled mansion.  Yet there was no show of cheap\nemotion by Jean Jacques; and a wave of the hand prevented any one from\nfollowing him in his dry-eyed progress to say farewell to these haunts of\nchildhood, manhood, family, and home.  There was a strange numbness in\nhis mind and body, and he had a feeling that he moved immense and\nreflective among material things.  Only tragedy can produce that feeling.\nHappiness makes the universe infinite and stupendous, despair makes it\nsmall and even trivial.",
        "It was when he had reached the little office where he had done the\nbusiness of his life–a kind of neutral place where he had ever isolated\nhimself from the domestic scene–that the final sensation, save one, of\nhis existence at the Manor came to him.  Virginie Poucette had divined\nhis purpose when he began the tour of the house, and going by a\nroundabout way, she had placed herself where she could speak with him\nalone before he left the place for ever–if that was to be.  She was not\nsure that his exit was really inevitable–not yet.",
        "When Jean Jacques saw Virginie standing beside the table in his office\nwhere he lead worked over so many years, now marked Sold, and waiting to\nbe taken away by its new owner, he started and drew back, but she held\nout her hand and said:",
        "“But one word, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques; only one word from a friend–indeed\na friend.”",
        "“A friend of friends,” he answered, still in abstraction, his eyes having\nthat burnished light which belonged to the night of the fire; but yet\nrealizing that she was a sympathetic soul who had offered to lend him\nmoney without security.",
        "“Oh, indeed yes, as good a friend as you can ever have!” she added.",
        "Something had waked the bigger part of her, which had never been awake in\nthe days of Palass Poucette.  Jean Jacques was much older than she, but\nwhat she felt had nothing to do with age, or place or station.  It had\nonly to do with understanding, with the call of nature and of a\nmotherhood crying for expression.  Her heart ached for him.",
        "“Well, good-bye, my friend,” he said, and held out his hand.  “I must be\ngoing now.”",
        "“Wait,” she said, and there was something insistent and yet pleading in\nher voice.  “I’ve got something to say.  You must hear it.  .  .  .  Why\nshould you go?  There is my farm–it needs to be worked right.  It has\ngot good chances.  It has water-power and wood and the best flax in the\nprovince–they want to start a flax-mill on it–I’ve had letters from big\nmen in Montreal.  Well, why shouldn’t you do it instead?  There it is,\nthe farm, and there am I a woman alone.  I need help.  I’ve got no head.\nI have to work at a sum of figures all night to get it straight.  .  .  .\nAh, m’sieu’, it is a need both sides!  You want someone to look after\nyou; you want a chance again to do things; but you want someone to look\nafter you, and it is all waiting there on the farm.  Palass Poucette left\nbehind him seven sound horses, and cows and sheep, and a threshing-\nmachine and a fanning-mill, and no debts, and two thousand dollars in the\nbank.  You will never do anything away from here.  You must stay here,\nwhere–where I can look after you, Jean Jacques.”",
        "The light in his eyes flamed up, died down, flamed up again, and\npresently it covered all his face, as he grasped what she meant.",
        "“Wonder of God, do you forget?” he asked.  “I am married–married still,\nVirginie Poucette.  There is no divorce in the Catholic Church–no, none\nat all.  It is for ever and ever.”",
        "“I said nothing about marriage,” she said bravely, though her face\nsuffused.",
        "“Hand of Heaven, what do you mean?  You mean to say you would do that for\nme in spite of the Cure and–and everybody and everything?”",
        "“You ought to be taken care of,” she protested.  “You ought to have your\nchance again.  No one here is free to do it all but me.  You are alone.\nYour wife that was–maybe she is dead.  I am alone, and I’m not afraid of\nwhat the good God will say.  I will settle with Him myself.  Well, then,\ndo you think I’d care what–what Mere Langlois or the rest of the world\nwould say?  .  .  .  I can’t bear to think of you going away with\nnothing, with nobody, when here is something and somebody–somebody\nwho would be good to you.  Everybody knows that you’ve been badly used–\neverybody.  I’m young enough to make things bright and warm in your life,\nand the place is big enough for two, even if it isn’t the Manor Cartier.”",
        "“Figure de Christ, do you think I’d let you do it–me?” declared Jean\nJacques, with lips trembling now and his shoulders heaving.  Misfortune\nand pain and penalty he could stand, but sacrifice like this and–and\nwhatever else it was, were too much for him.  They brought him back to\nthe dusty road and everyday life again; they subtracted him from his big\ndream, in which he had been detached from the details of his catastrophe.",
        "“No, no, no,” he added.  “You go look another way, Virginie.  Turn your\nface to the young spring, not to the dead winter.  To-morrow I’ll be gone\nto find what I’ve got to find.  I’ve finished here, but there’s many a\ngood man waiting for you–men who’ll bring you something worth while\nbesides themselves.  Make no mistake, I’ve finished.  I’ve done my term\nof life.  I’m only out on ticket-of-leave now–but there, enough, I shall\nalways want to think of you.  I wish I had something to give you–but\nyes, here is something.”  He drew from his pocket a silver napkin-ring.\n“I’ve had that since I was five years old.  My uncle Stefan gave it to\nme.  I’ve always used it.  I don’t know why I put it in my pocket this\nmorning, but I did.  Take it.  It’s more than money.  It’s got something\nof Jean Jacques about it.  You’ve got the Barbille fruit-dish-that is a\nthing I’ll remember.  I’m glad you’ve got it, and–”",
        "“I meant we should both eat from it,” she said helplessly.",
        "“It would cost too much to eat from it with you, Virginie–”",
        "He stopped short, choked, then his face cleared, and his eyes became\nsteady.",
        "“Well then, good-bye, Virginie,” he said, holding out his hand.",
        "“You don’t think I’d say to any other living man what I’ve said to you?\"\nshe asked.",
        "He nodded understandingly.  “That’s the best part of it.  It was for me\nof all the world,” he answered.  “When I look back, I’ll see the light\nin your window–the light you lit for the lost one–for Jean Jacques\nBarbille.”",
        "Suddenly, with eyes that did not see and hands held out before him, he\nturned, felt for the door and left the room.",
        "She leaned helplessly against the table.  “The poor Jean Jacques–the\npoor Jean Jacques!” she murmured.  “Cure or no Cure, I’d have done it,\"\nshe declared, with a ring to her voice.  “Ah, but Jean Jacques, come with\nme!” she added with a hungry and compassionate gesture, speaking into\nspace.  “I could make life worth while for us both.”",
        "A moment later Virginie was outside, watching the last act in the career\nof Jean Jacques in the parish of St. Saviour’s.",
        "This was what she saw.",
        "The auctioneer was holding up a bird-cage containing a canary-Carmen’s\nbird-cage, and Zoe’s canary which had remained to be a vocal memory of\nher in her old home.",
        "“Here,” said the rhetorical, inflammable auctioneer, “here is the\nchoicest lot left to the last.  I put it away in the bakery, meaning to\nsell it at noon, when everybody was eating-food for the soul and food for\nthe body.  I forgot it.  But here it is, worth anything you like to\nanybody that loves the beautiful, the good, and the harmonious.  What do\nI hear for this lovely saffron singer from the Elysian fields?  What did\nthe immortal poet of France say of the bird in his garret, in ’L’Oiseau\nde Mon Crenier’?  What did he say:",
        "                   ’Sing me a song of the bygone hour,\n                    A song of the stream and the sun;\n                    Sing of my love in her bosky bower,\n                    When my heart it was twenty-one.’",
        "“Come now, who will renew his age or regale her youth with the divine\nnotes of nature’s minstrel?  Who will make me an offer for this vestal\nvirgin of song–the joy of the morning and the benediction of the\nevening?  What do I hear?  The best of the wine to the last of the feast!\nWhat do I hear?–five dollars–seven dollars–nine dollars–going at nine\ndollars–ten dollars–Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bird can sing–ah,\nvoila !”",
        "He stopped short for a moment, for as the evening sun swept its veil of\nrainbow radiance over the scene, the bird began to sing.  Its little\nthroat swelled, it chirruped, it trilled, it called, it soared, it lost\nitself in a flood of ecstasy.  In the applausive silence, the emotional\nrecess of the sale, as it were, the man to whom the bird and the song\nmeant most, pushed his way up to the stand where M. Manotel stood.  When\nthe people saw who it was, they fell back, for there was that in his face\nwhich needed no interpretation.  It filled them with a kind of awe.",
        "He reached up a brown, eager, affectionate hand–it had always been that\n–fat and small, but rather fine and certainly emotional, though not\nmaterial or sensual.",
        "“Go on with your bidding,” he said.",
        "He was going to buy the thing which had belonged to his daughter, was\nbeloved by her–the living oracle of the morning, the muezzin of his\nmosque of home.  It had been to the girl who had gone as another such a\nbird had been to the mother of the girl, the voice that sang, “Praise\nGod,” in the short summer of that bygone happiness of his.  Even this\ncage and its homebird were not his; they belonged to the creditors.",
        "“Go on.  I buy–I bid,” Jean Jacques said in a voice that rang.  It had\nno blur of emotion.  It had resonance.  The hammer that struck the bell\nof his voice was the hammer of memory, and if it was plaintive it also\nwas clear, and it was also vibrant with the silver of lost hopes.",
        "M. Manotel humoured him, while the bird still sang.  “Four dollars–five\ndollars: do I hear no more than five dollars?–going once, going twice,\ngoing three times–gone!” he cried, for no one had made a further bid;\nand indeed M. Manotel would not have heard another voice than Jean\nJacques’ if it had been as loud as the falls of the Saguenay.  He was a\nkind of poet in his way, was M. Manotel.  He had been married four times,\nand he would be married again if he had the chance; also he wrote verses\nfor tombstones in the churchyard at St. Saviour’s, and couplets for fetes\nand weddings.",
        "He handed the cage to Jean Jacques, who put it down on the ground at his\nfeet, and in an instant had handed up five dollars for one of the idols\nof his own altar.  Anyone else than M. Manotel, or perhaps M. Fille or\nthe New Cure, would have hesitated to take the five dollars, or, if they\nhad done so, would have handed it back; but they had souls to understand\nthis Jean Jacques, and they would not deny him his insistent\nindependence.  And so, in a moment, he was making his way out of the\ncrowd with the cage in his hand, the bird silent now.",
        "As he went, some one touched his arm and slipped a book into his hand.\nIt was M. Fille, and the book was his little compendium of philosophy\nwhich his friend had retrieved from his bedroom in the early morning.",
        "“You weren’t going to forget it, Jean Jacques?” M. Fille said\nreproachfully.  “It is an old friend.  It would not be happy with\nany one else.”",
        "Jean Jacques looked M. Fille in the eyes.  “Moi–je suis philosophe,” he\nsaid without any of the old insistence and pride and egotism, but as one\nwould make an affirmation or repeat a creed.",
        "“Yes, yes, to be sure, always, as of old,” answered M. Fille firmly;\nfor, from that formula might come strength, when it was most needed,\nin a sense other and deeper far than it had been or was now.  “You will\nremember that you will always know where to find us–eh?” added the\nlittle Clerk of the Court.",
        "The going of Jean Jacques was inevitable; all persuasion had failed to\ninduce him to stay–even that of Virginie; and M. Fille now treated it\nas though it was the beginning of a new career for Jean Jacques, whatever\nthat career might be.  It might be he would come back some day, but not\nto things as they were, not ever again, nor as the same man.",
        "“You will move on with the world outside there,” continued M. Fille,\n“but we shall be turning on the same swivel here always; and whenever you\ncome–there, you understand.  With us it is semper fidelis, always the\nsame.”",
        "Jean Jacques looked at M. Fille again as though to ask him a question,\nbut presently he shook his head in negation to his thought.",
        "“Well, good-bye,” he said cheerfully–\"A la bonne heure!”",
        "By that M. Fille knew that Jean Jacques did not wish for company as he\nwent–not even the company of his old friend who had loved the bright\nwhimsical emotional Zoe; who had hovered around his life like a\nprotecting spirit.",
        "“A bi’tot,” responded M. Fille, declining upon the homely patois.",
        "But as Jean Jacques walked away with his little book of philosophy in his\npocket, and the bird-cage in his hand, someone sobbed.  M. Fille turned\nand saw.  It was Virginie Poucette.  Fortunately for Virginie other women\ndid the same, not for the same reason, but out of a sympathy which was\npart of the scene.",
        "It had been the intention of some friends of Jean Jacques to give him\na cheer when he left, and even his sullen local creditors, now that the\nworst had come, were disposed to give him a good send-off; but the\nincident of the canary in its cage gave a turn to the feeling of the\ncrowd which could not be resisted.  They were not a people who could cut\nand dry their sentiments; they were all impulse and simplicity, with an\nobvious cocksure shrewdness too, like that of Jean Jacques–of the old\nJean Jacques.  He had been the epitome of all their faults and all their\nvirtues.",
        "No one cheered.  Only one person called, “Au ’voir, M’sieu’ Jean\nJacques!” and no one followed him–a curious, assertive, feebly-brisk,\nshock-headed figure in the brown velveteen jacket, which he had bought in\nParis on his Grand Tour.",
        "“What a ridiculous little man!” said a woman from Chalfonte over the\nwater, who had been buying freely all day for her new “Manor,” her\nhusband being a member of the provincial legislature.",
        "The words were no sooner out of her mouth than two women faced her\nthreateningly.",
        "“For two pins I’d slap your face,” said old Mere Langlois, her great\nbreast heaving.  “Popinjay–you, that ought to be in a cage like his\ncanary.”",
        "But Virginie Poucette also was there in front of the offender, and she\nalso had come from Chalfonte–was born in that parish; and she knew what\nshe was facing.",
        "“Better carry a bird-cage and a book than carry swill to swine,” she\nsaid; and madame from Chalfonte turned white, for it had been said that\nher father was once a swine-herd, and that she had tried her best to\nforget it when, with her coarse beauty, she married the well-to-do\nfarmer who was now in the legislature.",
        "“Hold your tongues, all of you, and look at that,” said M. Manotel, who\nhad joined the agitated group.  He was pointing towards the departing\nJean Jacques, who was now away upon his road.",
        "Jean Jacques had raised the cage on a level with his face, and was\nevidently speaking to the bird in the way birds love–that soft kissing\nsound to which they reply with song.",
        "Presently there came a chirp or two, and then the bird thrust up its\nhead, and out came the full blessedness of its song, exultant, home-like,\nintimate.",
        "Jean Jacques walked on, the bird singing by his side; and he did not look\nback.",
