        "AFTER the 32nd chapter of TREASURE ISLAND, two of the puppets \nstrolled out to have a pipe before business should begin again, and \nmet in an open place not far from the story.",
        "“Good-morning, Cap’n,” said the first, with a man-o’-war salute, \nand a beaming countenance.",
        "“Ah, Silver!” grunted the other.  “You’re in a bad way, Silver.”",
        "“Now, Cap’n Smollett,” remonstrated Silver, “dooty is dooty, as I \nknows, and none better; but we’re off dooty now; and I can’t see no \ncall to keep up the morality business.”",
        "“You’re a damned rogue, my man,” said the Captain.",
        "“Come, come, Cap’n, be just,” returned the other.  “There’s no call \nto be angry with me in earnest.  I’m on’y a chara’ter in a sea \nstory.  I don’t really exist.”",
        "“Well, I don’t really exist either,” says the Captain, “which seems \nto meet that.”",
        "“I wouldn’t set no limits to what a virtuous chara’ter might \nconsider argument,” responded Silver.  “But I’m the villain of this \ntale, I am; and speaking as one sea-faring man to another, what I \nwant to know is, what’s the odds?”",
        "“Were you never taught your catechism?” said the Captain.  “Don’t \nyou know there’s such a thing as an Author?”",
        "“Such a thing as a Author?” returned John, derisively.  “And who \nbetter’n me?  And the p’int is, if the Author made you, he made \nLong John, and he made Hands, and Pew, and George Merry - not that \nGeorge is up to much, for he’s little more’n a name; and he made \nFlint, what there is of him; and he made this here mutiny, you keep \nsuch a work about; and he had Tom Redruth shot; and - well, if \nthat’s a Author, give me Pew!”",
        "“Don’t you believe in a future state?” said Smollett.  “Do you \nthink there’s nothing but the present story-paper?”",
        "“I don’t rightly know for that,” said Silver; “and I don’t see what \nit’s got to do with it, anyway.  What I know is this: if there is \nsich a thing as a Author, I’m his favourite chara’ter.  He does me \nfathoms better’n he does you - fathoms, he does.  And he likes \ndoing me.  He keeps me on deck mostly all the time, crutch and all; \nand he leaves you measling in the hold, where nobody can’t see you, \nnor wants to, and you may lay to that!  If there is a Author, by \nthunder, but he’s on my side, and you may lay to it!”",
        "“I see he’s giving you a long rope,” said the Captain.  “But that \ncan’t change a man’s convictions.  I know the Author respects me; I \nfeel it in my bones; when you and I had that talk at the blockhouse \ndoor, who do you think he was for, my man?”",
        "“And don’t he respect me?” cried Silver.  “Ah, you should ’a’ heard \nme putting down my mutiny, George Merry and Morgan and that lot, no \nlonger ago’n last chapter; you’d heard something then!  You’d ’a’ \nseen what the Author thinks o’ me!  But come now, do you consider \nyourself a virtuous chara’ter clean through?”",
        "“God forbid!” said Captain Smollett, solemnly.  “I am a man that \ntries to do his duty, and makes a mess of it as often as not.  I’m \nnot a very popular man at home, Silver, I’m afraid!” and the \nCaptain sighed.",
        "“Ah,” says Silver.  “Then how about this sequel of yours?  Are you \nto be Cap’n Smollett just the same as ever, and not very popular at \nhome, says you?  And if so, why, it’s TREASURE ISLAND over again, \nby thunder; and I’ll be Long John, and Pew’ll be Pew, and we’ll \nhave another mutiny, as like as not.  Or are you to be somebody \nelse?  And if so, why, what the better are you? and what the worse \nam I?”",
        "“Why, look here, my man,” returned the Captain, “I can’t understand \nhow this story comes about at all, can I?  I can’t see how you and \nI, who don’t exist, should get to speaking here, and smoke our \npipes for all the world like reality?  Very well, then, who am I to \npipe up with my opinions?  I know the Author’s on the side of good; \nhe tells me so, it runs out of his pen as he writes.  Well, that’s \nall I need to know; I’ll take my chance upon the rest.”",
        "“It’s a fact he seemed to be against George Merry,” Silver \nadmitted, musingly.  “But George is little more’n a name at the \nbest of it,” he added, brightening.  “And to get into soundings for \nonce.  What is this good?  I made a mutiny, and I been a gentleman \no’ fortune; well, but by all stories, you ain’t no such saint.  I’m \na man that keeps company very easy; even by your own account, you \nain’t, and to my certain knowledge you’re a devil to haze.  Which \nis which?  Which is good, and which bad?  Ah, you tell me that!  \nHere we are in stays, and you may lay to it!”",
        "“We’re none of us perfect,” replied the Captain.  “That’s a fact of \nreligion, my man.  All I can say is, I try to do my duty; and if \nyou try to do yours, I can’t compliment you on your success.”",
        "“And so you was the judge, was you?” said Silver, derisively.",
        "“I would be both judge and hangman for you, my man, and never turn \na hair,” returned the Captain.  “But I get beyond that: it mayn’t \nbe sound theology, but it’s common sense, that what is good is \nuseful too - or there and thereabout, for I don’t set up to be a \nthinker.  Now, where would a story go to if there were no virtuous \ncharacters?”",
        "“If you go to that,” replied Silver, “where would a story begin, if \nthere wasn’t no villains?”",
        "“Well, that’s pretty much my thought,” said Captain Smollett.  “The \nAuthor has to get a story; that’s what he wants; and to get a \nstory, and to have a man like the doctor (say) given a proper \nchance, he has to put in men like you and Hands.  But he’s on the \nright side; and you mind your eye ! You’re not through this story \nyet; there’s trouble coming for you.”",
        "“What’ll you bet?” asked John.",
        "“Much I care if there ain’t,” returned the Captain.  “I’m glad \nenough to be Alexander Smollett, bad as he is; and I thank my stars \nupon my knees that I’m not Silver.  But there’s the ink-bottle \nopening.  To quarters!”",
        "And indeed the Author was just then beginning to write the words:",
        "CHAPTER XXXIII.",
        "“SIR,” said the first lieutenant, bursting into the Captain’s \ncabin, “the ship is going down.”",
        "“Very well, Mr. Spoker,” said the Captain; “but that is no reason \nfor going about half-shaved.  Exercise your mind a moment, Mr. \nSpoker, and you will see that to the philosophic eye there is \nnothing new in our position: the ship (if she is to go down at all) \nmay be said to have been going down since she was launched.”",
        "“She is settling fast,” said the first lieutenant, as he returned \nfrom shaving.",
        "“Fast, Mr. Spoker?” asked the Captain.  “The expression is a \nstrange one, for time (if you will think of it) is only relative.”",
        "“Sir,” said the lieutenant, “I think it is scarcely worth while to \nembark in such a discussion when we shall all be in Davy Jones’s \nLocker in ten minutes.”",
        "“By parity of reasoning,” returned the Captain gently, “it would \nnever be worth while to begin any inquiry of importance; the odds \nare always overwhelming that we must die before we shall have \nbrought it to an end.  You have not considered, Mr. Spoker, the \nsituation of man,” said the Captain, smiling, and shaking his head.",
        "“I am much more engaged in considering the position of the ship,” \nsaid Mr. Spoker.",
        "“Spoken like a good officer,” replied the Captain, laying his hand \non the lieutenant’s shoulder.",
        "On deck they found the men had broken into the spirit-room, and \nwere fast getting drunk.",
        "“My men,” said the Captain, “there is no sense in this.  The ship \nis going down, you will tell me, in ten minutes: well, and what \nthen?  To the philosophic eye, there is nothing new in our \nposition.  All our lives long, we may have been about to break a \nblood-vessel or to be struck by lightning, not merely in ten \nminutes, but in ten seconds; and that has not prevented us from \neating dinner, no, nor from putting money in the Savings Bank.  I \nassure you, with my hand on my heart, I fail to comprehend your \nattitude.”",
        "The men were already too far gone to pay much heed.",
        "“This is a very painful sight, Mr. Spoker,” said the Captain.",
        "“And yet to the philosophic eye, or whatever it is,” replied the \nfirst lieutenant, “they may be said to have been getting drunk \nsince they came aboard.”",
        "“I do not know if you always follow my thought, Mr. Spoker,” \nreturned the Captain gently.  “But let us proceed.”",
        "In the powder magazine they found an old salt smoking his pipe.",
        "“Good God,” cried the Captain, “what are you about?”",
        "“Well, sir,” said the old salt, apologetically, “they told me as \nshe were going down.”",
        "“And suppose she were?” said the Captain.  “To the philosophic eye, \nthere would be nothing new in our position.  Life, my old shipmate, \nlife, at any moment and in any view, is as dangerous as a sinking \nship; and yet it is man’s handsome fashion to carry umbrellas, to \nwear indiarubber over-shoes, to begin vast works, and to conduct \nhimself in every way as if he might hope to be eternal.  And for my \nown poor part I should despise the man who, even on board a sinking \nship, should omit to take a pill or to wind up his watch.  That, my \nfriend, would not be the human attitude.”",
        "“I beg pardon, sir,” said Mr. Spoker.  “But what is precisely the \ndifference between shaving in a sinking ship and smoking in a \npowder magazine?”",
        "“Or doing anything at all in any conceivable circumstances?” cried \nthe Captain.  “Perfectly conclusive; give me a cigar!”",
        "Two minutes afterwards the ship blew up with a glorious detonation.",
        "ONE day there was a traveller in the woods in California, in the \ndry season, when the Trades were blowing strong.  He had ridden a \nlong way, and he was tired and hungry, and dismounted from his \nhorse to smoke a pipe.  But when he felt in his pocket he found but \ntwo matches.  He struck the first, and it would not light.",
        "“Here is a pretty state of things!” said the traveller.  “Dying for \na smoke; only one match left; and that certain to miss fire!  Was \nthere ever a creature so unfortunate?  And yet,” thought the \ntraveller, “suppose I light this match, and smoke my pipe, and \nshake out the dottle here in the grass - the grass might catch on \nfire, for it is dry like tinder; and while I snatch out the flames \nin front, they might evade and run behind me, and seize upon yon \nbush of poison oak; before I could reach it, that would have blazed \nup; over the bush I see a pine tree hung with moss; that too would \nfly in fire upon the instant to its topmost bough; and the flame of \nthat long torch - how would the trade wind take and brandish that \nthrough the inflammable forest!  I hear this dell roar in a moment \nwith the joint voice of wind and fire, I see myself gallop for my \nsoul, and the flying conflagration chase and outflank me through \nthe hills; I see this pleasant forest burn for days, and the cattle \nroasted, and the springs dried up, and the farmer ruined, and his \nchildren cast upon the world.  What a world hangs upon this \nmoment!”",
        "With that he struck the match, and it missed fire.",
        "“Thank God!” said the traveller, and put his pipe in his pocket.",
        "THERE was once a sick man in a burning house, to whom there entered \na fireman.",
        "“Do not save me,” said the sick man.  “Save those who are strong.”",
        "“Will you kindly tell me why?” inquired the fireman, for he was a \ncivil fellow.",
        "“Nothing could possibly be fairer,” said the sick man.  “The strong \nshould be preferred in all cases, because they are of more service \nin the world.”",
        "The fireman pondered a while, for he was a man of some philosophy.  \n\"Granted,” said he at last, as apart of the roof fell in; “but for \nthe sake of conversation, what would you lay down as the proper \nservice of the strong?”",
        "“Nothing can possibly be easier,” returned the sick man; “the \nproper service of the strong is to help the weak.”",
        "Again the fireman reflected, for there was nothing hasty about this \nexcellent creature.  “I could forgive you being sick,” he said at \nlast, as a portion of the wall fell out, “but I cannot bear your \nbeing such a fool.”  And with that he heaved up his fireman’s axe, \nfor he was eminently just, and clove the sick man to the bed.",
        "ONCE upon a time the devil stayed at an inn, where no one knew him, \nfor they were people whose education had been neglected.  He was \nbent on mischief, and for a time kept everybody by the ears.  But \nat last the innkeeper set a watch upon the devil and took him in \nthe fact.",
        "The innkeeper got a rope’s end.",
        "“Now I am going to thrash you,” said the innkeeper.",
        "“You have no right to be angry with me,” said the devil.  “I am \nonly the devil, and it is my nature to do wrong.”",
        "“Is that so?” asked the innkeeper.",
        "“Fact, I assure you,” said the devil.",
        "“You really cannot help doing ill?” asked the innkeeper.",
        "“Not in the smallest,” said the devil; “it would be useless cruelty \nto thrash a thing like me.”",
        "“It would indeed,” said the innkeeper.",
        "And he made a noose and hanged the devil.",
        "“There!” said the innkeeper.",
        "A MAN met a lad weeping.  “What do you weep for?” he asked.",
        "“I am weeping for my sins,” said the lad.",
        "“You must have little to do,” said the man.",
        "The next day they met again.  Once more the lad was weeping.  “Why \ndo you weep now?” asked the man.",
        "“I am weeping because I have nothing to eat,” said the lad.",
        "“I thought it would come to that,” said the man.",
        "IN a certain city there lived a physician who sold yellow paint.  \nThis was of so singular a virtue that whoso was bedaubed with it \nfrom head to heel was set free from the dangers of life, and the \nbondage of sin, and the fear of death for ever.  So the physician \nsaid in his prospectus; and so said all the citizens in the city; \nand there was nothing more urgent in men’s hearts than to be \nproperly painted themselves, and nothing they took more delight in \nthan to see others painted.  There was in the same city a young man \nof a very good family but of a somewhat reckless life, who had \nreached the age of manhood, and would have nothing to say to the \npaint: “To-morrow was soon enough,” said he; and when the morrow \ncame he would still put it off.  She might have continued to do \nuntil his death; only, he had a friend of about his own age and \nmuch of his own manners; and this youth, taking a walk in the \npublic street, with not one fleck of paint upon his body, was \nsuddenly run down by a water-cart and cut off in the heyday of his \nnakedness.  This shook the other to the soul; so that I never \nbeheld a man more earnest to be painted; and on the very same \nevening, in the presence of all his family, to appropriate music, \nand himself weeping aloud, he received three complete coats and a \ntouch of varnish on the top.  The physician (who was himself \naffected even to tears) protested he had never done a job so \nthorough.",
        "Some two months afterwards, the young man was carried on a \nstretcher to the physician’s house.",
        "“What is the meaning of this?” he cried, as soon as the door was \nopened.  “I was to be set free from all the dangers of life; and \nhere have I been run down by that self-same water-cart, and my leg \nis broken.”",
        "“Dear me!” said the physician.  “This is very sad.  But I perceive \nI must explain to you the action of my paint.  A broken bone is a \nmighty small affair at the worst of it; and it belongs to a class \nof accident to which my paint is quite inapplicable.  Sin, my dear \nyoung friend, sin is the sole calamity that a wise man should \napprehend; it is against sin that I have fitted you out; and when \nyou come to be tempted, you will give me news of my paint.”",
        "“Oh!” said the young man, “I did not understand that, and it seems \nrather disappointing.  But I have no doubt all is for the best; and \nin the meanwhile, I shall be obliged to you if you will set my \nleg.”",
        "“That is none of my business,” said the physician; “but if your \nbearers will carry you round the corner to the surgeon’s, I feel \nsure he will afford relief.”",
        "Some three years later, the young man came running to the \nphysician’s house in a great perturbation.  “What is the meaning of \nthis?” he cried.  “Here was I to be set free from the bondage of \nsin; and I have just committed forgery, arson and murder.”",
        "“Dear me,” said the physician.  “This is very serious.  Off with \nyour clothes at once.”  And as soon as the young man had stripped, \nhe examined him from head to foot.  “No,” he cried with great \nrelief, “there is not a flake broken.  Cheer up, my young friend, \nyour paint is as good as new.”",
        "“Good God!” cried the young man, “and what then can be the use of \nit?”",
        "“Why,” said the physician, “I perceive I must explain to you the \nnature of the action of my paint.  It does not exactly prevent sin; \nit extenuates instead the painful consequences.  It is not so much \nfor this world, as for the next; it is not against life; in short, \nit is against death that I have fitted you out.  And when you come \nto die, you will give me news of my paint.”",
        "“Oh!” cried the young man, “I had not understood that, and it seems \na little disappointing.  But there is no doubt all is for the best: \nand in the meanwhile, I shall be obliged if you will help me to \nundo the evil I have brought on innocent persons.”",
        "“That is none of my business,” said the physician; “but if you will \ngo round the corner to the police office, I feel sure it will \nafford you relief to give yourself up.”",
        "Six weeks later, the physician was called to the town gaol.",
        "“What is the meaning of this?” cried the young man.  “Here am I \nliterally crusted with your paint; and I have broken my leg, and \ncommitted all the crimes in the calendar, and must be hanged to-\nmorrow; and am in the meanwhile in a fear so extreme that I lack \nwords to picture it.”",
        "“Dear me,” said the physician.  “This is really amazing.  Well, \nwell; perhaps, if you had not been painted, you would have been \nmore frightened still.”",
        "So soon as the child began to speak, the gyve was riveted; and the \nboys and girls limped about their play like convicts.  Doubtless it \nwas more pitiable to see and more painful to bear in youth; but \neven the grown folk, besides being very unhandy on their feet, were \noften sick with ulcers.",
        "About the time when Jack was ten years old, many strangers began to \njourney through that country.  These he beheld going lightly by on \nthe long roads, and the thing amazed him.  “I wonder how it comes,” \nhe asked, “that all these strangers are so quick afoot, and we must \ndrag about our fetter?”",
        "“My dear boy,” said his uncle, the catechist, “do not complain \nabout your fetter, for it is the only thing that makes life worth \nliving.  None are happy, none are good, none are respectable, that \nare not gyved like us.  And I must tell you, besides, it is very \ndangerous talk.  If you grumble of your iron, you will have no \nluck; if ever you take it off, you will be instantly smitten by a \nthunderbolt.”",
        "“Are there no thunderbolts for these strangers?” asked Jack.",
        "“Jupiter is longsuffering to the benighted,” returned the \ncatechist.",
        "“Upon my word, I could wish I had been less fortunate,” said Jack.  \n\"For if I had been born benighted, I might now be going free; and \nit cannot be denied the iron is inconvenient, and the ulcer hurts.”",
        "“Ah!” cried his uncle, “do not envy the heathen!  Theirs is a sad \nlot!  Ah, poor souls, if they but knew the joys of being fettered!  \nPoor souls, my heart yearns for them.  But the truth is they are \nvile, odious, insolent, ill-conditioned, stinking brutes, not truly \nhuman - for what is a man without a fetter? - and you cannot be too \nparticular not to touch or speak with them.”",
        "After this talk, the child would never pass one of the unfettered \non the road but what he spat at him and called him names, which was \nthe practice of the children in that part.",
        "It chanced one day, when he was fifteen, he went into the woods, \nand the ulcer pained him.  It was a fair day, with a blue sky; all \nthe birds were singing; but Jack nursed his foot.  Presently, \nanother song began; it sounded like the singing of a person, only \nfar more gay; at the same time there was a beating on the earth.  \nJack put aside the leaves; and there was a lad of his own village, \nleaping, and dancing and singing to himself in a green dell; and on \nthe grass beside him lay the dancer’s iron.",
        "“Oh!” cried Jack, “you have your fetter off!”",
        "“For God’s sake, don’t tell your uncle!” cried the lad.",
        "“If you fear my uncle,” returned Jack “why do you not fear the \nthunderbolt”?",
        "“That is only an old wives’ tale,” said the other.  “It is only \ntold to children.  Scores of us come here among the woods and dance \nfor nights together, and are none the worse.”",
        "This put Jack in a thousand new thoughts.  He was a grave lad; he \nhad no mind to dance himself; he wore his fetter manfully, and \ntended his ulcer without complaint.  But he loved the less to be \ndeceived or to see others cheated.  He began to lie in wait for \nheathen travellers, at covert parts of the road, and in the dusk of \nthe day, so that he might speak with them unseen; and these were \ngreatly taken with their wayside questioner, and told him things of \nweight.  The wearing of gyves (they said) was no command of \nJupiter’s.  It was the contrivance of a white-faced thing, a \nsorcerer, that dwelt in that country in the Wood of Eld.  He was \none like Glaucus that could change his shape, yet he could be \nalways told; for when he was crossed, he gobbled like a turkey.  He \nhad three lives; but the third smiting would make an end of him \nindeed; and with that his house of sorcery would vanish, the gyves \nfall, and the villagers take hands and dance like children.",
        "“And in your country?” Jack would ask.",
        "But at this the travellers, with one accord, would put him off; \nuntil Jack began to suppose there was no land entirely happy.  Or, \nif there were, it must be one that kept its folk at home; which was \nnatural enough.",
        "But the case of the gyves weighed upon him.  The sight of the \nchildren limping stuck in his eyes; the groans of such as dressed \ntheir ulcers haunted him.  And it came at last in his mind that he \nwas born to free them.",
        "There was in that village a sword of heavenly forgery, beaten upon \nVulcan’s anvil.  It was never used but in the temple, and then the \nflat of it only; and it hung on a nail by the catechist’s chimney.  \nEarly one night, Jack rose, and took the sword, and was gone out of \nthe house and the village in the darkness.",
        "All night he walked at a venture; and when day came, he met \nstrangers going to the fields.  Then he asked after the Wood of Eld \nand the house of sorcery; and one said north, and one south; until \nJack saw that they deceived him.  So then, when he asked his way of \nany man, he showed the bright sword naked; and at that the gyve on \nthe man’s ankle rang, and answered in his stead; and the word was \nstill STRAIGHT ON.  But the man, when his gyve spoke, spat and \nstruck at Jack, and threw stones at him as he went away; so that \nhis head was broken.",
        "So he came to that wood, and entered in, and he was aware of a \nhouse in a low place, where funguses grew, and the trees met, and \nthe steaming of the marsh arose about it like a smoke.  It was a \nfine house, and a very rambling; some parts of it were ancient like \nthe hills, and some but of yesterday, and none finished; and all \nthe ends of it were open, so that you could go in from every side.  \nYet it was in good repair, and all the chimneys smoked.",
        "Jack went in through the gable; and there was one room after \nanother, all bare, but all furnished in part, so that a man could \ndwell there; and in each there was a fire burning, where a man \ncould warm himself, and a table spread where he might eat.  But \nJack saw nowhere any living creature; only the bodies of some \nstuffed.",
        "“This is a hospitable house,” said Jack; “but the ground must be \nquaggy underneath, for at every step the building quakes.”",
        "He had gone some time in the house, when he began to be hungry.  \nThen he looked at the food, and at first he was afraid; but he \nbared the sword, and by the shining of the sword, it seemed the \nfood was honest.  So he took the courage to sit down and eat, and \nhe was refreshed in mind and body.",
        "“This is strange,” thought he, “that in the house of sorcery there \nshould be food so wholesome.”",
        "As he was yet eating, there came into that room the appearance of \nhis uncle, and Jack was afraid because he had taken the sword.  But \nhis uncle was never more kind, and sat down to meat with him, and \npraised him because he had taken the sword.  Never had these two \nbeen more pleasantly together, and Jack was full of love to the \nman.",
        "“It was very well done,” said his uncle, “to take the sword and \ncome yourself into the House of Eld; a good thought and a brave \ndeed.  But now you are satisfied; and we may go home to dinner arm \nin arm.”",
        "“Oh, dear, no!” said Jack.  “I am not satisfied yet.”",
        "“How!” cried his uncle.  “Are you not warmed by the fire?  Does not \nthis food sustain you?”",
        "“I see the food to be wholesome,” said Jack; “and still it is no \nproof that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg.”",
        "Now at this the appearance of his uncle gobbled like a turkey.",
        "“Jupiter!” cried Jack, “is this the sorcerer?”",
        "His hand held back and his heart failed him for the love he bore \nhis uncle; but he heaved up the sword and smote the appearance on \nthe head; and it cried out aloud with the voice of his uncle; and \nfell to the ground; and a little bloodless white thing fled from \nthe room.",
        "The cry rang in Jack’s ears, and his knees smote together, and \nconscience cried upon him; and yet he was strengthened, and there \nwoke in his bones the lust of that enchanter’s blood.  “If the \ngyves are to fall,” said he, “I must go through with this, and when \nI get home I shall find my uncle dancing.”",
        "So he went on after the bloodless thing.  In the way, he met the \nappearance of his father; and his father was incensed, and railed \nupon him, and called to him upon his duty, and bade him be home, \nwhile there was yet time.  “For you can still,” said he, “be home \nby sunset; and then all will be forgiven.”",
        "“God knows,” said Jack, “I fear your anger; but yet your anger does \nnot prove that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg.”",
        "And at that the appearance of his father gobbled like a turkey.",
        "“Ah, heaven,” cried Jack, “the sorcerer again!”",
        "The blood ran backward in his body and his joints rebelled against \nhim for the love he bore his father; but he heaved up the sword, \nand plunged it in the heart of the appearance; and the appearance \ncried out aloud with the voice of his father; and fell to the \nground; and a little bloodless white thing fled from the room.",
        "The cry rang in Jack’s ears, and his soul was darkened; but now \nrage came to him.  “I have done what I dare not think upon,” said \nhe.  “I will go to an end with it, or perish.  And when I get home, \nI pray God this may be a dream, and I may find my father dancing.”",
        "So he went on after the bloodless thing that had escaped; and in \nthe way he met the appearance of his mother, and she wept.  “What \nhave you done?” she cried.  “What is this that you have done?  Oh, \ncome home (where you may be by bedtime) ere you do more ill to me \nand mine; for it is enough to smite my brother and your father.”",
        "“Dear mother, it is not these that I have smitten,” said Jack; “it \nwas but the enchanter in their shape.  And even if I had, it would \nnot prove that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg.”",
        "And at this the appearance gobbled like a turkey.",
        "He never knew how he did that; but he swung the sword on the one \nside, and clove the appearance through the midst; and it cried out \naloud with the voice of his mother; and fell to the ground; and \nwith the fall of it, the house was gone from over Jack’s head, and \nhe stood alone in the woods, and the gyve was loosened from his \nleg.",
        "“Well,” said he, “the enchanter is now dead, and the fetter gone.”  \nBut the cries rang in his soul, and the day was like night to him.  \n\"This has been a sore business,” said he.  “Let me get forth out of \nthe wood, and see the good that I have done to others.”",
        "He thought to leave the fetter where it lay, but when he turned to \ngo, his mind was otherwise.  So he stooped and put the gyve in his \nbosom; and the rough iron galled him as he went, and his bosom \nbled.",
        "Now when he was forth of the wood upon the highway, he met folk \nreturning from the field; and those he met had no fetter on the \nright leg, but, behold! they had one upon the left.  Jack asked \nthem what it signified; and they said, “that was the new wear, for \nthe old was found to be a superstition”.  Then he looked at them \nnearly; and there was a new ulcer on the left ankle, and the old \none on the right was not yet healed.",
        "“Now, may God forgive me!” cried Jack.  “I would I were well home.”",
        "And when he was home, there lay his uncle smitten on the head, and \nhis father pierced through the heart, and his mother cloven through \nthe midst.  And he sat in the lone house and wept beside the \nbodies.",

        "A little after, they both died, and came together before the great \nwhite Justice of the Peace.  It began to look black for the friend, \nbut the man for a while had a clear character and was getting in \ngood spirits.",
        "“I find here some record of a quarrel,” said the justice, looking \nin his notes.  “Which of you was in the wrong?”",
        "“He was,” said the man.  “He spoke ill of me behind my back.”",
        "“Did he so?” said the justice.  “And pray how did he speak about \nyour neighbours?”",

        "“They are not people at all,” said the philosopher.  “Come along.”",
        "Next they came through a meadow where there were cows.",
        "“These are very dirty people,” said the stranger.",
        "“They are not people at all,” said the philosopher; and he \nexplained what a cow is in scientific words which I have forgotten.",
        "“That is all one to me,” said the stranger.  “But why do they never \nlook up?”",
        "“Because they are graminivorous,” said the philosopher; “and to \nlive upon grass, which is not highly nutritious, requires so close \nan attention to business that they have no time to think, or speak, \nor look at the scenery, or keep themselves clean.”",
        "“Well,” said the stranger, “that is one way to live, no doubt.  But \nI prefer the people with the green heads.”",
        "Next they came into a city, and the streets were full of men and \nwomen.",

Now \nthe saddle-horse had never seen creatures so big.  “These must be \ngreat chiefs,” thought he, and he approached them civilly.  “Lady \nand gentleman,” said he, “I understand you are from the colonies.  \nI offer you my affectionate compliments, and make you heartily \nwelcome to the islands.”",

In particular, they warned him of \nthe house of yellow reeds tied with black sinnet, how any one who \ntouched it became instantly the prey of Akaanga, and was handed on \nto him by Miru the ruddy, and hocussed with the kava of the dead, \nand baked in the ovens and eaten by the eaters of the dead.",
        "“There is nothing in it,” said the missionary.",
        "There was a bay upon that island, a very fair bay to look upon; \nbut, by the native saying, it was death to bathe there.  “There is \nnothing in that,” said the missionary; and he came to the bay, and \nwent swimming.  Presently an eddy took him and bore him towards the \nreef.  “Oho!” thought the missionary, “it seems there is something \nin it after all.”  And he swam the harder, but the eddy carried him \naway.  “I do not care about this eddy,” said the missionary; and \neven as he said it, he was aware of a house raised on piles above \nthe sea; it was built of yellow reeds, one reed joined with \nanother, and the whole bound with black sinnet; a ladder led to the \ndoor, and all about the house hung calabashes.  He had never seen \nsuch a house, nor yet such calabashes; and the eddy set for the \nladder.  “This is singular,” said the missionary, “but there can be \nnothing in it.”  And he laid hold of the ladder and went up.  It \nwas a fine house; but there was no man there; and when the \nmissionary looked back he saw no island, only the heaving of the \nsea.  “It is strange about the island,” said the missionary, “but \nwho’s afraid? my stories are the true ones.”  And he laid hold of a \ncalabash, for he was one that loved curiosities.  Now he had no \nsooner laid hand upon the calabash than that which he handled, and \nthat which he saw and stood on, burst like a bubble and was gone; \nand night closed upon him, and the waters, and the meshes of the \nnet; and he wallowed there like a fish.",

        "Now the flaming of Akaanga’s torch drew near in the night; and the \nmisshapen hands groped in the meshes of the net; and they took the \nmissionary between the finger and the thumb, and bore him dripping \nin the night and silence to the place of the ovens of Miru.  And \nthere was Miru, ruddy in the glow of the ovens; and there sat her \nfour daughters, and made the kava of the dead; and there sat the \ncomers out of the islands of the living, dripping and lamenting.",
        "This was a dread place to reach for any of the sons of men.  But of \nall who ever came there, the missionary was the most concerned; \nand, to make things worse, the person next him was a convert of his \nown.",
        "“Aha,” said the convert, “so you are here like your neighbours?  \nAnd how about all your stories?”",
        "“It seems,” said the missionary, with bursting tears, “that there \nwas nothing in them.”",
        "By this the kava of the dead was ready, and the daughters of Miru \nbegan to intone in the old manner of singing.  “Gone are the green \nislands and the bright sea, the sun and the moon and the forty \nmillion stars, and life and love and hope.  Henceforth is no more, \nonly to sit in the night and silence, and see your friends \ndevoured; for life is a deceit, and the bandage is taken from your \neyes.”",
        "Now when the singing was done, one of the daughters came with the \nbowl.  Desire of that kava rose in the missionary’s bosom; he \nlusted for it like a swimmer for the land, or a bridegroom for his \nbride; and he reached out his hand, and took the bowl, and would \nhave drunk.  And then he remembered, and put it back.",
        "“Drink!” sang the daughter of Miru.",
        "“There is no kava like the kava of the dead, and to drink of it \nonce is the reward of living.”",
        "“I thank you.  It smells excellent,” said the missionary.  “But I \nam a blue-ribbon man myself; and though I am aware there is a \ndifference of opinion even in our own confession, I have always \nheld kava to be excluded.”",
        "“What!” cried the convert.  “Are you going to respect a taboo at a \ntime like this?  And you were always so opposed to taboos when you \nwere alive!”",
        "“To other people’s,” said the missionary.  “Never to my own.”",
        "“But yours have all proved wrong,” said the convert.",
        "“It looks like it,” said the missionary, “and I can’t help that.  \nNo reason why I should break my word.”",
        "“I never heard the like of this!” cried the daughter of Miru.  \n\"Pray, what do you expect to gain?”",
        "“That is not the point,” said the missionary.  “I took this pledge \nfor others, I am not going to break it for myself.”",
        "The daughter of Miru was puzzled; she came and told her mother, and \nMiru was vexed; and they went and told Akaanga.  “I don’t know what \nto do about this,” said Akaanga; and he came and reasoned with the \nmissionary.",
        "“But there IS such a thing as right and wrong,” said the \nmissionary; “and your ovens cannot alter that.”",
        "“Give the kava to the rest,” said Akaanga to the daughters of Miru.  \n\"I must get rid of this sea-lawyer instantly, or worse will come of \nit.”",
        "The next moment the missionary came up in the midst of the sea, and \nthere before him were the palm trees of the island.  He swam to the \nshore gladly, and landed.  Much matter of thought was in that \nmissionary’s mind.",
        "“I seem to have been misinformed upon some points,” said he.  \n\"Perhaps there is not much in it, as I supposed; but there is \nsomething in it after all.  Let me be glad of that.”",
        "And he rang the bell for service.",
        "MORAL.",
        "IN the ancient days there went three men upon pilgrimage; one was a \npriest, and one was a virtuous person, and the third was an old \nrover with his axe.",
        "As they went, the priest spoke about the grounds of faith.",
        "“We find the proofs of our religion in the works of nature,” said \nhe, and beat his breast.",
        "“That is true,” said the virtuous person.",
        "“The peacock has a scrannel voice,” said the priest, “as has been \nlaid down always in our books.  How cheering!” he cried, in a voice \nlike one that wept.  “How comforting!”",
        "“I require no such proofs,” said the virtuous person.",
        "“Then you have no reasonable faith,” said the priest.",
        "“Great is the right, and shall prevail!” cried the virtuous person.  \n\"There is loyalty in my soul; be sure, there is loyalty in the mind \nof Odin.”",
        "“These are but playings upon words,” returned the priest.  “A \nsackful of such trash is nothing to the peacock.”",
        "Just then they passed a country farm, where there was a peacock \nseated on a rail; and the bird opened its mouth and sang with the \nvoice of a nightingale.",
        "“Where are you now?” asked the virtuous person.  “And yet this \nshakes not me!  Great is the truth, and shall prevail!”",
        "“The devil fly away with that peacock!” said the priest; and he was \ndowncast for a mile or two.",
        "But presently they came to a shrine, where a Fakeer performed \nmiracles.",
        "“Ah!” said the priest, “here are the true grounds of faith.  The \npeacock was but an adminicle.  This is the base of our religion.”",
        "And he beat upon his breast, and groaned like one with colic.",
        "“Now to me,” said the virtuous person, “all this is as little to \nthe purpose as the peacock.  I believe because I see the right is \ngreat and must prevail; and this Fakeer might carry on with his \nconjuring tricks till doomsday, and it would not play bluff upon a \nman like me.”",
        "Now at this the Fakeer was so much incensed that his hand trembled; \nand, lo! in the midst of a miracle the cards fell from up his \nsleeve.",
        "“Where are you now?” asked the virtuous person.  “And yet it shakes \nnot me!”",
        "“The devil fly away with the Fakeer!” cried the priest.  “I really \ndo not see the good of going on with this pilgrimage.”",
        "“Cheer up!” cried the virtuous person.  “Great is the right, and \nshall prevail!”",
        "“If you are quite sure it will prevail,” says the priest.",
        "“I pledge my word for that,” said the virtuous person.",
        "So the other began to go on again with a better heart.",
        "At last one came running, and told them all was lost: that the \npowers of darkness had besieged the Heavenly Mansions, that Odin \nwas to die, and evil triumph.",
        "“I have been grossly deceived,” cried the virtuous person.",
        "“All is lost now,” said the priest.",
        "“I wonder if it is too late to make it up with the devil?” said the \nvirtuous person.",
        "“Oh, I hope not,” said the priest.  “And at any rate we can but \ntry.  But what are you doing with your axe?” says he to the rover.",

        "But the elder son got to his feet, and called the King that was a \npriest by the name of father.  “For whether I marry the maid or no, \nI will call you by that word for the love of your wisdom; and even \nnow I will ride forth and search the world for the stone of touch.”  \nSo he said farewell, and rode into the world.",
        "“I think I will go, too,” said the younger son, “if I can have your \nleave.  For my heart goes out to the maid.”",
        "“You will ride home with me,” said his father.",
        "So they rode home, and when they came to the dun, the King had his \nson into his treasury.  “Here,” said he, “is the touchstone which \nshows truth; for there is no truth but plain truth; and if you will \nlook in this, you will see yourself as you are.”",
        "And the younger son looked in it, and saw his face as it were the \nface of a beardless youth, and he was well enough pleased; for the \nthing was a piece of a mirror.",
        "“Here is no such great thing to make a work about,” said he; “but \nif it will get me the maid I shall never complain.  But what a fool \nis my brother to ride into the world, and the thing all the while \nat home!”",
        "So they rode back to the other dun, and showed the mirror to the \nKing that was a priest; and when he had looked in it, and seen \nhimself like a King, and his house like a King’s house, and all \nthings like themselves, he cried out and blessed God.  “For now I \nknow,” said he, “there is no truth but the plain truth; and I am a \nKing indeed, although my heart misgave me.”  And he pulled down his \ntemple, and built a new one; and then the younger son was married \nto the maid.",
        "In the meantime the elder son rode into the world to find the \ntouchstone of the trial of truth; and whenever he came to a place \nof habitation, he would ask the men if they had heard of it.  And \nin every place the men answered: “Not only have we heard of it, but \nwe alone, of all men, possess the thing itself, and it hangs in the \nside of our chimney to this day”.  Then would the elder son be \nglad, and beg for a sight of it.  And sometimes it would be a piece \nof mirror, that showed the seeming of things; and then he would \nsay, “This can never be, for there should be more than seeming”.  \nAnd sometimes it would be a lump of coal, which showed nothing; and \nthen he would say, “This can never be, for at least there is the \nseeming”.  And sometimes it would be a touchstone indeed, beautiful \nin hue, adorned with polishing, the light inhabiting its sides; and \nwhen he found this, he would beg the thing, and the persons of that \nplace would give it him, for all men were very generous of that \ngift; so that at the last he had his wallet full of them, and they \nchinked together when he rode; and when he halted by the side of \nthe way he would take them out and try them, till his head turned \nlike the sails upon a windmill.",
        "“A murrain upon this business!” said the elder son, “for I perceive \nno end to it.  Here I have the red, and here the blue and the \ngreen; and to me they seem all excellent, and yet shame each other.  \nA murrain on the trade!  If it were not for the King that is a \npriest and whom I have called my father, and if it were not for the \nfair maid of the dun that makes my mouth to sing and my heart \nenlarge, I would even tumble them all into the salt sea, and go \nhome and be a King like other folk.”",
        "But he was like the hunter that has seen a stag upon a mountain, so \nthat the night may fall, and the fire be kindled, and the lights \nshine in his house; but desire of that stag is single in his bosom.",
        "Now after many years the elder son came upon the sides of the salt \nsea; and it was night, and a savage place, and the clamour of the \nsea was loud.  There he was aware of a house, and a man that sat \nthere by the light of a candle, for he had no fire.  Now the elder \nson came in to him, and the man gave him water to drink, for he had \nno bread; and wagged his head when he was spoken to, for he had no \nwords.",
        "“Have you the touchstone of truth?” asked the elder son and when \nthe man had wagged his head, “I might have known that,” cried the \nelder son.  “I have here a wallet full of them!”  And with that he \nlaughed, although his heart was weary.",
        "And with that the man laughed too, and with the fuff of his \nlaughter the candle went out.",
        "“Sleep,” said the man, “for now I think you have come far enough; \nand your quest is ended, and my candle is out.”",
        "Now when the morning came, the man gave him a clear pebble in his \nhand, and it had no beauty and no colour; and the elder son looked \nupon it scornfully and shook his head; and he went away, for it \nseemed a small affair to him.",
        "All that day he rode, and his mind was quiet, and the desire of the \nchase allayed.  “How if this poor pebble be the touchstone, after \nall?” said he: and he got down from his horse, and emptied forth \nhis wallet by the side of the way.  Now, in the light of each \nother, all the touchstones lost their hue and fire, and withered \nlike stars at morning; but in the light of the pebble, their beauty \nremained, only the pebble was the most bright.  And the elder son \nsmote upon his brow.  “How if this be the truth?” he cried, “that \nall are a little true?”  And he took the pebble, and turned its \nlight upon the heavens, and they deepened about him like the pit; \nand he turned it on the hills, and the hills were cold and rugged, \nbut life ran in their sides so that his own life bounded; and he \nturned it on the dust, and he beheld the dust with joy and terror; \nand he turned it on himself, and kneeled down and prayed.",
        "“Now, thanks be to God,” said the elder son, “I have found the \ntouchstone; and now I may turn my reins, and ride home to the King \nand to the maid of the dun that makes my mouth to sing and my heart \nenlarge.”",
        "Now when he came to the dun, he saw children playing by the gate \nwhere the King had met him in the old days; and this stayed his \npleasure, for he thought in his heart, “It is here my children \nshould be playing”.  And when he came into the hall, there was his \nbrother on the high seat and the maid beside him; and at that his \nanger rose, for he thought in his heart, “It is I that should be \nsitting there, and the maid beside me”.",
        "“Who are you?” said his brother.  “And what make you in the dun?”",
        "“I am your elder brother,” he replied.  “And I am come to marry the \nmaid, for I have brought the touchstone of truth.”",
        "Then the younger brother laughed aloud.  “Why,” said he, “I found \nthe touchstone years ago, and married the maid, and there are our \nchildren playing at the gate.”",
        "Now at this the elder brother grew as gray as the dawn.  “I pray \nyou have dealt justly,” said he, “for I perceive my life is lost.”",
        "“Justly?” quoth the younger brother.  “It becomes you ill, that are \na restless man and a runagate, to doubt my justice, or the King my \nfather’s, that are sedentary folk and known in the land.”",
        "“Nay,” said the elder brother, “you have all else, have patience \nalso; and suffer me to say the world is full of touchstones, and it \nappears not easily which is true.”",
        "“I have no shame of mine,” said the younger brother.  “There it is, \nand look in it.”",
        "So the elder brother looked in the mirror, and he was sore amazed; \nfor he was an old man, and his hair was white upon his head; and he \nsat down in the hall and wept aloud.",
        "“Now,” said the younger brother, “see what a fool’s part you have \nplayed, that ran over all the world to seek what was lying in our \nfather’s treasury, and came back an old carle for the dogs to bark \nat, and without chick or child.  And I that was dutiful and wise \nsit here crowned with virtues and pleasures, and happy in the light \nof my hearth.”",
        "“Methinks you have a cruel tongue,” said the elder brother; and he \npulled out the clear pebble and turned its light on his brother; \nand behold the man was lying, his soul was shrunk into the \nsmallness of a pea, and his heart was a bag of little fears like \nscorpions, and love was dead in his bosom.  And at that the elder \nbrother cried out aloud, and turned the light of the pebble on the \nmaid, and, lo! she was but a mask of a woman, and withinside’s she \nwas quite dead, and she smiled as a clock ticks, and knew not \nwherefore.",
        "“Oh, well,” said the elder brother, “I perceive there is both good \nand bad.  So fare ye all as well as ye may in the dun; but I will \ngo forth into the world with my pebble in my pocket.”",
        "THERE was a man in the islands who fished for his bare bellyful, \nand took his life in his hands to go forth upon the sea between \nfour planks.  But though he had much ado, he was merry of heart; \nand the gulls heard him laugh when the spray met him.  And though \nhe had little lore, he was sound of spirit; and when the fish came \nto his hook in the mid-waters, he blessed God without weighing.  He \nwas bitter poor in goods and bitter ugly of countenance, and he had \nno wife.",
        "It fell in the time of the fishing that the man awoke in his house \nabout the midst of the afternoon.  The fire burned in the midst, \nand the smoke went up and the sun came down by the chimney.  And \nthe man was aware of the likeness of one that warmed his hands at \nthe red peats.",
        "“I greet you,” said the man, “in the name of God.”",
        "“I greet you,” said he that warmed his hands, “but not in the name \nof God, for I am none of His; nor in the name of Hell, for I am not \nof Hell.  For I am but a bloodless thing, less than wind and \nlighter than a sound, and the wind goes through me like a net, and \nI am broken by a sound and shaken by the cold.”",
        "“Be plain with me,” said the man, “and tell me your name and of \nyour nature.”",
        "“My name,” quoth the other, “is not yet named, and my nature not \nyet sure.  For I am part of a man; and I was a part of your \nfathers, and went out to fish and fight with them in the ancient \ndays.  But now is my turn not yet come; and I wait until you have a \nwife, and then shall I be in your son, and a brave part of him, \nrejoicing manfully to launch the boat into the surf, skilful to \ndirect the helm, and a man of might where the ring closes and the \nblows are going.”",
        "“This is a marvellous thing to hear,” said the man; “and if you are \nindeed to be my son, I fear it will go ill with you; for I am \nbitter poor in goods and bitter ugly in face, and I shall never get \nme a wife if I live to the age of eagles.”",
        "“All this hate I come to remedy, my Father,” said the Poor Thing; \n\"for we must go this night to the little isle of sheep, where our \nfathers lie in the dead-cairn, and to-morrow to the Earl’s Hall, \nand there shall you find a wife by my providing.”",
        "So the man rose and put forth his boat at the time of the \nsunsetting; and the Poor Thing sat in the prow, and the spray blew \nthrough his bones like snow, and the wind whistled in his teeth, \nand the boat dipped not with the weight of him.",
        "“I am fearful to see you, my son,” said the man.  “ For methinks \nyou are no thing of God.”",
        "“It is only the wind that whistles in my teeth,” said the Poor \nThing, “and there is no life in me to keep it out.”",
        "So they came to the little isle of sheep, where the surf burst all \nabout it in the midst of the sea, and it was all green with \nbracken, and all wet with dew, and the moon enlightened it.  They \nran the boat into a cove, and set foot to land; and the man came \nheavily behind among the rocks in the deepness of the bracken, but \nthe Poor Thing went before him like a smoke in the light of the \nmoon.  So they came to the dead-cairn, and they laid their ears to \nthe stones; and the dead complained withinsides like a swarm of \nbees: “Time was that marrow was in our bones, and strength in our \nsinews; and the thoughts of our head were clothed upon with acts \nand the words of men.  But now are we broken in sunder, and the \nbonds of our bones are loosed, and our thoughts lie in the dust.”",
        "Then said the Poor Thing: “Charge them that they give you the \nvirtue they withheld”.",
        "And the man said: “Bones of my fathers, greeting! for I am sprung \nof your loins.  And now, behold, I break open the piled stones of \nyour cairn, and I let in the noon between your ribs.  Count it well \ndone, for it was to be; and give me what I come seeking in the name \nof blood and in the name of God.”",
        "And the spirits of the dead stirred in the cairn like ants; and \nthey spoke: “You have broken the roof of our cairn and let in the \nnoon between our ribs; and you have the strength of the still-\nliving.  But what virtue have we? what power? or what jewel here in \nthe dust with us, that any living man should covet or receive it? \nfor we are less than nothing.  But we tell you one thing, speaking \nwith many voices like bees, that the way is plain before all like \nthe grooves of launching: So forth into life and fear not, for so \ndid we all in the ancient ages.”  And their voices passed away like \nan eddy in a river.",
        "“Now,” said the Poor Thing, “they have told you a lesson, but make \nthem give you a gift.  Stoop your hand among the bones without \ndrawback, and you shall find their treasure.”",
        "So the man stooped his hand, and the dead laid hold upon it many \nand faint like ants; but he shook them off, and behold, what he \nbrought up in his hand was the shoe of a horse, and it was rusty.",
        "“It is a thing of no price,” quoth the man, “for it is rusty.”",
        "“We shall see that,” said the Poor Thing; “for in my thought it is \na good thing to do what our fathers did, and to keep what they kept \nwithout question.  And in my thought one thing is as good as \nanother in this world; and a shoe of a horse will do.”",
        "Now they got into their boat with the horseshoe, and when the dawn \nwas come they were aware of the smoke of the Earl’s town and the \nbells of the Kirk that beat.  So they set foot to shore; and the \nman went up to the market among the fishers over against the palace \nand the Kirk; and he was bitter poor and bitter ugly, and he had \nnever a fish to sell, but only a shoe of a horse in his creel, and \nit rusty.",
        "“Now,” said the Poor Thing, “do so and so, and you shall find a \nwife and I a mother.”",
        "It befell that the Earl’s daughter came forth to go into the Kirk \nupon her prayers; and when she saw the poor man stand in the market \nwith only the shoe of a horse, and it rusty, it came in her mind it \nshould be a thing of price.",
        "“What is that?” quoth she.",
        "“It is a shoe of a horse,” said the man.",
        "“And what is the use of it?” quoth the Earl’s daughter.",
        "“It is for no use,” said the man.",
        "“I may not believe that,” said she; “else why should you carry it?”",
        "“I do so,” said he, “because it was so my fathers did in the \nancient ages; and I have neither a better reason nor a worse.”",
        "Now the Earl’s daughter could not find it in her mind to believe \nhim.  “Come,” quoth she, “sell me this, for I am sure it is a thing \nof price.”",
        "“Nay,” said the man, “the thing is not for sale.”",
        "“What!” cried the Earl’s daughter.  “Then what make you here in the \ntown’s market, with the thing in your creel and nought beside?”",
        "“I sit here,” says the man, “to get me a wife.”",
        "“There is no sense in any of these answers,” thought the Earl’s \ndaughter; “and I could find it in my heart to weep.”",
        "By came the Earl upon that; and she called him and told him all.  \nAnd when he had heard, he was of his daughter’s mind that this \nshould be a thing of virtue; and charged the man to set a price \nupon the thing, or else be hanged upon the gallows; and that was \nnear at hand, so that the man could see it.",
        "“The way of life is straight like the grooves of launching,” quoth \nthe man.  “And if I am to be hanged let me be hanged.”",
        "“Why!” cried the Earl, “will you set your neck against a shoe of a \nhorse, and it rusty?”",
        "“In my thought,” said the man, “one thing is as good as another in \nthis world and a shoe of a horse will do.”",
        "“This can never be,” thought the Earl; and he stood and looked upon \nthe man, and bit his beard.",
        "And the man looked up at him and smiled.  “It was so my fathers did \nin the ancient ages,” quoth he to the Earl, “and I have neither a \nbetter reason nor a worse.”",
        "“There is no sense in any of this,” thought the Earl, “and I must \nbe growing old.”  So he had his daughter on one side, and says he: \n\"Many suitors have you denied, my child.  But here is a very \nstrange matter that a man should cling so to a shoe of a horse, and \nit rusty; and that he should offer it like a thing on sale, and yet \nnot sell it; and that he should sit there seeking a wife.  If I \ncome not to the bottom of this thing, I shall have no more pleasure \nin bread; and I can see no way, but either I should hang or you \nshould marry him.”",
        "“By my troth, but he is bitter ugly,” said the Earl’s daughter.  \n\"How if the gallows be so near at hand?”",
        "“It was not so,” said the Earl, “that my fathers did in the ancient \nages.  I am like the man, and can give you neither a better reason \nnor a worse.  But do you, prithee, speak with him again.”",
        "So the Earl’s daughter spoke to the man.  “If you were not so \nbitter ugly,” quoth she, “my father the Earl would have us marry.”",
        "“Bitter ugly am I,” said the man, “and you as fair as May.  Bitter \nugly I am, and what of that?  It was so my fathers - “",
        "“In the name of God,” said the Earl’s daughter, “let your fathers \nbe!”",
        "“If I had done that,” said the man, “you had never been chaffering \nwith me here in the market, nor your father the Earl watching with \nthe end of his eye.”",
        "“But come,” quoth the Earl’s daughter, “this is a very strange \nthing, that you would have me wed for a shoe of a horse, and it \nrusty.”",
        "“In my thought,” quoth the man, “one thing is as good - “",
        "“Oh, spare me that,” said the Earl’s daughter, “and tell me why I \nshould marry.”",
        "“Listen and look,” said the man.",
        "Now the wind blew through the Poor Thing like an infant crying, so \nthat her heart was melted; and her eyes were unsealed, and she was \naware of the thing as it were a babe unmothered, and she took it to \nher arms, and it melted in her arms like the air.",
        "“Come,” said the man, “behold a vision of our children, the busy \nhearth, and the white heads.  And let that suffice, for it is all \nGod offers.”",
        "“I have no delight in it,” said she; but with that she sighed.",
        "“The ways of life are straight like the grooves of launching,” said \nthe man; and he took her by the hand.",
        "“And what shall we do with the horseshoe?” quoth she.",
        "“I will give it to your father,” said the man; “and he can make a \nkirk and a mill of it for me.”",
        "It came to pass in time that the Poor Thing was born; but memory of \nthese matters slept within him, and he knew not that which he had \ndone.  But he was a part of the eldest son; rejoicing manfully to \nlaunch the boat into the surf, skilful to direct the helm, and a \nman of might where the ring closes and the blows are going.",
        "THE King of Duntrine had a daughter when he was old, and she was \nthe fairest King’s daughter between two seas; her hair was like \nspun gold, and her eyes like pools in a river; and the King gave \nher a castle upon the sea beach, with a terrace, and a court of the \nhewn stone, and four towers at the four corners.  Here she dwelt \nand grew up, and had no care for the morrow, and no power upon the \nhour, after the manner of simple men.",
        "It befell that she walked one day by the beach of the sea, when it \nwas autumn, and the wind blew from the place of rains; and upon the \none hand of her the sea beat, and upon the other the dead leaves \nran.  This was the loneliest beach between two seas, and strange \nthings had been done there in the ancient ages.  Now the King’s \ndaughter was aware of a crone that sat upon the beach.  The sea \nfoam ran to her feet, and the dead leaves swarmed about her back, \nand the rags blew about her face in the blowing of the wind.",
        "“Now,” said the King’s daughter, and she named a holy name, “this \nis the most unhappy old crone between two seas.”",
        "“Daughter of a King,” said the crone, “you dwell in a stone house, \nand your hair is like the gold: but what is your profit?  Life is \nnot long, nor lives strong; and you live after the way of simple \nmen, and have no thought for the morrow and no power upon the \nhour.”",
        "“Thought for the morrow, that I have,” said the King’s daughter; \n\"but power upon the hour, that have I not.”  And she mused with \nherself.",
        "Then the crone smote her lean hands one within the other, and \nlaughed like a sea-gull.  “Home!” cried she.  “O daughter of a \nKing, home to your stone house; for the longing is come upon you \nnow, nor can you live any more after the manner of simple men.  \nHome, and toil and suffer, till the gift come that will make you \nbare, and till the man come that will bring you care.”",
        "The King’s daughter made no more ado, but she turned about and went \nhome to her house in silence.  And when she was come into her \nchamber she called for her nurse.",
        "“Nurse,” said the King’s daughter, “thought is come upon me for the \nmorrow, so that I can live no more after the manner of simple men.  \nTell me what I must do that I may have power upon the hour.”",
        "Then the nurse moaned like a snow wind.  “Alas!” said she, “that \nthis thing should be; but the thought is gone into your marrow, nor \nis there any cure against the thought.  Be it so, then, even as you \nwill; though power is less than weakness, power shall you have; and \nthough the thought is colder than winter, yet shall you think it to \nan end.”",
        "So the King’s daughter sat in her vaulted chamber in the masoned \nhouse, and she thought upon the thought.  Nine years she sat; and \nthe sea beat upon the terrace, and the gulls cried about the \nturrets, and wind crooned in the chimneys of the house.  Nine years \nshe came not abroad, nor tasted the clean air, neither saw God’s \nsky.  Nine years she sat and looked neither to the right nor to the \nleft, nor heard speech of any one, but thought upon the thought of \nthe morrow.  And her nurse fed her in silence, and she took of the \nfood with her left hand, and ate it without grace.",
        "Now when the nine years were out, it fell dusk in the autumn, and \nthere came a sound in the wind like a sound of piping.  At that the \nnurse lifted up her finger in the vaulted house.",
        "“I hear a sound in the wind,” said she, “that is like the sound of \npiping.”",
        "“It is but a little sound,” said the King’s daughter, “but yet is \nit sound enough for me.”",
        "So they went down in the dusk to the doors of the house, and along \nthe beach of the sea.  And the waves beat upon the one hand, and \nupon the other the dead leaves ran; and the clouds raced in the \nsky, and the gulls flew widdershins.  And when they came to that \npart of the beach where strange things had been done in the ancient \nages, lo, there was the crone, and she was dancing widdershins.",
        "“What makes you dance widdershins, old crone?” said the King’s \ndaughter; “here upon the bleak beach, between the waves and the \ndead leaves?”",
        "“I hear a sound in the wind that is like a sound of piping,” quoth \nshe.  “And it is for that that I dance widdershins.  For the gift \ncomes that will make you bare, and the man comes that must bring \nyou care.  But for me the morrow is come that I have thought upon, \nand the hour of my power.”",
        "“How comes it, crone,” said the King’s daughter, “that you waver \nlike a rag, and pale like a dead leaf before my eyes?”",
        "“Because the morrow has come that I have thought upon, and the hour \nof my power,” said the crone; and she fell on the beach, and, lo! \nshe was but stalks of the sea tangle, and dust of the sea sand, and \nthe sand lice hopped upon the place of her.",
        "“This is the strangest thing that befell between two seas,” said \nthe King’s daughter of Duntrine.",
        "But the nurse broke out and moaned like an autumn gale.  “I am \nweary of the wind,” quoth she; and she bewailed her day.",
        "The King’s daughter was aware of a man upon the beach; he went \nhooded so that none might perceive his face, and a pipe was \nunderneath his arm.  The sound of his pipe was like singing wasps, \nand like the wind that sings in windlestraw; and it took hold upon \nmen’s ears like the crying of gulls.",
        "“Are you the comer?” quoth the King’s daughter of Duntrine.",
        "“I am the corner,” said he, “and these are the pipes that a man may \nhear, and I have power upon the hour, and this is the song of the \nmorrow.”  And he piped the song of the morrow, and it was as long \nas years; and the nurse wept out aloud at the hearing of it.",
        "“This is true,” said the King’s daughter, “that you pipe the song \nof the morrow; but that ye have power upon the hour, how may I know \nthat?  Show me a marvel here upon the beach, between the waves and \nthe dead leaves.”",
        "And the man said, “Upon whom?”",
        "“Here is my nurse,” quoth the King’s daughter.  “She is weary of \nthe wind.  Show me a good marvel upon her.”",
        "And, lo! the nurse fell upon the beach as it were two handfuls of \ndead leaves, and the wind whirled them widdershins, and the sand \nlice hopped between.",
        "“It is true,” said the King’s daughter of Duntrine, “you are the \ncomer, and you have power upon the hour.  Come with me to my stone \nhouse.”",
        "So they went by the sea margin, and the man piped the song of the \nmorrow, and the leaves followed behind them as they went.",
        "Then they sat down together; and the sea beat on the terrace, and \nthe gulls cried about the towers, and the wind crooned in the \nchimneys of the house.  Nine years they sat, and every year when it \nfell autumn, the man said, “This is the hour, and I have power in \nit\"; and the daughter of the King said, “Nay, but pipe me the song \nof the morrow”.
