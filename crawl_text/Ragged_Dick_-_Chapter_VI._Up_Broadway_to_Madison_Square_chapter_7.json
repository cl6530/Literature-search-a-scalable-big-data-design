        "As the boys pursued their way up Broadway, Dick pointed out the\nprominent hotels and places of amusement. Frank was particularly\nstruck with the imposing fronts of the St. Nicholas and Metropolitan\nHotels, the former of white marble, the latter of a subdued brown\nhue, but not less elegant in its internal appointments. He was not\nsurprised to be informed that each of these splendid structures cost\nwith the furnishing not far from a million dollars.",
        "At Eighth Street Dick turned to the right, and pointed out the\nClinton Hall Building now occupied by the Mercantile Library,\ncomprising at that time over fifty thousand volumes.*",
        "* Now not far from one hundred thousand.",
        "A little farther on they came to a large building standing by itself\njust at the opening of Third and Fourth Avenues, and with one side\non each.",
        "“What is that building?” asked Frank.",
        "“That’s the Cooper Institute,” said Dick; “built by Mr. Cooper,\na particular friend of mine. Me and Peter Cooper used to go to\nschool together.”",
        "“What is there inside?” asked Frank.",
        "“There’s a hall for public meetin’s and lectures in the basement,\nand a readin’ room and a picture gallery up above,” said Dick.",
        "Directly opposite Cooper Institute, Frank saw a very large building\nof brick, covering about an acre of ground.",
        "“Is that a hotel?” he asked.",
        "“No,” said Dick; “that’s the Bible House. It’s the place where they\nmake Bibles. I was in there once,–saw a big pile of ’em.”",
        "“Did you ever read the Bible?” asked Frank, who had some idea of the\nneglected state of Dick’s education.",
        "“No,” said Dick; “I’ve heard it’s a good book, but I never read one.\nI aint much on readin’. It makes my head ache.”",
        "“I suppose you can’t read very fast.”",
        "“I can read the little words pretty well, but the big ones is what\nstick me.”",
        "“If I lived in the city, you might come every evening to me, and I\nwould teach you.”",
        "“Would you take so much trouble about me?” asked Dick, earnestly.",
        "“Certainly; I should like to see you getting on. There isn’t much\nchance of that if you don’t know how to read and write.”",
        "“You’re a good feller,” said Dick, gratefully. “I wish you did live\nin New York. I’d like to know somethin’. Whereabouts do you live?”",
        "“About fifty miles off, in a town on the left bank of the Hudson.\nI wish you’d come up and see me sometime. I would like to have you\ncome and stop two or three days.”",
        "“Honor bright?”",
        "“I don’t understand.”",
        "“Do you mean it?” asked Dick, incredulously.",
        "“Of course I do. Why shouldn’t I?”",
        "“What would your folks say if they knowed you asked a boot-black to\nvisit you?”",
        "“You are none the worse for being a boot-black, Dick.”",
        "“I aint used to genteel society,” said Dick. “I shouldn’t know how\nto behave.”",
        "“Then I could show you. You won’t be a boot-black all your life, you\nknow.”",
        "“No,” said Dick; “I’m goin’ to knock off when I get to be ninety.”",
        "“Before that, I hope,” said Frank, smiling.",
        "“I really wish I could get somethin’ else to do,” said Dick,\nsoberly. “I’d like to be a office boy, and learn business, and grow\nup ’spectable.”",
        "“Why don’t you try, and see if you can’t get a place, Dick?”",
        "“Who’d take Ragged Dick?”",
        "“But you aint ragged now, Dick.”",
        "“No,” said Dick; “I look a little better than I did in my Washington\ncoat and Louis Napoleon pants. But if I got in a office, they\nwouldn’t give me more’n three dollars a week, and I couldn’t live\n’spectable on that.”",
        "“No, I suppose not,” said Frank, thoughtfully. “But you would get\nmore at the end of the first year.”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick; “but by that time I’d be nothin’ but skin and\nbones.”",
        "Frank laughed. “That reminds me,” he said, “of the story of an\nIrishman, who, out of economy, thought he would teach his horse to\nfeed on shavings. So he provided the horse with a pair of green\nspectacles which made the shavings look eatable. But unfortunately,\njust as the horse got learned, he up and died.”",
        "“The hoss must have been a fine specimen of architectur’ by the time\nhe got through,” remarked Dick.",
        "“Whereabouts are we now?” asked Frank, as they emerged from Fourth\nAvenue into Union Square.",
        "“That is Union Park,” said Dick, pointing to a beautiful enclosure,\nin the centre of which was a pond, with a fountain playing.",
        "“Is that the statue of General Washington?” asked Frank, pointing to\na bronze equestrian statue, on a granite pedestal.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick; “he’s growed some since he was President. If\nhe’d been as tall as that when he fit in the Revolution, he’d have\nwalloped the Britishers some, I reckon.”",
        "Frank looked up at the statue, which is fourteen and a half feet\nhigh, and acknowledged the justice of Dick’s remark.",
        "“How about the coat, Dick?” he asked. “Would it fit you?”",
        "“Well, it might be rather loose,” said Dick, “I aint much more’n\nten feet high with my boots off.”",
        "“No, I should think not,” said Frank, smiling. “You’re a queer boy,\nDick.”",
        "“Well, I’ve been brought up queer. Some boys is born with a silver\nspoon in their mouth. Victoria’s boys is born with a gold spoon, set\nwith di’monds; but gold and silver was scarce when I was born, and\nmine was pewter.”",
        "“Perhaps the gold and silver will come by and by, Dick. Did you ever\nhear of Dick Whittington?”",
        "“Never did. Was he a Ragged Dick?”",
        "“I shouldn’t wonder if he was. At any rate he was very poor when he\nwas a boy, but he didn’t stay so. Before he died, he became Lord\nMayor of London.”",
        "“Did he?” asked Dick, looking interested. “How did he do it?”",
        "“Why, you see, a rich merchant took pity on him, and gave him a\nhome in his own house, where he used to stay with the servants,\nbeing employed in little errands. One day the merchant noticed Dick\npicking up pins and needles that had been dropped, and asked him\nwhy he did it. Dick told him he was going to sell them when he got\nenough. The merchant was pleased with his saving disposition, and\nwhen soon after, he was going to send a vessel to foreign parts, he\ntold Dick he might send anything he pleased in it, and it should\nbe sold to his advantage. Now Dick had nothing in the world but a\nkitten which had been given him a short time before.”",
        "“How much taxes did he have to pay on it?” asked Dick.",
        "“Not very high, probably. But having only the kitten, he concluded\nto send it along. After sailing a good many months, during which the\nkitten grew up to be a strong cat, the ship touched at an island\nnever before known, which happened to be infested with rats and\nmice to such an extent that they worried everybody’s life out, and\neven ransacked the king’s palace. To make a long story short, the\ncaptain, seeing how matters stood, brought Dick’s cat ashore,\nand she soon made the rats and mice scatter. The king was highly\ndelighted when he saw what havoc she made among the rats and mice,\nand resolved to have her at any price. So he offered a great\nquantity of gold for her, which, of course, the captain was glad\nto accept. It was faithfully carried back to Dick, and laid the\nfoundation of his fortune. He prospered as he grew up, and in time\nbecame a very rich merchant, respected by all, and before he died\nwas elected Lord Mayor of London.”",
        "“That’s a pretty good story” said Dick; “but I don’t believe all the\ncats in New York will ever make me mayor.”",
        "“No, probably not, but you may rise in some other way. A good many\ndistinguished men have once been poor boys. There’s hope for you,\nDick, if you’ll try.”",
        "“Nobody ever talked to me so before,” said Dick. “They just called\nme Ragged Dick, and told me I’d grow up to be a vagabone (boys who\nare better educated need not be surprised at Dick’s blunders) and\ncome to the gallows.”",
        "“Telling you so won’t make it turn out so, Dick. If you’ll try to\nbe somebody, and grow up into a respectable member of society, you\nwill. You may not become rich,–it isn’t everybody that becomes\nrich, you know–but you can obtain a good position, and be\nrespected.”",
        "“I’ll try,” said Dick, earnestly. “I needn’t have been Ragged Dick\nso long if I hadn’t spent my money in goin’ to the theatre, and\ntreatin’ boys to oyster-stews, and bettin’ money on cards, and\nsuch like.”",
        "“Have you lost money that way?”",
        "“Lots of it. One time I saved up five dollars to buy me a new\nrig-out, cos my best suit was all in rags, when Limpy Jim wanted\nme to play a game with him.”",
        "“Limpy Jim?” said Frank, interrogatively.",
        "“Yes, he’s lame; that’s what makes us call him Limpy Jim.”",
        "“I suppose you lost?”",
        "“Yes, I lost every penny, and had to sleep out, cos I hadn’t a cent\nto pay for lodgin’. ’Twas a awful cold night, and I got most froze.”",
        "“Wouldn’t Jim let you have any of the money he had won to pay for a\nlodging?”",
        "“No; I axed him for five cents, but he wouldn’t let me have it.”",
        "“Can you get lodging for five cents?” asked Frank, in surprise.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, “but not at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. That’s it\nright out there.”",
