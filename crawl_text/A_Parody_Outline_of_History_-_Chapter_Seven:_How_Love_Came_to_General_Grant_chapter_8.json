        "On a brisk winter evening in the winter of 1864 the palatial\nFifth Avenue “palace” of Cornelius van der Griff was brilliantly\nlighted with many brilliant lights.  Outside the imposing front\nentrance a small group of pedestrians had gathered to gape\nenviously at the invited guests of the “four hundred” who were\nbeginning to arrive in elegant equipages, expensive ball-dresses\nand fashionable “swallowtails”.",
        "“Hully gee!” exclaimed little Frank, a crippled newsboy who was\nthe only support of an aged mother, as a particularly sumptuous\ncarriage drove up and a stylishly dressed lady of fifty-five or\nsixty stepped out accompanied by a haughty society girl and an\nelderly gentleman in clerical dress. It was Mrs. Rhinelander, a\nsocial leader, and her daughter Geraldine, together with the Rev.\nDr. Gedney, pastor of an exclusive Fifth Avenue church.",
        "“What common looking people,” said Mrs. Rhinelander, surveying\nthe crowd aristocratically with her lorgnette.",
        "“Yes, aren’t they?” replied the clergyman with a condescending\nglance which ill befit his clerical garb.",
        "“I’m glad you don’t have people like that dans votre eglise, Dr.\nGedney,” said young Geraldine, who thought it was “smart” to\ndisplay her proficiency in the stylish French tongue. At this\nmoment the door of the van der Griff residence was opened for\nthem by an imposing footman in scarlet livery and they passed\ninto the abode of the “elect”.",
        "“Hully gee!” repeated little Frank.",
        "“What’s going on to-night?” asked a newcomer.",
        "“Gee—don’t youse know?” answered the newsboy.  “Dis is de van\nder Griffs’ and tonight dey are giving a swell dinner for General\nGrant.  Dat lady wot just went in was old Mrs. Rhinelander.  I\nseen her pitcher in de last Harper’s Weekly and dere was a story\nin de paper dis morning dat her daughter Geraldine was going to\nmarry de General.”",
        "“That isn’t so,” broke in another.  “It was just a rumor.”",
        "“Well, anyway,” said Frank, “I wisht de General would hurry up\nand come— it’s getting cold enough to freeze the tail off a\nbrass monkey.” The onlookers laughed merrily at his humorous\nreference to the frigid temperature, although many cast\nsympathetic looks at his thin threadbare garments and registered\na kindly thought for this brave boy who so philosophically\naccepted the buffets of fate.",
        "“I bet this is him now,” cried Frank, and all waited expectantly\nas a vehicle drove up.  The cabman jumped off his box and held\nthe carriage door open.",
        "“Here you are, Miss Flowers,” he said, touching his hat\nrespectfully.",
        "A silver peal of rippling laughter sounded from the interior of\nthe carriage.",
        "“Why Jerry,” came in velvet tones addressed to the coachman, “You\nmustn’t be so formal just because I have come to New York to\nlive. Call me ’Miss Ella,’ of course, just like you did when we\nlived out in Kansas,” and with these words Miss Ella Flowers, for\nit was she, stepped out of the carriage.",
        "A hush fell on the crowd as they caught sight of her face—a hush\nof silent tribute to the clear sweet womanhood of that pure\ncountenance. A young man on the edge of the crowd who was on the\nverge of becoming a drunkard burst into tears and walked rapidly\naway to join the nearest church. A pr-st---te who had been plying\nher nefarious trade on the avenue, sank to her knees to pray for\nstrength to go back to her aged parents on the farm. Another\nyoung man, catching sight of Ella’s pure face, vowed to write\nhome to his old mother and send her the money he had been\nexpending in the city on drinks and dissipation.",
        "And well might these city people be affected by the glimpse of\nthe sweet noble virtue which shone forth so radiantly in this\nKansas girl’s countenance. Although born in Jersey City, Ella had\nmoved with her parents to the west at an early age and she had\ngrown up in the open country where a man’s a man and women lead\nclean sweet womanly lives.  Out in the pure air of God’s green\nplaces and amid kindly, simple, big hearted folks, little Ella\nhad blossomed and thrived, the pride of the whole country, and as\nshe had grown to womanhood there was many a masculine heart beat\na little faster for her presence and many a manly blush of\nadmiration came into the features of her admirers as she whirled\ngracefully with them in the innocent pleasure of a simple country\ndance. But on her eighteenth birthday, her parents had passed on\nto the Great Beyond and the heartbroken Ella had come East to\nlive with Mrs. Montgomery, her aunt in Jersey City.  This lady,\nbeing socially prominent in New York’s “four hundred”, was of\ncourse quite ambitious that her pretty little niece from the West\nshould also enter society. For the last three months, therefore,\nElla had been feted at all the better class homes in New York and\nJersey City, and as Mrs. van der Griff, the Fifth Avenue social\nleader, was in the same set as Ella’s aunt, it was only natural\nthat when making out her list of guests for the dinner in honor\nof General Grant she should include the beautiful niece of her\nfriend.",
        "As Ella stepped from the carriage, her gaze fell upon little\nFrank, the crippled newsboy, and her eyes quickly filled with\ntears, for social success had not yet caused her to forget that\n“blessed are the weak”. Taking out her purse, she gave Frank a\nsilver dollar and a warm look of sympathy as she passed into the\nhouse.",
        "“Gee, there went an angel,” whispered the little cripple, and\nmany who heard him silently echoed that thought in their hearts.\nNor were they far from wrong.",
        "But even an angel is not free from temptation, and by letting\nElla go into society her aunt was exposing the girl to the\nwhisperings of Satan— whisperings of things material rather than\nthings spiritual. Many a girl just as pure as Ella has found her\nstandards gradually lowered and her moral character slowly\nweakened by the contact with the so-called “refined” and\n“cultured” infidels one meets in fashionable society. Many a\nfather and mother whose ambition has caused them to have their\ndaughter go out in society have bitterly repented of that step as\nthey watched the poor girl gradually succumbing to the temptation\nof the world. Let her who thinks it is “smart” to be in society\nconsider that our brothels with their red plush curtains, their\nhardwood floors and their luxurious appointments, are filled\nlargely with the worn out belles and debutantes of fashionable\nsociety.",
        "The next minute a bugle call sounded down the street and up drove\na team of prancing grays.  Two soldiers sprang down from the\ncoachman’s box and stood at rigid attention while the door of the\ncarriage opened and out stepped General Ulysses S. Grant.",
        "A murmur of admiration swept over the crowd at the sight of his\nmanly inspiring features, in which the clean cut virility of a\nlife free from dissipation was accentuated by the neatly trimmed\nblack beard. His erect military bearing—his neat, well fitting\nuniform—but above all his frank open face proclaimed him a man’s\nman—a man among men. A cheer burst from the lips of the\nonlookers and the brave but modest general lowered his eyes and\nblushed as he acknowledged their greeting.",
        "“Men and women,” he said, in a voice which although low, one\ncould see was accustomed to being obeyed, “I thank you for your\ncheers. It makes my heart rejoice to hear them, for I know you\nare not cheering me personally but only as one of the many men\nwho are fighting for the cause of liberty and freedom, and\nfor----” the general’s voice broke a little, but he mastered his\nemotion and went on—\"for the flag we all love.”",
        "At this he pulled from his pocket an American flag and held it up\nso that all could see.  Cheer after cheer rent the air, and tears\ncame to the general’s eyes at this mark of devotion to the common\ncause.",
        "“Wipe the d—d rebels off the face of the earth, G-d d—’em,\"\nshouted a too enthusiastic member of the crowd who, I fear, was a\nlittle the worse for drink.  In an instant General Grant had\nstepped up to him and fixed upon him those fearless blue eyes.",
        "“My man,” said the general, “It hurts me to hear you give vent to\nthose oaths, especially in the presence of ladies. Soldiers do\nnot curse, and I think you would do well to follow their\nexample.”",
        "The other lowered his head shamefacedly.  “General,” he said,\n“You’re right and I apologize.”",
        "A smile lit up the general’s handsome features and he extended\nhis hand to the other.",
        "“Shake on it,” he said simply, and as the crowd roared its\napproval of this speech the two men “shook”.",
        "Meanwhile within the van der Griff house all were agog with\nexcitement in expectation of the arrival of the distinguished\nguest. Expensively dressed ladies fluttered here and there amid\nthe elegant appointments; servants in stylish livery passed to\nand fro with trays of wine and other spirituous liquors.",
        "At the sound of the cheering outside, the haughty Mrs.\nRhinelander patted her daughter Geraldine nervously, and between\nmother and daughter passed a glance of understanding, for both\nfelt that to-night, if ever, was Geraldine’s opportunity to win\nthe handsome and popular general.",
        "The doorbell rang, and a hush fell over the chattering\nassemblage; then came the proud announcement from the\ndoorman—\"General Ulysses S. Grant\"—and all the society belles\ncrowded forward around the guest of honor.",
        "It had been rumored that the general, being a soldier, was\nignorant of social etiquette, but such proved to be far from the\ncase. Indeed, he handled himself with such ease of manner that he\ncaptivated all, and for each and every young miss he had an apt\nphrase or a pretty compliment, greatly to their\ndelight.",
        "“Pleased to know you\"—\"Glad to shake the hand of such a pretty\ngirl\"—\"What a nice little hand—I wish I might hold it all\nevening\"— with these and kindred pleasantries the general won\nthe way into the graces of Mrs. van der Griff’s fair guests, and\nmany a female heart fluttered in her bosom as she gazed into the\nclear blue eyes of the soldier, and listened to his well chosen\ntactful words.",
        "“And how is the dear General this evening?\"—this in the affected\ntone of old Mrs. Rhinelander, as she forced her way through the\ncrowd.",
        "“Finer than silk,” replied he, and he added, solicitously, “I\nhope you have recovered from your lumbago, Mrs. Rhinelander.”",
        "“Oh quite,” answered she, “and here is Geraldine, General,” and\nthe ambitious mother pushed her daughter forward.",
        "“Comment vous portez vous, mon General,” said Geraldine in\nFrench, “I hope we can have a nice tete-a-tete to-night,” and she\nfawned upon her prey in a manner that would have sickened a less\nartificial gathering.",
        "Were there not some amid all that fashionable throng in whom\nideals of purity and true womanhood lived—some who cared enough\nfor the sacredness of real love to cry upon this hollow mockery\nthat was being used to ensnare the simple, honest soldier? There\nwas only one, and she was at that moment entering the drawing\nroom for the purpose of being presented to the general. Need I\nname her?",
        "Ella, for it was she, had been upstairs busying herself with her\ntoilet when General Grant had arrived and she now hurried forward\nto pay her homage to the great soldier. And then, as she caught\nsight of his face, she stopped suddenly and a deep crimson blush\nspread over her features. She looked again, and then drew back\nbehind a nearby portiere, her heart beating wildly.",
        "Well did Ella remember where she had seen that countenance\nbefore, and as she stood there trembling the whole scene of her\nfolly came back to her.  It had happened in Kansas, just before\nher parents died, on one sunny May morning. She had gone for a\nwalk; her footsteps had led her to the banks of a secluded lake\nwhere she often went when she wished to be alone.  Many an\nafternoon had Ella dreamed idly away on this shore, but that day,\nfor some reason, she had felt unusually full of life and not at\nall like dreaming. Obeying a thoughtless but innocent impulse,\nwith no intention of evil, she had taken off her clothes and\nplunged thus n-k-d into the cool waters of the lake.  After she\nhad swum around a little she began to realize the extent of her\nfolly and was hurriedly swimming towards the shore when a\nterrific cramp had seized her lower limbs, rendering them\npowerless. Her first impulse, to scream for help, was quickly\nchecked with a deep blush, as she realized the consequences if a\nman should hear her call, for nearby was an encampment of Union\nsoldiers, none of whom she knew. The perplexed and helpless girl\nwas in sore straits and was slowly sinking for the third time,\nwhen a bearded stranger in soldier’s uniform appeared on the bank\nand dove into the water.  To her horror he swam rapidly towards\nher—but her shame was soon changed to joy when she realized that\nhe was purposely keeping his eyes tight shut.  With a few swift\npowerful strokes he reached her side, and, blushing deeply, took\noff his blue coat, fastened it around her, opened his eyes, and\nswam with her to the shore. Carrying her to where she had left\nher clothes he stayed only long enough to assure himself that she\nhad completely recovered the use of her limbs, and evidently to\nspare her further embarrassment, had vanished as quickly and as\nmysteriously as he had appeared.",
        "Many a night after that had Ella lain awake thinking of the\nsplendid features and, the even more splendid conduct of this\nunknown knight who wore the uniform of the Union army.  “How I\nlove him,” she would whisper to herself; “but how he must despise\nme!” she would cry, and her pillow was often wet with tears of\nshame and mortification at her folly.",
        "It was shortly after this episode that her parents had taken sick\nand passed away.  Ella had come East and had given up hope of\never seeing her rescuer again. You may imagine her feelings then\nwhen, on entering the drawing room at the van der Griffs’, she\ndiscovered that the stranger who had so gallantly and tactfully\nrescued her from a watery grave was none other than General\nUlysses S. Grant.",
        "The poor girl was torn by a tumult of contrary emotions. Suppose\nhe should remember her face.  She blushed at the thought. And\nbesides what chance had she to win such a great man’s heart in\ncompetition with these society girls like Geraldine Rhinelander\nwho had been “abroad” and spoke French.",
        "At that moment one of the liveried servants approached the\ngeneral with a trayful of filled wine glasses.  So engrossed was\nthe soldier hero in talking to Geraldine—or, rather, in\nlistening to her alluring chatter— that he did not at first\nnotice what was being offered him.",
        "“Will you have a drink of champagne wine, General?” said Mrs. van\nder Griff who stood near.",
        "The general raised his head and frowned as if he did not\nunderstand.",
        "“Come, mon General,” cried Geraldine gayly, “We shall drink a\nvotre succes dans la guerre,” and the flighty girl raised a glass\nof wine on high. Several of the guests crowded around and all\nwere about to drink to the general’s health.",
        "“Stop,” cried General Grant suddenly realizing what was being\ndone, and something in the tone of his voice made everyone\npause.",
        "“Madam,” said he, turning to Mrs. van der Griff, “Am I to\nunderstand that there is liquor in those glasses?”",
        "“Why yes, General,” said the hostess smiling uneasily. “It is\njust a little champagne wine.”",
        "“Madam,” said the general, “It may be ’just champagne wine’ to\nyou, but ’just champagne wine’ has ruined many a poor fellow and\nto me all alcoholic beverages are an abomination. I cannot\nconsent, madam, to remain under your roof if they are to be\nserved.  I have never taken a drop—I have tried to  stamp it out\nof the army, and I owe it to my soldiers to decline to be a guest\nat a house where wine and liquor are served.”",
        "An excited buzz of comment arose as the general delivered this\nultimatum. A few there were who secretly approved his sentiments,\nbut they were far too few in numbers and constant indulgence in\nalcohol had weakened their wills so that they dared not stand\nforth. An angry flush appeared on the face of the hostess, for in\nsociety, “good form” is more important than courage and ideals,\nand by his frank statement General Grant had violently violated\nthe canons of correct social etiquette.",
        "“Very well, Mr. Grant,” she said, stressing the “Mr.\"—\"if that’s\nthe way you feel about it----”",
        "“Stop,” cried an unexpected voice, and to the amazement of all\nElla Flowers stepped forward, her teeth clenched, her eyes\nblazing.",
        "“Stop,” she repeated, “He is right—the liquor evil is one of the\nworst curses of modern civilization, and if General Grant leaves,\nso do I.”",
        "Mrs. van der Griff hesitated for an instant, and then suddenly\nforced a smile.",
        "“Why Ella dear, of course General Grant is right,” said she, for\nit was well known in financial circles that her husband, Mr. van\nder Griff, had recently borrowed heavily from Ella’s uncle.\n“There will not be a drop of wine served to-night, and now\nGeneral, shall we go in to dinner?  Will you be so kind as to\nlead the way with Miss Rhinelander?”  The hostess had recovered\nher composure, and smiling sweetly at the guest of honor, gave\norders to the servants to remove the wine glasses.",
        "But General Grant did not hear her; he was looking at Ella\nFlowers. And as he gazed at the sweet beauty of her countenance\nhe seemed to feel rising within him something which he had never\nfelt before— something which made everything else seem petty and\ntrivial. And as he looked into her eyes and she looked into his,\nhe read her answer— the only answer true womanhood can make to\nclean, worthy manhood.",
        "“Shall we go a la salle-a-manger?” sounded a voice in his ears,\nand Geraldine’s sinuous arm was thrust through his.",
        "General Grant took the proffered talon and gently removed it from\nhim.",
        "“Miss Rhinelander,” he said firmly, “I am taking this young lady\nas my partner,” and suiting the action to the word, he graciously\nextended his arm to Ella who took it with a pretty blush.",
        "It was General Grant’s turn to blush when the other guests, with\na few exceptions, applauded his choice loudly, and made way\nenthusiastically as the handsome couple advanced to the\nbrilliantly lighted dining room.",
        "But although the hostess had provided the most costly of viands,\nI am afraid that the brave general did not fully appreciate them,\nfor in his soul was the joy of a strong man who has found his\nmate and in his heart was the singing of the eternal song, “I\nlove her— I love her—I love her!”",
        "It was only too apparent to the other guests what had happened\nand to their credit be it said that they heartily approved his\nchoice, for Mrs. Rhinelander and her scheming daughter Geraldine\nhad made countless enemies with their haughty manners, whereas\nthe sweet simplicity of Ella Flowers had won her numerous\nfriends. And all laughed merrily when General Grant, in his after\ndinner speech, said “flowers” instead of “flour” when speaking of\nprovisioning the army—a slip which caused both the general and\nMiss Flowers to blush furiously, greatly to the delight of the\ngood-natured guests. “All the world loves a lover\"—truer words\nwere never penned.",
        "After dinner, while the other men, according to the usages of\nbest society, were filling the air of the dining room with the\nfumes of nicotine, the general, who did not use tobacco, excused\nhimself—amid many sly winks from the other men— and wandered\nout into the conservatory.",
        "There he found Ella.",
        "“General,” she began.",
        "“Miss Flowers,” said the strong man simply, “Call me Ulysses.”",
        "And there let us leave them.",
