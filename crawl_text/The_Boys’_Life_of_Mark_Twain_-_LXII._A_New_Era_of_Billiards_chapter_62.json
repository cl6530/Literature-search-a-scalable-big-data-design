        "With the return to New York I began a period of closer association with\nMark Twain.  Up to that time our relations had been chiefly of a literary\nnature.  They now became personal as well.",
        "It happened in this way: Mark Twain had never outgrown his love for the\ngame of billiards, though he had not owned a table since the closing of\nthe Hartford house, fifteen years before.  Mrs. Henry Rogers had proposed\nto present him with a table for Christmas, but when he heard of the plan,\nboylike, he could not wait, and hinted that if he had the table “right\nnow” he could begin to use it sooner.  So the table came–a handsome\ncombination affair, suitable to all games–and was set in place.  That\nmorning when the dictation ended he said:",
        "“Have you any special place to lunch, to-day?”",
        "I replied that I had not.",
        "“Lunch here,” he said, “and we’ll try the new billiard-table.”",
        "I acknowledged that I had never played more than a few games of pool, and\nthose very long ago.",
        "“No matter,” he said “the poorer you play the better I shall like it.”",
        "So I remained for luncheon, and when it was over we began the first game\never played on the “Christmas” table.  He taught me a game in which\ncaroms and pockets both counted, and he gave me heavy odds.  He beat me,\nbut it was a riotous, rollicking game, the beginning of a closer relation\nbetween us.  We played most of the afternoon, and he suggested that I\n“come back in the evening and play some more.”  I did so, and the game\nlasted till after midnight.  I had beginner’s luck–\"nigger luck,” as he\ncalled it–and it kept him working feverishly to win.  Once when I had\nmade a great fluke–a carom followed by most of the balls falling into\nthe pockets, he said:",
        "“When you pick up that cue this table drips at every pore.”",
        "The morning dictations became a secondary interest.  Like a boy, he was\nlooking forward to the afternoon of play, and it seemed never to come\nquickly enough to suit him.  I remained regularly for luncheon, and he\nwas inclined to cut the courses short that we might the sooner get up-\nstairs for billiards.  He did not eat the midday meal himself, but he\nwould come down and walk about the dining-room, talking steadily that\nmarvelous, marvelous talk which little by little I trained myself to\nremember, though never with complete success.  He was only killing time,\nand I remember once, when he had been earnestly discussing some deep\nquestion, he suddenly noticed that the luncheon was ending.",
        "“Now,” he said, “we will proceed to more serious matters–it’s your–\nshot.”",
        "My game improved with practice, and he reduced my odds.  He was willing\nto be beaten, but not too often.  We kept a record of the games, and he\nwent to bed happier if the tally-sheet showed a balance in his favor.",
        "He was not an even-tempered player.  When the game went steadily against\nhim he was likely to become critical, even fault-finding, in his remarks.\nThen presently he would be seized with remorse and become over-gentle and\nattentive, placing the balls as I knocked them into the pockets, hurrying\nto render this service.  I wished he would not do it.  It distressed me\nthat he should humble himself.  I was willing that he should lose his\ntemper, that he should be even harsh if he felt so inclined–his age, his\nposition, his genius gave him special privileges.  Yet I am glad, as I\nremember it now, that the other side revealed itself, for it completes\nthe sum of his humanity.  Once in a burst of exasperation he made such an\nonslaught on the balls that he landed a couple of them on the floor.  I\ngathered them up and we went on playing as if nothing had happened, only\nhe was very gentle and sweet, like a summer meadow when the storm has\npassed by.  Presently he said:",
        "“This is a most amusing game.  When you play badly it amuses me, and\n     when I play badly and lose my temper it certainly must amuse you.”",
        "It was but natural that friendship should grow under such conditions.\nThe disparity of our ages and gifts no longer mattered.  The pleasant\nland of play is a democracy where such things do not count.",
        "We celebrated his seventy-first birthday by playing billiards all day.\nHe invented a new game for the occasion, and added a new rule for it with\nalmost every shot.  It happened that no other member of the family was at\nhome–ill-health had banished every one, even the secretary.  Flowers,\ntelegrams, and congratulations came, and a string of callers.  He saw no\none but a few intimate friends.",
        "We were entirely alone for dinner, and I felt the great honor of being\nhis only guest on such an occasion.  On that night, a year before, the\nflower of his profession had assembled to do him honor.  Once between the\ncourses, when he rose, as was his habit, to walk about, he wandered into\nthe drawing-room, and, seating himself at the orchestrelle, began to play\nthe beautiful “Flower Song” from Faust.  It was a thing I had not seen\nhim do before, and I never saw him do it again.\nHe was in his loveliest humor all that day and evening, and at night when\nwe stopped playing he said:",
        "“I have never had a pleasanter day at this game.”",
        "I answered: “I hope ten years from to-night we shall be playing it.”",
        "“Yes,” he said, “still playing the best game on earth.”",
