        "\n\n",
        "The epic so brief, so exciting, so full of wonder had now reached its\nclimax. Whatever we may think on the question as to whether Jeanne had\nnow reached the limit of her commission, it is at least evident that\nshe had reached the highest point of her triumph, and that her short\nday of glory and success came to an end in the great act which she had\nalways spoken of as her chief object. She had crowned her King; she\nhad recovered for him one of the richest of his provinces, and\nestablished a strong base for further action on his part. She had\ntaught Frenchmen how not to fly before the English, and she had filled\nthose stout-hearted English, who for a time had the Frenchmen in their\npowerful steel-clad grip, with terror and panic, and taught them how\nto fly in their turn. This was, from the first, what she had said she\nwas appointed to do, and not one of her promises had been broken. Her\ncareer had been a short one, begun in April, ending in July, one brief\ncontinuous course of glory. But this triumphant career had come to its\nconclusion. The messenger of God had done her work; the servant must\nnot desire to be greater than his Lord. There have been heroes in this\nworld whose career has continued a glorious and a happy one to the\nend. Our hearts follow them in their noble career, but when the strain\nand pain are over they come into their kingdom and reap their reward\nthe interest fails. We are glad, very glad, that they should live\nhappy ever after, but their happiness does not attract us like their\nstruggle.",
        "It is different with those whose work and whose motives are not those\nof this world. When they step out of the brilliant lights of triumph\ninto sorrow and suffering, all that is most human in us rises to\nfollow the bleeding feet, our hearts swell with indignation, with\nsorrow and love, and that instinctive admiration for the noble and\npure, which proves that our birthright too is of Heaven, however we\nmay tarnish or even deny that highest pedigree. The chivalrous romance\nof that age would have made of Jeanne d’Arc the heroine of human\nstory. She would have had a noble lover, say our young Guy de Laval,\nor some other generous and brilliant Seigneur of France, and after her\nachievements she would have laid by her sword, and clothed herself\nwith the beautiful garments of the age, and would have grown to be a\nnoble lady in some half regal chateau, to which her name would have\ngiven new lustre. The young reader will probably long that it should\nbe so; he will feel it an injustice, a wrong to humanity that so\ngenerous a soul should have no reward; it will seem to him almost a\npersonal injury that there should not be a noble chevalier at hand to\nsnatch that devoted Maid out of the danger that threatened her, out of\nthe horrible fate that befell her; and we can imagine a generous boy,\nand enthusiastic girl, ready to gnash their teeth at the terrible and\ndishonouring thought that it was by English hands that this noble\ncreature was tied to the stake and perished in the flames. For the\nlast it becomes us[1] to repent, for it was to our everlasting shame;\nbut not more to us than to France who condemned her, who lifted no\nfinger to help her, who raised not even a cry, a protest, against the\ncruelty and wrong. But for her fate in itself let us not mourn over-\nmuch. Had the Maid become a great and honoured lady should not we all\nhave said as Satan says in the Book of Job: Did Jeanne serve God for\nnought? We should say: See what she made by it. Honour and fame and\nlove and happiness. She did nobly, but nobly has she been rewarded.",
        "But that is not God’s way. The highest saint is born to martyrdom. To\nserve God for nought is the greatest distinction which He reserves for\nHis chosen. And this was the fate to which the Maid of France was\nconsecrated from the moment she set out upon her mission. She had the\nsupreme glory of accomplishing that which she believed herself to be\nsent to do, and which I also believe she was sent to do, miraculously,\nby means undreamed of, and in which no one beforehand could have\nbelieved. But when that was done a higher consecration awaited her.\nShe had to drink of the cup of which our Lord drank, and to be\nbaptised with the baptism with which He was baptised. It was involved\nin every step of the progress that it should be so. And she was\nherself aware of it, vaguely, at heart, as soon as the object of her\nmission was attained. What else could have put the thought of dying\ninto the mind of a girl of eighteen in the midst of the adoring crowd,\nto whom to see her, to touch her, was a benediction? When she went\nforth from those gates she was going to her execution, though the end\nwas not to be yet. There was still a long struggle before her,\nlingering and slow, more bitter than death, the preface of\ndiscouragement, of disappointment, of failure when she had most hoped\nto succeed.",
        "She was on the threshold of this second period when she rode out of\nRheims all brilliant in the summer weather, her banner faded now, but\nglorious, her shining armour bearing signs of warfare, her end\nachieved–yet all the while her heart troubled, uncertain, and full of\nunrest. And it is impossible not to note that from this time her plans\nwere less defined than before. Up to the coronation she had known\nexactly what she meant to do, and in spite of all obstructions had\ndone it, keeping her genial humour and her patience, steering her\nsimple way through all the intrigues of the Court, without bitterness\nand without fear. But now a vague mist seems to fall about the path\nwhich was so open and so clear. Paris! Yes, the best policy, the true\ngeneralship would have been to march straight upon Paris, to lose no\ntime, to leave as little leisure as possible to the intriguers to\nresume their old plots. So the generals thought as well as Jeanne: but\nthe courtiers were not of that mind. The weak and foolish notion of\nfalling back upon what they had gained, and of contenting themselves\nwith that, was all they thought of; and the un-French, unpatriotic\ntemper of Paris which wanted no native king, but was content with the\nforeigner, gave them a certain excuse. We could not even imagine\nLondon as being ever, at any time, contented with an alien rule. But\nParis evidently was so, and was ready to defend itself to the death\nagainst its lawful sovereign. Jeanne had never before been brought\nface to face with such a complication. It had been a straightforward\nstruggle, each man for his own side, up to this time. But now other\nthings had to be taken into consideration. Here was no faithful\nOrleans holding out eager arms to its deliverer, but a crafty, self-\nseeking city, deaf to patriotism, indifferent to freedom, calculating\nwhich was most to its profit–and deciding that the stranger, with\nPhilip of Burgundy at his back, was the safer guide. This was enough\nof itself to make a simple mind pause in astonishment and dismay.",
        "There is no evidence that the supernatural leaders who had shaped the\ncourse of the Maid failed her now. She still heard her “voices.” She\nstill held communion with the three saints who, she believed devoutly,\ncame out of Heaven to aid her. The whole question of this supernatural\nguidance is one which is of course open to discussion. There are many\nin these days who do not believe in it at all, who believe in the\nexaltation of Jeanne’s brain, in the excitement of her nerves, in some\nstrange complication of bodily conditions, which made her believe she\nsaw and heard what she did not really see or hear. For our part, we\nconfess frankly that these explanations are no explanation at all so\nfar as we are concerned; we are far more inclined to believe that the\nMaid spoke truth, she who never told a lie, she who fulfilled all the\npromises she made in the name of her guides, than that those people\nare right who tell us on their own authority that such interpositions\nof Heaven are impossible. Nobody in Jeanne’s day doubted that Heaven\ndid interpose directly in human affairs. The only question was, Was it\nHeaven in this instance? Was it not rather the evil one? Was it\nsorcery and witchcraft, or was it the agency of God? The English\nbelieved firmly that it was witchcraft; they could not imagine that it\nwas God, the God of battles, who had always been on their side, who\nnow took the courage out of their hearts and taught their feet to fly\nfor the first time. It was the devil, and the Maid herself was a\nwicked witch. Neither one side nor the other believed that it was from\nJeanne’s excited nerves that these great things came. There were\nplenty of women with excited nerves in France, nerves much more\nexcited than those of Jeanne, who was always reasonable at the height\nof her inspiration; but to none of them did it happen to mount the\nbreach, to take the city, to drive the enemy–up to that moment\ninvincible,–flying from the field.",
        "But it would seem as if these celestial visitants had no longer a\nclear and definite message for the Maid. Their words, which she\nquotes, were now promises of support, vague warnings of trouble to\ncome. “Fear not, for God will stand by you.” She thought they meant\nthat she would be delivered in safety as she had been hitherto, her\nwounds healing, her sacred person preserved from any profane touch.\nBut yet such promises have always something enigmatical in them, and\nit might be, as proved to be the case, that they meant rather\nconsolation and strength to endure than deliverance. For the first\ntime the Maid was often sad; she feared nothing, but the shadow was\nheavy on her heart. Orleans and Rheims had been clear as daylight, her\n“voices” had said to her “Do this” and she had done it. Now there was\nno definite direction. She had to judge for herself what was best, and\nto walk in darkness, hoping that what she did was what she was meant\nto do, but with no longer any certainty. This of itself was a great\nchange, and one which no doubt she felt to her heart. M. Fabre tells\n(alone among the biographers of Jeanne) that there were symptoms of\ndanger to her sound and steady mind, in her words and ways during the\nmoment of triumph. Her chaplain Pasquerel wrote a letter in her name\nto the Hussites, against whom the Pope was then sending crusades, in\nwhich “I, the Maid,” threatened, if they were not converted, to come\nagainst them and give them the alternative of death or amendment.\nQuicherat says that to the Count d’Armagnac who had written to her,\nwhether in good faith or bad, to ask which of the three then existent\nPopes was the real one, she is reported to have answered that she\nwould tell him as soon as the English left her free to do so. But this\nis a perverted account of what she really did say, and M. Fabre seems\nto be, like the rest of us, a little confused in his dates: and the\ndocuments themselves on which he builds are not of unquestioned\nauthority. These, however, would be but small speck upon the sunshine\nof her perfect humility and sobriety; if indeed they are to be\ndepended upon as authentic at all.",
        "The day of Jeanne, her time of glory and success, was but a short one\n–Orleans was delivered on the 8th of May, the coronation of Charles\ntook place on the 17th of July; before the earliest of these dates she\nhad spent nearly two months in an anxious yet hopeful struggle of\npreparation, before she was permitted to enter upon her career. The\ntime of her discouragement was longer. It was ten months from the day\nwhen she rode out of Rheims, the 25th of July, 1429, till the 23d of\nMay, 1430, when she was taken. She had said after the deliverance of\nOrleans that she had but a year in which to accomplish her work, and\nat a later period, Easter, 1430, her “voices” told her that “before\nthe St. Jean” she would be in the power of her enemies. Both these\nstatements came true. She rose quickly but fell more slowly,\nstruggling along upon the downward course, unable to carry out what\nshe would, hampered on every hand, and not apparently followed with\nthe same fervour as of old. It is true that the principal cause of all\nseems to have been the schemes of the Court and the indolence of\nCharles; but all these hindrances had existed before, and the King and\nhis treacherous advisers had been unwillingly dragged every mile of\nthe way, though every step made had been to Charles’s advantage. But\nnow though the course is still one of victory the Maid no longer seems\nto be either the chief cause or the immediate leader. Perhaps this may\nbe partly due to the fact that little fighting was necessary, town\nafter town yielding to the King, which reduced the part of Jeanne to\nthat of a spectator; but there is a change of atmosphere and tone\nwhich seems to point to something more fundamental than this. The\nhistorians are very unwilling to acknowledge, except Michelet who does\nso without hesitation, that she had herself fixed the term of her\ncommission as ending at Rheims; it is certain that she said many\nthings which bear this meaning, and every fact of her after career\nseems to us to prove it: but it is also true that her conviction\nwavered, and other sayings indicate a different belief or hope. She\ndid no wrong in following the profession of arms in which she had made\nso glorious a beginning; she had many gifts and aptitudes for it of\nwhich she was not herself at first aware: but she was no longer the\nEnvoy of God. Enough had been done to arouse the old spirit of France,\nto break the spell of the English supremacy; it was right and fitting\nthat France should do the rest for herself. Perhaps Jeanne was not\nherself very clear on this point, and after her first statement of it,\nbecame less assured. It is not necessary that the servant should know\nthe designs of the master. It did not after all affect her. Her\nbusiness was to serve God to the best of her power, not to take the\nmanagement out of His hands.",
        "The army went forth joyously upon its way, directing itself towards\nParis. There was a pilgrimage to make, such as the Kings of France\nwere in the habit of making after their coronation; there were\npleasant incidents, the submission of a village, the faint resistance,\ninstantly overcome, of a small town, to make the early days pleasant.\nLaon and Soissons both surrendered. Senlis and Beauvais received the\nKing’s envoys with joy. The independent captains of the army made\nlittle circles about, like parties of pleasure, bringing in another\nand another little stronghold to the allegiance of the King. When he\nturned aside, taking as he passed through, without as yet any serious\ndeflection, the road rather to the Loire than to Paris, success still\nattended him. At Château-Thierry resistance was expected to give zest\nto the movement of the forces, but that too yielded at once as the\nothers had done. The dates are very vague and it seems difficult to\nfind any mode of reconciling them. Almost all the historians while\naccusing the King of foolish dilatoriness and confusion of plans give\nus a description of the undefended state of Paris at the moment, which\na sudden stroke on the part of Charles might have carried with little\ndifficulty, during the absence of all the chiefs from the city and the\ngreat terror of the inhabitants; but a comparison of dates shows that\nthe Duke of Bedford re-entered Paris with strong reinforcements on the\nvery day on which Charles left Rheims three days only after his\ncoronation, so that he scarcely seems so much to blame as appears. But\nthe general delay, inefficiency, and hesitation existing at\nheadquarters, naturally lead to mistakes of this kind.",
        "The great point was that Paris itself was by no means disposed to\nreceive the King. Strange as it seems to say so Paris was bitterly,\nfiercely English at that extraordinary moment, a fact which ought to\nbe taken into account as the most important in the whole matter. There\nwas no answering enthusiasm in the capital of France to form an\nauxiliary force behind its ramparts and encourage the besiegers\noutside. The populace perhaps might be indifferent: at the best it had\nno feeling on the subject; but there was no welcome awaiting the King.\nDuring the time of Bedford’s absence the city felt itself to have “no\nlord\"–/ceux de Paris avoit grand peur car nul seigneur n’ y avoit.\nIt was believed that Charles would put all the inhabitants to the\nsword, and their desperation of feeling was rather that which leads to\na wild and hopeless defence than to submission. The Duke of Bedford,\ngoverning in the name of the infant Henry VI. Of England, was their\nseigneur, instead of their natural sovereign. It is a fact which to us\nseems scarcely credible, but it was certainly true. There seems to\nhave been no feeling even, on the subject, no general shame as of a\nnational betrayal; nothing of the kind. Paris was English, holding by\nthe English kings who had never lost a certain hold on France, and\nthinking no shame of its party. It was a hostile town, the chief of\nthe English possessions. In the Journal du Bourgeois de Paris–who\nwas no bourgeois but a distinguished member of that university which\nheld the Maid and all her ways in horror–Jeanne the deliverer, the\nincarnation of patriotism and of France is spoken of as “a creature in\nthe form of a woman.” How extraordinary is this evidence of a state of\naffairs in which it is almost impossible to believe! Paris is France\nnowadays to many people, though no doubt this is but a superficial\njudgment; but in the early part of the fifteenth century, she was\nfrankly English, not by compulsion even, but by habit and policy.\nPerhaps the delays, the hesitation, the terrors of Charles and his\ncounsellors are thus rendered more excusable than by any other\nexplanation.",
        "In the meantime it is almost impossible to follow the wanderings of\nthis vacillating army without a map. If the reader should trace its\nmovements, he would see what a stumbling and devious course it took as\nof a man blundering in the dark. From Rheims to Soissons the way was\nclear; then there came a sudden move southward to Château-Thierry from\nwhich indeed there was still a straight line to Paris but which still\nmore clearly indicated the highroad leading to the Orleannais, the\nfaithful districts of the Loire. This retrograde movement was not made\nwithout a great outcry from the generals. Their opinion was that the\nKing ought to press on to conquer everything while the English forces\nwere still depressed and discouraged. In their mind this deflection\ntowards the south was an abandonment at once of honour and safety. An\nunimportant check on the way, however, gave an argument to the leaders\nof the army, and Charles permitted himself to be dragged back. They\nthen made their way by La Ferté-Milon, Crépy, and Daumartin, and on\nthis road the English troops which had been led out from Paris by\nBedford to intercept them came twice within fighting distance of the\nFrench army. The English, as all the French historians are eager to\ninform us, invariably entrenched themselves in their positions,\nsurrounding their lines with sharp-pointed posts by which the equally\ninvariable rush of the French could be broken. But the French on these\noccasions were too wise to repeat the impetuous charge which had\nruined them at Crécy and Agincourt, and the consequence was that the\ntwo forces remained within sight of each other, with a few skirmishes\ngoing on at the flanks, but without any serious encounter.",
        "It will be more satisfactory, however, to copy the following\nitineraire of Charles’s movements from the Chronicle of Perceval de\nCagny who was a member of the household of the Duc d’Alençon, and\nprobably present, certainly at all events bound to have the best and\nmost correct information. He informs us that the King left Rheims on\nThursday the 21st of July, and dined, supped, and lay at the Abbey of\nSt. Nanuol that night, where were brought to him the keys of the city\nof Laon. He then set out on le voyage à venir devant Paris.",
        "“And on Saturday the 23d of the same month the King dined, supped and\nlay at Soissons, and was there received the most honourably that the\nchurchmen, burghers and other people of the town were capable of: for\nthey had all great fear because of the destruction of the town which\nhad been taken by the Burgundians and made to rebel against the King.",
        "“Friday the 29th day of July the King and his company were all day\nbefore Château-Thierry in order of battle, hoping that the Duke of\nBedford would appear to fight. The place surrendered at the hour of\nvespers, and the King lodged there till Monday the first of August. On\nthat day the King lay at Monmirail in Brie.",
        "“Tuesday the 2d of August he passed the night in the town of Provins,\nand had the best possible reception there, and remained till the\nFriday following, the 5th August. Sunday the 7th the King lay at the\ntown of Coulommièrs in Brie. Wednesday the 10th he lay at La Ferté-\nMilon, Thursday at Crespy in Valois–Friday at Laigny-le-Sec. The\nfollowing Saturday the 13th the King held the field near Dammartin-en-\nGouelle, for the whole day looking out for the English: but they came\nnot.",
        "“On Sunday the 14th August the Maid, the Duc d’Alençon, the Count de\nVendosme, the Marshals and other captains accompanied by six or seven\nthousand combatants were at the hour of vespers lodged in the fields\nnear Montépilloy, nearly two leagues from the town of Senlis–The Duke\nof Bedford and other English captains with between eight and ten\nthousand English lying half a league from Senlis between our people\nand the said city on a little stream, in a village called Notre Dame\nde la Victoire. That evening our people skirmished with the English\nnear to their camp and in this skirmish were people taken on each\nside, and of the English Captain d’Orbec and ten or twelve others, and\npeople wounded on both sides: when night fell each retired to their\nown quarters.”",
        "The same writer records an appeal in the true tone of chivalry\naddressed to the English by Jeanne and Alençon desiring them to come\nout from their entrenchments and fight: and promising to withdraw to a\nsufficient distance to permit the enemy to place himself in the open\nfield. The French troops had first “put themselves in the best state\nof conscience that could possibly be, hearing mass at an early hour\nand then to horse.” But the English would not come out. Jeanne, with\nher standard in her hand rode up to the English entrenchments, and\nsome one says (not de Cagny) struck the posts with her banner,\nchallenging the force within to come out and fight; while they on\ntheir side waved at the French in defiance, a standard copied from\nthat of Jeanne, on which was depicted a distaff and spindle. But\nneither host approached any nearer. Finally, Charles made his way to\nCompiègne.",
        "At Château-Thierry there was concluded an arrangement with Philip of\nBurgundy for a truce of fifteen days, before the end of which time the\nDuke undertook to deliver Paris peaceably to the French. That this was\nsimply to gain time and that no idea of giving up Paris had ever been\nentertained is evident; perhaps Charles was not even deceived. He, no\nmore than Philip, had any desire to encounter the dangers of such a\nsiege. But he was able at least to silence the clamours of the army\nand the representations of the persistent Maid by this truce. To wait\nfor fifteen days and receive the prize without a blow struck, would\nnot that be best? The counsellors of the King held thus a strong\nposition, though the delay made the hearts of the warriors sick.",
        "The figure of Jeanne appears during these marchings and counter-\nmarchings like that of any other general, pursuing a skilful but not\nunusual plan of campaign. That she did well and bravely there can be\nno doubt, and there is a characteristic touch which we recognise, in\nthe fact that she and all of her company “put themselves in the best\nstate of conscience that could be,” before they took to horse; but the\nskirmishes and repulses are such as Alençon himself might have made.\n“She made much diligence,” the same chronicler tells us, “to reduce\nand place many towns in the obedience of the King,” but so did many\nothers with like success. We hear no more her vigorous knock at the\ndoor of the council chamber if the discussion there was too long or\nthe proceedings too secret. Her appearances are those of a general\namong many other generals, no longer with any special certainty in her\nmovements as of a person inspired. We are reminded of a story told of\na previous period, after the fight at Patay, when blazing forth in the\nindignation of her youthful purity at the sight of one of the camp\nfollowers, a degraded woman with some soldiers, she struck the wanton\nwith the flat of her sword, driving her forth from the camp, where was\nno longer that chastened army of awed and reverent soldiers making\ntheir confession on the eve of every battle, whom she had led to\nOrleans. The sword she used on this occasion, was, it is said, the\nmiraculous sword which had been found under the high altar of St.\nCatharine at Fierbois; but at the touch of the unclean the maiden\nbrand broke in two. If this was an allegory[2] to show that the work\nof that weapon was over, and the common sword of the soldier enough\nfor the warfare that remained, it could not be more clearly realised\nthan in the history of this campaign. The only touch of our real Maid\nin her own distinct person comes to us in a letter written in a field\non that same wavering road to Paris, dated as early as the 5th of\nAugust and addressed to the good people of Rheims, some of whom had\nevidently written to her to ask what was the meaning of the delay, and\nwhether she had given up the cause of the country. There is a terse\ndetermination in its brief, indignant sentences which is a relief to\nthe reader weary of the wavering and purposeless campaign:",
        " “Dear and good friends, good and loyal Frenchmen of the town of\n  Rheims. Jeanne, the Maid, sends you news of her. It is true that\n  the King has made a truce of fifteen days with the Duke of\n  Burgundy, who promises to render peaceably the city of Paris in\n  that time. Do not, however, be surprised if I enter there sooner,\n  for I like not truces so made, and know not whether I will keep\n  them, but if I keep them, it will be only because of the honour of\n  the King.”",
        "While Jeanne and her army thus played with the unmoving English,\nadvancing and retiring, attempting every means of drawing them out,\nthe enemy took advantage of one of these seeming withdrawals to march\nout of their camp suddenly and return to Paris, which all this time\nhad been lying comparatively defenceless, had the French made their\nattack sooner. At the same time Charles moved on to Compiègne where he\ngave himself up to fresh intrigues with Philip of Burgundy, this time\nfor a truce to last till Christmas. The Maid was grievously troubled\nby this step, moult marrie, and by the new period of delay and\nnegotiation on which the Court had entered. Paris was not given up,\nnor was there any appearance that it ever would be, and to all the\ngenerals as well as to the Maid it was very evident that this was the\nnext step to be taken. Some of the leaders wearied with inaction had\npushed on to Normandy where four great fortresses–greatest of all the\nimmense and mysterious stronghold on the high cliffs of the Seine,\nthat imposing Château Gaillard which Richard Cur-de-lion had built,\nthe ruins of which, white and mystic, still dominate, like some\nTitanic ghost, above the course of the river–had yielded to them. So\ngreat was the danger of Normandy, the most securely English of all\nFrench provinces, that Bedford had again been drawn out of Paris to\ndefend it. Here then was another opportunity to seize the capital. But\nCharles could not be induced to move. He found many ways of amusing\nhimself at Compiègne, and the new treaty was being hatched with\nBurgundy which gave an excuse for doing nothing. The pause which\nwearied them all out, both captains and soldiers, at last became more\nthan flesh and blood could bear.",
        "Jeanne once more was driven to take the initiative. Already on one\noccasion she had forced the hand of the lingering Court, and resumed\nthe campaign of her own accord, an impatient movement which had been\nperfectly successful. No doubt again the army itself was becoming\ndemoralised, and showing symptoms of falling to pieces. One day she\nsent for Alençon in haste during the absence of the ambassadors at\nArras. “Beau duc,” she cried, “prepare your troops and the other\ncaptains. En mon Dieu, par mon martin,[3] I will see Paris nearer\nthan I have yet seen it.” She had seen the towers from afar as she\nwandered over the country in Charles’s lingering train. Her sudden\nresolution struck like fire upon the impatient band. They set out at\nonce, Alençon and the Maid at the head of their division of the army,\nand all rejoiced to get to horse again, to push their way through\nevery obstacle. They started on the 23d August, nearly a month after\nthe departure from Rheims, a month entirely lost, though full of\nevents, lost without remedy so far as Paris was concerned. At Senlis\nthey made a pause, perhaps to await the King, who, it was hoped, would\nhave been constrained to follow; then carrying with them all the\nforces that could be spared from that town, they spurred on to St.\nDenis where they arrived on the 27th: St. Denis, the other sacred town\nof France, the place of the tomb, as Rheims was the place of the\ncrown.",
        "The royalty of France was Jeanne’s passion. I do not say the King,\nwhich might be capable of malinterpretation, but the kings, the\nmonarchy, the anointed of the Lord, by whom France was represented,\nembodied and made into a living thing. She had loved Rheims, its\nassociations, its triumphs, the rejoicing of its citizens. These had\nbeen the accompaniments of her own highest victory. She came to St.\nDenis in a different mood, her heart hot with disappointment and the\nthwarting of all her plans. From whatever cause it might spring, it\nwas clear that she was no longer buoyed up by that certainty which\nonly a little while before had carried her through every danger and\nover every obstacle. But to have reached St. Denis at least was\nsomething. It was a place doubly sacred, consecrated to that royal\nHouse for which she would so willingly have given her life. And at\nlast she was within sight of Paris, the greatest prize of all. Up to\nthis time she had known in actual warfare nothing but victory. If her\nheart for the first time wavered and feared, there was still no\ncertain reason that, de par Dieu, she might not win the day again.",
        "At St. Denis there was once more a cruel delay. Nearly a fortnight\npassed and there was no news of the King. The Maid employed the time\nin skirmishes and reconnoissances, but does not seem to have ventured\non an attack without the sanction of Charles, whom Alençon, finally,\ngoing back on two several occasions, succeeded in setting in motion.\nCharles had remained at Compiègne to carry out his treaty with\nBurgundy, and the last thing he desired was this attack; but when he\ncould resist no longer he moved on reluctantly to St. Denis, where his\narrival was hailed with great delight. This was not until the 5th of\nSeptember, and the army, wrought up to a high pitch of excitement and\nexpectation, was eager for the fight. “There was no one of whatever\ncondition, who did not say, ’She will lead the King into Paris, if he\nwill let her,’” says the chronicler.",
        "In the meantime the authorities in Paris were at work, strengthening\nits fortifications, frightening the populace with threats of the\nvengeance of Charles, persuading every citizen of the danger of\nsubmission.",
        "The Bourgeois tells us that letters came from “les Arminoz,” that\nis, the party of the King, sealed with the seal of the Duc d’Alençon,\nand addressed to the heads of the city guilds and municipality\ninviting their co-operation as Frenchmen. “But,” adds the Parisian,\n“it was easy to see through their meaning, and an answer was returned\nthat they need not throw away their paper as no attention was paid to\nit.” There is no sign at all that any national feeling existed to\nrespond to such an appeal. Paris–its courts of law, Parliaments\n(salaried by Bedford), University, Church–every department, was\nEnglish in the first place, Burgundian in the second, dependent on\nEnglish support and money. There was no French party existing. The\nMaid was to them an evil sorceress, a creature in the form of a woman,\nexercising the blackest arts. Perhaps there was even a breath of\nconsciousness in the air that Charles himself had no desire for the\nfall of the city. He had left the Parisians full time to make every\npreparation, he had held back as long as was possible. His favour was\nall on the side of his enemies; for his own forces and their leaders,\nand especially for the Maid, he had nothing but discouragement,\ndistrust, and auguries of evil.",
        "Nevertheless, these oppositions came to an end, and Jeanne, though\nless ready and eager for the assault, found herself under the walls of\nParis at last.\n\n[1] “The English, not US,” says Mr. Andrew Lang: and it is pleasant to\n    a Scot to know that this is true. England and Scotland were then\n    twain, and the Scots fought in the ranks of our auld Ally. But for\n    the present age the distinction lasts no longer, and to the writer\n    of an English book on English soil it would be ungenerous to take\n    the advantage.\n[2] It is taken as a miraculous sign by another chronicler, Jean\n    Chartier, who tells us that when this fact came to the knowledge\n    of the King the sword was given by him to the workmen to be re-\n    founded–\"but they could not do it, nor put the pieces together\n    again: which is a great proof (/grant approbation) that the sword\n    came to her divinely. And it is notorious that since the breaking\n    of that sword, the said Jeanne neither prospered in arms to the\n    profit of the King nor otherwise as she had done before.”\n[3] “It was her oath,” adds the chronicler; no one is quite sure what\n    it means, but Quicherat is of opinion that it was her baton, her\n    stick or staff. Perceval de Cagny puts in this exclamation in\n    almost all the speeches of the Maid. It must have struck him as a\n    curious adjuration. Perhaps it explains why La Hire, unable to do\n    without something to swear by, was permitted by Jeanne in their\n    frank and humorous camaraderie to swear by his stick, the same\n    rustic oath.\nContinue...
