        "There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very\nyoung, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships\nthen making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his\nwealth, in the hope of making great gains, when the news came that\nboth were lost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so\nvery poor that nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and\nthere he often went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind\nof a little of his trouble.",
        "One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no\ngreat comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to\nbe, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking,\nblack dwarf. ’Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?’ said he to the\nmerchant; ’what is it you take so deeply to heart?’ ’If you would do\nme any good I would willingly tell you,’ said the merchant. ’Who knows\nbut I may?’ said the little man: ’tell me what ails you, and perhaps\nyou will find I may be of some use.’ Then the merchant told him how\nall his wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had\nnothing left but that little plot of land. ’Oh, trouble not yourself\nabout that,’ said the dwarf; ’only undertake to bring me here, twelve\nyears hence, whatever meets you first on your going home, and I will\ngive you as much as you please.’ The merchant thought this was no\ngreat thing to ask; that it would most likely be his dog or his cat,\nor something of that sort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he\nagreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to do what was\nasked of him.",
        "But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that\nhe crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in\nhis face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and\nhorror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no\ngold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a\njoke that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the\nmoney came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.",
        "About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look\nfor some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and\nthere, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the\nfloor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about\nhis son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than\nbefore.",
        "Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years\ndrew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very\nsad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his\nface. The boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would\nnot tell for some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without\nknowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf,\nand that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his\nword. Then Heinel said, ’Father, give yourself very little trouble\nabout that; I shall be too much for the little man.’",
        "When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place\nagreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself\nand his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came,\nand walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any\nway to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over\nit. At last the boy said to him. ’Have you anything to say to us, my\nfriend, or what do you want?’ Now Heinel had found a friend in a good\nfairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this\nfairy knew what good luck was in store for him. ’Have you brought me\nwhat you said you would?’ said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man\nheld his tongue, but Heinel said again, ’What do you want here?’ The\ndwarf said, ’I come to talk with your father, not with you.’ ’You have\ncheated and taken in my father,’ said the son; ’pray give him up his\nbond at once.’ ’Fair and softly,’ said the little old man; ’right is\nright; I have paid my money, and your father has had it, and spent it;\nso be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.’ ’You must have my\nconsent to that first,’ said Heinel, ’so please to step in here, and\nlet us talk it over.’ The old man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if\nhe should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could. Then\nat last, after a long talk, they came to terms. Heinel agreed that his\nfather must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have his\nway: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune\nwas in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not\nchoose to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious\nfor his company.",
        "So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that\nHeinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard\nby; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he\nshould thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind\nand weather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the\nboat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one\nside low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was\nlost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way,\nthinking that at any rate he had had his revenge.",
        "The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her\nfriend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The\nyoung man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an\nunknown land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a\nbeautiful castle but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted.\n’Here,’ said he to himself, ’must I find the prize the good fairy told\nme of.’ So he once more searched the whole palace through, till at\nlast he found a white snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of\nthe chambers.",
        "Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad\nto see him, and said, ’Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve\nlong years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she\npromised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come:\ntheir faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.\nThey will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do\nwhat they will–beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you–bear all;\nonly speak not a word, and at twelve o’clock they must go away. The\nsecond night twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four,\nwho will even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night\ntheir power is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you\nthe Water of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to\nlife and health.’ And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore\nall, and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and\nfell on his neck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth\nthroughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned\nking of the Golden Mountain.",
        "They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus\neight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his\nfather; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was\nagainst his going, and said, ’I know well that misfortunes will come\nupon us if you go.’ However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At\nhis going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, ’Take this ring,\nand put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only\npromise never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father’s\nhouse.’ Then he said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on\nhis finger, and wished himself near the town where his father lived.",
        "Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would\nnot let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to\na neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old\nfrock, and thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his\nfather’s house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not\nbelieve him, and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he\nknew was long since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor\nshepherd, he would not even give him anything to eat. The king,\nhowever, still vowed that he was his son, and said, ’Is there no mark\nby which you would know me if I am really your son?’ ’Yes,’ said his\nmother, ’our Heinel had a mark like a raspberry on his right arm.’\nThen he showed them the mark, and they knew that what he had said was\ntrue.",
        "He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was\nmarried to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant\nsaid, ’that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels\nabout in a shepherd’s frock!’ At this the son was vexed; and forgetting\nhis word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an\ninstant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had\nbroken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to\nsoothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in\ntruth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.",
        "One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her\nthe spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he\nsat himself down, and said, ’I am very much tired; sit by me, I will\nrest my head in your lap, and sleep a while.’ As soon as he had fallen\nasleep, however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly\naway, and wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And\nwhen he awoke he found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone\nfrom his finger. ’I can never go back to my father’s house,’ said he;\n’they would say I am a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world,\ntill I come again to my kingdom.’",
        "So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three\ngiants were sharing their father’s goods; and as they saw him pass\nthey cried out and said, ’Little men have sharp wits; he shall part\nthe goods between us.’ Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy’s\nhead whenever the wearer gave the words, ’Heads off!’; a cloak that\nmade the owner invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair\nof boots that carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they\nmust first let him try these wonderful things, then he might know how\nto set a value upon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished\nhimself a fly, and in a moment he was a fly. ’The cloak is very well,’\nsaid he: ’now give me the sword.’ ’No,’ said they; ’not unless you\nundertake not to say, “Heads off!” for if you do we are all dead men.’\nSo they gave it him, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked\nfor the boots also; and the moment he had all three in his power, he\nwished himself at the Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So\nthe giants were left behind with no goods to share or quarrel about.",
        "As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and\nthe people around told him that his queen was about to marry another\nhusband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the\ncastle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one\nsaw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it\naway and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her,\nhe took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat\nand drink, her plate and cup were always empty.",
        "Upon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her\nchamber alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there.\n’Alas!’ said she to herself, ’was I not once set free? Why then does\nthis enchantment still seem to bind me?’",
        "’False and fickle one!’ said he. ’One indeed came who set thee free,\nand he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to\nhave had such treatment from thee?’ Then he went out and sent away the\ncompany, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back\nto the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.\nHowever, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them\nif they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried\nto seize him; but he drew his sword. ’Heads Off!’ cried he; and with\nthe word the traitors’ heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more\nking of the Golden Mountain.",
