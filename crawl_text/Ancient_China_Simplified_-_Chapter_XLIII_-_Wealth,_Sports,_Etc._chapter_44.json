        "A traveller in modern China may still wonder at the utter absence\nof any sign of wealth or luxury except in the very largest towns.\nFine clothes, jewels, concubines, rich food, aphrodisiacs, opium,\nland, cattle–these represent “wealth” as conceived by the Chinese\nrich man’s mind. In 655 Ts’in is said to have paid five ram-skins\nto Ts’u in order to secure the services of a coveted adviser. Not\nmany years after that, when the future Second Protector was making\nhis terms with the King of Ts’u, he remarked: “What can I do for\nyou in return? You already possess all the slaves, musicians,\ntreasures, silks, feathers, ivory, and leather you can want.” In\n606 a magnificent turtle was sent as a new year’s dinner present\nfrom Ts’u to Cheng; in modern China this form of politeness would\nnever do at all, as the turtle has acquired an evil reputation as\na term of abuse, akin to the Spanish use or abuse of the word\n“garlic”: however, I myself once experienced, when inland, far\naway from the sea, a curious compliment in the shape of a live\ncrab two inches long (sent to me as a great honour) in a small\njar. Of course chairs were unknown, and even the highest sat or\nsquatted on mats; not necessarily on the ground, but spread on\ncouches. Hence the word survives the object, just as with us\n(\"covers” at dinner are “provided” but never seen; thus in China a\nhost is “east mat” and a guest “west mat.”) In 626, when the ruler\nof Ts’in was talking politics with the Tartar envoy just mentioned\nabove, he allowed him, as a special favour, to sit alongside of\nhis own mat (on the couch). These couches probably resembled the\nmodern settee, sofa, k’ang, or divan, such as all visitors\nto China have seen and sat on. Tea was quite unknown in those\ndays, and is not mentioned before the seventh century A.D.; but\npossibly wine may have been served, as tea is now, on a low table\nbetween the two seats. “Tartar couches” (possibly Turkish divans)\nare frequently mentioned, even in the field of battle, and in\ncomparatively modern times. In 300 B.C. Ts’u made a present to a\ndistinguished renegade prince of the Ts’i house of an “elephant\ncouch,” by which is probably meant a couch inlaid with ivory, in\nthe present well-known Annamese style.",
        "In 589 B.C., when Tsin troops reached the Ts’i capital and the sea\n(as already related in Chapters VI. and XXXIX. under the heads of\nArmies and Geographical Knowledge), T’si endeavoured to purchase\npeace by offering to the victor the state treasure in the shape of\nprecious utensils. In 551 a rich man of Ts’u was considered\ninsolently showy because he possessed forty horses. In 545 the\nenvoy from Cheng, acting under the Peace Conference agreement so\noften previously described and alluded to, brings presents of furs\nand silks to Ts’u; and in 537 Tsin speaks of such articles as\noften being presented to Ts’u. In 494, when the King of Yiieh\nreceived his great defeat at the hands of the King of Wu, his\nfirst desperate idea was to kill his wives and children, burn his\nvaluables, and seek death at the head of his troops; but the\ninevitable wily Chinese adviser was at hand, and the King ended by\ntaking his mentor’s advice and successfully bribing the Wu general\n(a Ts’u renegade) with presents of women and valuables. When this\nshrewd Chinese adviser of the Yueh king had, by his sagacious\ncounsels, at last secured the final defeat of Wu, he packed up his\nportable valuables, pearls, and jades, collected his family and\nclients, and went away by sea, never to come back. As a matter of\nfact, he settled in Ts’i, where he made an enormous fortune in the\nfish trade, and ultimately became the traditional Croesus of\nChina, his name being quite as well known to modern Chinese\nthrough the Confucian historians, as the name of Croesus is to\nmodern Europeans through Herodotus. He had, between the two\ndefeats of Yiieh by Wu and Wu by Yiieh, served for several years\nas a spy in Wu, and the fact of his reaching Shan Tung by sea\nconfirms in principle the story of the family of his contemporary,\nthe King of Wu, having similarly escaped to Japan. The place where\nhe landed was probably the same as where the celebrated pilgrim\nFah Hien landed, after his Indian pilgrimage, in 415 A.D., i.e.,\nat the German port of Ts’ing-tao.",
        "We do not hear much of gold in the earlier times, but in 237 B.C.,\nwhen Ts’in was straining every nerve to conquer China, the\n(future) First August Emperor was advised that “it would not cost\nmore than 300,000 pounds weight in gold to bribe the ministers of\nall the states in league against Ts’in.” Yet in 643 B.C., on the\ndeath of the First Protector, the orthodox state of Cheng (lying\nbetween Ts’i and Tsin to the north and Ts’u to the south), was\nbribed with “metal” of some sort–probably gold or silver–to\nabandon Ts’i. In 538 the celebrated Cheng statesman Tsz-ch’an\ninforms his Ts’u colleagues that the Tsin officers “think of\nnothing but money.” What kind of money this was is doubtful, but\nit will be remembered that about this time the “powerful family\"\nof Lu had succeeded in bribing the Tsin ministers, or the “six\ngreat families” then managing Tsin, to deny justice to the\nfugitive Lu duke. In 513 B.C. the powerful Wu king who made\n(modern) Soochow his capital is said to have possessed both iron\nand gold mines, and it is stated that not even China proper could\nturn out better weapons. Large “cash” are said to have been coined\nby the Emperor who reigned from 540 to 520 B.C.; and in 450 B.C.\nthe King of Ts’u is reported to have “closed his depot of\nthe three moneys.” As only copper was coined, it is not easy to\nsay now what the other two “moneys” were. In 318 B.C. a bribe of\n“one hundred golds” was given by Yen to one of the well-known\npolitical diplomats or intriguers then forming leagues with or\nagainst Ts’in; it is not known for certain how much this was at\nthat particular time and place; but a century or two later it\nmeant, under the Ts’in dynasty, twenty-four ounces; during the Han\ndynasty, conquerors of the Ts’in dynasty, it was only about half\nthat. Cooks seem to have held official positions of considerable\ndignity. “Meat-eaters” in Confucian times was a term for\n“officials” or “the rich.” Thus when the haughty King of Wu was\nsuddenly recalled home, from his high-handed durbar with Tsin, Lu,\nand other orthodox states, to go and deal with his formidable\nenemy of Yueh, he turned quite pale. By dint of bold “bluff” he\nmanaged after all to gain most of his political points, and to\nretire from an awkward corner with honour; but Chinese spies had\ntheir eyes on him none the less, and reported to the watchful\nenemy that “meat-eaters are not usually blackfaced\"–meaning that\nthe King of Wu evidently had some very recent bad news on his\nmind, for “the well-fed do not usually look care-worn.”",
        "Silk was universally known. When the Second Protector (to be) was\ndallying with his lady-love in Ts’i, the maid of his mistress\nhappened to overhear important conversations from her post in a\nmulberry tree; the presumption is that she was collecting leaves\nfor the silkworms. Again in 519, a century later, there was a\ndispute on the Ts’u-Wu frontier (North An Hwei province), about\nthe possession of certain mulberry trees. Cotton (Gossypium)\nwas unknown in China, and the poorer classes wore garments of\nhempen materials; the cotton tree (Bombyx) was known in\nthe south, but then (as now) the catkins could not be woven\ninto cloth. It was never the custom of officers in China to wear\nswords, until in 409 B.C. Ts’in introduced the practice; but it\nprobably never extended to orthodox China, so far, at least, as\ncivilians’ were concerned. The three dynasties of Hia, Shang, and\nChou had all made use of jade or malachite rings, tablets,\nsceptres, and so on, as marks of official rank.",
        "As to sports, hunting, and especially fowling, seem to have been\nthe most popular pastimes. In 660 a prince of Wei (orthodox) is\nsaid to have had a passion for egret fights. In 539 four-horsed\nchariots are mentioned as being used in a great Ts’u hunt south of\nthe modern Teh-an in northern Hu Peh province, then mostly jungle:\nthese hunts were used as a sort of training for war as well as for\nsport. The celebrated “stone drums” discovered in the seventh\ncentury A.D. near the old Chou capital describe the war-hunts of\nthe active emperor mentioned in Chapter XLI. As might be expected,\nYen (Peking plain) would be well off for horses-to this day\nbrought by the Mongols in droves to Peking: in 539 it is said of\nYen: “She was never a strong power, in spite of her numerous\nhorses.” In 534 a great hunt in Lu is described with much detail;\nhere also chariots were used, and their shafts were reared in\nopposite rows with their tips meeting above, so as to form a\n“shaft gate,” on which, besides, a flag was kept flying. The\nentrance to Chinese official yamens is still called “the\nshaft gate\";-in fact, the ya was orginally a flag, and “yamen“\nsimply means “flag gate.” In the Middle Ages the Turkish Khans’\nencampments were always spoken of as their ya–thus: “from\nhence 1500 miles north-west to the Khan’s ya.” Cockfighting\nwas a common sport in Ts’i and Lu. In 517 B.C. two prominent\nLu functionaries had a quarrel because one had put metal\nspurs on his bird, whilst the other had scattered mustard in the\nfeathers of his fighting cock: owing to the ambiguity or double\nmeaning of one of the pictographs employed, it is not quite\ncertain that “mustard in the wings” may not mean “a metal helmet\non the head.” Lifting weights was (as now) a favourite exercise;\nin 307 a Ts’in prince died from the effects of a strain produced\nin trying to lift a heavy metal tripod. In Ts’i games at ball,\nincluding a kind of football, were played. As a rule, however, it\nis to be feared that the wealthy Chinese classes in ancient (as in\nmodern) times found their chief recreation in feasting, literary\nbouts, and female society. Curiously enough, nothing is said of\ngambling. Women are depicted at their looms, or engaged upon the\nsilk industry; but it is singular how very little is said of home\nlife, of how the houses were constructed, of how the hours of\nleisure were passed. In modern China the bulk of the male rural\npopulation rises with or before the dawn, and is engaged upon\nfield or garden work until the shades of evening fall in; there is\nno artificial light adequate for purposes of needlework or private\nstudy; even the consolations of tobacco and tea–not to say opium,\nand now newspapers–were unknown in Confucian days. It is\npresumed, therefore, that life was even more humdrum than it is\nnow, except that women at least had feet to walk upon. We gain\nsome glimpses of excessive taxation and popular misery, forced\nlabour and the press-gang; of callous luxury on the part of the\nrich, from the pages of Lao-tsz and Mencius; the Book of Odes also\ntells us much about the pathetic sadness of the people under their\ntaskmasters’ hands. In all countries popular habits change slowly;\nin none more so than in China. We are driven, therefore, by\ncomparison with the life of to-day to conclude that life in those\ntimes was sufficiently wretched, and it is therefore not to be\nwondered at that the miserable people readily sold their services\nto the first ambitious adventurer who could protect them, and feed\nthem from day to day.",
