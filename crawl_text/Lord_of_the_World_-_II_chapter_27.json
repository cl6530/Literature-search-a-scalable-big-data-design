        "It was late that night before Percy returned, completely exhausted by\nhis labours. For hour after hour he had sat with the Cardinal, opening\ndespatches that poured into the electric receivers from all over Europe,\nand were brought in one by one into the quiet sitting-room. Three times\nin the afternoon the Cardinal had been sent for, once by the Pope and\ntwice to the Quirinal.",
        "There was no doubt at all that the news was true; and it seemed that\nFelsenburgh must have waited deliberately for the offer. All others he\nhad refused. There had been a Convention of the Powers, each of whom had\nbeen anxious to secure him, and each of whom had severally failed; these\nprivate claims had been withdrawn, and an united message sent. The new\nproposal was to the effect that Felsenburgh should assume a position\nhitherto undreamed of in democracy; that he should receive a House of\nGovernment in every capital of Europe; that his veto of any measure\nshould be final for three years; that any measure he chose to introduce\nthree times in three consecutive years should become law; that his title\nshould be that of President of Europe. From his side practically nothing\nwas asked, except that he should refuse any other official position\noffered him that did not receive the sanction of all the Powers. And all\nthis, Percy saw very well, involved the danger of an united Europe\nincreased tenfold. It involved all the stupendous force of Socialism\ndirected by a brilliant individual. It was the combination of the\nstrongest characteristics of the two methods of government. The offer\nhad been accepted by Felsenburgh after eight hours’ silence.",
        "It was remarkable, too, to observe how the news had been accepted by the\ntwo other divisions of the world. The East was enthusiastic; America was\ndivided. But in any case America was powerless: the balance of the world\nwas overwhelmingly against her.",
        "Percy threw himself, as he was, on to his bed, and lay there with\ndrumming pulses, closed eyes and a huge despair at his heart. The world\nindeed had risen like a giant over the horizons of Rome, and the holy\ncity was no better now than a sand castle before a tide. So much he\ngrasped. As to how ruin would come, in what form and from what\ndirection, he neither knew nor cared. Only he knew now that it would\ncome.",
        "He had learned by now something of his own temperament; and he turned\nhis eyes inwards to observe himself bitterly, as a doctor in mortal\ndisease might with a dreadful complacency diagnose his own symptoms. It\nwas even a relief to turn from the monstrous mechanism of the world to\nsee in miniature one hopeless human heart. For his own religion he no\nlonger feared; he knew, as absolutely as a man may know the colour of\nhis eyes, that it was secure again and beyond shaking. During those\nweeks in Rome the cloudy deposit had run clear and the channel was once\nmore visible. Or, better still, that vast erection of dogma, ceremony,\ncustom and morals in which he had been educated, and on which he had\nlooked all his life (as a man may stare upon some great set-piece that\nbewilders him), seeing now one spark of light, now another, flare and\nwane in the darkness, had little by little kindled and revealed itself\nin one stupendous blaze of divine fire that explains itself. Huge\nprinciples, once bewildering and even repellent, were again luminously\nself-evident; he saw, for example, that while Humanity-Religion\nendeavoured to abolish suffering the Divine Religion embraced it, so\nthat the blind pangs even of beasts were within the Father’s Will and\nScheme; or that while from one angle one colour only of the web of life\nwas visible–material, or intellectual, or artistic–from another the\nSupernatural was as eminently obvious. Humanity-Religion could only be\ntrue if at least half of man’s nature, aspirations and sorrows were\nignored. Christianity, on the other hand, at least included and\naccounted for these, even if it did not explain them. This ... and this\n... and this ... all made the one and perfect whole. There was the\nCatholic Faith, more certain to him than the existence of himself: it\nwas true and alive. He might be damned, but God reigned. He might go\nmad, but Jesus Christ was Incarnate Deity, proving Himself so by death\nand Resurrection, and John his Vicar. These things were as the bones of\nthe Universe–facts beyond doubting–if they were not true, nothing\nanywhere was anything but a dream.",
        "Difficulties?–Why, there were ten thousand. He did not in the least\nunderstand why God had made the world as it was, nor how Hell could be\nthe creation of Love, nor how bread was transubstantiated into the Body\nof God but–well, these things were so. He had travelled far, he began\nto see, from his old status of faith, when he had believed that divine\ntruth could be demonstrated on intellectual grounds. He had learned now\n(he knew not how) that the supernatural cried to the supernatural; the\nChrist without to the Christ within; that pure human reason indeed could\nnot contradict, yet neither could it adequately prove the mysteries of\nfaith, except on premisses visible only to him who receives Revelation\nas a fact; that it is the moral state, rather than the intellectual, to\nwhich the Spirit of God speaks with the greater certitude. That which he\nhad both learned and taught he now knew, that Faith, having, like man\nhimself, a body and a spirit–an historical expression and an inner\nverity–speaks now by one, now by another. This man believes because he\nsees–accepts the Incarnation or the Church from its credentials; that\nman, perceiving that these things are spiritual facts, yields himself\nwholly to the message and authority of her who alone professes them, as\nwell as to the manifestation of them upon the historical plane; and in\nthe darkness leans upon her arm. Or, best of all, because he has\nbelieved, now he sees.",
        "So he looked with a kind of interested indolence at other tracts of his\nnature.",
        "First, there was his intellect, puzzled beyond description, demanding,\nWhy, why, why? Why was it allowed? How was it conceivable that God did\nnot intervene, and that the Father of men could permit His dear world to\nbe so ranged against Him? What did He mean to do? Was this eternal\nsilence never to be broken? It was very well for those that had the\nFaith, but what of the countless millions who were settling down in\ncontented blasphemy? Were these not, too, His children and the sheep of\nHis pasture? What was the Catholic Church made for if not to convert the\nworld, and why then had Almighty God allowed it, on the one side, to\ndwindle to a handful, and, on the other, the world to find its peace\napart from Him?",
        "He considered his emotions, but there was no comfort there, no stimulus.\nOh! yes; he could pray still, by mere cold acts of the will, and his\ntheology told him that God accepted such. He could say ’Adveniat regnum\ntuum. ... Fiat voluntas tua,” five thousand times a day, if God wanted\nthat; but there was no sting or touch, no sense of vibration through the\ncords that his will threw up to the Heavenly Throne. What in the world\nthen did God want him to do? Was it just then to repeat formulas, to lie\nstill, to open despatches, to listen through the telephone, and to\nsuffer?",
        "And then the rest of the world–the madness that had seized upon the\nnations; the amazing stories that had poured in that day of the men in\nParis, who, raving like Bacchantes, had stripped themselves naked in the\nPlace de Concorde, and stabbed themselves to the heart, crying out to\nthunders of applause that life was too enthralling to be endured; of the\nwoman who sang herself mad last night in Spain, and fell laughing and\nfoaming in the concert hall at Seville; of the crucifixion of the\nCatholics that morning in the Pyrenees, and the apostasy of three\nbishops in Germany.... And this ... and this ... and a thousand more\nhorrors were permitted, and God made no sign and spoke no word....",
        "There was a tap, and Percy sprang up as the Cardinal came in.",
        "He looked horribly worn; and his eyes had a kind of sunken brilliance\nthat revealed fever. He made a little motion to Percy to sit down, and\nhimself sat in the deep chair, trembling a little, and gathering his\nbuckled feet beneath his red-buttoned cassock.",
        "“You must forgive me, father,” he said. “I am anxious for the Bishop’s\nsafety. He should be here by now.”",
        "This was the Bishop of Southwark, Percy remembered, who had left England\nearly that morning.",
        "“He is coming straight through, your Eminence?”",
        "“Yes; he should have been here by twenty-three. It is after midnight, is\nit not?”",
        "As he spoke, the bells chimed out the half-hour.",
        "It was nearly quiet now. All day the air had been full of sound; mobs\nhad paraded the suburbs; the gates of the City had been barred, yet that\nwas only an earnest of what was to be expected when the world understood\nitself.",
        "The Cardinal seemed to recover himself after a few minutes’ silence.",
        "“You look tired out, father,” he said kindly.",
        "Percy smiled.",
        "“And your Eminence?” he said.",
        "The old man smiled too.",
        "“Why, yes,” he said. “I shall not last much longer, father. And then it\nwill be you to suffer.”",
        "Percy sat up, suddenly, sick at heart.",
        "“Why, yes,” said the Cardinal. “The Holy Father has arranged it. You are\nto succeed me, you know. It need be no secret.”",
        "Percy drew a long trembling breath.",
        "“Eminence,” he began piteously.",
        "The other lifted a thin old hand.",
        "“I understand all that,” he said softly. “You wish to die, is it not\nso?–and be at peace. There are many who wish that. But we must suffer\nfirst. Et pati et mori. Father Franklin, there must be no faltering.”",
        "There was a long silence.",
        "The news was too stunning to convey anything to the priest but a sense\nof horrible shock. The thought had simply never entered his mind that\nhe, a man under forty, should be considered eligible to succeed this\nwise, patient old prelate. As for the honour–Percy was past that now,\neven had he thought of it. There was but one view before him–of a long\nand intolerable journey, on a road that went uphill, to be traversed\nwith a burden on his shoulders that he could not support.",
        "Yet he recognised its inevitability. The fact was announced to him as\nindisputable; it was to be; there was nothing to be said. But it was as\nif one more gulf had opened, and he stared into it with a dull, sick\nhorror, incapable of expression.",
        "The Cardinal first broke the silence.",
        "“Father Franklin,” he said, “I have seen to-day a picture of\nFelsenburgh. Do you know whom I at first took it for?”",
        "Percy smiled listlessly.",
        "“Yes, father, I took it for you. Now, what do you make of that?”",
        "“I don’t understand, Eminence.”",
        "“Why–-” He broke off, suddenly changing the subject.",
        "“There was a murder in the City to-day,” he said. “A Catholic stabbed a\nblasphemer.”",
        "Percy glanced at him again.",
        "“Oh! yes; he has not attempted to escape,” went on the old man. “He is\nin gaol.”",
        "“And–-”",
        "“He will be executed. The trial will begin to-morrow.... It is sad\nenough. It is the first murder for eight months.”",
        "The irony of the position was evident enough to Percy as he sat\nlistening to the deepening silence outside in the starlit night. Here\nwas this poor city pretending that nothing was the matter, quietly\nadministering its derided justice; and there, outside, were the forces\ngathering that would put an end to all. His enthusiasm seemed dead.\nThere was no thrill from the thought of the splendid disregard of\nmaterial facts of which this was one tiny instance, none of despairing\ncourage or drunken recklessness. He felt like one who watches a fly\nwashing his face on the cylinder of an engine–the huge steel slides\nalong bearing the tiny life towards enormous death–another moment and\nit will be over; and yet the watcher cannot interfere. The supernatural\nthus lay, perfect and alive, but immeasurably tiny; the huge forces were\nin motion, the world was heaving up, and Percy could do nothing but\nstare and frown. Yet, as has been said, there was no shadow on his\nfaith; the fly he knew was greater than the engine from the superiority\nof its order of life; if it were crushed, life would not be the final\nsufferer; so much he knew, but how it was so, he did not know.",
        "As the two sat there, again came a step and a tap; and a servant’s face\nlooked in.",
        "“His Lordship is come, Eminence,” he said.",
        "The Cardinal rose painfully, supporting himself by the table. Then he\npaused, seeming to remember something, and fumbled in his pocket.",
        "“See that, father,” he said, and pushed a small silver disc towards the\npriest. “No; when I am gone.”",
        "Percy closed the door and came back, taking up the little round object.",
        "It was a coin, fresh from the mint. On one side was the familiar wreath\nwith the word “fivepence” in the midst, with its Esperanto equivalent\nbeneath, and on the other the profile of a man, with an inscription.\nPercy turned it to read:",
