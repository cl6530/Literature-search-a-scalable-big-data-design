        "For the time it would seem that Mark Twain had given up authorship for\nbusiness.  The success of the Grant book had filled his head with plans\nfor others of a like nature.  The memoirs of General McClellan and\nGeneral Sheridan were arranged for.  Almost any war-book was considered a\ngood venture.  And there was another plan afoot.  Pope Leo XIII., in his\nold age, had given sanction to the preparation of his memoirs, and it was\nto be published, with his blessing, by Webster & Co., of Hartford.  It\nwas generally believed that such a book would have a tremendous sale, and\nColonel Sellers himself could not have piled the figures higher than did\nhis creator in counting his prospective returns.  Every Catholic in the\nworld must have a copy of the Pope’s book, and in America alone there\nwere millions.  Webster went to Rome to consult with the Pope in person,\nand was received in private audience.  Mark Twain’s publishing firm\nseemed on the top wave of success.",
        "The McClellan and Sheridan books were issued, and, in due time, the Life\nof Pope Leo XIII.–published simultaneously in six languages–issued from\nthe press.  A large advance sale had been guaranteed by the general\ncanvassing agents–a fortunate thing, as it proved.  For, strange as it\nmay seem, the book did not prove a great success.  It is hard to explain\njust why.  Perhaps Catholics felt that there had been so many popes that\nthe life of any particular one was no great matter.  The book paid, but\nnot largely.  The McClellan and Sheridan books, likewise, were only\npartially successful.  Perhaps the public was getting tired of war\nmemoirs.  Webster & Co. undertook books of a general sort–travel,\nfiction, poetry.  Many of them did not pay.  Their business from a march\nof triumph had become a battle.  They undertook a “Library of American\nLiterature,” a work of many volumes, costly to make and even more so to\nsell.  To float this venture they were obliged to borrow large sums.",
        "It seems unfortunate that Mark Twain should have been disturbed by these\ndistracting things during what should have been his literary high-tide.\nAs it was, his business interests and cares absorbed the energy that\nmight otherwise have gone into books.  He was not entirely idle.  He did\nan occasional magazine article or story, and he began a book which he\nworked at from time to time the story of a Connecticut Yankee who\nsuddenly finds himself back in the days of King Arthur’s reign.  Webster\nwas eager to publish another book by his great literary partner, but the\nwork on it went slowly.  Then Webster broke down from two years of\noverwork, and the business management fell into other hands.  Though\nstill recognized as a great publishing-house, those within the firm of\nCharles L. Webster & Co. knew that its prospects were not bright.",
        "Furthermore, Mark Twain had finally invested in another patent, the type-\nsetting machine mentioned in a former chapter, and the demands for cash\nto promote this venture were heavy.  To his sister Pamela, about the end\nof 1887, he wrote: “The type-setter goes on forever at $3,000 a month....\nWe’ll be through with it in three or four months, I reckon\"–a false\nhope, for the three or four months would lengthen into as many years.",
        "But if there were clouds gathering in the business sky, they were not\noften allowed to cast a shadow in Mark Twain’s home.  The beautiful house\nin Hartford was a place of welcome and merriment, of many guests and of\nhappy children.  Especially of happy children: during these years–the\nlatter half of the ’eighties–when Mark Twain’s fortunes were on the\ndecline, his children were at the age to have a good time, and certainly\nthey had it.  The dramatic stage which had been first set up at George\nWarner’s for the Christmas “Prince and Pauper” performance was brought\nover and set up in the Clemens schoolroom, and every Saturday there were\nplays or rehearsals, and every little while there would be a grand\ngeneral performance in the great library downstairs, which would\naccommodate just eighty-four chairs, filled by parents of the performers\nand invited guests.  In notes dictated many years later, Mark Twain said:",
        "“We dined as we could, probably with a neighbor, and by quarter to\n     eight in the evening the hickory fire in the hall was pouring a\n     sheet of flame up the chimney, the house was in a drench of gas-\n     light from the ground floor up, the guests were arriving, and there\n     was a babble of hearty greetings, with not a voice in it that was\n     not old and familiar and affectionate; and when the curtain went up,\n     we looked out from the stage upon none but faces dear to us, none\n     but faces that were lit up with welcome for us.”",
        "He was one of the children himself, you see, and therefore on the stage\nwith the others.  Katy Leary, for thirty years in the family service,\nonce said to the author: “The children were crazy about acting, and we\nall enjoyed it as much as they did, especially Mr. Clemens, who was the\nbest actor of all.  I have never known a happier household than theirs\nwas during those years.”",
        "The plays were not all given by the children.  Mark Twain had kept up his\nGerman study, and a class met regularly in his home to struggle with the\nproblems of der, die, and das.  By and by he wrote a play for the class,\n“Meisterschaft,” a picturesque mixture of German and English, which they\ngave twice, with great success.  It was unlike anything attempted before\nor since.  No one but Mark Twain could have written it.  Later (January,\n1888), in modified form, it was published in the “Century Magazine.”  It\nis his best work of this period.",
        "Many pleasant and amusing things could be recalled from these days if one\nonly had room.  A visit with Robert Louis Stevenson was one of them.\nStevenson was stopping at a small hotel near Washington Square, and he\nand Clemens sat on a bench in the sunshine and talked through at least\none golden afternoon.  What marvelous talk that must have been!  “Huck\nFinn” was one of Stevenson’s favorites, and once he told how he had\ninsisted on reading the book aloud to an artist who was painting his\nportrait.  The painter had protested at first, but presently had fallen a\ncomplete victim to Huck’s story.  Once, in a letter, Stevenson wrote:",
        "“My father, an old man, has been prevailed upon to read ’Roughing It’\n     (his usual amusement being found in theology), and after one evening\n     spent with the book he declared: ’I am frightened.  It cannot be\n     safe for a man at my time of life to laugh so much.’”",
        "Mark Twain had been a “mugwump” during the Blame-Cleveland campaign in\n1880, which means that he had supported the independent Democratic\ncandidate, Grover Cleveland.  He was, therefore, in high favor at the\nWhite House during both Cleveland administrations, and called there\ninformally whenever business took him to Washington.  But on one occasion\n(it was his first visit after the President’s marriage) there was to be a\nparty, and Mrs. Clemens, who could not attend, slipped a little note into\nthe pocket of his evening waistcoat, where he would be sure to find it\nwhen dressing, warning him as to his deportment.  Being presented to\nyoung Mrs. Cleveland, he handed her a card on which he had written, “He\ndidn’t,” and asked her to sign her name below those words.  Mrs.\nCleveland protested that she must know first what it was that he hadn’t\ndone, finally agreeing to sign if he would tell her immediately all about\nit, which he promised to do.  She signed, and he handed her Mrs.\nClemens’s note.  It was very brief.  It said, “Don’t wear your arctics in\nthe White House.”",
        "Mrs. Cleveland summoned a messenger and had the card mailed immediately\nto Mrs. Clemens.",
        "Absent-mindedness was characteristic of Mark Twain.  He lived so much in\nthe world within that to him the material outer world was often vague and\nshadowy.  Once when he was knocking the balls about in the billiard-room,\nGeorge, the colored butler, a favorite and privileged household\ncharacter, brought up a card.  So many canvassers came to sell him one\nthing and another that Clemens promptly assumed this to be one of them.\nGeorge insisted mildly, but firmly, that, though a stranger, the caller\nwas certainly a gentleman, and Clemens grumblingly descended the stairs.\nAs he entered the parlor the caller arose and extended his hand.  Clemens\ntook it rather limply, for he had noticed some water-colors and\nengravings leaning against the furniture as if for exhibition, and he was\ninstantly convinced that the caller was a picture-canvasser.  Inquiries\nby the stranger as to Mrs. Clemens and the children did not change Mark\nTwain’s conclusion.  He was polite, but unresponsive, and gradually\nworked the visitor toward the front door.  His inquiry as to the home of\nCharles Dudley Warner caused him to be shown eagerly in that direction.",
        "Clemens, on his way back to the billiard-room, heard Mrs. Clemens call\nhim–she was ill that day: “Youth!”",
        "“Yes, Livy.”  He went in for a word.",
        "“George brought me Mr. B.’s card.  I hope you were nice to him; the B’s\nwere so nice to us, once, in Europe, while you were gone.”",
        "“The B’s!  Why, Livy!”",
        "“Yes, of course; and I asked him to be sure to call when he came to\nHartford.”",
        "“Well, he’s been here.”",
        "“Oh Youth, have you done anything?”",
        "“Yes, of course I have.  He seemed to have some pictures to sell, so I\nsent him over to Warner’s.  I noticed he didn’t take them with him.  Land\nsakes!  Livy, what can I do?”",
        "“Go right after him–go quick!  Tell him what you have done.”",
        "He went without further delay, bareheaded and in his slippers, as usual.\nWarner and B. were in cheerful conversation.  They had met before.\nClemens entered gaily.",
        "“Oh, yes, I see!  You found him all right.  Charlie, we met Mr. B. and\nhis wife in Europe, and they made things pleasant for us.  I wanted to\ncome over here with him, but I was a good deal occupied just then.  Livy\nisn’t very well, but she seems now a good deal better; so I just followed\nalong to have a good talk, all together.”",
        "He stayed an hour, and whatever bad impression had formed in B.’s mind\nfaded long before the hour ended.  Returning home, Clemens noticed the\npictures still on the parlor floor.",
        "“George,” he said, “what pictures are these that gentleman left?”",
        "“Why, Mr. Clemens, those are our own pictures!  Mrs. Clemens had me set\nthem around to see how they would look in new places.  The gentleman was\nonly looking at them while he waited for you to come down.”",
        "It was in June, 1888, that Yale College conferred upon Mark Twain the\ndegree of Master of Arts.  He was proud of the honor, for it was\nrecognition of a kind that had not come to him before–remarkable\nrecognition, when we remember how as a child he had hated all schools and\nstudy, having ended his class-room days before he was twelve years old.\nHe could not go to New Haven at the time, but later in the year made the\nstudents a delightful address.  In his capacity of Master of Arts, he\nsaid, he had come down to New Haven to institute certain college reforms.",
        "By advice, I turned my earliest attention to the Greek department.  I\ntold the Greek Professor I had concluded to drop the use of the Greek-\nwritten character, because it is so hard to spell with and so impossible\nto read after you get it spelt.  Let us draw the curtain there.  I saw by\nwhat followed that nothing but early neglect saved him from being a very\nprofane man.",
        "He said he had given advice to the mathematical department with about the\nsame result.  The astronomy department he had found in a bad way.  He had\ndecided to transfer the professor to the law department and to put a law-\nstudent in his place.",
        "A boy will be more biddable, more tractable–also cheaper.  It is true he\ncannot be entrusted with important work at first, but he can comb the\nskies for nebula till he gets his hand in.",
        "It was hardly the sort of an address that the holder of a college degree\nis expected to make, but doctors and students alike welcomed it\nhilariously from Mark Twain.",
        "Not many great things happened to Mark Twain during this long period of\nsemi-literary inaction, but many interesting ones.  When Bill Nye, the\nhumorist, and James Whitcomb Riley joined themselves in an entertainment\ncombination, Mark Twain introduced them to their first Boston audience–a\ngreat event to them, and to Boston.  Clemens himself gave a reading now\nand then, but not for money.  Once, when Col. Richard Malcolm Johnston\nand Thomas Nelson Page were to give a reading in Baltimore, Page’s wife\nfell ill, and Colonel Johnston wired to Charles Dudley Warner, asking him\nto come in Page’s stead.  Warner, unable to go, handed the telegram to\nClemens, who promptly answered that he would come.  They read to a packed\nhouse, and when the audience had gone and the returns were counted, an\nequal amount was handed to each of the authors.  Clemens pushed his share\nover to Johnston, saying:",
        "“That’s yours, Colonel.  I’m not reading for money these days.”",
        "Colonel Johnston, to whom the sum was important, tried to thank him, but\nClemens only said:",
        "“Never mind, Colonel; it only gives me pleasure to do you that little\nfavor.  You can pass it along some day.”",
        "As a matter of fact, Mark Twain himself was beginning to be hard pressed\nfor funds at this time, but was strong in the faith that he would\npresently be a multi-millionaire.  The typesetting machine was still\ncosting a vast sum, but each week its inventor promised that a few more\nweeks or months would see it finished, and then a tide of wealth would\ncome rolling in.  Mark Twain felt that a man with ship-loads of money\nalmost in port could not properly entertain the public for pay.  He read\nfor institutions, schools, benefits, and the like, without charge.",
