        " How and about Little Margery and her Brother.",
        "Care and Discontent shortened the Days of Little Margery’sFather.–He was forced from his Family, and seized with a violent\nFever in a Place where Dr. James’s Powder was not to be had,\nand where he died miserably. Margery’s poor Mother survived the\nLoss of her Husband but a few Days, and died of a broken Heart,\nleaving Margery and her little Brother to the wide World; but,\npoor Woman, it would have melted your Heart to have seen how\nfrequently she heaved up her Head, while she lay speechless, to survey\nwith languishing Looks her little Orphans, as much as to say, Do\nTommy, do Margery, come with me. They cried, poor Things, and she\nsighed away her Soul; and I hope is happy.",
        "It would both have excited your Pity, and have done your Heart good,\nto have seen how fond these two little ones were of each other, and\nhow, Hand in Hand, they trotted about. Pray see them.",
        "They were both very ragged, and Tommy had two Shoes, but\nMargery had but one. They had nothing, poor Things, to support\nthem (not being in their own Parish) but what they picked from the\nHedges, or got from the poor People, and they lay every Night in a\nBarn. Their Relations took no Notice of them; no, they were rich, and\nashamed to own such a poor little ragged Girl as Margery, and\nsuch a dirty little curl-pated Boy as Tommy. Our Relations and\nFriends seldom take Notice of us when we are poor; but as we grow rich\nthey grow fond. And this will always be the Case, while People love\nMoney better than Virtue, or better than they do GOD Almighty. But\nsuch wicked Folks, who love nothing but Money, and are proud and\ndespise the Poor, never come to any good in the End, as we shall see\nby and by.",
