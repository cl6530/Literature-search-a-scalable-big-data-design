        "The Gerusalemme Liberata, or Jerusalem Delivered, was written by Torquato\nTasso, who was born at Sorrento, March 11, 1544. He was educated at\nNaples, Urbino, Rome, Venice, Padua, and Bologna. In 1572 he attached\nhimself to the court of Ferrara, which he had visited in 1565 in the suite\nof the Cardinal d’Este, and by whose duke he had been treated with great\nconsideration. Here his pastoral drama “Aminta” was written and performed,\nand here he began to write his epic. The duke, angry because of Tasso’s\naffection for his sister Eleanora, and fearful lest the poet should\ndedicate his poem to the Medicis, whom he visited in 1575, and into whose\nservice he was asked to enter, kept him under strict surveillance, and\npretended to regard him as insane. Feigning sympathy and a desire to\nrestore his mind, he had the unfortunate poet confined in a mad-house.\nTasso escaped several times, but each time returned in the hope of a\nreconciliation with the duke. During his confinement his poem was\npublished without his permission: first in 1580, a very imperfect version;\nin 1581, a genuine one. This at once brought him great fame; but while its\npublishers made a fortune, Tasso received nothing. Neither did the duke\nrelent, although powerful influences were brought to bear on him. Tasso\nwas not released until 1586, and then, broken in health, he passed the\nrest of his life in Rome and Naples, living on charity, though treated\nwith great honor. He died in Rome, April 25, 1595, just before he was to\nhave been crowned at the capitol.",
        "The Jerusalem Delivered has for its subject the first Crusade, and the\nevents recorded in its twenty cantos comprise the happenings in the camp\nof the Crusaders during forty days of the campaign of 1099. Its metre is\nthe octava rima, the eight lined rhymed stanza.",
        "Tasso was not so successful in the delineation of character and in the\ndescription of actions as in the interpretation of feeling, being by\nnature a lyric rather than an epic poet. But his happy choice of\nsubject,–for the Crusades were still fresh in the memory of the people,\nand chivalry was a thing of the present–his zeal for the Christian cause,\nhis impassioned delineations of love, and his exquisitely poetical\ntreatment of his whole theme, rendered his epic irresistible.",
