        "I sat down on the very crest of the pass and took stock of my position.",
        "Behind me was the road climbing through a long cleft in the\nhills, which was the upper glen of some notable river.  In front was\na flat space of maybe a mile, all pitted with bog-holes and rough\nwith tussocks, and then beyond it the road fell steeply down another\nglen to a plain whose blue dimness melted into the distance.  To left\nand right were round-shouldered green hills as smooth as pancakes,\nbut to the south–that is, the left hand–there was a glimpse of\nhigh heathery mountains, which I remembered from the map as the\nbig knot of hill which I had chosen for my sanctuary.  I was on the\ncentral boss of a huge upland country, and could see everything\nmoving for miles.  In the meadows below the road half a mile back\na cottage smoked, but it was the only sign of human life.  Otherwise\nthere was only the calling of plovers and the tinkling of little streams.",
        "It was now about seven o’clock, and as I waited I heard once\nagain that ominous beat in the air.  Then I realized that my vantage-\nground might be in reality a trap.  There was no cover for a tomtit\nin those bald green places.",
        "I sat quite still and hopeless while the beat grew louder.  Then I\nsaw an aeroplane coming up from the east.  It was flying high, but\nas I looked it dropped several hundred feet and began to circle\nround the knot of hill in narrowing circles, just as a hawk wheels\nbefore it pounces.  Now it was flying very low, and now the observer\non board caught sight of me.  I could see one of the two occupants\nexamining me through glasses.",
        "Suddenly it began to rise in swift whorls, and the next I knew\nit was speeding eastward again till it became a speck in the\nblue morning.",
        "That made me do some savage thinking.  My enemies had located\nme, and the next thing would be a cordon round me.  I didn’t know\nwhat force they could command, but I was certain it would be\nsufficient.  The aeroplane had seen my bicycle, and would conclude\nthat I would try to escape by the road.  In that case there might be a\nchance on the moors to the right or left.  I wheeled the machine a\nhundred yards from the highway, and plunged it into a moss-hole,\nwhere it sank among pond-weed and water-buttercups.  Then I\nclimbed to a knoll which gave me a view of the two valleys.\nNothing was stirring on the long white ribbon that threaded them.",
        "I have said there was not cover in the whole place to hide a rat.\nAs the day advanced it was flooded with soft fresh light till it had\nthe fragrant sunniness of the South African veld.  At other times I\nwould have liked the place, but now it seemed to suffocate me.  The\nfree moorlands were prison walls, and the keen hill air was the\nbreath of a dungeon.",
        "I tossed a coin–heads right, tails left–and it fell heads, so I\nturned to the north.  In a little I came to the brow of the ridge\nwhich was the containing wall of the pass.  I saw the highroad for\nmaybe ten miles, and far down it something that was moving, and\nthat I took to be a motor-car.  Beyond the ridge I looked on a\nrolling green moor, which fell away into wooded glens.",
        "Now my life on the veld has given me the eyes of a kite, and I\ncan see things for which most men need a telescope ...  Away\ndown the slope, a couple of miles away, several men were advancing.\nlike a row of beaters at a shoot ...",
        "I dropped out of sight behind the sky-line.  That way was shut to\nme, and I must try the bigger hills to the south beyond the highway.\nThe car I had noticed was getting nearer, but it was still a long way\noff with some very steep gradients before it.  I ran hard, crouching\nlow except in the hollows, and as I ran I kept scanning the brow of\nthe hill before me.  Was it imagination, or did I see figures–one,\ntwo, perhaps more–moving in a glen beyond the stream?",
        "If you are hemmed in on all sides in a patch of land there is only\none chance of escape.  You must stay in the patch, and let your\nenemies search it and not find you.  That was good sense, but how\non earth was I to escape notice in that table-cloth of a place?  I\nwould have buried myself to the neck in mud or lain below water\nor climbed the tallest tree.  But there was not a stick of wood, the\nbog-holes were little puddles, the stream was a slender trickle.  There\nwas nothing but short heather, and bare hill bent, and the white highway.",
        "Then in a tiny bight of road, beside a heap of stones, I found\nthe roadman.",
        "He had just arrived, and was wearily flinging down his hammer.\nHe looked at me with a fishy eye and yawned.",
        "’Confoond the day I ever left the herdin’!’ he said, as if to the\nworld at large.  ’There I was my ain maister.  Now I’m a slave to the\nGoavernment, tethered to the roadside, wi’ sair een, and a back like\na suckle.’",
        "He took up the hammer, struck a stone, dropped the implement\nwith an oath, and put both hands to his ears.  ’Mercy on me!  My\nheid’s burstin’!’ he cried.",
        "He was a wild figure, about my own size but much bent, with a\nweek’s beard on his chin, and a pair of big horn spectacles.",
        "’I canna dae’t,’ he cried again.  ’The Surveyor maun just report\nme.  I’m for my bed.’",
        "I asked him what was the trouble, though indeed that was\nclear enough.",
        "’The trouble is that I’m no sober.  Last nicht my dochter Merran\nwas waddit, and they danced till fower in the byre.  Me and some\nither chiels sat down to the drinkin’, and here I am.  Peety that I\never lookit on the wine when it was red!’",
        "I agreed with him about bed.\n’It’s easy speakin’,’ he moaned.  ’But I got a postcard yestreen\nsayin’ that the new Road Surveyor would be round the day.  He’ll\ncome and he’ll no find me, or else he’ll find me fou, and either way\nI’m a done man.  I’ll awa’ back to my bed and say I’m no weel, but\nI doot that’ll no help me, for they ken my kind o’ no-weel-ness.’",
        "Then I had an inspiration.  ’Does the new Surveyor know you?’\nI asked.",
        "’No him.  He’s just been a week at the job.  He rins about in a wee\nmotor-cawr, and wad speir the inside oot o’ a whelk.’",
        "’Where’s your house?’ I asked, and was directed by a wavering\nfinger to the cottage by the stream.",
        "’Well, back to your bed,’ I said, ’and sleep in peace.  I’ll take on\nyour job for a bit and see the Surveyor.’",
        "He stared at me blankly; then, as the notion dawned on his\nfuddled brain, his face broke into the vacant drunkard’s smile.",
        "’You’re the billy,’ he cried.  ’It’ll be easy eneuch managed.  I’ve\nfinished that bing o’ stanes, so you needna chap ony mair this\nforenoon.  Just take the barry, and wheel eneuch metal frae yon\nquarry doon the road to mak anither bing the morn.  My name’s\nAlexander Turnbull, and I’ve been seeven year at the trade, and\ntwenty afore that herdin’ on Leithen Water.  My freens ca’ me Ecky,\nand whiles Specky, for I wear glesses, being waik i’ the sicht.  Just\nyou speak the Surveyor fair, and ca’ him Sir, and he’ll be fell\npleased.  I’ll be back or mid-day.’",
        "I borrowed his spectacles and filthy old hat; stripped off coat,\nwaistcoat, and collar, and gave him them to carry home; borrowed,\ntoo, the foul stump of a clay pipe as an extra property.  He indicated\nmy simple tasks, and without more ado set off at an amble bedwards.\nBed may have been his chief object, but I think there was\nalso something left in the foot of a bottle.  I prayed that he might be\nsafe under cover before my friends arrived on the scene.",
        "Then I set to work to dress for the part.  I opened the collar of\nmy shirt–it was a vulgar blue-and-white check such as ploughmen\nwear–and revealed a neck as brown as any tinker’s.  I rolled up my\nsleeves, and there was a forearm which might have been a blacksmith’s,\nsunburnt and rough with old scars.  I got my boots and trouser-legs\nall white from the dust of the road, and hitched up my trousers, \ntying them with string below the knee.  Then I set to work on my face.\nWith a handful of dust I made a water-mark round my neck, the place\nwhere Mr Turnbull’s Sunday ablutions might be expected to stop.\nI rubbed a good deal of dirt also into the sunburn of my cheeks.  \nA roadman’s eyes would no doubt be a little inflamed, so I contrived\nto get some dust in both of mine, and by dint of vigorous rubbing\nproduced a bleary effect.",
        "The sandwiches Sir Harry had given me had gone off with my\ncoat, but the roadman’s lunch, tied up in a red handkerchief, was at\nmy disposal.  I ate with great relish several of the thick slabs of\nscone and cheese and drank a little of the cold tea.  In the handkerchief\nwas a local paper tied with string and addressed to Mr Turnbull–\nobviously meant to solace his mid-day leisure.  I did up the\nbundle again, and put the paper conspicuously beside it.",
        "My boots did not satisfy me, but by dint of kicking among the\nstones I reduced them to the granite-like surface which marks a\nroadman’s foot-gear.  Then I bit and scraped my finger-nails till the\nedges were all cracked and uneven.  The men I was matched against\nwould miss no detail.  I broke one of the bootlaces and retied it in a\nclumsy knot, and loosed the other so that my thick grey socks\nbulged over the uppers.  Still no sign of anything on the road.  The\nmotor I had observed half an hour ago must have gone home.",
        "My toilet complete, I took up the barrow and began my journeys\nto and from the quarry a hundred yards off.",
        "I remember an old scout in Rhodesia, who had done many queer\nthings in his day, once telling me that the secret of playing a part\nwas to think yourself into it.  You could never keep it up, he said,\nunless you could manage to convince yourself that you were it.  So I\nshut off all other thoughts and switched them on to the road-\nmending.  I thought of the little white cottage as my home, I\nrecalled the years I had spent herding on Leithen Water, I made my\nmind dwell lovingly on sleep in a box-bed and a bottle of cheap\nwhisky.  Still nothing appeared on that long white road.",
        "Now and then a sheep wandered off the heather to stare at me.  A\nheron flopped down to a pool in the stream and started to fish,\ntaking no more notice of me than if I had been a milestone.  On I\nwent, trundling my loads of stone, with the heavy step of the\nprofessional.  Soon I grew warm, and the dust on my face changed\ninto solid and abiding grit.  I was already counting the hours till\nevening should put a limit to Mr Turnbull’s monotonous toil.\nSuddenly a crisp voice spoke from the road, and looking up I\nsaw a little Ford two-seater, and a round-faced young man in a\nbowler hat.",
        "’Are you Alexander Turnbull?’ he asked.  ’I am the new County\nRoad Surveyor.  You live at Blackhopefoot, and have charge of the\nsection from Laidlawbyres to the Riggs?  Good!  A fair bit of road,\nTurnbull, and not badly engineered.  A little soft about a mile off,\nand the edges want cleaning.  See you look after that.  Good morning.\nYou’ll know me the next time you see me.’",
        "Clearly my get-up was good enough for the dreaded Surveyor.  I\nwent on with my work, and as the morning grew towards noon I\nwas cheered by a little traffic.  A baker’s van breasted the hill, and\nsold me a bag of ginger biscuits which I stowed in my trouser-\npockets against emergencies.  Then a herd passed with sheep, and\ndisturbed me somewhat by asking loudly, ’What had become o’ Specky?’",
        "’In bed wi’ the colic,’ I replied, and the herd passed on ...\njust about mid-day a big car stole down the hill, glided past and\ndrew up a hundred yards beyond.  Its three occupants descended as\nif to stretch their legs, and sauntered towards me.",
        "Two of the men I had seen before from the window of the\nGalloway inn–one lean, sharp, and dark, the other comfortable\nand smiling.  The third had the look of a countryman–a vet,\nperhaps, or a small farmer.  He was dressed in ill-cut knickerbockers,\nand the eye in his head was as bright and wary as a hen’s.",
        "’Morning,’ said the last.  ’That’s a fine easy job o’ yours.’",
        "I had not looked up on their approach, and now, when accosted,\nI slowly and painfully straightened my back, after the manner of\nroadmen; spat vigorously, after the manner of the low Scot; and\nregarded them steadily before replying.  I confronted three pairs of\neyes that missed nothing.",
        "’There’s waur jobs and there’s better,’ I said sententiously.  ’I wad\nrather hae yours, sittin’ a’ day on your hinderlands on thae cushions.\nIt’s you and your muckle cawrs that wreck my roads!  If we a’ had\noor richts, ye sud be made to mend what ye break.’",
        "The bright-eyed man was looking at the newspaper lying beside\nTurnbull’s bundle.",
        "’I see you get your papers in good time,’ he said.",
        "I glanced at it casually.  ’Aye, in gude time.  Seein’ that that paper\ncam’ out last Setterday I’m just Sax days late.’",
        "He picked it up, glanced at the superscription, and laid it down\nagain.  One of the others had been looking at my boots, and a word\nin German called the speaker’s attention to them.",
        "’You’ve a fine taste in boots,’ he said.  ’These were never made\nby a country shoemaker.’",
        "’They were not,’ I said readily.  ’They were made in London.  I\ngot them frae the gentleman that was here last year for the shootin’.\nWhat was his name now?’  And I scratched a forgetful head.\nAgain the sleek one spoke in German.  ’Let us get on,’ he said.\n’This fellow is all right.’",
        "They asked one last question.",
        "’Did you see anyone pass early this morning?  He might be on a\nbicycle or he might be on foot.’",
        "I very nearly fell into the trap and told a story of a bicyclist\nhurrying past in the grey dawn.  But I had the sense to see my\ndanger.  I pretended to consider very deeply.",
        "’I wasna up very early,’ I said.  ’Ye see, my dochter was merrit\nlast nicht, and we keepit it up late.  I opened the house door about\nseeven and there was naebody on the road then.  Since I cam’ up\nhere there has just been the baker and the Ruchill herd, besides you\ngentlemen.’",
        "One of them gave me a cigar, which I smelt gingerly and stuck\nin Turnbull’s bundle.  They got into their car and were out of sight\nin three minutes.",
        "My heart leaped with an enormous relief, but I went on wheeling\nmy stones.  It was as well, for ten minutes later the car returned, one\nof the occupants waving a hand to me.  Those gentry left nothing\nto chance.",
        "I finished Turnbull’s bread and cheese, and pretty soon I had\nfinished the stones.  The next step was what puzzled me.  I could not\nkeep up this roadmaking business for long.  A merciful Providence\nhad kept Mr Turnbull indoors, but if he appeared on the scene\nthere would be trouble.  I had a notion that the cordon was still\ntight round the glen, and that if I walked in any direction I should\nmeet with questioners.  But get out I must.  No man’s nerve could\nstand more than a day of being spied on.",
        "I stayed at my post till five o’clock.  By that time I had resolved\nto go down to Turnbull’s cottage at nightfall and take my chance\nof getting over the hills in the darkness.  But suddenly a new car\ncame up the road, and slowed down a yard or two from me.  A\nfresh wind had risen, and the occupant wanted to light a cigarette.\nIt was a touring car, with the tonneau full of an assortment of\nbaggage.  One man sat in it, and by an amazing chance I knew him.\nHis name was Marmaduke jopley, and he was an offence to creation.\nHe was a sort of blood stockbroker, who did his business by\ntoadying eldest sons and rich young peers and foolish old ladies.\n’Marmie’ was a familiar figure, I understood, at balls and polo-\nweeks and country houses.  He was an adroit scandal-monger, and\nwould crawl a mile on his belly to anything that had a title or a\nmillion.  I had a business introduction to his firm when I came to\nLondon, and he was good enough to ask me to dinner at his club.\nThere he showed off at a great rate, and pattered about his duchesses\ntill the snobbery of the creature turned me sick.  I asked a man\nafterwards why nobody kicked him, and was told that Englishmen\nreverenced the weaker sex.",
        "Anyhow there he was now, nattily dressed, in a fine new car,\nobviously on his way to visit some of his smart friends.  A sudden\ndaftness took me, and in a second I had jumped into the tonneau\nand had him by the shoulder.",
        "’Hullo, jopley,’ I sang out.  ’Well met, my lad!’  He got a horrid\nfright.  His chin dropped as he stared at me.  ’Who the devil are\nYOU?’ he gasped.",
        "’My name’s Hannay,’ I said.  ’From Rhodesia, you remember.’",
        "’Good God, the murderer!’ he choked.",
        "’Just so.  And there’ll be a second murder, my dear, if you don’t\ndo as I tell you.  Give me that coat of yours.  That cap, too.’",
        "He did as bid, for he was blind with terror.  Over my dirty\ntrousers and vulgar shirt I put on his smart driving-coat, which\nbuttoned high at the top and thereby hid the deficiencies of my\ncollar.  I stuck the cap on my head, and added his gloves to my get-\nup.  The dusty roadman in a minute was transformed into one of\nthe neatest motorists in Scotland.  On Mr jopley’s head I clapped\nTurnbull’s unspeakable hat, and told him to keep it there.",
        "Then with some difficulty I turned the car.  My plan was to go\nback the road he had come, for the watchers, having seen it before,\nwould probably let it pass unremarked, and Marmie’s figure was in\nno way like mine.",
        "’Now, my child,’ I said, ’sit quite still and be a good boy.  I mean\nyou no harm.  I’m only borrowing your car for an hour or two.  But\nif you play me any tricks, and above all if you open your mouth, as\nsure as there’s a God above me I’ll wring your neck.  SAVEZ?’",
        "I enjoyed that evening’s ride.  We ran eight miles down the\nvalley, through a village or two, and I could not help noticing\nseveral strange-looking folk lounging by the roadside.  These were\nthe watchers who would have had much to say to me if I had come\nin other garb or company.  As it was, they looked incuriously on.\nOne touched his cap in salute, and I responded graciously.",
        "As the dark fell I turned up a side glen which, as I remember\nfrom the map, led into an unfrequented corner of the hills.  Soon\nthe villages were left behind, then the farms, and then even the\nwayside cottage.  Presently we came to a lonely moor where the\nnight was blackening the sunset gleam in the bog pools.  Here we\nstopped, and I obligingly reversed the car and restored to Mr\njopley his belongings.",
        "’A thousand thanks,’ I said.  ’There’s more use in you than I\nthought.  Now be off and find the police.’",
        "As I sat on the hillside, watching the tail-light dwindle, I reflected\non the various kinds of crime I had now sampled.  Contrary to\ngeneral belief, I was not a murderer, but I had become an unholy\nliar, a shameless impostor, and a highwayman with a marked taste\nfor expensive motor-cars.",
