        "The drive from Winchfield (7 miles) is chiefly across beautiful heathery\ncommons; from Wokingham the road is more enclosed with hedges. Eversley\nChurch and rectory stand almost alone, save for a farmhouse and barns,\nbeing nearly a mile from the other portions of the village. The church\nis very picturesquely situated on sloping ground, an avenue of yews\nleading from the lych gate to the porch. Inside, the building has\nsuffered a good deal from restoration, but the pulpit from which\nKingsley preached his stirring sermons remains unaltered. The rectory is\na very old building which has been modernised on the side fronting on\nthe road. On the lawn stands the group of glorious Scotch firs which\nKingsley was never tired of watching. Their boughs sweep downwards and\nalmost touch the grass, and their great red trunks are a strong contrast\nto the dense green of the surrounding foliage.",
        "In one of the sitting-rooms is a set of drawers in which Kingsley kept a\ncollection of fossils. His grave is on the side of the church yard\nnearest the overshadowing branches of the Scotch firs. The Runic cross\nof white marble is a beautiful one. The head is ornamented with a spray\nof passion flower and bears upon it the words “God is Love.” On the base\nare the words “Amavimus, amamus, amabimus.”",
        "The neighbouring district of Bramshill has still the little thatched\ncottage where Kingsley used to conduct a little simple service on Sunday\nafternoons. The whole of the country surrounding Bramshill Park is\nclosely covered with self-sown firs, and the commons interspersed among\nthe forest lands are covered with heather and gorse. This was the\ncountry Kingsley loved, whether he was riding over it with the local\npack of foxhounds or on a visit to one of his parishioners.",
