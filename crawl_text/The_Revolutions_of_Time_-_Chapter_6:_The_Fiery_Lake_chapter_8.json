        "When I woke I was no longer in that room but in another, a small homely\nroom where I was laid on a bed, the room being located, as I found out\nlater, not too far from the Hall of Meeting. Though the depth of the\nfortress prevented me from knowing the time, it felt to be early\nafternoon by that strange internal clock that so seldom errs. It was\ncorrect, as usual. There was a quaint fireplace on the far wall of the\nroom with a small, unadorned and unpretentious mantle, decorated like\nthe rest of the fortress in a practical and experienced way, finding\njust the right flavor between the ornate, the practical, and the quaint,\nand avoiding all the while the clutter brought by superfluous material\npossessions. A table in the center of the room was furnished with a\nsteaming meal, beside which sat my new friend Bernibus, smiling on me\nwith a benevolent and almost paternal affection.",
        "“Good morning, Jehu,” he said, “Or should I say afternoon, for the\nmorning has quite passed by already.”",
        "“Yes, and it has left in me a great appetite, my good man.”",
        "“As is shown clearly in your eyes,” he jested, “Come and eat.”",
        "Needing no further urging, I leapt from my bed, sat down across from him\nat the table, and began partaking greedily of the hearty breakfast of\nhash browns and pancakes, which were pleasing to my mouth and stomach,\nfor the tastes in food are controlled more by the condition of the body\nthan by the time of day. When I had satisfied my needs, we reclined in\nour chairs and began conversing:",
        "“Tell me,” I said, “Did my untimely slumber yester eve cause any\nirritated prides?”",
        "“Quite to the contrary, the council was well humored and followed your\nlead to their bed chambers.”",
        "“I am relieved to hear it, for I was anxious of appearing lax in ardor\nor animation.”",
        "“Not so, my friend, you are quite exonerated from doubtful thoughts.\nThere is a session planned for this evening though, so may yet feel\nyourself put on trial.”",
        "“Unfortunate,” said I, “But surely they can mean no harm, am I not the\nkinsman redeemer, after all?”",
        "“Yes, you are,” Bernibus said with a look of subdued apprehension, “We\nhave an end in view, though the means are as yet not wholly decided. It\nis a complicated situation.”",
        "I smiled softly, “So is always the case.”",
        "“In truth it is: time reveals all things yet do all things reveal time?”",
        "“What do you mean?” I asked him.",
        "“Our situation is complicated by differing views of time, and I was\nwondering aloud if history and the present reality disclose the truth\nabout time in the same way that time reveals the truth of the present.\nIf our way were more illuminated, the journey would be easier.”",
        "“Perhaps that is why men look to the well lit paths of history, or to\nthe dim conjectures of the future rather than the dark, yet detailed\nways of present.”",
        "“Perhaps,” he said, “But the present is so fleeting that it holds little\nintrigue”",
        "“Even so, it is the stage, not still waiting behind the curtain, nor\nalready performed.”",
        "“Yet the past controls by influences and prejudices, justified or not,\nand it will doubtless be the view of the council that the past must be\nredone, that the problems be addressed at the source,” Bernibus replied.",
        "“I am still in the dark about all your inferences,” I said.",
        "“My apologies, I forget myself. But let us not dwell on subjects which\nmay become quite exhausted in the near future, for better or worse,” he\ntold me.",
        "“Fair enough,” I returned, acceding to the subject change, and jumping\non the opportunity to steer it in a different direction, “I know little\nof you, Bernibus, so tell me all.”",
        "“There isn’t much to tell,” he coyly responded.",
        "“Nonsense, Bernibus, tell me or I shall get very angry,” I jested,\nimitating some mythological god’s wrath.",
        "He smiled discreetly and yielded to my request, “Very well, I will tell\nyou. I was born in the year 490 D.V. (that is, Durante Vita), to a poor\ncouple from the northernmost pier of Daem, the Gog.”",
        "“Wait a moment, Bernibus,” I interrupted, “I didn’t mean in that\nfashion, for when I say I know little of you, it is because I literally\nknow little of ’you’, not the circumstances that make up your past. I\nguess it goes back to the interpretation of the past and its powers, and\nsince we can’t seem to escape discussing it, lets embrace it willingly.\nYou seem to believe that the events of your life have shaped you in such\na profound way that their mere description is sufficient to explain your\npersonality; I will grant that their influence has effected you subtly,\nbut history is not the scapegoat of the present. The circumstances do\nmore to define the character of an individual than to shape it, for even\nsiblings with the exact same experiences can be greatly different in\npersonality and achievements. But what I mean is this: your past has\ninfluenced your present, yet it is gone and your present remains, show\nme Bernibus, not his previous forms.”",
        "You, who are now reading this, may think this statement of mine to\nBernibus to be hypocritical, in light of the very purpose and intent of\nthese memoirs. You may be thinking that I am relating this whole\nhappening in order to justify my actions and decisions. But that is not\nthe case, for I understand that you have no power over me, I have long\nbeen dead in your present and your sentiments mean naught to me. In\nfact, I wish to tell of the circumstances I found myself in as much as\nof myself, so that you may have a retrospective clarity in visions of\nthe future. You will understand that statement later on, but for now let\nme say that I wished to know the essence, the person, the consciousness\nof Bernibus, whereas I wish to impart to you my story, though ere its\nend you may come also to know me. I have no ambitions of material\nimmortality.",
        "Bernibus understood my meaning, and though he disagreed with its\ntheoretical imputations, he humored me and did as I suggested. He pulled\nback his brow in a reflective demeanor, brought his eyes to mine and\nbegan:",
        "“You desire me to tell you about myself without literally telling you of\nmyself. I suppose you mean that we discourse on some variety of\nsubjects, so that you can see who I am discreetly,” he said.",
        "“Exactly,” I replied, “You say it better than I.”",
        "“Perhaps it is for the best, as you will draw your own conclusions\nrather than be given mine, and instead of my telling you what I would\nlike to think I am, you would see what I am in truth. Strange, isn’t it,\nthat though we think we know ourselves, we very much do not, and it is\nonly the unbiased observer who sees us as we are. You know, I was once\nthinking of writing my memoirs, and I would have, except that I was\nafraid that if I read them afterward I would be forced to see myself as\nI am and be horrified at the truth.”",
        "“Damn the truth,” I said.",
        "“You’re starting to sound like a philosopher,” he laughed.",
        "“And you a psychologist,” I rejoined.",
        "“And where would that place us on the scale of artificial intelligence,\"\nBernibus jested.",
        "“Following the footsteps of Jeroboam,” I returned.",
        "“Hmm?",
        "“Oh, nothing. Tell me,” I asked more solemnly, “What position does\nWagner hold among the Canitaurs?”",
        "“He is the Khedive Kibitzer, our ruler in that he leads the council.”",
        "“And you?”",
        "“I am his brother-in-law, a relationship that our culture places great\nimportance on, especially as he has no blood brothers. I become, in\neffect, his partner, though he doesn’t accept me emotionally as one,\nonly in etiquette.”",
        "“Why is that?” I inquired.",
        "“Because, I am of weak heritage. His sister loved me, and I her, but to\nhim there is no such thing as love, only business, the destruction of\nthe Zards at any cost. No price is too high,” he told me with almost a\nvengeful scowl on his usually pleasant features, it soon passed, though,\nand left no trace when it had.",
        "“You sound bitter, Bernibus.”",
        "“My feelings betray me, yet I am not bitter, only disillusioned.”",
        "“You sympathize with the Zards, then?”",
        "“Not at all, I do sympathize, however, with peaceful solutions,” he\nsaid.",
        "“Which is why Wagner disapproves of you, no doubt.”",
        "“Yes, mainly, but don’t misunderstand me. I am not a closet Futurist,\nnor am I a strict pacifist, I just can’t help feeling that there is\nanother way. But I understand the selection of ideologies, how the\nstronger breaks the weaker to submission, and while one flourishes, the\nother diminishes, and I understand focus points, but I cannot justify\ntheir marriage.”",
        "“What you mean by focus points?” I asked.",
        "“They are the culmination of conflict, where two sides meet and the\nbattle takes place, not meaning necessarily an important or strategic\nmilitary, civil, or commercial place, but one on which the fighting\noccurs, the result ending in the defeat or victory of the whole\ncampaign. The focus point of the Zards and the Canitaurs exists both on\nthe philosophical and martial levels. On the philosophical level, it is\nthe question as to what is the proper solution for remedying our current\ncatastrophic situation. On one side the Pastites wish to correct the\nroot of the problem by stopping its realization in the past, the\nFuturists, however, would venture into the future and brings its\nstabilization and completion back. On the military level, our forces\ncollide in the forests around Lake Umquam Renatusum, the northern\nmountains belonging to us and the southern plains to them. The lake\nitself is of little importance, yet whoever conquers it will conquer\nall.”",
        "“Interesting,” I said, “But I do not understand how you seem to imply\nthat I am your ancestor, while Onan seemed to mean the opposite, that\nyou are my ancestors.”",
        "“It is strange and complex, and we understand very little of it,\nourselves. The time for the council has come though, for our talk has\ndwindled away the afternoon. Perhaps some of your questions will there\nbe answered. But come, let us go.”",
        "“Very well,” I said, “Take me to your leaders.”",
        "From that room, the one I had awoken in, it wasn’t very far to the\ncouncil room. Exiting it, we turned down a short, closed hallway that\nopened into the concealed area behind the podium that I spoke of\nearlier. On the sofa where I had fallen asleep was seated Wagner and on\na circle of smaller chairs around the edges of the area were seated\nabout ten stately looking Canitaurs, clean and well dressed, according\nto their customs. They greeted me amorously, with a mixture of\neagerness, excitement, and hope painted on their purloined countenances,\ntaken from the sleepless spirits of several departed generations of war-\nhardened veterans.",
        "Standing as we entered, they greeted me cordially, and, once the formal\ngreeting of a short bow and a blessing was finished, we all sat down,\nthey in their previous seats, I next to Wagner, and Bernibus in a small\nchair in the corner, away from the circle of the delegates. He, that is,\nWagner, then opened our dialog:",
        "“Welcome to the council, Jehu,” he said.",
        "“I was under the impression that the council was much larger,” I replied\ncandidly.",
        "“It is, but this is the leadership; we felt that the clamors of a full\nlegislature would be overwhelming to you at first. I know it still\noverwhelms me sometimes,” he laughed, and the others with him. That\nexplanation sufficed at the time, but I later found that Wagner had\ntaken control of the council himself, and that it had no real power: it\nnever met for more than ceremonial matters, the Khedive Kibitzer,\nWagner, controlling the rest. But I get ahead of myself.",
        "One of the others then interjected, “Our purpose now, Jehu, is not so\nmuch to make decisions as to inform you of the decisions we have already\nmade, not that we mean to exclude you from our counsels, but we’ve been\npreparing for this moment, your arrival, for many years, since it was\nforetold long ago.”",
        "“Decisions with what end?” I asked of them.",
        "“The reestablishing of an efficient and healthy climate, both naturally\nand philosophically, one in which tradition, history, and experience\nreign supreme,” Wagner said in such a way that I couldn’t help but think\nthat it had served as an idiom of his for many years.",
        "“A termination of the Zardovian conflict, then?”",
        "“Essentially, but not wholly, as there are other, more complicated ends\nin view, less integrated with the format of a completely ideological\nconflict.”",
        "“Meaning?”",
        "“Meaning that we wish to return to our original forms,” Wagner said.",
        "“Those being, I assume, the same as my own.”",
        "“Yes, you see after the Great War, the atmosphere was so filled with\nradioactive materials that all life was destroyed, except for that on\nDaem, which was protected because of our distant and isolated location,\nand the presence of a group of insects that neutralize radiation. They\nwere overwhelmed in the first few decades, for though they were able to\nreduce the amount to make it habitable, we degenerated into what we are\nnow, Zards and Canitaurs, based on our habitats, we being mountainous,\nforest dwelling folk, and they plains people. At first our ancestors\ngrew to immense proportions, as did the vegetation on Daem, but we\nslowly returned to normal size as the radioactive material was consumed.\nI am surprised that Onan did not tell you about it all,” he said,\nlooking at me with a slight tinge of confusion creeping into his wayward\neyes, formerly filled only with hope and excitement.",
        "“I wish he would have,” I responded, “But he said that it was against\nthe rules.”",
        "“Ah, yes, I forgot about the rules there for a moment,” he laughed, his\ncountenance returning to its former gleeful appearance.",
        "“A foolish law, no doubt, and from whom?” I said, availing of the\napparent intra-personal deja vu, that is, the converging of the presents\nof our two minds into one idea, between Wagner and myself to cultivate a\nbit of sympathy in my difficult situation. But there would be no\nharvest, for Wagner checked his mirth and said:",
        "“It was necessary, and the Council of the Gods did well to govern\nthemselves more strictly.”",
        "“How so?”",
        "“Well, during the Homeric period the gods really went at it, using\nhumanity as players in their battles, like a game of chess, actually.\nCome to think of it, chess did originate in the realm of the gods after\nthe laws. Things were quite a mess back then, though, with a whole horde\nof demi-gods walking the earth, and it ended up snuffing out the first\nflames of democracy and leaving monarchies for the longest time.”",
        "“Homer’s stories were true, then?” I asked.",
        "“Very much so, but after the laws of physical abstinence were adopted\nthings mellowed out considerably, and men went back to their self-\nobsession, their material minds weren’t yet weaned from the physical\nrealm.”",
        "“So the very men who claimed mental superiority because they were free\nfrom superstitions and divine disillusionment were themselves victims of\ntheir own sophism, and while they thought themselves crowned with\nenlightenment, it was naught but the Phrygian caps of their prejudices\ntoward the material state?” I asked, with more than the average dose of\nirony and feeling, both for my subjects and myself.",
        "“Exactly, upon disinterested examination one finds the theater of human\nhistory to be one defined by a ludicrous melodramaticy, the soap opera\nof the gods,” he answered. “But we digress far from our point, Jehu,\nwhich is a discussion concerning the implementation of our plans of\naction formed in preparation of our current situation.”",
        "“So I had surmised,” I smiled at the reminder, “But tell me, what are\nyour plans, and what is the current situation?”",
        "“This is a time of fulfillment, with the events of many of our\nprophecies coming to pass. Now is a time of action and of hope. You, our\nkinsman redeemer, have come, and the time is ripe for victory and\ndomination, ripe, in short, for a return to natural existence, harmony\nbetween forces interior and exterior. Our plan, my dear Jehu, is to\nattack the Zards swiftly and fiercely and break their strongholds like\nthe walls of Jericho, literally.”",
        "“It sounds daring, certainly,” I said, “But is it not overly so? I was\nunder the impression that the Zards were much superior in force than the\nCanitaurs.”",
        "“In the southern regions, where you landed, yes, they are, but we rule\nthe northern sphere of action. Our forces actually form a soft\nequilibrium that keeps fate’s pendulum from straying from its neutral\nposition, so that a military action previously would not have been\npredictable, with either side being capable of winning. Under such\nconditions war is avoided, but now you have arrived. The Zards, as well\nas ourselves, have been expecting a kinsman redeemer, you see, and our\nwar has been kept from raging by the belief of each side that their god\nwould propel them to victory with certainty by the sending of one such\nas yourself. Your arrival changes things, it marks the beginning of our\ndominance,” he told me vaingloriously.",
        "“The muted felicity I have witnessed about my arrival is explained,\nthen,” I ventured, “Excitement that the end is near and victory close at\nhand, yet that feeling subdued by the realization that a period of\ndeeper darkness must first be gone through.”",
        "“Your words are true,” Wagner replied, “And yet I have a great\nconfidence in our plans, which have been matured through many years of\ncareful deliberation. As the time will never be more ready than at the\npresent, in the present we must act.”",
        "“What is your plan, then?” I asked.",
        "“It is calculated to end in the conquering of the Zards, and as such,\nonly an unexpected and unrelenting attack at the very heart of their\nstrength will succeed. Anything less will only bring them to a full\nalert, and then any battle will have to be drawn out with excessive\ncasualties on both sides. Therefore, we have decided upon an attack on\nNunami, their capital city and main strength, being the center and\nmajority of both their population and economy. Yet an outright siege of\nthe city is impossible for those very reasons, it being so self-\ncontained that it can resist bitterly, and its military is so clustered\nthat it can be brought into action almost instantly.",
        "“Considering those problems, it was deemed necessary to draw the Zards\naway from the city and destroy it in their absence, so that they are\nleft destitute of the means of war and sustenance, and rendered weak. To\ndo this, we have spent the last several years stockpiling huge\nquantities of liquid fervidus flamma, an extremely combustible\nsubstance. It is stored in an underground reservoir in the foothills of\nthe mountains, connected via aqueduct to Lake Umquam Renatusum. When the\ntime is ripe, we will empty it into the lake and set it aflame, and our\ncalculations show the flames reaching a height of five miles for a\nlength of six hours, which should be enough to gain the Zard’s\npreponderance,” Wagner explained.",
        "“But wouldn’t it catch the forest on fire and burn down your whole\nempire in the process?” I asked, alarmed at his apparent lack of\nvigilance.",
        "“We have been treating the trees on a ten mile radius with an anti-\nflammatory solution for several years as well, and it is quite\nimpossible to set them on fire.”",
        "“Which explains why you dared to have a fire pit in the trunk of a tree\noutpost.”",
        "“Yes,” he laughed, “We aren’t so foolhardy as we may seem. Appearances\ncan be deceiving.”",
        "“The exodus of the Zards from Nunami is almost guaranteed by the\nmortal’s natural curiosity and delight in the calamities of others,” I\nsaid, “But how do you plan on leveling the town before the remnant raise\nthe alarm and the mass of the people return?”",
        "“Atomic anionizers,” he returned.",
        "“Which are what? They sound like they are beyond my level of\nunderstanding.”",
        "“Not at all,” Wagner told me, “Do not be fooled by the technically\ncomplex sounding name. An atom is the smallest form into which matter\ncan be broken down into while still retaining its identity, and an anion\nis a positively charged ion, or in other words, an instance of an atom\nin which there are more electrons than protons, resulting in a charge of\nnegative electricity. An atomic anionizer is just what its name would\nimply: a device that morphs normal atoms into atoms with an extreme\nnegative charge by emitting massive amounts, to the tune of many\nmillions of moles, of solitary electrons into the air through a bombing\ndevice.”",
        "He went on, explaining the consequences of the weapon, “An atom, and\ntherefore all matter, which is made up of atoms, is engaged in a\nconstant revolution around the nucleus, in the same way in which our\nsolar system revolves around our sun, and our sun around the black hole\nin the center of the galaxy. This revolving motion is the basis for the\nformation of all matter that we know of, both in its smallest form, like\nthe atom, or its larger forms, like the galaxy. The electrons emitted\nfrom the atomic anionizer are drawn into an orbit around the nuclei of\nthe atoms of all the matter near which they are detonated, much like the\nway planets catch satellites and space debris into revolving rings\naround them. This addition of electrons gives the atoms such a powerful\nnegative charge that the poles of the atom, which regulate its rotations\nin much the same way that the earth’s axis, or poles, regulate its\nrotations, are thrown from their natural equilibrium, causing the poles\nto reverse. This, in turn, changes the direction in which the atoms\nrotate, and in the brief instant in which the force of the revolving\nmovement, or gravity, is not strong enough to retain the atom’s shape,\nit lapses, bringing the materials they make up crashing down in\ndisarray.",
        "“We will plant some of these ’atomic bombs’ inside the city of Nunami,\nand when they go off, the buildings themselves will implode and tumble\nto the ground. One hand-sized capsule can easily level almost ten square\nmiles, and we have enough of them to bring the Zards to their knees,\nwith plenty to spare for any circumstance.”",
        "“Wouldn’t the bombs kill those who set them off, though?” I asked him\nanxiously.",
        "“We have electron deflecting suits that negate the effects of the\nanionizers.”",
        "“I’m glad to hear it.”",
        "“And well you should be,” he grinned, which, as out of place as it would\nseem, looked completely natural on his countenance, “For you and I shall\nbe among the bombers. Our meeting must end here, though, my dear Jehu,\nfor we each have things to attend to in preparation for the attack on\nNunami. I will see you soon, until then, farewell.”",
        "“Farewell, Wagner,” I replied, and we each stood and bowed as we\nprepared to depart, each to our own occupations.",
        "With that our council ended, and, in the company of Bernibus, I was sent\nto another area of the fortress to be measured for an anti-electron\nsuit, in order to protect me from the effects of reverse revolution. We\ndidn’t converse in the beginning of our walk, for my mind was too busy\nsubconsciously thinking over what Wagner had said to have any conscious\nmeditations.",
        "We walked through the fortress towards the northern section, which held\nthe technological rooms, so as to get an anti-electron suit in the\nmaking for myself. Realizing that the fortress has been little\ndescribed, I will do so now. It was broken into six different sub-\ndivisions, each branching from the only entrance, which was in the\ncenter of them all, the different divisions connecting to it through\nlong, narrow defiles, or gorges, like the one at the entrance. This was\nfor security, each area being independently contained within the whole.\nThe six areas, or departments, as they were called, were as follows: the\nNorthern was the technological and industrial research and production\nfacilities; the Eastern was the residential department, containing also\nthe civil services, such as medical care and distribution centers; the\nSouthern was the agricultural and other food production areas, though\nthere was little besides agricultural, for the Canitaurs were strict\nvegetarians; the Western was for mining minerals and other raw materials\nto be used by the other departments. The other two departments were\nbelow the others, being differentiated between by the names Left and\nRight, the Left being the governmental offices, and the Right the\nmilitary headquarters, providing protections both civil and foreign\n(this was, incidentally, the beginning of the expression of the terms\nLeft and Right to denote ideological preferences, but I digress).\nUniform in all the fortress was the architecture, it being a strange mix\nbetween elegant and gentle arches and curves and brute practicality, for\nwhile the ceilings were high and open, and the walls wide, they were\nrendered homely by their plain surfaces and the absence of small\ntriflings, conditions that were necessitated because of its identity: an\nimpregnable fortress containing a highly organized and self-sufficient\ngovernmental society, each citizen having a particular duty for the\ncommon good, and each kept from an unfarcical personal identity by the\nmeans of a statist society.",
        "From the lower, governmental offices we went up a flight of stairs that\nwrapped round and round a tower-like tunnel, and soon reached the\ndepartmental portal. Once there, we took the northern tunnel, which\nopened into a large hall that stretched on almost endlessly, with hordes\nof tunnels branching off to the various agencies. There were a great\nmany Canitaurs working busily, preparing for the attack on Nunami and\nits possible results, which, though long prepared for, had a few last\nmoment components to be finished. Walking down the central through way,\nwe went to the far end of the hall, which, as it was a walk of at least\ntwo miles, afforded plenty of time for observation and reflecting, two\nthings that I am naturally given to. Accordingly, I turned to my\ncompanion, Bernibus, and offered in an almost philosophical way:",
        "“Your society seems to be flourishing, though I am not surprised, as you\nall seem vigorously industrious. I am amazed, however, that no one\nshirks from their job, no matter how menial or trifling.”",
        "“We all have our assigned jobs, and all know that one slovenly job may\ncost us dearly,” he said.",
        "“I suppose I am prejudiced by my conceptions of personal liberty, but it\nis contrary to my conscience that the state should have more duty than\nto enforce the individual liberties by common force.”",
        "“But we are at war, and we must do as we do, or be trampled underfoot.”",
        "“If all states went no further than justice permits, namely the\nprotection by common force the rights of individuality, liberty, and\nproperty, than there would be no room for conflict between states, and\nhence, no war.”",
        "“Yet it is our ideologies that bring war, besides, do not the ends\njustify the means?” he asked.",
        "“Your ideologies may cause conflict, yet it seems that your behemoth\nstates facilitate it into war. About the ends and the means, I don’t\nknow: I am no philosopher,” I answered.",
        "I sighed and was silent for a moment as we walked along, then, after a\nmoment or so, I said quietly to myself, “I’m not much of a kinsman\nredeemer, either.”",
        "We continued on through the hall without further conversation, and I\npaid little attention to my surroundings, so that while my eyes saw and\nmy mind displayed, my subconscious was not present in the effort, and\nthereby no memory was retained. This may seem to be the plot of an\nunimaginative writer to escape the use of that faculty, but as these are\nnothing but my written memories, and I make no claims of producing good\nfiction, I will leave that hall primarily to the minds of the reader.",
        "Soon after, we arrived at our destination, which was very nearly at the\nend of the hall, and entered to find that we were expected and a space\nopen for my fitting, which was soon accomplished, and my suit promised\nto be at my quarters the next morning. That would be just in time for\nthe departure of the raiding party, which was set to cut out and embark\nfor Nunami a little after that, in order to be in place in the hidden\ntreetop posts surrounding the city before nighttime, as the operation\nwas to begin at midnight. At first I thought that the attack was pushed\nforward in haste, but as I came to realize that my coming had been\nprophesied and a great amount of time had been spent preparing for this\nday, it seemed only natural that they should want to bring the\nhostilities to a close after such a long time. There were other\nconsiderations as well.
