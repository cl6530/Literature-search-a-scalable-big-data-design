        "\nMary Godwin Wollstonecraft Shelley (1797-1851)\nEnglish novelist, author of Frankenstein\n",
        "The story of Jonathan Swift and of the two women who gave their\nlives for love of him is familiar to every student of English\nliterature. Swift himself, both in letters and in politics, stands\nout a conspicuous figure in the reigns of King William III and\nQueen Anne. By writing Gulliver’s Travels he made himself\nimmortal. The external facts of his singular relations with two\ncharming women are sufficiently well known; but a definite\nexplanation of these facts has never yet been given. Swift held\nhis tongue with a repellent taciturnity. No one ever dared to\nquestion him. Whether the true solution belongs to the sphere of\npsychology or of physiology is a question that remains unanswered.",
        "But, as the case is one of the most puzzling in the annals of\nlove, it may be well to set forth the circumstances very briefly,\nto weigh the theories that have already been advanced, and to\nsuggest another.",
        "Jonathan Swift was of Yorkshire stock, though he happened to be\nborn in Dublin, and thus is often spoken of as “the great Irish\nsatirist,” or “the Irish dean.” It was, in truth, his fate to\nspend much of his life in Ireland, and to die there, near the\ncathedral where his remains now rest; but in truth he hated\nIreland and everything connected with it, just as he hated\nScotland and everything that was Scottish. He was an Englishman to\nthe core.",
        "High-stomached, proud, obstinate, and over-mastering, independence\nwas the dream of his life. He would accept no favors, lest he\nshould put himself under obligation; and although he could give\ngenerously, and even lavishly, he lived for the most part a\nmiser’s life, hoarding every penny and halfpenny that he could.\nWhatever one may think of him, there is no doubt that he was a\nvery manly man. Too many of his portraits give the impression of a\nsour, supercilious pedant; but the finest of them all–that by\nJervas–shows him as he must have been at his very prime, with a\nface that was almost handsome, and a look of attractive humor\nwhich strengthens rather than lessens the power of his brows and\nof the large, lambent eyes beneath them.",
        "At fifteen he entered Trinity College, in Dublin, where he read\nwidely but studied little, so that his degree was finally granted\nhim only as a special favor. At twenty-one he first visited\nEngland, and became secretary to Sir William Temple, at Moor Park.\nTemple, after a distinguished career in diplomacy, had retired to\nhis fine country estate in Surrey. He is remembered now for\nseveral things–for having entertained Peter the Great of Russia;\nfor having, while young, won the affections of Dorothy Osborne,\nwhose letters to him are charming in their grace and archness; for\nhaving been the patron of Jonathan Swift; and for fathering the\nyoung girl named Esther Johnson, a waif, born out of wedlock, to\nwhom Temple gave a place in his household.",
        "When Swift first met her, Esther Johnson was only eight years old;\nand part of his duties at Moor Park consisted in giving her what\nwas then an unusual education for a girl. She was, however, still\na child, and nothing serious could have passed between the raw\nyouth and this little girl who learned the lessons that he imposed\nupon her.",
        "Such acquaintance as they had was rudely broken off. Temple, a man\nof high position, treated Swift with an urbane condescension which\ndrove the young man’s independent soul into a frenzy. He returned\nto Ireland, where he was ordained a clergyman, and received a\nsmall parish at Kilroot, near Belfast.",
        "It was here that the love-note was first seriously heard in the\ndiscordant music of Swift’s career. A college friend of his named\nWaring had a sister who was about the age of Swift, and whom he\nmet quite frequently at Kilroot. Not very much is known of this\nepisode, but there is evidence that Swift fell in love with the\ngirl, whom he rather romantically called “Varina.”",
        "This cannot be called a serious love-affair. Swift was lonely, and\nJane Waring was probably the only girl of refinement who lived\nnear Kilroot. Furthermore, she had inherited a small fortune,\nwhile Swift was miserably poor, and had nothing to offer except\nthe shadowy prospect of future advancement in England. He was\ndefinitely refused by her; and it was this, perhaps, that led him\nto resolve on going back to England and making his peace with Sir\nWilliam Temple.",
        "On leaving, Swift wrote a passionate letter to Miss Waring–the\nonly true love-letter that remains to us of their correspondence.\nHe protests that he does not want Varina’s fortune, and that he\nwill wait until he is in a position to marry her on equal terms.\nThere is a smoldering flame of jealousy running through the\nletter. Swift charges her with being cold, affected, and willing\nto flirt with persons who are quite beneath her.",
        "Varina played no important part in Swift’s larger life thereafter;\nbut something must be said of this affair in order to show, first\nof all, that Swift’s love for her was due only to proximity, and\nthat when he ceased to feel it he could be not only hard, but\nharsh. His fiery spirit must have made a deep impression on Miss\nWaring; for though she at the time refused him, she afterward\nremembered him, and tried to renew their old relations. Indeed, no\nsooner had Swift been made rector of a larger parish, than Varina\nlet him know that she had changed her mind, and was ready to marry\nhim; but by this time Swift had lost all interest in her. He wrote\nan answer which even his truest admirers have called brutal.",
        "“Yes,” he said in substance, “I will marry you, though you have\ntreated me vilely, and though you are living in a sort of social\nsink. I am still poor, though you probably think otherwise.\nHowever, I will marry you on certain conditions. First, you must\nbe educated, so that you can entertain me. Next, you must put up\nwith all my whims and likes and dislikes. Then you must live\nwherever I please. On these terms I will take you, without\nreference to your looks or to your income. As to the first,\ncleanliness is all that I require; as to the second, I only ask\nthat it be enough.”",
        "Such a letter as this was like a blow from a bludgeon. The\ninsolence, the contempt, and the hardness of it were such as no\nself-respecting woman could endure. It put an end to their\nacquaintance, as Swift undoubtedly intended it should do. He would\nhave been less censurable had he struck Varina with his fist or\nkicked her.",
        "The true reason for Swift’s utter change of heart is found, no\ndoubt, in the beginning of what was destined to be his long\nintimacy with Esther Johnson. When Swift left Sir William Temple’s\nin a huff, Esther had been a mere schoolgirl. Now, on his return,\nshe was fifteen years of age, and seemed older. She had blossomed\nout into a very comely girl, vivacious, clever, and physically\nwell developed, with dark hair, sparkling eyes, and features that\nwere unusually regular and lovely.",
        "For three years the two were close friends and intimate\nassociates, though it cannot he said that Swift ever made open\nlove to her. To the outward eye they were no more than fellow\nworkers. Yet love does not need the spoken word and the formal\ndeclaration to give it life and make it deep and strong. Esther\nJohnson, to whom Swift gave the pet name of “Stella,” grew into\nthe existence of this fiery, hold, and independent genius. All\nthat he did she knew. She was his confidante. As to his writings,\nhis hopes, and his enmities, she was the mistress of all his\nsecrets. For her, at last, no other man existed.",
        "On Sir William Temple’s death, Esther John son came into a small\nfortune, though she now lost her home at Moor Park. Swift returned\nto Ireland, and soon afterward he invited Stella to join him\nthere.",
        "Swift was now thirty-four years of age, and Stella a very\nattractive girl of twenty. One might have expected that the two\nwould marry, and yet they did not do so. Every precaution was\ntaken to avoid anything like scandal. Stella was accompanied by a\nfriend–a widow named Mrs. Dingley–without whose presence, or\nthat of some third person, Swift never saw Esther Johnson. When\nSwift was absent, how ever, the two ladies occupied his\napartments; and Stella became more than ever essential to his\nhappiness.",
        "When they were separated for any length of time Swift wrote to\nStella in a sort of baby-talk, which they called “the little\nlanguage.” It was made up of curious abbreviations and childish\nwords, growing more and more complicated as the years went on. It\nis interesting to think of this stern and often savage genius, who\nloved to hate, and whose hate was almost less terrible than his\nlove, babbling and prattling in little half caressing sentences,\nas a mother might babble over her first child. Pedantic writers\nhave professed to find in Swift’s use of this “little language\"\nthe coming shadow of that insanity which struck him down in his\nold age.",
        "As it is, these letters are among the curiosities of amatory\ncorrespondence. When Swift writes “oo” for “you,” and “deelest\"\nfor “dearest,” and “vely” for “very,” there is no need of an\ninterpreter; but “rettle” for “let ter,” “dallars” for “girls,\"\nand “givar” for “devil,” are at first rather difficult to guess.\nThen there is a system of abbreviating. “Md” means “my dear,\"\n\"Ppt” means “poppet,” and “Pdfr,” with which Swift sometimes\nsigned his epistles, “poor, dear, foolish rogue.”",
        "The letters reveal how very closely the two were bound together,\nyet still there was no talk of marriage. On one occasion, after\nthey had been together for three years in Ireland, Stella might\nhave married another man. This was a friend of Swift’s, one Dr.\nTisdall, who made energetic love to the sweet-faced English girl.\nTisdall accused Swift of poisoning Stella’s mind against him.\nSwift replied that such was not the case. He said that no feelings\nof his own would ever lead him to influence the girl if she\npreferred another.",
        "It is quite sure, then, that Stella clung wholly to Swift, and\ncared nothing for the proffered love of any other man. Thus\nthrough the years the relations of the two remained unchanged,\nuntil in 1710 Swift left Ireland and appeared as a very brilliant\nfigure in the London drawing-rooms of the great Tory leaders of\nthe day.",
        "He was now a man of mark, because of his ability as a\ncontroversialist. He had learned the manners of the world, and he\ncarried him self with an air of power which impressed all those\nwho met him. Among these persons was a Miss Hester–or Esther–\nVanhomrigh, the daughter of a rather wealthy widow who was living\nin London at that time. Miss Vanhomrigh–a name which she and her\nmother pronounced “Vanmeury\"–was then seventeen years of age, or\ntwelve years younger than the patient Stella.",
        "Esther Johnson, through her long acquaintance with Swift, and from\nhis confidence in her, had come to treat him almost as an\nintellectual equal. She knew all his moods, some of which were\nvery difficult, and she bore them all; though when he was most\ntyrannous she became only passive, waiting, with a woman’s wisdom,\nfor the tempest to blow over.",
        "Miss Vanhomrigh, on the other hand, was one of those girls who,\nthough they have high spirit, take an almost voluptuous delight in\nyielding to a spirit that is stronger still. This beautiful\ncreature felt a positive fascination in Swift’s presence and his\nimperious manner. When his eyes flashed, and his voice thundered\nout words of anger, she looked at him with adoration, and bowed in\na sort of ecstasy before him. If he chose to accost a great lady\nwith “Well, madam, are you as ill-natured and disagreeable as when\nI met you last?” Esther Vanhomrigh thrilled at the insolent\naudacity of the man. Her evident fondness for him exercised a\nseductive influence over Swift.",
        "As the two were thrown more and more together, the girl lost all\nher self-control. Swift did not in any sense make love to her,\nthough he gave her the somewhat fanciful name of “Vanessa\"; but\nshe, driven on by a high-strung, unbridled temperament, made open\nlove to him. When he was about to return to Ireland, there came\none startling moment when Vanessa flung herself into the arms of\nSwift, and amazed him by pouring out a torrent of passionate\nendearments.",
        "Swift seems to have been surprised. He did what he could to quiet\nher. He told her that they were too unequal in years and fortune\nfor anything but friendship, and he offered to give her as much\nfriendship as she desired.",
        "Doubtless he thought that, after returning to Ireland, he would\nnot see Vanessa any more. In this, however, he was mistaken. An\nardent girl, with a fortune of her own, was not to be kept from\nthe man whom absence only made her love the more. In addition,\nSwift carried on his correspondence with her, which served to fan\nthe flame and to increase the sway that Swift had already\nacquired.",
        "Vanessa wrote, and with every letter she burned and pined. Swift\nreplied, and each reply enhanced her yearning for him. Ere long,\nVanessa’s mother died, and Vanessa herself hastened to Ireland and\ntook up her residence near Dublin. There, for years, was enacted\nthis tragic comedy–Esther Johnson was near Swift, and had all his\nconfidence; Esther Vanhomrigh was kept apart from him, while still\nreceiving missives from him, and, later, even visits.",
        "It was at this time, after he had become dean of St. Patrick’s\nCathedral, in Dublin, that Swift was married to Esther Johnson–\nfor it seems probable that the ceremony took place, though it was\nnothing more than a form. They still saw each other only in the\npresence of a third person. Nevertheless, some knowledge of their\nclose relationship leaked out. Stella had been jealous of her\nrival during the years that Swift spent in London. Vanessa was now\ntold that Swift was married to the other woman, or that she was\nhis mistress. Writhing with jealousy, she wrote directly to\nStella, and asked whether she was Dean Swift’s wife. In answer\nStella replied that she was, and then she sent Vanessa’s letter to\nSwift himself.",
        "All the fury of his nature was roused in him; and he was a man who\ncould be very terrible when angry. He might have remembered the\nintense love which Vanessa bore for him, the humility with which\nshe had accepted his conditions, and, finally, the loneliness of\nthis girl.",
        "But Swift was utterly unsparing. No gleam of pity entered his\nheart as he leaped upon a horse and galloped out to Marley Abbey,\nwhere she was living–\"his prominent eyes arched by jet-black\nbrows and glaring with the green fury of a cat’s.” Reaching the\nhouse, he dashed into it, with something awful in his looks, made\nhis way to Vanessa, threw her letter down upon the table and,\nafter giving her one frightful glare, turned on his heel, and in a\nmoment more was galloping back to Dublin.",
        "The girl fell to the floor in an agony of terror and remorse. She\nwas taken to her room, and only three weeks afterward was carried\nforth, having died literally of a broken heart.",
        "Five years later, Stella also died, withering away a sacrifice to\nwhat the world has called Swift’s cruel heartlessness and egotism.\nHis greatest public triumphs came to him in his final years of\nmelancholy isolation; but in spite of the applause that greeted\nThe Drapier Letters and Gulliver’s Travels, he brooded morbidly\nover his past life. At last his powerful mind gave way, so that he\ndied a victim to senile dementia. By his directions his body was\ninterred in the same coffin with Stella’s, in the cathedral of\nwhich he had been dean.",
        "Such is the story of Dean Swift, and it has always suggested\nseveral curious questions. Why, if he loved Stella, did he not\nmarry her long before? Why, when he married her, did he treat her\nstill as if she were not his wife? Why did he allow Vanessa’s love\nto run like a scarlet thread across the fabric of the other\naffection, which must have been so strong?",
        "Many answers have been given to these questions. That which was\nformulated by Sir Walter Scott is a simple one, and has been\ngenerally accepted. Scott believed that Swift was physically\nincapacitated for marriage, and that he needed feminine sympathy,\nwhich he took where he could get it, without feeling bound to give\nanything in return.",
        "If Scott’s explanation be the true one, it still leaves Swift\nexposed to ignominy as a monster of ingratitude. Therefore, many\nof his biographers have sought other explanations. No one can\npalliate his conduct toward Vanessa; but Sir Leslie Stephen makes\na plea for him with reference to Stella. Sir Leslie points out\nthat until Swift became dean of St. Patrick’s his income was far\ntoo small to marry on, and that after his brilliant but\ndisappointing three years in London, when his prospects of\nadvancement were ruined, he felt himself a broken man.",
        "Furthermore, his health was always precarious, since he suffered\nfrom a distressing illness which attacked him at intervals,\nrendering him both deaf and giddy. The disease is now known as\nMeniere’s disease, from its classification by the French\nphysician, Meniere, in 1861. Swift felt that he lived in constant\ndanger of some sudden stroke that would deprive him either of life\nor reason; and his ultimate insanity makes it appear that his\nforebodings were not wholly futile. Therefore, though he married\nStella, he kept the marriage secret, thus leaving her free, in\ncase of his demise, to marry as a maiden, and not to be regarded\nas a widow.",
        "Sir Leslie offers the further plea that, after all, Stella’s life\nwas what she chose to make it. She enjoyed Swift’s friendship,\nwhich she preferred to the love of any other man.",
        "Another view is that of Dr. Richard Garnett, who has discussed the\nquestion with some subtlety. “Swift,” says Dr. Garnett, “was by\nnature devoid of passion. He was fully capable of friendship, but\nnot of love. The spiritual realm, whether of divine or earthly\nthings, was a region closed to him, where he never set foot.” On\nthe side of friendship he must greatly have preferred Stella to\nVanessa, and yet the latter assailed him on his weakest side–on\nthe side of his love of imperious domination.",
        "Vanessa hugged the fetters to which Stella merely submitted.\nFlattered to excess by her surrender, yet conscious of his\nobligations and his real preference, he could neither discard the\none beauty nor desert the other.",
        "Therefore, he temporized with both of them, and when the choice\nwas forced upon him he madly struck down the woman for whom he\ncared the less.",
        "One may accept Dr. Garnett’s theory with a somewhat altered\nconclusion. It is not true, as a matter of recorded fact, that\nSwift was incapable of passion, for when a boy at college he was\nsought out by various young women, and he sought them out in turn.\nHis fiery letter to Miss Waring points to the same conclusion.\nWhen Esther Johnson began to love him he was heart-free, yet\nunable, because of his straitened means, to marry. But Esther\nJohnson always appealed more to his reason, his friendship, and\nhis comfort, than to his love, using the word in its material,\nphysical sense. This love was stirred in him by Vanessa. Yet when\nhe met Vanessa he had already gone too far with Esther Johnson to\nbreak the bond which had so long united them, nor could he think\nof a life without her, for she was to him his other self.",
        "At the same time, his more romantic association with Vanessa\nroused those instincts which he had scarcely known himself to be\npossessed of. His position was, therefore, most embarrassing. He\nhoped to end it when he left London and returned to Ireland; but\nfate was unkind to him in this, because Vanessa followed him. He\nlacked the will to be frank with her, and thus he stood a\nwretched, halting victim of his own dual nature.",
        "He was a clergyman, and at heart religious. He had also a sense of\nhonor, and both of these traits compelled him to remain true to\nEsther Johnson. The terrible outbreak which brought about\nVanessa’s death was probably the wild frenzy of a tortured soul.\nIt recalls the picture of some fierce animal brought at last to\nbay, and venting its own anguish upon any object that is within\nreach of its fangs and claws.",
        "No matter how the story may be told, it makes one shiver, for it\nis a tragedy in which the three participants all meet their doom–\none crushed by a lightning-bolt of unreasoning anger, the other\nwasting away through hope deferred; while the man whom the world\nwill always hold responsible was himself destined to end his years\nblind and sleepless, bequeathing his fortune to a madhouse, and\nsaying, with his last muttered breath:",
        "“I am a fool!”",
        "A great deal has been said and written in favor of early marriage;\nand, in a general way, early marriage may be an admirable thing.\nYoung men and young women who have no special gift of imagination,\nand who have practically reached their full mental development at\ntwenty-one or twenty-two–or earlier, even in their teens–may\nmarry safely; because they are already what they will be. They are\nnot going to experience any growth upward and outward. Passing\nyears simply bring them more closely together, until they have\nsettled down into a sort of domestic unity, by which they think\nalike, act alike, and even gradually come to look alike.",
        "But early wedlock spells tragedy to the man or the woman of\ngenius. In their teens they have only begun to grow. What they\nwill be ten years hence, no one can prophesy. Therefore, to mate\nso early in life is to insure almost certain storm and stress,\nand, in the end, domestic wreckage.",
        "As a rule, it is the man, and not the woman, who makes the false\nstep; because it is the man who elects to marry when he is still\nvery young. If he choose some ill-fitting, commonplace, and\nunresponsive nature to match his own, it is he who is bound in the\ncourse of time to learn his great mistake. When the splendid eagle\nshall have got his growth, and shall begin to soar up into the\nvault of heaven, the poor little barn-yard fowl that he once\nbelieved to be his equal seems very far away in everything. He\ndiscovers that she is quite unable to follow him in his towering\nflights.",
        "The story of Percy Bysshe Shelley is a singular one. The\ncircumstances of his early marriage were strange. The breaking of\nhis marriage-bond was also strange. Shelley himself was an\nextraordinary creature. He was blamed a great deal in his lifetime\nfor what he did, and since then some have echoed the reproach. Yet\nit would seem as if, at the very beginning of his life, he was put\ninto a false position against his will. Because of this he was\nmisunderstood until the end of his brief and brilliant and erratic\ncareer.",
        "In 1792 the French Revolution burst into flame, the mob of Paris\nstormed the Tuileries, the King of France was cast into a dungeon\nto await his execution, and the wild sons of anarchy flung their\ngauntlet of defiance into the face of Europe. In this tremendous\nyear was born young Shelley; and perhaps his nature represented\nthe spirit of the time.",
        "Certainly, neither from his father nor from his mother did he\nderive that perpetual unrest and that frantic fondness for revolt\nwhich blazed out in the poet when he was still a boy. His father,\nMr. Timothy Shelley, was a very usual, thick-headed, unromantic\nEnglish squire. His mother–a woman of much beauty, but of no\nexceptional traits–was the daughter of another squire, and at the\ntime of her marriage was simply one of ten thousand fresh-faced,\npleasant-spoken English country girls. If we look for a strain of\nthe romantic in Shelley’s ancestry, we shall have to find it in\nthe person of his grandfather, who was a very remarkable and\npowerful character.",
        "This person, Bysshe Shelley by name, had in his youth been\nassociated with some mystery. He was not born in England, but in\nAmerica–and in those days the name “America” meant almost\nanything indefinite and peculiar. However this might be, Bysshe\nShelley, though a scion of a good old English family, had wandered\nin strange lands, and it was whispered that he had seen strange\nsights and done strange things. According to one legend, he had\nbeen married in America, though no one knew whether his wife was\nwhite or black, or how he had got rid of her.",
        "He might have remained in America all his life, had not a small\ninheritance fallen to his share. This brought him back to England,\nand he soon found that England was in reality the place to make\nhis fortune. He was a man of magnificent physique. His rovings had\ngiven him ease and grace, and the power which comes from a wide\nexperience of life. He could be extremely pleasing when he chose;\nand he soon won his way into the good graces of a rich heiress,\nwhom he married.",
        "With her wealth he became an important personage, and consorted\nwith gentlemen and statesmen of influence, attaching himself\nparticularly to the Duke of Northumberland, by whose influence he\nwas made a baronet. When his rich wife died, Shelley married a\nstill richer bride; and so this man, who started out as a mere\nadventurer without a shilling to his name, died in 1813, leaving\nmore than a million dollars in cash, with lands whose rent-roll\nyielded a hundred thousand dollars every year.",
        "If any touch of the romantic which we find in Shelley is a matter\nof heredity, we must trace it to this able, daring, restless, and\nmagnificent old grandfather, who was the beau ideal of an English\nsquire–the sort of squire who had added foreign graces to native\nsturdiness. But young Shelley, the future poet, seemed scarcely to\nbe English at all. As a young boy he cared nothing for athletic\nsports. He was given to much reading. He thought a good deal about\nabstractions with which most schoolboys never concern themselves\nat all.",
        "Consequently, both in private schools and afterward at Eton, he\nbecame a sort of rebel against authority. He resisted the fagging-\nsystem. He spoke contemptuously of physical prowess. He disliked\nanything that he was obliged to do, and he rushed eagerly into\nwhatever was forbidden.",
        "Finally, when he was sent to University College, Oxford, he broke\nall bounds. At a time when Tory England was aghast over the French\nRevolution and its results, Shelley talked of liberty and equality\non all occasions. He made friends with an uncouth but able fellow\nstudent, who bore the remarkable name of Thomas Jefferson Hogg–a\nname that seems rampant with republicanism–and very soon he got\nhimself expelled from the university for publishing a little tract\nof an infidel character called “A Defense of Atheism.”",
        "His expulsion for such a cause naturally shocked his father. It\nprobably disturbed Shelley himself; but, after all, it gave him\nsome satisfaction to be a martyr for the cause of free speech. He\nwent to London with his friend Hogg, and took lodgings there. He\nread omnivorously–Hogg says as much as sixteen hours a day. He\nwould walk through the most crowded streets poring over a volume,\nwhile holding another under one arm.",
        "His mind was full of fancies. He had begun what was afterward\ncalled “his passion for reforming everything.” He despised most of\nthe laws of England. He thought its Parliament ridiculous. He\nhated its religion. He was particularly opposed to marriage. This\nlast fact gives some point to the circumstances which almost\nimmediately confronted him.",
        "Shelley was now about nineteen years old–an age at which most\nEnglish boys are emerging from the public schools, and are still\nin the hobbledehoy stage of their formation. In a way, he was\nquite far from boyish; yet in his knowledge of life he was little\nmore than a mere child. He knew nothing thoroughly–much less the\nways of men and women. He had no visible means of existence except\na small allowance from his father. His four sisters, who were at a\nboarding-school on Clapham Common, used to save their pin-money\nand send it to their gifted brother so that he might not actually\nstarve. These sisters he used to call upon from time to time, and\nthrough them he made the acquaintance of a sixteen-year-old girl\nnamed Harriet Westbrook.",
        "Harriet Westbrook was the daughter of a black-visaged keeper of a\ncoffee-house in Mount Street, called “Jew Westbrook,” partly\nbecause of his complexion, and partly because of his ability to\nretain what he had made. He was, indeed, fairly well off, and had\nsent his younger daughter, Harriet, to the school where Shelley’s\nsisters studied.",
        "Harriet Westbrook seems to have been a most precocious person. Any\ngirl of sixteen is, of course, a great deal older and more mature\nthan a youth of nineteen. In the present instance Harriet might\nhave been Shelley’s senior by five years. There is no doubt that\nshe fell in love with him; but, having done so, she by no means\nacted in the shy and timid way that would have been most natural\nto a very young girl in her first love-affair. Having decided that\nshe wanted him, she made up her mind to get Mm at any cost, and\nher audacity was equaled only by his simplicity. She was rather\nattractive in appearance, with abundant hair, a plump figure, and\na pink-and-white complexion. This description makes of her a\nrather doll-like girl; but doll-like girls are just the sort to\nattract an inexperienced young man who has yet to learn that\nbeauty and charm are quite distinct from prettiness, and\ninfinitely superior to it.",
        "In addition to her prettiness, Harriet Westbrook had a vivacious\nmanner and talked quite pleasingly. She was likewise not a bad\nlistener; and she would listen by the hour to Shelley in his\nrhapsodies about chemistry, poetry, the failure of Christianity,\nthe national debt, and human liberty, all of which he jumbled up\nwithout much knowledge, but in a lyric strain of impassioned\neagerness which would probably have made the multiplication-table\nthrilling.",
        "For Shelley himself was a creature of extraordinary fascination,\nboth then and afterward. There are no likenesses of him that do\nhim justice, because they cannot convey that singular appeal which\nthe man himself made to almost every one who met him.",
        "The eminent painter, Mulready, once said that Shelley was too\nbeautiful for portraiture; and yet the descriptions of him hardly\nseem to bear this out. He was quite tall and slender, but he\nstooped so much as to make him appear undersized. His head was\nvery small-quite disproportionately so; but this was counteracted\nto the eye by his long and tumbled hair which, when excited, he\nwould rub and twist in a thousand different directions until it\nwas actually bushy. His eyes and mouth were his best features. The\nformer were of a deep violet blue, and when Shelley felt deeply\nmoved they seemed luminous with a wonderful and almost unearthly\nlight. His mouth was finely chiseled, and might be regarded as\nrepresenting perfection.",
        "One great defect he had, and this might well have overbalanced his\nattractive face. The defect in question was his voice. One would\nhave expected to hear from him melodious sounds, and vocal tones\nboth rich and penetrating; but, as a matter of fact, his voice was\nshrill at the very best, and became actually discordant and\npeacock-like in moments of emotion.",
        "Such, then, was Shelley, star-eyed, with the delicate complexion\nof a girl, wonderfully mobile in his features, yet speaking in a\nvoice high pitched and almost raucous. For the rest, he arrayed\nhimself with care and in expensive clothing, even though he took\nno thought of neatness, so that his garments were almost always\nrumpled and wrinkled from his frequent writhings on couches and on\nthe floor. Shelley had a strange and almost primitive habit of\nrolling on the earth, and another of thrusting his tousled head\nclose up to the hottest fire in the house, or of lying in the\nglaring sun when out of doors. It is related that he composed one\nof his finest poems–\"The Cenci\"–in Italy, while stretched out\nwith face upturned to an almost tropical sun.",
        "But such as he was, and though he was not yet famous, Harriet\nWestbrook, the rosy-faced schoolgirl, fell in love with him, and\nrather plainly let him know that she had done so. There are a\nthousand ways in which a woman can convey this information without\ndoing anything un-maidenly; and of all these little arts Miss\nWestbrook was instinctively a mistress.",
        "She played upon Shelley’s feelings by telling him that her father\nwas cruel to her, and that he contemplated actions still more\ncruel. There is something absurdly comical about the grievance\nwhich she brought to Shelley; but it is much more comical to note\nthe tremendous seriousness with which he took it. He wrote to his\nfriend Hogg:",
        "Her father has persecuted her in a most horrible way, by\nendeavoring to compel her to go to school. She asked my advice;\nresistance was the answer. At the same time I essayed to mollify\nMr. Westbrook, in vain! I advised her to resist. She wrote to say\nthat resistance was useless, but that she would fly with me and\nthrow herself on my protection.",
        "Some letters that have recently come to light show that there was\na dramatic scene between Harriet Westbrook and Shelley–a scene in\nthe course of which she threw her arms about his neck and wept\nupon his shoulder. Here was a curious situation. Shelley was not\nat all in love with her. He had explicitly declared this only a\nshort time before. Yet here was a pretty girl about to suffer the\n\"horrible persecution” of being sent to school, and finding no\nalternative save to “throw herself on his protection\"–in other\nwords, to let him treat her as he would, and to become his\nmistress.",
        "The absurdity of the situation makes one smile. Common sense\nshould have led some one to box Harriet’s ears and send her off to\nschool without a moment’s hesitation; while as for Shelley, he\nshould have been told how ludicrous was the whole affair. But he\nwas only nineteen, and she was only sixteen, and the crisis seemed\nportentous. Nothing could be more flattering to a young man’s\nvanity than to have this girl cast herself upon him for\nprotection. It did not really matter that he had not loved her\nhitherto, and that he was already half engaged to another Harriet\n–his cousin, Miss Grove. He could not stop and reason with\nhimself. He must like a true knight rescue lovely girlhood from\nthe horrors of a school!",
        "It is not unlikely that this whole affair was partly managed or\nmanipulated by the girl’s father. Jew Westbrook knew that Shelley\nwas related to rich and titled people, and that he was certain, if\nhe lived, to become Sir Percy, and to be the heir of his\ngrandfather’s estates. Hence it may be that Harriet’s queer\nconduct was not wholly of her own prompting.",
        "In any case, however, it proved to be successful. Shelley’s ardent\nand impulsive nature could not bear to see a girl in tears and\nappealing for his help. Hence, though in his heart she was very\nlittle to him, his romantic nature gave up for her sake the\naffection that he had felt for his cousin, his own disbelief in\nmarriage, and finally the common sense which ought to have told\nhim not to marry any one on two hundred pounds a year.",
        "So the pair set off for Edinburgh by stagecoach. It was a weary\nand most uncomfortable journey. When they reached the Scottish\ncapital, they were married by the Scottish law. Their money was\nall gone; but their landlord, with a jovial sympathy for romance,\nlet them have a room, and treated them to a rather promiscuous\nwedding-banquet, in which every one in the house participated.",
        "Such is the story of Shelley’s marriage, contracted at nineteen\nwith a girl of sixteen who most certainly lured him on against his\nown better judgment and in the absence of any actual love.",
        "The girl whom he had taken to himself was a well-meaning little\nthing. She tried for a time to meet her husband’s moods and to be\na real companion to him. But what could one expect from such a\nunion? Shelley’s father withdrew the income which he had\npreviously given. Jew Westbrook refused to contribute anything,\nhoping, probably, that this course would bring the Shelleys to the\nrescue. But as it was, the young pair drifted about from place to\nplace, getting very precarious supplies, running deeper into debt\neach day, and finding less and less to admire in each other.",
        "Shelley took to laudanum. Harriet dropped her abstruse studies,\nwhich she had taken up to please her husband, but which could only\npuzzle her small brain. She soon developed some of the unpleasant\ntraits of the class to which she belonged. In this her sister\nEliza–a hard and grasping middle-aged woman–had her share. She\nset Harriet against her husband, and made life less endurable for\nboth. She was so much older than the pair that she came in and\nruled their household like a typical stepmother.",
        "A child was born, and Shelley very generously went through a\nsecond form of marriage, so as to comply with the English law; but\nby this time there was little hope of righting things again.\nShelley was much offended because Harriet would not nurse the\nchild. He believed her hard because she saw without emotion an\noperation performed upon the infant.",
        "Finally, when Shelley at last came into a considerable sum of\nmoney, Harriet and Eliza made no pretense of caring for anything\nexcept the spending of it in “bonnet-shops” and on carriages and\ndisplay. In time–that is to say, in three years after their\nmarriage–Harriet left her husband and went to London and to Bath,\nprompted by her elder sister.",
        "This proved to be the end of an unfortunate marriage. Word was\nbrought to Shelley that his wife was no longer faithful to him.\nHe, on his side, had carried on a semi-sentimental platonic\ncorrespondence with a schoolmistress, one Miss Hitchener. But\nuntil now his life had been one great mistake–a life of\nrestlessness, of unsatisfied longing, of a desire that had no\nname. Then came the perhaps inevitable meeting with the one whom\nhe should have met before.",
        "Shelley had taken a great interest in William Godwin, the writer\nand radical philosopher. Godwin’s household was a strange one.\nThere was Fanny Imlay, a child born out of wedlock, the offspring\nof Gilbert Imlay, an American merchant, and of Mary\nWollstonecraft, whom Godwin had subsequently married. There was\nalso a singularly striking girl who then styled herself Mary Jane\nClairmont, and who was afterward known as Claire Clairmont, she\nand her brother being the early children of Godwin’s second wife.",
        "One day in 1814, Shelley called on Godwin, and found there a\nbeautiful young girl in her seventeenth year, “with shapely golden\nhead, a face very pale and pure, a great forehead, earnest hazel\neyes, and an expression at once of sensibility and firmness about\nher delicately curved lips.” This was Mary Godwin–one who had\ninherited her mother’s power of mind and likewise her grace and\nsweetness.",
        "From the very moment of their meeting Shelley and this girl were\nfated to be joined together, and both of them were well aware of\nit. Each felt the other’s presence exert a magnetic thrill. Each\nlistened eagerly to what the other said. Each thought of nothing,\nand each cared for nothing, in the other’s absence. It was a great\ncompelling elemental force which drove the two together and bound\nthem fast. Beside this marvelous experience, how pale and pitiful\nand paltry seemed the affectations of Harriet Westbrook!",
        "In little more than a month from the time of their first meeting,\nShelley and Mary Godwin and Miss Clairmont left Godwin’s house at\nfour o ’clock in the morning, and hurried across the Channel to\nCalais. They wandered almost like vagabonds across France, eating\nblack bread and the coarsest fare, walking on the highways when\nthey could not afford to ride, and putting up with every possible\ninconvenience. Yet it is worth noting that neither then nor at any\nother time did either Shelley or Mary regret what they had done.\nTo the very end of the poet’s brief career they were inseparable.",
        "Later he was able to pension Harriet, who, being of a morbid\ndisposition, ended her life by drowning–not, it may be said,\nbecause of grief for Shelley. It has been told that Fanny Imlay,\nMary’s sister, likewise committed suicide because Shelley did not\ncare for her, but this has also been disproved. There was really\nnothing to mar the inner happiness of the poet and the woman who,\nat the very end, became his wife. Living, as they did, in Italy\nand Switzerland, they saw much of their own countrymen, such as\nLandor and Leigh Hunt and Byron, to whose fascinations poor Miss\nClairmont yielded, and became the mother of the little girl\nAllegra.",
        "But there could have been no truer union than this of Shelley’s\nwith the woman whom nature had intended for him. It was in his\nlove-life, far more than in his poetry, that he attained\ncompleteness. When he died by drowning, in 1822, and his body was\nburned in the presence of Lord Byron, he was truly mourned by the\none whom he had only lately made his wife. As a poet he never\nreached the same perfection; for his genius was fitful and\nuncertain, rare in its flights, and mingled always with that which\ndisappoints.",
        "As the lover and husband of Mary Godwin, there was nothing left to\nwish. In his verse, however, the truest word concerning him will\nalways be that exquisite sentence of Matthew Arnold:",
        "“A beautiful and ineffectual angel beating his luminous wings\nagainst the void in vain.”",
        "To most persons, Tennyson was a remote and romantic figure. His\nhomes in the Isle of Wight and at Aldworth had a dignified\nseclusion about them which was very appropriate to so great a\npoet, and invested him with a certain awe through which the\nmultitude rarely penetrated. As a matter of fact, however, he was\nan excellent companion, a ready talker, and gifted with so much\nwit that it is a pity that more of his sayings have not been\npreserved to us.",
        "One of the best known is that which was drawn from him after he\nand a number of friends had been spending an hour in company with\nMr. and Mrs. Carlyle. The two Carlyles were unfortunately at their\nworst, and gave a superb specimen of domestic “nagging.” Each\ncaught up whatever the other said, and either turned it into\nridicule, or tried to make the author of it an object of contempt.",
        "This was, of course, exceedingly uncomfortable for such strangers\nas were present, and it certainly gave no pleasure to their\nfriends. On leaving the house, some one said to Tennyson:",
        "“Isn’t it a pity that such a couple ever married?”",
        "“No, no,” said Tennyson, with a sort of smile under his rough\nbeard. “It’s much better that two people should be made unhappy\nthan four.”",
        "The world has pretty nearly come around to the verdict of the poet\nlaureate. It is not probable that Thomas Carlyle would have made\nany woman happy as his wife, or that Jane Baillie Welsh would have\nmade any man happy as her husband.",
        "This sort of speculation would never have occurred had not Mr.\nFroude, in the early eighties, given his story about the Carlyles\nto the world. Carlyle went to his grave, an old man, highly\nhonored, and with no trail of gossip behind him. His wife had died\nsome sixteen years before, leaving a brilliant memory. The books\nof Mr. Froude seemed for a moment to have desecrated the grave,\nand to have shed a sudden and sinister light upon those who could\nnot make the least defense for themselves.",
        "For a moment, Carlyle seemed to have been a monster of harshness,\ncruelty, and almost brutish feeling. On the other side, his wife\ntook on the color of an evil-speaking, evil-thinking shrew, who\ntormented the life of her husband, and allowed herself to be\npossessed by some demon of unrest and discontent, such as few\nwomen of her station are ever known to suffer from.",
        "Nor was it merely that the two were apparently ill-mated and\nunhappy with each other. There were hints and innuendos which\nlooked toward some hidden cause for this unhappiness, and which\naroused the curiosity of every one. That they might be clearer,\nFroude afterward wrote a book, bringing out more plainly–indeed,\ntoo plainly–his explanation of the Carlyle family skeleton. A\nmultitude of documents then came from every quarter, and from\nalmost every one who had known either of the Carlyles. Perhaps the\nresult to-day has been more injurious to Froude than to the two\nCarlyles.",
        "Many persons unjustly speak of Froude as having violated the\nconfidence of his friends in publishing the letters of Mr. and\nMrs. Carlyle. They take no heed of the fact that in doing this he\nwas obeying Carlyle’s express wishes, left behind in writing, and\noften urged on Froude while Carlyle was still alive. Whether or\nnot Froude ought to have accepted such a trust, one may perhaps\nhesitate to decide. That he did so is probably because he felt\nthat if he refused, Carlyle might commit the same duty to another,\nwho would discharge it with less delicacy and less discretion.",
        "As it is, the blame, if it rests upon any one, should rest upon\nCarlyle. He collected the letters. He wrote the lines which burn\nand scorch with self-reproach. It is he who pressed upon the\nreluctant Froude the duty of printing and publishing a series of\ndocuments which, for the most part, should never have been\npublished at all, and which have done equal harm to Carlyle, to\nhis wife, and to Froude himself.",
        "Now that everything has been written that is likely to be written\nby those claiming to possess personal knowledge of the subject,\nlet us take up the volumes, and likewise the scattered fragments,\nand seek to penetrate the mystery of the most ill-assorted couple\nknown to modern literature.",
        "It is not necessary to bring to light, and in regular order, the\nexternal history of Thomas Carlyle, or of Jane Baillie Welsh, who\nmarried him. There is an extraordinary amount of rather fanciful\ngossip about this marriage, and about the three persons who had to\ndo with it.",
        "Take first the principal figure, Thomas Carlyle. His life until\nthat time had been a good deal more than the life of an ordinary\ncountry-man. Many persons represent him as a peasant; but he was\ndescended from the ancient lords of a Scottish manor. There was\nsomething in his eye, and in the dominance of his nature, that\nmade his lordly nature felt. Mr. Froude notes that Carlyle’s hand\nwas very small and unusually well shaped. Nor had his earliest\nappearance as a young man been commonplace, in spite of the fact\nthat his parents were illiterate, so that his mother learned to\nread only after her sons had gone away to Edinburgh, in order that\nshe might be able to enjoy their letters.",
        "At that time in Scotland, as in Puritan New England, in each\nfamily the son who had the most notable “pairts” was sent to the\nuniversity that he might become a clergyman. If there were a\nsecond son, he became an advocate or a doctor of medicine, while\nthe sons of less distinction seldom went beyond the parish school,\nbut settled down as farmers, horse-dealers, or whatever might\nhappen to come their way.",
        "In the case of Thomas Carlyle, nature marked him out for something\nbrilliant, whatever that might be. His quick sensibility, the way\nin which he acquired every sort of learning, his command of logic,\nand, withal, his swift, unerring gift of language, made it certain\nfrom the very first that he must be sent to the university as soon\nas he had finished school, and could afford to go.",
        "At Edinburgh, where he matriculated in his fourteenth year, he\nastonished every one by the enormous extent of his reading, and by\nthe firm hold he kept upon it. One hesitates to credit these so-\ncalled reminiscences which tell how he absorbed mountains of Greek\nand immense quantities of political economy and history and\nsociology and various forms of metaphysics, as every Scotsman is\nbound to do. That he read all night is a common story told of many\na Scottish lad at college. We may believe, however, that Carlyle\nstudied and read as most of his fellow students did, but far\nbeyond them, in extent.",
        "When he had completed about half of his divinity course, he\nassured himself that he was not intended for the life of a\nclergyman. One who reads his mocking sayings, or what seemed to be\na clever string of jeers directed against religion, might well\nthink that Carlyle was throughout his life an atheist, or an\nagnostic. He confessed to Irving that he did not believe in the\nChristian religion, and it was vain to hope that he ever would so\nbelieve.",
        "Moreover, Carlyle had done something which was unusual at that\ntime. He had taught in several local schools; but presently he\ncame back to Edinburgh and openly made literature his profession.\nIt was a daring thing to do; but Carlyle had unbounded confidence\nin himself–the confidence of a giant, striding forth into a\nforest, certain that he can make his way by sheer strength through\nthe tangled meshes and the knotty branches that he knows will meet\nhim and try to beat him back. Furthermore, he knew how to live on\nvery little; he was unmarried; and he felt a certain ardor which\nbeseemed his age and gifts.",
        "Through the kindness of friends, he received some commissions to\nwrite in various books of reference; and in 1824, when he was\ntwenty-nine years of age, he published a translation of Legendre’s\nGeometry. In the same year he published, in the London Magazine,\nhis Life of Schiller, and also his translation of Goethe’s Wilhelm\nMeister. This successful attack upon the London periodicals and\nreviews led to a certain complication with the other two\ncharacters in this story. It takes us to Jane Welsh, and also to\nEdward Irving.",
        "Irving was three years older than Carlyle. The two men were\nfriends, and both of them had been teaching in country schools,\nwhere both of them had come to know Miss Welsh. Irving’s seniority\ngave him a certain prestige with the younger men, and naturally\nwith Miss Welsh. He had won honors at the university, and now, as\nassistant to the famous Dr. Chalmers, he carried his silk robes in\nthe jaunty fashion of one who has just ceased to be an\nundergraduate. While studying, he met Miss Welsh at Haddington,\nand there became her private instructor.",
        "This girl was regarded in her native town as something of a\npersonage. To read what has been written of her, one might suppose\nthat she was almost a miracle of birth and breeding, and of\nintellect as well. As a matter of fact, in the little town of\nHaddington she was simply prima inter pares. Her father was the\nlocal doctor, and while she had a comfortable home, and doubtless\na chaise at her disposal, she was very far from the “opulence\"\nwhich Carlyle, looking up at her from his lowlier surroundings,\nwas accustomed to ascribe to her. She was, no doubt, a very clever\ngirl; and, judging from the portraits taken of her at about this\ntime, she was an exceedingly pretty one, with beautiful eyes and\nan abundance of dark glossy hair.",
        "Even then, however, Miss Welsh had traits which might have made it\ncertain that she would be much more agreeable as a friend than as\na wife. She had become an intellectuelle quite prematurely–at an\nage, in fact, when she might better have been thinking of other\nthings than the inwardness of her soul, or the folly of religious\nbelief.",
        "Even as a young girl, she was beset by a desire to criticize and\nto ridicule almost everything and every one that she encountered.\nIt was only when she met with something that she could not\nunderstand, or some one who could do what she could not, that she\nbecame comparatively humble. Unconsciously, her chief ambition was\nto be herself distinguished, and to marry some one who could be\nmore distinguished still.",
        "When she first met Edward Irving, she looked up to him as her\nsuperior in many ways. He was a striking figure in her small\nworld. He was known in Edinburgh as likely to be a man of mark;\nand, of course, he had had a careful training in many subjects of\nwhich she, as yet, knew very little. Therefore, insensibly, she\nfell into a sort of admiration for Irving–an admiration which\nmight have been transmuted into love. Irving, on his side, was\ntaken by the young girl’s beauty, her vivacity, and the keenness\nof her intellect. That he did not at once become her suitor is\nprobably due to the fact that he had already engaged himself to a\nMiss Martin, of whom not much is known.",
        "It was about this time, however, that Carlyle became acquainted\nwith Miss Welsh. His abundant knowledge, his original and striking\nmanner of commenting on it, his almost gigantic intellectual\npower, came to her as a revelation. Her studies with Irving were\nnow interwoven with her admiration for Carlyle.",
        "Since Irving was a clergyman, and Miss Welsh had not the slightest\nbelief in any form of theology, there was comparatively little\nthat they had in common. On the other hand, when she saw the\nprofundities of Carlyle, she at once half feared, and was half\nfascinated. Let her speak to him on any subject, and he would at\nonce thunder forth some striking truth, or it might be some\npuzzling paradox; but what he said could never fail to interest\nher and to make her think. He had, too, an infinite sense of\nhumor, often whimsical and shot through with sarcasm.",
        "It is no wonder that Miss Welsh was more and more infatuated with\nthe nature of Carlyle. If it was her conscious wish to marry a man\nwhom she could reverence as a master, where should she find him–\nin Irving or in Carlyle?",
        "Irving was a dreamer, a man who, she came to see, was thoroughly\none-sided, and whose interests lay in a different sphere from\nhers. Carlyle, on the other hand, had already reached out beyond\nthe little Scottish capital, and had made his mark in the great\nworld of London, where men like De Quincey and Jeffrey thought it\nworth their while to run a tilt with him. Then, too, there was the\nfascination of his talk, in which Jane Welsh found a perpetual\nsource of interest:",
        "The English have never had an artist, except in poetry; no\nmusician; no painter. Purcell and Hogarth are not exceptions, or\nonly such as confirm the rule.",
        "Is the true Scotchman the peasant and yeoman–chiefly the former?",
        "Every living man is a visible mystery; he walks between two\neternities and two infinitudes. Were we not blind as molea we\nshould value our humanity at infinity, and our rank, influence and\nso forth–the trappings of our humanity–at nothing. Say I am a\nman, and you say all. Whether king or tinker is a mere appendix.",
        "Understanding is to reason as the talent of a beaver–which can\nbuild houses, and uses its tail for a trowel–to the genius of a\nprophet and poet. Reason is all but extinct in this age; it can\nnever be altogether extinguished.",
        "The devil has his elect.",
        "Is anything more wonderful than another, if you consider it\nmaturely? I have seen no men rise from the dead; I have seen some\nthousands rise from nothing. I have not force to fly into the sun,\nbut I have force to lift my hand, which is equally strange.",
        "Is not every thought properly an inspiration? Or how is one thing\nmore inspired than another?",
        "Examine by logic the import of thy life, and of all lives. What is\nit? A making of meal into manure, and of manure into meal. To the\ncui bono there is no answer from logic.",
        "In many ways Jane Welsh found the difference of range between\nCarlyle and Irving. At one time, she asked Irving about some\nGerman works, and he was obliged to send her to Carlyle to solve\nher difficulties. Carlyle knew German almost as well as if he had\nbeen born in Dresden; and the full and almost overflowing way in\nwhich he answered her gave her another impression of his potency.\nThus she weighed the two men who might become her lovers, and\nlittle by little she came to think of Irving as partly shallow and\npartly narrow-minded, while Carlyle loomed up more of a giant than\nbefore.",
        "It is not probable that she was a woman who could love profoundly.\nShe thought too much about herself. She was too critical. She had\ntoo intense an ambition for “showing off.” I can imagine that in\nthe end she made her choice quite coolly. She was flattered by\nCarlyle’s strong preference for her. She was perhaps repelled by\nIrving’s engagement to another woman; yet at the time few persons\nthought that she had chosen well.",
        "Irving had now gone to London, and had become the pastor of the\nCaledonian chapel in Hatton Garden. Within a year, by the\nextraordinary power of his eloquence, which, was in a style\npeculiar to himself, he had transformed an obscure little chapel\ninto one which was crowded by the rich and fashionable. His\ncongregation built for him a handsome edifice on Regent Square,\nand he became the leader of a new cult, which looked to a second\npersonal advent of Christ. He cared nothing for the charges of\nheresy which were brought against him; and when he was deposed his\ncongregation followed him, and developed a new Christian order,\nknown as Irvingism.",
        "Jane Welsh, in her musings, might rightfully have compared the two\nmen and the future which each could give her. Did she marry\nIrving, she was certain of a life of ease in London, and an\nassociation with men and women of fashion and celebrity, among\nwhom she could show herself to be the gifted woman that she was.\nDid she marry Carlyle, she must go with him to a desolate, wind-\nbeaten cottage, far away from any of the things she cared for,\nworking almost as a housemaid, having no company save that of her\nhusband, who was already a dyspeptic, and who was wont to speak of\nfeeling as if a rat were tearing out his stomach.",
        "Who would have said that in going with Carlyle she had made the\nbetter choice? Any one would have said it who knew the three–\nIrving, Carlyle, and Jane Welsh.",
        "She had the penetration to be certain that whatever Irving might\npossess at present, it would be nothing in comparison to what\nCarlyle would have in the coming future. She understood the\nlimitations of Irving, but to her keen mind the genius of Carlyle\nwas unlimited; and she foresaw that, after he had toiled and\nstriven, he would come into his great reward, which she would\nshare. Irving might be the leader of a petty sect, but Carlyle\nwould be a man whose name must become known throughout the world.",
        "And so, in 1826, she had made her choice, and had become the bride\nof the rough-spoken, domineering Scotsman who had to face the\nworld with nothing but his creative brain and his stubborn\nindependence. She had put aside all immediate thought of London\nand its lures; she was going to cast in her lot with Carlyle’s,\nlargely as a matter of calculation, and believing that she had\nmade the better choice.",
        "She was twenty-six and Carlyle was thirty-two when, after a brief\nresidence in Edinburgh, they went down to Craigenputtock. Froude\nhas described this place as the dreariest spot in the British\ndominions:",
        "The nearest cottage is more than a mile from it; the elevation,\nseven hundred feet above the sea, stunts the trees and limits the\ngarden produce; the house is gaunt and hungry-looking. It stands,\nwith the scanty fields attached, as an island in a sea of morass.\nThe landscape is unredeemed by grace or grandeur–mere undulating\nhills of grass and heather, with peat bogs in the hollows between\nthem.",
        "Froude’s grim description has been questioned by some; yet the\nactual pictures that have been drawn of the place in later years\nmake it look bare, desolate, and uninviting. Mrs. Carlyle, who\nowned it as an inheritance from her father, saw the place for the\nfirst time in March, 1828. She settled there in May; but May, in\nthe Scottish hills, is almost as repellent as winter. She herself\nshrank from the adventure which she had proposed. It was her\nhusband’s notion, and her own, that they should live there in\npractical solitude. He was to think and write, and make for\nhimself a beginning of real fame; while she was to hover over him\nand watch his minor comforts.",
        "It seemed to many of their friends that the project was quixotic\nto a degree. Mrs. Carlyle delicate health, her weak chest, and the\nbeginning of a nervous disorder, made them think that she was\nunfit to dwell in so wild and bleak a solitude. They felt, too,\nthat Carlyle was too much absorbed with his own thought to be\ntrusted with the charge of a high-spirited woman.",
        "However, the decision had been made, and the newly married couple\nwent to Craigenputtock, with wagons that carried their household\ngoods and those of Carlyle’s brother, Alexander, who lived in a\ncottage near by. These were the two redeeming features of their\nlonely home–the presence of Alexander Carlyle, and the fact that,\nalthough they had no servants in the ordinary sense, there were\nseveral farmhands and a dairy-maid.",
        "Before long there came a period of trouble, which is easily\nexplained by what has been already said. Carlyle, thinking and\nwriting some of the most beautiful things that he ever thought or\nwrote, could not make allowance for his wife’s high spirit and\nphysical weakness. She, on her side–nervous, fitful, and hard to\nplease–thought herself a slave, the servant of a harsh and brutal\nmaster. She screamed at him when her nerves were too unstrung; and\nthen, with a natural reaction, she called herself “a devil who\ncould never be good enough for him.” But most of her letters were\nharsh and filled with bitterness, and, no doubt, his conduct to\nher was at times no better than her own.",
        "But it was at Craigenputtock that he really did lay fast and firm\nthe road to fame. His wife’s sharp tongue, and the gnawings of his\nown dyspepsia, were lived down with true Scottish grimness. It was\nhere that he wrote some of his most penetrating and sympathetic\nessays, which were published by the leading reviews of England and\nScotland. Here, too, he began to teach his countrymen the value of\nGerman literature.",
        "The most remarkable of his productions was that strange work\nentitled Sartor Resartus (1834), an extraordinary mixture of the\nsublime and the grotesque. The book quivers and shakes with tragic\npathos, with inward agonies, with solemn aspirations, and with\nriotous humor.",
        "In 1834, after six years at Craigenputtock, the Carlyles moved to\nLondon, and took up their home in Cheyne Row, Chelsea, a far from\nfashionable retreat, but one in which the comforts of life could\nbe more readily secured. It was there that Thomas Carlyle wrote\nwhat must seem to us the most vivid of all his books, the History\nof the French Revolution. For this he had read and thought for\nmany years; parts of it he had written in essays, and parts of it\nhe had jotted down in journals. But now it came forth, as some one\nhas said, “a truth clad in hell-fire,” swirling amid clouds and\nflames and mist, a most wonderful picture of the accumulated\nsocial and political falsehoods which preceded the revolution, and\nwhich were swept away by a nemesis that was the righteous judgment\nof God.",
        "Carlyle never wrote so great a book as this. He had reached his\nmiddle style, having passed the clarity of his early writings, and\nnot having yet reached the thunderous, strange-mouthed German\nexpletives which marred his later work. In the French Revolution\nhe bursts forth, here and there, into furious Gallic oaths and\nGargantuan epithets; yet this apocalypse of France seems more true\nthan his hero-worshiping of old Frederick of Prussia, or even of\nEnglish Cromwell.",
        "All these days Thomas Carlyle lived a life which was partly one of\nseclusion and partly one of pleasure. At all times he and his\ndark-haired wife had their own sets, and mingled with their own\nfriends. Jane had no means of discovering just whether she would\nhave been happier with Irving; for Irving died while she was still\ndigging potatoes and complaining of her lot at Craigenputtock.",
        "However this may be, the Carlyles, man and wife, lived an\nexistence that was full of unhappiness and rancor. Jane Carlyle\nbecame an invalid, and sought to allay her nervous sufferings with\nstrong tea and tobacco and morphin. When a nervous woman takes to\nmorphin, it almost always means that she becomes intensely\njealous; and so it was with Jane Carlyle.",
        "A shivering, palpitating, fiercely loyal bit of humanity, she took\nit into her head that her husband was infatuated with Lady\nAshburton, or that Lady Ashburton was infatuated with him. She\ntook to spying on them, and at times, when her nerves were all a\njangle, she would lie back in her armchair and yell with paroxysms\nof anger. On the other hand, Carlyle, eager to enjoy the world,\nsought relief from his household cares, and sometimes stole away\nafter a fashion that was hardly guileless. He would leave false\naddresses at his house, and would dine at other places than he had\nannounced.",
        "In 1866 Jane Carlyle suddenly died; and somehow, then, the\nconscience of Thomas Carlyle became convinced that he had wronged\nthe woman whom he had really loved. His last fifteen years were\nspent in wretchedness and despair. He felt that he had committed\nthe unpardonable sin. He recalled with anguish every moment of\ntheir early life at Craigenputtock–how she had toiled for him,\nand waited upon him, and made herself a slave; and how, later, she\nhad given herself up entirely to him, while he had thoughtlessly\nreceived the sacrifice, and trampled on it as on a bed of flowers.",
        "Of course, in all this he was intensely morbid, and the diary\nwhich he wrote was no more sane and wholesome than the screamings\nwith which his wife had horrified her friends. But when he had\ngrown to be a very old man, he came to feel that this was all a\nsort of penance, and that the selfishness of his past must be\nexpiated in the future. Therefore, he gave his diary to his\nfriend, the historian, Froude, and urged him to publish the\nletters and memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle. Mr. Froude, with an\neye to the reading world, readily did so, furnishing them with\nabundant footnotes, which made Carlyle appear to the world as\nmore or less of a monster.",
        "First, there was set forth the almost continual unhappiness of the\npair. In the second place, by hint, by innuendo, and sometimes by\nexplicit statement, there were given reasons to show why Carlyle\nmade his wife unhappy. Of course, his gnawing dyspepsia, which she\nstrove with all her might to drive away, was one of the first and\ngreatest causes. But again another cause of discontent was stated\nin the implication that Carlyle, in his bursts of temper, actually\nabused his wife. In one passage there is a hint that certain blue\nmarks upon her arm were bruises, the result of blows.",
        "Most remarkable of all these accusations is that which has to do\nwith the relations of Carlyle and Lady Ashburton. There is no\ndoubt that Jane Carlyle disliked this brilliant woman, and came to\nhave dark suspicions concerning her. At first, it was only a sort\nof social jealousy. Lady Ashburton was quite as clever a talker as\nMrs. Carlyle, and she had a prestige which brought her more\nadmiration.",
        "Then, by degrees, as Jane Carlyle’s mind began to wane, she\ntransferred her jealousy to her husband himself. She hated to be\nout-shone, and now, in some misguided fashion, it came into her\nhead that Carlyle had surrendered to Lady Ashburton his own\nattention to his wife, and had fallen in love with her brilliant\nrival.",
        "On one occasion, she declared that Lady Ashburton had thrown\nherself at Carlyle’s feet, but that Carlyle had acted like a man\nof honor, while Lord Ashburton, knowing all the facts, had passed\nthem over, and had retained his friendship with Carlyle.",
        "Now, when Froude came to write My Relations with Carlyle, there\nwere those who were very eager to furnish him with every sort of\ngossip. The greatest source of scandal upon which he drew was a\nwoman named Geraldine Jewsbury, a curious neurotic creature, who\nhad seen much of the late Mrs. Carlyle, but who had an almost\nmorbid love of offensive tattle. Froude describes himself as a\nwitness for six years, at Cheyne Row, “of the enactment of a\ntragedy as stern and real as the story of Oedipus.” According to\nhis own account:",
        "I stood by, consenting to the slow martyrdom of a woman whom I\nhave described as bright and sparkling and tender, and I uttered\nno word of remonstrance. I saw her involved in a perpetual\nblizzard, and did nothing to shelter her.",
        "But it is not upon his own observations that Froude relies for his\nmost sinister evidence against his friend. To him comes Miss\nJewsbury with a lengthy tale to tell. It is well to know what Mrs.\nCarlyle thought of this lady. She wrote:",
        "It is her besetting sin, and her trade of novelist has aggravated\nit–the desire of feeling and producing violent emotions. ...\nGeraldine has one besetting weakness; she is never happy unless\nshe has a grande passion on hand.",
        "There were strange manifestations on the part of Miss Jewsbury\ntoward Mrs. Carlyle. At one time, when Mrs. Carlyle had shown some\npreference for another woman, it led to a wild outburst of what\nMiss Jewsbury herself called “tiger jealousy.” There are many\nother instances of violent emotions in her letters to Mrs.\nCarlyle. They are often highly charged and erotic. It is unusual\nfor a woman of thirty-two to write to a woman friend, who is\nforty-three years of age, in these words, which Miss Jewsbury used\nin writing to Mrs. Carlyle:",
        "You are never out of my thoughts one hour together. I think of you\nmuch more than if you were my lover. I cannot express my feelings,\neven to you–vague, undefined yearnings to be yours in some way.",
        "Mrs. Carlyle was accustomed, in private, to speak of Miss Jewsbury\nas “Miss Gooseberry,” while Carlyle himself said that she was\nsimply “a flimsy tatter of a creature.” But it is on the testimony\nof this one woman, who was so morbid and excitable, that the most\nserious accusations against Carlyle rest. She knew that Froude was\nwriting a volume about Mrs. Carlyle, and she rushed to him, eager\nto furnish any narratives, however strange, improbable, or\nsalacious they might be.",
        "Thus she is the sponsor of the Ashburton story, in which there is\nnothing whatsoever. Some of the letters which Lady Ashburton wrote\nCarlyle have been destroyed, but not before her husband had\nperused them. Another set of letters had never been read by Lord\nAshburton at all, and they are still preserved–friendly,\nharmless, usual letters. Lord Ashburton always invited Carlyle to\nhis house, and there is no reason to think that the Scottish\nphilosopher wronged him.",
        "There is much more to be said about the charge that Mrs. Carlyle\nsuffered from personal abuse; yet when we examine the facts, the\nevidence resolves itself into practically nothing. That, in his\nself-absorption, he allowed her to Sending Completed Page, Please\nWait ... overflowed toward a man who must have been a manly,\nloving lover. She calls him by the name by which he called her–a\nhomely Scottish name.",
        "Goody, Goody, Dear Goody:",
        "You said you would weary, and I do hope in my heart you are\nwearying. It will be so sweet to make it all up to you in kisses\nwhen I return. You will take me and hear all my bits of\nexperiences, and your heart will beat when you find how I have\nlonged to return to you. Darling, dearest, loveliest, the Lord\nbless you! I think of you every hour, every moment. I love you and\nadmire you, like–like anything. Oh, if I was there, I could put\nmy arms so close about your neck, and hush you into the softest\nsleep you have had since I went away. Good night. Dream of me. I\nam ever YOUR OWN GOODY.",
        "It seems most fitting to remember Thomas Carlyle as a man of\nstrength, of honor, and of intellect; and his wife as one who was\nsorely tried, but who came out of her suffering into the arms of\ndeath, purified and calm and worthy to be remembered by her\nhusband’s side.",
        "Victor Hugo, after all criticisms have been made, stands as a\nliterary colossus. He had imaginative power which makes his finest\npassages fairly crash upon the reader’s brain like blasting\nthunderbolts. His novels, even when translated, are read and\nreread by people of every degree of education. There is something\nvast, something almost Titanic, about the grandeur and\ngorgeousness of his fancy. His prose resembles the sonorous blare\nof an immense military band. Readers of English care less for his\npoetry; yet in his verse one can find another phase of his\nintellect. He could write charmingly, in exquisite cadences, poems\nfor lovers and for little children. His gifts were varied, and he\nknew thoroughly the life and thought of his own countrymen; and,\ntherefore, in his later days he was almost deified by them.",
        "At the same time, there were defects in his intellect and\ncharacter which are perceptible in what he wrote, as well as in\nwhat he did. He had the Gallic wit in great measure, but he was\nabsolutely devoid of any sense of humor. This is why, in both his\nprose and his poetry, his most tremendous pages often come\nperilously near to bombast; and this is why, again, as a man, his\nvanity was almost as great as his genius. He had good reason to be\nvain, and yet, if he had possessed a gleam of humor, he would\nnever have allowed his egoism to make him arrogant. As it was, he\nfelt himself exalted above other mortals. Whatever he did or said\nor wrote was right because he did it or said it or wrote it.",
        "This often showed itself in rather whimsical ways. Thus, after he\nhad published the first edition of his novel, The Man Who Laughs,\nan English gentleman called upon him, and, after some courteous\ncompliments, suggested that in subsequent editions the name of an\nEnglish peer who figures in the book should be changed from Tom\nJim-Jack.",
        "“For,” said the Englishman, “Tom Jim-Jack is a name that could not\npossibly belong to an English noble, or, indeed, to any\nEnglishman. The presence of it in your powerful story makes it\nseem to English readers a little grotesque.”",
        "Victor Hugo drew himself up with an air of high disdain.",
        "“Who are you?” asked he.",
        "“I am an Englishman,” was the answer, “and naturally I know what\nnames are possible in English.”",
        "Hugo drew himself up still higher, and on his face there was a\nsmile of utter contempt.",
        "“Yes,” said he. “You are an Englishman; but I–I am Victor Hugo.”",
        "In another book Hugo had spoken of the Scottish bagpipes as\n\"bugpipes.” This gave some offense to his Scottish admirers. A\ngreat many persons told him that the word was “bagpipes,” and not\n\"bugpipes.” But he replied with irritable obstinacy:",
        "“I am Victor Hugo; and if I choose to write it ’bugpipes,’ it IS\n’bugpipes.’ It is anything that I prefer to make it. It is so,\nbecause I call it so!”",
        "So, Victor Hugo became a violent republican, because he did not\nwish France to be an empire or a kingdom, in which an emperor or a\nking would be his superior in rank. He always spoke of Napoleon\nIII as “M. Bonaparte.” He refused to call upon the gentle-mannered\nEmperor of Brazil, because he was an emperor; although Dom Pedro\nexpressed an earnest desire to meet the poet.",
        "When the German army was besieging Paris, Hugo proposed to fight a\nduel with the King of Prussia, and to have the result of it settle\nthe war; “for,” said he, “the King of Prussia is a great king, but\nI am Victor Hugo, the great poet. We are, therefore, equal.”",
        "In spite, however, of his ardent republicanism, he was very fond\nof speaking of his own noble descent. Again and again he styled\nhimself “a peer of France;” and he and his family made frequent\nallusions to the knights and bishops and counselors of state with\nwhom he claimed an ancestral relation. This was more than\ninconsistent. It was somewhat ludicrous; because Victor Hugo’s\nancestry was by no means noble. The Hugos of the fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries were not in any way related to the poet’s\nfamily, which was eminently honest and respectable, but by no\nmeans one of distinction. His grandfather was a carpenter. One of\nhis aunts was the wife of a baker, another of a barber, while the\nthird earned her living as a provincial dressmaker.",
        "If the poet had been less vain and more sincerely democratic, he\nwould have been proud to think that he sprang from good, sound,\nsturdy stock, and would have laughed at titles. As it was, he\njeered at all pretensions of rank in other men, while he claimed\nfor himself distinctions that were not really his. His father was\na soldier who rose from the ranks until, under Napoleon, he\nreached the grade of general. His mother was the daughter of a\nship owner in Nantes.",
        "Victor Hugo was born in February, 1802, during the Napoleonic\nwars, and his early years were spent among the camps and within\nthe sound of the cannon-thunder. It was fitting that he should\nhave been born and reared in an age of upheaval, revolt, and\nbattle. He was essentially the laureate of revolt; and in some of\nhis novels–as in Ninety-Three–the drum and the trumpet roll and\nring through every chapter.",
        "The present paper has, of course, nothing to do with Hugo’s public\nlife; yet it is necessary to remember the complicated nature of\nthe man–all his power, all his sweetness of disposition, and\nlikewise all his vanity and his eccentricities. We must remember,\nalso, that he was French, so that his story may be interpreted in\nthe light of the French character.",
        "At the age of fifteen he was domiciled in Paris, and though still\na schoolboy and destined for the study of law, he dreamed only of\npoetry and of literature. He received honorable mention from the\nFrench Academy in 1817, and in the following year took prizes in a\npoetical competition. At seventeen he began the publication of a\nliterary journal, which survived until 1821. His astonishing\nenergy became evident in the many publications which he put forth\nin these boyish days. He began to become known. Although poetry,\nthen as now, was not very profitable even when it was admired, one\nof his slender volumes brought him the sum of seven hundred\nfrancs, which seemed to him not only a fortune in itself, but the\nforerunner of still greater prosperity.",
        "It was at this time, while still only twenty years of age, that he\nmet a young girl of eighteen with whom he fell rather\ntempestuously in love. Her name was Adele Foucher, and she was the\ndaughter of a clerk in the War Office. When one is very young and\nalso a poet, it takes very little to feed the flame of passion.\nVictor Hugo was often a guest at the apartments of M. Foucher,\nwhere he was received by that gentleman and his family. French\netiquette, of course, forbade any direct communication between the\nvisitor and Adele. She was still a very young girl, and was\nsupposed to take no share in the conversation. Therefore, while\nthe others talked, she sat demurely by the fireside and sewed.",
        "Her dark eyes and abundant hair, her grace of manner, and the\npicture which she made as the firelight played about her, kindled\na flame in the susceptible heart of Victor Hugo. Though he could\nnot speak to her, he at least could look at her; and, before long,\nhis share in the conversation was very slight. This was set down,\nat first, to his absent-mindedness; but looks can be as eloquent\nas spoken words. Mme. Foucher, with a woman’s keen intelligence,\nnoted the adoring gaze of Victor Hugo as he silently watched her\ndaughter. The young Adele herself was no less intuitive than her\nmother. It was very well understood, in the course of a few\nmonths, that Victor Hugo was in love with Adele Foucher.",
        "Her father and mother took counsel about the matter, and Hugo\nhimself, in a burst of lyrical eloquence, confessed that he adored\nAdele and wished to marry her. Her parents naturally objected. The\ngirl was but a child. She had no dowry, nor had Victor Hugo any\nsettled income. They were not to think of marriage. But when did a\ncommon-sense decision, such as this, ever separate a man and a\nwoman who have felt the thrill of first love! Victor Hugo was\ninsistent. With his supreme self-confidence, he declared that he\nwas bound to be successful, and that in a very short time he would\nbe illustrious. Adele, on her side, created “an atmosphere” at\nhome by weeping frequently, and by going about with hollow eyes\nand wistful looks.",
        "The Foucher family removed from Paris to a country town. Victor\nHugo immediately followed them. Fortunately for him, his poems had\nattracted the attention of Louis XVIII, who was flattered by some\nof the verses. He sent Hugo five hundred francs for an ode, and\nsoon afterward settled upon him a pension of a thousand francs.\nHere at least was an income–a very small one, to be sure, but\nstill an income. Perhaps Adele’s father was impressed not so much\nby the actual money as by the evidence of the royal favor. At any\nrate, he withdrew his opposition, and the two young people were\nmarried in October, 1822–both of them being under age, unformed,\nand immature.",
        "Their story is another warning against too early marriage. It is\ntrue that they lived together until Mme. Hugo’s death–a married\nlife of forty-six years–yet their story presents phases which\nwould have made this impossible had they not been French.",
        "For a time, Hugo devoted all his energies to work. The record of\nhis steady upward progress is a part of the history of literature,\nand need not be repeated here. The poet and his wife were soon\nable to leave the latter’s family abode, and to set up their own\nhousehold god in a home which was their own. Around them there\nwere gathered, in a sort of salon, all the best-known writers of\nthe day–dramatists, critics, poets, and romancers. The Hugos knew\neverybody.",
        "Unfortunately, one of their visitors cast into their new life a\ndrop of corroding bitterness. This intruder was Charles Augustin\nSainte-Beuve, a man two years younger than Victor Hugo, and one\nwho blended learning, imagination, and a gift of critical\nanalysis. Sainte-Beuve is to-day best remembered as a critic, and\nhe was perhaps the greatest critic ever known in France. But in\n1830 he was a slender, insinuating youth who cultivated a gift for\nsensuous and somewhat morbid poetry.",
        "He had won Victor Hugo’s friendship by writing an enthusiastic\nnotice of Hugo’s dramatic works. Hugo, in turn, styled Sainte-\nBeuve “an eagle,” “a blazing star,” and paid him other compliments\nno less gorgeous and Hugoesque. But in truth, if Sainte-Beuve\nfrequented the Hugo salon, it was less because of his admiration\nfor the poet than from his desire to win the love of the poet’s\nwife.",
        "It is quite impossible to say how far he attracted the serious\nattention of Adele Hugo. Sainte-Beuve represents a curious type,\nwhich is far more common in France and Italy than in the countries\nof the north. Human nature is not very different in cultivated\ncircles anywhere. Man loves, and seeks to win the object of his\nlove; or, as the old English proverb has it:",
        "But only in the Latin countries do men who have tried make their\nattempts public, and seek to produce an impression that they have\nbeen successful, and that the woman has not denied. This sort of\nman, in English-speaking lands, is set down simply as a cad, and\nis excluded from people’s houses; but in some other countries the\nthing is regarded with a certain amount of toleration. We see it\nin the two books written respectively by Alfred de Musset and\nGeorge Sand. We have seen it still later in our own times, in that\nstrange and half-repulsive story in which the Italian novelist and\npoet, Gabriele d’Annunzio, under a very thin disguise, revealed\nhis relations with the famous actress, Eleanora Duse. Anglo-Saxons\nthrust such books aside with a feeling of disgust for the man who\ncould so betray a sacred confidence and perhaps exaggerate a\nsimple indiscretion into actual guilt. But it is not so in France\nand Italy. And this is precisely what Sainte-Beuve attempted.",
        "Dr. George McLean Harper, in his lately published study of Sainte-\nBeuve, has summed the matter up admirably, in speaking of The Book\nof Love:",
        "He had the vein of emotional self-disclosure, the vein of romantic\nor sentimental confession. This last was not a rich lode, and so\nhe was at pains to charge it secretly with ore which he exhumed\ngloatingly, but which was really base metal. The impulse that led\nhim along this false route was partly ambition, partly sensuality.\nMany a worse man would have been restrained by self-respect and\ngood taste. And no man with a sense of honor would have permitted\nThe Book of Love to see the light–a small collection of verses\nrecording his passion for Mme. Hugo, and designed to implicate\nher.",
        "He left two hundred and five printed copies of this book to be\ndistributed after his death. A virulent enemy of Sainte-Beuve was\nnot too expressive when he declared that its purpose was “to leave\non the life of this woman the gleaming and slimy trace which the\npassage of a snail leaves on a rose.” Abominable in either case,\nwhether or not the implication was unfounded, Sainte-Beuve’s\nnumerous innuendoes in regard to Mme. Hugo are an indelible stain\non his memory, and his infamy not only cost him his most precious\nfriendships, but crippled him in every high endeavor.",
        "How monstrous was this violation of both friendship and love may\nbe seen in the following quotation from his writings:",
        "In that inevitable hour, when the gloomy tempest and the jealous\ngulf shall roll over our heads, a sealed bottle, belched forth\nfrom the abyss, will render immortal our two names, their close\nalliance, and our double memory aspiring after union.",
        "Whether or not Mme. Hugo’s relations with Sainte-Beuve justified\nthe latter even in thinking such thoughts as these, one need not\ninquire too minutely. Evidently, though, Victor Hugo could no\nlonger be the friend of the man who almost openly boasted that he\nhad dishonored him. There exist some sharp letters which passed\nbetween Hugo and Sainte-Beuve. Their intimacy was ended.",
        "But there was something more serious than this. Sainte-Beuve had\nin fact succeeded in leaving a taint upon the name of Victor\nHugo’s wife. That Hugo did not repudiate her makes it fairly plain\nthat she was innocent; yet a high-spirited, sensitive soul like\nHugo’s could never forget that in the world’s eye she was\ncompromised. The two still lived together as before; but now the\npoet felt himself released from the strict obligations of the\nmarriage-bond.",
        "It may perhaps be doubted whether he would in any case have\nremained faithful all his life. He was, as Mr. H.W. Wack well\nsays, “a man of powerful sensations, physically as well as\nmentally. Hugo pursued every opportunity for new work, new\nsensations, fresh emotion. He desired to absorb as much on life’s\neager forward way as his great nature craved. His range in all\nthings–mental, physical, and spiritual–was so far beyond the\nordinary that the gage of average cannot be applied to him. The\ncavil of the moralist did not disturb him.”",
        "Hence, it is not improbable that Victor Hugo might have broken\nthrough the bonds of marital fidelity, even had Sainte-Beuve never\nwritten his abnormal poems; but certainly these poems hastened a\nresult which may or may not have been otherwise inevitable. Hugo\nno longer turned wholly to the dark-haired, dark-eyed Adele as\nsumming up for him the whole of womanhood. A veil was drawn, as it\nwere, from before his eyes, and he looked on other women and found\nthem beautiful.",
        "It was in 1833, soon after Hugo’s play “Lucrece Borgia” had been\naccepted for production, that a lady called one morning at Hugo’s\nhouse in the Place Royale. She was then between twenty and thirty\nyears of age, slight of figure, winsome in her bearing, and one\nwho knew the arts which appeal to men. For she was no\ninexperienced ingenue. The name upon her visiting-card was “Mme.\nDrouet\"; and by this name she had been known in Paris as a clever\nand somewhat gifted actress. Theophile Gautier, whose cult was the\nworship of physical beauty, wrote in almost lyric prose of her\nseductive charm.",
        "At nineteen, after she had been cast upon the world, dowered with\nthat terrible combination, poverty and beauty, she had lived\nopenly with a sculptor named Pradier. This has a certain\nimportance in the history of French art. Pradier had received a\ncommission to execute a statue representing Strasburg–the statue\nwhich stands to-day in the Place de la Concorde, and which\npatriotic Frenchmen and Frenchwomen drape in mourning and half\nbury in immortelles, in memory of that city of Alsace which so\nlong was French, but which to-day is German–one of Germany’s\ngreat prizes taken in the war of 1870.",
        "Five years before her meeting with Hugo, Pradier had rather\nbrutally severed his connection with her, and she had accepted the\nprotection of a Russian nobleman. At this time she was known by\nher real name–Julienne Josephine Gauvin; but having gone upon the\nstage, she assumed the appellation by which she was thereafter\nknown, that of Juliette Drouet.",
        "Her visit to Hugo was for the purpose of asking him to secure for\nher a part in his forth-coming play. The dramatist was willing,\nbut unfortunately all the major characters had been provided for,\nand he was able to offer her only the minor one of the Princesse\nNegroni. The charming deference with which she accepted the\noffered part attracted Hugo’s attention. Such amiability is very\nrare in actresses who have had engagements at the best theaters.\nHe resolved to see her again; and he did so, time after time,\nuntil he was thoroughly captivated by her.",
        "She knew her value, and as yet was by no means infatuated with\nhim. At first he was to her simply a means of getting on in her\nprofession–simply another influential acquaintance. Yet she\nbrought to bear upon him the arts at her command, her beauty and\nher sympathy, and, last of all, her passionate abandonment.",
        "Hugo was overwhelmed by her. He found that she was in debt, and he\nmanaged to see that her debts were paid. He secured her other\nengagements at the theater, though she was less successful as an\nactress after she knew him. There came, for a time, a short break\nin their relations; for, partly out of need, she returned to her\nRussian nobleman, or at least admitted him to a menage a trois.\nHugo underwent for a second time a great disillusionment.\nNevertheless, he was not too proud to return to her and to beg her\nnot to be unfaithful any more. Touched by his tears, and perhaps\nforeseeing his future fame, she gave her promise, and she kept it\nuntil her death, nearly half a century later.",
        "Perhaps because she had deceived him once, Hugo never completely\nlost his prudence in his association with her. He was by no means\nlavish with money, and he installed her in a rather simple\napartment only a short distance from his own home. He gave her an\nallowance that was relatively small, though later he provided for\nher amply in his will. But it was to her that he brought all his\nconfidences, to her he entrusted all his interests. She became to\nhim, thenceforth, much more than she appeared to the world at\nlarge; for she was his friend, and, as he said, his inspiration.",
        "The fact of their intimate connection became gradually known\nthrough Paris. It was known even to Mme. Hugo; but she,\nremembering the affair of Sainte-Beuve, or knowing how difficult\nit is to check the will of a man like Hugo, made no sign, and even\nreceived Juliette Drouet in her own house and visited her in turn.\nWhen the poet’s sons grew up to manhood, they, too, spent many\nhours with their father in the little salon of the former actress.\nIt was a strange and, to an Anglo-Saxon mind, an almost impossible\nposition; yet France forgives much to genius, and in time no one\nthought of commenting on Hugo’s manner of life.",
        "In 1851, when Napoleon III seized upon the government, and when\nHugo was in danger of arrest, she assisted him to escape in\ndisguise, and with a forged passport, across the Belgian frontier.\nDuring his long exile in Guernsey she lived in the same close\nrelationship to him and to his family. Mme. Hugo died in 1868,\nhaving known for thirty-three years that she was only second in\nher husband’s thoughts. Was she doing penance, or was she merely\naccepting the inevitable? In any case, her position was most\npathetic, though she uttered no complaint.",
        "A very curious and poignant picture of her just before her death\nhas been given by the pen of a visitor in Guernsey. He had met\nHugo and his sons; he had seen the great novelist eating enormous\nslices of roast beef and drinking great goblets of red wine at\ndinner, and he had also watched him early each morning, divested\nof all his clothing and splashing about in a bath-tub on the top\nof his house, in view of all the town. One evening he called and\nfound only Mme. Hugo. She was reclining on a couch, and was\nevidently suffering great pain. Surprised, he asked where were her\nhusband and her sons.",
        "“Oh,” she replied, “they’ve all gone to Mme. Drouet’s to spend the\nevening and enjoy themselves. Go also; you’ll not find it amusing\nhere.”",
        "One ponders over this sad scene with conflicting thoughts. Was\nthere really any truth in the story at which Sainte-Beuve more\nthan hinted? If so, Adele Hugo was more than punished. The other\nwoman had sinned far more; and yet she had never been Hugo’s wife;\nand hence perhaps it was right that she should suffer less. Suffer\nshe did; for after her devotion to Hugo had become sincere and\ndeep, he betrayed her confidence by an intrigue with a girl who is\nspoken of as “Claire.” The knowledge of it caused her infinite\nanguish, but it all came to an end; and she lived past her\neightieth year, long after the death of Mme. Hugo. She died only a\nshort time before the poet himself was laid to rest in Paris with\nmagnificent obsequies which an emperor might have envied. In her\nold age, Juliette Drouet became very white and very wan; yet she\nnever quite lost the charm with which, as a girl, she had won the\nheart of Hugo.",
        "The story has many aspects. One may see in it a retribution, or\none may see in it only the cruelty of life. Perhaps it is best\nregarded simply as a chapter in the strange life-histories of men\nof genius.",
        "To the student of feminine psychology there is no more curious and\ncomplex problem than the one that meets us in the life of the\ngifted French writer best known to the world as George Sand.",
        "To analyze this woman simply as a writer would in itself be a\nlong, difficult task. She wrote voluminously, with a fluid rather\nthan a fluent pen. She scandalized her contemporaries by her\ntheories, and by the way in which she applied them in her novels.\nHer fiction made her, in the history of French literature, second\nonly to Victor Hugo. She might even challenge Hugo, because where\nhe depicts strange and monstrous figures, exaggerated beyond the\nlimits of actual life, George Sand portrays living men and women,\nwhose instincts and desires she understands, and whom she makes us\nsee precisely as if we were admitted to their intimacy.",
        "But George Sand puzzles us most by peculiarities which it is\ndifficult for us to reconcile. She seemed to have no sense of\nchastity whatever; yet, on the other hand, she was not grossly\nsensual. She possessed the maternal instinct to a high degree, and\nliked better to be a mother than a mistress to the men whose love\nshe sought. For she did seek men’s love, frankly and shamelessly,\nonly to tire of it. In many cases she seems to have been swayed by\nvanity, and by a love of conquest, rather than by passion. She had\nalso a spiritual, imaginative side to her nature, and she could be\na far better comrade than anything more intimate.",
        "The name given to this strange genius at birth was Amantine Lucile\nAurore Dupin. The circumstances of her ancestry and birth were\nquite unusual. Her father was a lieutenant in the French army. His\ngrandmother had been the natural daughter of Marshal Saxe, who was\nhimself the illegitimate son of Augustus the Strong of Poland and\nof the bewitching Countess of Konigsmarck. This was a curious\npedigree. It meant strength of character, eroticism, stubbornness,\nimagination, courage, and recklessness.",
        "Her father complicated the matter by marrying suddenly a Parisian\nof the lower classes, a bird-fancier named Sophie Delaborde. His\ndaughter, who was born in 1804, used afterward to boast that on\none side she was sprung from kings and nobles, while on the other\nshe was a daughter of the people, able, therefore, to understand\nthe sentiments of the aristocracy and of the children of the soil,\nor even of the gutter.",
        "She was fond of telling, also, of the omen which attended on her\nbirth. Her father and mother were at a country dance in the house\nof a fellow officer of Dupin’s. Suddenly Mme. Dupin left the room.\nNothing was thought of this, and the dance went on. In less than\nan hour, Dupin was called aside and told that his wife had just\ngiven birth to a child. It was the child’s aunt who brought the\nnews, with the joyous comment:",
        "“She will be lucky, for she was born among the roses and to the\nsound of music.”",
        "This was at the time of the Napoleonic wars. Lieutenant Dupin was\non the staff of Prince Murat, and little Aurore, as she was\ncalled, at the age of three accompanied the army, as did her\nmother. The child was adopted by one of those hard-fighting,\nveteran regiments. The rough old sergeants nursed her and petted\nher. Even the prince took notice of her; and to please him she\nwore the green uniform of a hussar.",
        "But all this soon passed, and she was presently sent to live with\nher grandmother at the estate now intimately associated with her\nname–Nohant, in the valley of the Indre, in the midst of a rich\ncountry, a love for which she then drank in so deeply that nothing\nin her later life could lessen it. She was always the friend of\nthe peasant and of the country-folk in general.",
        "At Nohant she was given over to her grand-mother, to be reared in\na strangely desultory sort of fashion, doing and reading and\nstudying those things which could best develop her native gifts.\nHer father had great influence over her, teaching her a thousand\nthings without seeming to teach her anything. Of him George Sand\nherself has written:",
        "Character is a matter of heredity. If any one desires to know me,\nhe must know my father.",
        "Her father, however, was killed by a fall from a horse; and then\nthe child grew up almost without any formal education. A tutor,\nwho also managed the estate; believed with Rousseau that the young\nshould be reared according to their own preferences. Therefore,\nAurore read poems and childish stories; she gained a smattering of\nLatin, and she was devoted to music and the elements of natural\nscience. For the rest of the time she rambled with the country\nchildren, learned their games, and became a sort of leader in\neverything they did.",
        "Her only sorrow was the fact that her mother was excluded from\nNohant. The aristocratic old grandmother would not allow under her\nroof her son’s low-born wife; but she was devoted to her little\ngrandchild. The girl showed a wonderful degree of sensibility.",
        "This life was adapted to her nature. She fed her imagination in a\nperfectly healthy fashion; and, living so much out of doors, she\nacquired that sound physique which she retained all through her\nlife.",
        "When she was thirteen, her grandmother sent the girl to a convent\nschool in Paris. One might suppose that the sudden change from the\nopen woods and fields to the primness of a religious home would\nhave been a great shock to her, and that with her disposition she\nmight have broken out into wild ways that would have shocked the\nnuns. But, here, as elsewhere, she showed her wonderful\nadaptability. It even seemed as if she were likely to become what\nthe French call a devote. She gave herself up to mythical\nthoughts, and expressed a desire of taking the veil. Her\nconfessor, however, was a keen student of human nature, and he\nperceived that she was too young to decide upon the renunciation\nof earthly things. Moreover, her grandmother, who had no intention\nthat Aurore should become a nun, hastened to Paris and carried her\nback to Nohant.",
        "The girl was now sixteen, and her complicated nature began to make\nitself apparent. There was no one to control her, because her\ngrandmother was confined to her own room. And so Aurore Dupin, now\nin superb health, rushed into every sort of diversion with all the\nzest of youth. She read voraciously–religion, poetry, philosophy.\nShe was an excellent musician, playing the piano and the harp.\nOnce, in a spirit of unconscious egotism, she wrote to her\nconfessor:",
        "Do you think that my philosophical studies are compatible with\nChristian humility?",
        "The shrewd ecclesiastic answered, with a touch of wholesome irony:",
        "I doubt, my daughter, whether your philosophical studies are\nprofound enough to warrant intellectual pride.",
        "This stung the girl, and led her to think a little less of her own\nabilities; but perhaps it made her books distasteful to her. For a\nwhile she seems to have almost forgotten her sex. She began to\ndress as a boy, and took to smoking large quantities of tobacco.\nHer natural brother, who was an officer in the army, came down to\nNohant and taught her to ride–to ride like a boy, seated astride.\nShe went about without any chaperon, and flirted with the young\nmen of the neighborhood. The prim manners of the place made her\nsubject to a certain amount of scandal, and the village priest\nchided her in language that was far from tactful. In return she\nrefused any longer to attend his church.",
        "Thus she was living when her grandmother died, in 1821, leaving to\nAurore her entire fortune of five hundred thousand francs. As the\ngirl was still but seventeen, she was placed under the\nguardianship of the nearest relative on her father’s side–a\ngentleman of rank. When the will was read, Aurore’s mother made a\nviolent protest, and caused a most unpleasant scene.",
        "“I am the natural guardian of my child,” she cried. “No one can\ntake away my rights!”",
        "The young girl well understood that this was really the parting of\nthe ways. If she turned toward her uncle, she would be forever\nclassed among the aristocracy. If she chose her mother, who,\nthough married, was essentially a grisette, then she must live\nwith grisettes, and find her friends among the friends who visited\nher mother. She could not belong to both worlds. She must decide\nonce for all whether she would be a woman of rank or a woman\nentirely separated from the circle that had been her father’s.",
        "One must respect the girl for making the choice she did.\nUnderstanding the situation absolutely, she chose her mother; and\nperhaps one would not have had her do otherwise. Yet in the long\nrun it was bound to be a mistake. Aurore was clever, refined, well\nread, and had had the training of a fashionable convent school.\nThe mother was ignorant and coarse, as was inevitable, with one\nwho before her marriage had been half shop-girl and half\ncourtesan. The two could not live long together, and hence it was\nnot unnatural that Aurore Dupin should marry, to enter upon a new\ncareer.",
        "Her fortune was a fairly large one for the times, and yet not\nlarge enough to attract men who were quite her equals. Presently,\nhowever, it brought to her a sort of country squire, named Casimir\nDudevant. He was the illegitimate son of the Baron Dudevant. He\nhad been in the army, and had studied law; but he possessed no\nintellectual tastes. He was outwardly eligible; but he was of a\ncoarse type–a man who, with passing years, would be likely to\ntake to drink and vicious amusements, and in serious life cared\nonly for his cattle, his horses, and his hunting. He had, however,\na sort of jollity about him which appealed to this girl of\neighteen; and so a marriage was arranged. Aurore Dupin became his\nwife in 1822, and he secured the control of her fortune.",
        "The first few years after her marriage were not unhappy. She had a\nson, Maurice Dudevant, and a daughter, Solange, and she loved them\nboth. But it was impossible that she should continue vegetating\nmentally upon a farm with a husband who was a fool, a drunkard,\nand a miser. He deteriorated; his wife grew more and more clever.\nDudevant resented this. It made him uncomfortable. Other persons\nspoke of her talk as brilliant. He bluntly told her that it was\nsilly, and that she must stop it. When she did not stop it, he\nboxed her ears. This caused a breach between the pair which was\nnever healed. Dudevant drank more and more heavily, and jeered at\nhis wife because she was “always looking for noon at fourteen\no’clock.” He had always flirted with the country girls; but now he\nopenly consorted with his wife’s chambermaid.",
        "Mme. Dudevant, on her side, would have nothing more to do with\nthis rustic rake. She formed what she called a platonic\nfriendship–and it was really so–with a certain M. de Seze, who\nwas advocate-general at Bordeaux. With him this clever woman could\ntalk without being called silly, and he took sincere pleasure in\nher company. He might, in fact, have gone much further, had not\nboth of them been in an impossible situation.",
        "Aurore Dudevant really believed that she was swayed by a pure and\nmystic passion. De Seze, on the other hand, believed this mystic\npassion to be genuine love. Coming to visit her at Nohant, he was\nrevolted by the clownish husband with whom she lived. It gave him\nan esthetic shock to see that she had borne children to this boor.\nTherefore he shrank back from her, and in time their relation\nfaded into nothingness.",
        "It happened, soon after, that she found a packet in her husband’s\ndesk, marked “Not to be opened until after my death.” She wrote of\nthis in her correspondence:",
        "I had not the patience to wait till widowhood. No one can be sure\nof surviving anybody. I assumed that my husband had died, and I\nwas very glad to learn what he thought of me while he was alive.\nSince the package was addressed to me, it was not dishonorable for\nme to open it.",
        "And so she opened it. It proved to be his will, but containing, as\na preamble, his curses on her, expressions of contempt, and all\nthe vulgar outpouring of an evil temper and angry passion. She\nwent to her husband as he was opening a bottle, and flung the\ndocument upon the table. He cowered at her glance, at her\nfirmness, and at her cold hatred. He grumbled and argued and\nentreated; but all that his wife would say in answer was:",
        "“I must have an allowance. I am going to Paris, and my children\nare to remain here.”",
        "At last he yielded, and she went at once to Paris, taking her\ndaughter with her, and having the promise of fifteen hundred\nfrancs a year out of the half-million that was hers by right.",
        "In Paris she developed into a thorough-paced Bohemian. She tried\nto make a living in sundry hopeless ways, and at last she took to\nliterature. She was living in a garret, with little to eat, and\nsometimes without a fire in winter. She had some friends who\nhelped her as well as they could, but though she was attached to\nthe Figaro, her earnings for the first month amounted to only\nfifteen francs.",
        "Nevertheless, she would not despair. The editors and publishers\nmight turn the cold shoulder to her, but she would not give up her\nambitions. She went down into the Latin Quarter, and there shook\noff the proprieties of life. She assumed the garb of a man, and\nwith her quick perception she came to know the left bank of the\nSeine just as she had known the country-side at Nohant or the\nlittle world at her convent school. She never expected again to\nsee any woman of her own rank in life. Her mother’s influence\nbecame strong in her. She wrote:",
        "The proprieties are the guiding principle of people without soul\nand virtue. The good opinion of the world is a prostitute who\ngives herself to the highest bidder.",
        "She still pursued her trade of journalism, calling herself a\n\"newspaper mechanic,” sitting all day in the office of the Figaro\nand writing whatever was demanded, while at night she would prowl\nin the streets haunting the cafes, continuing to dress like a man,\ndrinking sour wine, and smoking cheap cigars.",
        "One of her companions in this sort of hand-to-mouth journalism was\na young student and writer named Jules Sandeau, a man seven years\nyounger than his comrade. He was at that time as indigent as she,\nand their hardships, shared in common, brought them very close\ntogether. He was clever, boyish, and sensitive, and it was not\nlong before he had fallen at her feet and kissed her knees,\nbegging that she would requite the love he felt for her. According\nto herself, she resisted him for six months, and then at last she\nyielded. The two made their home together, and for a while were\nwonderfully happy. Their work and their diversions they enjoyed in\ncommon, and now for the first time she experienced emotions which\nin all probability she had never known before.",
        "Probably not very much importance is to be given to the earlier\nflirtations of George Sand, though she herself never tried to stop\nthe mouth of scandal. Even before she left her husband, she was\ncredited with having four lovers; but all she said, when the\nreport was brought to her, was this: “Four lovers are none too\nmany for one with such lively passions as mine.”",
        "This very frankness makes it likely that she enjoyed shocking her\nprim neighbors at Nohant. But if she only played at love-making\nthen, she now gave herself up to it with entire abandonment,\nintoxicated, fascinated, satisfied. She herself wrote:",
        "How I wish I could impart to you this sense of the intensity and\njoyousness of life that I have in my veins. To live! How sweet it\nis, and how good, in spite of annoyances, husbands, debts,\nrelations, scandal-mongers, sufferings, and irritations! To live!\nIt is intoxicating! To love, and to be loved! It is happiness! It\nis heaven!",
        "In collaboration with Jules Sandeau, she wrote a novel called Rose\net Blanche. The two lovers were uncertain what name to place upon\nthe title-page, but finally they hit upon the pseudonym of Jules\nSand. The book succeeded; but thereafter each of them wrote\nseparately, Jules Sandeau using his own name, and Mme. Dudevant\nstyling herself George Sand, a name by which she was to be\nillustrious ever after.",
        "As a novelist, she had found her real vocation. She was not yet\nwell known, but she was on the verge of fame. As soon as she had\nwritten Indiana and Valentine, George Sand had secured a place in\nthe world of letters. The magazine which still exists as the Revue\ndes Deux Mondes gave her a retaining fee of four thousand francs a\nyear, and many other publications begged her to write serial\nstories for them.",
        "The vein which ran through all her stories was new and piquant. As\nwas said of her:",
        "In George Sand, whenever a lady wishes to change her lover, God is\nalways there to make the transfer easy.",
        "In other words, she preached free love in the name of religion.\nThis was not a new doctrine with her. After the first break with\nher husband, she had made up her mind about certain matters, and\nwrote:",
        "One is no more justified in claiming the ownership of a soul than\nin claiming the ownership of a slave.",
        "According to her, the ties between a man and a woman are sacred\nonly when they are sanctified by love; and she distinguished\nbetween love and passion in this epigram:",
        "Love seeks to give, while passion seeks to take.",
        "At this time, George Sand was in her twenty-seventh year. She was\nnot beautiful, though there was something about her which\nattracted observation. Of middle height, she was fairly slender.\nHer eyes were somewhat projecting, and her mouth was almost sullen\nwhen in repose. Her manners were peculiar, combining boldness with\ntimidity. Her address was almost as familiar as a man’s, so that\nit was easy to be acquainted with her; yet a certain haughtiness\nand a touch of aristocratic pride made it plain that she had drawn\na line which none must pass without her wish. When she was deeply\nstirred, however, she burst forth into an extraordinary vivacity,\nshowing a nature richly endowed and eager to yield its treasures.",
        "The existence which she now led was a curious one. She still\nvisited her husband at Nohant, so that she might see her son, and\nsometimes, when M. Dudevant came to town, he called upon her in\nthe apartments which she shared with Jules Sandeau. He had\naccepted the situation, and with his crudeness and lack of feeling\nhe seemed to think it, if not natural, at least diverting. At any\nrate, so long as he could retain her half-million francs, he was\nnot the man to make trouble about his former wife’s arrangements.",
        "Meanwhile, there began to be perceptible the very slightest rift\nwithin the lute of her romance. Was her love for Sandeau really\nlove, or was it only passion? In his absence, at any rate, the old\nobsession still continued. Here we see, first of all, intense\npleasure shading off into a sort of maternal fondness. She sends\nSandeau adoring letters. She is afraid that his delicate appetite\nis not properly satisfied.",
        "Yet, again, there are times when she feels that he is irritating\nand ill. Those who knew them said that her nature was too\npassionate and her love was too exacting for him. One of her\nletters seems to make this plain. She writes that she feels\nuneasy, and even frightfully remorseful, at seeing Sandeau “pine\naway.” She knows, she avows, that she is killing him, that her\ncaresses are a poison, and her love a consuming fire.",
        "It is an appalling thought, and Jules will not understand it. He\nlaughs at it; and when, in the midst of his transports of delight,\nthe idea comes to me and makes my blood run cold, he tells me that\nhere is the death that he would like to die. At such moments he\npromises whatever I make him promise.",
        "This letter throws a clear light upon the nature of George Sand’s\ntemperament. It will be found all through her career, not only\nthat she sought to inspire passion, but that she strove to gratify\nit after fashions of her own. One little passage from a\ndescription of her written by the younger Dumas will perhaps make\nthis phase of her character more intelligible, without going\nfurther than is strictly necessary:",
        "Mme. Sand has little hands without any bones, soft and plump. She\nis by destiny a woman of excessive curiosity, always disappointed,\nalways deceived in her incessant investigation, but she is not\nfundamentally ardent. In vain would she like to be so, but she\ndoes not find it possible. Her physical nature utterly refuses.",
        "The reader will find in all that has now been said the true\nexplanation of George Sand. Abounding with life, but incapable of\nlong stretches of ardent love, she became a woman who sought\nconquests everywhere without giving in return more than her\ntemperament made it possible for her to do. She loved Sandeau as\nmuch as she ever loved any man; and yet she left him with a sense\nthat she had never become wholly his. Perhaps this is the reason\nwhy their romance came to an end abruptly, and not altogether\nfittingly.",
        "She had been spending a short time at Nohant, and came to Paris\nwithout announcement. She intended to surprise her lover, and she\nsurely did so. She found him in the apartment that had been\ntheirs, with his arms about an attractive laundry-girl. Thus\nclosed what was probably the only true romance in the life of\nGeorge Sand. Afterward she had many lovers, but to no one did she\nso nearly become a true mate.",
        "As it was, she ended her association with Sandeau, and each\npursued a separate path to fame. Sandeau afterward became a well-\nknown novelist and dramatist. He was, in fact, the first writer of\nfiction who was admitted to the French Academy. The woman to whom\nhe had been unfaithful became greater still, because her fame was\nnot only national, but cosmopolitan.",
        "For a time after her deception by Sandeau, she felt absolutely\ndevoid of all emotions. She shunned men, and sought the friendship\nof Marie Dorval, a clever actress who was destined afterward to\nbreak the heart of Alfred de Vigny. The two went down into the\ncountry; and there George Sand wrote hour after hour, sitting by\nher fireside, and showing herself a tender mother to her little\ndaughter Solange.",
        "This life lasted for a while, but it was not the sort of life that\nwould now content her. She had many visitors from Paris, among\nthem Sainte-Beuve, the critic, who brought with him Prosper\nMerimee, then unknown, but later famous as master of revels to the\nthird Napoleon and as the author of Carmen. Merimee had a certain\nfascination of manner, and the predatory instincts of George Sand\nwere again aroused. One day, when she felt bored and desperate,\nMerimee paid his court to her, and she listened to him. This is\none of the most remarkable of her intimacies, since it began,\ncontinued, and ended all in the space of a single week. When\nMerimee left Nohant, he was destined never again to see George\nSand, except long afterward at a dinner-party, where the two\nstared at each other sharply, but did not speak. This affair,\nhowever, made it plain that she could not long remain at Nohant,\nand that she pined for Paris.",
        "Returning thither, she is said to have set her cap at Victor Hugo,\nwho was, however, too much in love with himself to care for any\none, especially a woman who was his literary rival. She is said\nfor a time to have been allied with Gustave Planche, a dramatic\ncritic; but she always denied this, and her denial may be taken as\nquite truthful. Soon, however, she was to begin an episode which\nhas been more famous than any other in her curious history, for\nshe met Alfred de Musset, then a youth of twenty-three, but\nalready well known for his poems and his plays.",
        "Musset was of noble birth. He would probably have been better for\na plebeian strain, since there was in him a touch of the\ndegenerate. His mother’s father had published a humanitarian poem\non cats. His great-uncle had written a peculiar novel. Young\nAlfred was nervous, delicate, slightly epileptic, and it is\ncertain that he was given to dissipation, which so far had\naffected his health only by making him hysterical. He was an\nexceedingly handsome youth, with exquisite manners, “dreamy rather\nthan dazzling eyes, dilated nostrils, and vermilion lips half\nopened.” Such was he when George Sand, then seven years his\nsenior, met him.",
        "There is something which, to the Anglo-Saxon mind, seems far more\nabsurd than pathetic about the events which presently took place.\nA woman like George Sand at thirty was practically twice the age\nof this nervous boy of twenty-three, who had as yet seen little of\nthe world. At first she seemed to realize the fact herself; but\nher vanity led her to begin an intrigue, which must have been\nalmost wholly without excitement on her part, but which to him,\nfor a time, was everything in the world.",
        "Experimenting, as usual, after the fashion described by Dumas, she\nwent with De Musset for a “honeymoon” to Fontainebleau. But they\ncould not stay there forever, and presently they decided upon a\njourney to Italy. Before they went, however, they thought it\nnecessary to get formal permission from Alfred’s mother!",
        "Naturally enough, Mme. de Musset refused consent. She had read\nGeorge Sand’s romances, and had asked scornfully:",
        "“Has the woman never in her life met a gentleman?”",
        "She accepted the relations between them, but that she should be\nasked to sanction this sort of affair was rather too much, even\nfor a French mother who has become accustomed to many strange\nthings. Then there was a curious happening. At nine o’clock at\nnight, George Sand took a cab and drove to the house of Mme. de\nMusset, to whom she sent up a message that a lady wished to see\nher. Mme. de Musset came down, and, finding a woman alone in a\ncarriage, she entered it. Then George Sand burst forth in a\ntorrent of sentimental eloquence. She overpowered her lover’s\nmother, promised to take great care of the delicate youth, and\nfinally drove away to meet Alfred at the coach-yard.",
        "They started off in the mist, their coach being the thirteenth to\nleave the yard; but the two lovers were in a merry mood, and\nenjoyed themselves all the way from Paris to Marseilles. By\nsteamer they went to Leghorn; and finally, in January, 1834, they\ntook an apartment in a hotel at Venice. What had happened that\ntheir arrival in Venice should be the beginning of a quarrel, no\none knows. George Sand has told the story, and Paul de Musset–\nAlfred’s brother–has told the story, but each of them has\ndoubtless omitted a large part of the truth.",
        "It is likely that on their long journey each had learned too much\nof the other. Thus, Paul de Musset says that George Sand made\nherself outrageous by her conversation, telling every one of her\nmother’s adventures in the army of Italy, including her relations\nwith the general-in-chief. She also declared that she herself was\nborn within a month of her parents’ wedding-day. Very likely she\ndid say all these things, whether they were true or not. She had\nset herself to wage war against conventional society, and she did\neverything to shock it.",
        "On the other hand, Alfred de Musset fell ill after having lost ten\nthousand francs in a gambling-house. George Sand was not fond of\npersons who were ill. She herself was working like a horse,\nwriting from eight to thirteen hours a day. When Musset collapsed\nshe sent for a handsome young Italian doctor named Pagello, with\nwhom she had struck up a casual acquaintance. He finally cured\nMusset, but he also cured George Sand of any love for Musset.",
        "Before long she and Pagello were on their way back to Paris,\nleaving the poor, fevered, whimpering poet to bite his nails and\nthink unutterable things. But he ought to have known George Sand.\nAfter that, everybody knew her. They knew just how much she cared\nwhen she professed to care, and when she acted as she acted with\nPagello no earlier lover had any one but himself to blame.",
        "Only sentimentalists can take this story seriously. To them it has\na sort of morbid interest. They like to picture Musset raving and\nshouting in his delirium, and then, to read how George Sand sat on\nPagello’s knees, kissing him and drinking out of the same cup. But\nto the healthy mind the whole story is repulsive–from George\nSand’s appeal to Mme. de Musset down to the very end, when Pagello\ncame to Paris, where his broken French excited a polite ridicule.",
        "There was a touch of genuine sentiment about the affair with Jules\nSandeau; but after that, one can only see in George Sand a half-\nlibidinous grisette, such as her mother was before her, with a\nperfect willingness to experiment in every form of lawless love.\nAs for Musset, whose heart she was supposed to have broken, within\na year he was dangling after the famous singer, Mme. Malibran, and\nwriting poems to her which advertised their intrigue.",
        "After this episode with Pagello, it cannot be said that the life\nof George Sand was edifying in any respect, because no one can\nassume that she was sincere. She had loved Jules Sandeau as much\nas she could love any one, but all the rest of her intrigues and\naffinities were in the nature of experiments. She even took back\nAlfred de Musset, although they could never again regard each\nother without suspicion. George Sand cut off all her hair and gave\nit to Musset, so eager was she to keep him as a matter of\nconquest; but he was tired of her, and even this theatrical trick\nwas of no avail.",
        "She proceeded to other less known and less humiliating adventures.\nShe tried to fascinate the artist Delacroix. She set her cap at\nFranz Liszt, who rather astonished her by saying that only God was\nworthy to be loved. She expressed a yearning for the affections of\nthe elder Dumas; but that good-natured giant laughed at her, and\nin fact gave her some sound advice, and let her smoke\nunsentimentally in his study. She was a good deal taken with a\nnoisy demagogue named Michel, a lawyer at Bourges, who on one\noccasion shut her up in her room and harangued her on sociology\nuntil she was as weary of his talk as of his wooden shoes, his\nshapeless greatcoat, his spectacles, and his skull-cap, Balzac\nfelt her fascination, but cared nothing for her, since his love\nwas given to Mme. Hanska.",
        "In the meanwhile, she was paying visits to her husband at Nohant,\nwhere she wrangled with him over money matters, and where he would\nonce have shot her had the guests present not interfered. She\nsecured her dowry by litigation, so that she was well off, even\nwithout her literary earnings. These were by no means so large as\none would think from her popularity and from the number of books\nshe wrote. It is estimated that her whole gains amounted to about\na million francs, extending over a period of forty-five years. It\nis just half the amount that Trollope earned in about the same\nperiod, and justifies his remark–\"adequate, but not splendid.”",
        "One of those brief and strange intimacies that marked the career\nof George Sand came about in a curious way. Octave Feuillet, a man\nof aristocratic birth, had set himself to write novels which\nportrayed the cynicism and hardness of the upper classes in\nFrance. One of these novels, Sibylle, excited the anger of George\nSand. She had not known Feuillet before; yet now she sought him\nout, at first in order to berate him for his book, but in the end\nto add him to her variegated string of lovers.",
        "It has been said of Feuillet that he was a sort of “domesticated\nMusset.” At any rate, he was far less sensitive than Musset, and\nGeorge Sand was about seventeen years his senior. They parted\nafter a short time, she going her way as a writer of novels that\nwere very different from her earlier ones, while Feuillet grew\nmore and more cynical and even stern, as he lashed the abnormal,\nneuropathic men and women about him.",
        "The last great emotional crisis in George Sand’s life was that\nwhich centers around her relations with Frederic Chopin. Chopin\nwas the greatest genius who ever loved her. It is rather odd that\nhe loved her. She had known him for two years, and had not\nseriously thought of him, though there is a story that when she\nfirst met him she kissed him before he had even been presented to\nher. She waited two years, and in those two years she had three\nlovers. Then at last she once more met Chopin, when he was in a\nstate of melancholy, because a Polish girl had proved unfaithful\nto him.",
        "It was the psychological moment; for this other woman, who was a\ndevourer of hearts, found him at a piano, improvising a\nlamentation. George Sand stood beside him, listening. When he\nfinished and looked up at her, their eyes met. She bent down\nwithout a word and kissed him on the lips.",
        "What was she like when he saw her then? Grenier has described her\nin these words:",
        "She was short and stout, but her face attracted all my attention,\nthe eyes especially. They were wonderful eyes–a little too close\ntogether, it may be, large, with full eyelids, and black, very\nblack, but by no means lustrous; they reminded me of unpolished\nmarble, or rather of velvet, and this gave a strange, dull, even\ncold expression to her countenance. Her fine eyebrows and these\ngreat placid eyes gave her an air of strength and dignity which\nwas not borne out by the lower part of her face. Her nose was\nrather thick and not over shapely. Her mouth was also rather\ncoarse, and her chin small. She spoke with great simplicity, and\nher manners were very quiet.",
        "Such as she was, she attached herself to Chopin for eight years.\nAt first they traveled together very quietly to Majorca; and\nthere, just as Musset had fallen ill at Venice, Chopin became\nfeverish and an invalid. “Chopin coughs most gracefully,” George\nSand wrote of him, and again:",
        "Chopin is the most inconstant of men. There is nothing permanent\nabout him but his cough.",
        "It is not surprising if her nerves sometimes gave way. Acting as\nsick nurse, writing herself with rheumatic fingers, robbed by\nevery one about her, and viewed with suspicion by the peasants\nbecause she did not go to church, she may be perhaps excused for\nher sharp words when, in fact, her deeds were kind.",
        "Afterward, with Chopin, she returned to Paris, and the two lived\nopenly together for seven years longer. An immense literature has\ngrown around the subject of their relations. To this literature\nGeorge Sand herself contributed very largely. Chopin never wrote a\nword; but what he failed to do, his friends and pupils did\nunsparingly.",
        "Probably the truth is somewhat as one might expect. During the\nfirst period of fascination, George Sand was to Chopin what she\nhad been to Sandeau and to Musset; and with her strange and subtle\nways, she had undermined his health. But afterward that sort of\nlove died out, and was succeeded by something like friendship. At\nany rate, this woman showed, as she had shown to others, a vast\nmaternal kindness. She writes to him finally as “your old woman,\"\nand she does wonders in the way of nursing and care.",
        "But in 1847 came a break between the two. Whatever the mystery of\nit may be, it turns upon what Chopin said of Sand:",
        "“I have never cursed any one, but now I am so weary of life that I\nam near cursing her. Yet she suffers, too, and more, because she\ngrows older as she grows more wicked.”",
        "In 1848, Chopin gave his last concert in Paris, and in 1849 he\ndied. According to some, he was the victim of a Messalina.\nAccording to others, it was only “Messalina” that had kept him\nalive so long.",
        "However, with his death came a change in the nature of George\nSand. Emotionally, she was an extinct volcano. Intellectually, she\nwas at her very best. She no longer tore passions into tatters,\nbut wrote naturally, simply, stories of country life and tales for\nchildren. In one of her books she has given an enduring picture of\nthe Franco-Prussian War. There are many rather pleasant\ndescriptions of her then, living at Nohant, where she made a\ncurious figure, bustling about in ill-fitting costumes, and\nsmoking interminable cigarettes.",
        "She had lived much, and she had drunk deep of life, when she died\nin 1876. One might believe her to have been only a woman of\nperpetual liaisons. Externally she was this, and yet what did\nBalzac, that great master of human psychology, write of her in the\nintimacy of a private correspondence?",
        "She is a female bachelor. She is an artist. She is generous. She\nis devoted. She is chaste. Her dominant characteristics are those\nof a man, and therefore, she is not to be regarded as a woman. She\nis an excellent mother, adored by her children. Morally, she is\nlike a lad of twenty; for in her heart of hearts, she is more than\nchaste–she is a prude. It is only in externals that she comports\nherself as a Bohemian. All her follies are titles to glory in the\neyes of those whose souls are noble.",
        "A curious verdict this! Her love-life seems almost that of neither\nman nor woman, but of an animal. Yet whether she was in reality\nresponsible for what she did, when we consider her strange\nheredity, her wretched marriage, the disillusions of her early\nlife–who shall sit in judgment on her, since who knows all?",
        "Perhaps no public man in the English-speaking world, in the last\ncentury, was so widely and intimately known as Charles Dickens.\nFrom his eighteenth year, when he won his first success in\njournalism, down through his series of brilliant triumphs in\nfiction, he was more and more a conspicuous figure, living in the\nblaze of an intense publicity. He met every one and knew every\none, and was the companion of every kind of man and woman. He\nloved to frequent the “caves of harmony” which Thackeray has\nimmortalized, and he was a member of all the best Bohemian clubs\nof London. Actors, authors, good fellows generally, were his\nintimate friends, and his acquaintance extended far beyond into\nthe homes of merchants and lawyers and the mansions of the\nproudest nobles. Indeed, he seemed to be almost a universal\nfriend.",
        "One remembers, for instance, how he was called in to arbitrate\nbetween Thackeray and George Augustus Sala, who had quarreled. One\nremembers how Lord Byron’s daughter, Lady Lovelace, when upon her\nsick-bed, used to send for Dickens because there was something in\nhis genial, sympathetic manner that soothed her. Crushing pieces\nof ice between her teeth in agony, she would speak to him and he\nwould answer her in his rich, manly tones until she was comforted\nand felt able to endure more hours of pain without complaint.",
        "Dickens was a jovial soul. His books fairly steam with Christmas\ncheer and hot punch and the savor of plum puddings, very much as\ndo his letters to his intimate friends. Everybody knew Dickens. He\ncould not dine in public without attracting attention. When he\nleft the dining-room, his admirers would descend upon his table\nand carry off egg-shells, orange-peels, and other things that\nremained behind, so that they might have memorials of this much-\nloved writer. Those who knew him only by sight would often stop\nhim in the streets and ask the privilege of shaking hands with\nhim; so different was he from–let us say–Tennyson, who was as\ngreat an Englishman in his way as Dickens, but who kept himself\naloof and saw few strangers.",
        "It is hard to associate anything like mystery with Dickens, though\nhe was fond of mystery as an intellectual diversion, and his last\nunfinished novel was The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Moreover, no one\nadmired more than he those complex plots which Wilkie Collins used\nto weave under the influence of laudanum. But as for his own life,\nit seemed so normal, so free from anything approaching mystery,\nthat we can scarcely believe it to have been tinged with darker\ncolors than those which appeared upon the surface.",
        "A part of this mystery is plain enough. The other part is still\nobscure–or of such a character that one does not care to bring it\nwholly to the light. It had to do with his various relations with\nwomen.",
        "The world at large thinks that it knows this chapter in the life\nof Dickens, and that it refers wholly to his unfortunate\ndisagreement with his wife. To be sure, this is a chapter that is\nwrit large in all of his biographies, and yet it is nowhere\ncorrectly told. His chosen biographer was John Forster, whose Life\nof Charles Dickens, in three volumes, must remain a standard work;\nbut even Forster–we may assume through tact–has not set down all\nthat he could, although he gives a clue.",
        "As is well known, Dickens married Miss Catherine Hogarth when he\nwas only twenty-four. He had just published his Sketches by Boz,\nthe copyright of which he sold for one hundred pounds, and was\nbeginning the Pickwick Papers. About this time his publisher\nbrought N. P. Willis down to Furnival’s Inn to see the man whom\nWillis called “a young paragraphist for the Morning Chronicle.\"\nWillis thus sketches Dickens and his surroundings:",
        "In the most crowded part of Holborn, within a door or two of the\nBull and Mouth Inn, we pulled up at the entrance of a large\nbuilding used for lawyers’ chambers. I followed by a long flight\nof stairs to an upper story, and was ushered into an uncarpeted\nand bleak-looking room, with a deal table, two or three chairs and\na few books, a small boy and Mr. Dickens for the contents.",
        "I was only struck at first with one thing–and I made a memorandum\nof it that evening as the strongest instance I had seen of English\nobsequiousness to employers–the degree to which the poor author\nwas overpowered with the honor of his publisher’s visit! I\nremember saying to myself, as I sat down on a rickety chair:",
        "“My good fellow, if you were in America with that fine face and\nyour ready quill, you would have no need to be condescended to by\na publisher.”",
        "Dickens was dressed very much as he has since described Dick\nSwiveller, minus the swell look. His hair was cropped close to his\nhead, his clothes scant, though jauntily cut, and, after changing\na ragged office-coat for a shabby blue, he stood by the door,\ncollarless and buttoned up, the very personification of a close\nsailer to the wind.",
        "Before this interview with Willis, which Dickens always\nrepudiated, he had become something of a celebrity among the\nnewspaper men with whom he worked as a stenographer. As every one\nknows, he had had a hard time in his early years, working in a\nblacking-shop, and feeling too keenly the ignominious position of\nwhich a less sensitive boy would probably have thought nothing.\nThen he became a shorthand reporter, and was busy at his work, so\nthat he had little time for amusements.",
        "It has been generally supposed that no love-affair entered his\nlife until he met Catherine Hogarth, whom he married soon after\nmaking her acquaintance. People who are eager at ferreting out\nunimportant facts about important men had unanimously come to the\nconclusion that up to the age of twenty Dickens was entirely\nfancy-free. It was left to an American to disclose the fact that\nthis was not the case, but that even in his teens he had been\ncaptivated by a girl of about his own age.",
        "Inasmuch as the only reproach that was ever made against Dickens\nwas based upon his love-affairs, let us go back and trace them\nfrom this early one to the very last, which must yet for some\nyears, at least, remain a mystery.",
        "Everything that is known about his first affair is contained in a\nbook very beautifully printed, but inaccessible to most readers.\nSome years ago Mr. William K. Bixby, of St. Louis, found in London\na collector of curios. This man had in his stock a number of\nletters which had passed between a Miss Maria Beadnell and Charles\nDickens when the two were about nineteen and a second package of\nletters representing a later acquaintance, about 1855, at which\ntime Miss Beadnell had been married for a long time to a Mr. Henry\nLouis Winter, of 12 Artillery Place, London.",
        "The copyright laws of Great Britain would not allow Mr. Bixby to\npublish the letters in that country, and he did not care to give\nthem to the public here. Therefore, he presented them to the\nBibliophile Society, with the understanding that four hundred and\nninety-three copies, with the Bibliophile book-plate, were to be\nprinted and distributed among the members of the society. A few\nadditional copies were struck off, but these did not bear the\nBibliophile book-plate. Only two copies are available for other\nreaders, and to peruse these it is necessary to visit the\nCongressional Library in Washington, where they were placed on\nJuly 24, 1908.",
        "These letters form two series–the first written to Miss Beadnell\nin or about 1829, and the second written to Mrs. Winter, formerly\nMiss Beadnell, in 1855.",
        "The book also contains an introduction by Henry H. Harper, who\nsets forth some theories which the facts, in my opinion, do not\nsupport; and there are a number of interesting portraits,\nespecially one of Miss Beadnell in 1829–a lovely girl with dark\ncurls. Another shows her in 1855, when she writes of herself as\n\"old and fat\"–thereby doing herself a great deal of injustice;\nfor although she had lost her youthful beauty, she was a very\npresentable woman of middle age, but one who would not be\nparticularly noticed in any company.",
        "Summing up briefly these different letters, it may be said that in\nthe first set Dickens wrote to the lady ardently, but by no means\npassionately. From what he says it is plain enough that she did\nnot respond to his feeling, and that presently she left London and\nwent to Paris, for her family was well-to-do, while Dickens was\nliving from hand to mouth.",
        "In the second set of letters, written long afterward, Mrs. Winter\nseems to have “set her cap” at the now famous author; but at that\ntime he was courted by every one, and had long ago forgotten the\nlady who had so easily dismissed him in his younger days. In 1855,\nMrs. Winter seems to have reproached him for not having been more\nconstant in the past; but he replied:",
        "You answered me coldly and reproachfully, and so I went my way.",
        "Mr. Harper, in his introduction, tries very hard to prove that in\nwriting David Copperfield Dickens drew the character of Dora from\nMiss Beadnell. It is a dangerous thing to say from whom any\ncharacter in a novel is drawn. An author takes whatever suits his\npurpose in circumstance and fancy, and blends them all into one\nconsistent whole, which is not to be identified with any\nindividual. There is little reason to think that the most intimate\nfriends of Dickens and of his family were mistaken through all the\nyears when they were certain that the boy husband and the girl\nwife of David Copperfield were suggested by any one save Dickens\nhimself and Catherine Hogarth.",
        "Why should he have gone back to a mere passing fancy, to a girl\nwho did not care for him, and who had no influence on his life,\ninstead of picturing, as David’s first wife, one whom he deeply\nloved, whom he married, who was the mother of his children, and\nwho made a great part of his career, even that part which was\ninwardly half tragic and wholly mournful?",
        "Miss Beadnell may have been the original of Flora in Little\nDorrit, though even this is doubtful. The character was at the\ntime ascribed to a Miss Anna Maria Leigh, whom Dickens sometimes\nflirted with and sometimes caricatured.",
        "When Dickens came to know George Hogarth, who was one of his\ncolleagues on the staff of the Morning Chronicle, he met Hogarth’s\ndaughters–Catherine, Georgina, and Mary–and at once fell\nardently in love with Catherine, the eldest and prettiest of the\nthree. He himself was almost girlish, with his fair complexion and\nlight, wavy hair, so that the famous sketch by Maclise has a\nremarkable charm; yet nobody could really say with truth that any\none of the three girls was beautiful. Georgina Hogarth, however,\nwas sweet-tempered and of a motherly disposition. It may be that\nin a fashion she loved Dickens all her life, as she remained with\nhim after he parted from her sister, taking the utmost care of his\nchildren, and looking out with unselfish fidelity for his many\nneeds.",
        "It was Mary, however, the youngest of the Hogarths, who lived with\nthe Dickenses during the first twelvemonth of their married life.\nTo Dickens she was like a favorite sister, and when she died very\nsuddenly, in her eighteenth year, her loss was a great shock to\nhim.",
        "It was believed for a long time–in fact, until their separation–\nthat Dickens and his wife were extremely happy in their home life.\nHis writings glorified all that was domestic, and paid many tender\ntributes to the joys of family affection. When the separation came\nthe whole world was shocked. And yet rather early in Dickens’s\nmarried life there was more or less infelicity. In his\nRetrospections of an Active Life, Mr. John Bigelow writes a few\nsentences which are interesting for their frankness, and which\ngive us certain hints:",
        "Mrs. Dickens was not a handsome woman, though stout, hearty, and\nmatronly; there was something a little doubtful about her eye, and\nI thought her endowed with a temper that might be very violent\nwhen roused, though not easily rousable. Mrs. Caulfield told me\nthat a Miss Teman–I think that is the name–was the source of the\ndifficulty between Mrs. Dickens and her husband. She played in\nprivate theatricals with Dickens, and he sent her a portrait in a\nbrooch, which met with an accident requiring it to be sent to the\njeweler’s to be mended. The jeweler, noticing Mr. Dickens’s\ninitials, sent it to his house. Mrs. Dickens’s sister, who had\nalways been in love with him and was jealous of Miss Teman, told\nMrs. Dickens of the brooch, and she mounted her husband with comb\nand brush. This, no doubt, was Mrs. Dickens’s version, in the\nmain.",
        "A few evenings later I saw Miss Teman at the Haymarket Theatre,\nplaying with Buckstone and Mr. and Mrs. Charles Mathews. She\nseemed rather a small cause for such a serious result–passably\npretty, and not much of an actress.",
        "Here in one passage we have an intimation that Mrs. Dickens had a\ntemper that was easily roused, that Dickens himself was interested\nin an actress, and that Miss Hogarth “had always been in love with\nhim, and was jealous of Miss Teman.”",
        "Some years before this time, however, there had been growing in\nthe mind of Dickens a certain formless discontent–something to\nwhich he could not give a name, yet which, cast over him the\nshadow of disappointment. He expressed the same feeling in David\nCopperfield, when he spoke of David’s life with Dora. It seemed to\ncome from the fact that he had grown to be a man, while his wife\nhad still remained a child.",
        "A passage or two may be quoted from the novel, so that we may set\nthem beside passages in Dickens’s own life, which we know to have\nreferred to his own wife, and not to any such nebulous person as\nMrs. Winter.",
        "The shadow I have mentioned that was not to be between us any\nmore, but was to rest wholly on my heart–how did that fall? The\nold unhappy feeling pervaded my life. It was deepened, if it were\nchanged at all; but it was as undefined as ever, and addressed me\nlike a strain of sorrowful music faintly heard in the night. I\nloved my wife dearly; but the happiness I had vaguely anticipated,\nonce, was not the happiness I enjoyed, AND THERE WAS ALWAYS\nSOMETHING WANTING.",
        "What I missed I still regarded as something that had been a dream\nof my youthful fancy; that was incapable of realization; that I\nwas now discovering to be so, with some natural pain, as all men\ndid. But that it would have been better for me if my wife could\nhave helped me more, and shared the many thoughts in which I had\nno partner, and that this might have been I knew.",
        "What I am describing slumbered and half awoke and slept again in\nthe innermost recesses of my mind. There was no evidence of it to\nme; I knew of no influence it had in anything I said or did. I\nbore the weight of all our little cares and all my projects.",
        "“There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind\nand purpose.” These words I remembered. I had endeavored to adapt\nDora to myself, and found it impracticable. It remained for me to\nadapt myself to Dora; to share with her what I could, and be\nhappy; to bear on my own shoulders what I must, and be still\nhappy.",
        "Thus wrote Dickens in his fictitious character, and of his\nfictitious wife. Let us see how he wrote and how he acted in his\nown person, and of his real wife.",
        "As early as 1856, he showed a curious and restless activity, as of\none who was trying to rid himself of unpleasant thoughts. Mr.\nForster says that he began to feel a strain upon his invention, a\ncertain disquietude, and a necessity for jotting down memoranda in\nnote-books, so as to assist his memory and his imagination. He\nbegan to long for solitude. He would take long, aimless rambles\ninto the country, returning at no particular time or season. He\nonce wrote to Forster:",
        "I have had dreadful thoughts of getting away somewhere altogether\nby myself. If I could have managed it, I think I might have gone\nto the Pyrenees for six months. I have visions of living for half\na year or so in all sorts of inaccessible places, and of opening a\nnew book therein. A floating idea of going up above the snow-line,\nand living in some astonishing convent, hovers over me.",
        "What do these cryptic utterances mean? At first, both in his novel\nand in his letters, they are obscure; but before long, in each,\nthey become very definite. In 1856, we find these sentences among\nhis letters:",
        "The old days–the old days! Shall I ever, I wonder, get the frame\nof mind back as it used to be then? Something of it, perhaps, but\nnever quite as it used to be.",
        "I find that the skeleton in my domestic closet is becoming a\npretty big one.",
        "His next letter draws the veil and shows plainly what he means:",
        "Poor Catherine and I are not made for each other, and there is no\nhelp for it. It is not only that she makes me uneasy and unhappy,\nbut that I make her so, too–and much more so. We are strangely\nill-assorted for the bond that exists between us.",
        "Then he goes on to say that she would have been a thousand times\nhappier if she had been married to another man. He speaks of\n\"incompatibility,” and a “difference of temperaments.” In fact, it\nis the same old story with which we have become so familiar, and\nwhich is both as old as the hills and as new as this morning’s\nnewspaper.",
        "Naturally, also, things grow worse, rather than better. Dickens\ncomes to speak half jocularly of “the plunge,” and calculates as\nto what effect it will have on his public readings. He kept back\nthe announcement of “the plunge” until after he had given several\nreadings; then, on April 29, 1858, Mrs. Dickens left his home. His\neldest son went to live with the mother, but the rest of the\nchildren remained with their father, while his daughter Mary\nnominally presided over the house. In the background, however,\nGeorgina Hogarth, who seemed all through her life to have cared\nfor Dickens more than for her sister, remained as a sort of guide\nand guardian for his children.",
        "This arrangement was a private matter, and should not have been\nbrought to public attention; but it was impossible to suppress all\ngossip about so prominent a man. Much of the gossip was\nexaggerated; and when it came to the notice of Dickens it stung\nhim so severely as to lead him into issuing a public justification\nof his course. He published a statement in Household Words, which\nled to many other letters in other periodicals, and finally a long\none from him, which was printed in the New York Tribune, addressed\nto his friend Mr. Arthur Smith.",
        "Dickens afterward declared that he had written this letter as a\nstrictly personal and private one, in order to correct false\nrumors and scandals. Mr. Smith naturally thought that the\nstatement was intended for publication, but Dickens always spoke\nof it as “the violated letter.”",
        "By his allusions to a difference of temperament and to\nincompatibility, Dickens no doubt meant that his wife had ceased\nto be to him the same companion that she had been in days gone by.\nAs in so many cases, she had not changed, while he had. He had\ngrown out of the sphere in which he had been born, “associated\nwith blacking-boys and quilt-printers,” and had become one of the\ngreat men of his time, whose genius was universally admired.",
        "Mr. Bigelow saw Mrs. Dickens as she really was–a commonplace\nwoman endowed with the temper of a vixen, and disposed to\noutbursts of actual violence when her jealousy was roused.",
        "It was impossible that the two could have remained together, when\nin intellect and sympathy they were so far apart. There is nothing\nstrange about their separation, except the exceedingly bad taste\nwith which Dickens made it a public affair. It is safe to assume\nthat he felt the need of a different mate; and that he found one\nis evident enough from the hints and bits of innuendo that are\nfound in the writings of his contemporaries.",
        "He became a pleasure-lover; but more than that, he needed one who\ncould understand his moods and match them, one who could please\nhis tastes, and one who could give him that admiration which he\nfelt to be his due; for he was always anxious to be praised, and\nhis letters are full of anecdotes relating to his love of praise.",
        "One does not wish to follow out these clues too closely. It is\ncertain that neither Miss Beadnell as a girl nor Mrs. Winter as a\nmatron made any serious appeal to him. The actresses who have been\noften mentioned in connection with his name were, for the most\npart, mere passing favorites. The woman who in life was Dora made\nhim feel the same incompleteness that he has described in his\nbest-known book. The companion to whom he clung in his later years\nwas neither a light-minded creature like Miss Beadnell, nor an\nundeveloped, high-tempered woman like the one he married, nor a\nmere domestic, friendly creature like Georgina Hogarth.",
        "Ought we to venture upon a quest which shall solve this mystery in\nthe life of Charles Dickens! In his last will and testament, drawn\nup and signed by him about a year before his death, the first\nparagraph reads as follows:",
        "I, Charles Dickens, of Gadshill Place, Higham, in the county of\nKent, hereby revoke all my former wills and codicils and declare\nthis to be my last will and testament. I give the sum of one\nthousand pounds, free of legacy duty, to Miss Ellen Lawless\nTernan, late of Houghton Place, Ampthill Square, in the county of\nMiddlesex.",
        "In connection with this, read Mr. John Bigelow’s careless jottings\nmade some fifteen years before. Remember the Miss “Teman,” about\nwhose name he was not quite certain; the Hogarth sisters’ dislike\nof her; and the mysterious figure in the background of the\nnovelist’s later life. Then consider the first bequest in his\nwill, which leaves a substantial sum to one who was neither a\nrelative nor a subordinate, but–may we assume–more than an\nordinary friend?",
        "I remember once, when editing an elaborate work on literature,\nthat the publisher called me into his private office. After the\ndoor was closed, he spoke in tones of suppressed emotion.",
        "“Why is it,” said he, “that you have such a lack of proportion? In\nthe selection you have made I find that only two pages are given\nto George P. Morris, while you haven’t given E. P. Roe any space\nat all! Yet, look here–you’ve blocked out fifty pages for Balzac,\nwho was nothing but an immoral Frenchman!”",
        "I adjusted this difficulty, somehow or other–I do not just\nremember how–and began to think that, after all, this publisher’s\nview of things was probably that of the English and American\npublic. It is strange that so many biographies and so many\nappreciations of the greatest novelist who ever lived should still\nhave left him, in the eyes of the reading public, little more than\n\"an immoral Frenchman.”",
        "“In Balzac,” said Taine, “there was a money-broker, an\narcheologist, an architect, an upholsterer, a tailor, an old-\nclothes dealer, a journeyman apprentice, a physician, and a\nnotary.” Balzac was also a mystic, a supernaturalist, and, above\nall, a consummate artist. No one who is all these things in high\nmeasure, and who has raised himself by his genius above his\ncountrymen, deserves the censure of my former publisher.",
        "Still less is Balzac to be dismissed as “immoral,” for his life\nwas one of singular self-sacrifice in spite of much temptation.\nHis face was strongly sensual, his look and bearing denoted almost\nsavage power; he led a free life in a country which allowed much\nfreedom; and yet his story is almost mystic in its fineness of\nthought, and in its detachment, which was often that of another\nworld.",
        "Balzac was born in 1799, at Tours, with all the traits of the\npeople of his native province–fond of eating and drinking, and\nwith plenty of humor. His father was fairly well off. Of four\nchildren, our Balzac was the eldest. The third was his sister\nLaure, who throughout his life was the most intimate friend he\nhad, and to whom we owe his rescue from much scandalous and untrue\ngossip. From her we learn that their father was a combination of\nMontaigne, Rabelais, and “Uncle Toby.”",
        "Young Balzac went to a clerical school at seven, and stayed there\nfor seven years. Then he was brought home, apparently much\nprostrated, although the good fathers could find nothing\nphysically amiss with him, and nothing in his studies to account\nfor his agitation. No one ever did discover just what was the\nmatter, for he seemed well enough in the next few years, basking\non the riverside, watching the activities of his native town, and\nthoroughly studying the rustic types that he was afterward to make\nfamiliar to the world. In fact, in Louis Lambert he has set before\nus a picture of his own boyish life, very much as Dickens did of\nhis in David Copperfield.",
        "For some reason, when these years were over, the boy began to have\nwhat is so often known as “a call\"–a sort of instinct that he was\nto attain renown. Unfortunately it happened that about this time\n(1814) he and his parents removed to Paris, which was his home by\nchoice, until his death in 1850. He studied here under famous\nteachers, and gave three years to the pursuit of law, of which he\nwas very fond as literary material, though he refused to practise.",
        "This was the more grievous, since a great part of the family\nproperty had been lost. The Balzacs were afflicted by actual\npoverty, and Honore endeavored, with his pen, to beat the wolf\nback from the door. He earned a little money with pamphlets and\noccasional stories, but his thirst for fame was far from\nsatisfied. He was sure that he was called to literature, and yet\nhe was not sure that he had the power to succeed. In one of his\nletters to his sister, he wrote:",
        "I am young and hungry, and there is nothing on my plate. Oh,\nLaure, Laure, my two boundless desires, my only ones–to be\nfamous, and to be loved–they ever be satisfied?",
        "For the next ten years he was learning his trade, and the artistic\nuse of the fiction writer’s tools. What is more to the point, is\nthe fact that he began to dream of a series of great novels, which\nshould give a true and panoramic picture of the whole of human\nlife. This was the first intimation of his “Human Comedy,” which\nwas so daringly undertaken and so nearly completed in his after\nyears. In his early days of obscurity, he said to his readers:",
        "Note well the characters that I introduce, since you will have to\nfollow their fortunes through thirty novels that are to come.",
        "Here we see how little he had been daunted by ill success, and how\nhis prodigious imagination had not been overcome by sorrow and\nevil fortune. Meantime, writing almost savagely, and with a\nfeeling combined of ambition and despair, he had begun, very\nslowly indeed, to create a public. These ten years, however, had\nloaded him with debts; and his struggle to keep himself afloat\nonly plunged him deeper in the mire. His thirty unsigned novels\nbegan to pay him a few hundred francs, not in cash, but in\npromissory notes; so that he had to go still deeper into debt.",
        "In 1827 he was toiling on his first successful novel, and indeed\none of the best historic novels in French literature–The Chouans.\nHe speaks of his labor as “done with a tired brain and an anxious\nmind,” and of the eight or ten business letters that he had to\nwrite each day before he could begin his literary work.",
        "“Postage and an omnibus are extravagances that I cannot allow\nmyself,” he writes. “I stay at home so as not to wear out my\nclothes. Is that clear to you?”",
        "At the end of the next year, though he was already popular as a\nnovelist, and much sought out by people of distinction, he was at\nthe very climax of his poverty. He had written thirty-five books,\nand was in debt to the amount of a hundred and twenty-four\nthousand francs. He was saved from bankruptcy only by the aid of\nMme. de Berny, a woman of high character, and one whose moral\ninfluence was very strong with Balzac until her early death.",
        "The relation between these two has a sweetness and a purity which\nare seldom found. Mme. de Berny gave Balzac money as she would\nhave given it to a son, and thereby she saved a great soul for\nliterature. But there was no sickly sentiment between them, and\nBalzac regarded her with a noble love which he has expressed in\nthe character of Mme. Firmiani.",
        "It was immediately after she had lightened his burdens that the\nreal Balzac comes before us in certain stories which have no\nequal, and which are among the most famous that he ever wrote.\nWhat could be more wonderful than his El Verdugo, which gives us a\nbrief horror while compelling our admiration? What, outside of\nBalzac himself, could be more terrible than Gobseck, a frightful\nstudy of avarice, containing a deathbed scene which surpasses in\ndreadfulness almost anything in literature? Add to these A Passion\nin the Desert, The Girl with the Golden Eyes, The Droll Stories,\nThe Red Inn, and The Magic Skin, and you have a cluster of\nmasterpieces not to be surpassed.",
        "In the year 1829, when he was just beginning to attain a slight\nsuccess, Balzac received a long letter written in a woman’s hand.\nAs he read it, there came to him something very like an\ninspiration, so full of understanding were the written words, so\nfull of appreciation and of sympathy with the best that he had\ndone. This anonymous note pointed out here and there such defects\nas are apt to become chronic with a young author. Balzac was\ngreatly stirred by its keen and sympathetic criticism. No one\nbefore had read his soul so clearly. No one–not even his devoted\nsister, Laure de Surville–had judged his work so wisely, had come\nso closely to his deepest feeling.",
        "He read the letter over and over, and presently another came, full\nof critical appreciation, and of wholesome, tonic, frank, friendly\nwords of cheer. It was very largely the effect of these letters\nthat roused Balzac’s full powers and made him sure of winning the\ntwo great objects of his first ambition–love and fame–the ideals\nof the chivalrous, romantic Frenchman from Caesar’s time down to\nthe present day.",
        "Other letters followed, and after a while their authorship was\nmade known to Balzac. He learned that they had been written by a\nyoung Polish lady, Mme. Evelina Hanska, the wife of a Polish\ncount, whose health was feeble, and who spent much time in\nSwitzerland because the climate there agreed with him.",
        "He met her first at Neuchatel, and found her all that he had\nimagined. It is said that she had no sooner raised her face, and\nlooked him fully in the eyes, than she fell fainting to the floor,\novercome by her emotion. Balzac himself was deeply moved. From\nthat day until their final meeting he wrote to her daily.",
        "The woman who had become his second soul was not beautiful.\nNevertheless, her face was intensely spiritual, and there was a\nmystic quality about it which made a strong appeal to Balzac’s\ninnermost nature. Those who saw him in Paris knocking about the\nstreets at night with his boon companions, hobnobbing with the\nelder Dumas, or rejecting the frank advances of George Sand, would\nnever have dreamed of this mysticism.",
        "Balzac was heavy and broad of figure. His face was suggestive only\nof what was sensuous and sensual. At the same time, those few who\nlooked into his heart and mind found there many a sign of the fine\ninner strain which purified the grosser elements of his nature. He\nwho wrote the roaring Rabelaisian Contes Drolatiques was likewise\nthe author of Seraphita.",
        "This mysticism showed itself in many things that Balzac did. One\nlittle incident will perhaps be sufficiently characteristic of\nmany others. He had a belief that names had a sort of esoteric\nappropriateness. So, in selecting them for his novels, he gathered\nthem with infinite pains from many sources, and then weighed them\nanxiously in the balance. A writer on the subject of names and\ntheir significance has given the following account of this trait:",
        "The great novelist once spent an entire day tramping about in the\nremotest quarters of Paris in search of a fitting name for a\ncharacter just conceived by him. Every sign-board, every door-\nplate, every affiche upon the walls, was scrutinized. Thousands of\nnames were considered and rejected, and it was only after his\ncompanion, utterly worn out by fatigue, had flatly refused to drag\nhis weary limbs through more than one additional street, that\nBalzac suddenly saw upon a sign the name “Marcas,” and gave a\nshout of joy at having finally secured what he was seeking.",
        "Marcas it was, from that moment; and Balzac gradually evolved a\nChristian name for him. First he considered what initial was most\nappropriate; and then, having decided upon Z, he went on to expand\nthis into Zepherin, explaining minutely just why the whole name\nZepherin Marcas, was the only possible one for the character in\nthe novel.",
        "In many ways Balzac and Evelina Hanska were mated by nature.\nWhether they were fully mated the facts of their lives must\ndemonstrate. For the present, the novelist plunged into a whirl of\nliterary labor, toiling as few ever toiled–constructing several\nnovels at the same time, visiting all the haunts of the French\ncapital, so that he might observe and understand every type of\nhuman being, and then hurling himself like a giant at his work.",
        "He had a curious practise of reading proofs. These would come to\nhim in enormous sheets, printed on special paper, and with wide\nmargins for his corrections. An immense table stood in the midst\nof his study, and upon the top he would spread out the proofs as\nif they were vast maps. Then, removing most of his outer garments,\nhe would lie, face down, upon the proof-sheets, with a gigantic\npencil, such as Bismarck subsequently used to wield. Thus\ndisposed, he would go over the proofs.",
        "Hardly anything that he had written seemed to suit him when he saw\nit in print. He changed and kept changing, obliterating what he\ndisliked, writing in new sentences, revising others, and adding\nwhole pages in the margins, until perhaps he had practically made\na new book. This process was repeated several times; and how\nexpensive it was may be judged from the fact that his bill for\n\"author’s proof corrections” was sometimes more than the\npublishers had agreed to pay him for the completed volume.",
        "Sometimes, again, he would begin writing in the afternoon, and\ncontinue until dawn. Then, weary, aching in every bone, and with\nthrobbing head, he would rise and turn to fall upon his couch\nafter his eighteen hours of steady toil. But the memory of Evelina\nHanska always came to him; and with half-numbed fingers he would\nseize his pen, and forget his weariness in the pleasure of writing\nto the dark-eyed woman who drew him to her like a magnet.",
        "These are very curious letters that Balzac wrote to Mme. Hanska.\nHe literally told her everything about himself. Not only were\nthere long passages instinct with tenderness, and with his love\nfor her; but he also gave her the most minute account of\neverything that occurred, and that might interest her. Thus he\ndetailed at length his mode of living, the clothes he wore, the\npeople whom he met, his trouble with his creditors, the accounts\nof his income and outgo. One might think that this was egotism on\nhis part; but it was more than that. It was a strong belief that\neverything which concerned him must concern her; and he begged her\nin turn to write as freely and as fully.",
        "Mme. Hanska was not the only woman who became his friend and\ncomrade, and to whom he often wrote. He made many acquaintances in\nthe fashionable world through the good offices of the Duchesse de\nCastries. By her favor, he studied with his microscopic gaze the\nbeau monde of Louis Philippe’s rather unimpressive court.",
        "In a dozen books he scourged the court of the citizen king–its\npretensions, its commonness, and its assemblage of nouveaux\nriches. Yet in it he found many friends–Victor Hugo, the\nGirardins–and among them women who were of the world. George Sand\nhe knew very well, and she made ardent love to him; but he laughed\nher off very much as the elder Dumas did.",
        "Then there was the pretty, dainty Mme. Carraud, who read and\nrevised his manuscripts, and who perhaps took a more intimate\ninterest in him than did the other ladies whom he came to know so\nwell. Besides Mme. Hanska, he had another correspondent who signed\nherself “Louise,” but who never let him know her name, though she\nwrote him many piquant, sunny letters, which he so sadly needed.",
        "For though Honore de Balzac was now one of the most famous writers\nof his time, his home was still a den of suffering. His debts kept\npressing on him, loading him down, and almost quenching hope. He\nacted toward his creditors like a man of honor, and his physical\nstrength was still that of a giant. To Mme. Carraud he once wrote\nthe half pathetic, half humorous plaint:",
        "Poor pen! It must be diamond, not because one would wish to wear\nit, but because it has had so much use!",
        "And again:",
        "Here I am, owing a hundred thousand francs. And I am forty!",
        "Balzac and Mme. Hanska met many times after that first eventful\nepisode at Neuchatel. It was at this time that he gave utterance\nto the poignant cry:",
        "Love for me is life, and to-day I feel it more than ever!",
        "In like manner he wrote, on leaving her, that famous epigram:",
        "It is only the last love of a woman that can satisfy the first\nlove of a man.",
        "In 1842 Mme. Hanska’s husband died. Balzac naturally expected that\nan immediate marriage with the countess would take place; but the\nwoman who had loved him mystically for twelve years, and with a\ntouch of the physical for nine, suddenly draws back. She will not\npromise anything. She talks of delays, owing to the legal\narrangements for her children. She seems almost a prude. An\nAmerican critic has contrasted her attitude with his:",
        "Every one knows how utterly and absolutely Balzac devoted to this\none woman all his genius, his aspiration, the thought of his every\nmoment; how every day, after he had labored like a slave for\neighteen hours, he would take his pen and pour out to her the most\nintimate details of his daily life; how at her call he would leave\neverything and rush across the continent to Poland or to Italy,\nbeing radiantly happy if he could but see her face and be for a\nfew days by her side. The very thought of meeting her thrilled him\nto the very depths of his nature, and made him, for weeks and even\nmonths beforehand, restless, uneasy, and agitated, with an almost\npainful happiness.",
        "It is the most startling proof of his immense vitality, both\nphysical and mental, that so tremendous an emotional strain could\nbe endured by him for years without exhausting his fecundity or\nblighting his creativeness.",
        "With Balzac, however, it was the period of his most brilliant\nwork; and this was true in spite of the anguish of long\nseparations, and the complaints excited by what appears to be\ncaprice or boldness or a faint indifference. Even in Balzac one\nnotices toward the last a certain sense of strain underlying what\nhe wrote, a certain lack of elasticity and facility, if of nothing\nmore; yet on the whole it is likely that without this friendship\nBalzac would have been less great than he actually became, as it\nis certain that had it been broken off he would have ceased to\nwrite or to care for anything whatever in the world.",
        "And yet, when they were free to marry, Mme. Hanska shrank away.\nNot until 1846, four years after her husband’s death, did she\nfinally give her promise to the eager Balzac. Then, in the\noverflow of his happiness, his creative genius blazed up into a\nmost wonderful flame; but he soon discovered that the promise was\nnot to be at once fulfilled. The shock impaired that marvelous\nvitality which had carried him through debt, and want, and endless\nlabor.",
        "It was at this moment, by the irony of fate, that his country\nhailed him as one of the greatest of its men of genius. A golden\nstream poured into his lap. His debts were not all extinguished,\nbut his income was so large that they burdened him no longer.",
        "But his one long dream was the only thing for which he cared; and\nthough in an exoteric sense this dream came true, its truth was\nbut a mockery. Evelina Hanska summoned him to Poland, and Balzac\nwent to her at once. There was another long delay, and for more\nthan a year he lived as a guest in the countess’s mansion at\nWierzchownia; but finally, in March, 1850, the two were married. A\nfew weeks later they came back to France together, and occupied\nthe little country house, Les Jardies, in which, some decades\nlater, occurred Gambetta’s mysterious death.",
        "What is the secret of this strange love, which in the woman seems\nto be not precisely love, but something else? Balzac was always\neager for her presence. She, on the other hand, seems to have been\nmentally more at ease when he was absent. Perhaps the explanation,\nif we may venture upon one, is based upon a well-known\nphysiological fact.",
        "Love in its completeness is made up of two great elements–first,\nthe element that is wholly spiritual, that is capable of sympathy,\nand tenderness, and deep emotion. The other element is the\nphysical, the source of passion, of creative energy, and of the\ntruly virile qualities, whether it be in man or woman. Now, let\neither of these elements be lacking, and love itself cannot fully\nand utterly exist. The spiritual nature in one may find its mate\nin the spiritual nature of another; and the physical nature of one\nmay find its mate in the physical nature of another. But into\nunions such as these, love does not enter in its completeness. If\nthere is any element lacking in either of those who think that\nthey can mate, their mating will be a sad and pitiful failure.",
        "It is evident enough that Mme. Hanska was almost wholly spiritual,\nand her long years of waiting had made her understand the\ndifference between Balzac and herself. Therefore, she shrank from\nhis proximity, and from his physical contact, and it was perhaps\nbetter for them both that their union was so quickly broken off by\ndeath; for the great novelist died of heart disease only five\nmonths after the marriage.",
        "If we wish to understand the mystery of Balzac’s life–or, more\ntruly, the mystery of the life of the woman whom he married–take\nup and read once more the pages of Seraphita, one of his poorest\nnovels and yet a singularly illuminating story, shedding light\nupon a secret of the soul.",
        "The instances of distinguished men, or of notable women, who have\nbroken through convention in order to find a fitting mate, are\nvery numerous. A few of these instances may, perhaps, represent\nwhat is usually called a Platonic union. But the evidence is\nalways doubtful. The world is not possessed of abundant charity,\nnor does human experience lead one to believe that intimate\nrelations between a man and a woman are compatible with Platonic\nfriendship.",
        "Perhaps no case is more puzzling than that which is found in the\nlife-history of Charles Reade and Laura Seymour.",
        "Charles Reade belongs to that brilliant group of English writers\nand artists which included Dickens, Bulwer-Lytton, Wilkie Collins,\nTom Taylor, George Eliot, Swinburne, Sir Walter Besant, Maclise,\nand Goldwin Smith. In my opinion, he ranks next to Dickens in\noriginality and power. His books are little read to-day; yet he\ngave to the English stage the comedy “Masks and Faces,” which is\nnow as much a classic as Goldsmith’s “She Stoops to Conquer” or\nSheridan’s “School for Scandal.” His power as a novelist was\nmarvelous. Who can forget the madhouse episodes in Hard Cash, or\nthe great trial scene in Griffith Gaunt, or that wonderful\npicture, in The Cloister and the Hearth, of Germany and Rome at\nthe end of the Middle Ages? Here genius has touched the dead past\nand made it glow again with an intense reality.",
        "He was the son of a country gentleman, the lord of a manor which\nhad been held by his family before the Wars of the Boses. His\nancestors had been noted for their services in warfare, in\nParliament, and upon the bench. Reade, therefore, was in feeling\nvery much of an aristocrat. Sometimes he pushed his ancestral\npride to a whimsical excess, very much as did his own creation,\nSquire Raby, in Put Yourself in His Place.",
        "At the same time he might very well have been called a Tory\ndemocrat. His grandfather had married the daughter of a village\nblacksmith, and Reade was quite as proud of this as he was of the\nfact that another ancestor had been lord chief justice of England.\nFrom the sturdy strain which came to him from the blacksmith he,\nperhaps, derived that sledge-hammer power with which he wrote many\nof his most famous chapters, and which he used in newspaper\ncontroversies with his critics. From his legal ancestors there may\nhave come to him the love of litigation, which kept him often in\nhot water. From those who had figured in the life of royal courts,\nhe inherited a romantic nature, a love of art, and a very delicate\nperception of the niceties of cultivated usage. Such was Charles\nReade–keen observer, scholar, Bohemian–a man who could be both\nrough and tender, and whose boisterous ways never concealed his\nwarm heart.",
        "Reade’s school-days were Spartan in their severity. A teacher with\nthe appropriate name of Slatter set him hard tasks and caned him\nunmercifully for every shortcoming. A weaker nature would have\nbeen crushed. Reade’s was toughened, and he learned to resist pain\nand to resent wrong, so that hatred of injustice has been called\nhis dominating trait.",
        "In preparing himself for college he was singularly fortunate in\nhis tutors. One of them was Samuel Wilberforce, afterward Bishop\nof Oxford, nicknamed, from his suavity of manner, “Soapy Sam\"; and\nafterward, when Reade was studying law, his instructor was Samuel\nWarren, the author of that once famous novel, Ten Thousand a Year,\nand the creator of “Tittlebat Titmouse.”",
        "For his college at Oxford, Reade selected one of the most\nbeautiful and ancient–Magdalen–which he entered, securing what\nis known as a demyship. Reade won his demyship by an extraordinary\naccident. Always an original youth, his reading was varied and\nvaluable; but in his studies he had never tried to be minutely\naccurate in small matters. At that time every candidate was\nsupposed to be able to repeat, by heart, the “Thirty-Nine\nArticles.” Reade had no taste for memorizing; and out of the whole\nthirty-nine he had learned but three. His general examination was\ngood, though not brilliant. When he came to be questioned orally,\nthe examiner, by a chance that would not occur once in a million\ntimes, asked the candidate to repeat these very articles. Reade\nrattled them off with the greatest glibness, and produced so\nfavorable an impression that he was let go without any further\nquestioning.",
        "It must be added that his English essay was original, and this\nalso helped him; but had it not been for the other great piece of\nluck he would, in Oxford phrase, have been “completely gulfed.” As\nit was, however, he was placed as highly as the young men who were\nafterward known as Cardinal Newman and Sir Robert Lowe (Lord\nSherbrooke).",
        "At the age of twenty-one, Reade obtained a fellowship, which\nentitled him to an income so long as he remained unmarried. It is\nnecessary to consider the significance of this when we look at his\nsubsequent career. The fellowship at Magdalen was worth, at the\noutset, about twelve hundred dollars annually, and it gave him\npossession of a suite of rooms free of any charge. He likewise\nsecured a Vinerian fellowship in law, to which was attached an\nincome of four hundred dollars. As time went on, the value of the\nfirst fellowship increased until it was worth twenty-five hundred\ndollars. Therefore, as with many Oxford men of his time, Charles\nReade, who had no other fortune, was placed in this position–if he\nrefrained from marrying, he had a home and a moderate income for\nlife, without any duties whatsoever. If he married, he must give\nup his income and his comfortable apartments, and go out into the\nworld and struggle for existence.",
        "There was the further temptation that the possession of his\nfellowship did not even necessitate his living at Oxford. He might\nspend his time in London, or even outside of England, knowing that\nhis chambers at Magdalen were kept in order for him, as a resting-\nplace to which he might return whenever he chose.",
        "Reade remained a while at Oxford, studying books and men–\nespecially the latter. He was a great favorite with the\nundergraduates, though less so with the dons. He loved the boat-\nraces on the river; he was a prodigious cricket-player, and one of\nthe best bowlers of his time. He utterly refused to put on any of\nthe academic dignity which his associates affected. He wore loud\nclothes. His flaring scarfs were viewed as being almost\nscandalous, very much as Longfellow’s parti-colored waistcoats\nwere regarded when he first came to Harvard as a professor.",
        "Charles Reade pushed originality to eccentricity. He had a passion\nfor violins, and ran himself into debt because he bought so many\nand such good ones. Once, when visiting his father’s house at\nIpsden, he shocked the punctilious old gentleman by dancing on the\ndining-table to the accompaniment of a fiddle, which he scraped\ndelightedly. Dancing, indeed, was another of his diversions, and,\nin spite of the fact that he was a fellow of Magdalen and a D.C.L.\nof Oxford, he was always ready to caper and to display the new\nsteps.",
        "In the course of time, he went up to London; and at once plunged\ninto the seething tide of the metropolis. He made friends far and\nwide, and in every class and station–among authors and\npoliticians, bishops and bargees, artists and musicians. Charles\nReade learned much from all of them, and all of them were fond of\nhim.",
        "But it was the theater that interested him most. Nothing else\nseemed to him quite so fine as to be a successful writer for the\nstage. He viewed the drama with all the reverence of an ancient\nGreek. On his tombstone he caused himself to be described as\n\"Dramatist, novelist, journalist.”",
        "“Dramatist” he put first of all, even after long experience had\nshown him that his greatest power lay in writing novels. But in\nthis early period he still hoped for fame upon the stage.",
        "It was not a fortunate moment for dramatic writers. Plays were\nbought outright by the managers, who were afraid to risk any\nconsiderable sum, and were very shy about risking anything at all.\nThe system had not yet been established according to which an\nauthor receives a share of the money taken at the box-office.\nConsequently, Reade had little or no financial success. He adapted\nseveral pieces from the French, for which he was paid a few bank-\nnotes. “Masks and Faces” got a hearing, and drew large audiences,\nbut Reade had sold it for a paltry sum; and he shared the honors\nof its authorship with Tom Taylor, who was then much better known.",
        "Such was the situation. Reade was personally liked, but his plays\nwere almost all rejected. He lived somewhat extravagantly and ran\ninto debt, though not very deeply. He had a play entitled\n\"Christie Johnstone,” which he believed to be a great one, though\nno manager would venture to produce it. Reade, brooding, grew thin\nand melancholy. Finally, he decided that he would go to a leading\nactress at one of the principal theaters and try to interest her\nin his rejected play. The actress he had in mind was Laura\nSeymour, then appearing at the Haymarket under the management of\nBuckstone; and this visit proved to be the turning-point in\nReade’s whole life.",
        "Laura Seymour was the daughter of a surgeon at Bath–a man in\nlarge practise and with a good income, every penny of which he\nspent. His family lived in lavish style; but one morning, after he\nhad sat up all night playing cards, his little daughter found him\nin the dining-room, stone dead. After his funeral it appeared that\nhe had left no provision for his family. A friend of his–a Jewish\ngentleman of Portuguese extraction–showed much kindness to the\nchildren, settling their affairs and leaving them with some money\nin the bank; but, of course, something must be done.",
        "The two daughters removed to London, and at a very early age Laura\nhad made for herself a place in the dramatic world, taking small\nparts at first, but rising so rapidly that in her fifteenth year\nshe was cast for the part of Juliet. As an actress she led a life\nof strange vicissitudes. At one time she would be pinched by\npoverty, and at another time she would be well supplied with\nmoney, which slipped through her fingers like water. She was a\ntrue Bohemian, a happy-go-lucky type of the actors of her time.",
        "From all accounts, she was never very beautiful; but she had an\ninstinct for strange, yet effective, costumes, which attracted\nmuch attention. She has been described as “a fluttering, buoyant,\ngorgeous little butterfly.” Many were drawn to her. She was\ncareless of what she did, and her name was not untouched with\nscandal. But she lived through it all, and emerged a clever,\nsympathetic woman of wide experience, both on the stage and off\nit.",
        "One of her admirers–an elderly gentleman named Seymour–came to\nher one day when she was in much need of money, and told her that\nhe had just deposited a thousand pounds to her credit at the bank.\nHaving said this, he left the room precipitately. It was the\nbeginning of a sort of courtship; and after a while she married\nhim. Her feeling toward him was one of gratitude. There was no\nsentiment about it; but she made him a good wife, and gave no\nfurther cause for gossip.",
        "Such was the woman whom Charles Reade now approached with the\nrequest that she would let him read to her a portion of his play.\nHe had seen her act, and he honestly believed her to be a dramatic\ngenius of the first order. Few others shared this belief; but she\nwas generally thought of as a competent, though by no means\nbrilliant, actress. Reade admired her extremely, so that at the\nvery thought of speaking with her his emotions almost choked him.",
        "In answer to a note, she sent word that he might call at her\nhouse. He was at this time (1849) in his thirty-eighth year. The\nlady was a little older, and had lost something of her youthful\ncharm; yet, when Reade was ushered into her drawing-room, she\nseemed to him the most graceful and accomplished woman whom he had\never met.",
        "She took his measure, or she thought she took it, at a glance.\nHere was one of those would-be playwrights who live only to\ntorment managers and actresses. His face was thin, from which she\ninferred that he was probably half starved. His bashfulness led\nher to suppose that he was an inexperienced youth. Little did she\nimagine that he was the son of a landed proprietor, a fellow of\none of Oxford’s noblest colleges, and one with friends far higher\nin the world than herself. Though she thought so little of him,\nand quite expected to be bored, she settled herself in a soft\narmchair to listen. The unsuccessful playwright read to her a\nscene or two from his still unfinished drama. She heard him\npatiently, noting the cultivated accent of his voice, which proved\nto her that he was at least a gentleman. When he had finished, she\nsaid:",
        "“Yes, that’s good! The plot is excellent.” Then she laughed a sort\nof stage laugh, and remarked lightly: “Why don’t you turn it into\na novel?”",
        "Reade was stung to the quick. Nothing that she could have said\nwould have hurt him more. Novels he despised; and here was this\nwoman, the queen of the English stage, as he regarded her,\nlaughing at his drama and telling him to make a novel of it. He\nrose and bowed.",
        "“I am trespassing on your time,” he said; and, after barely\ntouching the fingers of her outstretched hand, he left the room\nabruptly.",
        "The woman knew men very well, though she scarcely knew Charles\nReade. Something in his melancholy and something in his manner\nstirred her heart. It was not a heart that responded to emotions\nreadily, but it was a very good-natured heart. Her explanation of\nReade’s appearance led her to think that he was very poor. If she\nhad not much tact, she had an abundant store of sympathy; and so\nshe sat down and wrote a very blundering but kindly letter, in\nwhich she enclosed a five-pound note.",
        "Reade subsequently described his feelings on receiving this letter\nwith its bank-note. He said:",
        "“I, who had been vice-president of Magdalen–I, who flattered\nmyself I was coming to the fore as a dramatist–to have a five-\npound note flung at my head, like a ticket for soup to a pauper,\nor a bone to a dog, and by an actress, too! Yet she said my\nreading was admirable; and, after all, there is much virtue in a\nfive-pound note. Anyhow, it showed the writer had a good heart.”",
        "The more he thought of her and of the incident, the more comforted\nhe was. He called on her the next day without making an\nappointment; and when she received him, he had the five-pound note\nfluttering in his hand.",
        "She started to speak, but he interrupted her.",
        "“No,” he said, “that is not what I wanted from you. I wanted\nsympathy, and you have unintentionally supplied it.”",
        "Then this man, whom she had regarded as half starved, presented\nher with an enormous bunch of hothouse grapes, and the two sat\ndown and ate them together, thus beginning a friendship which\nended only with Laura Seymour’s death.",
        "Oddly enough, Mrs. Seymour’s suggestion that Reade should make a\nstory of his play was a suggestion which he actually followed. It\nwas to her guidance and sympathy that the world owes the great\nnovels which he afterward composed. If he succeeded on the stage\nat all, it was not merely in “Masks and Faces,” but in his\npowerful dramatization of Zola’s novel, L’Assommoir, under the\ntitle “Drink,” in which the late Charles Warner thrilled and\nhorrified great audiences all over the English-speaking world. Had\nReade never known Laura Seymour, he might never have written so\nstrong a drama.",
        "The mystery of Reade’s relations with this woman can never be\ndefinitely cleared up. Her husband, Mr. Seymour, died not long\nafter she and Reade became acquainted. Then Reade and several\nfriends, both men and women, took a house together; and Laura\nSeymour, now a clever manager and amiable hostess, looked after\nall the practical affairs of the establishment. One by one, the\nothers fell away, through death or by removal, until at last these\ntwo were left alone. Then Reade, unable to give up the\ncompanionship which meant so much to him, vowed that she must\nstill remain and care for him. He leased a house in Sloane Street,\nwhich he has himself described in his novel A Terrible Temptation.\nIt is the chapter wherein Reade also draws his own portrait in the\ncharacter of Francis Bolfe:",
        "The room was rather long, low, and nondescript; scarlet flock\npaper; curtains and sofas, green Utrecht velvet; woodwork and\npillars, white and gold; two windows looking on the street; at the\nother end folding-doors, with scarcely any woodwork, all plate\nglass, but partly hidden by heavy curtains of the same color and\nmaterial as the others.",
        "At last a bell rang; the maid came in and invited Lady Bassett to\nfollow her. She opened the glass folding-doors and took them into\na small conservatory, walled like a grotto, with ferns sprouting\nout of rocky fissures, and spars sparkling, water dripping. Then\nshe opened two more glass folding-doors, and ushered them into an\nempty room, the like of which Lady Bassett had never seen; it was\nlarge in itself, and multiplied tenfold by great mirrors from\nfloor to ceiling, with no frames but a narrow oak beading;\nopposite her, on entering, was a bay window, all plate glass, the\ncentral panes of which opened, like doors, upon a pretty little\ngarden that glowed with color, and was backed by fine trees\nbelonging to the nation; for this garden ran up to the wall of\nHyde Park.",
        "The numerous and large mirrors all down to the ground laid hold of\nthe garden and the flowers, and by double and treble reflection\nfilled the room with delightful nooks of verdure and color.",
        "Here are the words in which Reade describes himself as he looked\nwhen between fifty and sixty years of age:",
        "He looked neither like a poet nor a drudge, but a great fat\ncountry farmer. He was rather tall, very portly, smallish head,\ncommonplace features, mild brown eye not very bright, short beard,\nand wore a suit of tweed all one color.",
        "Such was the house and such was the man over both of which Laura\nSeymour held sway until her death in 1879. What must be thought of\ntheir relations? She herself once said to Mr. John Coleman:",
        "“As for our positions–his and mine–we are partners, nothing\nmore. He has his bank-account, and I have mine. He is master of\nhis fellowship and his rooms at Oxford, and I am mistress of this\nhouse, but not his mistress! Oh, dear, no!”",
        "At another time, long after Mr. Seymour’s death, she said to an\nintimate friend:",
        "“I hope Mr. Reade will never ask me to marry him, for I should\ncertainly refuse the offer.”",
        "There was no reason why he should not have made this offer,\nbecause his Oxford fellowship ceased to be important to him after\nhe had won fame as a novelist. Publishers paid him large sums for\neverything he wrote. His debts were all paid off, and his income\nwas assured. Yet he never spoke of marriage, and he always\nintroduced his friend as “the lady who keeps my house for me.”",
        "As such, he invited his friends to meet her, and as such, she even\naccompanied him to Oxford. There was no concealment, and\napparently there was nothing to conceal. Their manner toward each\nother was that of congenial friends. Mrs. Seymour, in fact, might\nwell have been described as “a good fellow.” Sometimes she\nreferred to him as “the doctor,” and sometimes by the nickname\n\"Charlie.” He, on his side, often spoke of her by her last name as\n\"Seymour,” precisely as if she had been a man. One of his\nrelatives rather acutely remarked about her that she was not a\nwoman of sentiment at all, but had a genius for friendship; and\nthat she probably could not have really loved any man at all.",
        "This is, perhaps, the explanation of their intimacy. If so, it is\na very remarkable instance of Platonic friendship. It is certain\nthat, after she met Reade, Mrs. Seymour never cared for any other\nman. It is no less certain that he never cared for any other\nwoman. When she died, five years before his death, his life became\na burden to him. It was then that he used to speak of her as “my\nlost darling” and “my dove.” He directed that they should be\nburied side by side in Willesden churchyard. Over the monument\nwhich commemorates them both, he caused to be inscribed, in\naddition to an epitaph for himself, the following tribute to his\nfriend. One should read it and accept the touching words as\nanswering every question that may be asked:",
        "Here lies the great heart of Laura Seymour, a brilliant artist, a\nhumble Christian, a charitable woman, a loving daughter, sister,\nand friend, who lived for others from her childhood. Tenderly\npitiful to all God’s creatures–even to some that are frequently\ndestroyed or neglected–she wiped away the tears from many faces,\nhelping the poor with her savings and the sorrowful with her\nearnest pity. When the eye saw her it blessed her, for her face\nwas sunshine, her voice was melody, and her heart was sympathy.",
        "This grave was made for her and for himself by Charles Reade,\nwhose wise counselor, loyal ally, and bosom friend she was for\ntwenty-four years, and who mourns her all his days.",
