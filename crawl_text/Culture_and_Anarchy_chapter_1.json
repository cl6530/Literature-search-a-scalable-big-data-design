        "[Culture and Anarchy: An Essay in Political and Social Criticism (1869)]",
        "[iii] My foremost design in writing this Preface is to address a word\nof exhortation to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.  In\nthe essay which follows, the reader will often find Bishop Wilson\nquoted.  To me and to the members of the Society for Promoting\nChristian Knowledge his name and writings are still, no doubt,\nfamiliar; but the world is fast going away from old-fashioned people\nof his sort, and I learnt with consternation lately from a brilliant\nand distinguished votary of the natural sciences, that he had never\nso much as heard of Bishop Wilson, and that he imagined me to have\ninvented him.  At a moment when the Courts of Law have just taken off\nthe embargo from the recreative religion furnished on Sundays by my\ngifted acquaintance and others, and when St. Martin’s Hall [iv] and\nthe Alhambra will soon be beginning again to resound with their\npulpit-eloquence, it distresses one to think that the new lights\nshould not only have, in general, a very low opinion of the preachers\nof the old religion, but that they should have it without knowing the\nbest that these preachers can do.  And that they are in this case is\nowing in part, certainly, to the negligence of the Christian\nKnowledge Society.  In old times they used to print and spread abroad\nBishop Wilson’s Maxims of Piety and Christianity; the copy of this\nwork which I use is one of their publications, bearing their imprint,\nand bound in the well-known brown calf which they made familiar to\nour childhood; but the date of my copy is 1812.  I know of no copy\nbesides, and I believe the work is no longer one of those printed and\ncirculated by the Society.  Hence the error, flattering, I own, to me\npersonally, yet in itself to be regretted, of the distinguished\nphysicist already mentioned.",
        "But Bishop Wilson’s Maxims deserve to be circulated as a religious\nbook, not only by comparison with the cartloads of rubbish circulated\nat present under this designation, but for their own sake, and even\nby comparison with the other works of the same [v] author.  Over the\nfar better known Sacra Privata they have this advantage, that they\nwere prepared by him for his own private use, while the Sacra Privata\nwere prepared by him for the use of the public.  The Maxims were\nnever meant to be printed, and have on that account, like a work of,\ndoubtless, far deeper emotion and power, the Meditations of Marcus\nAurelius, something peculiarly sincere and first-hand about them.\nSome of the best things from the Maxims have passed into the Sacra\nPrivata; still, in the Maxims, we have them as they first arose; and\nwhereas, too, in the Sacra Privata the writer speaks very often as\none of the clergy, and as addressing the clergy, in the Maxims he\nalmost always speaks solely as a man.  I am not saying a word against\nthe Sacra Privata, for which I have the highest respect; only the\nMaxims seem to me a better and a more edifying book still.  They\nshould be read, as Joubert says Nicole should be read, with a direct\naim at practice.  The reader will leave on one side things which,\nfrom the change of time and from the changed point of view which the\nchange of time inevitably brings with it, no longer suit him; enough\n[vi] will remain to serve as a sample of the very best, perhaps,\nwhich our nation and race can do in the way of religious writing.\nMonsieur Michelet makes it a reproach to us that, in all the doubt as\nto the real author of the Imitation, no one has ever dreamed of\nascribing that work to an Englishman.  It is true, the Imitation\ncould not well have been written by an Englishman; the religious\ndelicacy and the profound asceticism of that admirable book are\nhardly in our nature.  This would be more of a reproach to us if in\npoetry, which requires, no less than religion, a true delicacy of\nspiritual perception, our race had not done such great things; and if\nthe Imitation, exquisite as it is, did not, as I have elsewhere\nremarked, belong to a class of works in which the perfect balance of\nhuman nature is lost, and which have therefore, as spiritual\nproductions, in their contents something excessive and morbid, in\ntheir form something not thoroughly sound.  On a lower range than the\nImitation, and awakening in our nature chords less poetical and\ndelicate, the Maxims of Bishop Wilson are, as a religious work, far\nmore solid.  To the most sincere ardour and unction, Bishop Wilson\nunites, in these Maxims, that downright honesty [vii] and plain good\nsense which our English race has so powerfully applied to the divine\nimpossibilities of religion; by which it has brought religion so much\ninto practical life, and has done its allotted part in promoting upon\nearth the kingdom of God.  But with ardour and unction religion, as\nwe all know, may still be fanatical; with honesty and good sense, it\nmay still be prosaic; and the fruit of honesty and good sense united\nwith ardour and unction is often only a prosaic religion held\nfanatically.  Bishop Wilson’s excellence lies in a balance of the\nfour qualities, and in a fulness and perfection of them, which makes\nthis untoward result impossible; his unction is so perfect, and in\nsuch happy alliance with his good sense, that it becomes tenderness\nand fervent charity; his good sense is so perfect and in such happy\nalliance with his unction, that it becomes moderation and insight.\nWhile, therefore, the type of religion exhibited in his Maxims is\nEnglish, it is yet a type of a far higher kind than is in general\nreached by Bishop Wilson’s countrymen; and yet, being English, it is\npossible and attainable for them.  And so I conclude as I began, by\nsaying that a work of this sort is one which the Society for\nPromoting Christian [viii] Knowledge should not suffer to remain out\nof print or out of currency.",
        "To pass now to the matters canvassed in the following essay.  The\nwhole scope of the essay is to recommend culture as the great help\nout of our present difficulties; culture being a pursuit of our total\nperfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most\nconcern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world,\nand, through this knowledge, turning a stream of fresh and free\nthought upon our stock notions and habits, which we now follow\nstaunchly but mechanically, vainly imagining that there is a virtue\nin following them staunchly which makes up for the mischief of\nfollowing them mechanically.  This, and this alone, is the scope of\nthe following essay.  I say again here, what I have said in the pages\nwhich follow, that from the faults and weaknesses of bookmen a notion\nof something bookish, pedantic, and futile has got itself more or\nless connected with the word culture, and that it is a pity we cannot\nuse a word more perfectly free from all shadow of reproach.  And yet,\nfutile as are many bookmen, and helpless as books and reading often\nprove for bringing nearer to perfection those who [ix] use them, one\nmust, I think, be struck more and more, the longer one lives, to find\nhow much, in our present society, a man’s life of each day depends\nfor its solidity and value on whether he reads during that day, and,\nfar more still, on what he reads during it.  More and more he who\nexamines himself will find the difference it makes to him, at the end\nof any given day, whether or no he has pursued his avocations\nthroughout it without reading at all; and whether or no, having read\nsomething, he has read the newspapers only.  This, however, is a\nmatter for each man’s private conscience and experience.  If a man\nwithout books or reading, or reading nothing but his letters and the\nnewspapers, gets nevertheless a fresh and free play of the best\nthoughts upon his stock notions and habits, he has got culture.  He\nhas got that for which we prize and recommend culture; he has got\nthat which at the present moment we seek culture that it may give us.\nThis inward operation is the very life and essence of culture, as we\nconceive it.",
        "Nevertheless, it is not easy so to frame one’s discourse concerning\nthe operation of culture, as to avoid giving frequent occasion to a\nmisunderstanding whereby the essential inwardness of the [x]\noperation is lost sight of.  We are supposed, when we criticise by\nthe help of culture some imperfect doing or other, to have in our eye\nsome well-known rival plan of doing, which we want to serve and\nrecommend.  Thus, for instance, because I have freely pointed out the\ndangers and inconveniences to which our literature is exposed in the\nabsence of any centre of taste and authority like the French Academy,\nit is constantly said that I want to introduce here in England an\ninstitution like the French Academy.  I have indeed expressly\ndeclared that I wanted no such thing; but let us notice how it is\njust our worship of machinery, and of external doing, which leads to\nthis charge being brought; and how the inwardness of culture makes us\nseize, for watching and cure, the faults to which our want of an\nAcademy inclines us, and yet prevents us from trusting to an arm of\nflesh, as the Puritans say,–from blindly flying to this outward\nmachinery of an Academy, in order to help ourselves.  For the very\nsame culture and free inward play of thought which shows us how the\nCorinthian style, or the whimsies about the One Primeval Language,\nare generated and strengthened in the absence of an [xi] Academy,\nshows us, too, how little any Academy, such as we should be likely to\nget, would cure them.  Every one who knows the characteristics of our\nnational life, and the tendencies so fully discussed in the following\npages, knows exactly what an English Academy would be like.  One can\nsee the happy family in one’s mind’s eye as distinctly as if it was\nalready constituted.  Lord Stanhope, the Bishop of Oxford, Mr.\nGladstone, the Dean of Westminster, Mr. Froude, Mr. Henry Reeve,–\neverything which is influential, accomplished, and distinguished; and\nthen, some fine morning, a dissatisfaction of the public mind with\nthis brilliant and select coterie, a flight of Corinthian leading\narticles, and an irruption of Mr. G.  A.  Sala.  Clearly, this is not\nwhat will do us good.  The very same faults,–the want of\nsensitiveness of intellectual conscience, the disbelief in right\nreason, the dislike of authority,–which have hindered our having an\nAcademy and have worked injuriously in our literature, would also\nhinder us from making our Academy, if we established it, one which\nwould really correct them.  And culture, which shows us truly the\nfaults, shows us this also just as truly.",
        "[xii] It is by a like sort of misunderstanding, again, that Mr. Oscar\nBrowning, one of the assistant-masters at Eton, takes up in the\nQuarterly Review the cudgels for Eton, as if I had attacked Eton,\nbecause I have said, in a book about foreign schools, that a man may\nwell prefer to teach his three or four hours a day without keeping a\nboarding-house; and that there are great dangers in cramming little\nboys of eight or ten and making them compete for an object of great\nvalue to their parents; and, again, that the manufacture and supply\nof school-books, in England, much needs regulation by some competent\nauthority.  Mr. Oscar Browning gives us to understand that at Eton he\nand others, with perfect satisfaction to themselves and the public,\ncombine the functions of teaching and of keeping a boarding-house;\nthat he knows excellent men (and, indeed, well he may, for a brother\nof his own, I am told, is one of the best of them,) engaged in\npreparing little boys for competitive examinations, and that the\nresult, as tested at Eton, gives perfect satisfaction.  And as to\nschool-books he adds, finally, that Dr.  William Smith, the learned\nand distinguished editor of the Quarterly Review, is, as we all know,\n[xiii] the compiler of school-books meritorious and many.  This is\nwhat Mr. Oscar Browning gives us to understand in the Quarterly\nReview, and it is impossible not to read with pleasure what he says.\nFor what can give a finer example of that frankness and manly self-\nconfidence which our great public schools, and none of them so much\nas Eton, are supposed to inspire, of that buoyant ease in holding up\none’s head, speaking out what is in one’s mind, and flinging off all\nsheepishness and awkwardness, than to see an Eton assistant-master\noffering in fact himself as evidence that to combine boarding-house-\nkeeping with teaching is a good thing, and his brother as evidence\nthat to train and race little boys for competitive examinations is a\ngood thing?  Nay, and one sees that this frank-hearted Eton self-\nconfidence is contagious; for has not Mr. Oscar Browning managed to\nfire Dr.  William Smith (himself, no doubt, the modestest man alive,\nand never trained at Eton) with the same spirit, and made him insert\nin his own Review a puff, so to speak, of his own school-books,\ndeclaring that they are (as they are) meritorious and many?\nNevertheless, Mr. Oscar Browning is wrong in [xiv] thinking that I\nwished to run down Eton; and his repetition on behalf of Eton, with\nthis idea in his head, of the strains of his heroic ancestor,\nMalvina’s Oscar, as they are recorded by the family poet, Ossian, is\nunnecessary.  “The wild boar rushes over their tombs, but he does not\ndisturb their repose.  They still love the sport of their youth, and\nmount the wind with joy.” All I meant to say was, that there were\nunpleasantnesses in uniting the keeping a boarding-house with\nteaching, and dangers in cramming and racing little boys for\ncompetitive examinations, and charlatanism and extravagance in the\nmanufacture and supply of our school-books.  But when Mr. Oscar\nBrowning tells us that all these have been happily got rid of in his\ncase, and his brother’s case, and Dr.  William Smith’s case, then I\nsay that this is just what I wish, and I hope other people will\nfollow their good example.  All I seek is that such blemishes should\nnot through any negligence, self-love, or want of due self-\nexamination, be suffered to continue.",
        "Natural, as we have said, the sort of misunderstanding just noticed\nis; yet our usefulness depends upon our being able to clear it away,\nand to convince [xv] those who mechanically serve some stock notion\nor operation, and thereby go astray, that it is not culture’s work or\naim to give the victory to some rival fetish, but simply to turn a\nfree and fresh stream of thought upon the whole matter in question.\nIn a thing of more immediate interest, just now, than either of the\ntwo we have mentioned, the like misunderstanding prevails; and until\nit is dissipated, culture can do no good work in the matter.  When we\ncriticise the present operation of disestablishing the Irish Church,\nnot by the power of reason and justice, but by the power of the\nantipathy of the Protestant Nonconformists, English and Scotch, to\nestablishments, we are charged with being dreamers of dreams, which\nthe national will has rudely shattered, for endowing the religious\nsects all round; or we are called enemies of the Nonconformists,\nblind partisans of the Anglican Establishment.  More than a few words\nwe must give to showing how erroneous are these charges; because if\nthey were true, we should be actually subverting our own design, and\nplaying false to that culture which it is our very purpose to\nrecommend.",
        "Certainly we are no enemies of the Nonconformists; [xvi] for, on the\ncontrary, what we aim at is their perfection.  Culture, which is the\nstudy of perfection, leads us, as we in the following pages have\nshown, to conceive of true human perfection as a harmonious\nperfection, developing all sides of our humanity; and as a general\nperfection, developing all parts of our society.  For if one member\nsuffer, the other members must suffer with it; and the fewer there\nare that follow the true way of salvation the harder that way is to\nfind.  And while the Nonconformists, the successors and\nrepresentatives of the Puritans, and like them staunchly walking by\nthe best light they have, make a large part of what is strongest and\nmost serious in this nation and therefore attract our respect and\ninterest, yet all that, in what follows, is said about Hebraism and\nHellenism, has for its main result to show how our Puritans, ancient\nand modern, have not enough added to their care for walking staunchly\nby the best light they have, a care that that light be not darkness;\nhow they have developed one side of their humanity at the expense of\nall others, and have become incomplete and mutilated men in\nconsequence.  Thus falling short of harmonious [xvii] perfection,\nthey fail to follow the true way of salvation.  Therefore that way is\nmade the harder for others to find, general perfection is put further\noff out of our reach, and the confusion and perplexity in which our\nsociety now labours is increased by the Nonconformists rather than\ndiminished by them.  So while we praise and esteem the zeal of the\nNonconformists in walking staunchly by the best light they have, and\ndesire to take no whit from it, we seek to add to this what we call\nsweetness and light, and develope their full humanity more perfectly;\nand to seek this is certainly not to be the enemy of the\nNonconformists.",
        "But now, with these ideas in our head, we come across the present\noperation for disestablishing the Irish Church by the power of the\nNonconformists’ antipathy to religious establishments and endowments.\nAnd we see Liberal statesmen, for whose purpose this antipathy\nhappens to be convenient, flattering it all they can; saying that\nthough they have no intention of laying hands on an Establishment\nwhich is efficient and popular, like the Anglican Establishment here\nin England, yet it is in the abstract a fine and good thing that\nreligion should [xviii] be left to the voluntary support of its\npromoters, and should thus gain in energy and independence; and Mr.\nGladstone has no words strong enough to express his admiration of the\nrefusal of State-aid by the Irish Roman Catholics, who have never yet\nbeen seriously asked to accept it, but who would a good deal\nembarrass him if they demanded it.  And we see philosophical\npoliticians, with a turn for swimming with the stream, like Mr.\nBaxter or Mr. Charles Buxton, and philosophical divines with the same\nturn, like the Dean of Canterbury, seeking to give a sort of grand\nstamp of generality and solemnity to this antipathy of the\nNonconformists, and to dress it out as a law of human progress in the\nfuture.  Now, nothing can be pleasanter than swimming with the\nstream; and we might gladly, if we could, try in our unsystematic way\nto help Mr. Baxter, and Mr. Charles Buxton, and the Dean of\nCanterbury, in their labours at once philosophical and popular.  But\nwe have got fixed in our minds that a more full and harmonious\ndevelopment of their humanity is what the Nonconformists most want,\nthat narrowness, one-sidedness, and incompleteness is what they most\nsuffer from; [xix] in a word, that in what we call provinciality they\nabound, but in what we may call totality they fall short.",
        "And they fall short more than the members of Establishments.  The\ngreat works by which, not only in literature, art, and science\ngenerally, but in religion itself, the human spirit has manifested\nits approaches to totality, and a full, harmonious perfection, and by\nwhich it stimulates and helps forward the world’s general perfection,\ncome, not from Nonconformists, but from men who either belong to\nEstablishments or have been trained in them.  A Nonconformist\nminister, the Rev. Edward White, who has lately written a temperate\nand well-reasoned pamphlet against Church Establishments, says that\n“the unendowed and unestablished communities of England exert full as\nmuch moral and ennobling influence upon the conduct of statesmen as\nthat Church which is both established and endowed.” That depends upon\nwhat one means by moral and ennobling influence.  The believer in\nmachinery may think that to get a Government to abolish Church-rates\nor to legalise marriage with a deceased wife’s sister is to exert a\nmoral and ennobling influence [xx] upon Government.  But a lover of\nperfection, who looks to inward ripeness for the true springs of\nconduct, will surely think that as Shakspeare has done more for the\ninward ripeness of our statesmen than Dr.  Watts, and has, therefore,\ndone more to moralise and ennoble them, so an Establishment which has\nproduced Hooker, Barrow, Butler, has done more to moralise and\nennoble English statesmen and their conduct than communities which\nhave produced the Nonconformist divines.  The fruitful men of English\nPuritanism and Nonconformity are men who were trained within the pale\nof the Establishment,–Milton, Baxter, Wesley.  A generation or two\noutside the Establishment, and Puritanism produces men of national\nmark no more.  With the same doctrine and discipline, men of national\nmark are produced in Scotland; but in an Establishment.  With the\nsame doctrine and discipline, men of national and even European mark\nare produced in Germany, Switzerland, France; but in Establishments.\nOnly two religious disciplines seem exempted; or comparatively\nexempted, from the operation of the law which seems to forbid the\nrearing, outside of national establishments, of men of the [xxi]\nhighest spiritual significance.  These two are the Roman Catholic and\nthe Jewish.  And these, both of them, rest on Establishments, which,\nthough not indeed national, are cosmopolitan; and perhaps here, what\nthe individual man does not lose by these conditions of his rearing,\nthe citizen, and the State of which he is a citizen, loses.",
        "What, now, can be the reason of this undeniable provincialism of the\nEnglish Puritans and Protestant Nonconformists, a provincialism which\nhas two main types,–a bitter type and a smug type,–but which in\nboth its types is vulgarising, and thwarts the full perfection of our\nhumanity?  Men of genius and character are born and reared in this\nmedium as in any other.  From the faults of the mass such men will\nalways be comparatively free, and they will always excite our\ninterest; yet in this medium they seem to have a special difficulty\nin breaking through what bounds them, and in developing their\ntotality.  Surely the reason is, that the Nonconformist is not in\ncontact with the main current of national life, like the member of an\nEstablishment.  In a matter of such deep and vital concern as\nreligion, this separation from the main current of the national life\nhas [xxii] peculiar importance.  In the following essay we have\ndiscussed at length the tendency in us to Hebraise, as we call it;\nthat is, to sacrifice all other sides of our being to the religious\nside.  This tendency has its cause in the divine beauty and grandeur\nof religion, and bears affecting testimony to them; but we have seen\nthat it has dangers for us, we have seen that it leads to a narrow\nand twisted growth of our religious side itself, and to a failure in\nperfection.  But if we tend to Hebraise even in an Establishment,\nwith the main current of national life flowing round us, and\nreminding us in all ways of the variety and fulness of human\nexistence,–by a Church which is historical as the State itself is\nhistorical, and whose order, ceremonies, and monuments reach, like\nthose of the State, far beyond any fancies and devisings of ours, and\nby institutions such as the Universities, formed to defend and\nadvance that very culture and many-sided development which it is the\ndanger of Hebraising to make us neglect,–how much more must we tend\nto Hebraise when we lack these preventives.  One may say that to be\nreared a member of an Establishment is in itself a lesson of\nreligious moderation, and a help towards [xxiii] culture and\nharmonious perfection.  Instead of battling for his own private forms\nfor expressing the inexpressible and defining the undefinable, a man\ntakes those which have commended themselves most to the religious\nlife of his nation; and while he may be sure that within those forms\nthe religious side of his own nature may find its satisfaction, he\nhas leisure and composure to satisfy other sides of his nature as\nwell.",
        "But with the member of a Nonconforming or self-made religious\ncommunity how different!  The sectary’s eigene grosse Erfindungen, as\nGoethe calls them,–the precious discoveries of himself and his\nfriends for expressing the inexpressible and defining the undefinable\nin peculiar forms of their own, cannot but, as he has voluntarily\nchosen them, and is personally responsible for them, fill his whole\nmind.  He is zealous to do battle for them and affirm them, for in\naffirming them he affirms himself, and that is what we all like.\nOther sides of his being are thus neglected, because the religious\nside, always tending in every serious man to predominance over our\nother spiritual sides, is in him made quite absorbing and tyrannous\nby [xxiv] the condition of self-assertion and challenge which he has\nchosen for himself.  And just what is not essential in religion he\ncomes to mistake for essential, and a thousand times the more readily\nbecause he has chosen it of himself; and religious activity he\nfancies to consist in battling for it.  All this leaves him little\nleisure or inclination for culture; to which, besides, he has no\ngreat institutions not of his own making, like the Universities\nconnected with the national Establishment, to invite him; but only\nsuch institutions as, like the order and discipline of his religion,\nhe may have invented for himself, and invented under the sway of the\nnarrow and tyrannous notions of religion fostered in him as we have\nseen.  Thus, while a national Establishment of religion favours\ntotality, hole-and-corner forms of religion (to use an expressive\npopular word) inevitably favour provincialism.",
        "But the Nonconformists, and many of our Liberal friends along with\nthem, have a plausible plan for getting rid of this provincialism,\nif, as they can hardly quite deny, it exists.  “Let us all be in the\nsame boat,” they cry; “open the Universities to everybody, and let\nthere be no establishment of [xxv] religion at all!” Open the\nUniversities by all means; but, as to the second point about\nestablishment, let us sift the proposal a little.  It does seem at\nfirst a little like that proposal of the fox, who had lost his own\ntail, to put all the other foxes in the same boat by a general\ncutting off of tails; and we know that moralists have decided that\nthe right course here was, not to adopt this plausible suggestion,\nand cut off tails all round, but rather that the other foxes should\nkeep their tails, and that the fox without a tail should get one.\nAnd so we might be inclined to urge that, to cure the evil of the\nNonconformists’ provincialism, the right way can hardly be to\nprovincialise us all round.",
        "However, perhaps we shall not be provincialised.  For the Rev. Edward\nWhite says that probably, “when all good men alike are placed in a\ncondition of religious equality, and the whole complicated iniquity\nof Government Church patronage is swept away, more of moral and\nennobling influence than ever will be brought to bear upon the action\nof statesmen.” We already have an example of religious equality in\nour colonies.  “In the colonies,” says The Times, “we see religious\ncommunities unfettered by [xxvi] State-control, and the State\nrelieved from one of the most troublesome and irritating of\nresponsibilities.” But America is the great example alleged by those\nwho are against establishments for religion.  Our topic at this\nmoment is the influence of religious establishments on culture; and\nit is remarkable that Mr. Bright, who has taken lately to\nrepresenting himself as, above all, a promoter of reason and of the\nsimple natural truth of things, and his policy as a fostering of the\ngrowth of intelligence,–just the aims, as is well known, of culture\nalso,–Mr. Bright, in a speech at Birmingham about education, seized\non the very point which seems to concern our topic, when he said: “I\nbelieve the people of the United States have offered to the world\nmore valuable information during the last forty years than all Europe\nput together.” So America, without religious establishments, seems to\nget ahead of us all in culture and totality; and these are the cure\nfor provincialism.",
        "On the other hand, another friend of reason and the simple natural\ntruth of things, Monsieur Renan, says of America, in a book he has\nrecently published, what seems to conflict violently with [xxvii]\nwhat Mr. Bright says.  Mr. Bright affirms that, not only have the\nUnited States thus informed Europe, but they have done it without a\ngreat apparatus of higher and scientific instruction, and by dint of\nall classes in America being “sufficiently educated to be able to\nread, and to comprehend, and to think; and that, I maintain, is the\nfoundation of all subsequent progress.” And then comes Monsieur\nRenan, and says: “The sound instruction of the people is an effect of\nthe high culture of certain classes.  The countries which, like the\nUnited States, have created a considerable popular instruction\nwithout any serious higher instruction, will long have to expiate\nthis fault by their intellectual mediocrity, their vulgarity of\nmanners, their superficial spirit, their lack of general\nintelligence.\"* Now, which of these two friends of culture are we to\nbelieve?  Monsieur Renan seems more to have in his eye what we\nourselves mean by culture; [xxviii] because Mr. Bright always has in\nhis eye what he calls “a commendable interest” in politics and\npolitical agitations.  As he said only the other day at Birmingham:\n“At this moment,–in fact, I may say at every moment in the history\nof a free country,–there is nothing that is so much worth discussing\nas politics.” And he keeps repeating, with all the powers of his\nnoble oratory, the old story, how to the thoughtfulness and\nintelligence of the people of great towns we owe all our improvements\nin the last thirty years, and how these improvements have hitherto\nconsisted in Parliamentary reform, and free trade, and abolition of\nChurch rates, and so on; and how they are now about to consist in\ngetting rid of minority-members, and in introducing a free breakfast-\ntable, and in abolishing the Irish Church by the power of the\nNonconformists’ antipathy to establishments, and much more of the\nsame kind.  And though our pauperism and ignorance, and all the\nquestions which are called social, seem now to be forcing themselves\nupon his mind, yet he still goes on with his glorifying of the great\ntowns, and the Liberals, and their operations for the last thirty\nyears.  It never [xxix] seems to occur to him that the present\ntroubled state of our social life has anything to do with the thirty\nyears’ blind worship of their nostrums by himself and our Liberal\nfriends, or that it throws any doubts upon the sufficiency of this\nworship.  But he thinks what is still amiss is due to the stupidity\nof the Tories, and will be cured by the thoughtfulness and\nintelligence of the great towns, and by the Liberals going on\ngloriously with their political operations as before; or that it will\ncure itself.  So we see what Mr. Bright means by thoughtfulness and\nintelligence, and in what manner, according to him, we are to grow in\nthem.  And, no doubt, in America all classes read their newspaper and\ntake a commendable interest in politics more than here or anywhere\nelse in Europe.",
        "But, in the following essay, we have been led to doubt the\nsufficiency of all this political operating of ours, pursued\nmechanically as we pursue it; and we found that general intelligence,\nas Monsieur Renan calls it, or, in our own words, a reference of all\nour operating to a firm intelligible law of things, was just what we\nwere without, and that we were without it because we worshipped our\nmachinery [xxx] so devoutly.  Therefore, we conclude that Monsieur\nRenan, more than Mr. Bright, means by reason and intelligence the\nsame thing as we do; and when he says that America, that chosen home\nof newspapers and politics, is without general intelligence, we think\nit likely, from the circumstances of the case, that this is so; and\nthat, in culture and totality, America, instead of surpassing us all,\nfalls short.",
        "And,–to keep to our point of the influence of religious\nestablishments upon culture and a high development of our humanity,–\nwe can surely see reasons why, with all her energy and fine gifts,\nAmerica does not show more of this development, or more promise of\nthis.  In the following essay it will be seen how our society\ndistributes itself into Barbarians, Philistines, and Populace; and\nAmerica is just ourselves, with the Barbarians quite left out, and\nthe Populace nearly.  This leaves the Philistines for the great bulk\nof the nation;–a livelier sort of Philistine than ours, and with the\npressure and false ideal of our Barbarians taken away, but left all\nthe more to himself and to have his full swing!  And as we have found\nthat the strongest and most vital part of English Philistinism was\nthe [xxxi] Puritan and Hebraising middle-class, and that its\nHebraising keeps it from culture and totality, so it is notorious\nthat the people of the United States issues from this class, and\nreproduces its tendencies,–its narrow conception of man’s spiritual\nrange and of his one thing needful.  From Maine to Florida, and back\nagain, all America Hebraises.  Difficult as it is to speak of a\npeople merely from what one reads, yet that, I think, one may,\nwithout much fear of contradiction say.  I mean, when, in the United\nStates, any spiritual side in a man is wakened to activity, it is\ngenerally the religious side, and the religious side in a narrow way.\nSocial reformers go to Moses or St.  Paul for their doctrines, and\nhave no notion there is anywhere else to go to; earnest young men at\nschools and universities, instead of conceiving salvation as a\nharmonious perfection only to be won by unreservedly cultivating many\nsides in us, conceive of it in the old Puritan fashion, and fling\nthemselves ardently upon it in the old, false ways of this fashion,\nwhich we know so well, and such as Mr. Hammond, the American\nrevivalist, has lately, at Mr. Spurgeon’s Tabernacle, been refreshing\nour memory with.  Now, if America thus [xxxii] Hebraises more than\neither England or Germany, will any one deny that the absence of\nreligious establishments has much to do with it?  We have seen how\nestablishments tend to give us a sense of a historical life of the\nhuman spirit, outside and beyond our own fancies and feelings; how\nthey thus tend to suggest new sides and sympathies in us to\ncultivate; how, further, by saving us from having to invent and fight\nfor our own forms of religion, they give us leisure and calm to\nsteady our view of religion itself,–the most overpowering of\nobjects, as it is the grandest,–and to enlarge our first crude\nnotions of the one thing needful.  But, in a serious people, where\nevery one has to choose and strive for his own order and discipline\nof religion, the contention about these non-essentials occupies his\nmind, his first crude notions about the one thing needful do not get\npurged, and they invade the whole spiritual man in him, and then,\nmaking a solitude, they call it heavenly peace.",
        "I remember a Nonconformist manufacturer, in a town of the Midland\ncounties, telling me that when he first came there, some years ago,\nthe place had no Dissenters; but he had opened an Independent\n[xxxiii] chapel in it, and now Church and Dissent were pretty equally\ndivided, with sharp contests between them.  I said, that seemed a\npity.  “A pity?” cried he; “not at all!  Only think of all the zeal\nand activity which the collision calls forth!” “Ah, but, my dear\nfriend,” I answered, “only think of all the nonsense which you now\nhold quite firmly, which you would never have held if you had not\nbeen contradicting your adversary in it all these years!” The more\nserious the people, and the more prominent the religious side in it,\nthe greater is the danger of this side, if set to choose out forms\nfor itself and fight for existence, swelling and spreading till it\nswallows all other spiritual sides up, intercepts and absorbs all\nnutriment which should have gone to them, and leaves Hebraism rampant\nin us and Hellenism stamped out.",
        "Culture, and the harmonious perfection of our whole being, and what\nwe call totality, then become secondary matters; and the\ninstitutions, which should develope these, take the same narrow and\npartial view of humanity and its wants as the free religious\ncommunities take.  Just as the free churches of Mr. Beecher or\nBrother Noyes, with their provincialism [xxxiv] and want of\ncentrality, make mere Hebraisers in religion, and not perfect men, so\nthe university of Mr. Ezra Cornell, a really noble monument of his\nmunificence, yet seems to rest on a provincial misconception of what\nculture truly is, and to be calculated to produce miners, or\nengineers, or architects, not sweetness and light.",
        "And, therefore, when the Rev. Edward White asks the same kind of\nquestion about America that he has asked about England, and wants to\nknow whether, without religious establishments, as much is not done\nin America for the higher national life as is done for that life\nhere, we answer in the same way as we did before, that as much is not\ndone.  Because to enable and stir up people to read their Bible and\nthe newspapers, and to get a practical knowledge of their business,\ndoes not serve to the higher spiritual life of a nation so much as\nculture, truly conceived, serves; and a true conception of culture\nis, as Monsieur Renan’s words show, just what America fails in.",
        "To the many who think that culture, and sweetness, and light, are all\nmoonshine, this will not appear to matter much; but with us, who\nvalue [xxxv] them, and who think that we have traced much of our\npresent discomfort to the want of them, it weighs a great deal.  So\nnot only do we say that the Nonconformists have got provincialism and\nlost totality by the want of a religious establishment, but we say\nthat the very example which they bring forward to help their case\nmakes against them; and that when they triumphantly show us America\nwithout religious establishments, they only show us a whole nation\ntouched, amidst all its greatness and promise, with that\nprovincialism which it is our aim to extirpate in the English\nNonconformists.",
        "But now to evince the disinterestedness which culture, as I have\nsaid, teaches us.  We have seen the narrowness generated in\nPuritanism by its hole-and-corner organisation, and we propose to\ncure it by bringing Puritanism more into contact with the main\ncurrent of national life.  Here we are fully at one with the Dean of\nWestminster; and, indeed, he and we were trained in the same school\nto mark the narrowness of Puritanism, and to wish to cure it.  But he\nand others would give to the present Anglican Establishment a\ncharacter the most latitudinarian, as it is called, possible;\navailing themselves for this [xxxvi] purpose of the diversity of\ntendencies and doctrines which does undoubtedly exist already in the\nAnglican formularies; and they would say to the Puritans: “Come all\nof you into this liberally conceived Anglican Establishment.” But to\nsay this is hardly, perhaps, to take sufficient account of the course\nof history, or of the strength of men’s feelings in what concerns\nreligion, or of the gravity which may have come to attach itself to\npoints of religious order and discipline merely.  When the Rev.\nEdward White talks of “sweeping away the whole complicated iniquity\nof Government Church patronage,” he uses language which has been\nforced upon him by his position, but which is, as we have seen,\ndevoid of any real solidity.  But when he talks of the religious\ncommunities “which have for three hundred years contended for the\npower of the congregation in the management of their own affairs,\"\nthen he talks history; and his language has behind it, in my opinion,\nfacts which make the latitudinarianism of our Broad Churchmen quite\nillusory.  Certainly, culture will never make us think it an\nessential of religion whether we have in our Church discipline “a\npopular authority of elders,” as Hooker calls [xxxvii] it, or whether\nwe have Episcopal jurisdiction.  Certainly, Hooker himself did not\nthink it an essential; for in the dedication of his Ecclesiastical\nPolity, speaking of these questions of Church discipline which gave\noccasion to his great work, he says they are “in truth, for the\ngreatest part, such silly things, that very easiness doth make them\nhard to be disputed of in serious manner.” Hooker’s great work\nagainst the impugners of the order and discipline of the Church of\nEngland was written (and this is too indistinctly seized by many who\nread it), not because Episcopalianism is essential, but because its\nimpugners maintained that Presbyterianism is essential, and that\nEpiscopalianism is sinful.  Neither the one nor the other is either\nessential or sinful, and much may be said on behalf of both.  But\nwhat is important to be remarked is that both were in the Church of\nEngland at the Reformation, and that Presbyterianism was only\nextruded gradually.  We have mentioned Hooker, and nothing better\nillustrates what has just been asserted than the following incident\nin Hooker’s own career, which every one has read, for it is related\nin Isaac Walton’s Life of Hooker, but of which, [xxxviii] probably,\nthe significance has been fully grasped by not one-half of those who\nhave read it.",
        "Hooker was through the influence of Archbishop Whitgift appointed, in\n1585, Master of the Temple; but a great effort had just been made to\nobtain the place for a Mr. Walter Travers, well known in that day,\nthough now it is Hooker’s name which alone preserves his.  This\nTravers was then afternoon-lecturer at the Temple.  The Master whose\ndeath made the vacancy, Alvey, recommended on his deathbed Travers\nfor his successor, the society was favourable to him, and he had the\nsupport of the Lord Treasurer Burghley.  After Hooker’s appointment\nto the Mastership, Travers remained afternoon-lecturer, and combated\nin the afternoons the doctrine which Hooker preached in the mornings.\nNow, this Travers, originally a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,\nafterwards afternoon-lecturer at the Temple, recommended for the\nMastership by the foregoing Master, whose opinions, it is said,\nagreed with his, favoured by the society of the Temple, and supported\nby the Prime Minister,–this Travers was not an Episcopally ordained\nclergyman at all; he was a Presbyterian, [xxxix] a partisan of the\nGeneva church-discipline, as it was then called, and “had taken\norders,” says Walton, “by the Presbyters in Antwerp.” In another\nplace Walton speaks of his orders yet more fully:–\"He had\ndisowned,” he says, “the English Established Church and Episcopacy,\nand went to Geneva, and afterwards to Antwerp, to be ordained\nminister, as he was by Villers and Cartwright and others the heads of\na congregation there; and so came back again more confirmed for the\ndiscipline.” Villers and Cartwright are in like manner examples of\nPresbyterianism within the Church of England, which was common enough\nat that time; but perhaps nothing can better give us a lively sense\nof its presence there than this history of Travers, which is as if\nMr. Binney were now afternoon-reader at Lincoln’s Inn or the Temple,\nwere to be a candidate, favoured by the benchers and by the Prime\nMinister, for the Mastership, and were only kept out of the post by\nthe accident of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s influence with the\nQueen carrying a rival candidate.",
        "Presbyterianism, with its popular principle of the power of the\ncongregation in the management of [xl] their own affairs, was\nextruded from the Church of England, and men like Travers can no\nlonger appear in her pulpits.  Perhaps if a government like that of\nElizabeth, with secular statesmen like the Cecils, and ecclesiastical\nstatesmen like Whitgift, could have been prolonged, Presbyterianism\nmight, by a wise mixture of concession and firmness, have been\nabsorbed in the Establishment.  Lord Bolingbroke, on a matter of this\nkind a very clear-judging and impartial witness, says, in a work far\ntoo little read, his Remarks on English History:–” The measures\npursued and the temper observed in Queen Elizabeth’s time tended to\ndiminish the religious opposition by a slow, a gentle, and for that\nvery reason an effectual progression.  There was even room to hope\nthat when the first fire of the Dissenters’ zeal was passed,\nreasonable terms of union with the Established Church might be\naccepted by such of them as were not intoxicated with fanaticism.\nThese were friends to order, though they disputed about it.  If these\nfriends of Calvin’s discipline had been once incorporated with the\nEstablished Church, the remaining sectaries would have been of little\nmoment, either for numbers or [xli] reputation; and the very means\nwhich were proper to gain these friends, were likewise the most\neffectual to hinder the increase of them, and of the other sectaries\nin the meantime.” The temper and ill judgment of the Stuarts made\nshipwreck of all policy of this kind.  Yet speaking even of the time\nof the Stuarts, but their early time, Clarendon says that if Bishop\nAndrewes had succeeded Bancroft at Canterbury, the disaffection of\nseparatists might have been stayed and healed.  This, however, was\nnot to be; and Presbyterianism, after exercising for some years the\nlaw of the strongest, itself in Charles the Second’s reign suffered\nunder this law, and was finally cast out from the Church of England.",
        "Now the points of church discipline at issue between Presbyterianism\nand Episcopalianism are, as has been said, not essential.  They might\nprobably once have been settled in a sense altogether favourable to\nEpiscopalianism.  Hooker may have been right in thinking that there\nwere in his time circumstances which made it essential that they\nshould be settled in this sense, though the points in themselves were\nnot essential.  But by the very fact of the settlement not having\nthen been effected, of the [xlii] breach having gone on and widened,\nof the Nonconformists not having been amicably incorporated with the\nEstablishment but violently cast out from it, the circumstances are\nnow altogether altered.  Isaac Walton, a fervent Churchman, complains\nthat “the principles of the Nonconformists grew at last to such a\nheight and were vented so daringly, that, beside the loss of life and\nlimbs, the Church and State were both forced to use such other\nseverities as will not admit of an excuse, if it had not been to\nprevent confusion and the perilous consequences of it.” But those\nvery severities have of themselves made union on an Episcopalian\nfooting impossible.  Besides, Presbyterianism, the popular authority\nof elders, the power of the congregation in the management of their\nown affairs, has that warrant given to it by Scripture and by the\nproceedings of the early Christian Churches, it is so consonant with\nthe spirit of Protestantism which made the Reformation and which has\nsuch strength in this country, it is so predominant in the practice\nof other reformed churches, it was so strong in the original reformed\nChurch of England, that one cannot help doubting whether any\nsettlement which suppressed it could have been really permanent,\n[xliii] and whether it would not have kept appearing again and again,\nand causing dissension.",
        "Well, then, if culture is the disinterested endeavour after man’s\nperfection, will it not make us wish to cure the provincialism of the\nNonconformists, not by making Churchmen provincial along with them,\nbut by letting their popular church discipline, formerly found in the\nNational Church, and still found in the affections and practice of a\ngood part of the nation, appear in the National Church once more; and\nthus to bring Nonconformists into contact again, as their greater\nfathers were, with the main stream of national life?  Why should not\na Presbyterian or Congregational Church, based on this considerable\nand important, though not essential principle, of the congregation’s\npower in the church management, be established,–with equal rank for\nits chiefs with the chiefs of Episcopacy, and with admissibility of\nits ministers, under a revised system of patronage and preferment, to\nbenefices,–side by side with the Episcopal Church, as the Calvinist\nand Lutheran Churches are established side by side in France and\nGermany?  Such a Congregational Church would unite the main bodies of\nProtestants who are now separatists; and [xliv] separation would\ncease to be the law of their religious order.  Then,–through this\nconcession on a really considerable point of difference,–that\nendless splitting into hole-and-corner churches on quite\ninconsiderable points of difference, which must prevail so long as\nseparatism is the first law of a Nonconformist’s religious existence,\nwould be checked.  Culture would then find a place among English\nfollowers of the popular authority of elders, as it has long found it\namong the followers of Episcopal jurisdiction; and this we should\ngain by merely recognising, regularising, and restoring an element\nwhich appeared once in the reformed National Church, and which is\nconsiderable and national enough to have a sound claim to appear\nthere still.",
        "So far, then, is culture from making us unjust to the Nonconformists\nbecause it forbids us to worship their fetishes, that it even leads\nus to propose to do more for them than they themselves venture to\nclaim.  It leads us, also, to respect what is solid and respectable\nin their convictions, while their latitudinarian friends make light\nof it.  Not that the forms in which the human spirit tries to express\nthe inexpressible, or the forms by which man tries to [xlv] worship,\nhave or can have, as has been said, for the follower of perfection,\nanything necessary or eternal.  If the New Testament and the practice\nof the primitive Christians sanctioned the popular form of church\ngovernment a thousand times more expressly than they do, if the\nChurch since Constantine were a thousand times more of a departure\nfrom the scheme of primitive Christianity than it can be shown to be,\nthat does not at all make, as is supposed by men in bondage to the\nletter, the popular form of church government alone and always sacred\nand binding, or the work of Constantine a thing to be regretted.\nWhat is alone and always sacred and binding for man is the climbing\ntowards his total perfection, and the machinery by which he does this\nvaries in value according as it helps him to do it.  The planters of\nChristianity had their roots in deep and rich grounds of human life\nand achievement, both Jewish and also Greek; and had thus a\ncomparatively firm and wide basis amidst all the vehement inspiration\nof their mighty movement and change.  By their strong inspiration\nthey carried men off the old basis of life and culture, whether\nJewish or Greek, and generations arose [xlvi] who had their roots in\nneither world, and were in contact therefore with no full and great\nstream of human life.  Christianity might have lost herself, if it\nhad not been for some such change as that of the fourth century, in a\nmultitude of hole-and-corner churches like the churches of English\nNonconformity after its founders departed; churches without great\nmen, and without furtherance for the higher life of humanity.  At a\ncritical moment came Constantine, and placed Christianity,–or let us\nrather say, placed the human spirit, whose totality was endangered,–\nin contact with the main current of human life.  And his work was\njustified by its fruits, in men like Augustine and Dante, and indeed\nin all the great men of Christianity, Catholics or Protestants, ever\nsince.  And one may go beyond this.  Monsieur Albert Reville, whose\nreligious writings are always interesting, says that the conception\nwhich cultivated and philosophical Jews now entertain of Christianity\nand its founder, is probably destined to become the conception which\nChristians themselves will entertain.  Socinians are fond of saying\nthe same thing about the Socinian conception of Christianity.  Even\nif this were true, it would still have been [xlvii] better for a man,\nthrough the last eighteen hundred years, to have been a Christian,\nand a member of one of the great Christian communions, than to have\nbeen a Jew or a Socinian; because the being in contact with the main\nstream of human life is of more moment for a man’s total spiritual\ngrowth, and for his bringing to perfection the gifts committed to\nhim, which is his business on earth, than any speculative opinion\nwhich he may hold or think he holds.  Luther,–whom we have called a\nPhilistine of genius, and who, because he was a Philistine, had a\ncoarseness and lack of spiritual delicacy which have harmed his\ndisciples, but who, because he was a genius, had splendid flashes of\nspiritual insight,–Luther says admirably in his Commentary on the\nBook of Daniel: “A God is simply that whereon the human heart rests\nwith trust, faith, hope and love.  If the resting is right, then the\nGod too is right; if the resting is wrong, then the God too is\nillusory.”  In other words, the worth of what a man thinks about God\nand the objects of religion depends on what the man is; and what the\nman is, depends upon his having more or less reached the measure of a\nperfect and total man.",
        "[xlviii] All this is true; and yet culture, as we have seen, has more\ntenderness for scruples of the Nonconformists than have their Broad\nChurch friends.  That is because culture, disinterestedly trying, in\nits aim at perfection, to see things as they really are, sees how\nworthy and divine a thing is the religious side in man, though it is\nnot the whole of man.  And when Mr. Greg, who differs from us about\nedification, (and certainly we do not seem likely to agree with him\nas to what edifies), finding himself moved by some extraneous\nconsiderations or other to take a Church’s part against its enemies,\ncalls taking a Church’s part returning to base uses, culture teaches\nus how out of place is this language, and that to use it shows an\ninadequate conception of human nature, and that no Church will thank\na man for taking its part in this fashion, but will leave him with\nindifference to the tender mercies of his Benthamite friends.  But\navoiding Benthamism, or an inadequate conception of the religious\nside in man, culture makes us also avoid Mialism, or an inadequate\nconception of man’s totality.  Therefore to the worth and grandeur of\nthe religious side in man, culture is rejoiced and willing to pay any\ntribute, [xlix] except the tribute of man’s totality.  True, the\norder and liturgy of the Church of England one may be well contented\nto live and to die with, and they are such as to inspire an\naffectionate and revering attachment.  True, the reproaches of\nNonconformists against this order for “retaining badges of\nAntichristian recognisance;” and for “corrupting the right form of\nChurch polity with manifold Popish rites and ceremonies;” true, their\nassertion of the essentialness of their own supposed Scriptural\norder, and their belief in its eternal fitness, are founded on\nillusion.  True, the whole attitude of horror and holy superiority\nassumed by Puritanism towards the Church of Rome, is wrong and false,\nand well merits Sir Henry Wotton’s rebuke:–\"Take heed of thinking\nthat the farther you go from the Church of Rome, the nearer you are\nto God.”  True, one of the best wishes one could form for Mr.\nSpurgeon or Father Jackson is, that they might be permitted to learn\non this side the grave (for if they do not, a considerable surprise\nis certainly reserved for them on the other) that Whitfield and\nWesley were not at all better than St. Francis, and that they\nthemselves are not at all better than Lacordaire.  Yet, [l] in spite\nof all this, so noble and divine a thing is religion, so respectable\nis that earnestness which desires a prayer-book with one strain of\ndoctrine, so attaching is the order and discipline by which we are\nused to have our religion conveyed, so many claims on our regard has\nthat popular form of church government for which Nonconformists\ncontend, so perfectly compatible is it with all progress towards\nperfection, that culture would make us shy even to propose to\nNonconformists the acceptance of the Anglican prayer-book and the\nepiscopal order; and would be forward to wish them a prayer-book of\ntheir own approving, and the church discipline to which they are\nattached and accustomed.  Only not at the price of Mialism; that is,\nof a doctrine which leaves the Nonconformists in holes and corners,\nout of contact with the main current of national life.  One can lay\none’s finger, indeed, on the line by which this doctrine has grown\nup, and see how the essential part of Nonconformity is a popular\nchurch-discipline analogous to that of the other reformed churches,\nand how its voluntaryism is an accident.  It contended for the\nestablishment of its own church-discipline as the only true [li] one;\nand beaten in this contention, and seeing its rival established, it\ncame down to the more plausible proposal “to place all good men alike\nin a condition of religious equality;” and this plan of proceeding,\noriginally taken as a mere second-best, became, by long sticking to\nit and preaching it up, first fair, then righteous, then the only\nrighteous, then at last necessary to salvation.  This is the plan for\nremedying the Nonconformists’ divorce from contact with the national\nlife by divorcing churchmen too from contact with it; that is, as we\nhave familiarly before put it, the tailless foxes are for cutting off\ntails all round.  But this the other foxes could not wisely grant,\nunless it were proved that tails are of no value.  And so, too,\nunless it is proved that contact with the main current of national\nlife is of no value (and we have shown that it is of the greatest\nvalue), we cannot safely, even to please the Nonconformists in a\nmatter where we would please them as much as possible, admit Mialism.",
        "But now, as we have shown the disinterestedness which culture\nenjoins, and its obedience not to likings or dislikings, but to the\naim of perfection, let us show its flexibility,–its independence of\nmachinery.  That [lii] other and greater prophet of intelligence, and\nreason, and the simple natural truth of things,–Mr. Bright,–means\nby these, as we have seen, a certain set of measures which suit the\nspecial ends of Liberal and Nonconformist partisans.  For instance,\nreason and justice towards Ireland mean the abolishment of the\niniquitous Protestant ascendency in such a particular way as to suit\nthe Nonconformists’ antipathy to establishments.  Reason and justice\npursued in a different way, by distributing among the three main\nChurches of Ireland,–the Roman Catholic, the Anglican, and the\nPresbyterian,–the church property of Ireland, would immediately\ncease, for Mr. Bright and the Nonconformists, to be reason and\njustice at all, and would become, as Mr. Spurgeon says, “a setting up\nof the Roman image.”  Thus we see that the sort of intelligence\nreached by culture is more disinterested than the sort of\nintelligence reached by belonging to the Liberal party in the great\ntowns, and taking a commendable interest in politics.  But still more\nstriking is the difference between the two views of intelligence,\nwhen we see that culture not only makes a quite disinterested choice\nof the machinery [liii] proper to carry us towards sweetness and\nlight, and to make reason and the will of God prevail, but by even\nthis machinery does not hold stiffly and blindly, and easily passes\non beyond it to that for the sake of which it chose it.",
        "For instance: culture leads us to think that the ends of human\nperfection might be best served by establishing,–that is, by\nbringing into contact with the main current of the national life,–in\nIreland the Roman Catholic and the Presbyterian Churches along with\nthe Anglican Church; and, in England, a Presbyterian or\nCongregational Church of like rank and status with our Episcopalian\none.  It leads us to think that we should really, in this way, be\nworking to make reason and the will of God prevail; because we should\nbe making Roman Catholics better citizens, and Nonconformists,–nay,\nand Churchmen along with them,– larger-minded and more complete\nmen.  But undoubtedly there are great difficulties in such a plan as\nthis; and the plan is not one which looks very likely to be adopted.\nIt is a plan more for a time of creative statesmen, like the time of\nElizabeth, than for a time of instrumental [liv] statesmen like the\npresent.  The Churchman must rise above his ordinary self in order to\nfavour it; and the Nonconformist has worshipped his fetish of\nseparatism so long that he is likely to wish still to remain, like\nEphraim, “a wild ass alone by himself.”  The centre of power being\nwhere it is, our instrumental statesmen have every temptation, as is\nshown more at large in the following essay, in the first place, to\n“relieve themselves,” as The Times says, “of troublesome and\nirritating responsibilities;” in the second place, when they must\nact, to go along, as they do, with the ordinary self of those on\nwhose favour they depend, to adopt as their own its desires, and to\nserve them with fidelity, and even, if possible, with impulsiveness.\nThis is the more easy for them, because there are not wanting,–and\nthere never will be wanting,–thinkers like Mr. Baxter, Mr. Charles\nBuxton, and the Dean of Canterbury, to swim with the stream, but to\nswim with it philosophically; to call the desires of the ordinary\nself of any great section of the community edicts of the national\nmind and laws of human progress, and to give them a general, a\nphilosophic, and an imposing expression.  A generous statesman may\n[lv] honestly, therefore, soon unlearn any disposition to put his\ntongue in his cheek in advocating these desires, and may advocate\nthem with fervour and impulsiveness.  Therefore a plan such as that\nwhich we have indicated does not seem a plan so likely to find favour\nas a plan for abolishing the Irish Church by the power of the\nNonconformists’ antipathy to establishments.",
        "But to tell us that our fond dreams are on that account shattered is\ninexact, and is the sort of language which ought to be addressed to\nthe promoters of intelligence through public meetings and a\ncommendable interest in politics, when they fail in their designs,\nand not to us.  For we are fond stickers to no machinery, not even\nour own; and we have no doubt that perfection can be reached without\nit,–with free churches as with established churches, and with\ninstrumental statesmen as with creative statesmen.  But it can never\nbe reached without seeing things as they really are; and it is to\nthis, therefore, and to no machinery in the world, that culture\nsticks fondly.  It insists that men should not mistake, as they are\nprone to mistake, their natural taste for the bathos for a relish for\nthe sublime; and if statesmen, either [lvi] with their tongue in\ntheir cheek or through a generous impulsiveness, tell them their\nnatural taste for the bathos is a relish for the sublime, there is\nthe more need for culture to tell them the contrary.  It is delusion\non this point which is fatal, and against delusion on this point\nculture works.  It is not fatal to our Liberal friends to labour for\nfree trade, extension of the suffrage, and abolition of church-rates,\ninstead of graver social ends; but it is fatal to them to be told by\ntheir flatterers, and to believe, with our pauperism increasing more\nrapidly than our population, that they have performed a great, an\nheroic work, by occupying themselves exclusively, for the last thirty\nyears, with these Liberal nostrums, and that the right and good\ncourse for them now is to go on occupying themselves with the like\nfor the future.  It is not fatal to Americans to have no religious\nestablishments and no effective centres of high culture; but it is\nfatal to them to be told by their flatterers, and to believe, that\nthey are the most intelligent people in the whole world, when of\nintelligence, in the true and fruitful sense of the word, they even\nsingularly, as we have seen, come short.  It is not [lvii] fatal to\nthe Nonconformists to remain with their separated churches; but it is\nfatal to them to be told by their flatterers, and to believe, that\ntheirs is the one pure and Christ-ordained way of worshipping God,\nthat provincialism and loss of totality have not come to them from\nfollowing it, or that provincialism and loss of totality are not\nevils.  It is not fatal to the English nation to abolish the Irish\nChurch by the power of the Nonconformists’ antipathy to\nestablishments; but it is fatal to it to be told by its flatterers,\nand to believe, that it is abolishing it through reason and justice,\nwhen it is really abolishing it through this power; or to expect the\nfruits of reason and justice from anything but the spirit of reason\nand justice themselves.",
        "Now culture, because of its keen sense of what is really fatal, is\nall the more disposed to be pliant and easy about what is not fatal.\nAnd because machinery is the bane of politics, and an inward working,\nand not machinery, is what we most want, we keep advising our ardent\nyoung Liberal friends to think less of machinery, to stand more aloof\nfrom the arena of politics at present, and rather to try and promote,\nwith us, an inward working.  They do not listen [lviii] to us, and\nthey rush into the arena of politics, where their merits, indeed,\nseem to be little appreciated as yet; and then they complain of the\nreformed constituencies, and call the new Parliament a Philistine\nParliament.  As if a nation, nourished and reared in Hebraising,\ncould give us, just yet, anything better than a Philistine\nParliament!–for would a Barbarian Parliament be even so good, or a\nPopulace Parliament?  For our part, we rejoice to see our dear old\nfriends, the Hebraising Philistines, gathered in force in the Valley\nof Jehoshaphat before their final conversion, which will certainly\ncome; but for this conversion we must not try to oust them from their\nplaces, and to contend for machinery with them, but we must work on\nthem inwardly and cure them of Hebraising.",
        "Yet the days of Israel are innumerable; and in its blame of\nHebraising too, and in its praise of Hellenising, culture must not\nfail to keep its flexibility, and to give to its judgments that\npassing and provisional character which we have seen it impose on its\npreferences and rejections of machinery.  Now, and for us, it is a\ntime to Hellenise, and to praise knowing; for we have Hebraised too\nmuch, [lix] and have over-valued doing.  But the habits and\ndiscipline received from Hebraism remain for our race an eternal\npossession; and, as humanity is constituted, one must never assign\nthem the second rank to-day, without being ready to restore them to\nthe first rank to-morrow.  To walk staunchly by the best light one\nhas, to be strict and sincere with oneself, not to be of the number\nof those who say and do not, to be in earnest,–this is the\ndiscipline by which alone man is enabled to rescue his life from\nthraldom to the passing moment and to his bodily senses, to ennoble\nit, and to make it eternal.  And this discipline has been nowhere so\neffectively taught as in the school of Hebraism.  Sophocles and Plato\nknew as well as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews that\n“without holiness no man shall see God,” and their notion of what\ngoes to make up holiness was larger than his.  But the intense and\nconvinced energy with which the Hebrew, both of the Old and of the\nNew Testament, threw himself upon his ideal, and which inspired the\nincomparable definition of the great Christian virtue, Faith,–the\nsubstance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,–this\nenergy of faith in its ideal has [lx] belonged to Hebraism alone.  As\nour idea of holiness enlarges, and our scope of perfection widens\nbeyond the narrow limits to which the over-rigour of Hebraising has\ntended to confine it, we shall come again to Hebraism for that devout\nenergy in embracing our ideal, which alone can give to man the\nhappiness of doing what he knows.  “If ye know these things, happy\nare ye if ye do them!\"–the last word for infirm humanity will always\nbe that.  For this word, reiterated with a power now sublime, now\naffecting, but always admirable, our race will, as long as the world\nlasts, return to Hebraism; and the Bible, which preaches this word,\nwill forever remain, as Goethe called it, not only a national book,\nbut the Book of the Nations.  Again and again, after what seemed\nbreaches and separations, the prophetic promise to Jerusalem will\nstill be true:–Lo, thy sons come, whom thou sentest away; they come\ngathered from the west unto the east by the word of the Holy One,\nrejoicing in the remembrance of God.",
