        "“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle,\nas they drove from the town; “and really, upon serious\nconsideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\nyour eldest sister does on the matter.  It appears to me so very\nunlikely that any young man should form such a design against\na girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who\nwas actually staying in his colonel’s family, that I am strongly\ninclined to hope the best.  Could he expect that her friends\nwould not step forward?  Could he expect to be noticed again\nby the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?  His\ntemptation is not adequate to the risk!”",
        "“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a\nmoment.",
        "“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your\nuncle’s opinion.  It is really too great a violation of decency,\nhonour, and interest, for him to be guilty of.  I cannot think\nso very ill of Wickham.  Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give\nhim up, as to believe him capable of it?”",
        "“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\nneglect I can believe him capable.  If, indeed, it should be so!\nBut I dare not hope it.  Why should they not go on to Scotland\nif that had been the case?”",
        "“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute\nproof that they are not gone to Scotland.”",
        "“Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is\nsuch a presumption!  And, besides, no traces of them were to be\nfound on the Barnet road.”",
        "“Well, then–supposing them to be in London.  They may be there,\nthough for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional\npurpose.  It is not likely that money should be very abundant on\neither side; and it might strike them that they could be more\neconomically, though less expeditiously, married in London\nthan in Scotland.”",
        "“But why all this secrecy?  Why any fear of detection?  Why must\ntheir marriage be private?  Oh, no, no–this is not likely.\nHis most particular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was\npersuaded of his never intending to marry her.  Wickham will\nnever marry a woman without some money.  He cannot afford\nit.  And what claims has Lydia–what attraction has she beyond\nyouth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her\nsake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying\nwell?  As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the\ncorps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am\nnot able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a\nstep might produce.  But as to your other objection, I am afraid\nit will hardly hold good.  Lydia has no brothers to step forward;\nand he might imagine, from my father’s behaviour, from his\nindolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give\nto what was going forward in his family, that he would do as\nlittle, and think as little about it, as any father could do,\nin such a matter.”",
        "“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love\nof him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than\nmarriage?”",
        "“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth,\nwith tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and\nvirtue in such a point should admit of doubt.  But, really,\nI know not what to say.  Perhaps I am not doing her justice.\nBut she is very young; she has never been taught to think\non serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a\ntwelvemonth–she has been given up to nothing but amusement\nand vanity.  She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the\nmost idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that\ncame in her way.  Since the ––shire were first quartered in\nMeryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been\nin her head.  She has been doing everything in her power by\nthinking and talking on the subject, to give greater–what shall\nI call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally\nlively enough.  And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\nperson and address that can captivate a woman.”",
        "“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very\nill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”",
        "“Of whom does Jane ever think ill?  And who is there, whatever\nmight be their former conduct, that she would think capable of\nsuch an attempt, till it were proved against them?  But Jane\nknows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.  We both know\nthat he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he\nhas neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and\ndeceitful as he is insinuating.”",
        "“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose\ncuriosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.",
        "“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring.  “I told you, the\nother day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you\nyourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he\nspoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and\nliberality towards him.  And there are other circumstances which\nI am not at liberty–which it is not worth while to relate; but\nhis lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.  From what\nhe said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\nreserved, disagreeable girl.  Yet he knew to the contrary himself.\nHe must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we\nhave found her.”",
        "“But does Lydia know nothing of this?  can she be ignorant of\nwhat you and Jane seem so well to understand?”",
        "“Oh, yes!–that, that is the worst of all.  Till I was in Kent,\nand saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\nFitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.  And when I\nreturned home, the ––shire was to leave Meryton in a week or\nfortnight’s time.  As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom\nI related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our\nknowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any\none, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of\nhim should then be overthrown?  And even when it was settled\nthat Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\nher eyes to his character never occurred to me.  That she could\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head.\nThat such a consequence as this could ensue, you may easily\nbelieve, was far enough from my thoughts.”",
        "“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no\nreason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”",
        "“Not the slightest.  I can remember no symptom of affection on\neither side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you\nmust be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be\nthrown away.  When first he entered the corps, she was ready\nenough to admire him; but so we all were.  Every girl in or\nnear Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first\ntwo months; but he never distinguished her by any particular\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of\nextravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave\nway, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more\ndistinction, again became her favourites.”",
        "                          * * * * *",
        "It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be\nadded to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting\nsubject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them\nfrom it long, during the whole of the journey.  From Elizabeth’s\nthoughts it was never absent.  Fixed there by the keenest of all\nanguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or\nforgetfulness.",
        "They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one\nnight on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next\nday.  It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could\nnot have been wearied by long expectations.",
        "The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\nstanding on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;\nand, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise\nthat lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole\nbodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing\nearnest of their welcome.",
        "Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty\nkiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running\ndown from her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.",
        "Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled\nthe eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything\nhad been heard of the fugitives.",
        "“Not yet,” replied Jane.  “But now that my dear uncle is come,\nI hope everything will be well.”",
        "“Is my father in town?”",
        "“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”",
        "“And have you heard from him often?”",
        "“We have heard only twice.  He wrote me a few lines on\nWednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me\nhis directions, which I particularly begged him to do.  He merely\nadded that he should not write again till he had something of\nimportance to mention.”",
        "“And my mother–how is she?  How are you all?”",
        "“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\ngreatly shaken.  She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction\nin seeing you all.  She does not yet leave her dressing-room.\nMary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.”",
        "“But you–how are you?” cried Elizabeth.  “You look pale.\nHow much you must have gone through!”",
        "Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well;\nand their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and\nMrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an\nend to by the approach of the whole party.  Jane ran to her uncle\nand aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate\nsmiles and tears.",
        "When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which\nElizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the\nothers, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence\nto give.  The sanguine hope of good, however, which the\nbenevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her;\nshe still expected that it would all end well, and that every\nmorning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her\nfather, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce\ntheir marriage.",
        "Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few\nminutes’ conversation together, received them exactly as might\nbe expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives\nagainst the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of\nher own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the\nperson to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her\ndaughter must principally be owing.",
        "“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to\nBrighton, with all my family, this would not have happened;\nbut poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.  Why did\nthe Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?  I am sure there\nwas some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the\nkind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after.\nI always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her;\nbut I was overruled, as I always am.  Poor dear child!  And\nnow here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\nWickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and\nwhat is to become of us all?  The Collinses will turn us out\nbefore he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,\nbrother, I do not know what we shall do.”",
        "They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,\nafter general assurances of his affection for her and all her\nfamily, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,\nand would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering\nLydia.",
        "“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is\nright to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look\non it as certain.  It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.\nIn a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we\nknow that they are not married, and have no design of marrying,\ndo not let us give the matter over as lost.  As soon as I get to\ntown I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with\nme to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as\nto what is to be done.”",
        "“Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly\nwhat I could most wish for.  And now do, when you get to\ntown, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are\nnot married already, make them marry.  And as for wedding\nclothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she\nshall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they\nare married.  And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\nTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out\nof my wits–and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all\nover me–such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and\nsuch beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by\nday.  And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about\nher clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which\nare the best warehouses.  Oh, brother, how kind you are!  I\nknow you will contrive it all.”",
        "But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest\nendeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation\nto her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with\nher in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left\nher to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended\nin the absence of her daughters.",
        "Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no\nreal occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not\nattempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence\nenough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they\nwaited at table, and judged it better that one only of the\nhousehold, and the one whom they could most trust should\ncomprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.",
        "In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty,\nwho had been  too busily engaged in their separate apartments\nto make their appearance before.  One came from her books,\nand the other from her toilette.  The faces of both, however,\nwere tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except\nthat the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had\nherself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness\nthan usual to the accents of Kitty.  As for Mary, she was\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a\ncountenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated\nat table:",
        "“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much\ntalked of.  But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into\nthe wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”",
        "Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she\nadded, “Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw\nfrom it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is\nirretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;\nthat her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and\nthat she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the\nundeserving of the other sex.”",
        "Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much\noppressed to make any reply.  Mary, however, continued to\nconsole herself with such kind of moral extractions from the\nevil before them.",
        "In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be\nfor half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed\nherself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane\nwas equally eager to satisfy.  After joining in general\nlamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which\nElizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could\nnot assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the\nsubject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it\nwhich I have not already heard.  Give me further particulars.\nWhat did Colonel Forster say?  Had they no apprehension of\nanything before the elopement took place?  They must have seen\nthem together for ever.”",
        "“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\npartiality, especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any\nalarm.  I am so grieved for him!  His behaviour was attentive and\nkind to the utmost.  He was coming to us, in order to assure us\nof his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to\nScotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened\nhis journey.”",
        "“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?  Did\nhe know of their intending to go off?  Had Colonel Forster\nseen Denny himself?”",
        "“Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing\nanything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion\nabout it.  He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\nmarrying–and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might\nhave been misunderstood before.”",
        "“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\nentertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”",
        "“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?\nI felt a little uneasy–a little fearful of my sister’s happiness\nwith him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been\nalways quite right.  My father and mother knew nothing of that;\nthey only felt how imprudent a match it must be.  Kitty then\nowned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the\nrest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter she had prepared her for\nsuch a step.  She had known, it seems, of their being in love with\neach other, many weeks.”",
        "“But not before they went to Brighton?”",
        "“No, I believe not.”",
        "“And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham\nhimself?  Does he know his real character?”",
        "“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he\nformerly did.  He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\nAnd since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he\nleft Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.”",
        "“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew\nof him, this could not have happened!”",
        "“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.  “But to\nexpose the former faults of any person without knowing what\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.  We acted with\nthe best intentions.”",
        "“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to\nhis wife?”",
        "“He brought it with him for us to see.”",
        "Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\nThese were the contents:",
        "“My Dear Harriet,",
        "“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot\nhelp laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as\nsoon as I am missed.  I am going to Gretna Green, and if you\ncannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there\nis but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.  I should\nnever be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.  You\nneed not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do\nnot like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I\nwrite to them and sign my name ’Lydia Wickham.’  What a good\njoke it will be!  I can hardly write for laughing.  Pray make\nmy excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing\nwith him to-night.  Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he\nknows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball\nwe meet, with great pleasure.  I shall send for my clothes when\nI get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a\ngreat slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.\nGood-bye.  Give my love to Colonel Forster.  I hope you will\ndrink to our good journey.",
        "“Your affectionate friend,",
        "“Lydia Bennet.”",
        "“Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she\nhad finished it.  “What a letter is this, to be written at such\na moment!  But at least it shows that she was serious on the\nsubject of their journey.  Whatever he might afterwards\npersuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy.\nMy poor father! how he must have felt it!”",
        "“I never saw anyone so shocked.  He could not speak a word\nfor full ten minutes.  My mother was taken ill immediately,\nand the whole house in such confusion!”",
        "“Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it\nwho did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”",
        "“I do not know.  I hope there was.  But to be guarded at such a\ntime is very difficult.  My mother was in hysterics, and though\nI endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am\nafraid I did not do so much as I might have done!  But the\nhorror of what might possibly happen almost took from me\nmy faculties.”",
        "“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.  You do\nnot look well.  Oh that I had been with you!  you have had\nevery care and anxiety upon yourself alone.”",
        "“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in\nevery fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either\nof them.  Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,\nthat her hours of repose should not be broken in on.  My aunt\nPhillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went\naway; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.  She\nwas of great use and comfort to us all.  And Lady Lucas has\nbeen very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her\ndaughters’, if they should be of use to us.”",
        "“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps\nshe meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one\ncannot see too little of one’s neighbours.  Assistance is\nimpossible; condolence insufferable.  Let them triumph over us\nat a distance, and be satisfied.”",
        "She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her\nfather had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery\nof his daughter.",
        "“He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place\nwhere they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if\nanything could be made out from them.  His principal object\nmust be to discover the number of the hackney coach which\ntook them from Clapham.  It had come with a fare from London;\nand as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady’s\nremoving from one carriage into another might be remarked he\nmeant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover\nat what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\ndetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be\nimpossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.  I do\nnot know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in\nsuch a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed,\nthat I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.”",
