        "Why, tell me what profit a wrestler gains from him who\nexercises him beforehand? The very greatest: he trains me in the\npractice of endurance, of controlling my temper, of gentle ways.\nYou deny it. What, the man who lays hold of my neck, and\ndisciplines loins and shoulders, does me good, . . . while he\nthat trains me to keep my temper does me none? This is what it\nmeans, not knowing how to gain advantage from men! Is my\nneighbour bad? Bad to himself, but good to me: he brings my good\ntemper, my gentleness into play. Is my father bad? Bad to\nhimself, but good to me. This is the rod of Hermes; touch what\nyou will with it, they say, and it becomes gold. Nay, but bring\nwhat you will and I will transmute it into Good. Bring sickness,\nbring death, bring poverty and reproach, bring trial for life—\nall these things through the rod of Hermes shall be turned to\nprofit.",
