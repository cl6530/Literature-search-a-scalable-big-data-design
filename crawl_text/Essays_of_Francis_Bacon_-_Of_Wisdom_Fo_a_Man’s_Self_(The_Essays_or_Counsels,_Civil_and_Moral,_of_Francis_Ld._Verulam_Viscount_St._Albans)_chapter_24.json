        "AN ANT is a wise creature for itself, but it is a\n shrewd thing, in an orchard or garden.  And\ncertainly, men that are great lovers of themselves,\nwaste the public.  Divide with reason; between selflove and society; and be so true to thyself, as thou\nbe not false to others; specially to thy king and\ncountry.  It is a poor centre of a man’s actions, himself.  It is right earth.  For that only stands fast upon\nhis own centre; whereas all things, that have affinity with the heavens, move upon the centre of\nanother, which they benefit.  The referring of all\nto a man’s self, is more tolerable in a sovereign\nprince; because themselves are not only themselves, but their good and evil is at the peril of the\npublic fortune.  But it is a desperate evil, in a servant to a prince, or a citizen in a republic.  For\nwhatsoever affairs pass such a man’s hands, he\ncrooketh them to his own ends; which must needs\nbe often eccentric to the ends of his master, or state.\nTherefore, let princes, or states, choose such servants, as have not this mark; except they mean\ntheir service should be made but the accessory.\nThat which maketh the effect more pernicious, is\nthat all proportion is lost.  It were disproportion\nenough, for the servant’s good to be preferred before the master’s; but yet it is a greater extreme,\nwhen a little good of the servant, shall carry things\nagainst a great good of the master’s.  And yet that\nis the case of bad officers, treasurers, ambassadors,\ngenerals, and other false and corrupt servants;\nwhich set a bias upon their bowl, of their own\npetty ends and envies, to the overthrow of their\nmaster’s great and important affairs.  And for the\nmost part, the good such servants receive, is after\nthe model of their own fortune; but the hurt they\nsell for that good, is after the model of their\nmaster’s fortune.  And certainly it is the nature of\nextreme self-lovers, as they will set an house on fire,\nand it were but to roast their eggs; and yet these\nmen many times hold credit with their masters,\nbecause their study is but to please them, and profit\nthemselves; and for either respect, they will abandon the good of their affairs.",
        "Wisdom for a man’s self is, in many branches\nthereof, a depraved thing.  It is the wisdom of rats,\nthat will be sure to leave a house, somewhat before\nit fall.  It is the wisdom of the fox, that thrusts out\nthe badger, who digged and made room for him.\nIt is the wisdom of crocodiles, that shed tears when\nthey would devour.  But that which is specially to\nbe noted is, that those which (as Cicero says of\nPompey) are sui amantes, sine rivali, are many\ntimes unfortunate.  And whereas they have, all\ntheir times, sacrificed to themselves, they become\nin the end, themselves sacrifices to the inconstancy\nof fortune, whose wings they thought, by their\nself-wisdom, to have pinioned.",
