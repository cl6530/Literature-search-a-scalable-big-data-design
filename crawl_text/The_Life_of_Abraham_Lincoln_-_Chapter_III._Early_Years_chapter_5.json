        "\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865)\n16th President of the United States",
        "\n\n",
        "The year 1809 was fruitful in the birth of great men in the Anglo-Saxon\nrace. In that year were born Charles Darwin, scientist, Alfred\nTennyson, poet, William E. Gladstone, statesman, and, not least,\nAbraham Lincoln, liberator.",
        "Thomas Lincoln was left fatherless in early boyhood, and grew up\nwithout any schooling or any definite work. For the most part he did\nodd jobs as they were offered. He called himself a carpenter. But in a\nday when the outfit of tools numbered only about a half dozen, and when\nevery man was mainly his own carpenter, this trade could not amount to\nmuch. Employment was unsteady and pay was small.",
        "Thomas Lincoln, after his marriage to Nancy Hanks, lived in\nElizabethtown, Ky., where the first child, Sarah, was born. Shortly\nafter this event he decided to combine farming with his trade of\ncarpentering, and so removed to a farm fourteen miles out, situated in\nwhat is now La Rue County, where his wife, on the twelfth day of\nFebruary, 1809, gave birth to the son who was named Abraham after his\ngrandfather. The child was born in a log cabin of a kind very common in\nthat day and for many years later. It was built four-square and\ncomprised only one room, one window, and a door.",
        "Here they lived for a little more than four years, when the father\nremoved to another farm about fifteen miles further to the northeast.",
        "The occasion of this removal and of the subsequent one, two or three\nyears later, was undoubtedly the uncertainty of land titles in Kentucky\nin that day. This “roving disposition” cannot fairly be charged to\nshiftlessness. In spite of the extraordinary disadvantages of Thomas\nLincoln’s early life, he lived as well as his neighbors, though that\nwas humble enough, and accumulated a small amount of property in spite\nof the low rate of compensation.",
        "In the year 1816 Thomas determined to migrate to Indiana. He sold out\nhis farm, receiving for it the equivalent of $300. Of this sum, $20 was\nin cash and the rest was in whisky–ten barrels–which passed as a kind\nof currency in that day. He then loaded the bulk of his goods upon a\nflat boat, floating down the stream called Rolling Fork into Salt\nCreek, thence into the Ohio River, in fact, to the bottom of that\nriver. The watercourse was obstructed with stumps and snags of divers\nsorts, and especially with “sawyers,” or trees in the river which,\nforced by the current, make an up-and-down motion like that of a man\nsawing wood.",
        "The flat boat became entangled in these obstructions and was upset, and\nthe cargo went to the bottom. By dint of great labor much of this was\nrescued and the travelers pushed on as far as Thompson’s Ferry in Perry\nCounty, Indiana. There the cargo was left in the charge of friends, and\nLincoln returned for his family and the rest of his goods.",
        "During his father’s absence, the boy Abe had his first observation of\nsorrow. A brother had been born in the cabin and had died in infancy.\nThe little grave was in the wilderness, and before leaving that country\nforever, the mother, leading her six-year-old boy by the hand, paid a\nfarewell visit to the grave. The child beheld with awe the silent grief\nof the mother and carried in his memory that scene to his dying day.",
        "The father returned with glowing accounts of the new home. The family\nand the furniture,–to use so dignified a name for such meager\npossessions,–were loaded into a wagon or a cart, and they were soon on\nthe way to their new home.",
        "The traveling was slow, but the weather was fine, the journey\nprosperous, and they arrived duly at their destination. They pushed\nnorthward, or back from the river, about eighteen miles into the woods\nand settled in Spencer County near to a hamlet named Gentryville. Here\nthey established their home.",
        "The first thing, of course, was to stake off the land, enter the claim,\nand pay the government fee at the United States Land Office at\nVincennes. The amount of land was one quarter section, or one hundred\nand sixty acres.",
        "The next thing was to erect a cabin. In this case the cabin consisted\nof what was called a half-faced camp. That is, the structure was\nentirely open on one of its four sides. This was at the lower side of\nthe roof, and the opening was partly concealed by the hanging of the\nskins of deer and other wild animals. This open face fully supplied all\nneed of door and window.",
        "The structure was built four square, fourteen feet each way. Posts were\nset up at the corners, then the sides were made of poles placed as near\ntogether as possible. The interstices were filled in with chips and\nclay, which was called “chinking.” The fireplace and chimney were built\nat the back and outside. The chief advantage of this style of domicile\nis that it provides plenty of fresh air. With one side of the room\nentirely open, and with a huge fireplace at the other side, the\nsanitary problem of ventilation was solved.",
        "There were no Brussels carpets, no Persian rugs, no hardwood floors.\nThe bare soil was pounded hard, and that was the floor. There were two\nbeds inn the two rear corners of the rooms. The corner position saved\nboth space and labor. Two sides of the bed were composed of parts of\nthe two walls. At the opposite angle a stake, with a forked top, was\ndriven into the ground, and from this to the walls were laid two poles\nat right angles. This made the frame of the bed. Then “shakes,” or\nlarge hand-made shingles, were placed crosswise. Upon these were laid\nthe ticks filled with feathers or corn husks, and the couch was\ncomplete. Not stylish, but healthful and comfortable.",
        "The produce of his farm was chiefly corn, though a little wheat was\nraised for a change of diet. Doubtless there were enough of the staple\nvegetables which grow easily in that country. Butcher shops were not\nneeded, owing to the abundance of wild game.",
        "The principal portion of the life of the average boy concerns his\nschooling. As nearly as can be determined the aggregate of young\nLincoln’s schooling was about one year, and this was divided between\nfive teachers–an average of less than three months to each–and spread\nout over as many years. The branches taught were “readin’, writin’, and\ncipherin’ to the rule of three.” Any young man who happened along with\na fair knowledge of the three great R’s–\"Readin’, ’Ritin’, and’\nRithmetic\"–was thought fit to set up a school, taking his small pay in\ncash and boarding around–that is, spending one day or more at a time\nas the guest of each of his patrons.",
        "There was nothing of special interest in any of these teachers, but\ntheir names are preserved simply because the fact that they did teach\nhim is a matter of great interest. The first teacher was Zachariah\nRiney, a Roman Catholic, from whose schoolroom the Protestants were\nexcluded, or excused, during the opening exercises. Then came Caleb\nHazel. These were in Kentucky, and therefore their instruction of\nLincoln must have come to an end by the time he was seven years old.\nWhen ten years old he studied under one Dorsey, when about fourteen\nunder Crawford, and when sixteen under Swaney.",
        "It can hardly be doubted that his mother’s instruction was of more\nworth than all these put together. A woman who, under such limitations,\nhad energy enough to teach her husband to read and write, was a rare\ncharacter, and her influence could not be other than invaluable to the\nbright boy. Charles Lamb classified all literature in two divisions:\n“Books that are not books, and books that are books.” It is important\nthat every boy learn to read. But a far more important question is,\nWhat use does he make of his ability to read? Does he read “books that\nare books?” Let us now see what use Lincoln made of his knowledge of\nreading.",
        "In those days books were rare and his library was small and select. It\nconsisted at first of three volumes: The Bible, Aesop’s Fables and\nPilgrim’s Progress. Some-time in the eighties a prominent magazine\npublished a series of articles written by men of eminence in the\nvarious walks of life, under the title of “Books that have helped me.\"\nThe most noticeable fact was that each of these eminent men–men who\nhad read hundreds of books–specified not more than three or four\nbooks. Lincoln’s first list was of three. They were emphatically books.\nDay after day he read, pondered and inwardly digested them until they\nwere his own. Better books he could not have found in all the\nuniversities of Europe, and we begin to understand where he got his\nmoral vision, his precision of English style, and his shrewd humor.",
        "Later he borrowed from a neighbor, Josiah Crawford, a copy of Weems’\nLife of Washington. In lieu of a bookcase he tucked this, one night,\ninto the chinking of the cabin. A rain-storm came up and soaked the\nbook through and through. By morning it presented a sorry appearance.\nThe damage was done and could not be repaired. Crestfallen the lad\ncarried it back to the owner and, having no money, offered to pay for\nthe mischief in work. Crawford agreed and named seventy-five cents (in\nlabor) as a fair sum.",
        "“Does this pay for the book,” the borrower asked, “or only for the\ndamage to the book?” Crawford reckoned that the book “wa’n’t of much\naccount to him nor to any one else.” So Lincoln cheerfully did the\nwork–it was for three days–and owned the book.",
        "Later he had a life of Henry Clay, whom he nearly idolized. His one\npoet was Burns, whom he knew by heart “from a to izzard.” Throughout\nhis life he ranked Burns next to Shakespeare.",
        "The hymns which he most loved must have had influence not only on his\nreligious spirit, but also on his literary taste. Those which are\nmentioned are, “Am I a soldier of the cross?” “How tedious and\ntasteless the hours,” “There is a fountain filled with blood,” and\n“Alas, and did my Saviour bleed?” Good hymns every one of them, in that\nday, or in any day.",
        "Having no slate he did his “sums” in the sand on the ground, or on a\nwooden shovel which, after it was covered on both sides, he scraped\ndown so as to erase the work. A note-book is preserved, containing,\nalong with examples in arithmetic, this boyish doggerel:",
        "The penmanship bears a striking resemblance to that in later life.",
        "About a year after Thomas Lincoln’s family settled in Indiana, they\nwere followed by some neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Sparrow and Dennis Hanks,\na child. To these the Lincolns surrendered their camp and built for\nthemselves a cabin, which was slightly more pretentious than the first.\nIt had an attic, and for a stairway there were pegs in the wall up\nwhich an active boy could readily climb. There was a stationary table,\nthe legs being driven into the ground, some three-legged stools, and a\nDutch oven.",
        "In the year 1818 a mysterious epidemic passed over the region, working\nhavoc with men and cattle. It was called the “milk-sick.” Just what it\nwas physicians are unable to determine, but it was very destructive.\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Sparrow were attacked. They were removed, for better\ncare, to the home of the Lincolns, where they shortly died. By this\ntime Mrs. Lincoln was down with the same scourge. There was no doctor\nto be had, the nearest one being thirty-five miles away. Probably it\nmade no difference. At all events she soon died and the future\npresident passed into his first sorrow.",
        "The widowed husband was undertaker. With his own hands he “rived” the\nplanks, made the coffin, and buried Nancy Hanks, that remarkable woman.\nThere was no pastor, no funeral service. The grave was marked by a\nwooden slab, which, long years after, in 1879, was replaced by a stone\nsuitably inscribed.",
        "A traveling preacher known as Parson Elkin had occasionally preached in\nthe neighborhood of the Lincolns in Kentucky. The young boy now put to\nuse his knowledge of writing. He wrote a letter to the parson inviting\nhim to come over and preach the funeral sermon. How he contrived to get\nthe letter to its destination we do not know, but it was done. The\nkind-hearted preacher cheerfully consented, though it involved a long\nand hard journey. He came at his earliest convenience, which was some\ntime the next year.",
        "There was no church in which to hold the service. Lincoln never saw a\nchurch building of any description until he was grown. But the\nneighbors to the number of about two hundred assembled under the trees,\nwhere the parson delivered the memorial sermon.",
        "Lincoln was nine years old when his mother died, October 5th, 1818. Her\nlot was hard, her horizon was narrow, her opportunities were\nrestricted, her life was one of toil and poverty. All through her life\nand after her untimely death, many people would have said that she had\nhad at best but a poor chance in the world. Surely no one would have\npredicted that her name would come to be known and reverenced from\nocean to ocean. But she was faithful, brave, cheerful. She did her duty\nlovingly. In later years the nation joined with her son in paying honor\nto the memory of this noble, overworked, uncomplaining woman.",
