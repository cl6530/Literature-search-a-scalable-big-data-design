        "This story occurs under the blue skies and bluer laws of Puritan\nNew England, in the days when religion was still taken seriously\nby a great many people, and in the town of Plymouth where the\n“Mayflower”, having ploughed its platitudinous way from Holland,\nhad landed its precious cargo of pious Right Thinkers, moral\nGentlemen of God, and—Priscilla.",
        "Priscilla was—well, Priscilla had yellow hair.  In a later\ngeneration, in a 1921 June, if she had toddled by at a country\nclub dance you would have noticed first of all that glorious mass\nof bobbed corn-colored locks. You would, then, perhaps, have\nglanced idly at her face, and suddenly said “Oh my gosh!”  The\nnext moment you would have clutched the nearest stag and hissed,\n“Quick—yellow hair—silver dress—oh Judas!”  You would then\nhave been introduced, and after dancing nine feet you would have\nbeen cut in on by another panting stag.  In those nine delirious\nfeet you would have become completely dazed by one of the\nsmoothest lines since the building of the Southern Pacific.  You\nwould then have borrowed somebody’s flask, gone into the locker\nroom and gotten an edge—not a bachelor-dinner edge but just\nenough to give you the proper amount of confidence. You would\nhave returned to the ballroom, cut in on this twentieth century\nPriscilla, and taken her and your edge out to a convenient\nlimousine, or the first tee.",
        "It was of some such yellow-haired Priscilla that Homer dreamed\nwhen he smote his lyre and chanted, “I sing of arms and the man\";\nit was at the sight of such as she that rare Ben Johnson’s Dr.\nFaustus cried, “Was this the face that launched a thousand\nships?” In all ages has such beauty enchanted the minds of men,\ncalling forth in one century the Fiesolian terza rima of\n“Paradise Lost”, in another the passionate arias of a dozen\nBeethoven symphonies. In 1620 the pagan daughter of Helen of Troy\nand Cleopatra of the Nile happened, by a characteristic jest of\nthe great Ironist, to embark with her aunt on the\n“Mayflower”.",
        "Like all girls of eighteen Priscilla had learned to kiss and be\nkissed on every possible occasion; in the exotic and not at all\nuncommon pleasure of “petting” she had acquired infinite wisdom\nand complete disillusionment. But in all her “petting parties” on\nthe “Mayflower” and in Plymouth she had found no Puritan who held\nher interest beyond the first kiss, and she had lately reverted\nin sheer boredom to her boarding school habit of drinking gin in\nlarge quantities, a habit which was not entirely approved of by\nher old-fashioned aunt, although Mrs. Brewster was glad to have\nher niece stay at home in the evenings “instead”, as she told\nMrs. Bradford, “of running around with those boys, and really, my\ndear, Priscilla says some of the FUNNIEST things when she gets a\nlittle er—’boiled’, as she calls it—you must come over some\nevening, and bring the governor.”",
        "Mrs. Brewster, Priscilla’s aunt, is the ancestor of all New\nEngland aunts. She may be seen today walking down Tremont Street,\nBoston, in her Educator shoes on her way to S. S. Pierce’s which\nshe pronounces to rhyme with HEARSE.  The twentieth century Mrs.\nBrewster wears a highnecked black silk waist with a chatelaine\nwatch pinned over her left breast and a spot of Gordon’s codfish\n(no bones) over her right. When a little girl she was taken to\nsee Longfellow, Lowell, and Ralph Waldo Emerson; she speaks\nfamiliarly of the James boys, but this has no reference to the\nwell-known Missouri outlaws. She was brought up on blueberry\ncake, Postum and “The Atlantic Monthly\"; she loves the Boston\n“Transcript”, God, and her relatives in Newton Centre.  Her idea\nof a daring joke is the remark Susan Hale made to Edward Everett\nHale about sending underwear to the heathen. She once asked\nDonald Ogden Stewart to dinner with her niece; she didn’t think\nhis story about the lady mind reader who read the man’s mind and\nthen slapped his face, was very funny; she never asked him again.",
        "The action of this story all takes place in MRS.  BREWSTER’S\nPlymouth home on two successive June evenings.  As the figurative\ncurtain rises MRS.  BREWSTER is sitting at a desk reading the\nlatest instalment of Foxe’s “Book of Martyrs”.",
        "The sound of a clanking sword is heard outside.  MRS.  BREWSTER\nlooks up, smiles to herself, and goes on reading.  A knock—a\ntimid knock.",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  Come in.",
        "(Enter CAPTAIN MIKES STANDISH, whiskered and forty. In a later\ngeneration, with that imposing mustache and his hatred of\nIndians, Miles would undoubtedly have been a bank president. At\npresent he seems somewhat ill at ease, and obviously relieved to\nfind only PRISCILLA’S aunt at home.)",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  Good evening, Captain Standish.",
        "MILES:  Good evening, Mrs. Brewster.  It’s—it’s cool for June,\nisn’t it?",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  Yes.  I suppose we’ll pay, for it with a hot\nJuly, though.",
        "MILES (nervously): Yes, but it—it is cool for June, isn’t it?",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  So you said, Captain.",
        "MILES:  Yes.  So I said, didn’t I?  (Silence.)",
        "MILES:  Mistress Priscilla isn’t home, then?",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  Why, I don’t think so, Captain But I never can\nbe sure where Priscilla is.",
        "MILES (eagerly): She’s a—a fine girl, isn’t she? A fine girl.",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  Why, yes.  Of course, Priscilla has her faults\nbut she’d make some man a fine wife—some man who knew how to\nhandle her— an older man, with experience.",
        "MILES:  Do you really think so, Mrs. Brewster?  (After a minute.)\nDo you think Priscilla is thinking about marrying anybody in\nparticular?",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  Well, I can’t say, Captain.  You know—she’s a\nlittle wild. Her mother was wild, too, you know—that is, before\nthe Lord spoke to her. They say she used to be seen at the\nMermaid Tavern in London with all those play-acting people.  She\nalways used to say that Priscilla would marry a military man.",
        "MILES:  A military man?  Well, now tell me Mrs. Brewster, do you\nthink that a sweet delicate creature like Priscilla—",
        "A VOICE (in the next room): Oh DAMN!",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  That must be Priscilla now.",
        "THE VOICE:  Auntie!",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  Yes, Priscilla dear.",
        "THE VOICE:  Where in hell did you put the vermouth?",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  In the cupboard, dear.  I do hope you aren’t\ngoing to get—er—\"boiled” again tonight, Priscilla.  (Enter\nPRISCILLA, infinitely radiant, infinitely beautiful, with a\nbottle of vermouth in one hand and a jug of gin in the other.)\nPRISCILLA:  Auntie, that was a dirty trick to hide the vermouth. \nHello Miles—shoot many Indians today?",
        "MILES:  Why—er er—no, Mistress Priscilla.",
        "PRISCILLA:  Wish you’d take me with you next time, Miles.  I’d\nlove to shoot an Indian, wouldn’t you, auntie?",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  Priscilla!  What an idea!  And please dear, give\nAuntie Brewster the gin.  I—er—promised to take some to the\nchurch social tonight and it’s almost all gone now.",
        "MILES:  I didn’t see you at church last night, Mistress\nPriscilla.",
        "PRISCILLA:  Well I’ll tell you, Miles.  I started to go to\nchurch— really felt awfully religious.  But just as I was\nleaving I thought, “Priscilla, how about a drink—just one little\ndrink?”  You know, Miles, church goes so much better when you’re\njust a little boiled— the lights and everything just kind\nof—oh, its glorious. Well last night, after I’d had a little\nliquor, the funniest thing happened.  I felt awfully good, not\nlike church at all— so I just thought I’d take a walk in the\nwoods.  And I came to a pool—a wonderful honest-to-God\npool—with the moon shining right into the middle of it.  So I\njust undressed and dove in and it was the most marvelous thing in\nthe world. And then I danced on the bank in the grass and the\nmoonlight— oh, Lordy, Miles, you ought to have seen me.",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  Priscilla!",
        "PRISCILLA:  ’Scuse me, Auntie Brewster.  And then I just lay in\nthe grass and sang and laughed.",
        "MRS.  BREWSTER:  Dear, you’ll catch your death of cold one of\nthese nights.  I hope you’ll excuse me, Captain Standish; it’s\ntime I was going to our social.  I’ll leave Priscilla to\nentertain you.  Now be a good girl, Priscilla, and please dear\ndon’t drink straight vermouth—remember what happened last time.\nGood night, Captain—good night, dear.",
        "(Exit MRS.  BREWSTER with gin.)",
        "PRISCILLA:  Oh damn!  What’ll we do, Miles—I’m getting awfully\nsleepy.",
        "MILES:  Why—we might—er—pet a bit.",
        "PRISCILLA (yawning): No. I’m too tired—besides, I hate whiskers.",
        "MILES:  Yes, that’s so, I remember.  (Ten minutes’ silence, with\nMILES looking sentimentally into the fireplace, PRISCILLA curled\nup in a chair on the other side.)",
        "MILES:  I was—your aunt and I—we were talking about you before\nyou came in. It was a talk that meant a lot to me.",
        "PRISCILLA:  Miles, would you mind closing that window?",
        "(MILES closes the window and returns to his chair by the\nfireplace.)",
        "MILES:  And your aunt told me that your mother said you would\nsome day marry a military man.",
        "PRISCILLA:  Miles, would you mind passing me that pillow over\nthere?",
        "(MILES gets up, takes the pillow to PRISCILLA and again sits\ndown.",
        "MILES:  And I thought that if you wanted a military man why—\nwell, I’ve always thought a great deal of you, Mistress\nPriscilla— and since my Rose died I’ve been pretty lonely, and\nwhile I’m nothing but a rough old soldier yet—well, what I’m\ndriving at is— you see, maybe you and I could sort of—well, I’m\nnot much of a hand at fancy love speeches and all that—but",
        "(He is interrupted by a snore.  He glances up and sees that\nPRISCILLA has fallen fast asleep.  He sits looking hopelessly\ninto the fireplace for a long time, then gets up, puts on his hat\nand tiptoes out of the door.) ",
        "THE NEXT EVENING",
        "PRISCILLA is sitting alone, lost in revery, before the fireplace.\nIt is almost as if she had not moved since the evening before.",
        "A knock, and the door opens to admit JOHN ALDEN, nonchalant,\ndisillusioned, and twenty-one.",
        "JOHN:  Good evening.  Hope I don’t bother you.",
        "PRISCILLA:  The only people who bother me are women who tell me\nI’m beautiful and men who don’t.",
        "JOHN:  Not a very brilliant epigram—but still—yes, you ARE\nbeautiful.",
        "PRISCILLA:  Of course, if it’s an effort for you to say—",
        "JOHN:  Nothing is worthwhile without effort.",
        "PRISCILLA:  Sounds like Miles Standish; many things I do without\neffort are worthwhile; I am beautiful without the slightest\neffort.",
        "JOHN:  Yes, you’re right.  I could kiss you without any effort—\nand that would be worthwhile—perhaps.",
        "PRISCILLA:  Kissing me would prove nothing.  I kiss as casually\nas I breathe.",
        "JOHN:  And if you didn’t breathe—or kiss—you would die.",
        "PRISCILLA:  Any woman would.",
        "JOHN:  Then you are like other women.  How\nunfortunate.",
        "PRISCILLA:  I am like no woman you ever knew.",
        "JOHN:  You arouse my curiosity.",
        "PRISCILLA:  Curiosity killed a cat.",
        "JOHN:  A cat may look at a—Queen.",
        "PRISCILLA:  And a Queen keeps cats for her amusement. They purr\nso delightfully when she pets them.",
        "JOHN:  I never learned to purr; it must be amusing—for the\nQueen.",
        "PRISCILLA:  Let me teach you.  I’m starting a new class tonight.",
        "JOHN:  I’m afraid I couldn’t afford to pay the tuition.",
        "PRISCILLA:  For a few exceptionally meritorious pupils, various\nscholarships and fellowships have been provided.",
        "JOHN:  By whom?  Old graduates?",
        "PRISCILLA:  NO—the institution has been endowed by God—",
        "JOHN:  With exceptional beauty—I’m afraid I’m going to kiss you. \nNOW.",
        "(They kiss.)",
        "(Ten minutes pass.)",
        "PRISCILLA:  Stop smiling in that inane way.",
        "JOHN:  I just happened to think of something awfully funny. You\nknow the reason why I came over here tonight?",
        "PRISCILLA:  To see me.  I wondered why you hadn’t come months\nago.",
        "JOHN:  No. It’s really awfully funny—but I came here tonight\nbecause Miles Standish made me promise this morning to ask you to\nmarry him. Miles is an awfully good egg, really\nPriscilla.",
        "PRISCILLA:  Speak for yourself, John.  (They kiss.)",
        "PRISCILLA:  Again.",
        "JOHN:  Again—and again.  Oh Lord, I’m gone.",
        "(An hour later JOHN leaves.  As the door closes behind him\nPRISCILLA sinks back into her chair before the fireplace; an hour\npasses, and she does not move; her aunt returns from the\nBradfords’ and after a few ineffectual attempts at conversation\ngoes to bed alone; the candles gutter, flicker, and die out; the\nroom is filled of sacred silence.  Once more the clock chimes\nforth the hour—the hour of fluted peace, of dead desire and epic\nlove.  Oh not for aye, Endymion, mayst thou unfold the purple\npanoply of priceless years. She sleeps—PRISCILLA sleeps—and\ndown the palimpsest of age-old passion the lyres of night breathe\nforth their poignant praise. She sleeps—eternal Helen—in the\nmoonlight of a thousand years; immortal symbol of immortal aeons,\nflower of the gods transplanted on a foreign shore, infinitely\nrare, infinitely erotic.[1]) ",
