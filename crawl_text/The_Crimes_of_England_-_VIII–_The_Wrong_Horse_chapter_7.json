        "In another chapter I mentioned some of the late Lord Salisbury’s remarks\nwith regret, but I trust with respect; for in certain matters he\ndeserved all the respect that can be given to him. His critics said that\nhe “thought aloud\"; which is perhaps the noblest thing that can be said\nof a man. He was jeered at for it by journalists and politicians who had\nnot the capacity to think or the courage to tell their thoughts. And he\nhad one yet finer quality which redeems a hundred lapses of anarchic\ncynicism. He could change his mind upon the platform: he could repent in\npublic. He could not only think aloud; he could “think better” aloud.\nAnd one of the turning-points of Europe had come in the hour when he\navowed his conversion from the un-Christian and un-European policy into\nwhich his dexterous Oriental master, Disraeli, had dragged him; and\ndeclared that England had “put her money on the wrong horse.” When he\nsaid it, he referred to the backing we gave to the Turk under a\nfallacious fear of Russia. But I cannot but think that if he had lived\nmuch longer, he would have come to feel the same disgust for his long\ndiplomatic support of the Turk’s great ally in the North. He did not\nlive, as we have lived, to feel that horse run away with us, and rush on\nthrough wilder and wilder places, until we knew that we were riding on\nthe nightmare.",
        "What was this thing to which we trusted? And how may we most quickly\nexplain its development from a dream to a nightmare, and the\nhair’s-breadth escape by which it did not hurl us to destruction, as it\nseems to be hurling the Turk? It is a certain spirit; and we must not\nask for too logical a definition of it, for the people whom it possesses\ndisown logic; and the whole thing is not so much a theory as a confusion\nof thought. Its widest and most elementary character is adumbrated in\nthe word Teutonism or Pan-Germanism; and with this (which was what\nappeared to win in 1870) we had better begin. The nature of\nPan-Germanism may be allegorised and abbreviated somewhat thus:",
        "The horse asserts that all other creatures are morally bound to\nsacrifice their interests to his, on the specific ground that he\npossesses all noble and necessary qualities, and is an end in himself.\nIt is pointed out in answer that when climbing a tree the horse is less\ngraceful than the cat; that lovers and poets seldom urge the horse to\nmake a noise all night like the nightingale; that when submerged for\nsome long time under water, he is less happy than the haddock; and that\nwhen he is cut open pearls are less often found in him than in an\noyster. He is not content to answer (though, being a muddle-headed\nhorse, he does use this answer also) that having an undivided hoof is\nmore than pearls or oceans or all ascension or song. He reflects for a\nfew years on the subject of cats; and at last discovers in the cat “the\ncharacteristic equine quality of caudality, or a tail\"; so that cats\nare horses, and wave on every tree-top the tail which is the equine\nbanner. Nightingales are found to have legs, which explains their power\nof song. Haddocks are vertebrates; and therefore are sea-horses. And\nthough the oyster outwardly presents dissimilarities which seem to\ndivide him from the horse, he is by the all-filling nature-might of the\nsame horse-moving energy sustained.",
        "Now this horse is intellectually the wrong horse. It is not perhaps\ngoing too far to say that this horse is a donkey. For it is obviously\nwithin even the intellectual resources of a haddock to answer, “But if a\nhaddock is a horse, why should I yield to you any more than you to me?\nWhy should that singing horse commonly called the nightingale, or that\nclimbing horse hitherto known as the cat, fall down and worship you\nbecause of your horsehood? If all our native faculties are the\naccomplishments of a horse–why then you are only another horse without\nany accomplishments.” When thus gently reasoned with, the horse flings\nup his heels, kicks the cat, crushes the oyster, eats the haddock and\npursues the nightingale, and that is how the war began.",
        "This apologue is not in the least more fantastic than the facts of the\nTeutonic claim. The Germans do really say that Englishmen are only\nSea-Germans, as our haddocks were only sea-horses. They do really say\nthat the nightingales of Tuscany or the pearls of Hellas must somehow be\nGerman birds or German jewels. They do maintain that the Italian\nRenaissance was really the German Renaissance, pure Germans having\nItalian names when they were painters, as cockneys sometimes have when\nthey are hair-dressers. They suggest that Jesus and the great Jews were\nTeutonic. One Teutonist I read actually explained the fresh energy of\nthe French Revolution and the stale privileges of its German enemies by\nsaying that the Germanic soul awoke in France and attacked the Latin\ninfluence in Germany. On the advantages of this method I need not dwell:\nif you are annoyed at Jack Johnson knocking out an English\nprize-fighter, you have only to say that it was the whiteness of the\nblack man that won and the blackness of the white man that was beaten.\nBut about the Italian Renaissance they are less general and will go into\ndetail. They will discover (in their researches into ’istry, as Mr.\nGandish said) that Michael Angelo’s surname was Buonarotti; and they\nwill point out that the word “roth” is very like the word “rot.” Which,\nin one sense, is true enough. Most Englishmen will be content to say it\nis all rot and pass on. It is all of a piece with the preposterous\nPrussian history, which talks, for instance, about the “perfect\nreligious tolerance of the Goths\"; which is like talking about the legal\nimpartiality of chicken-pox. He will decline to believe that the Jews\nwere Germans; though he may perhaps have met some Germans who were Jews.\nBut deeper than any such practical reply, lies the deep inconsistency of\nthe parable. It is simply this; that if Teutonism be used for\ncomprehension it cannot be used for conquest. If all intelligent peoples\nare Germans, then Prussians are only the least intelligent Germans. If\nthe men of Flanders are as German as the men of Frankfort, we can only\nsay that in saving Belgium we are helping the Germans who are in the\nright against the Germans who are in the wrong. Thus in Alsace the\nconquerors are forced into the comic posture of annexing the people for\nbeing German and then persecuting them for being French. The French\nTeutons who built Rheims must surrender it to the South German Teutons\nwho have partly built Cologne; and these in turn surrender Cologne to\nthe North German Teutons, who never built anything, except the wooden\nAunt Sally of old Hindenburg. Every Teuton must fall on his face before\nan inferior Teuton; until they all find, in the foul marshes towards the\nBaltic, the very lowest of all possible Teutons, and worship him–and\nfind he is a Slav. So much for Pan-Germanism.",
        "But though Teutonism is indefinable, or at least is by the Teutons\nundefined, it is not unreal. A vague but genuine soul does possess all\npeoples who boast of Teutonism; and has possessed ourselves, in so far\nas we have been touched by that folly. Not a race, but rather a\nreligion, the thing exists; and in 1870 its sun was at noon. We can most\nbriefly describe it under three heads.",
        "The victory of the German arms meant before Leipzic, and means now, the\noverthrow of a certain idea. That idea is the idea of the Citizen. This\nis true in a quite abstract and courteous sense; and is not meant as a\nloose charge of oppression. Its truth is quite compatible with a view\nthat the Germans are better governed than the French. In many ways the\nGermans are very well governed. But they might be governed ten thousand\ntimes better than they are, or than anybody ever can be, and still be\nas far as ever from governing. The idea of the Citizen is that his\nindividual human nature shall be constantly and creatively active in\naltering the State. The Germans are right in regarding the idea as\ndangerously revolutionary. Every Citizen is a revolution. That is, he\ndestroys, devours and adapts his environment to the extent of his own\nthought and conscience. This is what separates the human social effort\nfrom the non-human; the bee creates the honey-comb, but he does not\ncriticise it. The German ruler really does feed and train the German as\ncarefully as a gardener waters a flower. But if the flower suddenly\nbegan to water the gardener, he would be much surprised. So in Germany\nthe people really are educated; but in France the people educates. The\nFrench not only make up the State, but make the State; not only make it,\nbut remake it. In Germany the ruler is the artist, always painting the\nhappy German like a portrait; in France the Frenchman is the artist,\nalways painting and repainting France like a house. No state of social\ngood that does not mean the Citizen choosing good, as well as getting\nit, has the idea of the Citizen at all. To say the Germanies are\nnaturally at war with this idea is merely to respect them and take them\nseriously: otherwise their war on the French Revolution would be only an\nignorant feud. It is this, to them, risky and fanciful notion of the\ncritical and creative Citizen, which in 1870 lay prostrate under United\nGermany–under the undivided hoof.",
        "Nevertheless, when the German says he has or loves freedom, what he says\nis not false. He means something; and what he means is the second\nprinciple, which I may summarise as the Irresponsibility of Thought.\nWithin the iron framework of the fixed State, the German has not only\nliberty but anarchy. Anything can be said although, or rather because,\nnothing can be done. Philosophy is really free. But this practically\nmeans only that the prisoner’s cell has become the madman’s cell: that\nit is scrawled all over inside with stars and systems, so that it looks\nlike eternity. This is the contradiction remarked by Dr. Sarolea, in his\nbrilliant book, between the wildness of German theory and the tameness\nof German practice. The Germans sterilise thought, making it active\nwith a wild virginity; which can bear no fruit.",
        "But though there are so many mad theories, most of them have one root;\nand depend upon one assumption. It matters little whether we call it,\nwith the German Socialists, “the Materialist Theory of History\"; or,\nwith Bismarck, “blood and iron.” It can be put most fairly thus: that\nall important events of history are biological, like a change of\npasture or the communism of a pack of wolves. Professors are still\ntearing their hair in the effort to prove somehow that the Crusaders\nwere migrating for food like swallows; or that the French Revolutionists\nwere somehow only swarming like bees. This works in two ways often\naccounted opposite; and explains both the German Socialist and the\nJunker. For, first, it fits in with Teutonic Imperialism; making the\n“blonde beasts” of Germania into lions whose nature it is to eat such\nlambs as the French. The highest success of this notion in Europe is\nmarked by praise given to a race famous for its physical firmness and\nfighting breed, but which has frankly pillaged and scarcely pretended\nto rule; the Turk, whom some Tories called “the gentleman of Europe.\"\nThe Kaiser paused to adore the Crescent on his way to patronise the\nCross. It was corporately embodied when Greece attempted a solitary\nadventure against Turkey and was quickly crushed. That English guns\nhelped to impose the mainly Germanic policy of the Concert upon Crete,\ncannot be left out of mind while we are making appeals to Greece–or\nconsidering the crimes of England.",
        "But the same principle serves to keep the internal politics of the\nGermans quiet, and prevent Socialism being the practical hope or peril\nit has been in so many other countries. It operates in two ways; first,\nby a curious fallacy about “the time not being ripe\"–as if time could\never be ripe. The same savage superstition from the forests had infected\nMatthew Arnold pretty badly when he made a personality out of the\nZeitgeist–perhaps the only ghost that was ever entirely fabulous. It is\ntricked by a biological parallel, by which the chicken always comes out\nof the egg “at the right time.” He does not; he comes out when he comes\nout. The Marxian Socialist will not strike till the clock strikes; and\nthe clock is made in Germany, and never strikes. Moreover, the theory of\nall history as a search for food makes the masses content with having\nfood and physic, but not freedom. The best working model in the matter\nis the system of Compulsory Insurance; which was a total failure and\ndead letter in France but has been, in the German sense, a great success\nin Germany. It treats employed persons as a fixed, separate, and lower\ncaste, who must not themselves dispose of the margin of their small\nwages. In 1911 it was introduced into England by Mr. Lloyd George, who\nhad studied its operations in Germany, and, by the Prussian prestige in\n“social reform,” was passed.",
        "These three tendencies cohere, or are cohering, in an institution which\nis not without a great historical basis and not without great modern\nconveniences. And as France was the standard-bearer of citizenship in\n1798, Germany is the standard-bearer of this alternative solution in\n1915. The institution which our fathers called Slavery fits in with, or\nrather logically flows from, all the three spirits of which I have\nspoken, and promises great advantages to each of them. It can give the\nindividual worker everything except the power to alter the State–that\nis, his own status. Finality (or what certain eleutheromaniacs would\ncall hopelessness) of status is the soul of Slavery–and of Compulsory\nInsurance. Then again, Germany gives the individual exactly the liberty\nthat has always been given to a slave–the liberty to think, the liberty\nto dream, the liberty to rage; the liberty to indulge in any\nintellectual hypotheses about the unalterable world and state–such as\nhave always been free to slaves, from the stoical maxims of Epictetus to\nthe skylarking fairy tales of Uncle Remus. And it has been truly urged\nby all defenders of slavery that, if history has merely a material test,\nthe material condition of the subordinate under slavery tends to be good\nrather than bad. When I once pointed out how precisely the “model\nvillage” of a great employer reproduces the safety and seclusion of an\nold slave estate, the employer thought it quite enough to answer\nindignantly that he had provided baths, playing-grounds, a theatre,\netc., for his workers. He would probably have thought it odd to hear a\nplanter in South Carolina boast that he had provided banjos, hymn-books,\nand places suitable for the cake-walk. Yet the planter must have\nprovided the banjos, for a slave cannot own property. And if this\nGermanic sociology is indeed to prevail among us, I think some of the\nbroad-minded thinkers who concur in its prevalence owe something like an\napology to many gallant gentlemen whose graves lie where the last battle\nwas fought in the Wilderness; men who had the courage to fight for it,\nthe courage to die for it and, above all, the courage to call it by its\nname.",
        "With the acceptance by England of the German Insurance Act, I bring this\nsketch of the past relations of the two countries to an end. I have\nwritten this book because I wish, once and for all, to be done with my\nfriend Professor Whirlwind of Prussia, who has long despaired of really\ndefending his own country, and has fallen back upon abusing mine. He has\ndropped, amid general derision, his attempt to call a thing right when\neven the Chancellor who did it called it wrong. But he has an idea that\nif he can show that somebody from England somewhere did another wrong,\nthe two wrongs may make a right. Against the cry of the Roman Catholic\nPoles the Prussian has never done, or even pretended to do, anything but\nharden his heart; but he has (such are the lovable inconsistencies of\nhuman nature) a warm corner in his heart for the Roman Catholic Irish.\nHe has not a word to say for himself about the campaign in Belgium, but\nhe still has many wise, reproachful words to utter about the campaign in\nSouth Africa. I propose to take those words out of his mouth. I will\nhave nothing to do with the fatuous front-bench pretensions that our\ngovernors always govern well, that our statesmen are never whitewashed\nand never in need of whitewash. The only moral superiority I claim is\nthat of not defending the indefensible. I most earnestly urge my\ncountrymen not to hide behind thin official excuses, which the sister\nkingdoms and the subject races can easily see through. We can confess\nthat our crimes have been as mountains, and still not be afraid of the\npresent comparison. There may be, in the eyes of some, a risk in\ndwelling in this dark hour on our failures in the past: I believe\nprofoundly that the risk is all the other way. I believe that the most\ndeadly danger to our arms to-day lies in any whiff of that self-praise,\nany flavour of that moral cowardice, any glimpse of that impudent and\nultimate impenitence, that may make one Boer or Scot or Welshman or\nIrishman or Indian feel that he is only smoothing the path for a second\nPrussia. I have passed the great part of my life in criticising and\ncondemning the existing rulers and institutions of my country: I think\nit is infinitely the most patriotic thing that a man can do. I have no\nillusions either about our past or our present. I think our whole\nhistory in Ireland has been a vulgar and ignorant hatred of the\ncrucifix, expressed by a crucifixion. I think the South African War was\na dirty work which we did under the whips of moneylenders. I think\nMitchelstown was a disgrace; I think Denshawi was a devilry.",
        "Yet there is one part of life and history in which I would assert the\nabsolute spotlessness of England. In one department we wear a robe of\nwhite and a halo of innocence. Long and weary as may be the records of\nour wickedness, in one direction we have done nothing but good. Whoever\nwe may have wronged, we have never wronged Germany. Again and again we\nhave dragged her from under the just vengeance of her enemies, from the\nholy anger of Maria Teresa, from the impatient and contemptuous common\nsense of Napoleon. We have kept a ring fence around the Germans while\nthey sacked Denmark and dismembered France. And if we had served our God\nas we have served their kings, there would not be to-day one remnant\nof them in our path, either to slander or to slay us.",
