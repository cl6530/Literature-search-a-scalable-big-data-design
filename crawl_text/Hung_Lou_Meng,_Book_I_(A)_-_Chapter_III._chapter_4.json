        "  Lin Ju-hai appeals to his brother-in-law, Chia Cheng, recommending\n      Yü-ts’un, his daughter’s tutor, to his consideration.\n  Dowager lady Chia sends to fetch her granddaughter, out of\n      commiseration for her being a motherless child.",
        "But to proceed with our narrative.",
        "Yü-ts’un, on speedily turning round, perceived that the speaker was no\nother than a certain Chang Ju-kuei, an old colleague of his, who had\nbeen denounced and deprived of office, on account of some case or other;\na native of that district, who had, since his degradation, resided in\nhis family home.",
        "Having lately come to hear the news that a memorial, presented in the\ncapital, that the former officers (who had been cashiered) should be\nreinstated, had received the imperial consent, he had promptly done all\nhe could, in every nook and corner, to obtain influence, and to find the\nmeans (of righting his position,) when he, unexpectedly, came across\nYü-ts’un, to whom he therefore lost no time in offering his\ncongratulations. The two friends exchanged the conventional salutations,\nand Chang Ju-kuei forthwith communicated the tidings to Yü-ts’un.",
        "Yü-ts’un was delighted, but after he had made a few remarks, in a great\nhurry, each took his leave and sped on his own way homewards.",
        "Leng Tzu-hsing, upon hearing this conversation, hastened at once to\npropose a plan, advising Yü-ts’un to request Lin Ju-hai, in his turn, to\nappeal in the capital to Mr. Chia Cheng for support.",
        "Yü-ts’un accepted the suggestion, and parted from his companion.",
        "On his return to his quarters, he made all haste to lay his hand on the\nMetropolitan Gazette, and having ascertained that the news was\nauthentic, he had on the next day a personal consultation with Ju-hai.",
        "“Providence and good fortune are both alike propitious!” exclaimed\nJu-hai. “After the death of my wife, my mother-in-law, whose residence\nis in the capital, was so very solicitous on my daughter’s account, for\nhaving no one to depend upon, that she despatched, at an early period,\nboats with men and women servants to come and fetch her. But my child\nwas at the time not quite over her illness, and that is why she has not\nyet started. I was, this very moment, cogitating to send my daughter to\nthe capital. And in view of the obligation, under which I am to you for\nthe instruction you have heretofore conferred upon her, remaining as yet\nunrequited, there is no reason why, when such an opportunity as this\npresents itself, I should not do my utmost to find means to make proper\nacknowledgment. I have already, in anticipation, given the matter my\nattention, and written a letter of recommendation to my brother-in-law,\nurging him to put everything right for you, in order that I may, to a\ncertain extent, be able to give effect to my modest wishes. As for any\noutlay that may prove necessary, I have given proper explanation, in the\nletter to my brother-in-law, so that you, my brother, need not trouble\nyourself by giving way to much anxiety.”",
        "As Yü-ts’un bowed and expressed his appreciation in most profuse\nlanguage,–",
        "“Pray,” he asked, “where does your honoured brother-in-law reside? and\nwhat is his official capacity? But I fear I’m too coarse in my manner,\nand could not presume to obtrude myself in his presence.”",
        "Ju-hai smiled. “And yet,” he remarked, “this brother-in-law of mine is\nafter all of one and the same family as your worthy self, for he is the\ngrandson of the Duke Jung. My elder brother-in-law has now inherited the\nstatus of Captain-General of the first grade. His name is She, his style\nNgen-hou. My second brother-in-law’s name is Cheng, his style is\nTzu-chou. His present post is that of a Second class Secretary in the\nBoard of Works. He is modest and kindhearted, and has much in him of the\nhabits of his grandfather; not one of that purse-proud and haughty kind\nof men. That is why I have written to him and made the request on your\nbehalf. Were he different to what he really is, not only would he cast a\nslur upon your honest purpose, honourable brother, but I myself likewise\nwould not have been as prompt in taking action.”",
        "When Yü-ts’un heard these remarks, he at length credited what had been\ntold him by Tzu-hsing the day before, and he lost no time in again\nexpressing his sense of gratitude to Lin Ju-hai.",
        "Ju-hai resumed the conversation.",
        "“I have fixed,” (he explained,) “upon the second of next month, for my\nyoung daughter’s departure for the capital, and, if you, brother mine,\nwere to travel along with her, would it not be an advantage to herself,\nas well as to yourself?”",
        "Yü-ts’un signified his acquiescence as he listened to his proposal;\nfeeling in his inner self extremely elated.",
        "Ju-hai availed himself of the earliest opportunity to get ready the\npresents (for the capital) and all the requirements for the journey,\nwhich (when completed,) Yü-ts’un took over one by one. His pupil could\nnot, at first, brook the idea, of a separation from her father, but the\npressing wishes of her grandmother left her no course (but to comply).",
        "“Your father,” Ju-hai furthermore argued with her, “is already fifty;\nand I entertain no wish to marry again; and then you are always ailing;\nbesides, with your extreme youth, you have, above, no mother of your own\nto take care of you, and below, no sisters to attend to you. If you now\ngo and have your maternal grandmother, as well as your mother’s brothers\nand your cousins to depend upon, you will be doing the best thing to\nreduce the anxiety which I feel in my heart on your behalf. Why then\nshould you not go?”",
        "Tai-yü, after listening to what her father had to say, parted from him\r\r\nin a flood of tears and followed her nurse and several old matrons from\nthe Jung mansion on board her boat, and set out on her journey.",
        "Yü-ts’un had a boat to himself, and with two youths to wait on him, he\nprosecuted his voyage in the wake of Tai-yü.",
        "By a certain day, they reached Ching Tu; and Yü-ts’un, after first\nadjusting his hat and clothes, came, attended by a youth, to the door of\nthe Jung mansion, and sent in a card, which showed his lineage.",
        "Chia Cheng had, by this time, perused his brother-in-law’s letter, and\nhe speedily asked him to walk in. When they met, he found in Yü-ts’un an\nimposing manner and polite address.",
        "This Chia Cheng had, in fact, a great penchant above all things for men\nof education, men courteous to the talented, respectful to the learned,\nready to lend a helping hand to the needy and to succour the distressed,\nand was, to a great extent, like his grandfather. As it was besides a\nwish intimated by his brother-in-law, he therefore treated Yü-ts’un with\na consideration still more unusual, and readily strained all his\nresources to assist him.",
        "On the very day on which the memorial was submitted to the Throne, he\nobtained by his efforts, a reinstatement to office, and before the\nexpiry of two months, Yü-t’sun was forthwith selected to fill the\nappointment of prefect of Ying T’ien in Chin Ling. Taking leave of Chia\nCheng, he chose a propitious day, and proceeded to his post, where we\nwill leave him without further notice for the present.",
        "But to return to Tai-yü. On the day on which she left the boat, and the\nmoment she put her foot on shore, there were forthwith at her disposal\nchairs for her own use, and carts for the luggage, sent over from the\nJung mansion.",
        "Lin Tai-yü had often heard her mother recount how different was her\ngrandmother’s house from that of other people’s; and having seen for\nherself how above the common run were already the attendants of the\nthree grades, (sent to wait upon her,) in attire, in their fare, in all\ntheir articles of use, “how much more,” (she thought to herself) “now\nthat I am going to her home, must I be careful at every step, and\ncircumspect at every moment! Nor must I utter one word too many, nor\nmake one step more than is proper, for fear lest I should be ridiculed\nby any of them!”",
        "From the moment she got into the chair, and they had entered within the\ncity walls, she found, as she looked around, through the gauze window,\nat the bustle in the streets and public places and at the immense\nconcourse of people, everything naturally so unlike what she had seen\nelsewhere.",
        "After they had also been a considerable time on the way, she suddenly\ncaught sight, at the northern end of the street, of two huge squatting\nlions of marble and of three lofty gates with (knockers representing)\nthe heads of animals. In front of these gates, sat, in a row, about ten\nmen in coloured hats and fine attire. The main gate was not open. It was\nonly through the side gates, on the east and west, that people went in\nand came out. Above the centre gate was a tablet. On this tablet were\ninscribed in five large characters–\"The Ning Kuo mansion erected by\nimperial command.”",
        "“This must be grandmother’s eldest son’s residence,” reflected Tai-yü.",
        "Towards the east, again, at no great distance, were three more high\ngateways, likewise of the same kind as those she had just seen. This was\nthe Jung Kuo mansion.",
        "They did not however go in by the main gate; but simply made their\nentrance through the east side door.",
        "With the sedans on their shoulders, (the bearers) proceeded about the\ndistance of the throw of an arrow, when upon turning a corner, they\nhastily put down the chairs. The matrons, who came behind, one and all\nalso dismounted. (The bearers) were changed for four youths of seventeen\nor eighteen, with hats and clothes without a blemish, and while they\ncarried the chair, the whole bevy of matrons followed on foot.",
        "When they reached a creeper-laden gate, the sedan was put down, and all\nthe youths stepped back and retired. The matrons came forward, raised\nthe screen, and supported Tai-yü to descend from the chair.",
        "Lin Tai-yü entered the door with the creepers, resting on the hand of a\nmatron.",
        "On both sides was a verandah, like two outstretched arms. An Entrance\nHall stood in the centre, in the middle of which was a door-screen of Ta\nLi marble, set in an ebony frame. On the other side of this screen were\nthree very small halls. At the back of these came at once an extensive\ncourtyard, belonging to the main building.",
        "In the front part were five parlours, the frieze of the ceiling of which\nwas all carved, and the pillars ornamented. On either side, were covered\navenues, resembling passages through a rock. In the side-rooms were\nsuspended cages, full of parrots of every colour, thrushes, and birds of\nevery description.",
        "On the terrace-steps, sat several waiting maids, dressed in red and\ngreen, and the whole company of them advanced, with beaming faces, to\ngreet them, when they saw the party approach. “Her venerable ladyship,\"\nthey said, “was at this very moment thinking of you, miss, and, by a\nstrange coincidence, here you are.”",
        "Three or four of them forthwith vied with each other in raising the door\ncurtain, while at the same time was heard some one announce: “Miss Lin\nhas arrived.”",
        "No sooner had she entered the room, than she espied two servants\nsupporting a venerable lady, with silver-white hair, coming forward to\ngreet her. Convinced that this lady must be her grandmother, she was\nabout to prostrate herself and pay her obeisance, when she was quickly\nclasped in the arms of her grandmother, who held her close against her\nbosom; and as she called her “my liver! my flesh!” (my love! my\ndarling!) she began to sob aloud.",
        "The bystanders too, at once, without one exception, melted into tears;\nand Tai-yü herself found some difficulty in restraining her sobs. Little\nby little the whole party succeeded in consoling her, and Tai-yü at\nlength paid her obeisance to her grandmother. Her ladyship thereupon\npointed them out one by one to Tai-yü. “This,” she said, “is the wife of\nyour uncle, your mother’s elder brother; this is the wife of your uncle,\nher second brother; and this is your eldest sister-in-law Chu, the wife\nof your senior cousin Chu.”",
        "Tai-yü bowed to each one of them (with folded arms).",
        "“Ask the young ladies in,” dowager lady Chia went on to say; “tell them\na guest from afar has just arrived, one who comes for the first time;\nand that they may not go to their lessons.”",
        "The servants with one voice signified their obedience, and two of them\nspeedily went to carry out her orders.",
        "Not long after three nurses and five or six waiting-maids were seen\nushering in three young ladies. The first was somewhat plump in figure\nand of medium height; her cheeks had a congealed appearance, like a\nfresh lichee; her nose was glossy like goose fat. She was gracious,\ndemure, and lovable to look at.",
        "The second had sloping shoulders, and a slim waist. Tall and slender was\nshe in stature, with a face like the egg of a goose. Her eyes so\nbeautiful, with their well-curved eyebrows, possessed in their gaze a\nbewitching flash. At the very sight of her refined and elegant manners\nall idea of vulgarity was forgotten.",
        "The third was below the medium size, and her mien was, as yet,\nchildlike.",
        "In their head ornaments, jewelry, and dress, the get-up of the three\nyoung ladies was identical.",
        "Tai-yü speedily rose to greet them and to exchange salutations. After\nthey had made each other’s acquaintance, they all took a seat, whereupon\nthe servants brought the tea. Their conversation was confined to\nTai-yü’s mother,–how she had fallen ill, what doctors had attended her,\nwhat medicines had been given her, and how she had been buried and\nmourned; and dowager lady Chia was naturally again in great anguish.",
        "“Of all my daughters,” she remarked, “your mother was the one I loved\nbest, and now in a twinkle, she has passed away, before me too, and I’ve\nnot been able to so much as see her face. How can this not make my heart\nsore-stricken?”",
        "And as she gave vent to these feelings, she took Tai-yü’s hand in hers,\nand again gave way to sobs; and it was only after the members of the\nfamily had quickly made use of much exhortation and coaxing, that they\nsucceeded, little by little, in stopping her tears.",
        "They all perceived that Tai-yü, despite her youthful years and\nappearance, was lady-like in her deportment and address, and that though\nwith her delicate figure and countenance, (she seemed as if) unable to\nbear the very weight of her clothes, she possessed, however, a certain\ncaptivating air. And as they readily noticed the symptoms of a weak\nconstitution, they went on in consequence to make inquiries as to what\nmedicines she ordinarily took, and how it was that her complaint had not\nbeen cured.",
        "“I have,” explained Tai-yü, “been in this state ever since I was born;\nthough I’ve taken medicines from the very time I was able to eat rice,\nup to the present, and have been treated by ever so many doctors of\nnote, I’ve not derived any benefit. In the year when I was yet only\nthree, I remember a mangy-headed bonze coming to our house, and saying\nthat he would take me along, and make a nun of me; but my father and\nmother would, on no account, give their consent. ’As you cannot bear to\npart from her and to give her up,’ he then remarked, ’her ailment will,\nI fear, never, throughout her life, be cured. If you wish to see her all\nright, it is only to be done by not letting her, from this day forward,\non any account, listen to the sound of weeping, or see, with the\nexception of her parents, any relatives outside the family circle. Then\nalone will she be able to go through this existence in peace and in\nquiet.’ No one heeded the nonsensical talk of this raving priest; but\nhere am I, up to this very day, dosing myself with ginseng pills as a\ntonic.”",
        "“What a lucky coincidence!” interposed dowager lady Chia; “some of these\npills are being compounded here, and I’ll simply tell them to have an\nextra supply made; that’s all.”",
        "Hardly had she finished these words, when a sound of laughter was heard\nfrom the back courtyard. “Here I am too late!” the voice said, “and not\nin time to receive the distant visitor!”",
        "“Every one of all these people,” reflected Tai-yü, “holds her peace and\nsuppresses the very breath of her mouth; and who, I wonder, is this\ncoming in this reckless and rude manner?”",
        "While, as yet, preoccupied with these thoughts, she caught sight of a\ncrowd of married women and waiting-maids enter from the back room,\npressing round a regular beauty.",
        "The attire of this person bore no similarity to that of the young\nladies. In all her splendour and lustre, she looked like a fairy or a\ngoddess. In her coiffure, she had a band of gold filigree work,\nrepresenting the eight precious things, inlaid with pearls; and wore\npins, at the head of each of which were five phoenixes in a rampant\nposition, with pendants of pearls. On her neck, she had a reddish gold\nnecklet, like coiled dragons, with a fringe of tassels. On her person,\nshe wore a tight-sleeved jacket, of dark red flowered satin, covered\nwith hundreds of butterflies, embroidered in gold, interspersed with\nflowers. Over all, she had a variegated stiff-silk pelisse, lined with\nslate-blue ermine; while her nether garments consisted of a jupe of\nkingfisher-colour foreign crepe, brocaded with flowers.",
        "She had a pair of eyes, triangular in shape like those of the red\nphoenix, two eyebrows, curved upwards at each temple, like willow\nleaves. Her stature was elegant; her figure graceful; her powdered face\nlike dawning spring, majestic, yet not haughty. Her carnation lips, long\nbefore they parted, betrayed a smile.",
        "Tai-yü eagerly rose and greeted her.",
        "Old lady Chia then smiled. “You don’t know her,” she observed. “This is\na cunning vixen, who has made quite a name in this establishment! In\nNanking, she went by the appellation of vixen, and if you simply call\nher Feng Vixen, it will do.”",
        "Tai-yü was just at a loss how to address her, when all her cousins\ninformed Tai-yü, that this was her sister-in-law Lien.",
        "Tai-yü had not, it is true, made her acquaintance before, but she had\nheard her mother mention that her eldest maternal uncle Chia She’s son,\nChia Lien, had married the niece of Madame Wang, her second brother’s\nwife, a girl who had, from her infancy, purposely been nurtured to\nsupply the place of a son, and to whom the school name of Wang Hsi-feng\nhad been given.",
        "Tai-yü lost no time in returning her smile and saluting her with all\npropriety, addressing her as my sister-in-law. This Hsi-feng laid hold\nof Tai-yü’s hand, and minutely scrutinised her, for a while, from head\nto foot; after which she led her back next to dowager lady Chia, where\nthey both took a seat.",
        "“If really there be a being of such beauty in the world,” she\nconsequently observed with a smile, “I may well consider as having set\neyes upon it to-day! Besides, in the air of her whole person, she\ndoesn’t in fact look like your granddaughter-in-law, our worthy\nancestor, but in every way like your ladyship’s own kindred-\ngranddaughter! It’s no wonder then that your venerable ladyship\nshould have, day after day, had her unforgotten, even for a second, in\nyour lips and heart. It’s a pity, however, that this cousin of mine\nshould have such a hard lot! How did it happen that our aunt died at\nsuch an early period?”",
        "As she uttered these words, she hastily took her handkerchief and wiped\nthe tears from her eyes.",
        "“I’ve only just recovered from a fit of crying,” dowager lady Chia\nobserved, as she smiled, “and have you again come to start me? Your\ncousin has only now arrived from a distant journey, and she is so\ndelicate to boot! Besides, we have a few minutes back succeeded in\ncoaxing her to restrain her sobs, so drop at once making any allusion to\nyour former remarks!”",
        "This Hsi-feng, upon hearing these words, lost no time in converting her\nsorrow into joy.",
        "“Quite right,” she remarked. “But at the sight of my cousin, my whole\nheart was absorbed in her, and I felt happy, and yet wounded at heart:\nbut having disregarded my venerable ancestor’s presence, I deserve to be\nbeaten, I do indeed!”",
        "And hastily taking once more Tai-yü’s hand in her own: “How old are you,\ncousin?” she inquired; “Have you been to school? What medicines are you\ntaking? while you live here, you mustn’t feel homesick; and if there’s\nanything you would like to eat, or to play with, mind you come and tell\nme! or should the waiting maids or the matrons fail in their duties,\ndon’t forget also to report them to me.”",
        "Addressing at the same time the matrons, she went on to ask, “Have Miss\nLin’s luggage and effects been brought in? How many servants has she\nbrought along with her? Go, as soon as you can, and sweep two lower\nrooms and ask them to go and rest.”",
        "As she spake, tea and refreshments had already been served, and Hsi-feng\nherself handed round the cups and offered the fruits.",
        "Upon hearing the question further put by her maternal aunt Secunda,\n“Whether the issue of the monthly allowances of money had been finished\nor not yet?” Hsi-feng replied: “The issue of the money has also been\ncompleted; but a few moments back, when I went along with several\nservants to the back upper-loft, in search of the satins, we looked for\never so long, but we saw nothing of the kind of satins alluded to by\nyou, madame, yesterday; so may it not be that your memory misgives you?”",
        "“Whether there be any or not, of that special kind, is of no\nconsequence,” observed madame Wang. “You should take out,” she therefore\nwent on to add, “any two pieces which first come under your hand, for\nthis cousin of yours to make herself dresses with; and in the evening,\nif I don’t forget, I’ll send some one to fetch them.”",
        "“I’ve in fact already made every provision,” rejoined Hsi-feng; “knowing\nvery well that my cousin would be arriving within these two days, I have\nhad everything got ready for her. And when you, madame, go back, if you\nwill pass an eye over everything, I shall be able to send them round.”",
        "Madame Wang gave a smile, nodded her head assentingly, but uttered not a\nword by way of reply.",
        "The tea and fruit had by this time been cleared, and dowager lady Chia\ndirected two old nurses to take Tai-yü to go and see her two maternal\nuncles; whereupon Chia She’s wife, madame Hsing, hastily stood up and\nwith a smiling face suggested, “I’ll take my niece over; for it will\nafter all be considerably better if I go!”",
        "“Quite so!” answered dowager lady Chia, smiling; “you can go home too,\nand there will be no need for you to come over again!”",
        "Madame Hsing expressed her assent, and forthwith led Tai-yü to take\nleave of madame Wang. The whole party escorted them as far as the door\nof the Entrance Hall, hung with creepers, where several youths had drawn\na carriage, painted light blue, with a kingfisher-coloured hood.",
        "Madame Hsing led Tai-yü by the hand and they got up into their seats.\nThe whole company of matrons put the curtain down, and then bade the\nyouths raise the carriage; who dragged it along, until they came to an\nopen space, where they at length put the mules into harness.",
        "Going out again by the eastern side gate, they proceeded in an easterly\ndirection, passed the main entrance of the Jung mansion, and entered a\nlofty doorway painted black. On the arrival in front of the ceremonial\ngate, they at once dismounted from the curricle, and madame Hsing,\nhand-in-hand with Tai-yü, walked into the court.",
        "“These grounds,” surmised Tai-yü to herself, “must have been originally\nconverted from a piece partitioned from the garden of the Jung mansion.”",
        "Having entered three rows of ceremonial gates they actually caught sight\nof the main structure, with its vestibules and porches, all of which,\nthough on a small scale, were full of artistic and unique beauty. They\nwere nothing like the lofty, imposing, massive and luxurious style of\narchitecture on the other side, yet the avenues and rockeries, in the\nvarious places in the court, were all in perfect taste.",
        "When they reached the interior of the principal pavilion, a large\nconcourse of handmaids and waiting maids, got up in gala dress, were\nalready there to greet them. Madame Hsing pressed Tai-yü into a seat,\nwhile she bade some one go into the outer library and request Mr. Chia\nShe to come over.",
        "In a few minutes the servant returned. “Master,” she explained, “says:\n’that he has not felt quite well for several days, that as the meeting\nwith Miss Lin will affect both her as well as himself, he does not for\nthe present feel equal to seeing each other, that he advises Miss Lin\nnot to feel despondent or homesick; that she ought to feel quite at home\nwith her venerable ladyship, (her grandmother,) as well as her maternal\naunts; that her cousins are, it is true, blunt, but that if all the\nyoung ladies associated together in one place, they may also perchance\ndispel some dulness; that if ever (Miss Lin) has any grievance, she\nshould at once speak out, and on no account feel a stranger; and\neverything will then be right.”",
        "Tai-yü lost no time in respectfully standing up, resuming her seat after\nshe had listened to every sentence of the message to her. After a while,\nshe said goodbye, and though madame Hsing used every argument to induce\nher to stay for the repast and then leave, Tai-yü smiled and said, “I\nshouldn’t under ordinary circumstances refuse the invitation to dinner,\nwhich you, aunt, in your love kindly extend to me, but I have still to\ncross over and pay my respects to my maternal uncle Secundus; if I went\ntoo late, it would, I fear, be a lack of respect on my part; but I shall\naccept on another occasion. I hope therefore that you will, dear aunt,\nkindly excuse me.”",
        "“If such be the case,” madame Hsing replied, “it’s all right.” And\npresently directing two nurses to take her niece over, in the carriage,\nin which they had come a while back, Tai-yü thereupon took her leave;\nmadame Hsing escorting her as far as the ceremonial gate, where she gave\nsome further directions to all the company of servants. She followed the\ncurricle with her eyes so long as it remained in sight, and at length\nretraced her footsteps.",
        "Tai-yü shortly entered the Jung Mansion, descended from the carriage,\nand preceded by all the nurses, she at once proceeded towards the east,\nturned a corner, passed through an Entrance Hall, running east and west,\nand walked in a southern direction, at the back of the Large Hall. On\nthe inner side of a ceremonial gate, and at the upper end of a spacious\ncourt, stood a large main building, with five apartments, flanked on\nboth sides by out-houses (stretching out) like the antlers on the head\nof deer; side-gates, resembling passages through a hill, establishing a\nthorough communication all round; (a main building) lofty, majestic,\nsolid and grand, and unlike those in the compound of dowager lady Chia.",
        "Tai-yü readily concluded that this at last was the main inner suite of\napartments. A raised broad road led in a straight line to the large\ngate. Upon entering the Hall, and raising her head, she first of all\nperceived before her a large tablet with blue ground, upon which figured\nnine dragons of reddish gold. The inscription on this tablet consisted\nof three characters as large as a peck-measure, and declared that this\nwas the Hall of Glorious Felicity.",
        "At the end, was a row of characters of minute size, denoting the year,\nmonth and day, upon which His Majesty had been pleased to confer the\ntablet upon Chia Yuan, Duke of Jung Kuo. Besides this tablet, were\nnumberless costly articles bearing the autograph of the Emperor. On the\nlarge black ebony table, engraved with dragons, were placed three\nantique blue and green bronze tripods, about three feet in height. On\nthe wall hung a large picture representing black dragons, such as were\nseen in waiting chambers of the Sui dynasty. On one side stood a gold\ncup of chased work, while on the other, a crystal casket. On the ground\nwere placed, in two rows, sixteen chairs, made of hard-grained cedar.",
        "There was also a pair of scrolls consisting of black-wood antithetical\ntablets, inlaid with the strokes of words in chased gold. Their burden\nwas this:",
        "  On the platform shine resplendent pearls like sun or moon,\n  And the sheen of the Hall façade gleams like russet sky.",
        "Below, was a row of small characters, denoting that the scroll had been\nwritten by the hand of Mu Shih, a fellow-countryman and old friend of\nthe family, who, for his meritorious services, had the hereditary title\nof Prince of Tung Ngan conferred upon him.",
        "The fact is that madame Wang was also not in the habit of sitting and\nresting, in this main apartment, but in three side-rooms on the east, so\nthat the nurses at once led Tai-yü through the door of the eastern wing.\r",
        "On a stove-couch, near the window, was spread a foreign red carpet. On\nthe side of honour, were laid deep red reclining-cushions, with dragons,\nwith gold cash (for scales), and an oblong brown-coloured\nsitting-cushion with gold-cash-spotted dragons. On the two sides, stood\none of a pair of small teapoys of foreign lacquer of peach-blossom\npattern. On the teapoy on the left, were spread out Wen Wang tripods,\nspoons, chopsticks and scent-bottles. On the teapoy on the right, were\nvases from the Ju Kiln, painted with girls of great beauty, in which\nwere placed seasonable flowers; (on it were) also teacups, a tea service\nand the like articles.",
        "On the floor on the west side of the room, were four chairs in a row,\nall of which were covered with antimacassars, embroidered with\nsilverish-red flowers, while below, at the feet of these chairs, stood\nfour footstools. On either side, was also one of a pair of high teapoys,\nand these teapoys were covered with teacups and flower vases.",
        "The other nick-nacks need not be minutely described.",
        "The old nurses pressed Tai-yü to sit down on the stove-couch; but, on\nperceiving near the edge of the couch two embroidered cushions, placed\none opposite the other, she thought of the gradation of seats, and did\nnot therefore place herself on the couch, but on a chair on the eastern\nside of the room; whereupon the waiting maids, in attendance in these\nquarters, hastened to serve the tea.",
        "While Tai-yü was sipping her tea, she observed the headgear, dress,\ndeportment and manners of the several waiting maids, which she really\nfound so unlike what she had seen in other households. She had hardly\nfinished her tea, when she noticed a waiting maid approach, dressed in a\nred satin jacket, and a waistcoat of blue satin with scollops.",
        "“My lady requests Miss Lin to come over and sit with her,” she remarked\nas she put on a smile.",
        "The old nurses, upon hearing this message, speedily ushered Tai-yü again\nout of this apartment, into the three-roomed small main building by the\neastern porch.",
        "On the stove-couch, situated at the principal part of the room, was\nplaced, in a transverse position, a low couch-table, at the upper end of\nwhich were laid out, in a heap, books and a tea service. Against the\npartition-wall, on the east side, facing the west, was a reclining\npillow, made of blue satin, neither old nor new.",
        "Madame Wang, however, occupied the lower seat, on the west side, on\nwhich was likewise placed a rather shabby blue satin sitting-rug, with a\nback-cushion; and upon perceiving Tai-yü come in she urged her at once\nto sit on the east side.",
        "Tai-yü concluded, in her mind, that this seat must certainly belong to\nChia Cheng, and espying, next to the couch, a row of three chairs,\ncovered with antimacassars, strewn with embroidered flowers, somewhat\nalso the worse for use, Tai-yü sat down on one of these chairs.",
        "But as madame Wang pressed her again and again to sit on the couch,\nTai-yü had at length to take a seat next to her.",
        "“Your uncle,” madame Wang explained, “is gone to observe this day as a\nfast day, but you’ll see him by and bye. There’s, however, one thing I\nwant to talk to you about. Your three female cousins are all, it is\ntrue, everything that is nice; and you will, when later on you come\ntogether for study, or to learn how to do needlework, or whenever, at\nany time, you romp and laugh together, find them all most obliging; but\nthere’s one thing that causes me very much concern. I have here one, who\nis the very root of retribution, the incarnation of all mischief, one\nwho is a ne’er-do-well, a prince of malignant spirits in this family. He\nis gone to-day to pay his vows in the temple, and is not back yet, but\nyou will see him in the evening, when you will readily be able to judge\nfor yourself. One thing you must do, and that is, from this time forth,\nnot to pay any notice to him. All these cousins of yours don’t venture\nto bring any taint upon themselves by provoking him.”",
        "Tai-yü had in days gone by heard her mother explain that she had a\nnephew, born into the world, holding a piece of jade in his mouth, who\nwas perverse beyond measure, who took no pleasure in his books, and\nwhose sole great delight was to play the giddy dog in the inner\napartments; that her maternal grandmother, on the other hand, loved him\nso fondly that no one ever presumed to call him to account, so that\nwhen, in this instance, she heard madame Wang’s advice, she at once felt\ncertain that it must be this very cousin.",
        "“Isn’t it to the cousin born with jade in his mouth, that you are\nalluding to, aunt?” she inquired as she returned her smile. “When I was\nat home, I remember my mother telling me more than once of this very\ncousin, who (she said) was a year older than I, and whose infant name\nwas Pao-yü. She added that his disposition was really wayward, but that\nhe treats all his cousins with the utmost consideration. Besides, now\nthat I have come here, I shall, of course, be always together with my\nfemale cousins, while the boys will have their own court, and separate\nquarters; and how ever will there be any cause of bringing any slur upon\nmyself by provoking him?”",
        "“You don’t know the reasons (that prompt me to warn you),” replied\nmadame Wang laughingly. “He is so unlike all the rest, all because he\nhas, since his youth up, been doated upon by our old lady! The fact is\nthat he has been spoilt, through over-indulgence, by being always in the\ncompany of his female cousins! If his female cousins pay no heed to him,\nhe is, at any rate, somewhat orderly, but the day his cousins say one\nword more to him than usual, much trouble forthwith arises, at the\noutburst of delight in his heart. That’s why I enjoin upon you not to\nheed him. From his mouth, at one time, issue sugared words and\nmellifluous phrases; and at another, like the heavens devoid of the sun,\nhe becomes a raving fool; so whatever you do, don’t believe all he\nsays.”",
        "Tai-yü was assenting to every bit of advice as it was uttered, when\nunexpectedly she beheld a waiting-maid walk in. “Her venerable ladyship\nover there,” she said, “has sent word about the evening meal.”",
        "Madame Wang hastily took Tai-yü by the hand, and emerging by the door of\nthe back-room, they went eastwards by the verandah at the back. Past the\nside gate, was a roadway, running north and south. On the southern side\nwere a pavilion with three divisions and a Reception Hall with a\ncolonnade. On the north, stood a large screen wall, painted white;\nbehind it was a very small building, with a door of half the ordinary\nsize.",
        "“These are your cousin Feng’s rooms,” explained madame Wang to Tai-yü,\nas she pointed to them smiling. “You’ll know in future your way to come\nand find her; and if you ever lack anything, mind you mention it to her,\nand she’ll make it all right.”",
        "At the door of this court, were also several youths, who had recently\nhad the tufts of their hair tied together, who all dropped their hands\nagainst their sides, and stood in a respectful posture. Madame Wang then\nled Tai-yü by the hand through a corridor, running east and west, into\nwhat was dowager lady Chia’s back-court. Forthwith they entered the door\nof the back suite of rooms, where stood, already in attendance, a large\nnumber of servants, who, when they saw madame Wang arrive, set to work\nsetting the tables and chairs in order.",
        "Chia Chu’s wife, née Li, served the eatables, while Hsi-feng placed the\nchopsticks, and madame Wang brought the soup in. Dowager lady Chia was\nseated all alone on the divan, in the main part of the apartment, on the\ntwo sides of which stood four vacant chairs.",
        "Hsi-feng at once drew Tai-yü, meaning to make her sit in the foremost\nchair on the left side, but Tai-yü steadily and concedingly declined.",
        "“Your aunts and sisters-in-law, standing on the right and left,” dowager\nlady Chia smilingly explained, “won’t have their repast in here, and as\nyou’re a guest, it’s but proper that you should take that seat.”",
        "Then alone it was that Tai-yü asked for permission to sit down, seating\nherself on the chair.",
        "Madame Wang likewise took a seat at old lady Chia’s instance; and the\nthree cousins, Ying Ch’un and the others, having craved for leave to sit\ndown, at length came forward, and Ying Ch’un took the first chair on the\nright, T’an Ch’un the second, and Hsi Ch’un the second on the left.\nWaiting maids stood by holding in their hands, flips and finger-bowls\nand napkins, while Mrs. Li and lady Feng, the two of them, kept near the\ntable advising them what to eat, and pressing them to help themselves.",
        "In the outer apartments, the married women and waiting-maids in\nattendance, were, it is true, very numerous; but not even so much as the\nsound of the cawing of a crow could be heard.",
        "The repast over, each one was presented by a waiting-maid, with tea in a\nsmall tea tray; but the Lin family had all along impressed upon the mind\nof their daughter that in order to show due regard to happiness, and to\npreserve good health, it was essential, after every meal, to wait a\nwhile, before drinking any tea, so that it should not do any harm to the\nintestines. When, therefore, Tai-yü perceived how many habits there were\nin this establishment unlike those which prevailed in her home, she too\nhad no alternative but to conform herself to a certain extent with them.\nUpon taking over the cup of tea, servants came once more and presented\nfinger-bowls for them to rinse their mouths, and Tai-yü also rinsed\nhers; and after they had all again finished washing their hands, tea was\neventually served a second time, and this was, at length, the tea that\nwas intended to be drunk.",
        "“You can all go,” observed dowager lady Chia, “and let us alone to have\na chat.”",
        "Madame Wang rose as soon as she heard these words, and having made a few\nirrelevant remarks, she led the way and left the room along with the two\nladies, Mrs. Li and lady Feng.",
        "Dowager lady Chia, having inquired of Tai-yü what books she was reading,\n“I have just begun reading the Four Books,” Tai-yü replied. “What books\nare my cousins reading?” Tai-yü went on to ask.",
        "“Books, you say!” exclaimed dowager lady Chia; “why all they know are a\nfew characters, that’s all.”",
        "The sentence was barely out of her lips, when a continuous sounding of\nfootsteps was heard outside, and a waiting maid entered and announced\nthat Pao-yü was coming. Tai-yü was speculating in her mind how it was\nthat this Pao-yü had turned out such a good-for-nothing fellow, when he\nhappened to walk in.",
        "He was, in fact, a young man of tender years, wearing on his head, to\nhold his hair together, a cap of gold of purplish tinge, inlaid with\nprecious gems. Parallel with his eyebrows was attached a circlet,\nembroidered with gold, and representing two dragons snatching a pearl.\nHe wore an archery-sleeved deep red jacket, with hundreds of butterflies\nworked in gold of two different shades, interspersed with flowers; and\nwas girded with a sash of variegated silk, with clusters of designs, to\nwhich was attached long tassels; a kind of sash worn in the palace. Over\nall, he had a slate-blue fringed coat of Japanese brocaded satin, with\neight bunches of flowers in relief; and wore a pair of light blue satin\nwhite-soled, half-dress court-shoes.",
        "His face was like the full moon at mid-autumn; his complexion, like\nmorning flowers in spring; the hair along his temples, as if chiselled\nwith a knife; his eyebrows, as if pencilled with ink; his nose like a\nsuspended gallbladder (a well-cut and shapely nose); his eyes like\nvernal waves; his angry look even resembled a smile; his glance, even\nwhen stern, was full of sentiment.",
        "Round his neck he had a gold dragon necklet with a fringe; also a cord\nof variegated silk, to which was attached a piece of beautiful jade.",
        "As soon as Tai-yü became conscious of his presence, she was quite taken\naback. “How very strange!” she was reflecting in her mind; “it would\nseem as if I had seen him somewhere or other, for his face appears\nextremely familiar to my eyes;” when she noticed Pao-yü face dowager\nlady Chia and make his obeisance. “Go and see your mother and then come\nback,” remarked her venerable ladyship; and at once he turned round and\nquitted the room.",
        "On his return, he had already changed his hat and suit. All round his\nhead, he had a fringe of short hair, plaited into small queues, and\nbound with red silk. The queues were gathered up at the crown, and all\nthe hair, which had been allowed to grow since his birth, was plaited\ninto a thick queue, which looked as black and as glossy as lacquer.\nBetween the crown of the head and the extremity of the queue, hung a\nstring of four large pearls, with pendants of gold, representing the\neight precious things. On his person, he wore a long silvery-red coat,\nmore or less old, bestrewn with embroidery of flowers. He had still\nround his neck the necklet, precious gem, amulet of Recorded Name,\nphilacteries, and other ornaments. Below were partly visible a fir-cone\ncoloured brocaded silk pair of trousers, socks spotted with black\ndesigns, with ornamented edges, and a pair of deep red, thick-soled\nshoes.",
        "(Got up as he was now,) his face displayed a still whiter appearance, as\nif painted, and his eyes as if they were set off with carnation. As he\nrolled his eyes, they brimmed with love. When he gave utterance to\nspeech, he seemed to smile. But the chief natural pleasing feature was\nmainly centred in the curve of his eyebrows. The ten thousand and one\nfond sentiments, fostered by him during the whole of his existence, were\nall amassed in the corner of his eyes.",
        "His outward appearance may have been pleasing to the highest degree, but\nyet it was no easy matter to fathom what lay beneath it.",
        "There are a couple of roundelays, composed by a later poet, (after the\nexcellent rhythm of the) Hsi Chiang Yueh, which depict Pao-yü in a most\nadequate manner.",
        "The roundelays run as follows:",
        "  To gloom and passion prone, without a rhyme,\n  Inane and madlike was he many a time,\n  His outer self, forsooth, fine may have been,\n  But one wild, howling waste his mind within:\r\n  Addled his brain that nothing he could see;\n  A dunce! to read essays so loth to be!\n  Perverse in bearing, in temper wayward;\n  For human censure he had no regard.\n  When rich, wealth to enjoy he knew not how;\n  When poor, to poverty he could not bow.\n  Alas! what utter waste of lustrous grace!\n  To state, to family what a disgrace!\n  Of ne’er-do-wells below he was the prime,\n  Unfilial like him none up to this time.\n  Ye lads, pampered with sumptuous fare and dress,\n  Beware! In this youth’s footsteps do not press!",
        "But to proceed with our story.",
        "“You have gone and changed your clothes,” observed dowager lady Chia,\n“before being introduced to the distant guest. Why don’t you yet salute\nyour cousin?”",
        "Pao-yü had long ago become aware of the presence of a most beautiful\nyoung lady, who, he readily concluded, must be no other than the\ndaughter of his aunt Lin. He hastened to advance up to her, and make his\nbow; and after their introduction, he resumed his seat, whence he\nminutely scrutinised her features, (which he thought) so unlike those of\nall other girls.",
        "Her two arched eyebrows, thick as clustered smoke, bore a certain not\nvery pronounced frowning wrinkle. She had a pair of eyes, which\npossessed a cheerful, and yet one would say, a sad expression,\noverflowing with sentiment. Her face showed the prints of sorrow stamped\non her two dimpled cheeks. She was beautiful, but her whole frame was\nthe prey of a hereditary disease. The tears in her eyes glistened like\nsmall specks. Her balmy breath was so gentle. She was as demure as a\nlovely flower reflected in the water. Her gait resembled a frail willow,\nagitated by the wind. Her heart, compared with that of Pi Kan, had one\nmore aperture of intelligence; while her ailment exceeded (in intensity)\nby three degrees the ailment of Hsi-Tzu.",
        "Pao-yü, having concluded his scrutiny of her, put on a smile and said,\n“This cousin I have already seen in days gone by.”",
        "“There you are again with your nonsense,” exclaimed lady Chia,\nsneeringly; “how could you have seen her before?”",
        "“Though I may not have seen her, ere this,” observed Pao-yü with a\nsmirk, “yet when I look at her face, it seems so familiar, and to my\nmind, it would appear as if we had been old acquaintances; just as if,\nin fact, we were now meeting after a long separation.”",
        "“That will do! that will do!” remarked dowager lady Chia; “such being\nthe case, you will be the more intimate.”",
        "Pao-yü, thereupon, went up to Tai-yü, and taking a seat next to her,\ncontinued to look at her again with all intentness for a good long\nwhile.",
        "“Have you read any books, cousin?” he asked.",
        "“I haven’t as yet,” replied Tai-yü, “read any books, as I have only been\nto school for a year; all I know are simply a few characters.”",
        "“What is your worthy name, cousin?” Pao-yü went on to ask; whereupon\nTai-yü speedily told him her name.",
        "“Your style?” inquired Pao-yü; to which question Tai-yü replied, “I have\nno style.”",
        "“I’ll give you a style,” suggested Pao-yü smilingly; “won’t the double\nstyle ’P’in P’in,’ ’knitting brows,’ do very well?”",
        "“From what part of the standard books does that come?” T’an Ch’un\nhastily interposed.",
        "“It is stated in the Thorough Research into the state of Creation from\nremote ages to the present day,” Pao-yü went on to explain, “that, in\nthe western quarter, there exists a stone, called Tai, (black,) which\ncan be used, in lieu of ink, to blacken the eyebrows with. Besides the\neyebrows of this cousin taper in a way, as if they were contracted, so\nthat the selection of these two characters is most appropriate, isn’t\nit?”",
        "“This is just another plagiarism, I fear,” observed T’an Ch’un, with an\nironic smirk.",
        "“Exclusive of the Four Books,” Pao-yü remarked smilingly, “the majority\nof works are plagiarised; and is it only I, perchance, who plagiarise?\nHave you got any jade or not?” he went on to inquire, addressing Tai-yü,\n(to the discomfiture) of all who could not make out what he meant.",
        "“It’s because he has a jade himself,” Tai-yü forthwith reasoned within\nher mind, “that he asks me whether I have one or not.–No; I haven’t\none,” she replied. “That jade of yours is besides a rare object, and how\ncould every one have one?”",
        "As soon as Pao-yü heard this remark, he at once burst out in a fit of\nhis raving complaint, and unclasping the gem, he dashed it disdainfully\non the floor. “Rare object, indeed!” he shouted, as he heaped invective\non it; “it has no idea how to discriminate the excellent from the mean,\namong human beings; and do tell me, has it any perception or not? I too\ncan do without this rubbish!”",
        "All those, who stood below, were startled; and in a body they pressed\nforward, vying with each other as to who should pick up the gem.",
        "Dowager lady Chia was so distressed that she clasped Pao-yü in her\nembrace. “You child of wrath,” she exclaimed. “When you get into a\npassion, it’s easy enough for you to beat and abuse people; but what\nmakes you fling away that stem of life?”",
        "Pao-yü’s face was covered with the traces of tears. “All my cousins\nhere, senior as well as junior,” he rejoined, as he sobbed, “have no\ngem, and if it’s only I to have one, there’s no fun in it, I maintain!\nand now comes this angelic sort of cousin, and she too has none, so that\nit’s clear enough that it is no profitable thing.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia hastened to coax him. “This cousin of yours,” she\nexplained, “would, under former circumstances, have come here with a\njade; and it’s because your aunt felt unable, as she lay on her\ndeath-bed, to reconcile herself to the separation from your cousin, that\nin the absence of any remedy, she forthwith took the gem belonging to\nher (daughter), along with her (in the grave); so that, in the first\nplace, by the fulfilment of the rites of burying the living with the\ndead might be accomplished the filial piety of your cousin; and in the\nsecond place, that the spirit of your aunt might also, for the time\nbeing, use it to gratify the wish of gazing on your cousin. That’s why\nshe simply told you that she had no jade; for she couldn’t very well\nhave had any desire to give vent to self-praise. Now, how can you ever\ncompare yourself with her? and don’t you yet carefully and circumspectly\nput it on? Mind, your mother may come to know what you have done!”",
        "As she uttered these words, she speedily took the jade over from the\nhand of the waiting-maid, and she herself fastened it on for him.",
        "When Pao-yü heard this explanation, he indulged in reflection, but could\nnot even then advance any further arguments.",
        "A nurse came at the moment and inquired about Tai-yü’s quarters, and\ndowager lady Chia at once added, “Shift Pao-yü along with me, into the\nwarm room of my suite of apartments, and put your mistress, Miss Lin,\ntemporarily in the green gauze house; and when the rest of the winter is\nover, and repairs are taken in hand in spring in their rooms, an\nadditional wing can be put up for her to take up her quarters in.”",
        "“My dear ancestor,” ventured Pao-yü; “the bed I occupy outside the green\ngauze house is very comfortable; and what need is there again for me to\nleave it and come and disturb your old ladyship’s peace and quiet?”",
        "“Well, all right,” observed dowager lady Chia, after some consideration;\n“but let each one of you have a nurse, as well as a waiting-maid to\nattend on you; the other servants can remain in the outside rooms and\nkeep night watch and be ready to answer any call.”",
        "At an early hour, besides, Hsi-feng had sent a servant round with a grey\nflowered curtain, embroidered coverlets and satin quilts and other such\narticles.",
        "Tai-yü had brought along with her only two servants; the one was her own\nnurse, dame Wang, and the other was a young waiting-maid of sixteen,\nwhose name was called Hsüeh Yen. Dowager lady Chia, perceiving that\nHsüeh Yen was too youthful and quite a child in her manner, while nurse\nWang was, on the other hand, too aged, conjectured that Tai-yü would, in\nall her wants, not have things as she liked, so she detached two\nwaiting-maids, who were her own personal attendants, named Tzu Chüan and\nYing Ko, and attached them to Tai-yü’s service. Just as had Ying Ch’un\nand the other girls, each one of whom had besides the wet nurses of\ntheir youth, four other nurses to advise and direct them, and exclusive\nof two personal maids to look after their dress and toilette, four or\nfive additional young maids to do the washing and sweeping of the rooms\nand the running about backwards and forwards on errands.",
        "Nurse Wang, Tzu Chüan and other girls entered at once upon their\nattendance on Tai-yü in the green gauze rooms, while Pao-yü’s wet-nurse,\ndame Li, together with an elderly waiting-maid, called Hsi Jen, were on\nduty in the room with the large bed.",
        "This Hsi Jen had also been, originally, one of dowager lady Chia’s\nservant-girls. Her name was in days gone by, Chen Chu. As her venerable\nladyship, in her tender love for Pao-yü, had feared that Pao-yü’s\nservant girls were not equal to their duties, she readily handed her to\nPao-yü, as she had hitherto had experience of how sincere and\nconsiderate she was at heart.",
        "Pao-yü, knowing that her surname was at one time Hua, and having once\nseen in some verses of an ancient poet, the line “the fragrance of\nflowers wafts itself into man,” lost no time in explaining the fact to\ndowager lady Chia, who at once changed her name into Hsi Jen.",
        "This Hsi Jen had several simple traits. While in attendance upon dowager\nlady Chia, in her heart and her eyes there was no one but her venerable\nladyship, and her alone; and now in her attendance upon Pao-yü, her\nheart and her eyes were again full of Pao-yü, and him alone. But as\nPao-yü was of a perverse temperament and did not heed her repeated\ninjunctions, she felt at heart exceedingly grieved.",
        "At night, after nurse Li had fallen asleep, seeing that in the inner\nchambers, Tai-yü, Ying Ko and the others had not as yet retired to rest,\nshe disrobed herself, and with gentle step walked in.",
        "“How is it, miss,” she inquired smiling, “that you have not turned in as\nyet?”",
        "Tai-yü at once put on a smile. “Sit down, sister,” she rejoined,\npressing her to take a seat. Hsi Jen sat on the edge of the bed.",
        "“Miss Lin,” interposed Ying Ko smirkingly, “has been here in an awful\nstate of mind! She has cried so to herself, that her eyes were flooded,\nas soon as she dried her tears. ’It’s only to-day that I’ve come,’ she\nsaid, ’and I’ve already been the cause of the outbreak of your young\nmaster’s failing. Now had he broken that jade, as he hurled it on the\nground, wouldn’t it have been my fault? Hence it was that she was so\nwounded at heart, that I had all the trouble in the world, before I\ncould appease her.”",
        "“Desist at once, Miss! Don’t go on like this,” Hsi Jen advised her;\n“there will, I fear, in the future, happen things far more strange and\nridiculous than this; and if you allow yourself to be wounded and\naffected to such a degree by a conduct such as his, you will, I\napprehend, suffer endless wounds and anguish; so be quick and dispel\nthis over-sensitive nature!”",
        "“What you sisters advise me,” replied Tai-yü, “I shall bear in mind, and\nit will be all right.”",
        "They had another chat, which lasted for some time, before they at length\nretired to rest for the night.",
        "The next day, (she and her cousins) got up at an early hour and went\nover to pay their respects to dowager lady Chia, after which upon coming\nto madame Wang’s apartments, they happened to find madame Wang and\nHsi-feng together, opening the letters which had arrived from Chin Ling.\nThere were also in the room two married women, who had been sent from\nmadame Wang’s elder brother’s wife’s house to deliver a message.",
        "Tai-yü was, it is true, not aware of what was up, but T’an Ch’un and the\nothers knew that they were discussing the son of her mother’s sister,\nmarried in the Hsüeh family, in the city of Chin Ling, a cousin of\ntheirs, Hsüeh P’an, who relying upon his wealth and influence had, by\nassaulting a man, committed homicide, and who was now to be tried in the\ncourt of the Ying T’ien Prefecture.",
        "Her maternal uncle, Wang Tzu-t’eng, had now, on the receipt of the\ntidings, despatched messengers to bring over the news to the Chia\nfamily. But the next chapter will explain what was the ultimate issue of\nthe wish entertained in this mansion to send for the Hsüeh family to\ncome to the capital.",
