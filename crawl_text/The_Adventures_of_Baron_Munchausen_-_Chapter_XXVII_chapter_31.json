        "  A proclamation by the Baron–Excessive curiosity of the people to\n  know what fudge was–The people in a general ferment about it–\n  They break open all the granaries in the empire–The affections of\n  the people conciliated–An ode performed in honour of the Baron–\n  His discourse with Fragrantia on the excellence of the music.",
        "Some time after I ordered the following proclamation to be published\nin the Court Gazette, and in all the other papers of the empire:–",
        "  BY THE MOST MIGHTY AND PUISSANT LORD,\n  HIS EXCELLENCY THE\n  LORD BARON MUNCHAUSEN.",
        "  Whereas a quantity of fudge has been distributed through all the\n  granaries of the empire for particular uses; and as the natives\n  have ever expressed their aversion to all manner of European\n  eatables, it is hereby strictly forbidden, under pain of the\n  severest penalties, for any of the officers charged with the\n  keeping of the said fudge to give, sell, or suffer to be sold, any\n  part or quantity whatever of the said material, until it be\n  agreeable unto our good will and pleasure.",
        "  Dated in our Castle of Gristariska\n    this Triskill of the month of\n    Griskish, in the year Moulikasra-\n    navas-kashna-vildash.",
        "This proclamation excited the most ardent curiosity all over the\nempire. “Do you know what this fudge is?” said Lady Mooshilgarousti to\nLord Darnarlaganl. “Fudge!” said he, “Fudge! no: what fudge?” “I\nmean,” replied her Ladyship, “the enormous quantity of fudge that has\nbeen distributed under guards in all the strong places in the empire,\nand which is strictly forbidden to be sold or given to any of the\nnatives under the severest penalties.” “Lord!” replied he, “what in\nthe name of wonder can it be? Forbidden! why it must, but pray do you,\nLady Fashashash, do you know what this fudge is? Do you, Lord\nTrastillauex? or you, Miss Gristilarkask? What! nobody know what this\nfudge can be?”",
        "It engrossed for several days the chit-chat of the whole empire.\nFudge, fudge, fudge, resounded in all companies and in all places,\nfrom the rising until the setting of the sun; and even at night, when\ngentle sleep refreshed the rest of mortals, the ladies of all that\ncountry were dreaming of fudge!",
        "“Upon my honour,” said Kitty, as she was adjusting her modesty piece\nbefore the glass, just after getting out of bed, “there is scarce\nanything I would not give to know what this fudge can be.” “La! my\ndear,” replied Miss Killnariska, “I have been dreaming the whole night\nof nothing but fudge; I thought my lover kissed my hand, and pressed\nit to his bosom, while I, frowning, endeavoured to wrest it from him:\nthat he kneeled at my feet. No, never, never will I look at you, cried\nI, till you tell me what this fudge can be, or get me some of it.\nBegone! cried I, with all the dignity of offended beauty, majesty, and\na tragic queen. Begone! never see me more, or bring me this delicious\nfudge. He swore, on the honour of a knight, that he would wander o’er\nthe world, encounter every danger, perish in the attempt, or satisfy\nthe angel of his soul.”",
        "The chiefs and nobility of the nation, when they met together to drink\ntheir kava, spoke of nothing but fudge. Men, women, and children all,\nall talked of nothing but fudge. ’Twas a fury of curiosity, one\ngeneral ferment, and universal fever–nothing but fudge could allay\nit.",
        "But in one respect they all agreed, that government must have had some\ninterested view, in giving such positive orders to preserve it, and\nkeep it from the natives of the country. Petitions were addressed to\nme from all quarters, from every corporation and body of men in the\nwhole empire. The majority of the people instructed their\nconstituents, and the parliament presented a petition, praying that I\nwould be pleased to take the state of the nation under consideration,\nand give orders to satisfy the people, or the most dreadful\nconsequences were to be apprehended. To these requests, at the\nentreaty of my council, I made no reply, or at best but unsatisfactory\nanswers. Curiosity was on the rack; they forgot to lampoon the\ngovernment, so engaged were they about the fudge. The great assembly\nof the states could think of nothing else. Instead of enacting laws\nfor the regulation of the people, instead of consulting what should\nseem most wise, most excellent, they could think, talk, and harangue\nof nothing but fudge. In vain did the Speaker call to order; the more\nchecks they got the more extravagant and inquisitive they were.",
        "In short, the populace in many places rose in the most outrageous and\ntumultuous manner, forced open the granaries in all places in one day,\nand triumphantly distributed the fudge through the whole empire.",
        "Whether on account of the longing, the great curiosity, imagination,\nor the disposition of the people, I cannot say–but they found it\ninfinitely to their taste; ’twas intoxication of joy, satisfaction,\nand applause.",
        "Finding how much they liked this fudge, I procured another quantity\nfrom England, much greater than the former, and cautiously bestowed it\nover all the kingdom. Thus were the affections of the people regained;\nand they, from hence, began to venerate, applaud, and admire my\ngovernment more than ever. The following ode was performed at the\ncastle, in the most superb style, and universally admired:–",
