        "A fire in a country village, particularly where the building is a\nprominent one, is sure to attract a large part of the resident\npopulation.  Men, women, and children, as well as the hook and ladder\ncompany, hurried to the scene of conflagration.  Everybody felt a\npersonal interest in Crawford’s.  It was the great emporium which\nprovided all the families in the village with articles of prime and\nsecondary necessity.  If Paris can be called France, then Crawford’s\nmight be called Pentonville.",
        "“Crawford’s on fire!” exclaimed old Captain Manson.  “Bless my soul!\nIt cannot be true.  Where’s my cane?”",
        "“You don’t mean to say you’re goin’ to the fire, father?” asked his\nwidowed daughter in surprise, for the captain had bowed beneath the\nweight of eighty-six winters, and rarely left the domestic hearth.",
        "“Do you think I’d stay at home when Crawford’s was a-burning?\"\nreturned the captain.",
        "“But remember, father, you ain’t so young as you used to be.  You\nmight catch your death of cold.”",
        "“What!  at a fire?” exclaimed the old man, laughing at his own joke.",
        "“You know what I mean.  It’s dreadfully imprudent.  Why, I wouldn’t go\nmyself.”",
        "“Shouldn’t think you would, at your time of life!” retorted her\nfather, chuckling.",
        "So the old man emerged into the street, and hurried as fast as his\nunsteady limbs would allow, to the fire.",
        "“How did it catch?” the reader will naturally ask.",
        "The young man who was the only other salesman besides Ben and the\nproprietor, had gone down cellar smoking a cigar.  In one corner was a\nheap of shavings and loose papers.  A spark from his cigar must have\nfallen there.  Had he noticed it, with prompt measures the incipient\nfire might have been extinguished.  But he went up stairs with the\nkerosene, which he had drawn for old Mrs. Watts, leaving behind him\nthe seeds of destruction.  Soon the flames, arising, caught the wooden\nflooring of the upper store.  The smell of the smoke notified Crawford\nand his clerks of the impending disaster.  When the door communicating\nwith the basement was opened, a stifling smoke issued forth and the\ncrackling of the fire was heard.",
        "“Run, Ben; give the alarm!” called Mr. Crawford, pale with dismay and\napprehension.  It was no time then to inquire how the fire caught.\nThere was only time to save as much of the stock as possible, since it\nwas clear that the fire had gained too great a headway to be put out.",
        "Ben lost no time, and in less than ten minutes the engine, which,\nfortunately, was housed only ten rods away, was on the ground.  Though\nit was impossible to save the store, the fire might be prevented from\nspreading.  A band of earnest workers aided Crawford in saving his\nstock.  A large part, of course, must be sacrificed; but, perhaps, a\nquarter was saved.",
        "All at once a terrified whisper spread from one to another:",
        "“Mrs. Morton’s children!  Where are they?  They must be in the third\nstory.”",
        "A poor woman, Mrs. Morton, had been allowed, with her two children, to\nenjoy, temporarily, two rooms in the third story.  She had gone to a\nfarmer’s two miles away to do some work, and her children, seven and\nnine years of age, had remained at home.  They seemed doomed to\ncertain death.",
        "But, even as the inquiry went from lip to lip, the children appeared.\nThey had clambered out of a third story window upon the sloping roof\nof the rear ell, and, pale and dismayed, stood in sight of the shocked\nand terrified crowd, shrieking for help!",
        "“A ladder!  A ladder!” exclaimed half a dozen.",
        "But there was no ladder at hand–none nearer than Mr. Parmenter’s,\nfive minutes’ walk away.  While a messenger was getting it the fate of\nthe children would be decided.",
        "“Tell ’em to jump!” exclaimed Silas Carver.",
        "“They’d break their necks, you fool!” returned his wife.",
        "“Better do that than be burned up!” said the old man.",
        "No one knew what to do–no one but Ben Barclay.",
        "He seized a coil of rope, and with a speed which surprised even\nhimself, climbed up a tall oak tree, whose branches overshadowed the\nroof of the ell part.  In less than a minute he found himself on a\nlimb just over the children.  To the end of the rope was fastened a\nstrong iron hook.",
        "Undismayed by his own danger, Ben threw his rope, though he nearly\nlost his footing while he was doing it, and with an aim so precise\nthat the hook caught in the smaller girl’s dress.",
        "“Hold on to the rope, Jennie, if you can!” he shouted.",
        "The girl obeyed him instinctively.",
        "Drawing the cord hand over hand, the little girl swung clear, and was\nlowered into the arms of Ebenezer Strong, who detached the hook.",
        "“Save the other, Ben!” shouted a dozen.",
        "Ben needed no spur to further effort.",
        "Again he threw the hook, and this time the older girl, comprehending\nwhat was required, caught the rope and swung off the roof, scarcely in\ntime, for her clothing had caught fire.  But when she reached the\nground ready hands extinguished it and the crowd of anxious spectators\nbreathed more freely, as Ben, throwing down the rope, rapidly\ndescended the tree and stood once more in safety, having saved two\nlives.",
        "Just then it was that the poor mother, almost frantic with fear,\narrived on the ground.",
        "“Where are my darlings?  Who will save them?” she exclaimed, full of\nanguish, yet not comprehending that they were out of peril.",
        "“They are safe, and here is the brave boy who saved their lives,” said\nEbenezer Strong.",
        "“God bless you, Ben Barclay!” exclaimed the poor mother.  “You have\nsaved my life as well as theirs, for I should have died if they had\nburned.”",
        "Ben scarcely heard her, for one and another came up to shake his hand\nand congratulate him upon his brave deed.  Our young hero was\ngenerally self-possessed, but he hardly knew how to act when he found\nhimself an object of popular ovation.",
        "“Somebody else would have done it if I hadn’t,” he said modestly.",
        "“You are the only one who had his wits about him,” said Seth Jones.\n“No one thought of the rope till you climbed the tree.  We were all\nlooking for a ladder and there was none to be had nearer than Mr.\nParmenter’s.”",
        "“I wouldn’t have thought of it myself if I hadn’t read in a daily\npaper of something like it,” said Ben.",
        "“Ben,” said Mr. Crawford, “I’d give a thousand dollars to have done\nwhat you did.  You have shown yourself a hero.”",
        "“Oh, Ben, how frightened I was when I saw you on the branch just over\nthe burning building,” said a well-known voice.",
        "Turning, Ben saw it was his mother who spoke.",
        "“Well, it’s all right now, mother,” he said, smiling.  “You are not\nsorry I did it?”",
        "“Sorry!  I am proud of you.”",
        "“I am not proud of my hands,” said Ben.  “Look at them.”",
        "They were chafed and bleeding, having been lacerated by his rapid\ndescent from the tree.",
        "“Come home, Ben, and let me put some salve on them.  How they must\npain you!”",
        "“Wait till the fire is all over, mother.”",
        "The gallant firemen did all they could, but the store was doomed.\nThey could only prevent it from extending.  In half an hour the engine\nwas taken back, and Ben went home with his mother.",
        "“It’s been rather an exciting evening, mother,” said Ben.  “I rather\nthink I shall have to find a new place.”",
