        "“Now lay ye off the helmets,\" / the words from Hagen fell:\n“I with a boon companion / will be your sentinel.\nAnd seek the men of Etzel / to work us further harm,\nFor my royal masters / full quickly will I cry alarm.”",
        "2082",
        "Then freed his head of armor / many a warrior good.\nThey sate them on the corses, / that round them in the blood\nOf wounds themselves had dealt them, / prostrate weltering lay.\nNow to his guests so lofty / scant courtesy did Etzel pay.",
        "2083",
        "Ere yet was come the even, / King Etzel did persuade,\nAnd eke the Lady Kriemhild, / that once more essayed\nThe Hunnish knights to storm them. / Before them might ye see\nGood twenty thousand warriors, / who soon for fight must ready be.",
        "2084",
        "Then with a furious onset / the strangers they attacked.\nDankwart, Hagen’s brother, / who naught of courage lacked,\nSprang out ’mid the besiegers / to ward them from the door.\n’Twas deemed a deadly peril, / yet scatheless stood he there before.",
        "2085",
        "Fierce the struggle lasted / till darkness brought an end.\nThemselves like goodly heroes / the strangers did defend\nAgainst the men of Etzel / all the long summer day.\nWhat host of valiant warriors / before them fell to death a prey!",
        "2086",
        "At turn of sun in summer / that havoc sore was wrought,\nWhen the Lady Kriemhild / revenge so dire sought\nUpon her nearest kinsmen / and many a knight beside,\nWherefore with royal Etzel / never more might joy abide.",
        "2087",
        "As day at last was ending / sad they were of heart.\nThey deemed from life ’twere better / in sudden death to part\nThan be thus long tormented / by great o’erhanging dread.\nThat respite now be granted, / the knights so proud and gallant prayed.",
        "2088",
        "They prayed to lead the monarch / hither to them there.\nAs heroes blood-bespotted, / and stained from battle-gear,\nForth from the hall emerged / the lofty monarchs three.\nThey wist not to whom complained / might their full grievous sorrows be.",
        "2089",
        "Etzel and Kriemhild / they soon before them found,\nAnd great was now their company / from all their lands around.\nSpake Etzel to the strangers: / “What will ye now of me?\nYe hope for end of conflict, / but hardly may such favor be.",
        "2090",
        "“This so mighty ruin / that ye on me have wrought,\nIf death thwart not my purpose, / shall profit you in naught.\nFor child that here ye slew me / and kinsmen dear to me,\nShall peace and reconcilement / from you withheld forever be.”",
        "2091",
        "Thereto gave answer Gunther: / “To that drove sorest need.\nLay all my train of squires / before thy warriors dead\nWhere they for night assembled. / How bore I so great blame?\nOf friendly mind I deemed thee, / as trusting in thy faith I came.”",
        "2092",
        "Then spake eke of Burgundy / the youthful Giselher:\n“Ye knights that still are living / of Etzel, now declare\nWhereof ye may reproach me! / How hath you harmed my hand?\nFor in right friendly manner / came I riding to this land.”",
        "2093",
        "Cried they: “Well is thy friendship / in burgh and country known\nBy sorrow of thy making. / Gladly had we foregone\nThe pleasure of thy coming / from Worms across the Rhine.\nOur country hast thou orphaned, / thou and brother eke of thine.”",
        "2094",
        "In angry mood King Gunther / unto them replied:\n“An ye this mighty hatred / appeased would lay aside,\nBorne ’gainst us knights here homeless, / to both a gain it were\nFor Etzel’s wrath against us / we in sooth no guilt do bear.”",
        "2095",
        "The host then to the strangers: / “Your sorrow here and mine\nAre things all unequal. / For now must I repine\nWith honor all bespotted / and ’neath distress of woe.\nOf you shall never any / hence from my country living go.”",
        "2096",
        "Then did the doughty Gernot / unto King Etzel say:\n“God then in mercy move thee / to act in friendly way.\nSlay us knights here homeless, / yet grant us down to go\nTo meet thee in the open: / thine honor biddeth thus to do.",
        "2097",
        "“Whate’er shall be our portion, / let that straightway appear.\nMen hast thou yet so many / that, should they banish fear,\nNot one of us storm-weary / might keep his life secure.\nHow long shall we here friendless / this woeful travail yet endure?”",
        "2098",
        "By the warriors of Etzel / their wish nigh granted was,\nAnd leave well nigh was given / that from the hall they pass.\nWhen Kriemhild knew their purpose, / high her anger swelled,\nAnd straightway such a respite / was from the stranger knights withheld.",
        "2099",
        "“But nay, ye Hunnish warriors! / what ye have mind to do,\nTherefrom now desist ye, / –such is my counsel true;\nNor let foes so vengeful / pass without the hall,\nElse must in death before them / full many of your kinsmen fall.",
        "2100",
        "“If of them lived none other / but Ute’s sons alone,\nMy three noble brothers, / and they the air had won\nWhere breeze might cool their armor, / to death ye were a prey.\nIn all this world were never / born more valiant thanes than they.”",
        "2101",
        "Then spake the youthful Giselher: / “Full beauteous sister mine,\nWhen to this land thou bad’st me / from far beside the Rhine,\nI little deemed such trouble / did here upon me wait.\nWhereby have I deserved / from the Huns such mortal hate?",
        "2102",
        "“To thee I ever faithful / was, nor wronged thee e’er.\nIn such faith confiding / did I hither fare,\nThat thou to me wert gracious, / O noble sister mine.\nShow mercy now unto us, / we must to thee our lives resign.”",
        "2103",
        "“No mercy may I show you, / –unmerciful I’ll be.\nBy Hagen, knight of Tronje, / was wrought such woe to me,\nThat ne’er is reconcilement / the while that I have life.\nThat must ye all atone for,\" / –quoth the royal Etzel’s wife.",
        "2104",
        "“Will ye but Hagen only / to me as hostage give,\nThen will I not deny you / to let you longer live.\nBorn are ye of one mother / and brothers unto me,\nSo wish I that compounded / here with these warriors peace may be.”",
        "2105",
        "“God in heaven forfend it,\" / Gernot straightway said;\n“E’en though we were a thousand, / lay we all rather dead,\nWe who are thy kinsmen, / ere that warrior one\nHere we gave for hostage. / Never may such thing be done.”",
        "2106",
        "“Die must we all,” quoth Giselher, / “for such is mortal’s end.\nTill then despite of any, / our knighthood we’ll defend.\nWould any test our mettle, / here may he trial make.\nFor ne’er, when help he needed, / did I a faithful friend forsake.”",
        "2107",
        "Then spake the valiant Dankwart, / a knight that knew no fear;\n“In sooth stands not unaided / my brother Hagen here.\nWho here have peace denied us / may yet have cause to rue.\nI would that this ye doubt not, / for verily I tell you true.”",
        "2108",
        "The queen to those around her: / “Ye gallant warriors, go\nNow nigher to the stairway / and straight avenge my woe.\nI’ll ever make requital / therefor, as well I may.\nFor his haughty humor / will I Hagen full repay.",
        "2109",
        "“To pass without the portal / let not one at all,\nFor at its four corners / I’ll bid ignite the hall.\nSo will I fullest vengeance / take for all my woe.\"\nStraightway the thanes of Etzel / ready stood her hest to do.",
        "2110",
        "Who still without were standing / were driven soon within\nBy sword and spear upon them, / that made a mighty din.\nYet naught might those good warriors / from their masters take,\nBy their faith would never / each the other’s side forsake.",
        "2111",
        "To burn the hall commanded / Etzel’s wife in ire,\nAnd tortured they those warriors / there with flaming fire;\nFull soon with wind upon it / the house in flames was seen.\nTo any folk did never / sadder plight befall, I ween.",
        "2112",
        "Their cries within resounded: / “Alack for sorest need!\nHow mickle rather lay we / in storm of battle dead.\n’Fore God ’tis cause for pity, / for here we all must die!\nNow doth the queen upon us / vengeance wreak full grievously.”",
        "2113",
        "Among them spake another: / “Our lives we here must end.\nWhat now avails the greeting / the king to us did send?\nSo sore this heat oppresseth / and parched with thirst my tongue,\nMy life from very anguish / I ween I must resign ere long.”",
        "2114",
        "Then quoth of Tronje Hagen: / “Ye noble knights and good,\nWhoe’er by thirst is troubled, / here let him drink the blood.\nThan wine more potent is it / where such high heat doth rage,\nNor may we at this season / find us a better beverage.”",
        "2115",
        "Where fallen knight was lying, / thither a warrior went.\nAside he laid his helmet, / to gaping wound he bent,\nAnd soon was seen a-quaffing / therefrom the flowing blood.\nTo him though all unwonted, / yet seemed he there such drinking good.",
        "2116",
        "“Now God reward thee, Hagen,\" / the weary warrior said,\n“That I so well have drunken, / thus by thy teaching led.\nBetter wine full seldom / hath been poured for me,\nAnd live I yet a season / I’ll ever faithful prove to thee.”",
        "2117",
        "When there did hear the others / how to him it seemed good,\nMany more beheld ye / eke that drank the blood.\nEach thereby new vigor / for his body won,\nAnd eke for lover fallen / wept many a buxom dame anon.",
        "2118",
        "The flaming brands fell thickly / upon them in the hall,\nWith upraised shields they kept them / yet scatheless from their fall,\nThough smoke and heat together / wrought them anguish sore.\nBeset were heroes never, / I ween, by so great woe before.",
        "2119",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Stand nigh unto the wall,\nLet not the brands all flaming / upon your helmets fall.\nInto the blood beneath you / tread them with your feet.\nIn sooth in evil fashion / us doth our royal hostess greet.”",
        "2120",
        "In trials thus endured / ebbed the night away.\nStill without the portal / did the keen Fiddler stay\nAnd Hagen his good fellow, / o’er shield their bodies leant;\nThey deemed the men of Etzel / still on further mischief bent.",
        "2121",
        "Then was heard the Fiddler: / “Pass we into the hall,\nFor so the Huns shall fondly / deem we are perished all\nAmid the mickle torture / we suffer at their hand.\nNatheless shall they behold us / boun for fight before them stand.”",
        "2122",
        "Spake then of Burgundy / the young Sir Giselher:\n“I ween ’twill soon be dawning, / for blows a cooler air.\nTo live in fuller joyance / now grant us God in heaven.\nTo us dire entertainment / my sister Kriemhild here hath given.”",
        "2123",
        "Spake again another: / “Lo! how I feel the day.\nFor that no better fortune / here await us may,\nSo don, ye knights, your armor, / and guard ye well your life.\nFull soon, in sooth, we suffer / again at hands of Etzel’s wife.”",
        "2124",
        "Fondly Etzel fancied / the strangers all were dead,\nFrom sore stress of battle / and from the fire dread;\nYet within were living / six hundred men so brave,\nThat never thanes more worthy / a monarch for liegemen might have.",
        "2125",
        "The watchers set to watch them / soon full well had seen\nHow still lived the strangers, / spite what wrought had been\nOf harm and grievous evil, / on the monarchs and their band.\nWithin the hall they saw them / still unscathed and dauntless stand.",
        "2126",
        "Told ’twas then to Kriemhild / how they from harm were free.\nWhereat the royal lady / quoth, such thing ne’er might be\nThat any still were living / from that fire dread.\n“Nay, believe I rather / that within they all lie dead.”",
        "2127",
        "Gladly yet the strangers / would a truce compound,\nMight any grace to offer / amid their foes be found.\nBut such appeared not any / in them of Hunnish land.\nWell to avenge their dying / prepared they then with willing hand.",
        "2128",
        "About the dawn of morning / greeted they were again\nWith a vicious onslaught, / that paid full many a thane.\nThere was flung upon them / many a mighty spear,\nWhile gallantly did guard them / the lofty thanes that knew not fear.",
        "2129",
        "The warriors of Etzel / were all of eager mood,\nAnd Kriemhild’s promised bounty / win for himself each would;\nTo do the king’s high bidding / did likewise urge their mind.\n’Twas cause full soon that many / were doomed swift death in fight to\n      find.",
        "2130",
        "Of store of bounty promised / might wonders great be told,\nShe bade on shields to carry / forth the ruddy gold,\nAnd gave to him that wished it / or would but take her store;\nIn sooth a greater hire / ne’er tempted ’gainst the foe before.",
        "2131",
        "A mickle host of warriors / went forth in battle-gear.\nThen quoth the valiant Volker: / “Still may ye find us here.\nNe’er saw I move to battle / warriors more fain,\nThat to work us evil / the bounty of the king have ta’en.”",
        "2132",
        "Then cried among them many: / “Hither, ye knights, more nigh!\nSince all at last must perish, / ’twere better instantly;\nAnd here no warrior falleth / but who fore-doomed hath been.\"\nWith well-flung spears all bristling / full quickly then their shields\n      were seen.",
        "2133",
        "What need of further story? / Twelve hundred stalwart men,\nRepulsed in onset gory, / still returned again;\nBut dealing wounds around them / the strangers cooled their mood,\nAnd there stood all unvanquished. / Flowing might ye see the blood",
        "2134",
        "From deep wounds and mortal, / whereof were many slain.\nFor friends in battle fallen / heard ye loud complain;\nSlain were all those warriors / that served the mighty king,\nWhereat from loving kinsmen / arose a mickle sorrowing.",
