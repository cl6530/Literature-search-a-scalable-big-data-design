        "\n\n",
        "The road was now clear, and even the most timid of counsellors could\nnot longer hold back the most indolent of kings. Jeanne had kept her\nword once more and fulfilled her own prophecy, and a force of\nenthusiasm and certainty, not to be put down, pressed forward the\nunwilling Court towards the great ceremonial of the coronation, to\nwhich all except those most chiefly concerned attached so great an\nimportance. Charles would have hesitated still, and questioned the\npossibility of resistance on the part of Rheims, if that city had not\nsent a deputation of citizens with the keys of the town, to meet him.\nAfter this it was but a triumphal march into the sacred place, where\nthe great cathedral dominated a swarming, busy, mediæval city. King\nand Archbishop had a double triumph, for the priest like the monarch\nhad been shut out from his lawful throne, and it was only in the train\nof the Maid that this great ecclesiastic was able to take possession\nof his dignities. The King alighted with the Archbishop at the\nArchevêché which is close to the cathedral, an immense, old palace in\nwhich the heads of the expedition were lodged. There is a magnificent\nold hall still remaining in which no doubt they all assembled,\nscarcely able to believe that their object was accomplished and that\nthe King of France was actually in Rheims, and all the prophecies\nfulfilled. The Archbishop marched into the city in the morning;\nCharles and his Court, and all his great seigneurs, and the body of\nhis army, in which there were many fighting men half armed, and some\nin their rustic clothes as they had left their fields to join the King\nin his march–poured in in the evening, after the ecclesiastical\nprocession, filling the town with commotion. Jeanne rode beside the\nKing, her banner in her hand. It was July, the vigil of the Madeleine,\nand every church poured forth its crowd to witness the entry, and the\npopulace, half troubled, half glad, gazed its eyes out upon the white\nwarrior at the side of the King. Her father and uncle were there to\nmeet her at the old inn in the Place, which still proudly preserves\nthe record of the peasant guests: two astonished rustics, no doubt,\nwere thrust forth from some window to watch that incredible sight–\nJacques who would rather have drowned his daughter with his own hands,\nthan have seen her thus launched among men, gazing still aghast at the\nresplendent figure of the chevalière at the head of the procession.\nThis was very different from what he had thought of when his village\nrespectability was tortured by the idea of his girl among the\ntroopers, yet probably the rigid peasant had never changed his mind.",
        "We are told by M. Blaze de Bury of an ancient custom which we do not\nfind stated elsewhere. A platform was erected, he tells us, outside\nthe choir of the cathedral to which the King was led the evening\nbefore the coronation, surrounded by his peers, who showed him to the\nassembled people with a traditional proclamation: “Here is your King\nwhom we, peers of France, crown as King and sovereign lord. And if\nthere is a soul here which has any objection to make, let him speak\nand we will answer him. And to-morrow he shall be consecrated by the\ngrace of the Holy Spirit if you have nothing to say against it.” The\npeople replied by cries of “Noël, Noël!” It is not to be supposed that\nthe veto of the people of Rheims would have been effectual had they\nopposed: but the scene is wonderfully picturesque. No doubt Jeanne too\nwas there, watching over her King, as she seems to have done, like a\nmother over her child, at this crisis of his affairs.",
        "That night there was little sleep in Rheims, for everything had to be\nprepared in haste, the decorations of the cathedral, the provisions\nfor the ceremonial. Many of the necessary articles were at Saint Denis\nin the hands of the English, and the treasury of the cathedral had to\nbe ransacked to find the fitting vessels. Fortunately it was rich,\nmore rich probably than it is now, when the commonplace silver of the\nbeginning of this century has replaced the ancient vials. Through the\nshort summer night everyone was at work in these preparations; and by\nthe dawn of day visitors began to flow into the city, great personages\nand small, to attend the great ceremonial and to pay their homage. The\ngreatest of all was the Duke of Lorraine, he who had consulted Jeanne\nabout his health, husband of the heiress of that rich principality,\nand son of Queen Yolande who was no doubt with the Court. All France\nseemed to pour into the famous town, where so important an act was\nabout to be accomplished, with money and wine flowing on all hands,\nand the enthusiasm growing along with the popular excitement and\nprofit. Even great London is stirred to its limits, many miles off\nfrom the centre of proceedings, by such a great event; how much more\nthe little mediæval city, in which every one might hope to see\nsomething of the pageant, as one shining group after another, with\narmour blazing in the sun, and sleek horses caracoling, arrived at the\ngreat gates of the Archevêché: and lesser parties scarcely less\ninteresting poured in in need of lodging, of equipment and provisions;\nwhile every housewife searched her stores for a piece of brilliant\nstuff, of old silk or embroidery, to make her house shine like the\nrest.",
        "Early in the morning, a wonderful procession came out of the\nArchbishop’s house. Four splendid peers of France, in full armour with\ntheir banners, rode through the streets to the old Abbey of Saint Remy\n–the old church which Leo IX. consecrated, in the eleventh century,\non an equally splendid occasion, and which may still be seen to-day–\nto fetch from its shrine, where it was strictly guarded by the monks,\nthe Sainte Ampoule, the holy and sacred vial in which the oil of\nconsecration had been sent to Clovis out of Heaven. These noble\nmessengers were the “hostages” of this sacred charge, engaging\nthemselves by an oath never to lose sight of it by night or day, till\nit was restored to its appointed guardians. This vow having been made,\nthe Abbot of St. Remy, in his richest robes, appeared surrounded by\nhis monks, carrying the treasure in his hands; and under a splendid\ncanopy, blazing in the sunshine with cloth of gold, marched towards\nthe cathedral under the escort of the Knights Hostages, blazing also\nin the flashes of their armour. This procession was met half-way,\nbefore the Church of St. Denis, by another, that of the Archbishop and\nhis train, to whom the holy oil was solemnly confided, and carried by\nthem to the cathedral, already filled by a dazzled and dazzling crowd.",
        "The Maid had her occupations this July morning like the rest. We hear\nnothing of any interview with her father, or with Durand the good\nuncle who had helped her in the beginning of her career; though it was\nDurand who was sent for to the King and questioned as to Jeanne’s life\nin her childhood and early youth; which we may take as proof that\nJacques d’Arc still stood aloof, dour, as a Scotch peasant father\nmight have been, suspicious of his daughter’s intimacy with all these\nfine people, and in no way cured of his objections to the publicity\nwhich is little less than shame to such rugged folk. And there were\nhis two sons who would take him about, and with whom probably in their\neasier commonplace he was more at home than with Jeanne. What the Maid\nhad to do on the morning of the coronation day was something very\ndifferent from any home talk with her relations. She who felt herself\ncommissioned not only to lead the armies of France, but to deal with\nher princes and take part in her councils, occupied the morning in\ndictating a letter to the Duke of Burgundy. She had summoned the\nEnglish by letter three times repeated, to withdraw peaceably from the\npossessions which by God’s will were French. It was with still better\nreason that she summoned Philip of Burgundy to renounce his feud with\nhis cousin, and thus to heal the breach which had torn France in two:",
        "  JHESUS, MARIA.",
        "  High and redoubtable Prince, Duke of Burgundy. Jeanne the Maid\n  requires on the part of the King of Heaven, my most just sovereign\n  and Lord (/mon droicturier souverain seigneur), that the King of\n  France and you make peace between yourselves, firm, strong and\n  that will endure. Pardon each other of good heart, entirely, as\n  loyal Christians ought to do, and if you desire to fight let it be\n  against the Saracens. Prince of Burgundy, I pray, supplicate, and\n  require, as humbly as may be, fight no longer against the holy\n  kingdom of France: withdraw, at once and speedily, your people who\n  are in any strongholds or fortresses of the said holy kingdom; and\n  on the part of the gentle King of France, he is ready to make\n  peace with you, having respect to his honour, and upon your life\n  that you never will gain a battle against loyal Frenchmen and that\n  all those who war against the said holy kingdom of France, war\n  against the King Jesus, King of Heaven and of all the world and my\n  just and sovereign Lord. And I pray and require with clasped hands\n  that you fight not, nor make any battle against us, neither your\n  friends nor your subjects; but believe always however great in\n  number may be the men you lead against us, that you will never\n  win, and it would be great pity for the great battle and the blood\n  that would be shed of those who came against us. Three weeks ago I\n  sent you a letter by a herald that you should be present at the\n  consecration of the King, which to-day, Sunday, the seventeenth of\n  the present month of July, is done in the city of Rheims: to which\n  I have had no answer, nor even any news by the said herald. To God\n  I commend you, and may He be your guard if it pleases Him, and I\n  pray God to make good peace.",
        "  Written at the aforesaid Rheims, the seventeenth day of July,\n  1429.",
        "When the letter was finished Jeanne put on her armour and prepared for\nthe great ceremony. We are not told what part she took in it, nor is\nany more prominent position assigned to her than among the noble crowd\nof peers and generals who surrounded the altar, where her place would\nnaturally be, upon the broad raised platform of the choir, so\nexcellently adapted for such ceremonies. Her banner we are told was\nborne into the cathedral, in order, as she proudly explained\nafterwards, that having been foremost in the danger it should share\nthe honour.",
        "But we have no right to suppose that the Maid took the position of the\nchief actor in the pageant and stood alone by the side of Charles, as\nthe exigencies of the pictorial art have required her to do. When,\nhowever, the ceremony was completed, and he had received on his knees\nthe anointing which separated him as king from every other class of\nmen, and while the lofty vaults echoed with the cries of Noël! Noël!\nby which the people hailed the completed ceremony, Jeanne could\ncontain herself no longer. The object was attained for which she had\nlaboured and struggled, and overcome every opponent. She stepped\nforward out of the brilliant crowd, and threw herself at the feet of\nthe now crowned monarch, embracing his knees. “Gentle King,” she cried\nwith tears, “now is the pleasure of God fulfilled–whose will it was\nthat I should raise the siege of Orleans and lead you to this city of\nRheims to receive your consecration. Now has He shown that you are\ntrue King, and that the kingdom of France truly belongs to you alone.”",
        "Those broken words, her tears, the cry of that profound satisfaction\nwhich is almost anguish, the “Lord, now lettest thou thy servant\ndepart in peace,” which is so suitable to the lips of the old, so\npoignant from those of the young, pierced all hearts. It is added that\nshe asked leave to withdraw, her work being done, and that all who saw\nher were filled with sympathy. It was no doubt the irresistible\noutburst of a heart too full; and though that fulness was all joy and\ntriumph, yet there was in it a sense of completed work, a rending\nasunder and tearing away from life, the end of a wonderful and\ntriumphant tale.",
        "There is a considerable controversy as to the precise meaning of that\noutburst of emotion. Did the Maid mean that her work was over, and her\ndivine mission fulfilled? Was this all that she believed herself to be\nappointed to do? or did she expect, as she sometimes said, to bouter\nthe English out of France altogether? In the one case she ought to\nhave relinquished her work, and in not doing so she acted without the\nprotection of God which had hitherto made her invulnerable. In the\nother, her “voices,” her inspiration, must have failed her, for her\ncourse of triumph went no farther. It is impossible to decide between\nthese contending theories. She did speak in both senses, sometimes\ndeclaring that she was to take Paris, sometimes, her intention to\nbouter the English out of the kingdom. At the same time she betrayed\na constant conviction that her office had limitations and must come to\nan end. “I will last but a year,” she said to the King and to Alençon.\nThe testimony of Dunois seems to be the best we can have on this\npoint. He says in his deposition, made many years after her death:\n“Although Jeanne sometimes talked playfully to amuse people, of things\nconcerning the war which were not afterwards accomplished, yet when\nshe spoke seriously of the war, and of her own career and her\nvocation, she never affirmed anything but that she was sent to raise\nthe siege of Orleans and to lead the King to Rheims to be crowned.”",
        "If this were so was she wrong in continuing her warfare, and did she\nplace herself in the position of one who goes on her own charges,\nfinding the mission from on high unnecessary? Or in the other case did\nher inspiration fail her, or were the intrigues of Charles and his\nCourt sufficient to balk the designs of Heaven? We prefer to think\nthat Jeanne’s commission concerned only those two things which she\naccomplished so completely; but that in continuing the war, she acted\nonly as a well inspired and honourable young soldier might, though no\nlonger as the direct messenger of God. She had as much right to do so\nas to return to her distaff or her needle in her native village; but\nshe became subject to all the ordinary laws of war by so doing,\nexposed herself to be taken or overthrown like any man-at-arms, and\naccepted that risk. What is certain is, that every intrigue sprang up\nagain afresh on the evening of that brilliant and triumphant\nceremonial, and that from the moment of the accomplishment of her\ngreat work the failure of the Maid began.",
        "These intrigues had been in her way since her very first beginning, as\nhas been seen. At Orleans, in the very field as well as in the council\nchamber and the presence, everything was done to balk her, and to\ncross her plans, but in vain; she triumphed over every contrivance\nagainst her, and broke through the plots, and overcame the plotters.\nBut after Rheims the combination of dangers became ever greater and\ngreater, and we may say that no merely human general would have had a\nchance in face of the many and bewildering influences of evil. Charles\nwho was himself, at least at this period of his career, sufficiently\nindolent and unenterprising to have damped the energies of any\ncommander, was, in addition, surrounded by advisers who had always\nbeen impatient and jealous of the interference of Jeanne, and would\nhave cast her off as a witch, or passed her by as an impostor, had\nthat been possible, without permitting her to strike a blow. They had\nnow grudgingly made use of her, or rather, for this is too much to\nsay, had permitted her action where they had no power to restrain it:\nbut they were as little friendly, as malignant in their treatment of\nthe Maid as ever, and more hopeful, now that so much had been done by\nher means, of being able to shake her off and pursue their fate in\ntheir own way.",
        "The position of Charles crowned King of France with all the\ntraditional pomp, master of the Orleannais, with fresh bands of\nsupporters coming in to swell his army day by day, and Paris itself\nalmost within his reach, was very different from that of the\ndiscredited Dauphin at Chinon, whom half the world believed to have no\nright to the crown which his own mother had signed away from him, and\nwho wasted his idle days in folly to the profit of the greedy\ncouncillors who schemed and trafficked with his enemies, and to the\ndestruction of all his hopes. The strange apparition of virginal\npurity, energy, and faith which had taken up and saved him against his\nwill and all his efforts had not ceased for a moment to be hateful to\nLa Tremouille and his party; and Charles–though he seems to have had\na certain appreciation of the Maid, and even a liking for her frank\nand fearless character, apart from any faith in her mission–was far\ntoo ready to accept the facts of the moment, and probably to believe\nthat, after all, his own worth and favour with Heaven had a great deal\nto do with this dazzling triumph and success: certainly he was not the\nman to make any stand for his deliverer. But that she was an auxiliary\ntoo important to be sent away was reluctantly apparent to them all. To\nkeep her as a sort of tame angel about the Court in order to be\nproduced when she was wanted, to put heart into the soldiers and\nfrighten the English as she certainly had the gift of doing, no doubt\nappeared to all as a thing desirable enough. And they dared not let\nher go “because of the people,” nor, may we believe, would Alençon,\nDunois, La Hire, and the rest have tolerated thus the abandonment of\ntheir comrade. To dismiss her even at her own word would have been\nimpossible, and it is hard to believe that Jeanne, after that\nextraordinary brief career as a triumphant general and leader, could\nhave gone back to her father’s cottage of the village, though she\nthought she would fain have done so. If we are to believe that she\nfelt her mission to be fulfilled, she was yet mistress of her fate to\nserve France and the King as seemed best.",
        "And we have no evidence that her “voices” forsook her, or discouraged\nher. They seem to have changed a little in their burden, they began to\nmingle a sadder tone in their intimations. It began to be breathed\ninto her mind though not immediately, that something was to happen to\nher, some disaster not explained, yet that God was to be with her. It\nseems to me that all the circumstances are compatible with a change in\nJeanne’s consciousness, from the moment of the coronation. It might\nhave been a grander thing had she retired there and then, her work\nbeing accomplished as she declared it to be; but it would not have\nbeen human. She was still a power, if no longer the direct messenger\nfrom Heaven; a general, with much skill and natural aptitude if not\nthe Sent of God; and the ardour of a military career had got into her\nveins. No doubt she was much more good for that, now, than for sitting\nby the side of Isabeau d’Arc at Domremy, and working even into a piece\nof embroidery for the altar, her remembrances and visions of camp and\nsiege and the intoxication of victory. She remained, conscious that\nshe was no longer exactly as of old, to fight not only against the\nEnglish, but with intimate enemies, far more bitter, whom now she\nknew, against the ordinary fortune of war, and against that which is a\nthousand times worse, the hatred and envy, the cruel carelessness, and\nthe malignant schemes of her own countrymen for whom she had fought.",
        "This, so far as we can judge, appears to be the position of Jeanne in\nthe second portion of her career; perhaps only dimly apprehended and\nat moments, by herself; not much thought of probably by those around\nher, the wisest of whom had always been sceptical of her divine\ncommission; while the populace never saw any change in her, and\nbelieved that at one time as well as at another the Maid was the Maid,\nand had victory at her command. And no doubt that influence would have\nendured for some time at least, and her dauntless rush against every\nobstacle would have carried success with it, had she been able to\ncarry out her plans, and fly forth upon Paris as she had done upon\nOrleans, carrying on the campaign swiftly, promptly, without pause or\nuncertainty. Bedford himself said that Paris “would fall at a blow,\"\nif she came on. It had been hard enough, however, to do that, as we\nhave seen, when she was the only hope of France and had the fire of\nthe divine enthusiasm in her veins; but it was still more hard now to\nmould a young King elated with triumph, beginning to feel the crown\nsafe upon his head, and to feel that if there was still much to gain,\nthere was now a great deal to be lost. The position was complicated\nand made more difficult for Jeanne by every advantage she had gained.",
        "In the meantime the secret negotiations, which were always being\ncarried on under the surface, had come to this point, that Charles had\nmade a private treaty with Philip of Burgundy by which that prince\npledged himself to give up Paris into the King’s hands within fifteen\ndays. This agreement furnished a sufficient pretext for the delay in\nmarching against Paris, delay which was Charles’s invariable method,\nand which but for Jeanne’s hardihood and determination, had all but\ncrushed the expedition to Rheims itself. It was never with any will of\nhis or of his adviser, La Tremouille, that any stronghold was\nassailed. He would fain have passed by Troyes, as the reader will\nremember, he would fain have delayed going to Rheims; in each case he\nhad been forced to move by the impetuosity of the Maid. But a treaty\nwhich touched the honour of the King was a different matter. Philip of\nBurgundy, with whom it was made, seems to have held the key of the\nposition. He was called to Paris by Bedford on one side to defend the\ncity against its lawful King; he had pledged himself on the other to\nCharles to give it up. He had in his hands, though it is uncertain\nwhether he ever read it, that missive of the sorceress, the letter of\nJeanne which I have quoted, calling upon him on the part of God to\nmake peace. What was he to do? There were reasons drawing him to both\nsides. He was the enemy of Charles on account of the murder of his\nfather, and therefore had every interest in keeping Paris from him; he\nwas angry with the English on account of the marriage of the Duke of\nGloucester with Jacqueline of Brabant, which interfered with his own\nrights and safety in Flanders, and therefore might have served himself\nby giving up the capital to the King. As for the appeal of Jeanne,\nwhat was the letter of that mad creature to a prince and statesman?\nThe progress of affairs was arrested by this double problem. Jeanne\nhad been the prominent, the only important figure in the history of\nFrance for some months past. Now that shining figure was jostled\naside, and the ordinary laws of life, with all the counter changes of\nnegotiation, the ineffectual comings and goings, the meaner half-seen\npersons, the fierce contending personal interests–in which there was\nno love of either God or man, or any elevated notion of patriotism–\ncame again into play.",
        "Jeanne would seem to have already foreseen and felt this change even\nbefore she left Rheims; there is a new tone of sadness in some of her\nrecorded words; or if not of sadness, at least of consciousness that\nan end was approaching to all these triumphs and splendours. The\nfollowing tale is told in various different versions, as occurring\nwith different people; but the account I give is taken from the lips\nof Dunois himself, a very competent witness. As the King, after his\ncoronation, wended his way through the country, receiving submission\nand joyous welcome from every village and little town, it happened\nthat while passing through the town of La Ferté, Jeanne rode between\nthe Archbishop of Rheims and Dunois. The Archbishop had never been\nfriendly to the Maid, and now it was clear, watched her with that half\nsatirical, half amused look of the wise man, curious and cynical in\npresence of the incomprehensible, observing her ways and very ready to\ncatch her tripping and to entangle her if possible in her own words.\nThe people thronged the way, full of enthusiasm, acclaiming the King\nand shouting their joyful exclamations of “Noël!” though it does not\nappear that any part of their devotion was addressed to Jeanne\nherself. “Oh, the good people,” she cried with tears in her eyes, “how\njoyful they are to see their noble King! And how happy should I be to\nend my days and be buried here among them!” The priest unmoved by such\nan exclamation from so young a mouth attempted instantly, like the\nJewish doctors with our Lord, to catch her in her words and draw from\nher some expression that might be used against her. “Jeanne,” he said,\n“in what place do you expect to die?” It was a direct challenge to the\nmessenger of Heaven to take upon herself the gift of prophecy. But\nJeanne in her simplicity shattered the snare which probably she did\nnot even perceive: “When it pleases God,” she said. “I know neither\nthe place nor the time.”",
        "It was enough, however, that she should think of death and of the\nsweetness of it, after her work accomplished, in the very moment of\nher height of triumph–to show something of a new leaven working in\nher virgin soul.",
        "One characteristic reward, however, Jeanne did receive. Her father and\nuncle were lodged at the public cost as benefactors of the kingdom, as\nmay still be seen by the inscription on the old inn in the great Place\nat Rheims; and when Jacques d’Arc left the city he carried with him a\npatent–better than one of nobility which, however, came to the family\nlater–of exemption for the villages of Domremy and Greux of all taxes\nand tributes; “an exemption maintained and confirmed up to the\nRevolution, in favour of the said Maid, native of that parish, in\nwhich are her relations.” “In the register of the Exchequer,” says M.\nBlaze de Bury, “at the name of the parish of Greux and Domremy, the\nplace for the receipt is blank, with these words as explanation: à\ncause de la Pucelle, on account of the Maid.” There could not have\nbeen a more delightful reward or one more after her own heart. It\nwould be a graceful act of the France of to-day, which has so warmly\nrevived the name and image of her maiden deliverer, to renew so\ntouching a distinction to her native place.",
        "We are told that Jeanne parted with her father and uncle with tears,\nlonging that she might return with them and go back to her mother who\nwould rejoice to see her again. This was no doubt quite true, though\nit might be equally true that she could not have gone back. Did not\nthe father return, a little sullen, grasping the present he had\nhimself received, not sure still that it was not disreputable to have\na daughter who wore coat armour and rode by the side of the King, a\nposition certainly not proper for maidens of humble birth? The dazzled\npeasants turned their backs upon her while she was thus at the height\nof glory, and never, so far as appears, saw her face again.",
