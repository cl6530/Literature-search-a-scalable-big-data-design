        "Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of Comic\nBy Henri Bergson, member of the Institute Professor at the College de France\nAuthorised Translation by Cloudesley Brereton L. es L. (Paris), M.A. (Cantab) and Fred Rothwell b.a. (London)",
        "What does laughter mean? What is the basal element in the laughable?\nWhat common ground can we find between the grimace of a merry-\nandrew, a play upon words, an equivocal situation in a burlesque and\na scene of high comedy? What method of distillation will yield us\ninvariably the same essence from which so many different products\nborrow either their obtrusive odour or their delicate perfume? The\ngreatest of thinkers, from Aristotle downwards, have tackled this\nlittle problem, which has a knack of baffling every effort, of\nslipping away and escaping only to bob up again, a pert challenge\nflung at philosophic speculation. Our excuse for attacking the\nproblem in our turn must lie in the fact that we shall not aim at\nimprisoning the comic spirit within a definition. We regard it,\nabove all, as a living thing. However trivial it may be, we shall\ntreat it with the respect due to life. We shall confine ourselves to\nwatching it grow and expand. Passing by imperceptible gradations\nfrom one form to another, it will be seen to achieve the strangest\nmetamorphoses. We shall disdain nothing we have seen. Maybe we may\ngain from this prolonged contact, for the matter of that, something\nmore flexible than an abstract definition,--a practical, intimate\nacquaintance, such as springs from a long companionship. And maybe\nwe may also find that, unintentionally, we have made an acquaintance\nthat is useful. For the comic spirit has a logic of its own, even in\nits wildest eccentricities. It has a method in its madness. It\ndreams, I admit, but it conjures up, in its dreams, visions that are\nat once accepted and understood by the whole of a social group. Can\nit then fail to throw light for us on the way that human imagination\nworks, and more particularly social, collective, and popular\nimagination? Begotten of real life and akin to art, should it not\nalso have something of its own to tell us about art and life?",
        "At the outset we shall put forward three observations which we look\nupon as fundamental. They have less bearing on the actually comic\nthan on the field within which it must be sought.",
