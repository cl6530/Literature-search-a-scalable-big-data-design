        "Dear Sir.–Your courteous letter of the 1st instant, in which you\ncordially consent to share my wealth and dwell together with me in\nfraternal sunshine, is duly received. While I dislike to appear cold and\ndistant to one who seems so yearnful and so clinging, and while I do not\nwish to be regarded as purse-proud or arrogant, I must decline your kind\noffer to whack up. You had not heard, very likely, that I am not now a\nCommunist. I used to be, I admit, and the society no doubt neglected to\nstrike my name off the roll of active members. For a number of years I was\nquite active as a Communist. I would have been more active, but I had\nconscientious scruples against being active in anything then.",
        "While you may be perfectly sincere in your belief that the great\ncapitalists like Mr. Gould and Mr. Vanderbilt should divide with you, you\nwill have great difficulty in making it perfectly clear to them. They will\nprobably demur and delay, and hem and haw, and procrastinate, till finally\nthey will get out of it in some way. Still, I do not wish to throw cold\nwater on your enterprise. If the other capitalists look favorably on the\nplan, I will cheerfully co-operate with them. You go and see what you can\ndo with Mr. Vanderbilt, and then come to me.",
        "You go on at some length to tell me how the most of the wealth is in the\nhands of a few men, and then you attack those men and refer to them in a\nway that makes my blood run cold. You tell the millionaires of America to\nbeware, for the hot breath of a bloody-handed Nemesis is already in the\nair.",
        "You may say to Nemesis, if you please, that I have a double-barreled\nshotgun standing at the head of my bed every night, and that I am in the\nNemesis business. You also refer to the fact that the sleuth-hounds of\neternal justice are camped on the trail of the pampered millionaire, and\nyou ask us to avaunt. If you see the other sleuth-hounds of your society\nwithin a week or two, I wish you would say to them that at a regular\nmeeting of the millionaires of this country, after the minutes of the\nprevious meeting had been read and approved, we voted almost unanimously\nto discourage any sleuth-hound that we found camped on our trail after ten\no’clock, P.M. Sleuth-hounds who want to ramble over our trails during\noffice hours may do so with the utmost impunity, but after ten o’clock we\nwant to use our trails for other purposes. No man wants to go to the great\nexpense of maintaining a trail winter and summer, and then leave it out\nnights for other people to use and return it when they get ready.",
        "I do not censure you, however. If you could convince every one of the\nutility of Communism, it would certainly be a great boon–to you. To those\nwho are now engaged in feeding themselves with flat beer out of a tomato\ncan, such a change as you suggest would fall like a ray of sunshine in a\nrat-hole, but alas! it may never be. I tried it awhile, but my efforts\nwere futile. The effect of my great struggle seemed to be that men’s\nhearts grew more and more stony, and my pantaloons got thinner and thinner\non the seat, ’till it seemed to me that the world never was so cold. Then\nI made some experiments in manual labor. As I began to work harder and sit\ndown less, I found that the world was not so cold. It was only when I sat\ndown a long time that I felt how cold and rough the world really was.",
        "Perhaps it is so with you. Sedentary habits and stale beer are apt to make\nus morbid. Sitting on the stone door sills of hallways and public\nbuildings during cold weather is apt to give you an erroneous impression\nof life.",
        "Of course I am willing to put my money into a common fund if I can be\nconvinced that it is best. I was an inside passenger on a Leadville coach\nsome years ago, when a few of your friends suggested that we all put our\nmoney into a common fund, and I was almost the first one to see that they\nwere right. They went away into the mountains to apportion the money they\ngot from our party, but I never got any dividend. Probably they lost my\npost-office address.",
