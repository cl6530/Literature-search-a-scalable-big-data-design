        "’The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\n’suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\nbefore the squirrel takes them all away.’ ’With all my heart,’ said\nPartlet, ’let us go and make a holiday of it together.’",
        "So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\nthere till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so\nmany nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and\nwould not, I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that\nit did not become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to\nbuild a little carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished,\nPartlet jumped into it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness\nhimself to it and draw her home. ’That’s a good joke!’ said\nChanticleer; ’no, that will never do; I had rather by half walk home;\nI’ll sit on the box and be coachman, if you like, but I’ll not draw.’\nWhile this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, ’You\nthieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds? I’ll give it\nyou well for your insolence!’ and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer\nmost lustily. But Chanticleer was no coward, and returned the duck’s\nblows with his sharp spurs so fiercely that she soon began to cry out\nfor mercy; which was only granted her upon condition that she would\ndraw the carriage home for them. This she agreed to do; and\nChanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ’Now, duck, get on as\nfast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good pace.",
        "After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a\npin walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ’Stop,\nstop!’ and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way,\nand such dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that\nhe and his friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles\noff, and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he\nbegged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them\na lift in their carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but\nthin fellows, and not likely to take up much room, told them they\nmight ride, but made them promise not to dirty the wheels of the\ncarriage in getting in, nor to tread on Partlet’s toes.",
        "Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in\nthe dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good\ndeal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their\nquarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his\nhouse was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:\nhowever, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet\nhad laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in\nthe habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and\nthey bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.",
        "Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\nstirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the\negg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into\nthe fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast\nasleep, and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s\neasy chair and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this,\nthey crept away as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in\nthe open air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the\nbrook which ran close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.",
        "An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his\nhandkerchief to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked\nhim: then he walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire,\nbut when he stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost\nblinded him. ’Bless me!’ said he, ’all the world seems to have a\ndesign against my head this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself\nsulkily into his easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him;\nand this time the pain was not in his head. He now flew into a very\ngreat passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night\nbefore, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore\nthat he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a\ngreat deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble\nbut their apish tricks.",
        "Another day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together; so\nChanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\nharnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the\ncarriage, and away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and\nsaid, ’Where are you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,",
        " ’All on our way\n  A visit to pay\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’",
        "Then the cat said, ’Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ’With all my\nheart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’",
        " ’Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\n  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!\n  Now, mice, be ready,\n  And, wheels, run steady!\n  For we are going a visit to pay\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’",
        "Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and\nChanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with\nthem.",
        "When they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the\nmice drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet\nflew upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\nthe washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\nmillstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\nup in the towel.",
        "When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\nthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\nwash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face;\nand when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the\ntowel all over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went\nwithout his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow,\nthe pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and,\njumping up, would have run out of the house; but when he came to the\ndoor, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on the spot.",
        "Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the\nmountains to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they\nfound should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very\nlarge nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it\nall to herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it,\nand it stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried\nout to Chanticleer, ’Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some\nwater, or I shall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to\nthe river, and said, ’River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in\nthe mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ’Run\nfirst to the bride, and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the\nwater.’ Chanticleer ran to the bride, and said, ’Bride, you must give\nme a silken cord, for then the river will give me water, and the water\nI will carry to Partlet, who lies on the mountain, and will be choked\nby a great nut.’ But the bride said, ’Run first, and bring me my\ngarland that is hanging on a willow in the garden.’ Then Chanticleer\nran to the garden, and took the garland from the bough where it hung,\nand brought it to the bride; and then the bride gave him the silken\ncord, and he took the silken cord to the river, and the river gave him\nwater, and he carried the water to Partlet; but in the meantime she\nwas choked by the great nut, and lay quite dead, and never moved any\nmore.",
        "Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the\nbeasts came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a\nlittle hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they\nharnessed themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way\nthey met the fox. ’Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he. ’To\nbury my Partlet,’ said the other. ’May I go with you?’ said the fox.\n’Yes; but you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to\ndraw you.’ Then the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the\nbear, the goat, and all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon\nthe hearse.",
        "So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ’How shall we get\nover?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ’I will lay myself across,\nand you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the\nstraw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell\nin and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood\ncame and said, ’I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream,\nand you shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they\nmanaged so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away\nby the stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and\nkindly offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the\nstream; and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse,\nand managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other\nmourners, who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into\nthe water and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.",
        "Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug\na grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over\nher. Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last\nhe died too; and so all were dead.",
