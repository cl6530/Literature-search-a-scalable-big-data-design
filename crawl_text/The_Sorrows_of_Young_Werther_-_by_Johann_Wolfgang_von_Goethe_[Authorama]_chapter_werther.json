        "How happy I am that I am gone! My dear friend, what a thing is\nthe heart of man! To leave you, from whom I have been inseparable,\nwhom I love so dearly, and yet to feel happy! I know you will\nforgive me. Have not other attachments been specially appointed\nby fate to torment a head like mine? Poor Leonora! and yet I was\nnot to blame. Was it my fault, that, whilst the peculiar charms\nof her sister afforded me an agreeable entertainment, a passion\nfor me was engendered in her feeble heart? And yet am I wholly\nblameless? Did I not encourage her emotions? Did I not feel\ncharmed at those truly genuine expressions of nature, which, though\nbut little mirthful in reality, so often amused us? Did I not —\nbut oh! what is man, that he dares so to accuse himself? My dear\nfriend I promise you I will improve; I will no longer, as has ever\nbeen my habit, continue to ruminate on every petty vexation which\nfortune may dispense; I will enjoy the present, and the past shall\nbe for me the past. No doubt you are right, my best of friends,\nthere would be far less suffering amongst mankind, if men — and\nGod knows why they are so fashioned — did not employ their\nimaginations so assiduously in recalling the memory of past sorrow,\ninstead of bearing their present lot with equanimity. Be kind\nenough to inform my mother that I shall attend to her business to\nthe best of my ability, and shall give her the earliest information\nabout it. I have seen my aunt, and find that she is very far from\nbeing the disagreeable person our friends allege her to be. She\nis a lively, cheerful woman, with the best of hearts. I explained\nto her my mother’s wrongs with regard to that part of her portion\nwhich has been withheld from her. She told me the motives and\nreasons of her own conduct, and the terms on which she is willing\nto give up the whole, and to do more than we have asked. In short,\nI cannot write further upon this subject at present; only assure\nmy mother that all will go on well. And I have again observed,\nmy dear friend, in this trifling affair, that misunderstandings\nand neglect occasion more mischief in the world than even malice\nand wickedness. At all events, the two latter are of less frequent\noccurrence.",
        "In other respects I am very well off here. Solitude in this\nterrestrial paradise is a genial balm to my mind, and the young\nspring cheers with its bounteous promises my oftentimes misgiving\nheart. Every tree, every bush, is full of flowers; and one might\nwish himself transformed into a butterfly, to float about in this\nocean of perfume, and find his whole existence in it. ",
        "The town itself is disagreeable; but then, all around, you find an\ninexpressible beauty of nature. This induced the late Count M to\nlay out a garden on one of the sloping hills which here intersect\neach other with the most charming variety, and form the most lovely\nvalleys. The garden is simple; and it is easy to perceive, even\nupon your first entrance, that the plan was not designed by a\nscientific gardener, but by a man who wished to give himself up\nhere to the enjoyment of his own sensitive heart. Many a tear\nhave I already shed to the memory of its departed master in a\nsummer-house which is now reduced to ruins, but was his favourite\nresort, and now is mine. I shall soon be master of the place. \nThe gardener has become attached to me within the last few days,\nand he will lose nothing thereby.",
        "A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like\nthese sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.\nI am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which\nwas created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my\ndear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil\nexistence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of\ndrawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that\nI never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley\nteems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper\nsurface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray\ngleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the\ntall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth,\na thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of\nthe little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless\nindescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence\nof the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of\nthat universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around\nus in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads\nmy eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its\npower, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with\nlonging, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress\nupon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might\nbe the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite\nGod! O my friend — but it is too much for my strength — I sink\nunder the weight of the splendour of these visions!",
        "I know not whether some deceitful spirits haunt this spot, or\nwhether it be the warm, celestial fancy in my own heart which\nmakes everything around me seem like paradise. In front of the\nhouse is a fountain, — a fountain to which I am bound by a charm\nlike Melusina and her sisters. Descending a gentle slope, you come\nto an arch, where, some twenty steps lower down, water of the\nclearest crystal gushes from the marble rock. The narrow wall which\nencloses it above, the tall trees which encircle the spot, and the\ncoolness of the place itself, — everything imparts a pleasant but\nsublime impression. Not a day passes on which I do not spend an\nhour there. The young maidens come from the town to fetch water,\n— innocent and necessary employment, and formerly the occupation of\nthe daughters of kings. As I take my rest there, the idea of the old\npatriarchal life is awakened around me. I see them, our old ancestors,\nhow they formed their friendships and contracted alliances at the\nfountain-side; and I feel how fountains and streams were guarded by\nbeneficent spirits. He who is a stranger to these sensations has\nnever really enjoyed cool repose at the side of a fountain after the\nfatigue of a weary summer day.",
        "You ask if you shall send me books. My dear friend, I beseech you,\nfor the love of God, relieve me from such a yoke! I need no more\nto be guided, agitated, heated. My heart ferments sufficiently of\nitself. I want strains to lull me, and I find them to perfection\nin my Homer. Often do I strive to allay the burning fever of my\nblood; and you have never witnessed anything so unsteady, so\nuncertain, as my heart. But need I confess this to you, my dear\nfriend, who have so often endured the anguish of witnessing my\nsudden transitions from sorrow to immoderate joy, and from sweet\nmelancholy to violent passions? I treat my poor heart like a sick\nchild, and gratify its every fancy. Do not mention this again:\nthere are people who would censure me for it.",
        "The common people of the place know me already, and love me,\nparticularly the children. When at first I associated with them,\nand inquired in a friendly tone about their various trifles, some\nfancied that I wished to ridicule them, and turned from me in\nexceeding ill-humour. I did not allow that circumstance to grieve\nme: I only felt most keenly what I have often before observed.\nPersons who can claim a certain rank keep themselves coldly aloof\nfrom the common people, as though they feared to lose their importance\nby the contact; whilst wanton idlers, and such as are prone to bad\njoking, affect to descend to their level, only to make the poor\npeople feel their impertinence all the more keenly.",
        "I know very well that we are not all equal, nor can be so; but it\nis my opinion that he who avoids the common people, in order not\nto lose their respect, is as much to blame as a coward who hides\nhimself from his enemy because he fears defeat.",
        "The other day I went to the fountain, and found a young servant-girl,\nwho had set her pitcher on the lowest step, and looked around to\nsee if one of her companions was approaching to place it on her\nhead. I ran down, and looked at her. “Shall I help you, pretty\nlass?” said I. She blushed deeply. “Oh, sir!” she exclaimed. \n\"No ceremony!” I replied. She adjusted her head-gear, and I\nhelped her. She thanked me, and ascended the steps.",
        "I have made all sorts of acquaintances, but have as yet found no\nsociety. I know not what attraction I possess for the people, so\nmany of them like me, and attach themselves to me; and then I feel\nsorry when the road we pursue together goes only a short distance.\nIf you inquire what the people are like here, I must answer, “The\nsame as everywhere.” The human race is but a monotonous affair.\nMost of them labour the greater part of their time for mere\nsubsistence; and the scanty portion of freedom which remains to\nthem so troubles them that they use every exertion to get rid of\nit. Oh, the destiny of man!",
        "But they are a right good sort of people. If I occasionally forget\nmyself, and take part in the innocent pleasures which are not yet\nforbidden to the peasantry, and enjoy myself, for instance, with\ngenuine freedom and sincerity, round a well-covered table, or\narrange an excursion or a dance opportunely, and so forth, all\nthis produces a good effect upon my disposition; only I must forget\nthat there lie dormant within me so many other qualities which\nmoulder uselessly, and which I am obliged to keep carefully concealed.\nAh! this thought affects my spirits fearfully. And yet to be\nmisunderstood is the fate of the like of us.",
        "Alas, that the friend of my youth is gone! Alas, that I ever knew\nher! I might say to myself, “You are a dreamer to seek what is\nnot to be found here below.” But she has been mine. I have\npossessed that heart, that noble soul, in whose presence I seemed\nto be more than I really was, because I was all that I could be.\nGood heavens! did then a single power of my soul remain unexercised?\nIn her presence could I not display, to its full extent, that\nmysterious feeling with which my heart embraces nature? Was not\nour intercourse a perpetual web of the finest emotions, of the\nkeenest wit, the varieties of which, even in their very eccentricity,\nbore the stamp of genius? Alas! the few years by which she was\nmy senior brought her to the grave before me. Never can I forget\nher firm mind or her heavenly patience.",
        "A few days ago I met a certain young V—, a frank, open fellow,\nwith a most pleasing countenance. He has just left the university,\ndoes not deem himself overwise, but believes he knows more than\nother people. He has worked hard, as I can perceive from many\ncircumstances, and, in short, possesses a large stock of information.\nWhen he heard that I am drawing a good deal, and that I know Greek\n(two wonderful things for this part of the country), he came to\nsee me, and displayed his whole store of learning, from Batteaux\nto Wood, from De Piles to Winkelmann: he assured me he had read\nthrough the first part of Sultzer’s theory, and also possessed a\nmanuscript of Heyne’s work on the study of the antique. I allowed\nit all to pass.",
        "I have become acquainted, also, with a very worthy person, the\ndistrict judge, a frank and open-hearted man. I am told it is a\nmost delightful thing to see him in the midst of his children, of\nwhom he has nine. His eldest daughter especially is highly spoken\nof. He has invited me to go and see him, and I intend to do so\non the first opportunity. He lives at one of the royal hunting-lodges,\nwhich can be reached from here in an hour and a half by walking,\nand which he obtained leave to inhabit after the loss of his wife,\nas it is so painful to him to reside in town and at the court.",
        "There have also come in my way a few other originals of a questionable\nsort, who are in all respects undesirable, and most intolerable\nin their demonstration of friendship. Good-bye. This letter will\nplease you: it is quite historical.",
        "That the life of man is but a dream, many a man has surmised\nheretofore; and I, too, am everywhere pursued by this feeling.\nWhen I consider the narrow limits within which our active and\ninquiring faculties are confined; when I see how all our energies\nare wasted in providing for mere necessities, which again have no\nfurther end than to prolong a wretched existence; and then that\nall our satisfaction concerning certain subjects of investigation\nends in nothing better than a passive resignation, whilst we amuse\nourselves painting our prison-walls with bright figures and brilliant\nlandscapes, — when I consider all this, Wilhelm, I am silent.\nI examine my own being, and find there a world, but a world rather\nof imagination and dim desires, than of distinctness and living\npower. Then everything swims before my senses, and I smile and\ndream while pursuing my way through the world.",
        "All learned professors and doctors are agreed that children do not\ncomprehend the cause of their desires; but that the grown-up should\nwander about this earth like children, without knowing whence they\ncome, or whither they go, influenced as little by fixed motives,\nbut guided like them by biscuits, sugar-plums, and the rod, — this\nis what nobody is willing to acknowledge; and yet I think it is\npalpable.",
        "I know what you will say in reply; for I am ready to admit that\nthey are happiest, who, like children, amuse themselves with their\nplaythings, dress and undress their dolls, and attentively watch\nthe cupboard, where mamma has locked up her sweet things, and,\nwhen at last they get a delicious morsel, eat it greedily, and\nexclaim, “More!” These are certainly happy beings; but others\nalso are objects of envy, who dignify their paltry employments,\nand sometimes even their passions, with pompous titles, representing\nthem to mankind as gigantic achievements performed for their welfare\nand glory. But the man who humbly acknowledges the vanity of all\nthis, who observes with what pleasure the thriving citizen converts\nhis little garden into a paradise, and how patiently even the poor\nman pursues his weary way under his burden, and how all wish equally\nto behold the light of the sun a little longer, — yes, such a man\nis at peace, and creates his own world within himself; and he is\nalso happy, because he is a man. And then, however limited his\nsphere, he still preserves in his bosom the sweet feeling of liberty,\nand knows that he can quit his prison whenever he likes.",
        "You know of old my ways of settling anywhere, of selecting a little\ncottage in some cosy spot, and of putting up in it with every\ninconvenience. Here, too, I have discovered such a snug, comfortable\nplace, which possesses peculiar charms for me.",
        "About a league from the town is a place called Walheim. (The reader\nneed not take the trouble to look for the place thus designated.\nWe have found it necessary to change the names given in the original.)\nIt is delightfully situated on the side of a hill; and, by proceeding\nalong one of the footpaths which lead out of the village, you can\nhave a view of the whole valley. A good old woman lives there,\nwho keeps a small inn. She sells wine, beer, and coffee, and is\ncheerful and pleasant notwithstanding her age. The chief charm\nof this spot consists in two linden-trees, spreading their enormous\nbranches over the little green before the church, which is entirely\nsurrounded by peasants’ cottages, barns, and homesteads. I have\nseldom seen a place so retired and peaceable; and there often have\nmy table and chair brought out from the little inn, and drink my\ncoffee there, and read my Homer. Accident brought me to the spot\none fine afternoon, and I found it perfectly deserted. Everybody\nwas in the fields except a little boy about four years of age, who\nwas sitting on the ground, and held between his knees a child about\nsix months old: he pressed it to his bosom with both arms, which\nthus formed a sort of arm-chair; and, notwithstanding the liveliness\nwhich sparkled in its black eyes, it remained perfectly still.\nThe sight charmed me. I sat down upon a plough opposite, and\nsketched with great delight this little picture of brotherly\ntenderness. I added the neighbouring hedge, the barn-door, and\nsome broken cart-wheels, just as they happened to lie; and I found\nin about an hour that I had made a very correct and interesting\ndrawing, without putting in the slightest thing of my own. This\nconfirmed me in my resolution of adhering, for the future, entirely\nto nature. She alone is inexhaustible, and capable of forming the\ngreatest masters. Much may be alleged in favour of rules, as much\nmay be likewise advanced in favour of the laws of society: an\nartist formed upon them will never produce anything absolutely bad\nor disgusting; as a man who observes the laws, and obeys decorum,\ncan never be an absolutely intolerable neighbour, nor a decided\nvillain: but yet, say what you will of rules, they destroy the\ngenuine feeling of nature, as well as its true expression. Do not\ntell me “that this is too hard, that they only restrain and prune\nsuperfluous branches, etc.” My good friend, I will illustrate\nthis by an analogy. These things resemble love. A warmhearted\nyouth becomes strongly attached to a maiden: he spends every hour\nof the day in her company, wears out his health, and lavishes his\nfortune, to afford continual proof that he is wholly devoted to\nher. Then comes a man of the world, a man of place and respectability,\nand addresses him thus: “My good young friend, love is natural;\nbut you must love within bounds. Divide your time: devote a portion\nto business, and give the hours of recreation to your mistress.\nCalculate your fortune; and out of the superfluity you may make\nher a present, only not too often, — on her birthday, and such\noccasions.” Pursuing this advice, he may become a useful member\nof society, and I should advise every prince to give him an\nappointment; but it is all up with his love, and with his genius\nif he be an artist. O my friend! why is it that the torrent of\ngenius so seldom bursts forth, so seldom rolls in full-flowing\nstream, overwhelming your astounded soul? Because, on either side\nof this stream, cold and respectable persons have taken up their\nabodes, and, forsooth, their summer-houses and tulip-beds would\nsuffer from the torrent; wherefore they dig trenches, and raise\nembankments betimes, in order to avert the impending danger.",
        "I find I have fallen into raptures, declamation, and similes, and\nhave forgotten, in consequence, to tell you what became of the\nchildren. Absorbed in my artistic contemplations, which I briefly\ndescribed in my letter of yesterday, I continued sitting on the\nplough for two hours. Toward evening a young woman, with a basket\non her arm, came running toward the children, who had not moved\nall that time. She exclaimed from a distance, “You are a good\nboy, Philip!” She gave me greeting: I returned it, rose, and\napproached her. I inquired if she were the mother of those pretty\nchildren. “Yes,” she said; and, giving the eldest a piece of\nbread, she took the little one in her arms and kissed it with a\nmother’s tenderness. “I left my child in Philip’s care,” she said,\n\"whilst I went into the town with my eldest boy to buy some wheaten\nbread, some sugar, and an earthen pot.” I saw the various articles\nin the basket, from which the cover had fallen. “I shall make\nsome broth to-night for my little Hans (which was the name of the\nyoungest): that wild fellow, the big one, broke my pot yesterday,\nwhilst he was scrambling with Philip for what remained of the\ncontents.”  I inquired for the eldest; and she bad scarcely time\nto tell me that he was driving a couple of geese home from the\nmeadow, when he ran up, and handed Philip an osier-twig. I talked\na little longer with the woman, and found that she was the daughter\nof the schoolmaster, and that her husband was gone on a journey\ninto Switzerland for some money a relation had left him. “They\nwanted to cheat him,” she said, “and would not answer his letters;\nso he is gone there himself. I hope he has met with no accident,\nas I have heard nothing of him since his departure.” I left the\nwoman, with regret, giving each of the children a kreutzer, with\nan additional one for the youngest, to buy some wheaten bread for\nhis broth when she went to town next; and so we parted. I assure\nyou, my dear friend, when my thoughts are all in tumult, the sight\nof such a creature as this tranquillises my disturbed mind. She\nmoves in a happy thoughtlessness within the confined circle of her\nexistence; she supplies her wants from day to day; and, when she\nsees the leaves fall, they raise no other idea in her mind than\nthat winter is approaching. Since that time I have gone out there\nfrequently. The children have become quite familiar with me; and\neach gets a lump of sugar when I drink my coffee, and they share\nmy milk and bread and butter in the evening. They always receive\ntheir kreutzer on Sundays, for the good woman has orders to give\nit to them when I do not go there after evening service. They are\nquite at home with me, tell me everything; and I am particularly\namused with observing their tempers, and the simplicity of their\nbehaviour, when some of the other village children are assembled\nwith them.",
        "It has given me a deal of trouble to satisfy the anxiety of the\nmother, lest (as she says) “they should inconvenience the gentleman.”",
        "What I have lately said of painting is equally true with respect\nto poetry. It is only necessary for us to know what is really\nexcellent, and venture to give it expression; and that is saying\nmuch in few words. To-day I have had a scene, which, if literally\nrelated, would, make the most beautiful idyl in the world. But\nwhy should I talk of poetry and scenes and idyls? Can we never\ntake pleasure in nature without having recourse to art?",
        "If you expect anything grand or magnificent from this introduction,\nyou will be sadly mistaken. It relates merely to a peasant-lad,\nwho has excited in me the warmest interest. As usual, I shall\ntell my story badly; and you, as usual, will think me extravagant.\nIt is Walheim once more — always Walheim — which produces these\nwonderful phenomena.",
        "A party had assembled outside the house under the linden-trees,\nto drink coffee. The company did not exactly please me; and, under\none pretext or another, I lingered behind.",
        "A peasant came from an adjoining house, and set to work arranging\nsome part of the same plough which I had lately sketched. His\nappearance pleased me; and I spoke to him, inquired about his\ncircumstances, made his acquaintance, and, as is my wont with\npersons of that class, was soon admitted into his confidence. He\nsaid he was in the service of a young widow, who set great store\nby him. He spoke so much of his mistress, and praised her so\nextravagantly, that I could soon see he was desperately in love\nwith her. “She is no longer young,” he said: “and she was treated\nso badly by her former husband that she does not mean to marry\nagain.” From his account it was so evident what incomparable\ncharms she possessed for him, and how ardently he wished she would\nselect him to extinguish the recollection of her first husband’s\nmisconduct, that I should have to repeat his own words in order\nto describe the depth of the poor fellow’s attachment, truth, and\ndevotion. It would, in fact, require the gifts of a great poet\nto convey the expression of his features, the harmony of his voice,\nand the heavenly fire of his eye. No words can portray the\ntenderness of his every movement and of every feature: no effort\nof mine could do justice to the scene. His alarm lest I should\nmisconceive his position with regard to his mistress, or question\nthe propriety of her conduct, touched me particularly. The charming\nmanner with which he described her form and person, which, without\npossessing the graces of youth, won and attached him to her, is\ninexpressible, and must be left to the imagination. I have never\nin my life witnessed or fancied or conceived the possibility of\nsuch intense devotion, such ardent affections, united with so much\npurity. Do not blame me if I say that the recollection of this\ninnocence and truth is deeply impressed upon my very soul; that\nthis picture of fidelity and tenderness haunts me everywhere; and\nthat my own heart, as though enkindled by the flame, glows and\nburns within me.",
        "I mean now to try and see her as soon as I can: or perhaps, on\nsecond thoughts, I had better not; it is better I should behold\nher through the eyes of her lover. To my sight, perhaps, she would\nnot appear as she now stands before me; and why should I destroy\nso sweet a picture?",
        "“Why do I not write to you?” You lay claim to learning, and ask\nsuch a question. You should have guessed that I am well — that\nis to say — in a word, I have made an acquaintance who has won\nmy heart: I have — I know not.",
        "To give you a regular account of the manner in which I have become\nacquainted with the most amiable of women would be a difficult task.\nI am a happy and contented mortal, but a poor historian.",
        "An angel! Nonsense! Everybody so describes his mistress; and yet\nI find it impossible to tell you how perfect she is, or why she is\nso perfect: suffice it to say she has captivated all my senses.",
        "So much simplicity with so much understauding — so mild, and yet\nso resolute — a mind so placid, and a life so active.",
        "But all this is ugly balderdash, which expresses not a single\ncharacter nor feature. Some other time — but no, not some other\ntime, now, this very instant, will I tell you all about it. Now\nor never. Well, between ourselves, since I commenced my letter,\nI have been three times on the point of throwing down my pen, of\nordering my horse, and riding out. And yet I vowed this morning\nthat I would not ride to-day, and yet every moment I am rushing\nto the window to see how high the sun is.",
        "I could not restrain myself — go to her I must. I have just\nreturned, Wilhelm; and whilst I am taking supper I will write to\nyou. What a delight it was for my soul to see her in the midst\nof her dear, beautiful children, — eight brothers and sisters!",
        "But, if I proceed thus, you will be no wiser at the end of my\nletter than you were at the beginning. Attend, then, and I will\ncompel myself to give you the details.",
        "I mentioned to you the other day that I had become acquainted with\nS—, the district judge, and that he had invited me to go and visit\nhim in his retirement, or rather in his little kingdom. But I\nneglected going, and perhaps should never have gone, if chance had\nnot discovered to me the treasure which lay concealed in that\nretired spot. Some of our young people had proposed giving a ball\nin the country, at which I consented to be present. I offered my\nhand for the evening to a pretty and agreeable, but rather commonplace,\nsort of girl from the immediate neighbourhood; and it was agreed\nthat I should engage a carriage, and call upon Charlotte, with my\npartner and her aunt, to convey them to the ball. My companion\ninformed me, as we drove along through the park to the hunting-lodge,\nthat I should make the acquaintance of a very charming young lady.\n\"Take care,” added the aunt, “that you do not lose your heart.\"\n\"Why?” said I. “Because she is already engaged to a very worthy\nman,” she replied, “who is gone to settle his affairs upon the\ndeath of his father, and will succeed to a very considerable\ninheritance.” This information possessed no interest for me.\nWhen we arrived at the gate, the sun was setting behind the tops\nof the mountains. The atmosphere was heavy; and the ladies expressed\ntheir fears of an approaching storm, as masses of low black clouds\nwere gathering in the horizon. I relieved their anxieties by\npretending to be weather-wise, although I myself had some\napprehensions lest our pleasure should be interrupted.",
        "I alighted; and a maid came to the door, and requested us to wait\na moment for her mistress. I walked across the court to a well-built\nhouse, and, ascending the flight of steps in front, opened the door,\nand saw before me the most charming spectacle I had ever witnessed.\nSix children, from eleven to two years old, were running about the\nhall, and surrounding a lady of middle height, with a lovely figure,\ndressed in a robe of simple white, trimmed with pink ribbons. She\nwas holding a rye loaf in her hand, and was cutting slices for the\nlittle ones all around, in proportion to their age and appetite.\nShe performed her task in a graceful and affectionate manner; each\nclaimant awaiting his turn with outstretched hands, and boisterously\nshouting his thanks. Some of them ran away at once, to enjoy their\nevening meal; whilst others, of a gentler disposition, retired to\nthe courtyard to see the strangers, and to survey the carriage in\nwhich their Charlotte was to drive away. “Pray forgive me for\ngiving you the trouble to come for me, and for keeping the ladies\nwaiting: but dressing, and arranging some household duties before\nI leave, had made me forget my children’s supper; and they do not\nlike to take it from any one but me.” I uttered some indifferent\ncompliment: but my whole soul was absorbed by her air, her voice,\nher manner; and I had scarcely recovered myself when she ran into\nher room to fetch her gloves and fan. The young ones threw inquiring\nglances at me from a distance; whilst I approached the youngest,\na most delicious little creature. He drew back; and Charlotte,\nentering at the very moment, said, “Louis, shake hands with your\ncousin.” The little fellow obeyed willingly; and I could not\nresist giving him a hearty kiss, notwithstanding his rather dirty\nface. “Cousin,” said I to Charlotte, as I handed her down, “do\nyou think I deserve the happiness of being related to you?” She\nreplied, with a ready smile, “Oh! I have such a number of cousins,\nthat I should be sorry if you were the most undeserving of them.\"\nIn taking leave, she desired her next sister, Sophy, a girl about\neleven years old, to take great care of the children, and to say\ngood-bye to papa for her when he came home from his ride. She\nenjoined to the little ones to obey their sister Sophy as they\nwould herself, upon which some promised that they would; but a\nlittle fair-haired girl, about six years old, looked discontented,\nand said, “But Sophy is not you, Charlotte; and we like you best.\"\nThe two eldest boys had clambered up the carriage; and, at my\nrequest, she permitted them to accompany us a little way through\nthe forest, upon their promising to sit very still, and hold fast.",
        "We were hardly seated, and the ladies had scarcely exchanged\ncompliments, making the usual remarks upon each other’s dress, and\nupon the company they expected to meet, when Charlotte stopped the\ncarriage, and made her brothers get down. They insisted upon\nkissing her hands once more; which the eldest did with all the\ntenderness of a youth of fifteen, but the other in a lighter and\nmore careless manner. She desired them again to give her love to\nthe children, and we drove off.",
        "The aunt inquired of Charlotte whether she had finished the book\nshe had last sent her. “No,” said Charlotte; “I did not like it:\nyou can have it again. And the one before was not much better.\"\nI was surprised, upon asking the title, to hear that it was ____.\n(We feel obliged to suppress the passage in the letter, to prevent\nany one from feeling aggrieved; although no author need pay much\nattention to the opinion of a mere girl, or that of an unsteady\nyoung man.)",
        "I found penetration and character in everything she said: every\nexpression seemed to brighten her features with new charms, —with\nnew rays of genius, — which unfolded by degrees, as she felt\nherself understood.",
        "“When I was younger,” she observed, “I loved nothing so much as\nromances. Nothing could equal my delight when, on some holiday,\nI could settle down quietly in a corner, and enter with my whole\nheart and soul into the joys or sorrows of some fictitious Leonora.\nI do not deny that they even possess some charms for me yet. But\nI read so seldom, that I prefer books suited exactly to my taste.\nAnd I like those authors best whose scenes describe my own situation\nin life, — and the friends who are about me, whose stories touch\nme with interest, from resembling my own homely existence, — which,\nwithout being absolutely paradise, is, on the whole, a source of\nindescribable happiness.”",
        "I endeavoured to conceal the emotion which these words occasioned,\nbut it was of slight avail; for, when she had expressed so truly\nher opinion of “The Vicar of Wakefield,” and of other works, the\nnames of which I omit (Though the names are omitted, yet the authors\nmentioned deserve Charlotte’s approbation, and will feel it in\ntheir hearts when they read this passage. It concerns no other\nperson.), I could no longer contain myself, but gave full utterance\nto what I thought of it: and it was not until Charlotte had addressed\nherself to the two other ladies, that I remembered their presence,\nand observed them sitting mute with astonishment. The aunt looked\nat me several times with an air of raillery, which, however, I did\nnot at all mind.",
        "We talked of the pleasures of dancing. “If it is a fault to love\nit,” said Charlotte, “I am ready to confess that I prize it above\nall other amusements. If anything disturbs me, I go to the piano,\nplay an air to which I have danced, and all goes right again\ndirectly.”",
        "You, who know me, can fancy how steadfastly I gazed upon her rich\ndark eyes during these remarks, how my very soul gloated over her\nwarm lips and fresh, glowing cheeks, how I became quite lost in\nthe delightful meaning of her words, so much so, that I scarcely\nheard the actual expressions. In short, I alighted from the\ncarriage like a person in a dream, and was so lost to the dim\nworld around me, that I scarcely heard the music which resounded\nfrom the illuminated ballroom.",
        "The two Messrs. Andran and a certain N. N. (I cannot trouble myself\nwith the names), who were the aunt’s and Charlotte’s partners,\nreceived us at the carriage-door, and took possession of their\nladies, whilst I followed with mine.",
        "We commenced with a minuet. I led out one lady after another,\nand precisely those who were the most disagreeable could not bring\nthemselves to leave off. Charlotte and her partner began an English\ncountry dance, and you must imagine my delight when it was their\nturn to dance the figure with us. You should see Charlotte dance.\nShe dances with her whole heart and soul: her figure is all harmony,\nelegance, and grace, as if she were conscious of nothing else, and\nhad no other thought or feeling; and, doubtless, for the moment,\nevery other sensation is extinct.",
        "She was engaged for the second country dance, but promised me the\nthird, and assured me, with the most agreeable freedom, that she\nwas very fond of waltzing. “It is the custom here,” she said,\n\"for the previous partners to waltz together; but my partner is\nan indifferent waltzer, and will feel delighted if I save him the\ntrouble. Your partner is not allowed to waltz, and, indeed, is\nequally incapable: but I observed during the country dance that\nyou waltz well; so, if you will waltz with me, I beg you would\npropose it to my partner, and I will propose it to yours.” We\nagreed, and it was arranged that our partners should mutually\nentertain each other.",
        "We set off, and, at first, delighted ourselves with the usual\ngraceful motions of the arms. With what grace, with what ease,\nshe moved! When the waltz commenced, and the dancers whirled\naround each other in the giddy maze, there was some confusion,\nowing to the incapacity of some of the dancers. We judiciously\nremained still, allowing the others to weary themselves; and, when\nthe awkward dancers had withdrawn, we joined in, and kept it up\nfamously together with one other couple, — Andran and his partner.\nNever did I dance more lightly. I felt myself more than mortal,\nholding this loveliest of creatures in my arms, flying, with her\nas rapidly as the wind, till I lost sight of every other object;\nand O Wilhelm, I vowed at that moment, that a maiden whom I loved,\nor for whom I felt the slightest attachment, never, never should\nwaltz with any one else but with me, if I went to perdition for it!\n— you will understand this.",
        "We took a few turns in the room to recover our breath. Charlotte\nsat down, and felt refreshed by partaking of some oranges which I\nhad had secured, — the only ones that had been left; but at every\nslice which, from politeness, she offered to her neighbours, I felt\nas though a dagger went through my heart.",
        "We were the second couple in the third country dance. As we were\ngoing down (and Heaven knows with what ecstasy I gazed at her arms\nand eyes, beaming with the sweetest feeling of pure and genuine\nenjoyment), we passed a lady whom I had noticed for her charming\nexpression of countenance; although she was no longer young. She\nlooked at Charlotte with a smile, then, holding up her finger in\na threatening attitude, repeated twice in a very significant tone\nof voice the name of “Albert.”",
        "“Who is Albert,” said I to Charlotte, “if it is not impertinent\nto ask?” She was about to answer, when we were obliged to separate,\nin order to execute a figure in the dance; and, as we crossed over\nagain in front of each other, I perceived she looked somewhat\npensive. “Why need I conceal it from you?” she said, as she gave\nme her hand for the promenade. “Albert is a worthy man, to whom\nI am engaged.” Now, there was nothing new to me in this (for the\ngirls had told me of it on the way); but it was so far new that\nI had not thought of it in connection with her whom, in so short\na time, I had learned to prize so highly. Enough, I became confused,\ngot out in the figure, and occasioned general confusion; so that\nit required all Charlotte’s presence of mind to set me right by\npulling and pushing me into my proper place.",
        "The dance was not yet finished when the lightning which had for\nsome time been seen in the horizon, and which I had asserted to\nproceed entirely from heat, grew more violent; and the thunder was\nheard above the music. When any distress or terror surprises us\nin the midst of our amusements, it naturally makes a deeper impression\nthan at other times, either because the contrast makes us more\nkeenly susceptible, or rather perhaps because our senses are then\nmore open to impressions, and the shock is consequently stronger.\nTo this cause I must ascribe the fright and shrieks of the ladies.\nOne sagaciously sat down in a corner with her back to the window,\nand held her fingers to her ears; a second knelt down before her,\nand hid her face in her lap; a third threw herself between them,\nand embraced her sister with a thousand tears; some insisted on\ngoing home; others, unconscious of their actions, wanted sufficient\npresence of mind to repress the impertinence of their young partners,\nwho sought to direct to themselves those sighs which the lips of\nour agitated beauties intended for heaven. Some of the gentlemen\nhad gone down-stairs to smoke a quiet cigar, and the rest of the\ncompany gladly embraced a happy suggestion of the hostess to retire\ninto another room which was provided with shutters and curtains.\nWe had hardly got there, when Charlotte placed the chairs in a\ncircle; and, when the company had sat down in compliance with her\nrequest, she forthwith proposed a round game.",
        "I noticed some of the company prepare their mouths and draw\nthemselves up at the prospect of some agreeable forfeit. “Let us\nplay at counting,” said Charlotte. “Now, pay attention: I shall\ngo round the circle from right to left; and each person is to count,\none after the other, the number that comes to him, and must count\nfast; whoever stops or mistakes is to have a box on the ear, and\nso on, till we have counted a thousand.” It was delightful to see\nthe fun. She went round the circle with upraised arm. “One,\"\nsaid the first; “two,” the second; “three,” the third; and so on,\ntill Charlotte went faster and faster. One made a mistake, instantly\na box on the ear; and, amid the laughter that ensued, came another\nbox; and so on, faster and faster. I myself came in for two. I\nfancied they were harder than the rest, and felt quite delighted.\nA general laughter and confusion put an end to the game long before\nwe had counted as far as a thousand. The party broke up into\nlittle separate knots: the storm had ceased, and I followed Charlotte\ninto the ballroom. On the way she said, “The game banished their\nfears of the storm.” I could make no reply. “I myself,” she\ncontinued, “was as much frightened as any of them; but by affecting\ncourage, to keep up the spirits of the others, I forgot my\napprehensions.” We went to the window. It was still thundering\nat a distance: a soft rain was pouring down over the country,\nand filled the air around us with delicious odours. Charlotte\nleaned forward on her arm; her eyes wandered over the scene; she\nraised them to the sky, and then turned them upon me; they were\nmoistened with tears; she placed her hand on mine and said,\n\"Klopstock!” at once I remembered the magnificent ode which was\nin her thoughts: I felt oppressed with the weight of my sensations,\nand sank under them. It was more than I could bear. I bent over\nher hand, kissed it in a stream of delicious tears, and again\nlooked up to her eyes. Divine Klopstock! why didst thou not see\nthy apotheosis in those eyes? And thy name so often profaned,\nwould that I never heard it repeated!",
        "I no longer remember where I stopped in my narrative: I only know\nit was two in the morning when I went to bed; and if you had been\nwith me, that I might have talked instead of writing to you, I\nshould, in all probability, have kept you up till daylight.",
        "I think I have not yet related what happened as we rode home from\nthe ball, nor have I time to tell you now. It was a most magnificent\nsunrise: the whole country was refreshed, and the rain fell drop\nby drop from the trees in the forest. Our companions were asleep.\nCharlotte asked me if I did not wish to sleep also, and begged of\nme not to make any ceremony on her account. Looking steadfastly\nat her, I answered, “As long as I see those eyes open, there is\nno fear of my falling asleep.” We both continued awake till we\nreached her door. The maid opened it softly, and assured her, in\nanswer to her inquiries, that her father and the children were\nwell, and still sleeping. I left her asking permission to visit\nher in the course of the day. She consented, and I went, and,\nsince that time, sun, moon, and stars may pursue their course: I\nknow not whether it is day or night; the whole world is nothing\nto me.",
        "My days are as happy as those reserved by God for his elect; and,\nwhatever be my fate hereafter, I can never say that I have not\ntasted joy, — the purest joy of life. You know Walheim. I am\nnow completely settled there. In that spot I am only half a league\nfrom Charlotte; and there I enjoy myself, and taste all the pleasure\nwhich can fall to the lot of man. ",
        "Little did I imagine, when I selected Walheim for my pedestrian\nexcursions, that all heaven lay so near it. How often in my\nwanderings from the hillside or from the meadows across the river,\nhave I beheld this hunting-lodge, which now contains within it all\nthe joy of my heart!",
        "I have often, my dear Wilhelm, reflected on the eagerness men feel\nto wander and make new discoveries, and upon that secret impulse\nwhich afterward inclines them to return to their narrow circle,\nconform to the laws of custom, and embarrass themselves no longer\nwith what passes around them.",
        "It is so strange how, when I came here first, and gazed upon that\nlovely valley from the hillside, I felt charmed with the entire\nscene surrounding me. The little wood opposite — how delightful\nto sit under its shade! How fine the view from that point of\nrock! Then, that delightful chain of hills, and the exquisite\nvalleys at their feet! Could I but wander and lose myself amongst\nthem! I went, and returned without finding what I wished. Distance,\nmy friend, is like futurity. A dim vastness is spread before our\nsouls: the perceptions of our mind are as obscure as those of our\nvision; and we desire earnestly to surrender up our whole being,\nthat it may be filled with the complete and perfect bliss of one\nglorious emotion. But alas! when we have attained our object,\nwhen the distant there becomes the present here, all is changed:\nwe are as poor and circumscribed as ever, and our souls still\nlanguish for unattainable happiness.",
        "So does the restless traveller pant for his native soil, and find\nin his own cottage, in the arms of his wife, in the affections of\nhis children, and in the labour necessary for their support, that\nhappiness which he had sought in vain through the wide world.",
        "When, in the morning at sunrise, I go out to Walheim, and with my\nown hands gather in the garden the pease which are to serve for\nmy dinner, when I sit down to shell them, and read my Homer during\nthe intervals, and then, selecting a saucepan from the kitchen,\nfetch my own butter, put my mess on the fire, cover it up, and sit\ndown to stir it as occasion requires, I figure to myself the\nillustrious suitors of Penelope, killing, dressing, and preparing\ntheir own oxen and swine. Nothing fills me with a more pure and\ngenuine sense of happiness than those traits of patriarchal life\nwhich, thank Heaven! I can imitate without affectation. Happy is\nit, indeed, for me that my heart is capable of feeling the same\nsimple and innocent pleasure as the peasant whose table is covered\nwith food of his own rearing, and who not only enjoys his meal, but\nremembers with delight the happy days and sunny mornings when he\nplanted it, the soft evenings when he watered it, and the pleasure\nhe experienced in watching its daily growth.",
        "The day before yesterday, the physician came from the town to pay\na visit to the judge. He found me on the floor playing with\nCharlotte’s children. Some of them were scrambling over me, and\nothers romped with me; and, as I caught and tickled them, they\nmade a great noise. The doctor is a formal sort of personage: he\nadjusts the plaits of his ruffles, and continually settles his\nfrill whilst he is talking to you; and he thought my conduct beneath\nthe dignity of a sensible man. I could perceive this by his\ncountenance. But I did not suffer myself to be disturbed. I\nallowed him to continue his wise conversation, whilst I rebuilt\nthe children’s card houses for them as fast as they threw them\ndown. He went about the town afterward, complaining that the\njudge’s children were spoiled enough before, but that now Werther\nwas completely ruining them.",
        "Yes, my dear Wilhelm, nothing on this earth affects my heart so\nmuch as children. When I look on at their doings; when I mark in\nthe little creatures the seeds of all those virtues and qualities\nwhich they will one day find so indispensable; when I behold in\nthe obstinate all the future firmness and constancy of a noble\ncharacter; in the capricious, that levity and gaiety of temper\nwhich will carry them lightly over the dangers and troubles of\nlife, their whole nature simple and unpolluted, — then I call\nto mind the golden words of the Great Teacher of mankind, “Unless\nye become like one of these!” And now, my friend, these children,\nwho are our equals, whom we ought to consider as our models, we\ntreat them as though they were our subjects. They are allowed no\nwill of their own. And have we, then, none ourselves? Whence comes\nour exclusive right? Is it because we are older and more experienced?\nGreat God! from the height of thy heaven thou beholdest great\nchildren and little children, and no others; and thy Son has long\nsince declared which afford thee greatest pleasure. But they\nbelieve in him, and hear him not, —that, too, is an old story;\nand they train their children after their own image, etc.",
        "Adieu, Wilhelm: I will not further bewilder myself with this subject.",
        "The consolation Charlotte can bring to an invalid I experience\nfrom my own heart, which suffers more from her absence than many\na poor creature lingering on a bed of sickness. She is gone to\nspend a few days in the town with a very worthy woman, who is given\nover by the physicians, and wishes to have Charlotte near her in\nher last moments. I accompanied her last week on a visit to the\nVicar of S—, a small village in the mountains, about a league\nhence. We arrived about four o’clock: Charlotte had taken her\nlittle sister with her. When we entered the vicarage court, we\nfound the good old man sitting on a bench before the door, under\nthe shade of two large walnut-trees. At the sight of Charlotte\nhe seemed to gain new life, rose, forgot his stick, and ventured\nto walk toward her. She ran to him, and made him sit down again;\nthen, placing herself by his side, she gave him a number of messages\nfrom her father, and then caught up his youngest child, a dirty,\nugly little thing, the joy of his old age, and kissed it. I wish\nyou could have witnessed her attention to this old man, —how she\nraised her voice on account of his deafness; how she told him of\nhealthy young people, who had been carried off when it was least\nexpected; praised the virtues of Carlsbad, and commended his\ndetermination to spend the ensuing summer there; and assured him\nthat he looked better and stronger than he did when she saw him\nlast. I, in the meantime, paid attention to his good lady. The\nold man seemed quite in spirits; and as I could not help admiring\nthe beauty of the walnut-trees, which formed such an agreeable\nshade over our heads, he began, though with some little difficulty,\nto tell us their history. “As to the oldest,” said he, “we do not\nknow who planted it, — some say one clergyman, and some another:\nbut the younger one, there behind us, is exactly the age of my wife,\nfifty years old next October; her father planted it in the morning,\nand in the evening she came into the world. My wife’s father was\nmy predecessor here, and I cannot tell you how fond he was of that\ntree; and it is fully as dear to me. Under the shade of that very\ntree, upon a log of wood, my wife was seated knitting, when I, a\npoor student, came into this court for the first time, just seven\nand twenty years ago.” Charlotte inquired for his daughter. He\nsaid she was gone with Herr Schmidt to the meadows, and was with\nthe haymakers. The old man then resumed his story, and told us\nhow his predecessor had taken a fancy to him, as had his daughter\nlikewise; and how he had become first his curate, and subsequently\nhis successor. He had scarcely finished his story when his daughter\nreturned through the garden, accompanied by the above-mentioned\nHerr Schmidt. She welcomed Charlotte affectionately, and I confess\nI was much taken with her appearance. She was a lively-looking,\ngood-humoured brunette, quite competent to amuse one for a short\ntime in the country. Her lover (for such Herr Schmidt evidently\nappeared to be) was a polite, reserved personage, and would not\njoin our conversation, notwithstanding all Charlotte’s endeavours\nto draw him out. I was much annoyed at observing, by his countenance,\nthat his silence did not arise from want of talent, but from caprice\nand ill-humour. This subsequently became very evident, when we\nset out to take a walk, and Frederica joining Charlotte, with whom\nI was talking, the worthy gentleman’s face, which was naturally\nrather sombre, became so dark and angry that Charlotte was obliged\nto touch my arm, and remind me that I was talking too much to\nFrederica. Nothing distresses me more than to see men torment\neach other; particularly when in the flower of their age, in the\nvery season of pleasure, they waste their few short days of sunshine\nin quarrels and disputes, and only perceive their error when it\nis too late to repair it. This thought dwelt upon my mind; and\nin the evening, when we returned to the vicar’s, and were sitting\nround the table with our bread end milk, the conversation turned\non the joys and sorrows of the world, I could not resist the\ntemptation to inveigh bitterly against ill-humour. “We are apt,\"\nsaid I, “to complain, but - with very little cause, that our happy\ndays are few, and our evil days many. If our hearts were always\ndisposed to receive the benefits Heaven sends us, we should acquire\nstrength to support evil when it comes.” “But,” observed the vicar’s\nwife, “we cannot always command our tempers, so much depends upon\nthe constitution: when the body suffers, the mind is ill at ease.\"\n\"I acknowledge that,” I continued; “but we must consider such a\ndisposition in the light of a disease, and inquire whether there\nis no remedy for it.”",
        "“I should be glad to hear one,” said Charlotte: “at least, I think\nvery much depends upon ourselves; I know it is so with me. When\nanything annoys me, and disturbs my temper, I hasten into the\ngarden, hum a couple of country dances, and it is all right with\nme directly.” “That is what I meant,” I replied; “ill-humour\nresembles indolence: it is natural to us; but if once we have\ncourage to exert ourselves, we find our work run fresh from our\nhands, and we experience in the activity from which we shrank a\nreal enjoyment.” Frederica listened very attentively: and the\nyoung man objected, that we were not masters of ourselves, and\nstill less so of our feelings. “The question is about a disagreeable\nfeeling,” I added, “from which every one would willingly escape,\nbut none know their own power without trial. Invalids are glad\nto consult physicians, and submit to the most scrupulous regimen,\nthe most nauseous medicines, in order to recover their health.\"\nI observed that the good old man inclined his head, and exerted\nhimself to hear our discourse; so I raised my voice, and addressed\nmyself directly to him. We preach against a great many crimes,\"\nI observed, “but I never remember a sermon delivered against\nill-humour.” “That may do very well for your town clergymen,\"\nsaid he: “country people are never ill-humoured; though, indeed,\nit might be useful, occasionally, to my wife for instance, and the\njudge.” We all laughed, as did he likewise very cordially, till\nhe fell into a fit of coughing, which interrupted our conversation\nfor a time. Herr Schmidt resumed the subject. “You call ill\nhumour a crime,” he remarked, “but I think you use too strong a\nterm.” “Not at all,” I replied, “if that deserves the name which\nis so pernicious to ourselves and our neighbours. Is it not enough\nthat we want the power to make one another happy, must we deprive\neach other of the pleasure which we can all make for ourselves?\nShow me the man who has the courage to hide his ill-humour, who\nbears the whole burden himself, without disturbing the peace of\nthose around him. No: ill-humour arises from an inward consciousness\nof our own want of merit, from a discontent which ever accompanies\nthat envy which foolish vanity engenders. We see people happy,\nwhom we have not made so, and cannot endure the sight.” Charlotte\nlooked at me with a smile; she observed the emotion with which I\nspoke: and a tear in the eyes of Frederica stimulated me to proceed.\n\"Woe unto those,” I said, “who use their power over a human heart\nto destroy the simple pleasures it would naturally enjoy! All the\nfavours, all the attentions, in the world cannot compensate for\nthe loss of that happiness which a cruel tyranny has destroyed.\"\nMy heart was full as I spoke. A recollection of many things which\nhad happened pressed upon my mind, and filled my eyes with tears.\n\"We should daily repeat to ourselves,” I exclaimed, “that we should\nnot interfere with our friends, unless to leave them in possession\nof their own joys, and increase their happiness by sharing it with\nthem! But when their souls are tormented by a violent passion,\nor their hearts rent with grief, is it in your power to afford\nthem the slightest consolation?",
        "“And when the last fatal malady seizes the being whose untimely\ngrave you have prepared, when she lies languid and exhausted before\nyou, her dim eyes raised to heaven, and the damp of death upon her\npallid brow, there you stand at her bedside like a condemned\ncriminal, with the bitter feeling that your whole fortune could\nnot save her; and the agonising thought wrings you, that all your\nefforts are powerless to impart even a moment’s strength to the\ndeparting soul, or quicken her with a transitory consolation.”",
        "At these words the remembrance of a similar scene at which I had\nbeen once present fell with full force upon my heart. I buried my\nface in my handkerchief, and hastened from the room, and was only\nrecalled to my recollection by Charlotte’s voice, who reminded me\nthat it was time to return home. With what tenderness she chid\nme on the way for the too eager interest I took in everything!\nShe declared it would do me injury, and that I ought to spare\nmyself. Yes, my angel! I will do so for your sake.",

        "She is still with her dying friend, and is still the same bright,\nbeautiful creature whose presence softens pain, and sheds happiness\naround whichever way she turns. She went out yesterday with her\nlittle sisters: I knew it, and went to meet them; and we walked\ntogether. In about an hour and a half we returned to the town.\nWe stopped at the spring I am so fond of, and which is now a\nthousand times dearer to me than ever. Charlotte seated herself\nupon the low wall, and we gathered about her. I looked around,\nand recalled the time when my heart was unoccupied and free.\n\"Dear fountain!” I said, “since that time I have no more come to\nenjoy cool repose by thy fresh stream: I have passed thee with\ncareless steps, and scarcely bestowed a glance upon thee.” I\nlooked down, and observed Charlotte’s little sister, Jane, coming\nup the steps with a glass of water. I turned toward Charlotte,\nand I felt her influence over me. Jane at the moment approached\nwith the glass. Her sister, Marianne, wished to take it from her.\n\"No!” cried the child, with the sweetest expression of face,\n\"Charlotte must drink first.”",
        "The affection and simplicity with which this was uttered so charmed\nme, that I sought to express my feelings by catching up the child\nand kissing her heartily. She was frightened, and began to cry.\n\"You should not do that,” said Charlotte: I felt perplexed. “Come,\nJane,” she continued, taking her hand, and leading her down the\nsteps again, “it is no matter: wash yourself quickly in the fresh\nwater.” I stood and watched them; and when I saw the little dear\nrubbing her cheeks with her wet hands, in full belief that all\nthe impurities contracted from my ugly beard would be washed off\nby the miraculous water, and how, though Charlotte said it would\ndo, she continued still to wash with all her might, as though she\nthought too much were better than too little, I assure you, Wilhelm,\nI never attended a baptism with greater reverence; and, when\nCharlotte came up from the well, I could have prostrated myself\nas before the prophet of an Eastern nation.",
        "In the evening I would not resist telling the story to a person\nwho, I thought, possessed some natural feeling, because he was a\nman of understanding. But what a mistake I made. He maintained\nit was very wrong of Charlotte, that we should not deceive children,\nthat such things occasioned countless mistakes and superstitions,\nfrom which we were bound to protect the young. It occurred to me\nthen, that this very man had been baptised only a week before; so\nI said nothing further, but maintained the justice of my own\nconvictions. We should deal with children as God deals with us,\nwe are happiest under the influence of innocent delusions.",
        "What a child is man that he should be so solicitous about a look!\nWhat a child is man! We had been to Walheim: the ladies went in\na carriage; but during our walk I thought I saw in Charlotte’s\ndark eyes — I am a fool — but forgive me! you should see them,\n— those eyes. — However, to be brief (for my own eyes are weighed\ndown with sleep), you must know, when the ladies stepped into their\ncarriage again, young W. Seldstadt, Andran, and I were standing\nabout the door. They are a merry set of fellows, and they were\nall laughing and joking together. I watched Charlotte’s eyes.\nThey wandered from one to the other; but they did not light on me,\non me, who stood there motionless, and who saw nothing but her!\nMy heart bade her a thousand times adieu, but she noticed me not.\nThe carriage drove off; and my eyes filled with tears. I looked\nafter her: suddenly I saw Charlotte’s bonnet leaning out of the\nwindow, and she turned to look back, was it at me? My dear friend,\nI know not; and in this uncertainty I find consolation. Perhaps\nshe turned to look at me. Perhaps! Good-night — what a child I am!",
        "You should see how foolish I look in company when her name is\nmentioned, particularly when I am asked plainly how I like her.\nHow I like her! I detest the phrase. What sort of creature must\nhe be who merely liked Charlotte, whose whole heart and senses\nwere not entirely absorbed by her. Like her! Some one asked me\nlately how I liked Ossian.",
        "Madame M— is very ill. I pray for her recovery, because Charlotte\nshares my sufferings. I see her occasionally at my friend’s house,\nand to-day she has told me the strangest circumstance. Old M—\nis a covetous, miserly fellow, who has long worried and annoyed\nthe poor lady sadly; but she has borne her afflictions patiently.\nA few days ago, when the physician informed us that her recovery\nwas hopeless, she sent for her husband (Charlotte was present),\nand addressed him thus: “I have something to confess, which, after\nmy decease, may occasion trouble and confusion. I have hitherto\nconducted your household as frugally and economically as possible,\nbut you must pardon me for having defrauded you for thirty years.\nAt the commencement of our married life, you allowed a small sum\nfor the wants of the kitchen, and the other household expenses.\nWhen our establishment increased and our property grew larger, I\ncould not persuade you to increase the weekly allowance in proportion:\nin short, you know, that, when our wants were greatest, you required\nme to supply everything with seven florins a week. I took the\nmoney from you without an observation, but made up the weekly\ndeficiency from the money-chest; as nobody would suspect your wife\nof robbing the household bank. But I have wasted nothing, and\nshould have been content to meet my eternal Judge without this\nconfession, if she, upon whom the management of your establishment\nwill devolve after my decease, would be free from embarrassment\nupon your insisting that the allowance made to me, your former\nwife, was sufficient.”",
        "I talked with Charlotte of the inconceivable manner in which men\nallow themselves to be blinded; how any one could avoid suspecting\nsome deception, when seven florins only were allowed to defray\nexpenses twice as great. But I have myself known people who\nbelieved, without any visible astonishment, that their house\npossessed the prophet’s never-failing cruse of oil.",
        "No, I am not deceived. In her dark eyes I read a genuine interest\nin me and in my fortunes. Yes, I feel it; and I may believe my\nown heart which tells me — dare I say it? — dare I pronounce\nthe divine words? — that she loves me!",
        "That she loves me! How the idea exalts me in my own eyes! And,\nas you can understand my feelings, I may say to you, how I honour\nmyself since she loves me!",
        "Is this presumption, or is it a consciousness of the truth? I do\nnot know a man able to supplant me in the heart of Charlotte; and\nyet when she speaks of her betrothed with so much warmth and\naffection, I feel like the soldier who has been stripped of his\nhonours and titles, and deprived of his sword.",
        "How my heart beats when by accident I touch her finger, or my feet\nmeet hers under the table! I draw back as if from a furnace; but\na secret force impels me forward again, and my senses become\ndisordered. Her innocent, unconscious heart never knows what agony\nthese little familiarities inflict upon me. Sometimes when we\nare talking she Iays her hand upon mine, and in the eagerness of\nconversation comes closer to me, and her balmy breath reaches my\nlips, — when I feel as if lightning had struck me, and that I\ncould sink into the earth. And yet, Wilhelm, with all this heavenly\nconfidence, — if I know myself, and should ever dare — you\nunderstand me. No, no! my heart is not so corrupt, it is weak,\nweak enough but is not that a degree of corruption?",
        "She is to me a sacred being. All passion is still in her presence:\nI cannot express my sensations when I am near her. I feel as if\nmy soul beat in every nerve of my body. There is a melody which\nshe plays on the piano with angelic skill, — so simple is it,\nand yet so spiritual! It is her favourite air; and, when she\nplays the first note, all pain, care, and sorrow disappear from\nme in a moment.",
        "I believe every word that is said of the magic of ancient music.\nHow her simple song enchants me! Sometimes, when I am ready to\ncommit suicide, she sings that air; and instantly the gloom and\nmadness which hung over me are dispersed, and I breathe freely\nagain.",
        "Wilhelm, what is the world to our hearts without love? What is\na magic-lantern without light? You have but to kindle the flame\nwithin, and the brightest figures shine on the white wall; and,\nif love only show us fleeting shadows, we are yet happy, when,\nlike mere children, we behold them, and are transported with the\nsplendid phantoms. I have not been able to see Charlotte to-day.\nI was prevented by company from which I could not disengage myself.\nWhat was to be done? I sent my servant to her house, that I might\nat least see somebody to-day who had been near her. Oh, the\nimpatience with which I waited for his return! the joy with which\nI welcomed him! I should certainly have caught him in my arms,\nand kissed him, if I had not been ashamed.",
        "It is said that the Bonona stone, when placed in the sun, attracts\nthe rays, and for a time appears luminous in the dark. So was it\nwith me and this servant. The idea that Charlotte’s eyes had dwelt\non his countenance, his cheek, his very apparel, endeared them all\ninestimably to me, so that at the moment I would not have parted\nfrom him for a thousand crowns. His presence made me so happy!\nBeware of laughing at me, Wilhelm. Can that be a delusion which\nmakes us happy?",
        "“I shall see her today!” I exclaim with delight, when I rise in\nthe morning, and look out with gladness of heart at the bright,\nbeautiful sun. “I shall see her today!” And then I have no\nfurther wish to form: all, all is included in that one thought.",
        "I cannot assent to your proposal that I should accompany the\nambassador to _______. I do not love subordination; and we all\nknow that he is a rough, disagreeable person to be connected with.\nYou say my mother wishes me to be employed. I could not help\nlaughing at that. Am I not sufficiently employed? And is it not\nin reality the same, whether I shell peas or count lentils? The\nworld runs on from one folly to another; and the man who, solely\nfrom regard to the opinion of others, and without any wish or\nnecessity of his own, toils after gold, honour, or any other\nphantom, is no better than a fool.",
        "You insist so much on my not neglecting my drawing, that it would\nbe as well for me to say nothing as to confess how little I have\nlately done.",
        "I never felt happier, I never understood nature better, even down\nto the veriest stem or smallest blade of grass ; and yet I am\nunable to express myself: my powers of execution are so weak,\neverything seems to swim and float before me, so that I cannot\nmake a clear, bold outline. But I fancy I should succeed better\nif I had some clay or wax to model. I shall try, if this state\nof mind continues much longer, and will take to modelling, if I\nonly knead dough.",
        "I have commenced Charlotte’s portrait three times, and have as\noften disgraced myself. This is the more annoying, as I was\nformerly very happy in taking likenesses. I have since sketched\nher profile, and must content myself with that.",
        "Yes, dear Charlotte! I will order and arrange everything. Only\ngive me more commissions, the more the better. One thing, however,\nI must request: use no more writing-sand with the dear notes you\nsend me. Today I raised your letter hastily to my lips, and it\nset my teeth on edge.",
        "I have often determined not to see her so frequently. But who\ncould keep such a resolution? Every day I am exposed to the\ntemptation, and promise faithfully that to-morrow I will really\nstay away: but, when tomorrow comes, I find some irresistible\nreason for seeing her; and, before I can account for it, I am with\nher again. Either she has said on the previous evening “You will\nbe sure to call to-morrow,” — and who could stay away then? —or\nshe gives me some commission, and I find it essential to take\nher the answer in person; or the day is fine, and I walk to Walheim;\nand, when I am there, it is only half a league farther to her. I\nam within the charmed atmosphere, and soon find myself at her side.\nMy grandmother used to tell us a story of a mountain of loadstone.\nWhen any vessels came near it, they were instantly deprived of\ntheir ironwork: the nails flew to the mountain, and the unhappy\ncrew perished amidst the disjointed planks.",
        "Albert is arrived, and I must take my departure. Were he the best\nand noblest of men, and I in every respect his inferior, I could\nnot endure to see him in possession of such a perfect being.\nPossession! — enough, Wilhelm: her betrothed is here, — a fine,\nworthy fellow, whom one cannot help liking. Fortunately I was not\npresent at their meeting. It would have broken my heart! And he\nis so considerate: he has not given Charlotte one kiss in my\npresence. Heaven reward him for it! I must love him for the\nrespect with which he treats her. He shows a regard for me, but\nfor this I suspect I am more indebted to Charlotte than to his own\nfancy for me. Women have a delicate tact in such matters, and it\nshould be so. They cannot always succeed in keeping two rivals\non terms with each other; but, when they do, they are the only\ngainers.",
        "I cannot help esteeming Albert. The coolness of his temper contrasts\nstrongly with the impetuosity of mine, which I cannot conceal.\nHe has a great deal of feeling, and is fully sensible of the\ntreasure he possesses in Charlotte. He is free from ill-humour,\nwhich you know is the fault I detest most.",
        "He regards me as a man of sense; and my attachment to Charlotte,\nand the interest I take in all that concerns her, augment his\ntriumph and his love. I shall not inquire whether he may not at\ntimes tease her with some little jealousies; as I know, that, were\nI in his place, I should not be entirely free from such sensations.",
        "But, be that as it may, my pleasure with Charlotte is over. Call\nit folly or infatuation, what signifies a name? The thing speaks\nfor itself. Before Albert came, I knew all that I know now. I\nknew I could make no pretensions to her, nor did I offer any, that\nis, as far as it was possible, in the presence of so much loveliness,\nnot to pant for its enjoyment. And now, behold me like a silly\nfellow, staring with astonishment when another comes in, and\ndeprives me of my love.",
        "I bite my lips, and feel infinite scorn for those who tell me to\nbe resigned, because there is no help for it. Let me escape from\nthe yoke of such silly subterfuges! I ramble through the woods;\nand when I return to Charlotte, and find Albert sitting by her\nside in the summer-house in the garden, I am unable to bear it,\nbehave like a fool, and commit a thousand extravagances. “For\nHeaven’s sake,” said Charlotte today, “let us have no more scenes\nlike those of last night! You terrify me when you are so violent.\"\nBetween ourselves, I am always away now when he visits her: and I\nfeel delighted when I find her alone.",
        "Believe me, dear Wilhelm, I did not allude to you when I spoke so\nseverely of those who advise resignation to inevitable fate. I\ndid not think it possible for you to indulge such a sentiment.\nBut in fact you are right. I only suggest one objection. In this\nworld one is seldom reduced to make a selection between two\nalternatives. There are as many varieties of conduct and opinion\nas there are turns of feature between an aquiline nose and a flat\none.",
        "You will, therefore, permit me to concede your entire argument,\nand yet contrive means to escape your dilemma.",
        "Your position is this, I hear you say: “Either you have hopes of\nobtaining Charlotte, or you have none. Well, in the first case,\npursue your course, and press on to the fulfilment of your wishes.\nIn the second, be a man, and shake off a miserable passion, which\nwill enervate and destroy you.” My dear friend, this is well and\neasily said.",
        "But would you require a wretched being, whose life is slowly wasting\nunder a lingering disease, to despatch himself at once by the\nstroke of a dagger? Does not the very disorder which consumes his\nstrength deprive him of the courage to effect his deliverance?",
        "You may answer me, if you please, with a similar analogy, “Who\nwould not prefer the amputation of an arm to the periling of life\nby doubt and procrastination!” But I know not if I am right, and\nlet us leave these comparisons.",
        "Enough! There are moments, Wilhelm, when I could rise up and shake\nit all off, and when, if I only knew where to go, I could fly from\nthis place.",
        "My diary, which I have for some time neglected, came before me\ntoday; and I am amazed to see how deliberately I have entangled\nmyself step by step. To have seen my position so clearly, and\nyet to have acted so like a child! Even still I behold the\nresult plainly, and yet have no thought of acting with greater\nprudence.",
        "If I were not a fool, I could spend the happiest and most delightful\nlife here. So many agreeable circumstances, and of a kind to\nensure a worthy man’s happiness, are seldom united. Alas! I feel\nit too sensibly, — the heart alone makes our happiness! To be\nadmitted into this most charming family, to be loved by the father\nas a son, by the children as a father, and by Charlotte! then the\nnoble Albert, who never disturbs my happiness by any appearance\nof ill-humour, receiving me with the heartiest affection, and\nloving me, next to Charlotte, better than all the world! Wilhelm,\nyou would be delighted to hear us in our rambles, and conversations\nabout Charlotte. Nothing in the world can be more absurd than our\nconnection, and yet the thought of it often moves me to tears.",
        "He tells me sometimes of her excellent mother; how, upon her\ndeath-bed, she had committed her house and children to Charlotte,\nand had given Charlotte herself in charge to him; how, since that\ntime, a new spirit had taken possession of her; how, in care and\nanxiety for their welfare, she became a real mother to them; how\nevery moment of her time was devoted to some labour of love in\ntheir behalf, — and yet her mirth and cheerfulness had never\nforsaken her. I walk by his side, pluck flowers by the way, arrange\nthem carefully into a nosegay, then fling them into the first\nstream I pass, and watch them as they float gently away. I forget\nwhether I told you that Albert is to remain here. He has received\na government appointment, with a very good salary; and I understand\nhe is in high favour at court. I have met few persons so punctual\nand methodical in business.",
        "Certainly Albert is the best fellow in the world. I had a strange\nscene with him yesterday. I went to take leave of him; for I took\nit into my head to spend a few days in these mountains, from where\nI now write to you. As I was walking up and down his room, my eye\nfell upon his pistols. “Lend me those pistols,” said I, “for my\njourney.” “By all means,” he replied, “if you will take the\ntrouble to load them; for they only hang there for form.” I\ntook down one of them; and he continued, “Ever since I was near\nsuffering for my extreme caution, I will have nothing to do with\nsuch things.” I was curious to hear the story. “I was staying,\"\nsaid he, “some three months ago, at a friend’s house in the country.\nI had a brace of pistols with me, unloaded; and I slept without\nany anxiety. One rainy afternoon I was sitting by myself, doing\nnothing, when it occurred to me I do not know how that the house\nmight be attacked, that we might require the pistols, that we might\nin short, you know how we go on fancying, when we have nothing\nbetter to do. I gave the pistols to the servant, to clean and\nload. He was playing with the maid, and trying to frighten her,\nwhen the pistol went off — God knows how! — the ramrod was in\nthe barrel; and it went straight through her right hand, and\nshattered the thumb. I had to endure all the lamentation, and to\npay the surgeon’s bill; so, since that time, I have kept all my\nweapons unloaded. But, my dear friend, what is the use of prudence?\nWe can never be on our guard against all possible dangers. However,\"\n— now, you must know I can tolerate all men till they come to\n\"however;” — for it is self-evident that every universal rule\nmust have its exceptions. But he is so exceedingly accurate, that,\nif he only fancies he has said a word too precipitate, or too\ngeneral, or only half true, he never ceases to qualify, to modify,\nand extenuate, till at last he appears to have said nothing at\nall. Upon this occasion, Albert was deeply immersed in his\nsubject: I ceased to listen to him, and became lost in reverie.\nWith a sudden motion, I pointed the mouth of the pistol to my\nforehead, over the right eye. “What do vou mean?” cried Albert,\nturning back the pistol. “It is not loaded,” said I. “And even\nif not,” he answered with impatience, “what can you mean? I\ncannot cornprehend how a man can be so mad as to shoot himself,\nand the bare idea of it shocks me.”",
        "“But why should any one,” said I, “in speaking of an action, venture\nto pronounce it mad or wise, or good or bad? What is the meaning\nof all this? Have you carefully studied the secret motives of our\nactions? Do you understand — can you explain the causes which\noccasion them, and make them inevitable? If you can, you will be\nless hasty with your decision.”",
        "“But you will allow,” said Albert; “that some actions are criminal,\nlet them spring from whatever motives they may.” I granted it,\nand shrugged my shoulders.",
        "“But still, my good friend,” I continued, “there are some exceptions\nhere too. Theft is a crime; but the man who commits it from extreme\npoverty, with no design but to save his family from perishing, is\nhe an object of pity, or of punishment? Who shall throw the first\nstone at a husband, who, in the heat of just resentment, sacrifices\nhis faithless wife and her perfidious seducer? or at the young\nmaiden, who, in her weak hour of rapture, forgets herself in the\nimpetuous joys of love? Even our laws, cold and cruel as they\nare, relent in such cases, and withhold their punishment.”",
        "“That is quite another thing,” said Albert; “because a man under\nthe influence of violent passion loses alI power of reflection,\nand is regarded as intoxicated or insane.”",
        "“Oh! you people of sound understandings,” I replied, smiling, “are\never ready to exclaim ’Extravagance, and madness, and intoxication!’\nYou moral men are so calm and so subdued! You abhor the drunken\nman, and detest the extravagant; you pass by, like the Levite,\nand thank God, like the Pharisee, that you are not like one of\nthem. I have been more than once intoxicated, my passions have\nalways bordered on extravagance: I am not ashamed to confess it;\nfor I have learned, by my own experience, that all extraordinary\nmen, who have accomplished great and astonishing actions, have\never been decried by the world as drunken or insane. And in\nprivate life, too, is it not intolerable that no one can undertake\nthe execution of a noble or generous deed, without giving rise to\nthe exclamation that the doer is intoxicated or mad? Shame upon\nyou, ye sages!”",
        "“This is another of your extravagant humours,” said Albert: “you\nalways exaggerate a case, and in this matter you are undoubtedly\nwrong; for we were speaking of suicide, which you compare with\ngreat actions, when it is impossible to regard it as anything but\na weakness. It is much easier to die than to bear a life of misery\nwith fortitude.”",
        "I was on the point of breaking off the conversation, for nothing\nputs me so completely out of patience as the utterance of a wretched\ncommonplace when I am talking from my inmost heart. However, I\ncomposed myself, for I had often heard the same observation with\nsufficient vexation; and I answered him, therefore, with a little\nwarmth, “You call this a weakness — beware of being led astray\nby appearances. When a nation, which has long groaned under the\nintolerable yoke of a tyrant, rises at last and throws off its\nchains, do you call that weakness? The man who, to rescue his\nhouse from the flames, finds his physical strength redoubled, so\nthat he lifts burdens with ease, which, in the absence of excitement,\nhe could scarcely move; he who, under the rage of an insult, attacks\nand puts to flight half a score of his enemies, are such persons\nto be called weak? My good friend, if resistance be strength, how\ncan the highest degree of resistance be a weakness?”",
        "Albert looked steadfastly at me, and said, “Pray forgive me, but\nI do not see that the examples you have adduced bear any relation\nto the question.” “Very likely,” I answered; “for I have often\nbeen told that my style of illustration borders a little on the\nabsurd. But let us see if we cannot place the matter in another\npoint of view, by inquiring what can be a man’s state of mind who\nresolves to free himself from the burden of life, — a burden often\nso pleasant to bear, — for we cannot otherwise reason fairly upon\nthe subject.",
        "“Human nature,” I continued, “has its limits. It is able to endure\na certain degree of joy, sorrow, and pain, but becomes annihilated\nas soon as this measure is exceeded. The question, therefore, is,\nnot whether a man is strong or weak, but whether he is able to\nendure the measure of his sufferings. The suffering may be moral\nor physical; and in my opinion it is just as absurd to call a man\na coward who destroys himself, as to call a man a coward who dies\nof a malignant fever.”",
        "“Paradox, all paradox!” exclaimed Albert. “Not so paradoxical as\nyou imagine,” I replied. “You allow that we designate a disease\nas mortal when nature is so severely attacked, and her strength\nso far exhausted, that she cannot possibly recover her former\ncondition under any change that may take place.",
        "“Now, my good friend, apply this to the mind; observe a man in his\nnatural, isolated condition; consider how ideas work, and how\nimpressions fasten on him, till at length a violent passion seizes\nhim, destroying all his powers of calm reflection, and utterly\nruining him.",
        "“It is in vain that a man of sound mind and cool temper understands\nthe condition of such a wretched being, in vain he counsels him.\nHe can no more communicate his own wisdom to him than a healthy\nman can instil his strength into the invalid, by whose bedside he\nis seated.”",
        "Albert thought this too general. I reminded him of a girl who had\ndrowned herself a short time previously, and I related her history.",
        "She was a good creature, who had grown up in the narrow sphere of\nhousehold industry and weekly appointed labour; one who knew no\npleasure beyond indulging in a walk on Sundays, arrayed in her\nbest attire, accompanied by her friends, or perhaps joining in the\ndance now and then at some festival, and chatting away her spare\nhours with a neighbour, discussing the scandal or the quarrels of\nthe village, trifles sufficient to occupy her heart. At length\nthe warmth of her nature is influenced by certain new and unknown\nwishes. Inflamed by the flatteries of men, her former pleasures\nbecome by degrees insipid, till at length she meets with a youth\nto whom she is attracted by an indescribable feeling; upon him she\nnow rests all her hopes; she forgets the world around her; she\nsees, hears, desires nothing but him, and him only. He alone\noccupies all her thoughts. Uncorrupted by the idle indulgence of\nan enervating vanity, her affection moving steadily toward its\nobject, she hopes to become his, and to realise, in an everlasting\nunion with him, all that happiness which she sought, all that bliss\nfor which she longed. His repeated promises confirm her hopes:\nembraces and endearments, which increase the ardour of her desires,\novermaster her soul. She floats in a dim, delusive anticipation\nof her happiness; and her feelings become excited to their utmost\ntension. She stretches out her arms finally to embrace the object\nof all her wishes and her lover forsakes her. Stunned and bewildered,\nshe stands upon a precipice. All is darkness around her. No\nprospect, no hope, no consolation — forsaken by him in whom her\nexistence was centred! She sees nothing of the wide world before\nher, thinks nothing of the many individuals who might supply the\nvoid in her heart; she feels herself deserted, forsaken by the\nworld; and, blinded and impelled by the agony which wrings her\nsoul, she plunges into the deep, to end her sufferings in the broad\nembrace of death. See here, Albert, the history of thousands; and\ntell me, is not this a case of physical infirmity? Nature has no\nway to escape from the labyrinth: her powers are exhausted: she\ncan contend no longer, and the poor soul must die.",
        "“Shame upon him who can look on calmly, and exclaim, ’The foolish\ngirl! she should have waited; she should have allowed time to wear\noff the impression; her despair would have been softened, and she\nwould have found another lover to comfort her.’ One might as well\nsay, ’The fool, to die of a fever! why did he not wait till his\nstrength was restored, till his blood became calm? all would then\nhave gone well, and he would have been alive now.’”",
        "Albert, who could not see the justice of the comparison, offered\nsome further objections, and, amongst others, urged that I had\ntaken the case of a mere ignorant girl. But how any man of sense,\nof more enlarged views and experience, could be excused, he was\nunable to comprehend. “My friend!” I exclaimed, “man is but man;\nand, whatever be the extent of his reasoning powers, they are of\nlittle avail when passion rages within, and he feels himself\nconfined by the narrow limits of nature. It were better, then —\nbut we will talk of this some other time,” I said, and caught up\nmy hat. Alas! my heart was full; and we parted without conviction\non either side. How rarely in this world do men understand each\nother!",
        "There can be no doubt that in this world nothing is so indispensable\nas love. I observe that Charlotte could not lose me without a\npang, and the very children have but one wish; that is, that I\nshould visit them again to-morrow. I went this afternoon to tune\nCharlotte’s piano. But I could not do it, for the little ones\ninsisted on my telling them a story; and Charlotte herself urged\nme to satisfy them. I waited upon them at tea, and they are now\nas fully contented with me as with Charlotte; and I told them my\nvery best tale of the princess who was waited upon by dwarfs.\nI improve myself by this exercise, and am quite surprised at the\nimpression my stories create. If I sometimes invent an incident\nwhich I forget upon the next narration, they remind one directly\nthat the story was different before; so that I now endeavour to\nrelate with exactness the same anecdote in the same monotonous\ntone, which never changes. I find by this, how much an author\ninjures his works by altering them, even though they be improved\nin a poetical point of view. The first impression is readily\nreceived. We are so constituted that we believe the most incredible\nthings; and, once they are engraved upon the memory, woe to him\nwho would endeavour to efface them.",
        "Must it ever be thus, — that the source of our happiness must\nalso be the fountain of our misery? The full and ardent sentiment\nwhich animated my heart with the love of nature, overwhelming me\nwith a torrent of delight, and which brought all paradise before\nme, has now become an insupportable torment, a demon which perpetually\npursues and harasses me. When in bygone days I gazed from these\nrocks upon yonder mountains across the river, and upon the green,\nflowery valley before me, and saw alI nature budding and bursting\naround; the hills clothed from foot to peak with tall, thick forest\ntrees; the valleys in all their varied windings, shaded with the\nloveliest woods; and the soft river gliding along amongst the\nlisping reeds, mirroring the beautiful clouds which the soft evening\nbreeze wafted across the sky, — when I heard the groves about me\nmelodious with the music of birds, and saw the million swarms of\ninsects dancing in the last golden beams of the sun, whose setting\nrays awoke the humming beetles from their grassy beds, whilst the\nsubdued tumult around directed my attention to the ground, and I\nthere observed the arid rock compelled to yield nutriment to the\ndry moss, whilst the heath flourished upon the barren sands below\nme, all this displayed to me the inner warmth which animates all\nnature, and filled and glowed within my heart. I felt myself\nexalted by this overflowing fulness to the perception of the\nGodhead, and the glorious forms of an infinite universe became\nvisible to my soul! Stupendous mountains encompassed me, abysses\nyawned at my feet, and cataracts fell headlong down before me;\nimpetuous rivers rolled through the plain, and rocks and mountains\nresounded from afar. In the depths of the earth I saw innumerable\npowers in motion, and multiplying to infinity; whilst upon its\nsurface, and beneath the heavens, there teemed ten thousand varieties\nof living creatures. Everything around is alive with an infinite\nnumber of forms; while mankind fly for security to their petty\nhouses, from the shelter of which they rule in their imaginations\nover the wide-extended universe. Poor fool! in whose petty\nestimation all things are little. From the inaccessible mountains,\nacross the desert which no mortal foot has trod, far as the confines\nof the unknown ocean, breathes the spirit of the eternal Creator;\nand every atom to which he has given existence finds favour in his\nsight. Ah, how often at that time has the flight of a bird, soaring\nabove my head, inspired me with the desire of being transported\nto the shores of the immeasurable waters, there to quaff the\npleasures of life from the foaming goblet of the Infinite, and to\npartake, if but for a moment even, with the confined powers of my\nsoul, the beatitude of that Creator who accomplishes all things\nin himself, and through himself!",
        "My dear friend, the bare recollection of those hours still consoles\nme. Even this effort to recall those ineffable sensations, and\ngive them utterance, exalts my soul above itself, and makes me\ndoubly feel the intensity of my present anguish.",
        "It is as if a curtain had been drawn from before my eyes, and,\ninstead of prospects of eternal life, the abyss of an ever open\ngrave yawned before me. Can we say of anything that it exists\nwhen all passes away, when time, with the speed of a storm, carries\nall things onward, — and our transitory existence, hurried along\nby the torrent, is either swallowed up by the waves or dashed\nagainst the rocks? There is not a moment but preys upon you, —\nand upon all around you, not a moment in which you do not yourself\nbecome a destroyer. The most innocent walk deprives of life\nthousands of poor insects: one step destroys the fabric of the\nindustrious ant, and converts a little world into chaos. No: it\nis not the great and rare calamities of the world, the floods which\nsweep away whole villages, the earthquakes which swallow up our\ntowns, that affect me. My heart is wasted by the thought of that\ndestructive power which lies concealed in every part of universal\nnature. Nature has formed nothing that does not consume itself,\nand every object near it: so that, surrounded by earth and air,\nand all the active powers, I wander on my way with aching heart;\nand the universe is to me a fearful monster, for ever devouring\nits own offspring.",
        "In vain do I stretch out my arms toward her when I awaken in the\nmorning from my weary slumbers. In vain do I seek for her at night\nin my bed, when some innocent dream has happily deceived me, and\nplaced her near me in the fields, when I have seized her hand and\ncovered it with countless kisses. And when I feel for her in the\nhalf confusion of sleep, with the happy sense that she is near,\ntears flow from my oppressed heart; and, bereft of all comfort, I\nweep over my future woes.",
        "What a misfortune, Wilhelm! My active spirits have degenerated\ninto contented indolence. I cannot be idle, and yet I am unable\nto set to work. I cannot think: I have no longer any feeling for\nthe beauties of nature, and books are distasteful to me. Once we\ngive ourselves up, we are totally lost. Many a time and oft I\nwish I were a common labourer; that, awakening in the morning, I\nmight have but one prospect, one pursuit, one hope, for the day\nwhich has dawned. I often envy Albert when I see him buried in a\nheap of papers and parchments, and I fancy I should be happy were\nI in his place. Often impressed with this feeling I have been on\nthe point of writing to you and to the minister, for the appointment\nat the embassy, which you think I might obtain. I believe I might\nprocure it. The minister has long shown a regard for me, and has\nfrequently urged me to seek employment. It is the business of an\nhour only. Now and then the fable of the horse recurs to me. \nWeary of liberty, he suffered himself to be saddled and bridled,\nand was ridden to death for his pains. I know not what to determine\nupon. For is not this anxiety for change the consequence of that\nrestless spirit which would pursue me equally in every situation\nof life?",
        "If my ills would admit of any cure, they would certainly be cured\nhere. This is my birthday, and early in the morning I received a\npacket from Albert. Upon opening it, I found one of the pink\nribbons which Charlotte wore in her dress the first time I saw her,\nand which I had several times asked her to give me. With it were\ntwo volumes in duodecimo of Wetstein’s “Homer,” a book I had often\nwished for, to save me the inconvenience of carrying the large\nErnestine edition with me upon my walks. You see how they anticipate\nmy wishes, how well they understand all those little attentions\nof friendship, so superior to the costly presents of the great,\nwhich are humiliating. I kissed the ribbon a thousand times, and\nin every breath inhaled the remembrance of those happy and irrevocable\ndays which filled me with the keenest joy. Such, Wilhelm, is our\nfate. I do not murmur at it: the flowers of life are but visionary. \nHow many pass away, and leave no trace behind — how few yield any\nfruit — and the fruit itself, how rarely does it ripen! And yet\nthere are flowers enough! and is it not strange, my friend, that\nwe should suffer the little that does really ripen, to rot, decay,\nand perish unenjoyed?",
        "Farewell! This is a glorious summer. I\noften climb into the trees in Charlotte’s orchard, and shake down\nthe pears that hang on the highest branches. She stands below,\nand catches them as they fall.",
        "Unhappy being that I am! Why do I thus deceive myself? What is\nto come of all this wild, aimless, endless passion? I cannot pray\nexcept to her. My imagination sees nothing but her: all surrounding\nobjects are of no account, except as they relate to her. In this\ndreamy state I enjoy many happy hours, till at length I feel\ncompelled to tear myself away from her. Ah, Wilhelm, to what\ndoes not my heart often compel me! When I have spent several hours\nin her company, till I feel completely absorbed by her figure, her\ngrace, the divine expression of her thoughts, my mind becomes\ngradually excited to the highest excess, my sight grows dim, my\nhearing confused, my breathing oppressed as if by the hand of a\nmurderer, and my beating heart seeks to obtain relief for my aching\nsenses. I am sometimes unconscious whether I really exist. If\nin such moments I find no sympathy, and Charlotte does not allow\nme to enjoy the melancholy consolation of bathing her hand with\nmy tears, I feel compelled to tear myself from her, when I either\nwander through the country, climb some precipitous cliff, or force\na path through the trackless thicket, where I am lacerated and\ntorn by thorns and briers; and thence I find relief. Sometimes I\nlie stretched on the ground, overcome with fatigue and dying with\nthirst; sometimes, late in the night, when the moon shines above\nme, I recline against an aged tree in some sequestered forest, to\nrest my weary limbs, when, exhausted and worn, I sleep till break\nof day. O Wilhelm! the hermit’s cell, his sackcloth, and girdle\nof thorns would be luxury and indulgence compared with what I suffer.\nAdieu! I see no end to this wretchedness except the grave.",
        "I must away. Thank you, Wilhelm, for determining my wavering\npurpose. For a whole fortnight I have thought of leaving her. I\nmust away. She has returned to town, and is at the house of a\nfriend. And then, Albert — yes, I must go.",
        "Oh, what a night, Wilhelm! I can henceforth bear anything. I\nshall never see her again. Oh, why cannot I fall on your neck,\nand, with floods of tears and raptures, give utterance to all the\npassions which distract my heart! Here I sit gasping for breath,\nand struggling to compose myself. I wait for day, and at sunrise\nthe horses are to be at the door.",
        "And she is sleeping calmly, little suspecting that she has seen me\nfor the last time. I am free. I have had the courage, in an\ninterview of two hours’ duration, not to betray my intention. And\nO Wilhelm, what a conversation it was!",
        "Albert had promised to come to Charlotte in the garden immediately\nafter supper. I was upon the terrace under the tall chestnut trees,\nand watched the setting sun. I saw him sink for the last time\nbeneath this delightful valley and silent stream. I had often\nvisited the same spot with Charlotte, and witnessed that glorious\nsight; and now — I was walking up and down the very avenue which\nwas so dear to me. A secret sympathy had frequently drawn me\nthither before I knew Charlotte; and we were delighted when, in\nour early acquaintance, we discovered that we each loved the same\nspot, which is indeed as romantic as any that ever captivated the\nfancy of an artist.",
        ">From beneath the chestnut trees, there is an extensive view. But\nI remember that I have mentioned all this in a former letter, and\nhave described the tall mass of beech trees at the end, and how\nthe avenue grows darker and darker as it winds its way among them,\ntill it ends in a gloomy recess, which has all the charm of a\nmysterious solitude. I still remember the strange feeling of\nmelancholy which came over me the first time I entered that dark\nretreat, at bright midday. I felt some secret foreboding that it\nwould, one day, be to me the scene of some happiness or misery.",
        "I had spent half an hour struggling between the contending thoughts\nof going and returning, when I heard them coming up the terrace.\nI ran to meet them. I trembled as I took her hand, and kissed it.\nAs we reached the top of the terrace, the moon rose from behind\nthe wooded hill. We conversed on many subjects, and, without\nperceiving it, approached the gloomy recess. Charlotte entered,\nand sat down. Albert seated himself beside her. I did the same,\nbut my agitation did not suffer me to remain long seated. I got\nup, and stood before her, then walked backward and forward, and\nsat down again. I was restless and miserable. Charlotte drew our\nattention to the beautiful effect of the moonlight, which threw a\nsilver hue over the terrace in front of us, beyond the beech trees.\nIt was a glorious sight, and was rendered more striking by the\ndarkness which surrounded the spot where we were. We remained for\nsome time silent, when Charlotte observed, “Whenever I walk by\nmoonlight, it brings to my remembrance all my beloved and departed\nfriends, and I am filled with thoughts of death and futurity. We\nshall live again, Werther!” she continued, with a firm but feeling\nvoice; “but shall we know one another again what do you think?\nwhat do you say?”",
        "“Charlotte,” I said, as I took her hand in mine, and my eyes filled\nwith tears, “we shall see each other again — here and hereafter\nwe shall meet again.” I could say no more. Why, Wilhelm, should\nshe put this question to me, just at the monent when the fear of\nour cruel separation filled my heart?",
        "“And oh! do those departed ones know how we are employed here? do\nthey know when we are well and happy? do they know when we recall\ntheir memories with the fondest love? In the silent hour of\nevening the shade of my mother hovers around me; when seated\nin the midst of my children, I see them assembled near me, as\nthey used to assemble near her; and then I raise my anxious eyes\nto heaven, and wish she could look down upon us, and witness how\nI fulfil the promise I made to her in her last moments, to be a\nmother to her children. With what emotion do I then exclaim,\n’Pardon, dearest of mothers, pardon me, if I do not adequately\nsupply your place! Alas! I do my utmost. They are clothed and\nfed; and, still better, they are loved and educated. Could you\nbut see, sweet saint! the peace and harmony that dwells amongst\nus, you would glorify God with the warmest feelings of gratitude,\nto whom, in your last hour, you addressed such fervent prayers for\nour happiness.’” Thus did she express herself; but O Wilhelm! who\ncan do justice to her language? how can cold and passionless words\nconvey the heavenly expressions of the spirit? Albert interrupted\nher gently. “This affects you too deeply, my dear Charlotte. I\nknow your soul dwells on such recollections wlth intense delight;\nbut I implore — “ “O Albert!” she continued, “I am sure you do\nnot forget the evenings when we three used to sit at the little\nround table, when papa was absent, and the little ones had retired.\nYou often had a good book with you, but seldom read it; the\nconversation of that noble being was preferable to everything, —\nthat beautiful, bright, gentle, and yet ever-toiling woman. God\nalone knows how I have supplicated with tears on my nightly couch,\nthat I might be like her.”",
        "I threw myself at her feet, and, seizing her hand, bedewed it with\na thousand tears. “Charlotte!” I exclaimed, “God’s blessing and\nyour mother’s spirit are upon you.” “Oh! that you had known her,\"\nshe said, with a warm pressure of the hand. “She was worthy of\nbeing known to you.” I thought I should have fainted: never had\nI received praise so flattering. She continued, “And yet she was\ndoomed to die in the flower of her youth, when her youngest child\nwas scarcely six months old. Her illness was but short, but she\nwas calm and resigned; and it was only for her children, especially\nthe youngest, that she felt unhappy. When her end drew nigh, she\nbade me bring them to her. I obeyed. The younger ones knew nothing\nof their approaching loss, while the elder ones were quite overcome\nwith grief. They stood around the bed; and she raised her feeble\nhands to heaven, and prayed over them; then, kissing them in turn,\nshe dismissed them, and said to me, ’Be you a mother to them.’ I\ngave her my hand. ’You are promising much, my child,’ she said:\n’a mother’s fondness and a mother’s care! I have often witnessed,\nby your tears of gratitude, that you know what is a mother’s\ntenderness: show it to your brothers and sisters, and be dutiful\nand faithful to your father as a wife; you will be his comfort.’\nShe inquired for him. He had retired to conceal his intolerable\nanguish, — he was heartbroken, “Albert, you were in the room.\nShe heard some one moving: she inquired who it was, and desired\nyou to approach. She surveyed us both with a look of composure\nand satisfaction, expressive of her conviction that we should be\nhappy, — happy with one another.” Albert fell upon her neck, and\nkissed her, and exclaimed, “We are so, and we shall be so!” Even\nAlbert, generally so tranquil, had quite lost his composure; and\nI was excited beyond expression.",
        "“And such a being,” She continued, “was to leave us, Werther!\nGreat God, must we thus part with everything we hold dear in this\nworld? Nobody felt this more acutely than the children: they cried\nand lamented for a long time afterward, complaining that men had\ncarried away their dear mamma.”",
        "Charlotte rose. It aroused me; but I continued sitting, and held\nher hand. “Let us go,” she said: “it grows late.” She attempted\nto withdraw her hand: I held it still. “We shall see each other\nagain,” I exclaimed: “we shall recognise each other under every\npossible change! I am going,” I continued, “going willingly; but,\nshould I say for ever, perhaps I may not keep my word. Adieu,\nCharlotte; adieu, Albert. We shall meet again.” “Yes: tomorrow,\nI think,” she answered with a smile. Tomorrow! how I felt the word!\nAh! she little thought, when she drew her hand away from mine.\nThey walked down the avenue. I stood gazing after them in the\nmoonlight. I threw myself upon the ground, and wept: I then sprang\nup, and ran out upon the terrace, and saw, under the shade of the\nlinden-trees, her white dress disappearing near the garden-gate.\nI stretched out my arms, and she vanished.",
        "\nOctober 2O.\nWe arrived here yesterday. The ambassador is indisposed, and will\nnot go out for some days. If he were less peevish and morose, all\nwould be well. I see but too plainly that Heaven has destined me\nto severe trials; but courage! a light heart may bear anything.\nA light heart! I smile to find such a word proceeding from my pen.\nA little more lightheartedness would render me the happiest being\nunder the sun. But must I despair of my talents and faculties,\nwhilst others of far inferior abilities parade before me with the\nutmost self-satisfaction? Gracious Providence, to whom I owe all\nmy powers, why didst thou not withhold some of those blessings I\npossess, and substitute in their place a feeling of self-confidence\nand contentment?\nBut patience! all will yet be well; for I assure you, my dear\nfriend, you were right: since I have been obliged to associate\ncontinually with other people, and observe what they do, and how\nthey employ themselves, I have become far better satisfied with\nmyself. For we are so constituted by nature, that we are ever\nprone to compare ourselves with others; and our happiness or misery\ndepends very much on the objects and persons around us. On this\naccount, nothing is more dangerous than solitude: there our\nimagination, always disposed to rise, taking a new flight on the\nwings of fancy, pictures to us a chain of beings of whom we seem\nthe most inferior. All things appear greater than they really\nare, and all seem superior to us. This operation of the mind is\nquite natural: we so continually feel our own imperfections, and\nfancy we perceive in others the qualities we do not possess,\nattributing to them also all that we enjoy ourselves, that by this\nprocess we form the idea of a perfect, happy man, — a man, however,\nwho only exists in our own imagination.\nBut when, in spite of weakness and disappointments, we set to work\nin earnest, and persevere steadily, we often find, that, though\nobliged continually to tack, we make more way than others who have\nthe assistance of wind and tide; and, in truth, there can be no\ngreater satisfaction than to keep pace with others or outstrip\nthem in the race.\nNovember 26.\nI begin to find my situation here more tolerable, considering all\ncircumstances. I find a great advantage in being much occupied;\nand the number of persons I meet, and their different pursuits,\ncreate a varied entertainment for me. I have formed the acquaintance\nof the Count C— and I esteem him more and more every day. He is\na man of strong understanding and great discernment; but, though\nhe sees farther than other people, he is not on that account cold\nin his manner, but capable of inspiring and returning the warmest\naffection. He appeared interested in me on one occasion, when I\nhad to transact some business with him. He perceived, at the first\nword, that we understood each other, and that he could converse\nwith me in a different tone from what he used with others. I\ncannot sufficiently esteem his frank and open kindness to me. It\nis the greatest and most genuine of pleasures to observe a great\nmind in sympathy with our own.\nDecember 24.\nAs I anticipated, the ambassador occasions me infinite annoyance.\nHe is the most punctilious blockhead under heaven. He does\neverything step by step, with the trifling minuteness of an old\nwoman; and he is a man whom it is impossible to please, because\nhe is never pleased with himself. I like to do business regularly\nand cheerfully, and, when it is finished, to leave it. But he\nconstantly returns my papers to me, saying, “They will do,” but\nrecommending me to look over them again, as “one may always improve\nby using a better word or a more appropriate particle.” I then\nlose all patience, and wish myself at the devil’s. Not a conjunction,\nnot an adverb, must be omitted: he has a deadly antipathy to all\nthose transpositions of which I am so fond; and, if the music of\nour periods is not tuned to the established, official key, he\ncannot comprehend our meaning. It is deplorable to be connected\nwith such a fellow.\nMy acquaintance with the Count C— is the only compensation for\nsuch an evil. He told me frankly, the other day, that he was much\ndispleased with the difficulties and delays of the ambassador;\nthat people like him are obstacles, both to themselves and to\nothers. “But,” added he, “one must submit, like a traveller who\nhas to ascend a mountain: if the mountain was not there, the road\nwould be both shorter and pleasanter; but there it is, and he must\nget over it.\"\n \nThe old man perceives the count’s partiality for me: this annoys\nhim, and, he seizes every opportunity to depreciate the count in\nmy hearing. I naturally defend him, and that only makes matters\nworse. Yesterday he made me indignant, for he also alluded to me.\n\"The count,” he said, “is a man of the world, and a good man of\nbusiness: his style is good, and he writes with facility; but,\nlike other geniuses, he has no solid learning.” He looked at me\nwith an expression that seemed to ask if I felt the blow. But it\ndid not produce the desired effect: I despise a man who can think\nand act in such a manner. However, I made a stand, and answered\nwith not a little warmth. The count, I said, was a man entitled\nto respect, alike for his character and his acquirements. I had\nnever met a person whose mind was stored with more useful and\nextensive knowledge, — who had, in fact, mastered such an infinite\nvariety of subjects, and who yet retained all his activity for the\ndetails of ordinary business. This was altogether beyond his\ncomprehension; and I took my leave, lest my anger should be too\nhighly excited by some new absurdity of his.\nAnd you are to blame for all this, you who persuaded me to bend\nmy neck to this yoke by preaching a life of activity to me. If\nthe man who plants vegetables, and carries his corn to town on\nmarket-days, is not more usefully employed than I am, then let me\nwork ten years longer at the galleys to which I am now chained.\nOh, the brilliant wretchedness, the weariness, that one is doomed\nto witness among the silly people whom we meet in society here!\nThe ambition of rank! How they watch, how they toil, to gain\nprecedence! What poor and contemptible passions are displayed in\ntheir utter nakedness! We have a woman here, for example, who\nnever ceases to entertain the company with accounts of her family\nand her estates. Any stranger would consider her a silly being,\nwhose head was turned by her pretensions to rank and property; but\nshe is in reality even more ridiculous, the daughter of a mere\nmagistrate’s clerk from this neighbourhood. I cannot understand\nhow human beings can so debase themselves.\nEvery day I observe more and more the folly of judging of others\nby ourselves; and I have so much trouble with myseif, and my own\nheart is in such constant agitation, that I am well content to let\nothers pursue their own course, if they only allow me the same\nprivilege.\nWhat provokes me most is the unhappy extent to which distinctions\nof rank are carried. I know perfectly well how necessary are\ninequalities of condition, and I am sensible of the advantages I\nmyself derive therefrom; but I would not have these institutions\nprove a barrier to the small chance of happiness which I may enjoy\non this earth.\nI have lately become acquainted with a Miss B—, a very agreeable\ngirl, who has retained her natural manners in the midst of artificial\nlife. Our first conversation pleased us both equally; and, at\ntaking leave, I requested permission to visit her. She consented\nin so obliging a manner, that I waited with impatience for the\narrival of the happy moment. She is not a native of this place,\nbut resides here with her aunt. The countenance of the old lady\nis not prepossessing. I paid her much attention, addressing the\ngreater part of my conversation to her; and, in less than half an\nhour, I discovered what her niece subsequently acknowledged to me,\nthat her aged aunt, having but a small fortune, and a still smaller\nshare of understanding, enjoys no satisfaction except in the\npedigree of her ancestors, no protection save in her noble birth,\nand no enjoyment but in looking from her castle over the heads of\nthe humble citizens. She was, no doubt, handsome in her youth,\nand in her early years probably trifled away her time in rendering\nmany a poor youth the sport of her caprice: in her riper years she\nhas submitted to the yoke of a veteran officer, who, in return for\nher person and her small independence, has spent with her what we\nmay designate her age of brass. He is dead; and she is now a\nwidow, and deserted. She spends her iron age alone, and would not\nbe approached, except for the loveliness of her niece.\nJanuary 8, 1772.\nWhat beings are men, whose whole thoughts are occupied with form\nand ceremony, who for years together devote their mental and\nphysical exertions to the task of advancing themselves but one\nstep, and endeavouring to occupy a higher place at the table. Not\nthat such persons would otherwise want employment: on the contrary,\nthey give themselves much trouble by neglecting important business\nfor such petty trifles. Last week a question of precedence arose\nat a sledging-party, and all our amusement was spoiled.\nThe silly creatures cannot see that it is not place which constitutes\nreal greatness, since the man who occupies the first place but\nseldom plays the principal part. How many kings are governed by\ntheir ministers — how many ministers by their secretaries? Who, in\nsuch cases, is really the chief? He, as it seems to me, who can\nsee through the others, and possesses strength or skill enough to\nmake their power or passions subservient to the execution of his\nown designs.\nJanuary 20.\nI must write to you from this place, my dear Charlotte, from a\nsmall room in a country inn, where I have taken shelter from a\nsevere storm. During my whole residence in that wretched place\nD—, where I lived amongst strangers, — strangers, indeed, to\nthis heart, — I never at any time felt the smallest inclination\nto correspond with you; but in this cottage, in this retirement,\nin this solitude, with the snow and hail beating against my\nlattice-pane, you are my first thought. The instant I entered,\nyour figure rose up before me, and the remembrance! O my Charlotte,\nthe sacred, tender remembrance! Gracious Heaven! restore to me\nthe happy moment of our first acquaintance.\nCould you but see me, my dear Charlotte, in the whirl of\ndissipation, — how my senses are dried up, but my heart is at no\ntime full. I enjoy no single moment of happiness: all is vain —\nnothing touches me. I stand, as it were, before the raree-show:\nI see the little puppets move, and I ask whether it is not an\noptical illusion. I am amused with these puppets, or, rather, I\nam myself one of them: but, when I sometimes grasp my neighbour’s\nhand, I feel that it is not natural; and I withdraw mine with a\nshudder. In the evening I say I will enjoy the next morning’s\nsunrise, and yet I remain in bed: in the day I promise to ramble\nby moonlight; and I, nevertheless, remain at home. I know not why\nI rise, nor why I go to sleep.\nThe leaven which animated my existence is gone: the charm which\ncheered me in the gloom of night, and aroused me from my morning\nslumbers, is for ever fled.\nI have found but one being here to interest me, a Miss B—. She\nresembles you, my dear Charlotte, if any one can possibly resemble\nyou. “Ah!” you will say, “he has learned how to pay fine compliments.\"\nAnd this is partly true. I have been very agreeable lately, as\nit was not in my power to be otherwise. I have, moreover, a deal\nof wit: and the ladies say that no one understands flattery better,\nor falsehoods you will add; since the one accomplishment invariably\naccompanies the other. But I must tell you of Miss B—. She has\nabundance of soul, which flashes from her deep blue eyes. Her\nrank is a torment to her, and satisfies no one desire of her heart.\nShe would gladly retire from this whirl of fashion, and we often\npicture to ourselves a life of undisturbed happiness in distant\nscenes of rural retirement: and then we speak of you, my dear\nCharlotte; for she knows you, and renders homage to your merits;\nbut her homage is not exacted, but voluntary, she loves you, and\ndelights to hear you made the subject of conversation.\nOh, that I were sitting at your feet in your favourite little room,\nwith the dear children playing around us! If they became troublesome\nto you, I would tell them some appalling goblin story; and they\nwould crowd round me with silent attention. The sun is setting\nin glory; his last rays are shining on the snow, which covers the\nface of the country: the storm is over, and I must return to my\ndungeon. Adieu!— Is Albert with you? and what is he to you? God\nforgive the question.\nFebruary 8.\nFor a week past we have had the most wretched weather: but this\nto me is a blessing; for, during my residence here, not a single\nfine day has beamed from the heavens, but has been lost to me by\nthe intrusion of somebody. During the severity of rain, sleet,\nfrost, and storm, I congratulate myself that it cannot be worse\nindoors than abroad, nor worse abroad than it is within doors; and\nso I become reconciled. When the sun rises bright in the morning,\nand promises a glorious day, I never omit to exclaim, “There, now,\nthey have another blessing from Heaven, which they will be sure\nto destroy: they spoil everything, — health, fame, happiness,\namusement; and they do this generally through folly, ignorance,\nor imbecility, and always, according to their own account, with\nthe best intentions!” I could often beseech them, on my bended\nknees, to be less resolved upon their own destruction.\nFebruary 17.\nI fear that my ambassador and I shall not continue much longer\ntogether. He is really growing past endurance. He transacts\nhis business in so ridiculous a manner, that I am often compelled\nto contradict him, and do things my own way; and then, of course,\nhe thinks them very ill done. He complained of me lately on this\naccount at court; and the minister gave me a reprimand, — a\ngentle one it is true, but still a reprimand. In consequence of\nthis, I was about to tender my resignation, when I received a\nletter, to which I submitted with great respect, on account of the\nhigh, noble, and generous spirit which dictated it. He endeavoured\nto soothe my excessive sensibility, paid a tribute to my extreme\nideas of duty, of good example, and of perseverance in business,\nas the fruit of my youthful ardour, an impulse which he did not\nseek to destroy, but only to moderate, that it might have proper\nplay and be productive of good. So now I am at rest for another\nweek, and no longer at variance with myself. Content and peace\nof mind are valuable things: I could wish, my dear friend, that\nthese precious jewels were less transitory. \nFebruary 20.\nGod bless you, my dear friends, and may he grant you that happiness\nwhich he denies to me!\nI thank you, Albert, for having deceived me. I waited for the\nnews that your wedding-day was fixed; and I intended on that day,\nwith solemnity, to take down Charlotte’s profile from the wall,\nand to bury it with some other papers I possess. You are now\nunited, and her picture still remains here. Well, let it remain!\nWhy should it not? I know that I am still one of your society,\nthat I still occupy a place uninjured in Charlotte’s heart, that\nI hold the second place therein; and I intend to keep it. Oh, I\nshould become mad if she could forget! Albert, that thought is\nhell! Farewell, Albert farewell, angel of heaven farewell, Charlotte!\nMarch 15.\nI have just had a sad adventure, which will drive me away from\nhere. I lose all patience! — Death! — It is not to be remedied;\nand you alone are to blame, for you urged and impelled me to fill\na post for which I was by no means suited. I have now reason to\nbe satisfied, and so have you! But, that you may not again attribute\nthis fatality to my impetuous temper, I send you, my dear sir, a\nplain and simple narration of the affair, as a mere chronicler of\nfacts would describe it.\nThe Count of O— likes and distinguishes me. It is well known,\nand I have mentioned this to you a hundred times. Yesterday I\ndined with him. It is the day on which the nobility are accustomed\nto assemble at his house in the evening. I never once thought of\nthe assembly, nor that we subalterns did not belong to such society.\nWell, I dined with the count; and, after dinner, we adjourned to\nthe large hall. We walked up and down together: and I conversed\nwith him, and with Colonel B—, who joined us; and in this manner\nthe hour for the assembly approached. God knows, I was thinking\nof nothing, when who should enter but the honourable Lady accompanied\nby her noble husband and their silly, scheming daughter, with her\nsmall waist and flat neck; and, with disdainful looks and a haughty\nair they passed me by. As I heartily detest the whole race, I\ndetermined upon going away; and only waited till the count had\ndisengaged himself from their impertinent prattle, to take leave,\nwhen the agreeable Miss B— came in. As I never meet her without\nexperiencing a heartfelt pleasure, I stayed and talked to her,\nleaning over the back of her chair, and did not perceive, till\nafter some time, that she seemed a little confused, and ceased to\nanswer me with her usual ease of manner. I was struck with it.\n\"Heavens!” I said to myself, “can she, too, be like the rest?” I\nfelt annoyed, and was about to withdraw; but I remained,\nnotwithstanding, forming excuses for her conduct, fancying she did\nnot mean it, and still hoping to receive some friendly recognition.\nThe rest of the company now arrived. There was the Baron F —, in\nan entire suit that dated from the coronation of Francis I.; the\nChancellor N—, with his deaf wife; the shabbily-dressed I—, whose\nold-fashioned coat bore evidence of modern repairs: this crowned\nthe whole. I conversed with some of my acquaintances, but they\nanswered me laconically. I was engaged in observing Miss B—, and\ndid not notice that the women were whispering at the end of the\nroom, that the murmur extended by degrees to the men, that Madame\nS— addressed the count with much warmth (this was all related to\nme subsequently by Miss B—); till at length the count came up to\nme, and took me to the window. “You know our ridiculous customs,\"\nhe said. “I perceive the company is rather displeased at your\nbeing here. I would not on any account—” “I beg your excellency’s\npardon!” I exclaimed. “I ought to have thought of this before,\nbut I know you will forgive this little inattention. I was going,\"\nI added, “some time ago, but my evil genius detained me.” And I\nsmiled and bowed, to take my leave. He shook me by the hand, in\na manner which expressed everything. I hastened at once from the\nillustrious assembly, sprang into a carriage, and drove to M—.\nI contemplated the setting sun from the top of the hill, and read\nthat beautiful passage in Homer, where Ulysses is entertained by\nthe hospitable herdsmen. This was indeed delightful.\nI returned home to supper in the evening. But few persons were\nassembled in the room. They had turned up a corner of the table-cloth,\nand were playing at dice. The good-natured A— came in. He laid\ndown his hat when he saw me, approached me, and said in a low tone,\n\"You have met with a disagreeable adventure.” “I!” I exclaimed.\n\"The count obliged you to withdraw from the assembly!” “Deuce\ntake the assembly!” said I. “I was very glad to be gone.” “I am\ndelighted,” he added, “that you take it so lightly. I am only\nsorry that it is already so much spoken of.” The circumstance\nthen began to pain me. I fancied that every one who sat down, and\neven looked at me, was thinking of this incident; and my heart\nbecame embittered.\nAnd now I could plunge a dagger into my bosom, when I hear myself\neverywhere pitied, and observe the triumph of my enemies, who say\nthat this is always the case with vain persons, whose heads are\nturned with conceit, who affect to despise forms and such petty,\nidle nonsense.\nSay what you will of fortitude, but show me the man who can patiently\nendure the laughter of fools, when they have obtained an advantage\nover him. ’Tis only when their nonsense is without foundation\nthat one can suffer it without complaint.\nMarch 16. \nEverything conspires against me. I met Miss B— walking to-day.\nI could not help joining her; and, when we were at a little distance\nfrom her companions, I expressed my sense of her altered manner\ntoward me. “O Werther!” she said, in a tone of emotion, “you, who\nknow my heart, how could you so ill interpret my distress? What\ndid I not suffer for you, from the moment you entered the room!\nI foresaw it all, a hundred times was I on the point of mentioning\nit to you. I knew that the S—s and T—s, with their husbands,\nwould quit the room, rather than remain in your company. I knew\nthat the count would not break with them: and now so much is said\nabout it.” “How!” I exclaimed, and endeavoured to conceal my\nemotion; for all that Adelin had mentioned to me yesterday recurred\nto me painfully at that moment. “Oh, how much it has already cost\nme!” said this amiable girl, while her eyes filled with tears. I\ncould scarcely contain myself, and was ready to throw myself at\nher feet. “Explain yourself!” I cried. Tears flowed down her\ncheeks. I became quite frantic. She wiped them away, without\nattempting to conceal them. “You know my aunt,” she continued;\n\"she was present: and in what light does she consider the affair!\nLast night, and this morning, Werther, I was compelled to listen\nto a lecture upon my, acquaintance with you. I have been obliged\nto hear you condemned and depreciated; and I could not — I dared\nnot — say much in your defence.”\nEvery word she uttered was a dagger to my heart. She did not feel\nwhat a mercy it would have been to conceal everything from me.\nShe told me, in addition, all the impertinence that would be further\ncirculated, and how the malicious would triumph; how they would\nrejoice over the punishment of my pride, over my humiliation for\nthat want of esteem for others with which I had often been reproached.\nTo hear all this, Wilhelm, uttered by her in a voice of the most\nsincere sympathy, awakened all my passions; and I am still in a\nstate of extreme excitement. I wish I could find a man to jeer\nme about this event. I would sacrifice him to my resentment. The\nsight of his blood might possibly be a relief to my fury. A hundred\ntimes have I seized a dagger, to give ease to this oppressed heart.\nNaturalists tell of a noble race of horses that instinctively open\na vein with their teeth, when heated and exhausted by a long course,\nin order to breathe more freely. I am often tempted to open a\nvein, to procure for myself everlasting liberty.\nMarch 24.\nI have tendered my resignation to the court. I hope it will be\naccepted, and you will forgive me for not having previously consulted\nyou. It is necessary I should leave this place. I know all you\nwill urge me to stay, and therefore I beg you will soften this\nnews to my mother. I am unable to do anything for myself: how,\nthen, should I be competent to assist others? It will afflict her\nthat I should have interrupted that career which would have made\nme first a privy councillor, and then minister, and that I should\nlook behind me, in place of advancing. Argue as you will, combine\nall the reasons which should have induced me to remain, I am going:\nthat is sufficient. But, that you may not be ignorant of my\ndestination, I may mention that the Prince of — is here. He is\nmuch pleased with my company; and, having heard of my intention\nto resign, he has invited me to his country house, to pass the\nspring months with him. I shall be left completely my own master;\nand, as we agree on all subjects but one, I shall try my fortune,\nand accompany him.\nApril l9.\nThanks for both your letters. I delayed my reply, and withheld\nthis letter, till I should obtain an answer from the court. I\nfeared my mother might apply to the minister to defeat my purpose.\nBut my request is granted, my resignation is accepted. I shall\nnot recount with what reluctance it was accorded, nor relate what\nthe minister has written: you would only renew your lamentations.\nThe crown prince has sent me a present of five and twenty ducats;\nand, indeed, such goodness has affected me to tears. For this\nreason I shall not require from my mother the money for which I\nlately applied.\nMay 5.\nI leave this place to-morrow; and, as my native place is only six\nmiles from the high road, I intend to visit it once more, and\nrecall the happy dreams of my childhood. I shall enter at the\nsame gate through which I came with my mother, when, after my\nfather’s death, she left that delightful retreat to immure herself\nin your melancholy town. Adieu, my dear friend: you shall hear of\nmy future career.\nMay 9.\n\nMorning (Caspar David Friedrich)\n\nI have paid my visit to my native place with all the devotion of\na pilgrim, and have experienced many unexpected emotions. Near\nthe great elm tree, which is a quarter of a league from the village,\nI got out of the carriage, and sent it on before, that alone, and\non foot, I might enjoy vividly and heartily all the pleasure of\nmy recollections. I stood there under that same elm which was\nformerly the term and object of my walks. How things have since\nchanged! Then, in happy ignorance, I sighed for a world I did not\nknow, where I hoped to find every pleasure and enjoyment which my\nheart could desire; and now, on my return from that wide world, O\nmy friend, how many disappointed hopes and unsuccessful plans have\nI brought back!\nAs I contemplated the mountains which lay stretched out before me,\nI thought how often they had been the object of my dearest desires.\nHere used I to sit for hours together with my eyes bent upon them,\nardently longing to wander in the shade of those woods, to lose\nmyself in those valleys, which form so delightful an object in the\ndistance. With what reluctance did I leave this charming spot;\nwhen my hour of recreation was over, and my leave of absence\nexpired! I drew near to the village: all the well-known old\nsummerhouses and gardens were recognised again; I disliked the new\nones, and all other alterations which had taken place. I entered\nthe village, and all my former feelings returned. I cannot, my\ndear friend, enter into details, charming as were my sensations:\nthey would be dull in the narration. I had intended to lodge in\nthe market-place, near our old house. As soon as I entered, I\nperceived that the schoolroom, where our childhood had been taught\nby that good old woman, was converted into a shop. I called to\nmind the sorrow, the heaviness, the tears, and oppression of heart,\nwhich I experienced in that confinement. Every step produced some\nparticular impression. A pilgrim in the Holy Land does not meet\nso many spots pregnant with tender recollections, and his soul is\nhardly moved with greater devotion. One incident will serve for\nillustration. I followed the course of a stream to a farm, formerly\na delightful walk of mine, and paused at the spot, where, when\nboys, we used to amuse ourselves making ducks and drakes upon the\nwater. I recollected so well how I used formerly to watch the\ncourse of that same stream, following it with inquiring eagerness,\nforming romantic ideas of the countries it was to pass through;\nbut my imagination was soon exhausted: while the water continued\nflowing farther and farther on, till my fancy became bewildered\nby the contemplation of an invisible distance. Exactly such, my\ndear friend, so happy and so confined, were the thoughts of our\ngood ancestors. Their feelings and their poetry were fresh as\nchildhood. And, when Ulysses talks of the immeasurable sea and\nboundless earth, his epithets are true, natural, deeply felt, and\nmysterious. Of what importance is it that I have learned, with\nevery schoolboy, that the world is round? Man needs but little\nearth for enjoyment, and still less for his final repose.\nI am at present with the prince at his hunting lodge. He is a man\nwith whom one can live happily. He is honest and unaffected. There\nare, however, some strange characters about him, whom I cannot at\nall understand. They do not seem vicious, and yet they do not\ncarry the appearance of thoroughly honest men. Sometimes I am\ndisposed to believe them honest, and yet I cannot persuade myself\nto confide in them. It grieves me to hear the prince occasionally\ntalk of things which he has only read or heard of, and always with\nthe same view in which they have been represented by others.\nHe values my understanding and talents more highly than my heart,\nbut I am proud of the latter only. It is the sole source of\neverything of our strength, happiness, and misery. All the knowledge\nI possess every one else can acquire, but my heart is exclusively\nmy own.\nMay 25.\nI have had a plan in my head of which I did not intend to speak\nto you until it was accomplished: now that it has failed, I may\nas well mention it. I wished to enter the army, and had long been\ndesirous of taking the step. This, indeed, was the chief reason\nfor my coming here with the prince, as he is a general in the\nservice. I communicated my design to him during one of our walks\ntogether. He disapproved of it, and it would have been actual\nmadness not to have listened to his reasons.\nJune 11.\n \nSay what you will, I can remain here no longer. Why should I\nremain? Time hangs heavy upon my hands. The prince is as gracious\nto me as any one could be, and yet I am not at my ease. There is,\nindeed, nothing in common between us. He is a man of understanding,\nbut quite of the ordinary kind. His conversation affords me no\nmore amusement than I should derive from the perusal of a well-written\nbook. I shall remain here a week Ionger, and then start again on\nmy travels. My drawings are the best things I have done since I\ncame here. The prince has a taste for the arts, and would improve\nif his mind were not fettered by cold rules and mere technical\nideas. I often lose patience, when, with a glowing imagination, \nI am giving expression to art and nature, he interferes with learned\nsuggestions, and uses at random the technical phraseology of artists.",
        "We arrived here yesterday. The ambassador is indisposed, and will\nnot go out for some days. If he were less peevish and morose, all\nwould be well. I see but too plainly that Heaven has destined me\nto severe trials; but courage! a light heart may bear anything.\nA light heart! I smile to find such a word proceeding from my pen.\nA little more lightheartedness would render me the happiest being\nunder the sun. But must I despair of my talents and faculties,\nwhilst others of far inferior abilities parade before me with the\nutmost self-satisfaction? Gracious Providence, to whom I owe all\nmy powers, why didst thou not withhold some of those blessings I\npossess, and substitute in their place a feeling of self-confidence\nand contentment?",
        "But patience! all will yet be well; for I assure you, my dear\nfriend, you were right: since I have been obliged to associate\ncontinually with other people, and observe what they do, and how\nthey employ themselves, I have become far better satisfied with\nmyself. For we are so constituted by nature, that we are ever\nprone to compare ourselves with others; and our happiness or misery\ndepends very much on the objects and persons around us. On this\naccount, nothing is more dangerous than solitude: there our\nimagination, always disposed to rise, taking a new flight on the\nwings of fancy, pictures to us a chain of beings of whom we seem\nthe most inferior. All things appear greater than they really\nare, and all seem superior to us. This operation of the mind is\nquite natural: we so continually feel our own imperfections, and\nfancy we perceive in others the qualities we do not possess,\nattributing to them also all that we enjoy ourselves, that by this\nprocess we form the idea of a perfect, happy man, — a man, however,\nwho only exists in our own imagination.",
        "But when, in spite of weakness and disappointments, we set to work\nin earnest, and persevere steadily, we often find, that, though\nobliged continually to tack, we make more way than others who have\nthe assistance of wind and tide; and, in truth, there can be no\ngreater satisfaction than to keep pace with others or outstrip\nthem in the race.",
        "I begin to find my situation here more tolerable, considering all\ncircumstances. I find a great advantage in being much occupied;\nand the number of persons I meet, and their different pursuits,\ncreate a varied entertainment for me. I have formed the acquaintance\nof the Count C— and I esteem him more and more every day. He is\na man of strong understanding and great discernment; but, though\nhe sees farther than other people, he is not on that account cold\nin his manner, but capable of inspiring and returning the warmest\naffection. He appeared interested in me on one occasion, when I\nhad to transact some business with him. He perceived, at the first\nword, that we understood each other, and that he could converse\nwith me in a different tone from what he used with others. I\ncannot sufficiently esteem his frank and open kindness to me. It\nis the greatest and most genuine of pleasures to observe a great\nmind in sympathy with our own.",
        "As I anticipated, the ambassador occasions me infinite annoyance.\nHe is the most punctilious blockhead under heaven. He does\neverything step by step, with the trifling minuteness of an old\nwoman; and he is a man whom it is impossible to please, because\nhe is never pleased with himself. I like to do business regularly\nand cheerfully, and, when it is finished, to leave it. But he\nconstantly returns my papers to me, saying, “They will do,” but\nrecommending me to look over them again, as “one may always improve\nby using a better word or a more appropriate particle.” I then\nlose all patience, and wish myself at the devil’s. Not a conjunction,\nnot an adverb, must be omitted: he has a deadly antipathy to all\nthose transpositions of which I am so fond; and, if the music of\nour periods is not tuned to the established, official key, he\ncannot comprehend our meaning. It is deplorable to be connected\nwith such a fellow.",
        "My acquaintance with the Count C— is the only compensation for\nsuch an evil. He told me frankly, the other day, that he was much\ndispleased with the difficulties and delays of the ambassador;\nthat people like him are obstacles, both to themselves and to\nothers. “But,” added he, “one must submit, like a traveller who\nhas to ascend a mountain: if the mountain was not there, the road\nwould be both shorter and pleasanter; but there it is, and he must\nget over it.\"\n \nThe old man perceives the count’s partiality for me: this annoys\nhim, and, he seizes every opportunity to depreciate the count in\nmy hearing. I naturally defend him, and that only makes matters\nworse. Yesterday he made me indignant, for he also alluded to me.\n\"The count,” he said, “is a man of the world, and a good man of\nbusiness: his style is good, and he writes with facility; but,\nlike other geniuses, he has no solid learning.” He looked at me\nwith an expression that seemed to ask if I felt the blow. But it\ndid not produce the desired effect: I despise a man who can think\nand act in such a manner. However, I made a stand, and answered\nwith not a little warmth. The count, I said, was a man entitled\nto respect, alike for his character and his acquirements. I had\nnever met a person whose mind was stored with more useful and\nextensive knowledge, — who had, in fact, mastered such an infinite\nvariety of subjects, and who yet retained all his activity for the\ndetails of ordinary business. This was altogether beyond his\ncomprehension; and I took my leave, lest my anger should be too\nhighly excited by some new absurdity of his.",
        "And you are to blame for all this, you who persuaded me to bend\nmy neck to this yoke by preaching a life of activity to me. If\nthe man who plants vegetables, and carries his corn to town on\nmarket-days, is not more usefully employed than I am, then let me\nwork ten years longer at the galleys to which I am now chained.",
        "Oh, the brilliant wretchedness, the weariness, that one is doomed\nto witness among the silly people whom we meet in society here!\nThe ambition of rank! How they watch, how they toil, to gain\nprecedence! What poor and contemptible passions are displayed in\ntheir utter nakedness! We have a woman here, for example, who\nnever ceases to entertain the company with accounts of her family\nand her estates. Any stranger would consider her a silly being,\nwhose head was turned by her pretensions to rank and property; but\nshe is in reality even more ridiculous, the daughter of a mere\nmagistrate’s clerk from this neighbourhood. I cannot understand\nhow human beings can so debase themselves.",
        "Every day I observe more and more the folly of judging of others\nby ourselves; and I have so much trouble with myseif, and my own\nheart is in such constant agitation, that I am well content to let\nothers pursue their own course, if they only allow me the same\nprivilege.",
        "What provokes me most is the unhappy extent to which distinctions\nof rank are carried. I know perfectly well how necessary are\ninequalities of condition, and I am sensible of the advantages I\nmyself derive therefrom; but I would not have these institutions\nprove a barrier to the small chance of happiness which I may enjoy\non this earth.",
        "I have lately become acquainted with a Miss B—, a very agreeable\ngirl, who has retained her natural manners in the midst of artificial\nlife. Our first conversation pleased us both equally; and, at\ntaking leave, I requested permission to visit her. She consented\nin so obliging a manner, that I waited with impatience for the\narrival of the happy moment. She is not a native of this place,\nbut resides here with her aunt. The countenance of the old lady\nis not prepossessing. I paid her much attention, addressing the\ngreater part of my conversation to her; and, in less than half an\nhour, I discovered what her niece subsequently acknowledged to me,\nthat her aged aunt, having but a small fortune, and a still smaller\nshare of understanding, enjoys no satisfaction except in the\npedigree of her ancestors, no protection save in her noble birth,\nand no enjoyment but in looking from her castle over the heads of\nthe humble citizens. She was, no doubt, handsome in her youth,\nand in her early years probably trifled away her time in rendering\nmany a poor youth the sport of her caprice: in her riper years she\nhas submitted to the yoke of a veteran officer, who, in return for\nher person and her small independence, has spent with her what we\nmay designate her age of brass. He is dead; and she is now a\nwidow, and deserted. She spends her iron age alone, and would not\nbe approached, except for the loveliness of her niece.",
        "What beings are men, whose whole thoughts are occupied with form\nand ceremony, who for years together devote their mental and\nphysical exertions to the task of advancing themselves but one\nstep, and endeavouring to occupy a higher place at the table. Not\nthat such persons would otherwise want employment: on the contrary,\nthey give themselves much trouble by neglecting important business\nfor such petty trifles. Last week a question of precedence arose\nat a sledging-party, and all our amusement was spoiled.",
        "The silly creatures cannot see that it is not place which constitutes\nreal greatness, since the man who occupies the first place but\nseldom plays the principal part. How many kings are governed by\ntheir ministers — how many ministers by their secretaries? Who, in\nsuch cases, is really the chief? He, as it seems to me, who can\nsee through the others, and possesses strength or skill enough to\nmake their power or passions subservient to the execution of his\nown designs.",
        "I must write to you from this place, my dear Charlotte, from a\nsmall room in a country inn, where I have taken shelter from a\nsevere storm. During my whole residence in that wretched place\nD—, where I lived amongst strangers, — strangers, indeed, to\nthis heart, — I never at any time felt the smallest inclination\nto correspond with you; but in this cottage, in this retirement,\nin this solitude, with the snow and hail beating against my\nlattice-pane, you are my first thought. The instant I entered,\nyour figure rose up before me, and the remembrance! O my Charlotte,\nthe sacred, tender remembrance! Gracious Heaven! restore to me\nthe happy moment of our first acquaintance.",
        "Could you but see me, my dear Charlotte, in the whirl of\ndissipation, — how my senses are dried up, but my heart is at no\ntime full. I enjoy no single moment of happiness: all is vain —\nnothing touches me. I stand, as it were, before the raree-show:\nI see the little puppets move, and I ask whether it is not an\noptical illusion. I am amused with these puppets, or, rather, I\nam myself one of them: but, when I sometimes grasp my neighbour’s\nhand, I feel that it is not natural; and I withdraw mine with a\nshudder. In the evening I say I will enjoy the next morning’s\nsunrise, and yet I remain in bed: in the day I promise to ramble\nby moonlight; and I, nevertheless, remain at home. I know not why\nI rise, nor why I go to sleep.",
        "The leaven which animated my existence is gone: the charm which\ncheered me in the gloom of night, and aroused me from my morning\nslumbers, is for ever fled.",
        "I have found but one being here to interest me, a Miss B—. She\nresembles you, my dear Charlotte, if any one can possibly resemble\nyou. “Ah!” you will say, “he has learned how to pay fine compliments.\"\nAnd this is partly true. I have been very agreeable lately, as\nit was not in my power to be otherwise. I have, moreover, a deal\nof wit: and the ladies say that no one understands flattery better,\nor falsehoods you will add; since the one accomplishment invariably\naccompanies the other. But I must tell you of Miss B—. She has\nabundance of soul, which flashes from her deep blue eyes. Her\nrank is a torment to her, and satisfies no one desire of her heart.\nShe would gladly retire from this whirl of fashion, and we often\npicture to ourselves a life of undisturbed happiness in distant\nscenes of rural retirement: and then we speak of you, my dear\nCharlotte; for she knows you, and renders homage to your merits;\nbut her homage is not exacted, but voluntary, she loves you, and\ndelights to hear you made the subject of conversation.",
        "Oh, that I were sitting at your feet in your favourite little room,\nwith the dear children playing around us! If they became troublesome\nto you, I would tell them some appalling goblin story; and they\nwould crowd round me with silent attention. The sun is setting\nin glory; his last rays are shining on the snow, which covers the\nface of the country: the storm is over, and I must return to my\ndungeon. Adieu!— Is Albert with you? and what is he to you? God\nforgive the question.",
        "For a week past we have had the most wretched weather: but this\nto me is a blessing; for, during my residence here, not a single\nfine day has beamed from the heavens, but has been lost to me by\nthe intrusion of somebody. During the severity of rain, sleet,\nfrost, and storm, I congratulate myself that it cannot be worse\nindoors than abroad, nor worse abroad than it is within doors; and\nso I become reconciled. When the sun rises bright in the morning,\nand promises a glorious day, I never omit to exclaim, “There, now,\nthey have another blessing from Heaven, which they will be sure\nto destroy: they spoil everything, — health, fame, happiness,\namusement; and they do this generally through folly, ignorance,\nor imbecility, and always, according to their own account, with\nthe best intentions!” I could often beseech them, on my bended\nknees, to be less resolved upon their own destruction.",
        "I fear that my ambassador and I shall not continue much longer\ntogether. He is really growing past endurance. He transacts\nhis business in so ridiculous a manner, that I am often compelled\nto contradict him, and do things my own way; and then, of course,\nhe thinks them very ill done. He complained of me lately on this\naccount at court; and the minister gave me a reprimand, — a\ngentle one it is true, but still a reprimand. In consequence of\nthis, I was about to tender my resignation, when I received a\nletter, to which I submitted with great respect, on account of the\nhigh, noble, and generous spirit which dictated it. He endeavoured\nto soothe my excessive sensibility, paid a tribute to my extreme\nideas of duty, of good example, and of perseverance in business,\nas the fruit of my youthful ardour, an impulse which he did not\nseek to destroy, but only to moderate, that it might have proper\nplay and be productive of good. So now I am at rest for another\nweek, and no longer at variance with myself. Content and peace\nof mind are valuable things: I could wish, my dear friend, that\nthese precious jewels were less transitory. ",
        "God bless you, my dear friends, and may he grant you that happiness\nwhich he denies to me!",
        "I thank you, Albert, for having deceived me. I waited for the\nnews that your wedding-day was fixed; and I intended on that day,\nwith solemnity, to take down Charlotte’s profile from the wall,\nand to bury it with some other papers I possess. You are now\nunited, and her picture still remains here. Well, let it remain!\nWhy should it not? I know that I am still one of your society,\nthat I still occupy a place uninjured in Charlotte’s heart, that\nI hold the second place therein; and I intend to keep it. Oh, I\nshould become mad if she could forget! Albert, that thought is\nhell! Farewell, Albert farewell, angel of heaven farewell, Charlotte!",
        "I have just had a sad adventure, which will drive me away from\nhere. I lose all patience! — Death! — It is not to be remedied;\nand you alone are to blame, for you urged and impelled me to fill\na post for which I was by no means suited. I have now reason to\nbe satisfied, and so have you! But, that you may not again attribute\nthis fatality to my impetuous temper, I send you, my dear sir, a\nplain and simple narration of the affair, as a mere chronicler of\nfacts would describe it.",
        "The Count of O— likes and distinguishes me. It is well known,\nand I have mentioned this to you a hundred times. Yesterday I\ndined with him. It is the day on which the nobility are accustomed\nto assemble at his house in the evening. I never once thought of\nthe assembly, nor that we subalterns did not belong to such society.\nWell, I dined with the count; and, after dinner, we adjourned to\nthe large hall. We walked up and down together: and I conversed\nwith him, and with Colonel B—, who joined us; and in this manner\nthe hour for the assembly approached. God knows, I was thinking\nof nothing, when who should enter but the honourable Lady accompanied\nby her noble husband and their silly, scheming daughter, with her\nsmall waist and flat neck; and, with disdainful looks and a haughty\nair they passed me by. As I heartily detest the whole race, I\ndetermined upon going away; and only waited till the count had\ndisengaged himself from their impertinent prattle, to take leave,\nwhen the agreeable Miss B— came in. As I never meet her without\nexperiencing a heartfelt pleasure, I stayed and talked to her,\nleaning over the back of her chair, and did not perceive, till\nafter some time, that she seemed a little confused, and ceased to\nanswer me with her usual ease of manner. I was struck with it.\n\"Heavens!” I said to myself, “can she, too, be like the rest?” I\nfelt annoyed, and was about to withdraw; but I remained,\nnotwithstanding, forming excuses for her conduct, fancying she did\nnot mean it, and still hoping to receive some friendly recognition.\nThe rest of the company now arrived. There was the Baron F —, in\nan entire suit that dated from the coronation of Francis I.; the\nChancellor N—, with his deaf wife; the shabbily-dressed I—, whose\nold-fashioned coat bore evidence of modern repairs: this crowned\nthe whole. I conversed with some of my acquaintances, but they\nanswered me laconically. I was engaged in observing Miss B—, and\ndid not notice that the women were whispering at the end of the\nroom, that the murmur extended by degrees to the men, that Madame\nS— addressed the count with much warmth (this was all related to\nme subsequently by Miss B—); till at length the count came up to\nme, and took me to the window. “You know our ridiculous customs,\"\nhe said. “I perceive the company is rather displeased at your\nbeing here. I would not on any account—” “I beg your excellency’s\npardon!” I exclaimed. “I ought to have thought of this before,\nbut I know you will forgive this little inattention. I was going,\"\nI added, “some time ago, but my evil genius detained me.” And I\nsmiled and bowed, to take my leave. He shook me by the hand, in\na manner which expressed everything. I hastened at once from the\nillustrious assembly, sprang into a carriage, and drove to M—.\nI contemplated the setting sun from the top of the hill, and read\nthat beautiful passage in Homer, where Ulysses is entertained by\nthe hospitable herdsmen. This was indeed delightful.",
        "I returned home to supper in the evening. But few persons were\nassembled in the room. They had turned up a corner of the table-cloth,\nand were playing at dice. The good-natured A— came in. He laid\ndown his hat when he saw me, approached me, and said in a low tone,\n\"You have met with a disagreeable adventure.” “I!” I exclaimed.\n\"The count obliged you to withdraw from the assembly!” “Deuce\ntake the assembly!” said I. “I was very glad to be gone.” “I am\ndelighted,” he added, “that you take it so lightly. I am only\nsorry that it is already so much spoken of.” The circumstance\nthen began to pain me. I fancied that every one who sat down, and\neven looked at me, was thinking of this incident; and my heart\nbecame embittered.",
        "And now I could plunge a dagger into my bosom, when I hear myself\neverywhere pitied, and observe the triumph of my enemies, who say\nthat this is always the case with vain persons, whose heads are\nturned with conceit, who affect to despise forms and such petty,\nidle nonsense.",
        "Say what you will of fortitude, but show me the man who can patiently\nendure the laughter of fools, when they have obtained an advantage\nover him. ’Tis only when their nonsense is without foundation\nthat one can suffer it without complaint.",
        "Everything conspires against me. I met Miss B— walking to-day.\nI could not help joining her; and, when we were at a little distance\nfrom her companions, I expressed my sense of her altered manner\ntoward me. “O Werther!” she said, in a tone of emotion, “you, who\nknow my heart, how could you so ill interpret my distress? What\ndid I not suffer for you, from the moment you entered the room!\nI foresaw it all, a hundred times was I on the point of mentioning\nit to you. I knew that the S—s and T—s, with their husbands,\nwould quit the room, rather than remain in your company. I knew\nthat the count would not break with them: and now so much is said\nabout it.” “How!” I exclaimed, and endeavoured to conceal my\nemotion; for all that Adelin had mentioned to me yesterday recurred\nto me painfully at that moment. “Oh, how much it has already cost\nme!” said this amiable girl, while her eyes filled with tears. I\ncould scarcely contain myself, and was ready to throw myself at\nher feet. “Explain yourself!” I cried. Tears flowed down her\ncheeks. I became quite frantic. She wiped them away, without\nattempting to conceal them. “You know my aunt,” she continued;\n\"she was present: and in what light does she consider the affair!\nLast night, and this morning, Werther, I was compelled to listen\nto a lecture upon my, acquaintance with you. I have been obliged\nto hear you condemned and depreciated; and I could not — I dared\nnot — say much in your defence.”",
        "Every word she uttered was a dagger to my heart. She did not feel\nwhat a mercy it would have been to conceal everything from me.\nShe told me, in addition, all the impertinence that would be further\ncirculated, and how the malicious would triumph; how they would\nrejoice over the punishment of my pride, over my humiliation for\nthat want of esteem for others with which I had often been reproached.\nTo hear all this, Wilhelm, uttered by her in a voice of the most\nsincere sympathy, awakened all my passions; and I am still in a\nstate of extreme excitement. I wish I could find a man to jeer\nme about this event. I would sacrifice him to my resentment. The\nsight of his blood might possibly be a relief to my fury. A hundred\ntimes have I seized a dagger, to give ease to this oppressed heart.\nNaturalists tell of a noble race of horses that instinctively open\na vein with their teeth, when heated and exhausted by a long course,\nin order to breathe more freely. I am often tempted to open a\nvein, to procure for myself everlasting liberty.",
        "I have tendered my resignation to the court. I hope it will be\naccepted, and you will forgive me for not having previously consulted\nyou. It is necessary I should leave this place. I know all you\nwill urge me to stay, and therefore I beg you will soften this\nnews to my mother. I am unable to do anything for myself: how,\nthen, should I be competent to assist others? It will afflict her\nthat I should have interrupted that career which would have made\nme first a privy councillor, and then minister, and that I should\nlook behind me, in place of advancing. Argue as you will, combine\nall the reasons which should have induced me to remain, I am going:\nthat is sufficient. But, that you may not be ignorant of my\ndestination, I may mention that the Prince of — is here. He is\nmuch pleased with my company; and, having heard of my intention\nto resign, he has invited me to his country house, to pass the\nspring months with him. I shall be left completely my own master;\nand, as we agree on all subjects but one, I shall try my fortune,\nand accompany him.",
        "Thanks for both your letters. I delayed my reply, and withheld\nthis letter, till I should obtain an answer from the court. I\nfeared my mother might apply to the minister to defeat my purpose.\nBut my request is granted, my resignation is accepted. I shall\nnot recount with what reluctance it was accorded, nor relate what\nthe minister has written: you would only renew your lamentations.\nThe crown prince has sent me a present of five and twenty ducats;\nand, indeed, such goodness has affected me to tears. For this\nreason I shall not require from my mother the money for which I\nlately applied.",
        "I leave this place to-morrow; and, as my native place is only six\nmiles from the high road, I intend to visit it once more, and\nrecall the happy dreams of my childhood. I shall enter at the\nsame gate through which I came with my mother, when, after my\nfather’s death, she left that delightful retreat to immure herself\nin your melancholy town. Adieu, my dear friend: you shall hear of\nmy future career.",
        "\nMorning (Caspar David Friedrich)\n",
        "I have paid my visit to my native place with all the devotion of\na pilgrim, and have experienced many unexpected emotions. Near\nthe great elm tree, which is a quarter of a league from the village,\nI got out of the carriage, and sent it on before, that alone, and\non foot, I might enjoy vividly and heartily all the pleasure of\nmy recollections. I stood there under that same elm which was\nformerly the term and object of my walks. How things have since\nchanged! Then, in happy ignorance, I sighed for a world I did not\nknow, where I hoped to find every pleasure and enjoyment which my\nheart could desire; and now, on my return from that wide world, O\nmy friend, how many disappointed hopes and unsuccessful plans have\nI brought back!",
        "As I contemplated the mountains which lay stretched out before me,\nI thought how often they had been the object of my dearest desires.\nHere used I to sit for hours together with my eyes bent upon them,\nardently longing to wander in the shade of those woods, to lose\nmyself in those valleys, which form so delightful an object in the\ndistance. With what reluctance did I leave this charming spot;\nwhen my hour of recreation was over, and my leave of absence\nexpired! I drew near to the village: all the well-known old\nsummerhouses and gardens were recognised again; I disliked the new\nones, and all other alterations which had taken place. I entered\nthe village, and all my former feelings returned. I cannot, my\ndear friend, enter into details, charming as were my sensations:\nthey would be dull in the narration. I had intended to lodge in\nthe market-place, near our old house. As soon as I entered, I\nperceived that the schoolroom, where our childhood had been taught\nby that good old woman, was converted into a shop. I called to\nmind the sorrow, the heaviness, the tears, and oppression of heart,\nwhich I experienced in that confinement. Every step produced some\nparticular impression. A pilgrim in the Holy Land does not meet\nso many spots pregnant with tender recollections, and his soul is\nhardly moved with greater devotion. One incident will serve for\nillustration. I followed the course of a stream to a farm, formerly\na delightful walk of mine, and paused at the spot, where, when\nboys, we used to amuse ourselves making ducks and drakes upon the\nwater. I recollected so well how I used formerly to watch the\ncourse of that same stream, following it with inquiring eagerness,\nforming romantic ideas of the countries it was to pass through;\nbut my imagination was soon exhausted: while the water continued\nflowing farther and farther on, till my fancy became bewildered\nby the contemplation of an invisible distance. Exactly such, my\ndear friend, so happy and so confined, were the thoughts of our\ngood ancestors. Their feelings and their poetry were fresh as\nchildhood. And, when Ulysses talks of the immeasurable sea and\nboundless earth, his epithets are true, natural, deeply felt, and\nmysterious. Of what importance is it that I have learned, with\nevery schoolboy, that the world is round? Man needs but little\nearth for enjoyment, and still less for his final repose.",
        "I am at present with the prince at his hunting lodge. He is a man\nwith whom one can live happily. He is honest and unaffected. There\nare, however, some strange characters about him, whom I cannot at\nall understand. They do not seem vicious, and yet they do not\ncarry the appearance of thoroughly honest men. Sometimes I am\ndisposed to believe them honest, and yet I cannot persuade myself\nto confide in them. It grieves me to hear the prince occasionally\ntalk of things which he has only read or heard of, and always with\nthe same view in which they have been represented by others.",
        "He values my understanding and talents more highly than my heart,\nbut I am proud of the latter only. It is the sole source of\neverything of our strength, happiness, and misery. All the knowledge\nI possess every one else can acquire, but my heart is exclusively\nmy own.",
        "I have had a plan in my head of which I did not intend to speak\nto you until it was accomplished: now that it has failed, I may\nas well mention it. I wished to enter the army, and had long been\ndesirous of taking the step. This, indeed, was the chief reason\nfor my coming here with the prince, as he is a general in the\nservice. I communicated my design to him during one of our walks\ntogether. He disapproved of it, and it would have been actual\nmadness not to have listened to his reasons.",
        "Once more I am a wanderer, a pilgrim, through the world. But what\nelse are you!",
        "Whither am I going? I will tell you in confidence. I am obliged\nto continue a fortnight longer here, and then I think it would be\nbetter for me to visit the mines in —. But I am only deluding\nmyself thus. The fact is, I wish to be near Charlotte again, that\nis all. I smile at the suggestions of my heart, and obey its\ndictates.",
        "No, no! it is yet well all is well! I her husband! O God, who\ngave me being, if thou hadst destined this happiness for me, my\nwhole life would have been one continual thanksgiving! But I will\nnot murmur — forgive these tears, forgive these fruitless wishes.\nShe — my wife! Oh, the very thought of folding that dearest of\nHeaven’s creatures in my arms! Dear Wilhelm, my whole frame feels\nconvulsed when I see Albert put his arms around her slender waist!",
        "And shall I avow it? Why should I not, Wilhelm? She would have\nbeen happier with me than with him. Albert is not the man to\nsatisfy the wishes of such a heart. He wants a certain sensibility;\nhe wants — in short, their hearts do not beat in unison. How\noften, my dear friend, im reading a passage from some interesting\nbook, when my heart and Charlotte’s seemed to meet, and in a hundred\nother instances when our sentiments were unfolded by the story of\nsome fictitious character, have I felt that we were made for each\nother! But, dear Wilhelm, he loves her with his whole soul; and\nwhat does not such a love deserve?",
        "I have been interrupted by an insufferable visit. I have dried\nmy tears, and composed my thoughts. Adieu, my best friend!",
        "I am not alone unfortunate. All men are disappointed in their\nhopes, and deceived in their expectations. I have paid a visit\nto my good old woman under the lime-trees. The eldest boy ran\nout to meet me: his exclamation of joy brought out his mother,\nbut she had a very melancholy look. Her first word was, “Alas!\ndear sir, my little John is dead.” He was the youngest of her\nchildren. I was silent. “And my husband has returned from\nSwitzerland without any money; and, if some kind people had not\nassisted him, he must have begged his way home. He was taken ill\nwith fever on his journey.” I could answer nothing, but made the\nlittle one a present. She invited me to take some fruit: I complied,\nand left the place with a sorrowful heart.",
        "My sensations are constantly changing. Sometimes a happy prospect\nopens before me; but alas! it is only for a moment; and then, when\nI am lost in reverie, I cannot help saying to myself, “If Albert\nwere to die? — Yes, she would become — and I should be” — and\nso I pursue a chimera, till it leads me to the edge of a precipice\nat which I shudder.",
        "When I pass through the same gate, and walk along the same road\nwhich first conducted me to Charlotte, my heart sinks within me\nat the change that has since taken place. All, all, is altered!\nNo sentiment, no pulsation of my heart, is the same. My sensations\nare such as would occur to some departed prince whose spirit should\nreturn to visit the superb palace which he had built in happy times,\nadorned with costly magnificence, and left to a beloved son, but\nwhose glory he should find departed, and its halls deserted and\nin ruins.",
        "I sometimes cannot understand how she can love another, how she\ndares love another, when I love nothing in this world so completely,\nso devotedly, as I love her, when I know only her, and have no\nother possession.",
        "It is even so! As nature puts on her autumn tints it becomes\nautumn with me and around me. My leaves are sere and yellow, and\nthe neighbouring trees are divested of their foliage. Do you\nremember my writing to you about a peasant boy shortly after my\narrival here? I have just made inquiries about him in Walheim.\nThey say he has been dismissed from his service, and is now avoided\nby every one. I met him yesterday on the road, going to a\nneighbouring village. I spoke to him, and he told me his story.\nIt interested me exceedingly, as you will easily understand when\nI repeat it to you. But why should I trouble you? Why should I\nnot reserve all my sorrow for myself? Why should I continue to\ngive you occasion to pity and blame me? But no matter: this also\nis part of my destiny.",
        "At first the peasant lad answered my inquiries with a sort of\nsubdued melancholy, which seemed to me the mark of a timid disposition;\nbut, as we grew to understand each other, he spoke with less reserve,\nand openly confessed his faults, and lamented his misfortune. I\nwish, my dear friend, I could give proper expression to his\nlanguage. He told me with a sort of pleasurable recollection,\nthat, after my departure, his passion for his mistress increased\ndaily, until at last he neither knew what he did nor what he said,\nnor what was to become of him. He could neither eat nor drink nor\nsleep: he felt a sense of suffocation; he disobeyed all orders,\nand forgot all commands involuntarily; he seemed as if pursued by\nan evil spirit, till one day, knowing that his mistress had gone\nto an upper chamber, he had followed, or, rather, been drawn after\nher. As she proved deaf to his entreaties, he had recourse to\nviolence. He knows not what happened; but he called God to witness\nthat his intentions to her were honourable, and that he desired\nnothing more sincerely than that they should marry, and pass their\nlives together. When he had come to this point, he began to\nhesitate, as if there was something which he had not courage to\nutter, till at length he acknowledged with some confusion certain\nlittle confidences she had encouraged, and liberties she had allowed.\nHe broke off two or three times in his narration, and assured me\nmost earnestly that he had no wish to make her bad, as he termed\nit, for he loved her still as sincerely as ever; that the tale\nhad never before escaped his lips, and was only now told to convince\nme that he was not utterly lost and abandoned. And here, my dear\nfriend, I must commence the old song which you know I utter eternally.\nIf I could only represent the man as he stood, and stands now\nbefore me, could I only give his true expressions, you would feel\ncompelled to sympathise in his fate. But enough: you, who know my\nmisfortune and my disposition, can easily comprehend the attraction\nwhich draws me toward every unfortunate being, but particularly\ntoward him whose story I have recounted.",
        "On perusing this letter a second time, I find I have omitted the\nconclusion of my tale; but it is easily supplied. She became\nreserved toward him, at the instigation of her brother who had\nlong hated him, and desired his expulsion from the house, fearing\nthat his sister’s second marriage might deprive his children of\nthe handsome fortune they expected from her; as she is childless.\nHe was dismissed at length; and the whole affair occasioned so\nmuch scandal, that the mistress dared not take him back, even if\nshe had wished it. She has since hired another servant, with whom,\nthey say, her brother is equally displeased, and whom she is likely\nto marry; but my informant assures me that he himself is determined\nnot to survive such a catastrophe.",
        "This story is neither exaggerated nor embellished: indeed, I have\nweakened and impaired it in the narration, by the necessity of\nusing the more refined expressions of society.",
        "This love, then, this constancy, this passion, is no poetical\nfiction. It is actual, and dwells in its greatest purity amongst\nthat class of mankind whom we term rude, uneducated. We are the\neducated, not the perverted. But read this story with attention,\nI implore you. I am tranquil to-day, for I have been employed\nupon this narration: you see by my writing that I am not so agitated\nas usual. I read and re-read this tale, Wilhelm: it is the history\nof your friend! My fortune has been and will be similar; and I\nam neither half so brave nor half so determined as the poor wretch\nwith whom I hesitate to compare myself.",
        "Charlotte had written a letter to her husband in the country, where\nhe was detained by business. It commenced, “My dearest love,\nreturn as soon as possible: I await you with a thousand raptures.\"\nA friend who arrived, brought word, that, for certain reasons, he\ncould not return immediately. Charlotte’s letter was not forwarded,\nand the same evening it fell into my hands. I read it, and smiled.\nShe asked the reason. “What a heavenly treasure is imagination:\"\nI exclaimed; “I fancied for a moment that this was written to me.\"\nShe paused, and seemed displeased. I was silent.",
        "It cost me much to part with the blue coat which I wore the first\ntime I danced with Charlotte. But I could not possibly wear it\nany longer. But I have ordered a new one, precisely similar, even\nto the collar and sleeves, as well as a new waistcoat and pantaloons.",
        "But it does not produce the same effect upon me. I know not how\nit is, but I hope in time I shall like it better.",
        "She has been absent for some days. She went to meet Albert.\nTo-day I visited her: she rose to receive me, and I kissed her\nhand most tenderly.",
        "A canary at the moment flew from a mirror, and settled upon her\nshoulder. “Here is a new friend,” she observed, while she made\nhim perch upon her hand: “he is a present for the children. What\na dear he is! Look at him! When I feed him, he flutters with his\nwings, and pecks so nicely. He kisses me, too, only look!”",
        "She held the bird to her mouth; and he pressed her sweet lips with\nso much fervour that he seemed to feel the excess of bliss which\nhe enjoyed.",
        "“He shall kiss you too,” she added; and then she held the bird\ntoward me. His little beak moved from her mouth to mine, and the\ndelightful sensation seemed like the forerunner of the sweetest\nbliss.",
        "“A kiss,” I observed, “does not seem to satisfy him: he wishes for\nfood, and seems disappointed by these unsatisfactory endearments.”",
        "“But he eats out of my mouth,” she continued, and extended her\nlips to him containing seed; and she smiled with all the charm of\na being who has allowed an innocent participation of her love.",
        "I turned my face away. She should not act thus. She ought not to\nexcite my imagination with such displays of heavenly innocence and\nhappiness, nor awaken my heart from its slumbers, in which it\ndreams of the worthlessness of life! And why not? Because she\nknows how much I love her.",
        "It makes me wretched, Wilhelm, to think that there should be men\nincapable of appreciating the few things which possess a real value\nin life. You remember the walnut trees at S—, under which I used\nto sit with Charlotte, during my visits to the worthy old vicar.\nThose glorious trees, the very sight of which has so often filled\nmy heart with joy, how they adorned and refreshed the parsonage\nyard, with their wide-extended branches! and how pleasing was our\nremembrance of the good old pastor, by whose hands they were\nplanted so many years ago: The schoolmaster has frequently mentioned\nhis name. He had it from his grandfather. He must have been a\nmost excellent man; and, under the shade of those old trees, his\nmemory was ever venerated by me. The schoolmaster informed us\nyesterday, with tears in his eyes, that those trees had been felled.\nYes, cut to the ground! I could, in my wrath, have slain the\nmonster who struck the first stroke. And I must endure this! —\nI, who, if I had had two such trees in my own court, and one had\ndied from old age, should have wept with real affliction. But\nthere is some comfort left, such a thing is sentiment, the whole\nvillage murmurs at the misfortune; and I hope the vicar’s wife\nwill soon find, by the cessation of the villagers’ presents, how\nmuch she has wounded the feelings of the neighborhhood. It was\nshe who did it, the wife of the present incumbent (our good old\nman is dead), a tall, sickly creature who is so far right to\ndisregard the world, as the world totally disregards her. The\nsilly being affects to be learned, pretends to examine the canonical\nbooks, lends her aid toward the new-fashioned reformation of\nChristendom, moral and critical, and shrugs up her shoulders at\nthe mention of Lavater’s enthusiasm. Her health is destroyed, on\naccount of which she is prevented from having any enjoyment here\nbelow. Only such a creature could have cut down my walnut trees!\nI can never pardon it. Hear her reasons. The falling leaves made\nthe court wet and dirty; the branches obstructed the light; boys\nthrew stones at the nuts when they were ripe, and the noise affected\nher nerves; and disturbed her profound meditations, when she was\nweighing the diffculties of Kennicot, Semler, and Michaelis.\nFinding that all the parish, particularly the old people, were\ndispleased, I asked “why they allowed it?” “Ah, sir!” they replied,\n\"when the steward orders, what can we poor peasants do?” But one\nthing has happened well. The steward and the vicar (who, for once,\nthought to reap some advantage from the caprices of his wife)\nintended to divide the trees between them. The revenue-office,\nbeing informed of it, revived an old claim to the ground where the\ntrees had stood, and sold them to the best bidder. There they\nstill lie on the ground. If I were the sovereign, I should know\nhow to deal with them all, vicar, steward, and revenue-office.\nSovereign, did I say? I should, in that case, care little about\nthe trees that grew in the country.",
        "Only to gaze upon her dark eyes is to me a source of happiness!\nAnd what grieves me, is, that Albert does not seem so happy as he\n— hoped to be — as I should have been — if — I am no friend\nto these pauses, but here I cannot express it otherwise; and\nprobably I am explicit enough.",
        "Ossian has superseded Homer in my heart. To what a world does\nthe illustrious bard carry me! To wander over pathless wilds,\nsurrounded by impetuous whirlwinds, where, by the feeble light\nof the moon, we see the spirits of our ancestors; to hear from\nthe mountain-tops, mid the roar of torrents, their plaintive\nsounds issuing from deep caverns, and the sorrowful lamentations\nof a maiden who sighs and expires on the mossy tomb of the warrior\nby whom she was adored. I meet this bard with silver hair; he\nwanders in the valley; he seeks the footsteps of his fathers, and,\nalas! he finds only their tombs. Then, contemplating the pale\nmoon, as she sinks beneath the waves of the rolling sea, the memory\nof bygone days strikes the mind of the hero, days when approaching\ndanger invigorated the brave, and the moon shone upon his bark\nladen with spoils, and returning in triumph. When I read in his\ncountenance deep sorrow, when I see his dying glory sink exhausted\ninto the grave, as he inhales new and heart-thrilling delight\nfrom his approaching union with his beloved, and he casts a look\non the cold earth and the tall grass which is so soon to cover him,\nand then exclaims, “The traveller will come, — he will come who\nhas seen my beauty, and he will ask, ’Where is the bard, where is\nthe illustrious son of Fingal?’ He will walk over my tomb, and\nwill seek me in vain!” Then, O my friend, I could instantly, like\na true and noble knight, draw my sword, and deliver my prince from\nthe long and painful languor of a living death, and dismiss my own\nsoul to follow the demigod whom my hand had set free!",
        "Alas! the void the fearful void, which I feel in my bosom! Sometimes\nI think, if I could only once but once, press her to my heart, this\ndreadful void would be filled.",
        "Yes, I feel certain, Wilhelm, and every day I become more certain,\nthat the existence of any being whatever is of very little consequence.\nA friend of Charlotte’s called to see her just now. I withdrew\ninto a neighbouring apartment, and took up a book; but, finding I\ncould not read, I sat down to write. I heard them converse in an\nundertone: they spoke upon indifferent topics, and retailed the\nnews of the town. One was going to be married; another was ill,\nvery ill, she had a dry cough, her face was growing thinner daily,\nand she had occasional fits. “N— is very unwell too,” said\nCharlotte. “His limbs begin to swell already,” answered the other;\nand my lively imagination carried me at once to the beds of the\ninfirm. There I see them struggling against death, with all the\nagonies of pain and horror; and these women, Wilhelm, talk of all\nthis with as much indifference as one would mention the death of\na stranger. And when I look around the apartment where I now am\n— when I see Charlotte’s apparel lying before me, and Albert’s\nwritings, and all those articles of furniture which are so familiar\nto me, even to the very inkstand which I am using, — when I think\nwhat I am to this family — everything. My friends esteem me; I often\ncontribute to their happiness, and my heart seems as if it could\nnot beat without them; and yet — if I were to die, if I were\nto be summoned from the midst of this circle, would they feel —\nor how long would they feel the void which my loss would make in\ntheir existence? How long! Yes, such is the frailty of man, that\neven there, where he has the greatest consciousness of his own\nbeing, where he makes the strongest and most forcible impression,\neven in the memory, in the heart, of his beloved, there also he\nmust perish, — vanish, — and that quickly.",
        "I could tear open my bosom with vexation to think how little we\nare capable of influencing the feelings of each other. No one\ncan communicate to me those sensations of love, joy, rapture, and\ndelight which I do not naturally possess; and, though my heart may\nglow with the most lively affection, I cannot make the happiness\nof one in whom the same warmth is not inherent.",
        "I possess so much, but my love for her absorbs it all. I possess\nso much, but without her I have nothing.",
        "One hundred times have I been on the point of embracing her.\nHeavens! what a torment it is to see so much loveliness passing\nand repassing before us, and yet not dare to lay hold of it!\nAnd laying hold is the most natural of human instincts. Do not\nchildren touch everything they see? And I!",
        "Witness, Heaven, how often I lie down in my bed with a wish, and\neven a hope, that I may never awaken again. And in the morning,\nwhen I open my eyes, I behold the sun once more, and am wretched.\nIf I were whimsical, I might blame the weather, or an acquaintance,\nor some personal disappointment, for my discontented mind; and then\nthis insupportable load of trouble would not rest entirely upon\nmyself. But, alas! I feel it too sadly. I am alone the cause\nof my own woe, am I not? Truly, my own bosom contains the source\nof all my sorrow, as it previously contained the source of all my\npleasure. Am I not the same being who once enjoyed an excess of\nhappiness, who, at every step, saw paradise open before him, and\nwhose heart was ever expanded toward the whole world? And this\nheart is now dead, no sentiment can revive it; my eyes are dry;\nand my senses, no more refreshed by the influence of soft tears,\nwither and consume my brain. I suffer much, for I have lost the\nonly charm of life: that active, sacred power which created worlds\naround me, — it is no more. When I look from my window at the\ndistant hills, and behold the morning sun breaking through the\nmists, and illuminating the country around, which is still wrapped\nin silence, whilst the soft stream winds gently through the willows,\nwhich have shed their leaves; when glorious nature displays all\nher beauties before me, and her wondrous prospects are ineffectual\nto extract one tear of joy from my withered heart, I feel that in\nsuch a moment I stand like a reprobate before heaven, hardened,\ninsensible, and unmoved. Oftentimes do I then bend my knee to the\nearth, and implore God for the blessing of tears, as the desponding\nlabourer in some scorching climate prays for the dews of heaven\nto moisten his parched corn.",
        "But I feel that God does not grant sunshine or rain to our\nimportunate entreaties. And oh, those bygone days, whose memory\nnow torments me! why were they so fortunate? Because I then\nwaited with patience for the blessings of the Eternal, and received\nhis gifts with the grateful feelings of a thankful heart.",
        "Charlotte has reproved me for my excesses, with so much tenderness\nand goodness! I have lately been in the habit of drinking more\nwine than heretofore. “Don’t do it,” she said. “Think of Charlotte!\"\n\"Think of you!” I answered; “need you bid me do so? Think of you\n— I do not think of you: you are ever before my soul! This very\nmorning I sat on the spot where, a few days ago, you descended\nfrom the carriage, and—” She immediately changed the subject to\nprevent me from pursuing it farther. My dear friend, my energies\nare all prostrated: she can do with me what she pleases.",
        "I thank you, Wilhelm, for your cordial sympathy, for your excellent\nadvice; and I implore you to be quiet. Leave me to my sufferings.\nIn spite of my wretchedness, I have still strength enough for\nendurance. I revere religion — you know I do. I feel that it\ncan impart strength to the feeble and comfort to the afflicted,\nbut does it affect all men equally? Consider this vast universe:\nyou will see thousands for whom it has never existed, thousands\nfor whom it will never exist, whether it be preached to them, or\nnot; and must it, then, necessarily exist for me? Does not the\nSon of God himself say that they are his whom the Father has given\nto him? Have I been given to him? What if the Father will retain\nme for himself, as my heart sometimes suggests? I pray you, do\nnot misinterpret this. Do not extract derision from my harmless\nwords. I pour out my whole soul before you. Silence were otherwise\npreferable to me, but I need not shrink from a subject of which\nfew know more than I do myself. What is the destiny of man, but\nto fill up the measure of his sufferings, and to drink his allotted\ncup of bitterness? And if that same cup proved bitter to the God\nof heaven, under a human form, why should I affect a foolish pride,\nand call it sweet? Why should I be ashamed of shrinking at that\nfearful moment, when my whole being will tremble between existence\nand annihilation, when a remembrance of the past, like a flash of\nlightning, will illuminate the dark gulf of futurity, when everything\nshall dissolve around me, and the whole world vanish away? Is not\nthis the voice of a creature oppressed beyond all resource,\nself-deficient, about to plunge into inevitable destruction, and\ngroaning deeply at its inadequate strength, “My God! my God! why\nhast thou forsaken me?” And should I feel ashamed to utter the\nsame expression? Should I not shudder at a prospect which had its\nfears, even for him who folds up the heavens like a garment?",
        "She does not feel, she does not know, that she is preparing a poison\nwhich will destroy us both; and I drink deeply of the draught which\nis to prove my destruction. What mean those looks of kindness with\nwhich she often — often? no, not often, but sometimes, regards me,\nthat complacency with which she hears the involuntary sentiments\nwhich frequently escape me, and the tender pity for my sufferings\nwhich appears in her countenance?",
        "Yesterday, when I took leave she seized me by the hand, and said,\n\"Adieu, dear Werther.” Dear Werther! It was the first time she\never called me dear: the sound sunk deep into my heart. I have\nrepeated it a hundred times; and last night, on going to bed, and\ntalking to myself of various things, I suddenly said, “Good night,\ndear Werther!” and then could not but laugh at myself.",
        "I cannot pray, “Leave her to me !” and yet she often seems to\nbelong to me. I cannot pray, “Give her to me!” for she is\nanother’s. In this way I affect mirth over my troubles; and,\nif I had time, I could compose a whole litany of antitheses.",
        "She is sensible of my sufferings. This morning her look pierced\nmy very soul. I found her alone, and she was silent: she steadfastly\nsurveyed me. I no longer saw in her face the charms of beauty or\nthe fire of genius: these had disappeared. But I was affected by\nan expression much more touching, a look of the deepest sympathy\nand of the softest pity. Why was I afraid to throw myself at her\nfeet? Why did I not dare to take her in my arms, and answer her\nby a thousand kisses? She had recourse to her piano for relief,\nand in a low and sweet voice accompanied the music with delicious\nsounds. Her lips never appeared so lovely: they seemed but just\nto open, that they might imbibe the sweet tones which issued from\nthe instrument, and return the heavenly vibration from her lovely\nmouth. Oh! who can express my sensations? I was quite overcome,\nand, bending down, pronounced this vow: “Beautiful lips, which the\nangels guard, never will I seek to profane your purity with a kiss.\"\nAnd yet, my friend, oh, I wish — but my heart is darkened by doubt\nand indecision — could I but taste felicity, and then die to expiate\nthe sin! What sin?",
        "Oftentimes I say to myself, “Thou alone art wretched: all other\nmortals are happy, none are distressed like thee!” Then I read\na passage in an ancient poet, and I seem to understand my own\nheart. I have so much to endure! Have men before me ever been\nso wretched?",
        "I shall never be myself again! Wherever I go, some fatality occurs\nto distract me. Even to-day alas — for our destiny! alas for\nhuman nature!",
        "About dinner-time I went to walk by the river-side, for I had no\nappetite. Everything around seemed gloomy: a cold and damp easterly\nwind blew from the mountains, and black, heavy clouds spread over\nthe plain. I observed at a distance a man in a tattered coat: he\nwas wandering among the rocks, and seemed to be looking for plants.\nWhen I approached, he turned round at the noise; and I saw that\nhe had an interesting countenance in which a settled melancholy,\nstrongly marked by benevolence, formed the principal feature.\nHis long black hair was divided, and flowed over his shoulders.\nAs his garb betokened a person of the lower order, I thought he\nwould not take it ill if I inquired about his business; and I\ntherefore asked what he was seeking. He replied, with a deep sigh,\nthat he was looking for flowers, and could find none. “But it is\nnot the season,” I observed, with a smile. “Oh, there are so many\nflowers!” he answered, as he came nearer to me. “In my garden\nthere are roses and honeysuckles of two sorts: one sort was given\nto me by my father! they grow as plentifully as weeds; I have been\nlooking for them these two days, and cannot find them. There are\nflowers out there, yellow, blue, and red; and that centaury has a\nvery pretty blossom: but I can find none of them.” I observed his\npeculiarity, and therefore asked him, with an air of indifference,\nwhat he intended to do with his flowers. A strange smile overspread\nhis countenance. Holding his finger to his mouth, he expressed a\nhope that I would not betray him; and he then informed me that he\nhad promised to gather a nosegay for his mistress. “That is right,\"\nsaid I. “Oh!” he replied, “she possesses many other things as\nwell: she is very rich.” “And yet,” I continued, “she likes your\nnosegays.” “Oh, she has jewels and crowns!” he exclaimed. I asked\nwho she was. “If the states-general would but pay me,” he added,\n\"I should be quite another man. Alas! there was a time when I was\nso happy; but that is past, and I am now—” He raised his swimming\neyes to heaven. “And you were happy once?” I observed. “Ah,\nwould I were so still!” was his reply. “I was then as gay and\ncontented as a man can be.” An old woman, who was coming toward\nus, now called out, “Henry, Henry! where are you? We have been\nlooking for you everywhere: come to dinner.” “Is he your son?\"\nI inquired, as I went toward her. “Yes,” she said: “he is my poor,\nunfortunate son. The Lord has sent me a heavy affliction.” I asked\nwhether he had been long in this state. She answered, “He has been\nas calm as he is at present for about six months. I thank Heaven\nthat he has so far recovered: he was for one whole year quite raving,\nand chained down in a madhouse. Now he injures no one, but talks\nof nothing else than kings and queens. He used to be a very good,\nquiet youth, and helped to maintain me; he wrote a very fine hand;\nbut all at once he became melancholy, was seized with a violent\nfever, grew distracted, and is now as you see. If I were only to\ntell you, sir—” I interrupted her by asking what period it was\nin which he boasted of having been so happy. “Poor boy!” she\nexclaimed, with a smile of cormpassion, “he means the time when\nhe was completely deranged, a time he never ceases to regret,\nwhen he was in the madhouse, and unconscious of everything.” I\nwas thunderstruck: I placed a piece of money in her hand, and\nhastened away.",
        "“You were happy!” I exclaimed, as I returned quickly to the\ntown, “’as gay and contented as a man can be!’” God of heaven!\nand is this the destiny of man? Is he only happy before he has\nacquired his reason, or after he has lost it? Unfortunate being!\nAnd yet I envy your fate: I envy the delusion to which you are a\nvictim. You go forth with joy to gather flowers for your princess,\n— in winter, — and grieve when you can find none, and cannot\nunderstand why they do not grow. But I wander forth without joy,\nwithout hope, without design; and I return as I came. You fancy\nwhat a man you would be if the states general paid you. Happy\nmortal, who can ascribe your wretchedness to an earthly cause!\nYou do not know, you do not feel, that in your own distracted\nheart and disordered brain dwells the source of that unhappiness\nwhich all the potentates on earth cannot relieve.",
        "Let that man die unconsoled who can deride the invalid for undertaking\na journey to distant, healthful springs, where he often finds only\na heavier disease and a more painful death, or who can exult over\nthe despairing mind of a sinner, who, to obtain peace of conscience\nand an alleviation of misery, makes a pilgrimage to the Holy\nSepulchre. Each laborious step which galls his wounded feet in\nrough and untrodden paths pours a drop of balm into his troubled\nsoul, and the journey of many a weary day brings a nightly relief\nto his anguished heart. Will you dare call this enthusiasm, ye\ncrowd of pompous declaimers? Enthusiasm! 0 God! thou seest my\ntears. Thou hast allotted us our portion of misery: must we also\nhave brethren to persecute us, to deprive us of our consolation,\nof our trust in thee, and in thy love and mercy? For our trust in\nthe virtue of the healing root, or in the strength of the vine,\nwhat is it else than a belief in thee from whom all that surrounds\nus derives its healing and restoring powers? Father, whom I know\nnot, — who wert once wont to fill my soul, but who now hidest thy\nface from me, — call me back to thee; be silent no longer; thy\nsilence shall not delay a soul which thirsts after thee. What man,\nwhat father, could be angry with a son for returning to him suddenly,\nfor falling on his neck, and exclaiming, “I am here again, my\nfather! forgive me if I have anticipated my journey, and returned\nbefore the appointed time! The world is everywhere the same, —\na scene of labour and pain, of pleasure and reward; but what does\nit all avail? I am happy only where thou art, and in thy presence\nam I content to suffer or enjoy.” And wouldst thou, heavenly Father,\nbanish such a child from thy presence?",
        "Wilhelm, the man about whom I wrote to you — that man so enviable\nin his misfortunes — was secretary to Charlotte’s father; and an\nunhappy passion for her which he cherished, concealed, and at\nlength discovered, caused him to be dismissed from his situation.\nThis made him mad. Think, whilst you peruse this plain narration,\nwhat an impression the circumstance has made upon me! But it was\nrelated to me by Albert with as much calmness as you will probably\nperuse it.",
        "I implore your attention. It is all over with me. I can support\nthis state no longer. To-day I was sitting by Charlotte. She was\nplaying upon her piano a succession of delightful melodies, with\nsuch intense expression! Her little sister was dressing her doll\nupon my lap. The tears came into my eyes. I leaned down, and\nlooked intently at her wedding-ring: my tears fell — immediately\nshe began to play that favourite, that divine, air which has so\noften enchanted me. I felt comfort from a recollection of the\npast, of those bygone days when that air was familiar to me; and\nthen I recalled all the sorrows and the disappointments which I\nhad since endured. I paced with hasty strides through the room,\nmy heart became convulsed with painful emotions. At length I\nwent up to her, and exclaimed With eagerness, “For Heaven’s sake,\nplay that air no longer!” She stopped, and looked steadfastly at\nme. She then said, with a smile which sunk deep into my heart,\n\"Werther, you are ill: your dearest food is distasteful to you.\nBut go, I entreat you, and endeavour to compose yourself.” I\ntore myself away. God, thou seest my torments, and wilt end them!",
        "How her image haunts me! Waking or asleep, she fills my entire\nsoul! Soon as I close my eyes, here, in my brain, where all the\nnerves of vision are concentrated, her dark eyes are imprinted.\nHere — I do not know how to describe it; but, if I shut my eyes,\nhers are immediately before me: dark as an abyss they open upon\nme, and absorb my senses.",
        "And what is man — that boasted demigod? Do not his powers fail\nwhen he most requires their use? And whether he soar in joy, or\nsink in sorrow, is not his career in both inevitably arrested?\nAnd, whilst he fondly dreams that he is grasping at infinity,\ndoes he not feel compelled to return to a consciousness of his\ncold, monotonous existence?",
        "It is a matter of extreme regret that we want original evidence\nof the last remarkable days of our friend; and we are, therefore,\nobliged to interrupt the progress of his correspondence, and to\nsupply the deficiency by a connected narration.",
        "I have felt it my duty to collect accurate information from the\nmouths of persons well acquainted with his history. The story\nis simple; and all the accounts agree, except in some unimportant\nparticulars. It is true, that, with respect to the characters of\nthe persons spoken of, opinions and judgments vary.",
        "We have only, then, to relate conscientiously the facts which our\ndiligent labour has enabled us to collect, to give the letters\nof the deceased, and to pay particular attention to the slightest\nfragment from his pen, more especially as it is so difficult to\ndiscover the real and correct motives of men who are not of the\ncommon order.",
        "Sorrow and discontent had taken deep root in Werther’s soul, and\ngradually imparted their character to his whole being. The harmony\nof his mind became completely disturbed; a perpetual excitement\nand mental irritation, which weakened his natural powers, produced\nthe saddest etfects upon him, and rendered him at length the victim\nof an exhaustion against which he struggled with still more painful\nefforts than he had displayed, even in contending with his other\nmisfortunes. His mental anxiety weakened his various good qualities;\nand he was soon converted into a gloomy companion, always unhappy\nand unjust in his ideas, the more wretched he became. This was,\nat least, the opinion of Albert’s friends. They assert, moreover,\nthat the character of Albert himself had undergone no change in\nthe meantime: he was still the same being whom Werther had loved,\nhonoured, and respected from the commencement. His love for\nCharlotte was unbounded: he was proud of her, and desired that\nshe should be recognised by every one as the noblest of created\nbeings. Was he, however, to blame for wishing to avert from her\nevery appearance of suspicion? or for his unwillingness to share\nhis rich prize with another, even for a moment, and in the most\ninnocent manner? It is asserted that Albert frequently retired\nfrom his wife’s apartment during Werther’s visits; but this did\nnot arise from hatred or aversion to his friend, but only from a\nfeeling that his presence was oppressive to Werther.",
        "Charlotte’s father, who was confined to the house by indisposition,\nwas accustomed to send his carriage for her, that she might make\nexcursions in the neighbourhood. One day the weather had been\nunusually severe, and the whole country was covered with snow.",
        "Werther went for Charlotte the following morning, in order that,\nif Albert were absent, he might conduct her home.",
        "The beautiful weather produced but little impression on his troubled\nspirit. A heavy weight lay upon his soul, deep melancholy had\ntaken possession of him, and his mind knew no change save from one\npainful thought to another.",
        "As he now never enjoyed internal peace, the condition of his fellow\ncreatures was to him a perpetual source of trouble and distress.\nHe believed he had disturbed the happiness of Albert and his wife;\nand, whilst he censured himself strongly for this, he began to\nentertain a secret dislike to Albert.",
        "His thoughts were occasionally directed to this point. “Yes,” he\nwould repeat to himself, with ill-concealed dissatisfaction, “yes,\nthis is, after all, the extent of that confiding, dear, tender,\nand sympathetic love, that calm and eternal fidelity! What do I\nbehold but satiety and indifference? Does not every frivolous\nengagement attract him more than his charming and lovely wife?\nDoes he know how to prize his happiness? Can he value her as she\ndeserves? He possesses her, it is true, I know that, as I know\nmuch more, and I have become accustomed to the thought that he\nwill drive me mad, or, perhaps, murder me. Is his friendship\ntoward me unimpaired? Does he not view my attachment to Charlotte\nas an infringement upon his rights, and consider my attention to\nher as a silent rebuke to himself? I know, and indeed feel, that\nhe dislikes me, that he wishes for my absence, that my presence\nis hateful to him.”",
        "He would often pause when on his way to visit Charlotte, stand\nstill, as though in doubt, and seem desirous of returning, but\nwould nevertheless proceed; and, engaged in such thoughts and\nsoliloquies as we have described, he finally reached the hunting-lodge,\nwith a sort of involuntary consent.",
        "Upon one occasion he entered the house; and, inquiring for\nCharlotte, he observed that the inmates were in a state of\nunusual confusion. The eldest boy informed him that a dreadful\nmisfortune had occurred at Walheim, — that a peasant had been\nmurdered! But this made little impression upon him. Entering\nthe apartment, he found Charlotte engaged reasoning with her father,\nwho, in spite of his infirmity, insisted on going to the scene of\nthe crime, in order to institute an inquiry. The criminal was\nunknown; the victim had been found dead at his own door that\nmorning. Suspicions were excited: the murdered man had been in\nthe service of a widow, and the person who had previously filled\nthe situation had been dismissed from her employment.",
        "As soon as Werther heard this, he exclaimed with great excitement,\n\"Is it possible! I must go to the spot — I cannot delay a moment!\"\nHe hastened to Walheim. Every incident returned vividly to his\nremembrance; and he entertained not the slightest doubt that that\nman was the murderer to whom he had so often spoken, and for whom\nhe entertained so much regard. His way took him past the well-known\nlime trees, to the house where the body had been carried; and his\nfeelings were greatly excited at the sight of the fondly recollected\nspot. That threshold where the neighbours’ children had so often\nplayed together was stained with blood; love and attachment, the\nnoblest feelings of human nature, had been converted into violence\nand murder. The huge trees stood there leafless and covered with\nhoarfrost; the beautiful hedgerows which surrounded the old\nchurchyard wall were withered; and the gravestones, half covered\nwith snow, were visible through the openings.",
        "As he approached the inn, in front of which the whole village was\nassembled, screams were suddenly heard. A troop of armed peasants\nwas seen approaching, and every one exclaimed that the criminal\nhad been apprehended. Werther looked, and was not long in doubt.\nThe prisoner was no other than the servant, who had been formerly\nso attached to the widow, and whom he had met prowling about, with\nthat suppressed anger and ill-concealed despair, which we have\nbefore described.",
        "“What have you done, unfortunate man?” inquired Werther, as he\nadvanced toward the prisoner. The latter turned his eyes upon him\nin silence, and then replied with perfect composure; “No one will\nnow marry her, and she will marry no one.” The prisoner was taken\ninto the inn, and Werther left the place. The mind of Werther was\nfearfully excited by this shocking occurrence. He ceased, however,\nto be oppressed by his usual feeling of melancholy, moroseness,\nand indifference to everything that passed around him. He entertained\na strong degree of pity for the prisoner, and was seized with an\nindescribable anxiety to save him from his impending fate. He\nconsidered him so unfortunate, he deemed his crime so excusable,\nand thought his own condition so nearly similar, that he felt\nconvinced he could make every one else view the matter in the light\nin which he saw it himself. He now became anxious to undertake\nhis defence, and commenced composing an eloquent speech for the\noccasion; and, on his way to the hunting-lodge, he could not refrain\nfrom speaking aloud the statement which he resolved to make to the\njudge.",
        "Upon his arrival, he found Albert had been before him: and he was\na little perplexed by this meeting; but he soon recovered himself,\nand expressed his opinion with much warmth to the judge. The\nlatter shook, his head doubtingly; and although Werther urged his\ncase with the utmost zeal, feeling, and determination in defence\nof his client, yet, as we may easily suppose, the judge was not\nmuch influenced by his appeal. On the contrary, he interrupted\nhim in his address, reasoned with him seriously, and even administered\na rebuke to him for becoming the advocate of a murderer. He\ndemonstrated, that, according to this precedent, every law might\nbe violated, and the public security utterly destroyed. He added,\nmoreover, that in such a case he could himself do nothing,\nwithout incurring the greatest responsibility; that everything\nmust follow in the usual course, and pursue the ordinary channel.",
        "Werther, however, did not abandon his enterprise, and even besought\nthe judge to connive at the flight of the prisoner. But this\nproposal was peremptorily rejected. Albert, who had taken some\npart in the discussion, coincided in opinion with the judge. At\nthis Werther became enraged, and took his leave in great anger,\nafter the judge had more than once assured him that the prisoner\ncould not be saved.",
        "The excess of his grief at this assurance may be inferred from a\nnote we have found amongst his papers, and which was doubtless\nwritten upon this very occasion.",
        "“You cannot be saved, unfortunate man! I see clearly that we\ncannot be saved!”",
        "Werther was highly incensed at the observations which Albert had\nmade to the judge in this matter of the prisoner. He thought he\ncould detect therein a little bitterness toward himself personally;\nand although, upon reflection, it could not escape his sound\njudgment that their view of the matter was correct, he felt the\ngreatest possible reluctance to make such an admission.",
        "A memorandum of Werther’s upon this point, expressive of his general\nfeelings toward Albert, has been found amongst his papers.",
        "“What is the use of my continually repeating that he is a good and\nestimable man? He is an inward torment to me, and I am incapable\nof being just toward him.”",
        "One fine evening in winter, when the weather seemed inclined to\nthaw, Charlotte and Albert were returning home together. The\nformer looked from time to time about her, as if she missed Werther’s\ncompany. Albert began to speak of him, and censured him for his\nprejudices. He alluded to his unfortunate attachment, and wished\nit were possible to discontinue his acquaintance. “I desire it on\nour own account,” he added; “and I request you will compel him to\nalter his deportment toward you, and to visit you less frequently.\nThe world is censorious, and I know that here and there we are\nspoken of.” Charlotte made no reply, and Albert seemed to feel\nher silence. At least, from that time he never again spoke of\nWerther; and, when she introduced the subject, he allowed the\nconversation to die away, or else he directed the discourse into\nanother channel.",
        "The vain attempt Werther had made to save the unhappy murderer was\nthe last feeble glimmering of a flame about to be extinguished.\nHe sank almost immediately afterward into a state of gloom and\ninactivity, until he was at length brought to perfect distraction\nby learning that he was to be summoned as a witness against the\nprisoner, who asserted his complete innocence.",
        "His mind now became oppressed by the recollection of every misfortune\nof his past life. The mortification he had suffered at the\nambassador’s, and his subsequent troubles, were revived in his\nmemory. He became utterly inactive. Destitute of energy, he was\ncut off from every pursuit and occupation which compose the business\nof common life; and he became a victim to his own susceptibility,\nand to his restless passion for the most amiable and beloved of\nwomen, whose peace he destroyed. In this unvarying monotony of\nexistence his days were consumed; and his powers became exhausted\nwithout aim or design, until they brought him to a sorrowful end.",
        "A few letters which he left behind, and which we here subjoin,\nafford the best proofs of his anxiety of mind and of the depth\nof his passion, as well as of his doubts and struggles, and of\nhis weariness of life.",
        "Dear Wilhelm, I am reduced to the condition of those unfortunate\nwretches who believe they are pursued by an evil spirit. Sometimes\nI am oppressed, not by apprehension or fear, but by an inexpressible\ninternal sensation, which weighs upon my heart, and impedes my\nbreath! Then I wander forth at night, even in this tempestuous\nseason, and feel pleasure in surveying the dreadful scenes around\nme.",
        "Yesterday evening I went forth. A rapid thaw had suddenly set\nin: I had been informed that the river had risen, that the brooks\nhad all overflowed their banks, and that the whole vale of Walheim\nwas under water! Upon the stroke of twelve I hastened forth. I\nbeheld a fearful sight. The foaming torrents rolled from the\nmountains in the moonlight, — fields and meadows, trees and\nhedges, were confounded together; and the entire valley was\nconverted into a deep lake, which was agitated by the roaring\nwind! And when the moon shone forth, and tinged the black clouds\nwith silver, and the impetuous torrent at my feet foamed and resounded\nwith awful and grand impetuosity, I was overcome by a mingled sensation\nof apprehension and delight. With extended arms I looked down into\nthe yawning abyss, and cried, “Plunge!’” For a moment my senses\nforsook me, in the intense delight of ending my sorrows and my\nsufferings by a plunge into that gulf! And then I felt as if I\nwere rooted to the earth, and incapable of seeking an end to my\nwoes! But my hour is not yet come: I feel it is not. O Wilhelm,\nhow willingly could I abandon my existence to ride the whirlwind,\nor to embrace the torrent! and then might not rapture perchance be\nthe portion of this liberated soul?",
        "I turned my sorrowful eyes toward a favourite spot, where I was\naccustomed to sit with Charlotte beneath a willow after a fatiguing\nwalk. Alas! it was covered with water, and with difficulty I found\neven the meadow. And the fields around the hunting-lodge, thought\nI. Has our dear bower been destroyed by this unpitying storm?\nAnd a beam of past happiness streamed upon me, as the mind of a\ncaptive is illumined by dreams of flocks and herds and bygone joys\nof home! But I am free from blame. I have courage to die! Perhaps\nI have, — but I still sit here, like a wretched pauper, who collects\nfagots, and begs her bread from door to door, that she may prolong\nfor a few days a miserable existence which she is unwilling to resign.",
        "What is the matter with me, dear Wilhelm? I am afraid of myself!\nIs not my love for her of the purest, most holy, and most brotherly\nnature? Has my soul ever been sullied by a single sensual desire?\nbut I will make no protestations. And now, ye nightly visions,\nhow truly have those mortals understood you, who ascribe your\nvarious contradictory effects to some invincible power! This night\nI tremble at the avowal — I held her in my arms, locked in a close\nembrace: I pressed her to my bosom, and covered with countless\nkisses those dear lips which murmured in reply soft protestations\nof love. My sight became confused by the delicious intoxication\nof her eyes. Heavens! is it sinful to revel again in such happiness,\nto recall once more those rapturous moments with intense delight?\nCharlotte! Charlotte! I am lost! My senses are bewildered, my\nrecollection is confused, mine eyes are bathed in tears — I am\nill; and yet I am well — I wish for nothing — I have no desires\n— it were better I were gone.",
        "Under the circumstances narrated above, a determination to quit\nthis world had now taken fixed possession of Werther’s soul. Since\nCharlotte’s return, this thought had been the final object of all\nhis hopes and wishes; but he had resolved that such a step should\nnot be taken with precipitation, but with calmness and tranquillity,\nand with the most perfect deliberation.",
        "His troubles and internal struggles may be understood from the\nfollowing fragment, which was found, without any date, amongst\nhis papers, and appears to have formed the beginning of a letter\nto Wilhelm.",
        "“Her presence, her fate, her sympathy for me, have power still to\nextract tears from my withered brain.",
        "“One lifts up the curtain, and passes to the other side, — that\nis all! And why all these doubts and delays? Because we know not\nwhat is behind — because there is no returning — and because our\nmind infers that all is darkness and confusion, where we have\nnothing but uncertainty.”",
        "His appearance at length became quite altered by the effect of\nhis melancholy thoughts; and his resolution was now finally and\nirrevocably taken, of which the following ambiguous letter, which\nhe addressed to his friend, may appear to afford some proof.",
        "I am grateful to your love, Wilhelm, for having repeated your\nadvice so seasonably. Yes, you are right: it is undoubtedly\nbetter that I should depart. But I do not entirely approve your\nscheme of returning at once to your neighbourhood; at least, I\nshould Iike to make a little excursion on the way, particularly\nas we may now expect a continued frost, and consequently good\nroads. I am much pleased with your intention of coming to fetch\nme; only delay your journey for a fortnight, and wait for another\nletter from me. One should gather nothing before it is ripe, and\na fortnight sooner or later makes a great difference. Entreat my\nmother to pray for her son, and tell her I beg her pardon for all\nthe unhappiness I have occasioned her. It has ever been my fate\nto give pain to those whose happiness I should have promoted.\nAdieu, my dearest friend. May every blessing of Heaven attend\nyou! Farewell.",
        "We find it difficult to express the emotions with which Charlotte’s\nsoul was agitated during the whole of this time, whether in relation\nto her husband or to her unfortunate friend; although we are enabled,\nby our knowledge of her character, to understand their nature.",
        "It is certain that she had formed a determination, by every means\nin her power to keep Werther at a distance; and, if she hesitated\nin her decision, it was from a sincere feeling of friendly pity,\nknowing how much it would cost him, indeed, that he would find it\nalmost impossible to comply with her wishes. But various causes\nnow urged her to be firm. Her hushand preserved a strict silence\nabout the whole matter; and she never made it a subject of\nconversation, feeling bound to prove to him by her conduct that\nher sentiments agreed with his.",
        "The same day, which was the Sunday before Christmas, after Werther\nhad written the last-mentioned letter to his friend, he came in\nthe evening to Charlotte’s house, and found her alone. She was\nbusy preparing some little gifts for her brothers and sisters,\nwhich were to be distributed to them on Christmas Day. He began\ntalking of the delight of the children, and of that age when the\nsudden appearance of the Christmas-tree, decorated with fruit and\nsweetmeats, and lighted up with wax candles, causes such transports\nof joy. “You shall have a gift too, if you behave well,” said\nCharlotte, hiding her embarrassment under sweet smile. “And what\ndo you call behaving well? What should I do, what can I do, my\ndear Charlotte?” said he. “Thursday night,” she answered, “is\nChristmas Eve. The children are all to be here, and my father too:\nthere is a present for each; do you come likewise, but do not come\nbefore that time.” Werther started. “I desire you will not: it must\nbe so,” she continued. “I ask it of you as a favour, for my own\npeace and tranquillity. We cannot go on in this manner any longer.\"\nHe turned away his face walked hastily up and down the room, muttering\nindistinctly, “We cannot go on in this manner any longer!” Charlotte,\nseeing the violent agitation into which these words had thrown him,\nendeavoured to divert his thoughts by different questions, but in vain.\n\"No, Charlotte!” he exclaimed; “I will never see you any more!\"\n\"And why so?” she answered. “We may — we must see each other\nagain; only let it be with more discretion. Oh! why were you born\nwith that excessive, that ungovernable passion for everything that\nis dear to you?” Then, taking his hand, she said, “I entreat of\nyou to be more calm: your talents, your understanding, your genius,\nwill furnish you with a thousand resources. Be a man, and conquer\nan unhappy attachment toward a creature who can do nothing but pity\nyou.” He bit his lips, and looked at her with a gloomy countenance.\nShe continued to hold his hand. “Grant me but a moment’s patience,\nWerther,” she said. “Do you not see that you are deceiving yourself,\nthat you are seeking your own destruction? Why must you love me,\nme only, who belong to another? I fear, I much fear, that it is\nonly the impossibility of possessing me which makes your desire for\nme so strong.” He drew back his hand, whilst he surveyed her with\na wild and angry look. “’Tis well!” he exclaimed, “’tis very well!\nDid not Albert furnish you with this reflection? It is profound,\na very profound remark.” “A reflection that any one might easily\nmake,” she answered; “and is there not a woman in the whole world\nwho is at liberty, and has the power to make you happy? Conquer\nyourself: look for such a being, and believe me when I say that you\nwill certainly find her. I have long felt for you, and for us all:\nyou have confined yourself too long within the limits of too narrow\na circle. Conquer yourself; make an effort: a short journey will\nbe of service to you. Seek and find an object worthy of your love;\nthen return hither, and let us enjoy together all the happiness of\nthe most perfect friendship.”",
        "“This speech,” replied Werther with a cold smile, “this speech\nshould be printed, for the benefit of all teachers. My dear\nCharlotte, allow me but a short time longer, and all will be well.\"\n\"But however, Werther,” she added, “do not come again before\nChristmas.” He was about to make some answer, when Albert came in.\nThey saluted each other coldly, and with mutual embarrassment paced\nup and down the room. Werther made some common remarks; Albert\ndid the same, and their conversation soon dropped. Albert asked\nhis wife about some household matters; and, finding that his\ncommissions were not executed, he used some expressions which, to\nWerther’s ear, savoured of extreme harshness. He wished to go,\nbut had not power to move; and in this situation he remained till\neight o’clock, his uneasiness and discontent continually increasing.\nAt length the cloth was laid for supper, and he took up his hat\nand stick. Albert invited him to remain; but Werther, fancying\nthat he was merely paying a formal compliment, thanked him coldly,\namd left the house.",
        "Werther returned home, took the candle from his servant, and retired\nto his room alone. He talked for some time with great earnestness\nto himself, wept aloud, walked in a state of great excitement\nthrough his chamber; till at length, without undressing, he threw\nhimself on the bed, where he was found by his servant at eleven\no’clock, when the latter ventured to enter the room, and take off\nhis boots. Werther did not prevent him, but forbade him to come in\nthe morning till he should ring.",
        "On Monday morning, the 21st of December, he wrote to Charlotte the\nfollowing letter, which was found, sealed, on his bureau after his\ndeath, and was given to her. I shall insert it in fragments; as\nit appears, from several circumstances, to have been written in\nthat manner.",
        "“It is all over, Charlotte: I am resolved to die! I make this\ndeclaration deliberately and coolly, without any romantic passion,\non this morning of the day when I am to see you for the last time.\nAt the moment you read these lines, O best of women, the cold grave\nwill hold the inanimate remains of that restless and unhappy being\nwho, in the last moments of his existence, knew no pleasure so\ngreat as that of conversing with you! I have passed a dreadful\nnight or rather, let me say, a propitious one; for it has given\nme resolution, it has fixed my purpose. I am resolved to die.\nWhen I tore myself from you yesterday, my senses were in tumult\nand disorder; my heart was oppressed, hope and pleasure had fled\nfrom me for ever, and a petrifying cold had seized my wretched\nbeing. I could scarcely reach my room. I threw myself on my knees;\nand Heaven, for the last time, granted me the consolation of\nshedding tears. A thousand ideas, a thousand schemes, arose within\nmy soul; till at length one last, fixed, final thought took\npossession of my heart. It was to die. I lay down to rest; and\nin the morning, in the quiet hour of awakening, the same determination\nwas upon me. To die! It is not despair: it is conviction that I\nhave filled up the measure of my sufferings, that I have reached\nmy appointed term, and must sacrifice myself for thee. Yes,\nCharlotte, why should I not avow it? One of us three must die:\nit shall be Werther. O beloved Charlotte! this heart, excited by\nrage and fury, has often conceived the horrid idea of murdering\nyour husband — you — myself! The lot is cast at length. And\nin the bright, quiet evenings of summer, when you sometimes wander\ntoward the mountains, let your thoughts then turn to me: recollect\nhow often you have watched me coming to meet you from the valley;\nthen bend your eyes upon the churchyard which contains my grave,\nand, by the light of the setting sun, mark how the evening breeze\nwaves the tall grass which grows above my tomb. I was calm when\nI began this letter, but the recollection of these scenes makes\nme weep like a child.”",
        "About ten in the morning, Werther called his servant, and, whilst\nhe was dressing, told him that in a few days he intended to set\nout upon a journey, and bade him therefore lay his clothes in\norder, and prepare them for packing up, call in all his accounts,\nfetch home the books he had lent, and give two months’ pay to the\npoor dependants who were accustomed to receive from him a weekly\nallowance.",
        "He breakfasted in his room, and then mounted his horse, and went\nto visit the steward, who, however, was not at home. He walked\npensively in the garden, and seemed anxious to renew all the ideas\nthat were most painful to him.",
        "The children did not suffer him to remain alone long. They followed\nhim, skipping and dancing before him, and told him, that after\nto-morrow and tomorrow and one day more, they were to receive their\nChristmas gift from Charlotte; and they then recounted all the\nwonders of which they had formed ideas in their child imaginations.\n\"Tomorrow and tomorrow,” said he, “and one day more!” And he\nkissed them tenderly. He was going; but the younger boy stopped\nhim, to whisper something in his ear. He told him that his elder\nbrothers had written splendid New-Year’s wishes so large! one for\npapa, and another for Albert and Charlotte, and one for Werther;\nand they were to be presented early in the morning, on New Year’s\nDay. This quite overcame him. He made each of the children a\npresent, mounted his horse, left his compliments for papa and\nmamma, and, with tears in his eyes, rode away from the place.",
        "He returned home about five o’clock, ordered his servant to keep\nup his fire, desired him to pack his books and linen at the bottom\nof the trunk, and to place his coats at the top. He then appears\nto have made the following addition to the letter addressed to\nCharlotte:",
        "“You do not expect me. You think I will obey you, and not visit\nyou again till Christmas Eve. O Charlotte, today or never! On\nChristmas Eve you will hold this paper in your hand; you will\ntremble, and moisten it with your tears. I will — I must! Oh, how\nhappy I feel to be determined!”",
        "In the meantime, Charlotte was in a pitiable state of mind. After\nher last conversation with Werther, she found how painful to herself\nit would be to decline his visits, and knew how severely he would\nsuffer from their separation.",
        "She had, in conversation with Albert, mentioned casually that Werther\nwould not return before Christmas Eve; and soon afterward Albert\nwent on horseback to see a person in the neighbourhood, with whom\nhe had to transact some business which would detain him all night.",
        "Charlotte was sitting alone. None of her family were near, and\nshe gave herself up to the reflections that silently took possession\nof her mind. She was for ever united to a husband whose love and\nfidelity she had proved, to whom she was heartily devoted, and who\nseemed to be a special gift from Heaven to ensure her happiness.\nOn the other hand, Werther had become dear to her. There was a\ncordial unanimity of sentiment between them from the very first\nhour of their acquaintance, and their long association and repeated\ninterviews had made an indelible impression upon her heart. She\nhad been accustomed to communicate to him every thought and feeling\nwhich interested her, and his absence threatened to open a void\nin her existence which it might be impossible to fill. How heartily\nshe wished that she might change him into her brother, — that she\ncould induce him to marry one of her own friends, or could reestablish\nhis intimacy with Albert.",
        "She passed all her intimate friends in review before her mind, but\nfound something objectionable in each, and could decide upon none\nto whom she would consent to give him.",
        "Amid all these considerations she felt deeply but indistinctly\nthat her own real but unexpressed wish was to retain him for herself,\nand her pure and amiable heart felt from this thought a sense of\noppression which seemed to forbid a prospect of happiness. She\nwas wretched: a dark cloud obscured her mental vision.",
        "It was now half-past six o’clock, and she heard Werther’s step on\nthe stairs. She at once recognised his voice, as he inquired if\nshe were at home. Her heart beat audibly — we could almost say\nfor the first time — at his arrival. It was too late to deny\nherself; and, as he entered, she exclaimed, with a sort of ill\nconcealed confusion, “You have not kept your word!” “I promised\nnothing,” he answered. “But you should have complied, at least\nfor my sake,” she continued. “ I implore you, for both our sakes.”",
        "She scarcely knew what she said or did; and sent for some friends,\nwho, by their presence, might prevent her being left alone with\nWerther. He put down some books he had brought with him, then\nmade inquiries about some others, until she began to hope that her\nfriends might arrive shortly, entertaining at the same time a\ndesire that they might stay away.",
        "At one moment she felt anxious that the servant should remain in\nthe adjoining room, then she changed her mind. Werther, meanwhile,\nwalked impatiently up and down. She went to the piano, and\ndetermined not to retire. She then collected her thoughts, and\nsat down quietly at Werther’s side, who had taken his usual place\non the sofa.",
        "“Have you brought nothing to read?” she inquired. He had nothing.\n\"There in my drawer,” she continued, “you will find your own\ntranslation of some of the songs of Ossian. I have not yet read\nthem, as I have still hoped to hear you recite them; but, for some\ntime past, I have not been able to accomplish such a wish.” He\nsmiled, and went for the manuscript, which he took with a shudder.\nHe sat down; and, with eyes full of tears, he began to read.",
        "“Star of descending night! fair is thy light in the west! thou\nliftest thy unshorn head from thy cloud; thy steps are stately on\nthy hill. What dost thou behold in the plain? The stormy winds\nare laid. The murmur of the torrent comes from afar. Roaring\nwaves climb the distant rock. The flies of evening are on their\nfeeble wings: the hum of their course is on the field. What dost\nthou behold, fair light? But thou dost smile and depart. The\nwaves come with joy around thee: they bathe thy lovely hair.\nFarewell, thou silent beam! Let the light of Ossian’s soul arise!",
        "“And it does arise in its strength! I behold my departed friends.\nTheir gathering is on Lora, as in the days of other years. Fingal\ncomes like a watery column of mist! his heroes are around: and\nsee the bards of song, gray-haired Ullin! stately Ryno! Alpin with\nthe tuneful voice: the soft complaint of Minona! How are ye changed,\nmy friends, since the days of Selma’s feast! when we contended,\nlike gales of spring as they fly along the hill, and bend by turns\nthe feebly whistling grass.",
        "“Minona came forth in her beauty, with downcast look and tearful\neye. Her hair was flying slowly with the blast that rushed\nunfrequent from the hill. The souls of the heroes were sad when\nshe raised the tuneful voice. Oft had they seen the grave of\nSalgar, the dark dwelling of white-bosomed Colma. Colma left alone\non the hill with all her voice of song! Salgar promised to come!\nbut the night descended around. Hear the voice of Colma, when she\nsat alone on the hill!",
        "“Colma. It is night: I am alone, forlorn on the hill of storms.\nThe wind is heard on the mountain. The torrent is howling down\nthe rock. No hut receives me from the rain: forlorn on the hill\nof winds!",
        "“Rise moon! from behind thy clouds. Stars of the night, arise!\nLead me, some light, to the place where my love rests from the\nchase alone! His bow near him unstrung, his dogs panting around\nhim! But here I must sit alone by the rock of the mossy stream.\nThe stream and the wind roar aloud. I hear not the voice of my\nlove! Why delays my Salgar; why the chief of the hill his promise?\nHere is the rock and here the tree! here is the roaring stream!\nThou didst promise with night to be here. Ah! whither is my Salgar\ngone? With thee I would fly from my father, with thee from my\nbrother of pride. Our race have long been foes: we are not foes,\nO Salgar!",
        "“Cease a little while, O wind! stream, be thou silent awhile! let\nmy voice be heard around! let my wanderer hear me! Salgar! it is\nColma who calls. Here is the tree and the rock. Salgar, my love,\nI am here! Why delayest thou thy coming? Lo! the calm moon comes\nforth. The flood is bright in the vale. The rocks are gray on\nthe steep. I see him not on the brow. His dogs come not before\nhim with tidings of his near approach. Here I must sit alone!",
        "“Who lie on the heath beside me? Are they my love and my brother?\nSpeak to me, O my friends! To Colma they give no reply. Speak\nto me: I am alone! My soul is tormented with fears. Ah, they are\ndead! Their swords are red from the fight. O my brother! my\nbrother! why hast thou slain my Salgar! Why, O Salgar, hast thou\nslain my brother! Dear were ye both to me! what shall I say in\nyour praise? Thou wert fair on the hill among thousands! he was\nterrible in fight! Speak to me! hear my voice! hear me, sons of\nmy love! They are silent! silent for ever! Cold, cold, are their\nbreasts of clay! Oh, from the rock on the hill, from the top of\nthe windy steep, speak, ye ghosts of the dead! Speak, I will not\nbe afraid! Whither are ye gone to rest? In what cave of the hill\nshall I find the departed? No feeble voice is on the gale: no\nanswer half drowned in the storm!",
        "“I sit in my grief: I wait for morning in my tears! Rear the tomb,\nye friends of the dead. Close it not till Colma come. My life\nflies away like a dream. Why should I stay behind? Here shall I\nrest with my friends, by the stream of the sounding rock. When\nnight comes on the hill when the loud winds arise my ghost shall\nstand in the blast, and mourn the death of my friends. The hunter\nshall hear from his booth; he shall fear, but love my voice! For\nsweet shall my voice be for my friends: pleasant were her friends \nto Colma.",
        "“Such was thy song, Minona, softly blushing daughter of Torman.\nOur tears descended for Colma, and our souls were sad! Ullin came\nwith his harp; he gave the song of Alpin. The voice of Alpin was\npleasant, the soul of Ryno was a beam of fire! But they had rested\nin the narrow house: their voice had ceased in Selma! Ullin had\nreturned one day from the chase before the heroes fell. He heard\ntheir strife on the hill: their song was soft, but sad! They\nmourned the fall of Morar, first of mortal men! His soul was like\nthe soul of Fingal: his sword like the sword of Oscar. But he\nfell, and his father mourned: his sister’s eyes were full of tears.\nMinona’s eyes were full of tears, the sister of car-borne Morar.\nShe retired from the song of Ullin, like the moon in the west,\nwhen she foresees the shower, and hides her fair head in a cloud.\nI touched the harp with Ullin: the song of morning rose!",
        "“The wind and the rain are past, calm is the noon of day.\nThe clouds are divided in heaven. Over the green hills flies the\ninconstant sun. Red through the stony vale comes down the stream\nof the hill. Sweet are thy murmurs, O stream! but more sweet is\nthe voice I hear. It is the voice of Alpin, the son of song,\nmourning for the dead! Bent is his head of age: red his tearful\neye. Alpin, thou son of song, why alone on the silent hill? why\ncomplainest thou, as a blast in the wood as a wave on the lonely\nshore?",
        "“My tears, O Ryno! are for the dead my voice for those\nthat have passed away. Tall thou art on the hill; fair among the\nsons of the vale. But thou shalt fall like Morar: the mourner\nshall sit on thy tomb. The hills shall know thee no more: thy bow\nshall lie in thy hall unstrung!",
        "“Thou wert swift, O Morar! as a roe on the desert: terrible as a\nmeteor of fire. Thy wrath was as the storm. Thy sword in battle\nas lightning in the field. Thy voice was as a stream after rain,\nlike thunder on distant hills. Many fell by thy arm: they were\nconsumed in the flames of thy wrath. But when thou didst return\nfrom war, how peaceful was thy brow. Thy face was like the sun\nafter rain: like the moon in the silence of night: calm as the\nbreast of the lake when the loud wind is laid.",
        "“Narrow is thy dwelling now! dark the place of thine abode! With\nthree steps I compass thy grave, O thou who wast so great before!\nFour stones, with their heads of moss, are the only memorial of\nthee. A tree with scarce a leaf, long grass which whistles in the\nwind, mark to the hunter’s eye the grave of the mighty Morar.\nMorar! thou art low indeed. Thou hast no mother to mourn thee,\nno maid with her tears of love. Dead is she that brought thee\nforth. Fallen is the daughter of Morglan.",
        "“Who on his staff is this? Who is this whose head is white with\nage, whose eyes are red with tears, who quakes at every step? It\nis thy father, O Morar! the father of no son but thee. He heard\nof thy fame in war, he heard of foes dispersed. He heard of Morar’s\nrenown, why did he not hear of his wound? Weep, thou father of\nMorar! Weep, but thy son heareth thee not. Deep is the sleep of\nthe dead, low their pillow of dust. No more shall he hear thy\nvoice, no more awake at thy call. When shall it be morn in the\ngrave, to bid the slumberer awake? Farewell, thou bravest of men!\nthou conqueror in the field! but the field shall see thee no more,\nnor the dark wood be lightened with the splendour of thy steel.\nThou has left no son. The song shall preserve thy name. Future\ntimes shall hear of thee they shall hear of the fallen Morar!",
        "“The grief of all arose, but most the bursting sigh of Armin. He\nremembers the death of his son, who fell in the days of his youth.\nCarmor was near the hero, the chief of the echoing Galmal. Why\nburst the sigh of Armin? he said. Is there a cause to mourn? The\nsong comes with its music to melt and please the soul. It is like\nsoft mist that, rising from a lake, pours on the silent vale;\nthe green flowers are filled with dew, but the sun returns in his\nstrength, and the mist is gone. Why art thou sad, O Armin, chief\nof sea-surrounded Gorma?",
        "“Sad I am! nor small is my cause of woe! Carmor, thou hast lost\nno son; thou hast lost no daughter of beauty. Colgar the valiant\nlives, and Annira, fairest maid. The boughs of thy house ascend,\nO Carmor! but Armin is the last of his race. Dark is thy bed, O\nDaura! deep thy sleep in the tomb! When shalt thou wake with thy\nsongs? with all thy voice of music?",
        "“Arise, winds of autumn, arise: blow along the heath. Streams of\nthe mountains, roar; roar, tempests in the groves of my oaks! Walk\nthrough broken clouds, O moon! show thy pale face at intervals;\nbring to my mind the night when all my children fell, when Arindal\nthe mighty fell — when Daura the lovely failed. Daura, my daughter,\nthou wert fair, fair as the moon on Fura, white as the driven snow,\nsweet as the breathing gale. Arindal, thy bow was strong, thy spear\nwas swift on the field, thy look was like mist on the wave, thy\nshield a red cloud in a storm! Armar, renowned in war, came and\nsought Daura’s love. He was not long refused: fair was the hope\nof their friends.",
        "“Erath, son of Odgal, repined: his brother had been slain by Armar.\nHe came disguised like a son of the sea: fair was his cliff on the\nwave, white his locks of age, calm his serious brow. Fairest of\nwomen, he said, lovely daughter of Armin! a rock not distant in\nthe sea bears a tree on its side; red shines the fruit afar. There\nArmar waits for Daura. I come to carry his love! she went she\ncalled on Armar. Nought answered, but the son of the rock. Armar,\nmy love, my love! why tormentest thou me with fear? Hear, son of\nArnart, hear! it is Daura who calleth thee. Erath, the traitor,\nfled laughing to the land. She lifted up her voice— she called\nfor her brother and her father. Arindal! Armin! none to relieve\nyou, Daura.",
        "“Her voice came over the sea. Arindal, my son, descended from the\nhill, rough in the spoils of the chase. His arrows rattled by his\nside; his bow was in his hand, five dark-gray dogs attended his\nsteps. He saw fierce Erath on the shore; he seized and bound him\nto an oak. Thick wind the thongs of the hide around his limbs;\nhe loads the winds with his groans. Arindal ascends the deep in\nhis boat to bring Daura to land. Armar came in his wrath, and\nlet fly the gray-feathered shaft. It sung, it sunk in thy heart,\nO Arindal, my son! for Erath the traitor thou diest. The oar is\nstopped at once: he panted on the rock, and expired. What is thy\ngrief, O Daura, when round thy feet is poured thy brother’s blood.\nThe boat is broken in twain. Armar plunges into the sea to rescue\nhis Daura, or die. Sudden a blast from a hill came over the waves;\nhe sank, and he rose no more.",
        "“Alone, on the sea-beat rock, my daughter was heard to complain;\nfrequent and loud were her cries. What could her father do? All\nnight I stood on the shore: I saw her by the faint beam of the moon.\nAll night I heard her cries. Loud was the wind; the rain beat hard\non the hill. Before morning appeared, her voice was weak; it died\naway like the evening breeze among the grass of the rocks. Spent\nwith grief, she expired, and left thee, Armin, alone. Gone is my\nstrength in war, fallen my pride among women. When the storms\naloft arise, when the north lifts the wave on high, I sit by the\nsounding shore, and look on the fatal rock.",
        "“Often by the setting moon I see the ghosts of my children; half\nviewless they walk in mournful conference together.”",
        "A torrent of tears which streamed from Charlotte’s eyes and gave\nrelief to her bursting heart, stopped Werther’s recitation. He\nthrew down the book, seized her hand, and wept bitterly. Charlotte\nleaned upon her hand, and buried her face in her handkerchief:\nthe agitation of both was excessive. They felt that their own\nfate was pictured in the misfortunes of Ossian’s heroes, they\nfelt this together, and their tears redoubled. Werther supported\nhis forehead on Charlotte’s arm: she trembled, she wished to be\ngone; but sorrow and sympathy lay like a leaden weight upon her\nsoul. She recovered herself shortly, and begged Werther, with\nbroken sobs, to leave her, implored him with the utmost earnestness\nto comply with her request. He trembled; his heart was ready to\nburst: then, taking up the book again, he recommenced reading, in\na voice broken by sobs.",
        "“Why dost thou waken me, O spring? Thy voice woos me, exclaiming,\nI refresh thee with heavenly dews; but the time of my decay is\napproaching, the storm is nigh that shall whither my leaves.\nTomorrow the traveller shall come, he shall come, who beheld me\nin beauty: his eye shall seek me in the field around, but he shall\nnot find me.”",
        "The whole force of these words fell upon the unfortunate Werther.\nFull of despair, he threw himself at Charlotte’s feet, seized her\nhands, and pressed them to his eyes and to his forehead. An\napprehension of his fatal project now struck her for the first\ntime. Her senses were bewildered: she held his hands, pressed\nthem to her bosom; and, leaning toward him with emotions of the\ntenderest pity, her warm cheek touched his. They lost sight of\neverything. The world disappeared from their eyes. He clasped\nher in his arms, strained her to his bosom, and covered her trembling\nlips with passionate kisses. “Werther!” she cried with a faint\nvoice, turning herself away; “Werther!” and, with a feeble hand,\nshe pushed him from her. At length, with the firm voice of virtue,\nshe exclaimed, “Werther!” He resisted not, but, tearing himself\nfrom her arms, fell on his knees before her. Charlotte rose, and,\nwith disordered grief, in mingled tones of love and resentment,\nshe exclaimed, “It is the last time, Werther! You shall never see\nme any more!” Then, casting one last, tender look upon her\nunfortunate lover, she rushed into the adjoining room, and locked\nthe door. Werther held out his arms, but did not dare to detain\nher. He continued on the ground, with his head resting on the\nsofa, for half an hour, till he heard a noise which brought him\nto his senses. The servant entered. He then walked up and down\nthe room; and, when he was again left alone, he went to Charlotte’s\ndoor, and, in a low voice, said, “Charlotte, Charlotte! but one\nword more, one last adieu!” She returned no answer. He stopped,\nand listened and entreated; but all was silent. At length he tore\nhimself from the place, crying, “Adieu, Charlotte, adieu for ever!”",
        "Werther ran to the gate of the town. The guards, who knew him,\nlet him pass in silence. The night was dark and stormy, — it\nrained and snowed. He reached his own door about eleven. His\nservant, although seeing him enter the house without his hat, did\nnot venture to say anything; and; as he undressed his master, he\nfound that his clothes were wet. His hat was afterward found on\nthe point of a rock overhanging the valley; and it is inconceivable\nhow he could have climbed to the summit on such a dark, tempestuous\nnight without losing his life.",
        "He retired to bed, and slept to a late hour. The next morning his\nservant, upon being called to bring his coffee, found him writing.\nHe was adding, to Charlotte, what we here annex.",
        "“For the last, last time I open these eyes. Alas! they will behold\nthe sun no more. It is covered by a thick, impenetrable cloud.\nYes, Nature! put on mourning: your child, your friend, your lover,\ndraws near his end! This thought, Charlotte, is without parallel;\nand yet it seems like a mysterious dream when I repeat — this is\nmy last day! The last! Charlotte, no word can adequately express\nthis thought. The last! To-day I stand erect in all my strength\nto-morrow, cold and stark, I shall lie extended upon the ground.\nTo die! what is death? We do but dream in our discourse upon it.\nI have seen many human beings die; but, so straitened is our feeble\nnature, we have no clear conception of the beginning or the end\nof our existence. At this moment I am my own — or rather I am\nthine, thine, my adored! and the next we are parted, severed —\nperhaps for ever! No, Charlotte, no! How can I, how can you,\nbe annihilated? We exist. What is annihilation? A mere word,\nan unmeaning sound that fixes no impression on the mind. Dead,\nCharlotte! laid in the cold earth, in the dark and narrow grave!\nI had a friend once who was everything to me in early youth.\nShe died. I followed her hearse; I stood by her grave when the\ncoffin was lowered; and when I heard the creaking of the cords\nas they were loosened and drawn up, when the first shovelful\nof earth was thrown in, and the coffin returned a hollow sound,\nwhich grew fainter and fainter till all was completely covered\nover, I threw myself on the ground; my heart was smitten, grieved,\nshattered, rent — but I neither knew what had happened, nor what\nwas to happen to me. Death! the grave! I understand not the words.\n— Forgive, oh, forgive me! Yesterday — ah, that day should have\nbeen the last of my life! Thou angel! for the first time in my\nexistence, I felt rapture glow within my inmost soul. She loves,\nshe loves me! Still burns upon my lips the sacred fire they\nreceived from thine. New torrents of delight overwhelm my soul.\nForgive me, oh, forgive!",
        "“I knew that I was dear to you; I saw it in your first entrancing\nlook, knew it by the first pressure of your hand; but when I was\nabsent from you, when I saw Albert at your side, my doubts and\nfears returned.",
        "“Do you remember the flowers you sent me, when, at that crowded\nassembly, you could neither speak nor extend your hand to me?\nHalf the night I was on my knees before those flowers, and I\nregarded them as the pledges of your love; but those impressions\ngrew fainter, and were at length effaced.",
        "“Everything passes away; but a whole eternity could not extinguish\nthe living flame which was yesterday kindled by your lips, and\nwhich now burns within me. She loves me! These arms have encircled\nher waist, these lips have trembled upon hers. She is mine! Yes,\nCharlotte, you are mine for ever!",
        "“And what do they mean by saying Albert is your husband? He may\nbe so for this world; and in this world it is a sin to love you,\nto wish to tear you from his embrace. Yes, it is a crime; and I\nsuffer the punishment, but I have enjoyed the full delight of\nmy sin. I have inhaled a balm that has revived my soul. From\nthis hour you are mine; yes, Charlotte, you are mine! I go\nbefore you. I go to my Father and to your Father. I will pour\nout my sorrows before him, and he will give me comfort till you\narrive. Then will I fly to meet you. I will claim you, and\nremain your eternal embrace, in the presence of the Almighty.",
        "“I do not dream, I do not rave. Drawing nearer to the grave my\nperceptions become clearer. We shall exist; we shall see each\nother again; we shall behold your mother; I shall behold her, and\nexpose to her my inmost heart. Your mother — your image!”",
        "About eleven o’clock Werther asked his servant if Albert had\nreturned. He answered, “Yes;” for he had seen him pass on horseback:\nupon which Werther sent him the following note, unsealed:",
        "“Be so good as to lend me your pistols for a journey. Adieu.”",
        "Charlotte had slept little during the past night. All her\napprehensions were realised in a way that she could neither\nforesee nor avoid. Her blood was boiling in her veins, and a\nthousand painful sensations rent her pure heart. Was it the\nardour of Werther’s passionate embraces that she felt within her\nbosom? Was it anger at his daring? Was it the sad comparison\nof her present condition with former days of innocence, tranquillity,\nand self-confidence? How could she approach her husband, and\nconfess a scene which she had no reason to conceal, and which she\nyet felt, nevertheless, unwilling to avow? They had preserved so\nlong a silence toward each other and should she be the first to\nbreak it by so unexpected a discovery? She feared that the mere\nstatement of Werther’s visit would trouble him, and his distress\nwould be heightened by her perfect candour. She wished that he\ncould see her in her true light, and judge her without prejudice;\nbut was she anxious that he should read her inmost soul? On the\nother hand, could she deceive a being to whom all her thoughts\nhad ever been exposed as clearly as crystal, and from whom no\nsentiment had ever been concealed? These reflections made her\nanxious and thoughtful. Her mind still dwelt on Werther, who was\nnow lost to her, but whom she could not bring herself to resign,\nand for whom she knew nothing was left but despair if she should\nbe lost to him for ever.",
        "A recollection of that mysterious estrangement which had lately\nsubsisted between herself and Albert, and which she could never\nthoroughly understand, was now beyond measure painful to her.\nEven the prudent and the good have before now hesitated to explain\ntheir mutual differences, and have dwelt in silence upon their\nimaginary grievances, until circumstances have become so entangled,\nthat in that critical juncture, when a calm explanation would\nhave saved all parties, an understanding was impossible. And\nthus if domestic confidence had been earlier established between\nthem, if love and kind forbearance had mutually animated and\nexpanded their hearts, it might not, perhaps, even yet have been\ntoo late to save our friend.",
        "But we must not forget one remarkable circumstance. We may\nobserve from the character of Werther’s correspondence, that\nhe had never affected to conceal his anxious desire to quit\nthis world. He had often discussed the subject with Albert;\nand, between the latter and Charlotte, it had not unfrequently\nformed a topic of conversation. Albert was so opposed to the very\nidea of such an action, that, with a degree of irritation unusual\nin him, he had more than once given Werther to understand that he\ndoubted the seriousness of his threats, and not only turned them\ninto ridicule, but caused Charlotte to share his feelings of\nincredulity. Her heart was thus tranquillised when she felt\ndisposed to view the melancholy subject in a serious point of\nview, though she never communicated to her husband the\napprehensions she sometimes experienced.",
        "Albert, upon his return, was received by Charlotte with\nill-concealed embarrassment. He was himself out of humour; his\nbusiness was unfinished; and he had just discovered that the\nneighbouring official with whom he had to deal, was an obstinate\nand narrow-minded personage. Many things had occurred to irritate\nhim.",
        "He inquired whether anything had happened during his absence, and\nCharlotte hastily answered that Werther had been there on the\nevening previously. He then inquired for his letters, and was\nanswered that several packages had been left in his study. He\nthereon retired, leaving Charlotte alone.",
        "The presence of the being she loved and honoured produced a new\nimpression on her heart. The recollection of his generosity,\nkindness, and affection had calmed her agitation: a secret impulse\nprompted her to follow him; she took her work and went to his\nstudy, as was often her custom. He was busily employed opening\nand reading his letters. It seemed as if the contents of some\nwere disagreeable. She asked some questions: he gave short answers,\nand sat down to write.",
        "Several hours passed in this manner, and Charlotte’s feelings\nbecame more and more melancholy. She felt the extreme difficulty\nof explaining to her husband, under any circumstances, the weight\nthat lay upon her heart; and her depression became every moment\ngreater, in proportion as she endeavoured to hide her grief, and\nto conceal her tears.",
        "The arrival of Werther’s servant occasioned her the greatest\nembarrassment. He gave Albert a note, which the latter coldly\nhanded to his wife, saying, at the same time, “Give him the pistols.\nI wish him a pleasant journey,” he added, turning to the servant.\nThese words fell upon Charlotte like a thunderstroke: she rose\nfrom her seat half-fainting, and unconscious of what she did. She\nwalked mechanically toward the wall, took down the pistols with a\ntrembling hand, slowly wiped the dust from them, and would have\ndelayed longer, had not Albert hastened her movements by an impatient\nlook. She then delivered the fatal weapons to the servant, without\nbeing able to utter a word. As soon as he had departed, she folded\nup her work, and retired at once to her room, her heart overcome\nwith the most fearful forebodings. She anticipated some dreadful\ncalamity. She was at one moment on the point of going to her\nhusband, throwing herself at his feet, and acquainting him with\nall that had happened on the previous evening, that she might\nacknowledge her fault, and explain her apprehensions; then she saw\nthat such a step would be useless, as she would certainly be unable\nto induce Albert to visit Werther. Dinner was served; and a kind\nfriend whom she had persuaded to remain assisted to sustain the\nconversation, which was carried on by a sort of compulsion, till\nthe events of the morning were forgotten.",
        "When the servant brought the pistols to Werther, the latter received\nthem with transports of delight upon hearing that Charlotte had\ngiven them to him with her own hand. He ate some bread, drank\nsome wine, sent his servant to dinner, and then sat down to write\nas follows:",
        "“They have been in your hands you wiped the dust from them. I\nkiss them a thousand times — you have touched them. Yes, Heaven\nfavours my design, and you, Charlotte, provide me with the fatal\ninstruments. It was my desire to receive my death from your hands,\nand my wish is gratified. I have made inquiries of my servant.\nYou trembled when you gave him the pistols, but you bade me no\nadieu. Wretched, wretched that I am — not one farewell! How\ncould you shut your heart against me in that hour which makes you\nmine for ever? Charlotte, ages cannot efface the impression — I\nfeel you cannot hate the man who so passionately loves you!”",
        "After dinner he called his servant, desired him to finish the\npacking up, destroyed many papers, and then went out to pay some\ntrifling debts. He soon returned home, then went out again,\nnotwithstanding the rain, walked for some time in the count’s\ngarden, and afterward proceeded farther into the country. Toward\nevening he came back once more, and resumed his writing.",
        "“Wilhelm, I have for the last time beheld the mountains, the forests,\nand the sky. Farewell! And you, my dearest mother, forgive me!\nConsole her, Wilhelm. God bless you! I have settled all my\naffairs! Farewell! We shall meet again, and be happier than ever.”",
        "“I have requited you badly, Albert; but you will forgive me. I\nhave disturbed the peace of your home. I have sowed distrust\nbetween you. Farewell! I will end all this wretchedness. And\noh, that my death may render you happy! Albert, Albert! make that\nangel happy, and the blessing of Heaven be upon you!”",
        "He spent the rest of the evening in arranging his papers: he tore\nand burned a great many; others he sealed up, and directed to\nWilhelm. They contained some detached thoughts and maxims, some\nof which I have perused. At ten o’clock he ordered his fire to\nbe made up, and a bottle of wine to be brought to him. He then\ndismissed his servant, whose room, as well as the apartments of\nthe rest of the family, was situated in another part of the house.\nThe servant lay down without undressing, that he might be the\nsooner ready for his journey in the morning, his master having\ninformed him that the post-horses would be at the door before six\no’clock.",
        "“Past eleven o’clock! All is silent around me, and my soul is\ncalm. I thank thee, O God, that thou bestowest strength and courage\nupon me in these last moments! I approach the window, my dearest\nof friends; and through the clouds, which are at this moment driven\nrapidly along by the impetuous winds, I behold the stars which\nillumine the eternal heavens. No, you will not fall, celestial\nbodies: the hand of the Almighty supports both you and me! I have\nlooked for the last time upon the constellation of the Greater\nBear: it is my favourite star; for when I bade you farewell at\nnight, Charlotte, and turned my steps from your door, it always\nshone upon me. With what rapture have I at times beheld it! How\noften have I implored it with uplifted hands to witness my felicity!\nand even still — But what object is there, Charlotte, which fails\nto summon up your image before me? Do you not surround me on all\nsides? and have I not, like a child, treasured up every trifle\nwhich you have consecrated by your touch?",
        "“Your profile, which was so dear to me, I return to you; and I\npray you to preserve it. Thousands of kisses have I imprinted\nupon it, and a thousand times has it gladdened my heart on departing\nfrom and returning to my home.",
        "“I have implored your father to protect my remains. At the corner\nof the churchyard, looking toward the fields, there are two\nlime-trees — there I wish to lie. Your father can, and doubtless\nwill, do this much for his friend. Implore it of him. But perhaps\npious Christians will not choose that their bodies chould be\nburied near the corpse of a poor, unhappy wretch like me. Then\nlet me be laid in some remote valley, or near the highway, where\nthe priest and Levite may bless themselves as they pass by my\ntomb, whilst the Samaritan will shed a tear for my fate.",
        "“See, Charlotte, I do not shudder to take the cold and fatal cup,\nfrom which I shall drink the draught of death. Your hand presents\nit to me, and I do not tremble. All, all is now concluded: the\nwishes and the hopes of my existence are fulfilled. With cold,\nunflinching hand I knock at the brazen portals of Death. Oh, that\nI had enjoyed the bliss of dying for you! how gladly would I have\nsacrificed myself for you; Charlotte! And could I but restore\npeace and joy to your bosom, with what resolution, with what joy,\nwould I not meet my fate! But it is the lot of only a chosen few\nto shed their blood for their friends, and by their death to\naugment, a thousand times, the happiness of those by whom they are\nbeloved.",
        "I wish, Charlotte, to be buried in the dress I wear at present:\nit has been rendered sacred by your touch. I have begged this\nfavour of your father. My spirit soars above my sepulchre. I\ndo not wish my pockets to be searched. The knot of pink ribbon\nwhich you wore on your bosom the first time I saw you, surrounded\nby the children — Oh, kiss them a thousand times for me, and\ntell them the fate of their unhappy friend! I think I see them\nplaying around me. The dear children! How warmly have I been\nattached to you, Charlotte! Since the first hour I saw you, how\nimpossible have I found it to leave you. This ribbon must be\nburied with me: it was a present from you on my birthday. How\nconfused it all appears! Little did I then think that I should\njourney this road. But peace! I pray you, peace!",
        "“They are loaded — the clock strikes twelve. I say amen.\nCharlotte, Charlotte! farewell, farewell!”",
        "A neighbour saw the flash, and heard the report of the pistol;\nbut, as everything remained quiet, he thought no more of it.",
        "In the morning, at six o’clock, the servant went into Werther’s\nroom with a candle. He found his master stretched upon the floor,\nweltering in his blood, and the pistols at his side. He called,\nhe took him in his arms, but received no answer. Life was not yet\nquite extinct. The servant ran for a surgeon, and then went to\nfetch Albert. Charlotte heard the ringing of the bell: a cold\nshudder seized her. She wakened her husband, and they both rose.\nThe servant, bathed in tears faltered forth the dreadful news.\nCharlotte fell senseless at Albert’s feet.",
        "When the surgeon came to the unfortunate Werther, he was still\nlying on the floor; and his pulse beat, but his limbs were cold.\nThe bullet, entering the forehead, over the right eye, had\npenetrated the skull. A vein was opened in his right arm: the\nblood came, and he still continued to breathe.",
        ">From the blood which flowed from the chair, it could be inferred\nthat he had committed the rash act sitting at his bureau, and that\nhe afterward fell upon the floor. He was found lying on his back\nnear the window. He was in full-dress costume.",
        "The house, the neighbourhood, and the whole town were immediately\nin commotion. Albert arrived. They had laid Werther on the bed:\nhis head was bound up, and the paleness of death was upon his face.\nHis limbs were motionless; but he still breathed, at one time\nstrongly, then weaker — his death was momently expected.",
        "He had drunk only one glass of the wine. “Emilia Galotti” lay\nopen upon his bureau.",
        "I shall say nothing of Albert’s distress, or of Charlotte’s grief.",
        "The old steward hastened to the house immediately upon hearing the\nnews: he embraced his dying friend amid a flood of tears. His\neldest boys soon followed him on foot. In speechless sorrow they\nthrew themselves on their knees by the bedside, and kissed his\nhands and face. The eldest, who was his favourite, hung over him\ntill he expired; and even then he was removed by force. At twelve\no’clock Werther breathed his last. The presence of the steward,\nand the precautions he had adopted, prevented a disturbance; and\nthat night, at the hour of eleven, he caused the body to be interred\nin the place which Werther had selected for himself.",
        "The steward and his sons followed the corpse to the grave. Albert\nwas unable to accompany them. Charlotte’s life was despaired of.\nThe body was carried by labourers. No priest attended.",
