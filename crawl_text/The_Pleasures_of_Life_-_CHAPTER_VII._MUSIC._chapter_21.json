        "    “Music is a moral law. It gives a soul to the universe, wings to the\n    mind, flight to the imagination, a charm to sadness, gaiety and life\n    to everything. It is the essence of order, and leads to all that is\n    good, just, and beautiful, of which it is the invisible, but\n    nevertheless dazzling, passionate, and eternal form.\"–PLATO.",
        "Music is in one sense far more ancient than man, and the voice was from\nthe very commencement of human existence a source of melody: but so far as\nmusical instruments are concerned, it is probable that percussion came\nfirst, then wind instruments, and lastly, those with strings: first the\nDrum, then the Flute, and thirdly, the Lyre. The early history of Music\nis, however, unfortunately wrapped in much obscurity. The use of letters\nlong preceded the invention of notes, and tradition in such a matter can\ntell us but little.",
        "The contest between Marsyas and Apollo is supposed by some to typify the\nstruggle between the Flute and the Lyre; Marsyas representing the archaic\nFlute, Apollo the champion of the Lyre. The latter of course was\nvictorious: it sets the voice free, and the sound",
        "  “Of music that is born of human breath\n  Comes straighter to the soul than any strain\n  The hand alone can make.” [1]",
        "Various myths have grown up to explain the origin of Music. One Greek\ntradition was to the effect Grasshoppers were human beings themselves in a\nworld before the Muses; that when the Muses came, being ravished with\ndelight, they sang and sang and forgot to eat, until “they died of hunger\nfor the love of song. And they carry to heaven the report of those who\nhonor them on earth.” [2]",
        "The old writers and commentators tell us that Pythagoras, “as he was one\nday meditating on the want of some rule to guide the ear, analogous to\nwhat had been used to help the other senses, chanced to pass by a\nblacksmith’s shop, and observing that the hammers, which were four in\nnumber, sounded very harmoniously, he had them weighed, and found them to\nbe in the proportion of six, eight, nine, and twelve. Upon this he\nsuspended four strings of equal length and thickness, etc., fastened\nweights in the above-mentioned proportions to each of them respectively,\nand found that they gave the same sounds that the hammers had done; viz.\nthe fourth, fifth, and octave to the gravest tone.” [3] However this may\nbe, it would appear that the lyre had at first four strings only:\nTerpander is said to have given it three more, and an eighth was\nsubsequently added.",
        "We have unfortunately no specimens of Greek or Roman, or even of Early\nChristian music. The Chinese indicated the notes by words or their\ninitials. The lowest was termed “Koung,” or the Emperor, as being the\nFoundation on which all were supported; the second was Tschang, the Prime\nMinister; the third, the Subject; the fourth, Public Business; the fifth,\nthe Mirror of Heaven. [4] The Greeks also had a name for each note. The\nso-called Gregorian notes were not invented until six hundred years after\nGregory’s death. The Monastery of St. Gall possesses a copy of Gregory’s\nAntiphonary, made about the year 780 by a chorister who was sent from Rome\nto Charlemagne to reform the Northern music, and in this the notes are\nindicated by “pneumss,” from which our notes were gradually developed, and\nfirst arranged along one line, to which others were gradually added. But I\nmust not enlarge on this interesting subject.",
        "In the matter of music Englishmen have certainly deserved well of the\nworld. Even as long ago as 1185 Giraldus Cambrensis, Bishop of St.\nDavid’s, says, “The Britons do not sing their tunes in unison like the\ninhabitants of other countries, but in different parts. So that when a\ncompany of singers meet to sing, as is usual in this country, as many\ndifferent parts are heard as there are singers.” [5]",
        "The most ancient known piece of music for several voices is an English\nfour men’s song, “Summer is a coming in,” which is considered to be at\nleast as early as 1240, and is now in the British Museum.",
        "The Venetian Ambassador in the time of Henry VIII. said of our English\nChurch music: “The mass was sung by His Majesty’s choristers, whose voices\nare more heavenly than human; they did not chant like men, but like\nangels.”",
        "Speaking of Purcell’s anthem, “Be merciful to me, O God,” Burney says it\nis “throughout admirable. Indeed, to my conception there is no better\nmusic existing of the kind than the opening of this anthem, in which the\nverse ’I will praise God’ and the last movement in C natural are, in\nmelody, harmony, and modulation, truly divine music.”",
        "Dr. Burney says that Purcell was “as much the pride of an Englishman in\nmusic as Shakespeare in productions of the stage, Milton in epic poetry,\nLocke in metaphysics, or Sir Isaac Newton in philosophy and mathematics;\"\nand yet Purcell’s music is unfortunately but little known to us now, as\nMacfarren says, “to our great loss.”",
        "The authors of some of the loveliest music, and even in some cases that of\ncomparatively recent times, are unknown to us. This is the case for\ninstance with the exquisite song “Drink to me only with thine eyes,” the\nwords of which were taken by Jonson from Philostratus, and which has been\nconsidered as the most beautiful of all “people’s songs.”",
        "The music of “God save the Queen” has been adopted in more than half a\ndozen other countries, and yet the authorship is a matter of doubt, being\nattributed by some to Dr. John Bull, by others to Carey. It was apparently\nfirst sung in a tavern in Cornhill.",
        "Both the music and words of “O Death, rock me to sleep” are said to be by\nAnne Boleyn: “Stay, Corydon” and “Sweet Honey-sucking Bees” by Wildye,\n“the first of madrigal writers.” “Rule Britannia” was composed by Arne,\nand originally formed part of his Masque of Alfred, first performed in\n1740 at Cliefden, near Maidenhead. To Arne we are also indebted for the\nmusic of “Where the Bee sucks there lurk I.” “The Vicar of Bray” is set to\na tune originally known as “A Country Garden.” “Come unto these yellow\nsands” we owe to Purcell; “Sigh no more, Ladies” to Stevens; “Home, Sweet\nHome” to Bishop.",
        "There is a curious melancholy in national music which is generally in the\nminor key; indeed this holds good with the music of savage races\ngenerally. They appear, moreover, to have no love Songs.",
        "Herodotus tells us that during the whole time he was in Egypt he only\nheard one song, and that was a sad one. My own experience there was the\nsame. Some tendency to melancholy seems indeed inherent in music, and\nJessica is not alone in the feeling",
        "  “I am never merry when I hear sweet music.”",
        "The epitaphs on Musicians have been in some cases very well expressed.\nSuch, for instance, is the following:",
        "  “Philips, whose touch harmonious could remove\n  The pangs of guilty power and hapless love,\n  Rest here, distressed by poverty no more;\n  Here find that calm thou gav’st so oft before;\n  Sleep, undisturbed, within this peaceful shrine,\n  Till angels wake thee with a note like thine!”",
        "Still more so that on Purcell, whose premature death was so irreparable a\nloss to English music–",
        "    “Here lies Henry Purcell, who left this life, and is gone to that\n    blessed place, where only his harmony can be exceeded.”",
        "The histories of Music contain many curious anecdotes as to the\ncircumstances under which different works have been composed.",
        "Rossini tells us that he wrote the overture to the “Gazza Ladra” on the\nvery day of the first performance, in the upper loft of the La Scala,\nwhere he had been confined by the manager under the guard of four\nscene-shifters, who threw the text out of the window to copyists bit by\nbit as it was composed. Tartini is said to have composed “Il trillo del\nDiavolo,” considered to be his best work, in a dream. Rossini, speaking of\nthe chorus in G minor in his “Dal tuo stellato soglio,” tells us: “While I\nwas writing the chorus in G minor I suddenly dipped my pen into a medicine\nbottle instead of the ink. I made a blot, and when I dried this with the\nsand it took the form of a natural, which instantly gave me the idea of\nthe effect the change from G minor to G major would make, and to this blot\nis all the effect, if any, due.” But these of course are exceptional\ncases.",
        "There are other forms of Music, which though not strictly entitled to the\nname, are yet capable of giving intense pleasure. To the sportsman what\nMusic can excel that of the hounds themselves. The cawing of rooks has\nbeen often quoted as a sound which has no actual beauty of its own, and\nyet which is delightful from its associations.",
        "There is, however, a true Music of Nature,–the song of birds, the whisper\nof leaves, the ripple of waters upon a sandy shore, the wail of wind or\nsea.",
        "There was also an ancient impression that the Heavenly bodies give out\nmusic as well as light: the Music of the Spheres is proverbial.",
        "  “There’s not the smallest orb which thou beholdest\n  But in his motion like an angel sings,\n  Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims;\n  Such harmony is in immortal souls\n  But while this muddy vesture of decay\n  Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.” [6]",
        "Music indeed often seems as if it scarcely belonged to this material\nuniverse, but was",
        "                      “A tone\n  Of some world far from ours,\n  Where music, and moonlight, and feeling are one.” [7]",
        "There is Music in speech as well as in song. Not merely in the voice of\nthose we love, and the charm of association, but in actual melody; as\nMilton says,",
        "  “The Angel ended, and in Adam’s ear\n  So charming left his voice, that he awhile\n  Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear.”",
        "It is remarkable that more pains are not taken with the voice in\nconversation as well as in singing, for",
        "  “What plea so tainted and corrupt\n  But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,\n  Obscures the show of evil.”",
        "It may be true as a general rule that",
        "  “The man that hath no Music in himself\n  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds\n  Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;” [8]",
        "but there are some notable exceptions. Dr. Johnson had no love of music.\nOn one occasion, hearing that a certain piece of music was very difficult,\nhe expressed his regret that it was not impossible.",
        "Poets, as might have been expected, have sung most sweetly in praise of\nsong. They have, moreover, done so from the most opposite points of view.",
        "Milton invokes it as a luxury–",
        "    “And ever against eating cares\n  Lap me in soft Lydian airs;\n  Married to immortal verse\n  Such as the meeting soul may pierce,\n  In notes with many a winding bout\n  Of linked sweetness long drawn out;\n  With wanton heed, and giddy cunning,\n  The melting voice through mazes running;\n  Untwisting all the chains that tie\n  The hidden soul of harmony.”",
        "Sometimes as a temptation; so Spenser says of Phaedria,",
        "  “And she, more sweet than any bird on bough\n    Would oftentimes amongst them bear a part,\n  And strive to passe (as she could well enough)\n    Their native musicke by her skilful art.”",
        "Or as an element of pure happiness–",
        "  “There is in Souls a sympathy with sounds;\n  And as the mind is pitched, the ear is pleased\n  With melting airs or martial, brisk or grave;\n  Some chord in unison with what we hear\n  Is touched within us, and the heart replies.\n  How soft the music of those village bells,\n  Falling at intervals upon the ear\n  In cadence sweet, now dying all away,\n  Now pealing loud again and louder still\n  Clear and sonorous, as the gale comes on.” [9]",
        "As touching the human heart–",
        "  “The soul of music slumbers in the shell,\n  Till waked and kindled by the master’s spell,\n  And feeling hearts–touch them but lightly–pour\n  A thousand melodies unheard before.” [10]",
        "As an education–",
        "  “I have sent books and music there, and all\n  Those instruments with which high spirits call\n  The future from its cradle, and the past\n  Out of its grave, and make the present last\n  In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die,\n  Folded within their own eternity.” [11]",
        "As an aid to religion–",
        "  “As from the power of sacred lays\n    The spheres began to move,\n  And sung the great Creator’s praise\n    To all the blessed above,\n  So when the last and dreadful hour\n  This crumbling pageant shall devour,\n  The trumpet shall be heard on high.\n  The dead shall live, the living die,\n  And music shall untune the sky.” [12]",
        "Or again–",
        "  “Hark how it falls! and now It steals along,\n    Like distant bells upon the lake at eve.\n  When all is still; and now it grows more strong\n    As when the choral train their dirges weave\n  Mellow and many voiced; where every close\n    O’er the old minster roof, in echoing waves reflows.\n  Oh! I am rapt aloft. My spirit soars\n    Beyond the skies, and leaves the stars behind;\n  Lo! angels lead me to the happy shores,\n    And floating paeans fill the buoyant wind.\n  Farewell! base earth, farewell! my soul is freed.”",
        "The power of Music to sway the feelings of Man has never been more\ncleverly portrayed than by Dryden in “The Feast of Alexander,” though the\ncircumstances of the case precluded any reference to the influence of\nMusic in its noblest aspects.",
        "Poets have always attributed to Music–and who would wish to deny it?–a\npower even over the inanimate forces of Nature. Shakespeare accounts for\nshooting stars by the attraction of Music:",
        "  “The rude sea grew civil at her song,\n  And certain stars shot madly from their spheres\n  To hear the Sea-maid’s music.”",
        "Prose writers have also been inspired by Music to their highest eloquence.\n“Music,” says Plato, “is a moral law. It gives a soul to the universe,\nwings to the mind, flight to the imagination, a charm to sadness, gaiety\nand life to everything. It is the essence of order, and leads to all that\nis good, just, and beautiful, of which it is the invisible, but\nnevertheless dazzling, passionate, and eternal form.” “Music,” said\nLuther, “is a fair and glorious gift from God. I would not for the world\nrenounce my humble share in music.” “Music,” said Halevy, “is an art that\nGod has given us, in which the voices of all nations may unite their\nprayers in one harmonious rhythm.” Or Carlyle, “Music is a kind of\ninarticulate, unfathomable speech, which leads us to the edge of the\ninfinite, and lets us for moments gaze into it.”",
        "Let me also quote Helmholtz, one of the profoundest exponents of modern\nscience. “Just as in the rolling ocean, this movement, rhythmically\nrepeated, and yet ever-varying, rivets our attention and hurries us along.\nBut whereas in the sea blind physical forces alone are at work, and hence\nthe final impression on the spectator’s mind is nothing but solitude–in a\nmusical work of art the movement follows the outflow of the artist’s own\nemotions. Now gently gliding, now gracefully leaping, now violently\nstirred, penetrated, or laboriously contending with the natural expression\nof passion, the stream of sound, in primitive vivacity, bears over into\nthe hearer’s soul unimagined moods which the artist has overheard from his\nown, and finally raises him up to that repose of everlasting beauty of\nwhich God has allowed but few of his elect favorites to be the heralds.”",
        "“There are but seven notes in the scale; make them fourteen,” says Newman,\n“yet what a slender outfit for so vast an enterprise! What science brings\nso much out of so little? Out of what poor elements does some great master\nin it create his new world! Shall we say that all this exuberant\ninventiveness is a mere ingenuity or trick of art, like some game of\nfashion of the day, without reality, without meaning?... Is it possible\nthat that inexhaustible evolution and disposition of notes, so rich yet so\nsimple, so intricate yet so regulated, so various yet so majestic, should\nbe a mere sound, which is gone and perishes? Can it be that those\nmysterious stirrings of the heart, and keen emotions, and strange\nyearnings after we know not what, and awful impressions from we know not\nwhence, should be wrought in us by what is unsubstantial, and comes and\ngoes, and begins and ends in itself? it is not so; it cannot be. No; they\nhave escaped from some higher sphere; they are the outpourings of eternal\nharmony in the medium of created sound; they are echoes from our Home;\nthey are the voices of Angels, or the Magnificat of Saints, or the living\nlaws of Divine Governance, or the Divine Attributes; something are they\nbesides themselves, which we cannot compass, which we cannot utter, though\nmortal man, and he perhaps not otherwise distinguished above his fellows,\nhas the gift of eliciting them.”",
        "Poetry and Music unite in song. From the earliest ages song has been the\nsweet companion of labor. The rude chant of the boatman floats upon the\nwater, the shepherd sings upon the hill, the milkmaid in the dairy, the\nploughman at the plough. Every trade, every occupation, every act and\nscene of life, has long had its own especial music. The bride went to her\nmarriage, the laborer to his work, the old man to his last long rest, each\nwith appropriate and immemorial music.",
        "Music has been truly described as the mother of sympathy, the handmaid of\nReligion, and will never exercise its full effect, as the Emperor Charles\nVI. said to Farinelli, unless it aims not merely to charm the ear, but to\ntouch the heart.",
        "There are many who consider that our life at present is peculiarly prosaic\nand mercenary. I greatly doubt whether that be the case, but if so our\nneed for Music is all the more imperative.",
        "Much as Music has already done for man, we may hope even more from it in\nthe future.",
        "It is, moreover, a joy for all. To appreciate Science or Art requires some\ntraining, and no doubt the cultivated ear will more and more appreciate\nthe beauties of Music; but though there are exceptional individuals, and\neven races, almost devoid of any love of Music, still they are happily but\nrare.",
        "Good Music, moreover, does not necessarily involve any considerable\noutlay; it is even now no mere luxury of the rich, and we may hope that as\ntime goes on, it will become more and more the comfort and solace of the\npoor.",
