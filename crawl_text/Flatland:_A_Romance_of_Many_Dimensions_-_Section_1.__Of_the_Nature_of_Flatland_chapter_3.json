        "\nI call our world Flatland, not because we call it so,\nbut to make its nature clearer to you, my happy readers,\nwho are privileged to live in Space.",
        "Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles,\nSquares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining\nfixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface,\nbut without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much\nlike shadows — only hard and with luminous edges — and you will then\nhave a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen.  Alas,\na few years ago, I should have said “my universe”:  but now my mind\nhas been opened to higher views of things.",
        "In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible\nthat there should be anything of what you call a “solid” kind;\nbut I dare say you will suppose that we could at least\ndistinguish by sight the Triangles, Squares, and other figures,\nmoving about as I have described them.  On the contrary,\nwe could see nothing of the kind, not at least so as to distinguish\none figure from another.  Nothing was visible, nor could be visible,\nto us, except Straight Lines; and the necessity of this\nI will speedily demonstrate.",
        "Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space;\nand leaning over it, look down upon it.  It will appear a circle.",
        "But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower\nyour eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of\nthe inhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming\nmore and more oval to your view, and at last when you have placed\nyour eye exactly on the edge of the table (so that you are,\nas it were, actually a Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased\nto appear oval at all, and will have become, so far as you can see,\na straight line.",
        "The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the same way\na Triangle, or Square, or any other figure cut out of pasteboard.\nAs soon as you look at it with your eye on the edge on the table,\nyou will find that it ceases to appear to you a figure,\nand that it becomes in appearance a straight line.  Take for example\nan equilateral Triangle — who represents with us a Tradesman\nof the respectable class.  Fig. 1 represents the Tradesman\nas you would see him while you were bending over him from above;\nfigs. 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman, as you would see him\nif your eye were close to the level, or all but on the level of\nthe table; and if your eye were quite on the level of the table\n(and that is how we see him in Flatland) you would see nothing\nbut a straight line.",
        "Illustration 1",
        "When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar\nexperiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant\nisland or coast lying on the horizon.  The far-off land may have bays,\nforelands, angles in and out to any number and extent;\nyet at a distance you see none of these (unless indeed your sun shines\nbright upon them revealing the projections and retirements by means of\nlight and shade), nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the water.",
        "Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other\nacquaintances comes toward us in Flatland.  As there is neither\nsun with us, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows,\nwe have none of the helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland.\nIf our friend comes closer to us we see his line becomes larger;\nif he leaves us it becomes smaller:  but still he looks like\na straight line; be he a Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle,\nwhat you will — a straight Line he looks and nothing else.",
        "You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantageous circumstances\nwe are able to distinguish our friends from one another:\nbut the answer to this very natural question will be more fitly\nand easily given when I come to describe the inhabitants of Flatland.\nFor the present let me defer this subject, and say a word or two\nabout the climate and houses in our country.",
