        "The weather was intensely cold about the middle of January. Gervaise\nhad not been able to pay her rent, due on the first. She had little\nor no work and consequently no food to speak of. The sky was dark and\ngloomy and the air heavy with the coming of a storm. Gervaise thought\nit barely possible that her husband might come in with a little money.\nAfter all, everything is possible, and he had said that he would work.\nGervaise after a little, by dint of dwelling on this thought, had come\nto consider it a certainty. Yes, Coupeau would bring home some money,\nand they would have a good, hot, comfortable dinner. As to herself,\nshe had given up trying to get work, for no one would have her. This\ndid not much trouble her, however, for she had arrived at that point\nwhen the mere exertion of moving had become intolerable to her. She\nnow lay stretched on the bed, for she was warmer there.",
        "Gervaise called it a bed. In reality it was only a pile of straw\nin the corner, for she had sold her bed and all her furniture. She\noccasionally swept the straw together with a broom, and, after all,\nit was neither dustier nor dirtier than everything else in the place.\nOn this straw, therefore, Gervaise now lay with her eyes wide open.\nHow long, she wondered, could people live without eating? She was not\nhungry, but there was a strange weight at the pit of her stomach. Her\nhaggard eyes wandered about the room in search of anything she could\nsell. She vaguely wished someone would buy the spider webs which hung\nin all the corners. She knew them to be very good for cuts, but she\ndoubted if they had any market value.",
        "Tired of this contemplation, she got up and took her one chair to\nthe window and looked out into the dingy courtyard.",
        "Her landlord had been there that day and declared he would wait only\none week for his money, and if it were not forthcoming he would turn\nthem into the street. It drove her wild to see him stand in his heavy\novercoat and tell her so coldly that he would pack her off at once.\nShe hated him with a vindictive hatred, as she did her fool of a\nhusband and the Lorilleuxs and Poissons. In fact, she hated everyone\non that especial day.",
        "Unfortunately people can’t live without eating, and before the woman’s\nfamished eyes floated visions of food. Not of dainty little dishes.\nShe had long since ceased to care for those and ate all she could get\nwithout being in the least fastidious in regard to its quality. When\nshe had a little money she bought a bullock’s heart or a bit of cheese\nor some beans, and sometimes she begged from a restaurant and made\na sort of panada of the crusts they gave her, which she cooked on a\nneighbor’s stove. She was quite willing to dispute with a dog for a\nbone. Once the thought of such things would have disgusted her, but\nat that time she did not–for three days in succession–go without a\nmorsel of food. She remembered how last week Coupeau had stolen a half\nloaf of bread and sold it, or rather exchanged it, for liquor.",
        "She sat at the window, looking at the pale sky, and finally fell\nasleep. She dreamed that she was out in a snowstorm and could not find\nher way home. She awoke with a start and saw that night was coming on.\nHow long the days are when one’s stomach is empty! She waited for\nCoupeau and the relief he would bring.",
        "The clock struck in the next room. Could it be possible? Was it only\nthree? Then she began to cry. How could she ever wait until seven?\nAfter another half-hour of suspense she started up. Yes, they might\nsay what they pleased, but she, at least, would try to borrow ten\nsous from the Lorilleuxs.",
        "There was a continual borrowing of small sums in this corridor during\nthe winter, but no matter what was the emergency no one ever dreamed\nof applying to the Lorilleuxs. Gervaise summoned all her courage and\nrapped at the door.",
        "“Come in!” cried a sharp voice.",
        "How good it was there! Warm and bright with the glow of the forge. And\nGervaise smelled the soup, too, and it made her feel faint and sick.",
        "“Ah, it is you, is it?” said Mme Lorilleux. “What do you want?”",
        "Gervaise hesitated. The application for ten sous stuck in her throat,\nbecause she saw Boche seated by the stove.",
        "“What do you want?” asked Lorilleux, in his turn.",
        "“Have you seen Coupeau?” stammered Gervaise. “I thought he was here.”",
        "His sister answered with a sneer that they rarely saw Coupeau. They\nwere not rich enough to offer him as many glasses of wine as he wanted\nin these days.",
        "Gervaise stammered out a disconnected sentence.",
        "He had promised to come home. She needed food; she needed money.",
        "A profound silence followed. Mme Lorilleux fanned her fire, and her\nhusband bent more closely over his work, while Boche smiled with an\nexpectant air.",
        "“If I could have ten sous,” murmured Gervaise.",
        "The silence continued.",
        "“If you would lend them to me,” said Gervaise, “I would give them back\nin the morning.”",
        "Mme Lorilleux turned and looked her full in the face, thinking to\nherself that if she yielded once the next day it would be twenty sous,\nand who could tell where it would stop?",
        "“But, my dear,” she cried, “you know we have no money and no prospect\nof any; otherwise, of course, we would oblige you.”",
        "“Certainly,” said Lorilleux, “the heart is willing, but the pockets\nare empty.”",
        "Gervaise bowed her head, but she did not leave instantly. She looked\nat the gold wire on which her sister-in-law was working and at that in\nthe hands of Lorilleux and thought that it would take a mere scrap to\ngive her a good dinner. On that day the room was very dirty and filled\nwith charcoal dust, but she saw it resplendent with riches like the\nshop of a money-changer, and she said once more in a low, soft voice:",
        "“I will bring back the ten sous. I will, indeed!” Tears were in her\neyes, but she was determined not to say that she had eaten nothing\nfor twenty-four hours.",
        "“I can’t tell you how much I need it,” she continued.",
        "The husband and wife exchanged a look. Wooden Legs begging at their\ndoor! Well! Well! Who would have thought it? Why had they not known it\nwas she when they rashly called out, “Come in?” Really, they could not\nallow such people to cross their threshold; there was too much that\nwas valuable in the room. They had several times distrusted Gervaise;\nshe looked about so queerly, and now they would not take their eyes\noff her.",
        "Gervaise went toward Lorilleux as she spoke.",
        "“Take care!” he said roughly. “You will carry off some of the\nparticles of gold on the soles of your shoes. It looks really as\nif you had greased them!”",
        "Gervaise drew back. She leaned against the _etagere_ for a moment\nand, seeing that her sister-in-law’s eyes were fixed on her hands,\nshe opened them and said in a gentle, weary voice–the voice of a\nwoman who had ceased to struggle:",
        "“I have taken nothing. You can look for yourself.”",
        "And she went away; the warmth of the place and the smell of the soup\nwere unbearable.",
        "The Lorilleuxs shrugged their shoulders as the door closed. They\nhoped they had seen the last of her face. She had brought all her\nmisfortunes on her own head, and she had, therefore, no right to\nexpect any assistance from them. Boche joined in these animadversions,\nand all three considered themselves avenged for the blue shop and all\nthe rest.",
        "“I know her!” said Mme Lorilleux. “If I had lent her the ten sous she\nwanted she would have spent it in liquor.”",
        "Gervaise crawled down the corridor with slipshod shoes and slouching\nshoulders, but at her door she hesitated; she could not go in: she was\nafraid. She would walk up and down a little–that would keep her warm.\nAs she passed she looked in at Father Bru, but to her surprise he was\nnot there, and she asked herself with a pang of jealousy if anyone\ncould possibly have asked him out to dine. When she reached the\nBijards’ she heard a groan. She went in.",
        "“What is the matter?” she said.",
        "The room was very clean and in perfect order. Lalie that very morning\nhad swept and arranged everything. In vain did the cold blast of\npoverty blow through that chamber and bring with it dirt and disorder.\nLalie was always there; she cleaned and scrubbed and gave to\neverything a look of gentility. There was little money but much\ncleanliness within those four walls.",
        "The two children were cutting out pictures in a corner, but Lalie was\nin bed, lying very straight and pale, with the sheet pulled over her\nchin.",
        "“What is the matter?” asked Gervaise anxiously.",
        "Lalie slowly lifted her white lids and tried to speak.",
        "“Nothing,” she said faintly; “nothing, I assure you!” Then as her eyes\nclosed she added:",
        "“I am only a little lazy and am taking my ease.”",
        "But her face bore the traces of such frightful agony that Gervaise\nfell on her knees by the side of the bed. She knew that the child\nhad had a cough for a month, and she saw the blood trickling from\nthe corners of her mouth.",
        "“It is not my fault,” Lalie murmured. “I thought I was strong enough,\nand I washed the floor. I could not finish the windows though.\nEverything but those are clean. But I was so tired that I was obliged\nto lie down––”",
        "She interrupted herself to say:",
        "“Please see that my children are not cutting themselves with the\nscissors.”",
        "She started at the sound of a heavy step on the stairs. Her father\nnoisily pushed open the door. As usual he had drunk too much, and\nin his eyes blazed the lurid flames kindled by alcohol.",
        "When he saw Lalie lying down he walked to the corner and took up the\nlong whip, from which he slowly unwound the lash.",
        "“This is a good joke!” he said. “The idea of your daring to go to bed\nat this hour. Come, up with you!”",
        "He snapped the whip over the bed, and the child murmured softly:",
        "“Do not strike me, Papa. I am sure you will be sorry if you do. Do not\nstrike me!”",
        "“Up with you!” he cried. “Up with you!”",
        "Then she answered faintly:",
        "“I cannot, for I am dying.”",
        "Gervaise had snatched the whip from Bijard, who stood with his under\njaw dropped, glaring at his daughter. What could the little fool mean?\nWhoever heard of a child dying like that when she had not even been\nsick? Oh, she was lying!",
        "“You will see that I am telling you the truth,” she replied. “I did\nnot tell you as long as I could help it. Be kind to me now, Papa, and\nsay good-by as if you loved me.”",
        "Bijard passed his hand over his eyes. She did look very strangely–her\nface was that of a grown woman. The presence of death in that cramped\nroom sobered him suddenly. He looked around with the air of a man who\nhad been suddenly awakened from a dream. He saw the two little ones\nclean and happy and the room neat and orderly.",
        "He fell into a chair.",
        "“Dear little mother!” he murmured. “Dear little mother!”",
        "This was all he said, but it was very sweet to Lalie, who had never\nbeen spoiled by overpraise. She comforted him. She told him how\ngrieved she was to go away and leave him before she had entirely\nbrought up her children. He would watch over them, would he not? And\nin her dying voice she gave him some little details in regard to their\nclothes. He–the alcohol having regained its power–listened with\nround eyes of wonder.",
        "After a long silence Lalie spoke again:",
        "“We owe four francs and seven sous to the baker. He must be paid.\nMadame Goudron has an iron that belongs to us; you must not forget it.\nThis evening I was not able to make the soup, but there are bread and\ncold potatoes.”",
        "As long as she breathed the poor little mite continued to be the\nmother of the family. She died because her breast was too small to\ncontain so great a heart, and that he lost this precious treasure\nwas entirely her father’s fault. He, wretched creature, had kicked\nher mother to death and now, just as surely, murdered his daughter.",
        "Gervaise tried to keep back her tears. She held Lalie’s hands, and\nas the bedclothes slipped away she rearranged them. In doing so she\ncaught a glimpse of the poor little figure. The sight might have drawn\ntears from a stone. Lalie wore only a tiny chemise over her bruised\nand bleeding flesh; marks of a lash striped her sides; a livid spot\nwas on her right arm, and from head to foot she was one bruise.",
        "Gervaise was paralyzed at the sight. She wondered, if there were a God\nabove, how He could have allowed the child to stagger under so heavy\na cross.",
        "“Madame Coupeau,” murmured the child, trying to draw the sheet over\nher. She was ashamed, ashamed for her father.",
        "Gervaise could not stay there. The child was fast sinking. Her eyes\nwere fixed on her little ones, who sat in the corner, still cutting\nout their pictures. The room was growing dark, and Gervaise fled from\nit. Ah, what an awful thing life was! And how gladly would she throw\nherself under the wheels of an omnibus, if that might end it!",
        "Almost unconsciously Gervaise took her way to the shop where her\nhusband worked or, rather, pretended to work. She would wait for him\nand get the money before he had a chance to spend it.",
        "It was a very cold corner where she stood. The sounds of the carriages\nand footsteps were strangely muffled by reason of the fast-falling\nsnow. Gervaise stamped her feet to keep them from freezing. The people\nwho passed offered few distractions, for they hurried by with their\ncoat collars turned up to their ears. But Gervaise saw several women\nwatching the door of the factory quite as anxiously as herself–they\nwere wives who, like herself, probably wished to get hold of a portion\nof their husbands’ wages. She did not know them, but it required no\nintroduction to understand their business.",
        "The door of the factory remained firmly shut for some time. Then it\nopened to allow the egress of one workman; then two, three, followed,\nbut these were probably those who, well behaved, took their wages home\nto their wives, for they neither retreated nor started when they saw\nthe little crowd. One woman fell on a pale little fellow and, plunging\nher hand into his pocket, carried off every sou of her husband’s\nearnings, while he, left without enough to pay for a pint of wine,\nwent off down the street almost weeping.",
        "Some other men appeared, and one turned back to warn a comrade, who\ncame gamely and fearlessly out, having put his silver pieces in his\nshoes. In vain did his wife look for them in his pockets; in vain\ndid she scold and coax–he had no money, he declared.",
        "Then came another noisy group, elbowing each other in their haste to\nreach a cabaret, where they could drink away their week’s wages. These\nfellows were followed by some shabby men who were swearing under their\nbreath at the trifle they had received, having been tipsy and absent\nmore than half the week.",
        "But the saddest sight of all was the grief of a meek little woman in\nblack, whose husband, a tall, good-looking fellow, pushed her roughly\naside and walked off down the street with his boon companions, leaving\nher to go home alone, which she did, weeping her very heart out as she\nwent.",
        "Gervaise still stood watching the entrance. Where was Coupeau? She\nasked some of the men, who teased her by declaring that he had just\ngone by the back door. She saw by this time that Coupeau had lied to\nher, that he had not been at work that day. She also saw that there\nwas no dinner for her. There was not a shadow of hope–nothing but\nhunger and darkness and cold.",
        "She toiled up La Rue des Poissonniers when she suddenly heard\nCoupeau’s voice and, glancing in at the window of a wineshop, she\nsaw him drinking with Mes-Bottes, who had had the luck to marry\nthe previous summer a woman with some money. He was now, therefore,\nwell clothed and fed and altogether a happy mortal and had Coupeau’s\nadmiration. Gervaise laid her hands on her husband’s shoulders as\nhe left the cabaret.",
        "“I am hungry,” she said softly.",
        "“Hungry, are you? Well then, eat your fist and keep the other for\ntomorrow.”",
        "“Shall I steal a loaf of bread?” she asked in a dull, dreary tone.",
        "Mes-Bottes smoothed his chin and said in a conciliatory voice:",
        "“No, no! Don’t do that; it is against the law. But if a woman\nmanages––”",
        "Coupeau interrupted him with a coarse laugh.",
        "Yes, a woman, if she had any sense, could always get along, and it\nwas her own fault if she starved.",
        "And the two men walked on toward the outer boulevard. Gervaise\nfollowed them. Again she said:",
        "“I am hungry. You know I have had nothing to eat. You must find me\nsomething.”",
        "He did not answer, and she repeated her words in a tone of agony.",
        "“Good God!” he exclaimed, turning upon her furiously. “What can I do?\nI have nothing. Be off with you, unless you want to be beaten.”",
        "He lifted his fist; she recoiled and said with set teeth:",
        "“Very well then; I will go and find some man who has a sou.”",
        "Coupeau pretended to consider this an excellent joke. Yes of course\nshe could make a conquest; by gaslight she was still passably\ngoodlooking. If she succeeded he advised her to dine at the Capucin,\nwhere there was very good eating.",
        "She turned away with livid lips; he called after her:",
        "“Bring some dessert with you, for I love cake. And perhaps you can\ninduce your friend to give me an old coat, for I swear it is cold\ntonight.”",
        "Gervaise, with this infernal mirth ringing in her ears, hurried down\nthe street. She was determined to take this desperate step. She had\nonly a choice between that and theft, and she considered that she\nhad a right to dispose of herself as she pleased. The question of\nright and wrong did not present itself very clearly to her eyes.\n“When one is starving is hardly the time,” she said to herself, “to\nphilosophize.” She walked slowly up and down the boulevard. This part\nof Paris was crowded now with new buildings, between whose sculptured\nfacades ran narrow lanes leading to haunts of squalid misery, which\nwere cheek by jowl with splendor and wealth.",
        "It seemed strange to Gervaise that among this crowd who elbowed her\nthere was not one good Christian to divine her situation and slip some\nsous into her hand. Her head was dizzy, and her limbs would hardly\nbear her weight. At this hour ladies with hats and well-dressed\ngentlemen who lived in these fine new houses were mingled with the\npeople–with the men and women whose faces were pale and sickly from\nthe vitiated air of the workshops in which they passed their lives.\nAnother day of toil was over, but the days came too often and were\ntoo long. One hardly had time to turn over in one’s sleep when the\neverlasting grind began again.",
        "Gervaise went with the crowd. No one looked at her, for the men were\nall hurrying home to their dinner. Suddenly she looked up and beheld\nthe Hotel Boncoeur. It was empty, the shutters and doors covered with\nplacards and the whole facade weather-stained and decaying. It was\nthere in that hotel that the seeds of her present life had been sown.\nShe stood still and looked up at the window of the room she had\noccupied and recalled her youth passed with Lantier and the manner\nin which he had left her. But she was young then and soon recovered\nfrom the blow. That was twenty years ago, and now what was she?",
        "The sight of the place made her sick, and she turned toward\nMontmartre. She passed crowds of workwomen with little parcels in\ntheir hands and children who had been sent to the baker’s, carrying\nfour-pound loaves of bread as tall as themselves, which looked like\nshining brown dolls.",
        "By degrees the crowd dispersed, and Gervaise was almost alone.\nEveryone was at dinner. She thought how delicious it would be to lie\ndown and never rise again–to feel that all toil was over. And this\nwas the end of her life! Gervaise, amid the pangs of hunger, thought\nof some of the fete days she had known and remembered that she had not\nalways been miserable. Once she was pretty, fair and fresh. She had\nbeen a kind and admired mistress in her shop. Gentlemen came to it\nonly to see her, and she vaguely wondered where all this youth and\nthis beauty had fled.",
        "Again she looked up; she had reached the abattoirs, which were now\nbeing torn down; the fronts were taken away, showing the dark holes\nwithin, the very stones of which reeked with blood. Farther on was\nthe hospital with its high, gray walls, with two wings opening out\nlike a huge fan. A door in the wall was the terror of the whole\n_Quartier_–the Door of the Dead, it was called–through which\nall the bodies were carried.",
        "She hurried past this solid oak door and went down to the railroad\nbridge, under which a train had just passed, leaving in its rear\na floating cloud of smoke. She wished she were on that train which\nwould take her into the country, and she pictured to herself open\nspaces and the fresh air and expanse of blue sky; perhaps she could\nlive a new life there.",
        "As she thought this her weary eyes began to puzzle out in the dim\ntwilight the words on a printed handbill pasted on one of the pillars\nof the arch. She read one–an advertisement offering fifty francs for\na lost dog. Someone must have loved the creature very much.",
        "Gervaise turned back again. The street lamps were being lit and\ndefined long lines of streets and avenues. The restaurants were all\ncrowded, and people were eating and drinking. Before the Assommoir\nstood a crowd waiting their turn and room within, and as a respectable\ntradesman passed he said with a shake of the head that many a man\nwould be drunk that night in Paris. And over this scene hung the dark\nsky, low and clouded.",
        "Gervaise wished she had a few sous: she would, in that case, have gone\ninto this place and drunk until she ceased to feel hungry, and through\nthe window she watched the still with an angry consciousness that all\nher misery and all her pain came from that. If she had never touched\na drop of liquor all might have been so different.",
        "She started from her reverie; this was the hour of which she must\ntake advantage. Men had dined and were comparatively amiable. She\nlooked around her and toward the trees where–under the leafless\nbranches–she saw more than one female figure. Gervaise watched them,\ndetermined to do what they did. Her heart was in her throat; it seemed\nto her that she was dreaming a bad dream.",
        "She stood for some fifteen minutes; none of the men who passed looked\nat her. Finally she moved a little and spoke to one who, with his\nhands in his pockets, was whistling as he walked.",
        "“Sir,” she said in a low voice, “please listen to me.”",
        "The man looked at her from head to foot and went on whistling louder\nthan before.",
        "Gervaise grew bolder. She forgot everything except the pangs of\nhunger. The women under the trees walked up and down with the\nregularity of wild animals in a cage.",
        "“Sir,” she said again, “please listen.”",
        "But the man went on. She walked toward the Hotel Boncoeur again,\npast the hospital, which was now brilliantly lit. There she turned\nand went back over the same ground–the dismal ground between the\nslaughterhouses and the place where the sick lay dying. With these\ntwo places she seemed to feel bound by some mysterious tie.",
        "“Sir, please listen!”",
        "She saw her shadow on the ground as she stood near a street lamp. It\nwas a grotesque shadow–grotesque because of her ample proportions.\nHer limp had become, with time and her additional weight, a very\ndecided deformity, and as she moved the lengthening shadow of herself\nseemed to be creeping along the sides of the houses with bows and\ncurtsies of mock reverence. Never before had she realized the change\nin herself. She was fascinated by this shadow. It was very droll, she\nthought, and she wondered if the men did not think so too.",
        "“Sir, please listen!”",
        "It was growing late. Man after man, in a beastly state of\nintoxication, reeled past her; quarrels and disputes filled the air.",
        "Gervaise walked on, half asleep. She was conscious of little except\nthat she was starving. She wondered where her daughter was and what\nshe was eating, but it was too much trouble to think, and she shivered\nand crawled on. As she lifted her face she felt the cutting wind,\naccompanied by the snow, fine and dry, like gravel. The storm had\ncome.",
        "People were hurrying past her, but she saw one man walking slowly.\nShe went toward him.",
        "“Sir, please listen!”",
        "The man stopped. He did not seem to notice what she said but extended\nhis hand and murmured in a low voice:",
        "“Charity, if you please!”",
        "The two looked at each other. Merciful heavens! It was Father Bru\nbegging and Mme Coupeau doing worse. They stood looking at each\nother–equals in misery. The aged workman had been trying to make up\nhis mind all the evening to beg, and the first person he stopped was\na woman as poor as himself! This was indeed the irony of fate. Was it\nnot a pity to have toiled for fifty years and then to beg his bread?\nTo have been one of the most flourishing laundresses in Paris and then\nto make her bed in the gutter? They looked at each other once more,\nand without a word each went their own way through the fast-falling\nsnow, which blinded Gervaise as she struggled on, the wind wrapping\nher thin skirts around her legs so that she could hardly walk.",
        "Suddenly an absolute whirlwind struck her and bore her breathless\nand helpless along–she did not even know in what direction. When at\nlast she was able to open her eyes she could see nothing through the\nblinding snow, but she heard a step and saw the outlines of a man’s\nfigure. She snatched him by the blouse.",
        "“Sir,” she said, “please listen.”",
        "The man turned. It was Goujet.",
        "Ah, what had she done to be thus tortured and humiliated? Was God in\nheaven an angry God always? This was the last dreg of bitterness in\nher cup. She saw her shadow: her limp, she felt, made her walk like an\nintoxicated woman, which was indeed hard, when she had not swallowed\na drop.",
        "Goujet looked at her while the snow whitened his yellow beard.",
        "“Come!” he said.",
        "And he walked on, she following him. Neither spoke.",
        "Poor Mme Goujet had died in October of acute rheumatism, and her son\ncontinued to reside in the same apartment. He had this night been\nsitting with a sick friend.",
        "He entered, lit a lamp and turned toward Gervaise, who stood humbly\non the threshold.",
        "“Come in!” he said in a low voice, as if his mother could have heard\nhim.",
        "The first room was that of Mme Goujet, which was unchanged since her\ndeath. Near the window stood her frame, apparently ready for the old\nlady. The bed was carefully made, and she could have slept there had\nshe returned from the cemetery to spend a night with her son. The room\nwas clean, sweet and orderly.",
        "“Come in,” repeated Goujet.",
        "Gervaise entered with the air of a woman who is startled at finding\nherself in a respectable place. He was pale and trembling. They\ncrossed his mother’s room softly, and when Gervaise stood within\nhis own he closed the door.",
        "It was the same room in which he had lived ever since she knew\nhim–small and almost virginal in its simplicity. Gervaise dared not\nmove.",
        "Goujet snatched her in his arms, but she pushed him away faintly.",
        "The stove was still hot, and a dish was on the top of it. Gervaise\nlooked toward it. Goujet understood. He placed the dish on the table,\npoured her out some wine and cut a slice of bread.",
        "“Thank you,” she said. “How good you are!”",
        "She trembled to that degree that she could hardly hold her fork.\nHunger gave her eyes the fierceness of a famished beast and to her\nhead the tremulous motion of senility. After eating a potato she burst\ninto tears but continued to eat, with the tears streaming down her\ncheeks and her chin quivering.",
        "“Will you have some more bread?” he asked. She said no; she said yes;\nshe did not know what she said.",
        "And he stood looking at her in the clear light of the lamp. How old\nand shabby she was! The heat was melting the snow on her hair and\nclothing, and water was dripping from all her garments. Her hair was\nvery gray and roughened by the wind. Where was the pretty white throat\nhe so well remembered? He recalled the days when he first knew her,\nwhen her skin was so delicate and she stood at her table, briskly\nmoving the hot irons to and fro. He thought of the time when she had\ncome to the forge and of the joy with which he would have welcomed\nher then to his room. And now she was there!",
        "She finished her bread amid great silent tears and then rose to her\nfeet.",
        "Goujet took her hand.",
        "“I love you, Madame Gervaise; I love you still,” he cried.",
        "“Do not say that,” she exclaimed, “for it is impossible.”",
        "He leaned toward her.",
        "“Will you allow me to kiss you?” he asked respectfully.",
        "She did not know what to say, so great was her emotion.",
        "He kissed her gravely and solemnly and then pressed his lips upon\nher gray hair. He had never kissed anyone since his mother’s death,\nand Gervaise was all that remained to him of the past.",
        "He turned away and, throwing himself on his bed, sobbed aloud.\nGervaise could not endure this. She exclaimed:",
        "“I love you, Monsieur Goujet, and I understand. Farewell!”",
        "And she rushed through Mme Goujet’s room and then through the street\nto her home. The house was all dark, and the arched door into the\ncourtyard looked like huge, gaping jaws. Could this be the house where\nshe once desired to reside? Had she been deaf in those days, not to\nhave heard that wail of despair which pervaded the place from top to\nbottom? From the day when she first set her foot within the house she\nhad steadily gone downhill.",
        "Yes, it was a frightful way to live–so many people herded together,\nto become the prey of cholera or vice. She looked at the courtyard\nand fancied it a cemetery surrounded by high walls. The snow lay white\nwithin it. She stepped over the usual stream from the dyer’s, but\nthis time the stream was black and opened for itself a path through\nthe white snow. The stream was the color of her thoughts. But she\nremembered when both were rosy.",
        "As she toiled up the six long flights in the darkness she laughed\naloud. She recalled her old dream–to work quietly, have plenty to\neat, a little home to herself, where she could bring up her children,\nnever to be beaten, and to die in her bed! It was droll how things had\nturned out. She worked no more; she had nothing to eat; she lived amid\ndirt and disorder. Her daughter had gone to the bad, and her husband\nbeat her whenever he pleased. As for dying in her bed, she had none.\nShould she throw herself out of the window and find one on the\npavement below?",
        "She had not been unreasonable in her wishes, surely. She had not\nasked of heaven an income of thirty thousand francs or a carriage\nand horses. This was a queer world! And then she laughed again as\nshe remembered that she had once said that after she had worked for\ntwenty years she would retire into the country.",
        "Yes, she would go into the country, for she should soon have her\nlittle green corner in Pere-Lachaise.",
        "Her poor brain was disturbed. She had bidden an eternal farewell to\nGoujet. They would never see each other again. All was over between\nthem–love and friendship too.",
        "As she passed the Bijards’ she looked in and saw Lalie lying dead,\nhappy and at peace. It was well with the child.",
        "“She is lucky,” muttered Gervaise.",
        "At this moment she saw a gleam of light under the undertaker’s door.\nShe threw it wide open with a wild desire that he should take her as\nwell as Lalie. Bazonge had come in that night more tipsy than usual\nand had thrown his hat and cloak in the corner, while he lay in the\nmiddle of the floor.",
        "He started up and called out:",
        "“Shut that door! And don’t stand there–it is too cold. What do you\nwant?”",
        "Then Gervaise, with arms outstretched, not knowing or caring what she\nsaid, began to entreat him with passionate vehemence:",
        "“Oh, take me!” she cried. “I can bear it no longer. Take me, I implore\nyou!”",
        "And she knelt before him, a lurid light blazing in her haggard eyes.",
        "Father Bazonge, with garments stained by the dust of the cemetery,\nseemed to her as glorious as the sun. But the old man, yet half\nasleep, rubbed his eyes and could not understand her.",
        "“What are you talking about?” he muttered.",
        "“Take me,” repeated Gervaise, more earnestly than before. “Do you\nremember one night when I rapped on the partition? Afterward I said\nI did not, but I was stupid then and afraid. But I am not afraid now.\nHere, take my hands–they are not cold with terror. Take me and put\nme to sleep, for I have but this one wish now.”",
        "Bazonge, feeling that it was not proper to argue with a lady, said:",
        "“You are right. I have buried three women today, who would each have\ngiven me a jolly little sum out of gratitude, if they could have put\ntheir hands in their pockets. But you see, my dear woman, it is not\nsuch an easy thing you are asking of me.”",
        "“Take me!” cried Gervaise. “Take me! I want to go away!”",
        "“But there is a certain little operation first, you know––” And he\npretended to choke and rolled up his eyes.",
        "Gervaise staggered to her feet. He, too, rejected her and would have\nnothing to do with her. She crawled into her room and threw herself on\nher straw. She was sorry she had eaten anything and delayed the work\nof starvation.",
