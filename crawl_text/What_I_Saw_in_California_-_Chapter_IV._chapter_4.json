        "From the 21st of September to the 13th of October I remained at San\nFrancisco. The weather during this period was uniformly clear. The\nclimate of San Francisco is peculiar and local, from its position.\nDuring the summer and autumnal months, the wind on this coast blows\nfrom the west and northwest, directly from the ocean. The mornings here\nare usually calm and pleasantly warm. About twelve o’clock M., the wind\nblows strong from the ocean, through the entrance of the bay, rendering\nthe temperature cool enough for woollen clothing in midsummer. About\nsunset the wind dies away, and the evenings and nights are comparatively\ncalm. In the winter months the wind blows in soft and gentle breezes\nfrom the south-east, and the temperature is agreeable, the thermometer\nrarely sinking below 50 deg. When the winds blow from the ocean, it\nnever rains; when they blow from the land, as they do during the winter\nand spring months, the weather is showery, and resembles that of the\nmonth of May in the same latitude on the Atlantic coast. The coolness\nof the climate and briskness of the air above described are confined to\nparticular positions on the coast, and the description in this respect\nis not applicable to the interior of the country, nor even to other\nlocalities immediately on the coast.",
        "On the 21st, by invitation of Captain Montgomery, I dined on board of\nthe sloop-of-war Portsmouth. The party, including myself, consisted of\nColonel Russell, Mr. Jacob, Lieutenant Bartlett, and a son of Captain\nM. There are few if any officers in our navy more highly and\nuniversally esteemed, for their moral qualities and professional\nmerits, than Captain M. He is a sincere Christian, a brave officer, and\nan accomplished gentleman. Under the orders of Commodore Sloat, he\nfirst raised the American flag in San Francisco. We spent the afternoon\nmost agreeably, and the refined hospitality, courteous manners, and\nintelligent and interesting conversation of our host made us regret the\nrapidly fleeting moments. The wines on the table were the produce of\nthe vine of California, and, having attained age, were of an excellent\nquality in substance and flavour.",
        "I attended a supper-party given this evening by Mr. Frank Ward. The\nparty was composed of citizens of the town, and officers of the navy\nand the merchant and whale ships in the harbour. In such a company as\nwas here assembled, it was very difficult for me to realize that I was\nmany thousand miles from, home, in a strange and foreign country. All\nthe faces about me were American, and there was nothing in scene or\nsentiment to remind the guests of their remoteness from their native\nshores. Indeed, it seems to be a settled opinion, that California is\nhenceforth to compose a part of the United States, and every American\nwho is now here considers himself as treading upon his own soil, as\nmuch as if he were in one of the old thirteen revolutionary states.\nSong, sentiment, story, and wit heightened the enjoyments of the\nexcellent entertainment of our host, and the jovial party did not\nseparate until a late hour of the night. The guests, as may be\nsupposed, were composed chiefly of gentlemen who had, from their\npursuits, travelled over most of the world–had seen developments of\nhuman character under every variety of circumstance, and observed\nsociety, civilized, barbarous, and savage, in all its phases. Their\nconversation, therefore, when around the convivial board, possessed an\nunhackneyed freshness and raciness highly entertaining and instructive.",
        "On the 27th of September, the U.S. frigate Congress, Captain\nLivingston, bearing the broad pennant of Commodore Stockton, and the\nU.S. frigate Savannah, Captain Mervine, anchored in the harbour, having\nsailed from Monterey a day or two previously. The arrival of these\nlarge men-of-war produced an increase of the bustle in the small town.\nBlue coats and bright buttons (the naval uniform) became the prevailing\ncostume at the billiard-rooms and other public places, and the plain\ndress of a private citizen might be regarded as a badge of distinction.",
        "On the 1st of October a courier arrived from the south with\nintelligence that the Californians at Los Angeles had organized a force\nand rebelled against the authority of the Americans–that they had also\ncaptured an American merchant-vessel lying at San Pedro, the port of\nthe city of Angels, about thirty miles distant, and robbed it of a\nquantity of merchandise and specie. Whether this latter report was or\nwas not true, I do not know–the former was correct. The frigate\nSavannah sailed for Los Angeles immediately.",
        "Among those American naval officers whose agreeable acquaintance I made\nat San Francisco, was Mr. James F. Schenck, first-lieutenant of the\nfrigate Congress, brother of the distinguished member of congress from\nOhio of that name,–a native of Dayton, Ohio,–a gentleman of\nintelligence, keen wit, and a most accomplished officer. The officers\nof our navy are our representatives in foreign countries, and they are\ngenerally such representatives as their constituents have reason to\nfeel proud of. Their chivalry, patriotism, gentlemanlike deportment,\nand professional skill cannot be too much admired and applauded by\ntheir countrymen. I shall ever feel grateful to the naval officers of\nthe Pacific squadron for their numerous civilities during my sojourn on\nthe Pacific coast.",
        "Among the novelties presented while at San Francisco was a trial by\njury–the second tribunal of this kind which had been organized in\nCalifornia. The trial look place before Judge Bartlett, and the\nlitigants were two Mormons. Counsel was employed on both sides. Some of\nthe forms of American judicial proceedings were observed, and many of\nthe legal technicalities and nice flaws, so often urged in common-law\ncourts, were here argued by the learned counsel of the parties, with a\nvehemence of language and gesticulation with which I thought the legal\nlearning and acumen displayed did not correspond. The proceedings were\na mixture, made up of common law, equity, and a sprinkling of military\ndespotism–which last ingredient the court was compelled to employ,\nwhen entangled in the intricate meshes woven by the counsel for the\nlitigants, in order to extricate itself. The jury, after the case was\nreferred to them, were what is called “hung;” they could not agree, and\nthe matters in issue, therefore, remained exactly where they were\nbefore the proceedings were commenced.",
        "I attended one evening a fandango given by Mr. Ridley, an English\ngentleman, whose wife is a Californian lady. Several of the senoras and\nsenoritas from the ranchos of the vicinity were present. The\nCalifornian ladies dance with much ease and grace. The waltz appears to\nbe a favourite with them. Smoking is not prohibited in these\nassemblies, nor is it confined to the gentlemen. The cigarita is\nfreely used by the senoras and senoritas, and they puff it with much\ngusto while threading the mazes of the cotillion or swinging in the\nwaltz.",
        "I had the pleasure of being introduced, at the residence of Mr.\nLeidesdorff, to two young ladies, sisters and belles in Alta\nCalifornia. They are members of an old and numerous family on the\nContra Costa. Their names are singular indeed, for, if I heard them\ncorrectly, one of them was called Donna Maria Jesus, and the other\nDonna Maria Conception. They were interesting and graceful young\nladies, with regular features, symmetrical figures, and their dark eyes\nflashed with all the intelligence and passion characteristic of Spanish\nwomen.",
        "Among the gentlemen with whom I met soon after my arrival at San\nFrancisco, and whoso acquaintance I afterwards cultivated, were Mr. E.\nGrimes and Mr. N. Spear, both natives of Massachusetts, but residents\nof this coast and of the Pacific Islands, for many years. They may be\ncalled the patriarchs of American pioneers on the Pacific. After\nforming an acquaintance with Mr. G., if any one were to say to me that",
        "    “Old Grimes is dead, that good old man,”",
        "I should not hesitate to contradict him with emphasis; for he is still\nliving, and possesses all the charities and virtues which can adorn\nhuman nature, with some of the eccentricities of his name-sake in the\nsong. By leading a life of peril and adventure on the Pacific Ocean for\nfifty years he has accumulated a large fortune, and is a man now\nproverbial for his integrity, candour, and charities. Both of these\ngentlemen have been largely engaged in the local commerce of the\nPacific. Mr. S., some twenty-five or thirty years ago, colonized one of\nthe Cannibal Islands, and remained upon it with the colony for nearly\ntwo years. The attempt to introduce agriculture into the island was a\nfailure, and the enterprise was afterwards abandoned.",
        "On the evening of the third of October, it having been announced that\nCommodore Stockton would land on the fifth, a public meeting of the\ncitizens was called by the alcalde, for the purpose of adopting\nsuitable arrangements for his reception, in his civic capacity as\ngovernor. The meeting was convened in the plaza (Portsmouth Square).\nColonel Russell was appointed chairman, and on motion of E. Bryant a\ncommittee was appointed to make all necessary and suitable arrangements\nfor the reception of his excellency, Governor Stockton. The following\naccount of this pageant I extract from the “California” newspaper of\nOctober 24th, 1846.",
        "“Agreeable to public notice, a large number of the citizens of San\nFrancisco and vicinity assembled in Portsmouth Square for the purpose\nof meeting his excellency Robert F. Stockton, to welcome his arrival,\nand offer him the hospitalities of the city. At ten o’clock, a\nprocession was formed, led by the Chief Marshal of the day, supported\non either hand by two aids, followed by an excellent band of music–a\nmilitary escort, under command of Captain J. Zeilen, U.S.M.C.–Captain\nJohn B. Montgomery and suite–Magistracy of the District, and the\nOrator of the day–Foreign Consuls–Captain John Paty, Senior Captain\nof the Hawanian Navy–Lieutenant-Commanding Ruducoff, Russian Navy, and\nLieutenant-Commanding Bonnett, French Navy. The procession was closed\nby the Committee of Arrangements, captains of ships in port, and a long\nline of citizens.",
        "“General Mariano Guadaloupe Valléjo, with several others who had held\noffice under the late government, took their appropriate place in the\nline.",
        "“The procession moved in fine style down Portsmouth Street to the\nlanding, and formed a line in Water Street. The Governor-General landed\nfrom his barge, and was met on the wharf by Captain John B. Montgomery,\nU.S.N., Judge W.A. Bartlett, and Marshal of the day (Frank Ward), who\nconducted him to the front of the line, and presented him to the\nprocession, through the orator of the day, Colonel Russell, who\naddressed the commodore.”",
        "When the governor and commander-in-chief had closed his reply, the\nprocession moved through the principal streets, and halted in front of\nCaptain Leidesdorff’s residence, where the governor and suite entered,\nand was presented to a number of ladies, who welcomed him to the shores\nof California. After which a large portion of the procession\naccompanied the governor, on horseback, to the mission of San Francisco\nDolores, several miles in the country, and returned to an excellent\ncollation prepared by the committee of arrangements, at the house of\nCaptain Leidesdorff. After the cloth was removed, the usual number of\nregular toasts, prepared by the committee of arrangements, and numerous\nvolunteer sentiments by the members of the company, were drunk with\nmany demonstrations of enthusiasm, and several speeches were made. In\nresponse to a complimentary toast, Commodore Stockton made an eloquent\naddress of an hour’s length. The toasts given in English were\ntranslated into Spanish, and those given in Spanish were translated\ninto English. A ball in honour of the occasion was given by the\ncommittee of arrangements in the evening, which was attended by all the\nladies, native and foreign, in the town and vicinity, the naval\nofficers attached to the three ships of war, and the captains of the\nmerchant vessels lying in the harbour. So seductive were the\nfestivities of the day and the pleasures of the dance, that they were\nnot closed until a late hour of the night, or rather until an early\nhour in the morning.",
        "Among the numerous vessels of many nations at anchor in the harbour is\na Russian brig from Sitca, the central port of the Russian-American Fur\nCompany, on the northwestern coast of this continent. She is commanded\nby Lieutenant Ruducoff of the Russian navy, and is here to be freighted\nwith wheat to supply that settlement with breadstuff. Sitca is situated\nin a high northern latitude, and has a population of some four or five\nthousand inhabitants. A large portion of these, I conjecture, are\nchristianized natives or Indians. Many of the crew of this vessel are\nthe aborigines of the country to which she belongs, and from which she\nlast sailed. I noticed, however, from an inscription, that the brig was\nbuilt at Newburyport, Massachusetts, showing that the autocrat of all\nthe Russias is tributary, to some extent, to the free Yankees of New\nEngland for his naval equipment. On the 11th of October, by invitation\nof Lieutenant Ruducoff, in company of Mr. Jacob and Captain\nLeidesdorff, I dined on board this vessel. The Russian customs are in\nsome respects peculiar. Soon after we reached the vessel and were shown\ninto the cabin, a lunch was served up. This consisted of a variety of\ndried and smoked fish, pickled fish-roe, and other hyperborean pickles,\nthe nature of which, whether animal or vegetable, I could not\ndetermine. Various wines and liquors accompanied this lunch, the\ndiscussion of which lasted until an Indian servant, a native of the\nnorth-pole, or thereabouts, announced dinner. We were then shown into a\nhandsomely furnished dining-cabin, where the table was spread. The\ndinner consisted of several courses, some of which were peculiarly\nRussian or Sitcan, and I regret that my culinary knowledge is not equal\nto the task of describing them, for the benefit of epicures of a more\nsouthern region than the place of their invention. They were certainly\nvery delightful to the palate. The afternoon glided away most\nagreeably.",
        "On the 12th of October, Captain Fremont, with a number of volunteers\ndestined for the south, to co-operate with Commodore Stockton in the\nsuppression of the reported rebellion at Los Angeles, arrived at San\nFrancisco from the Sacramento. I had previously offered my services,\nand Mr. Jacob had done the same, to Commodore Stockton, as volunteers\nin this expedition, if they were necessary or desirable. They were now\nrepeated. Although travellers in the country, we were American\ncitizens, and we felt under obligation to assist in defending the flag\nof our country wherever it had been planted by proper authority. At\nthis time we were given to understand that a larger force than was\nalready organised was not considered necessary for the expedition.",
