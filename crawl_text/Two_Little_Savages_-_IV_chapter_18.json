        "The Sanger Witch",
        "  The Sanger Witch dwelt in the bend of the creek,\n  And neither could read nor write;\n  But she knew in a day what few knew in a week,\n  For hers was the second sight.\n  “Read?” said she, “I am double read;\n  You fools of the ink and pen\n  Count never the eggs, but the sticks of the nest,\n  See the clothes, not the souls of men.”",
        "  –Cracked Jimmy’s Ballad of Sanger.",
        "The boys set out for Caleb’s. It was up the creek away from the camp\nground. As they neared the bend they saw a small log shanty, with some\npoultry and a pig at the door.",
        "“That’s where the witch lives,” said Sam.",
        "“Who–old Granny de Neuville?”",
        "“Yep, and she just loves me. Oh, yes; about the same way an old hen\nloves a Chicken-hawk. ’Pears to me she sets up nights to love me.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Oh, I guess it started with the pigs. No, let’s see: first about the\ntrees. Da chopped off a lot of Elm trees that looked terrible nice\nfrom her windy. She’s awful queer about a tree. She hates to see ’em\ncut down, an’ that soured her same as if she owned ’em. Then there\nwuz the pigs. You see, one winter she was awful hard up, an’ she had\ntwo pigs worth, maybe, $5.00 each–anyway, she said they was, an’ she\nought to know, for they lived right in the shanty with her–an’ she\ncome to Da (I guess she had tried every one else first) an’ Da he\nsqueezed her down an’ got the two pigs for $7.00. He al’ays does that.\nThen he comes home an’ says to Ma, ’Seems to me the old lady is\npretty hard put. ’Bout next Saturday you take two sacks of flour and\nsome pork an’ potatoes around an’ see that she is fixed up right.’\nDa’s al’ays doin’ them things, too, on the quiet. So Ma goes with\nabout $15.00 worth o’ truck. The old witch was kinder ’stand off.’\nShe didn’t say much. Ma was goin’ slow, not knowin’ just whether to\ngive the stuff out an’ out, or say it could be worked for next year,\nor some other year, when there was two moons, or some time when the\nwork was all done. Well, the old witch said mighty little until the\nstuff was all put in the cellar, then she grabs up a big stick an’\nbreaks out at Ma:",
        "“’Now you git out o’ my house, you dhirty, sthuck-up thing. I ain’t\ntakin’ no charity from the likes o’ you. That thing you call your\nhusband robbed me o’ my pigs, an’ we ain’t any more’n square now, so\ngit out an’ don’t you dar set fut in my house agin’.",
        "“Well, she was sore on us when Da bought her pigs, but she was five\ntimes wuss after she clinched the groceries. ’Pears like they soured\non her stummick.”",
        "“What a shame, the old wretch,” said Yan, with ready sympathy for the\nRaftens.",
        "“No,” replied Sam; “she’s only queer. There’s lots o’ folk takes her\nside. But she’s awful queer. She won’t have a tree cut if she can help\nit, an’ when the flowers come in the spring she goes out in the woods\nand sets down beside ’em for hours an’ calls ’em ’Me beauty–me little\nbeauty,’ an’ she just loves the birds. When the boys want to rile her\nthey get a sling-shot an’ shoot the birds in her garden an’ she just\ngoes crazy. She pretty near starves herself every winter trying to\nfeed all the birds that come around. She has lots of ’em to feed right\nout o’ her hand. Da says they think its an old pine root, but she has\na way o’ coaxin’ ’em that’s awful nice. There she’ll stand in freezin’\nweather calling them ’Me beauties’.",
        "“You see that little windy in the end?” he continued, as they came\nclose to the witch’s hut. “Well, that’s the loft, an’ it’s full o’ all\nsorts o’ plants an’ roots.”",
        "“What for?”",
        "“Oh, for medicine. She’s great on hairbs.”",
        "“Oh, yes, I remember now Biddy did say that her Granny was a herb\ndoctor.”",
        "“Doctor? She ain’t much of a doctor, but I bet she knows every plant\nthat grows in the woods, an’ they’re sure strong after they’ve been up\nthere for a year, with the cat sleepin’ on them.”",
        "“I wish I could go and see her.”",
        "“Guess we can,” was the reply.",
        "“Doesn’t she know you?”",
        "“Yes, but watch me fix her,” drawled Sam. “There ain’t nothin’ she\nlikes better’n a sick pusson.”",
        "Sam stopped now, rolled up his sleeves and examined both arms,\napparently without success, for he then loosed his suspenders, dropped\nhis pants, and proceeded to examine his legs. Of course, all boys\nhave more or less cuts and bruises in various stages of healing. Sam\nselected his best, just below the knee, a scratch from a nail in the\nfence. He had never given it a thought before, but now he “reckoned\nit would do.” With a lead pencil borrowed from Yan he spread a hue\nof mortification all around it, a green butternut rind added the\nunpleasant yellowish-brown of human decomposition, and the result\nwas a frightful looking plague spot. By chewing some grass he made a\nyellowish-green dye and expectorated this on the handkerchief which he\nbound on the sore. He then got a stick and proceeded to limp painfully\ntoward the witch’s abode. As they drew near, the partly open door was\nslammed with ominous force. Sam, quite unabashed, looked at Yan and\nwinked, then knocked. The bark of a small dog answered. He knocked\nagain. A sound now of some one moving within, but no answer. A third\ntime he knocked, then a shrill voice: “Get out o’ that. Get aff my\nplace, you dirthy young riff-raff.”",
        "Sam grinned at Yan. Then drawling a little more than usual, he said:",
        "“It’s a poor boy, Granny. The doctors can’t do nothin’ for him,” which\nlast, at least, was quite true.",
        "There was no reply, so Sam made bold to open the door. There sat the\nold woman glowering with angry red eyes across the stove, a cat in her\nlap, a pipe in her mouth, and a dog growling toward the strangers.",
        "“Ain’t you Sam Raften?” she asked fiercely.",
        "“Yes, marm. I get hurt on a nail in the fence. They say you kin git\nblood-p’isinin’ that way,” said Sam, groaning a little and trying to\nlook interesting. The order to “get out” died on the witch’s lips. Her\ngood old Irish heart warmed to the sufferer. After all, it was rather\npleasant to have the enemy thus humbly seek her aid, so she muttered:",
        "“Le’s see it.”",
        "Sam was trying amid many groans to expose the disgusting mess he had\nmade around his knee, when a step was heard outside. The door opened\nand in walked Biddy.",
        "She and Yan recognized each other at once. The one had grown much\nlonger, the other much broader since the last meeting, but the\ngreeting was that of two warm-hearted people glad to see each other\nonce more.",
        "“An’ how’s yer father an’ yer mother an’ how is all the fambily? Law,\ndo ye mind the Cherry Lung-balm we uster make? My, but we wuz greenies\nthen! Ye mind, I uster tell ye about Granny? Well, here she is.\nGranny, this is Yan. Me an’ him hed lots o’ fun together when I\n’resided’ with his mamma, didn’t we, Yan? Now, Granny’s the one to\ntell ye all about the plants.”",
        "A long groan from Sam now called all attention his way.",
        "“Well, if it ain’t Sam Raften,” said Biddy coldly.",
        "“Yes, an’ he’s deathly sick,” added Granny. “Their own docther guv him\nup an said mortal man couldn’t save him nohow, so he jest hed to come\nto me.”",
        "Another long groan was ample indorsement.",
        "“Le’s see. Gimme my scissors, Biddy; I’ll hev to cut the pant leg\naff.”",
        "“No, no,” Sam blurted out with sudden vigour, dreading the\nconsequences at home. “I kin roll it up.”",
        "“Thayer, thot’ll do. Now I say,” said the witch. “Yes, sure enough,\nthayer is proud flesh. I moight cut it out,” said she, fumbling\nin her pocket (Sam supposed for a knife, and made ready to dash for\nthe door), “but le’s see, no–that would be a fool docther trick. I\nkin git on without.”",
        "“Yes, sure,” said Sam, clutching at the idea, “that’s just what a fool\ndoctor would do, but you kin give me something to take that’s far\nbetter.”",
        "“Well, sure an’ I kin,” and Yan and Sam breathed more freely.\n“Shwaller this, now,” and she offered him a tin cup of water into\nwhich she spilled some powder of dry leaves. Sam did so. “An’ you\ntake this yer bundle and bile it in two gallons of wather and drink a\nglassful ivery hour, an’ hev a loive chicken sphlit with an axe an’\nlaid hot on the place twicet ivery day, till the proud flesh goes, an’\nit’ll be all right wid ye–a fresh chicken ivery toime, moind ye.”",
        "“Wouldn’t–turkeys–do–better?” groaned Sam, feebly. “I’m me mother’s\npet, Granny, an’ expense ain’t any objek\"–a snort that may have meant\nmortal agony escaped him.",
        "“Niver moind, now. Sure we won’t talk of yer father an’ mother;\nthey’re punished pretty bad already. Hiven forbid they don’t lose\nthe rest o’ ye fur their sins. It ain’t meself that ’ud bear ony\nill-will.”",
        "A long groan cut short what looked like a young sermon.",
        "“What’s the plant, Granny?” asked Yan, carefully avoiding Sam’s gaze.",
        "“Shure, an’ it grows in the woods.”",
        "“Yes, but I want to know what it’s like and what it’s called.”",
        "“Shure, ’tain’t like nothin’ else. It’s just like itself, an’ it’s\ncalled Witch-hazel.",
        "  “’Witch-hazel blossoms in the faal,\n  To cure the chills and Fayvers aall,’",
        "“as cracked Jimmy says.”",
        "“I’ll show you some av it sometime,” said Biddy.",
        "“Can it be made into Lung-balm?” asked Yan, mischievously.",
        "“I guess we’ll have to go now,” Sam feebly put in. “I’m feeling much\nbetter. Where’s my stick? Here, Yan, you kin carry my medicine, an’\nbe very keerful of it.”",
        "Yan took the bundle, not daring to look Sam in the face.",
        "Granny bade them both come back again, and followed to the door with a\nhearty farewell. At the same moment she said:",
        "“Howld on!” Then she went to the one bed in the room, which also was\nthe house, turned down the clothes, and in the middle exposed a lot of\nrosy apples. She picked out two of the best and gave one to each of\nthe boys.",
        "“Shure, Oi hev to hoide them thayer fram the pig, for they’re the\nfoinest iver grew.”",
        "“I know they are,” whispered Sam, as he limped out of hearing, “for\nher son Larry stole them out of our orchard last fall. They’re the\nonly kind that keeps over. They’re the best that grow, but a trifle\ntoo warm just now.”",
        "“Good-by, and thank you much,” said Yan.",
        "“I-feel-better-already,” drawled Sam. “That tired feeling has left me,\nan’ sense tryin’ your remedy I have took no other,” but added aside,\n“I wish I could throw up the stuff before it pisens me,” and then,\nwith a keen eye to the picturesque effect, he wanted to fling his\nstick away and bound into the woods.",
        "It was all Yan could do to make him observe some of the decencies\nand limp a little till out of sight. As it was, the change was quite\nmarked and the genial old witch called loudly on Biddy to see with\nher own eyes how quickly she had helped young Raften “afther all the\ndochters in the country hed giv him up.”",
        "“Now for Caleb Clark, Esq., Q.C.,” said Sam.",
        "“Q.C.?” inquired his friend.",
        "“Some consider it means Queen’s Counsel, an’ some claims as it stands\nfor Queer Cuss. One or other maybe is right.”",
        "“You’re stepping wonderfully for a crippled boy the doctors have given\nup,” remarked Yan.",
        "“Yes; that’s the proud flesh in me right leg that’s doin’ the high\nsteppin’. The left one is jest plain laig.”",
        "“Let’s hide this somewhere till we get back,” and Yan held up the\nbundle of Witch-hazel.",
        "“I’ll hide that,” said Sam, and he hurled the bundle afar into the\ncreek.",
        "“Oh, Sam, that’s mean. Maybe she wants it herself.”",
        "“Pooh, that’s all the old brush is good for. I done more’n me duty\nwhen I drank that swill. I could fairly taste the cat in it.”",
        "“What’ll you tell her next time?”",
        "“Well, I’ll tell her I put the sticks in the right place an’ where\nthey done the most good. I soaked ’em in water an’ took as much as I\nwanted of the flooid.",
        "“She’ll see for herself I really did pull through, and will be a\nblamed sight happier than if I drank her old pisen brushwood an’ had\nto send for a really truly doctor.”",
        "Yan was silenced, but not satisfied. It seemed discourteous to throw\nthe sticks away–so soon, anyway; besides, he had curiosity to know\njust what they were and how they acted.",
