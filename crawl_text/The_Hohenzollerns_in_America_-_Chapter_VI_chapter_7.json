        "It is a year or nearly a year since I wrote in my memoirs,\nand I only add to them now because things have happened\nwhich mean that I shall never write any more.",
        "Mr. Peters and I were married last autumn. He asked me\nif I would marry him the day that he held the arm of my\nchair in the boarding house where we used to live. At\nfirst I never thought that Uncle William would permit\nit, because of the hopeless difference of birth. But it\nturned out that there was no difficulty at all. Uncle’s\nmind was always so wonderful that he could find a way\nout of anything provided that he wanted to. So he conferred\non Mr. Peters an Order that raised him right up in birth\nso that he came level with me. Uncle said that he could\nhave lifted him higher still if need be but that as I\nwas only, in our old life, of a younger branch of the\nfamily, it was not necessary to lift Mr. Peters to the\nvery top. He takes precedence, Uncle said, just below\nUncle Henry of Prussia and just above an Archbishop.",
        "It is so pleasant to think–now that poor Uncle William\nis gone–that my marriage was with his full consent.",
        "But even after Uncle William had given his formal consent,\nI didn’t want to get married till I could leave him\nsafely. Only he got along so well in his “territory” of\nthe Bowery from the very start that he was soon quite\nall right. He used to go out every morning with his\ntrayful of badges and pencils and shoe-strings and he\nwas a success at once. All the people got to know him by\nsight and they would say when they saw him, “Here comes\nthe Emperor,” or “Here comes Old Dutch,” and very often\nthere would be quite a little crowd round him buying his\nthings. Uncle regarded himself always as conferring a\ngreat dignity on any one that he sold a badge to, but he\nwas very capricious and he had certain buttons and badges\nthat he would only part with as a very special favour\nand honour. Uncle got on so fast that presently Cousin\nFerdinand decided that it would be all right to know him\nagain and so he came over and made a reconciliation and\ntook away Uncle’s money,–it was all in small coins,–in\na bag to invest for him.",
        "So when everything was all right with Uncle William, Mr.\nPeters and I were married and it was on our wedding\nmorning that Uncle conferred the Order on my husband\nwhich made me very proud. That was a year ago, and since\nthen we have lived in a very fine place of our own with\nfour rooms, all to ourselves, and a gallery at the back.\nI have cooked all the meals and done all the work of our\napartment, except just at the time when our little boy\nwas born. We both think he is a very wonderful child. At\nfirst I wanted to call him after the Hohenzollerns and\nto name him William Frederick Charles Mary Augustus\nFrancis Felix, but somehow it seemed out of place and so\nwe have called him simply Joe Peters. I think it sounds\nbetter. Uncle William drew up an act of abnegation of\nJoe, whereby he gives up all claim to a reversion of the\nthrone of Prussia, Brunswick and Waldeck. I was sorry\nfor this at first but Uncle said that all the Hohenzollerns\nhad done it and had made just as great a sacrifice as\nJoe has in doing it. But my husband says that under the\nconstitution of the United States, Joe can be President,\nwhich I think I will like better.",
        "It was one day last week that Uncle William met with the\naccident that caused his death. He had walked far away\nfrom his “territory” up to where the Great Park is,\nbecause in this lovely spring weather he liked to wander\nabout. And he came to where there was a great crowd of\npeople gathered to see the unveiling of a new monument.\nIt is called the Lusitania Monument and it is put up in\nmemory of the people that were lost when one of our war\nboats fought the English cruiser Lusitania. There were\na lot of soldiers lining the streets and regiments of\ncavalry riding between. And it seems that when Uncle\nWilliam saw the crowd and the soldiers he was drawn nearer\nand nearer by a sort of curiosity, and when he saw the\ngreat white veil drawn away from the monument, and read\nthe word “Lusitania” that is carved in large letters\nacross the base, he screamed out in a sudden fear, and\nclashed among the horses of the cavalry and was ridden\ndown.",
        "They carried him to the hospital, but he never spoke\nagain, and died on the next day but one. My husband would\nnot let me go to see him, as he was not conscious and it\ncould do no good, but after Uncle William was dead they\nlet me see him in his coffin.",
        "Lying there he seemed such a pitiful and ghastly lump of\nclay that it seemed strange that he could, in his old\nlife, have vexed the world as he did.",
        "I had thought that when Uncle William died there would\nhave been long accounts of him in the papers; at least\nI couldn’t help thinking so, by a sort of confusion of\nmind, as it is hard to get used to things as they are\nand to remember that our other life is unknown here and\nthat we are known only as ourselves.",
        "But though I looked in all the papers I could find nothing\nexcept one little notice, which I cut out of an evening\npaper and which I put in here as a conclusion to my\nmemoirs.",
        "   Unique Character of the East Side Passes Away",
        "   A unique and interesting character, a familiar figure\n   of the East Side of the City, has been lost from our\n   streets with the death of William Hohen lost Thursday\n   in the Pauper Hospital, to which he had been brought\n   as the result of injuries sustained in a street accident\n   at the Lusitania celebration. Hohen, who was about\n   sixty-five years of age, was an immigrant out of\n   Germany after the troubles of the Great War. He had\n   been for a year or more a street pedler on the Bowery,\n   where he sold souvenir buttons and various little\n   trinkets. The old man appears to have been the victim\n   of a harmless hallucination whereby he thought himself\n   a person of Royal distinction and in his fancy converted\n   the box of wares that he carried into Orders of Chivalry\n   and decorations of Knighthood. The effect of this\n   strange fancy was heightened by an attempt at military\n   bearing which, comic though it was in so old and ragged\n   a figure, was not without a touch of pathos. Some\n   fancied resemblance to the former Kaiser had earned\n   for Hohen the designation of the “Emperor,” of which\n   he appeared inordinately proud. But those who knew\n   Hohen by sight assure us that the resemblance to the\n   former ruler of Germany, who with all his faults made\n   a splendid and imposing appearance, was of a purely\n   superficial character. It would, alas! have been well\n   for the world if the lot of William Hohenzollern had\n   fallen on the lines of the simple and pathetic “Emperor\"\n   of the Bowery.",
        "II.–With the Bolsheviks in Berlin",
        "Two years ago as my readers will remember,–but of course\nthey don’t,–I made a secret visit to Germany during the\nheight of the war. It was obviously quite impossible at\nthat time to disclose the means whereby I made my way\nacross the frontier. I therefore adopted the familiar\nliterary device of professing to have been transported\nto Germany in a dream. In that state I was supposed to\nbe conducted about the country by my friend Count Boob\nvon Boobenstein, whom I had known years before as a waiter\nin Toronto, to see GERMANY FROM WITHIN, and to report\nupon it in the Allied press.",
        "What I wrote attracted some attention. So the German\nGovernment–feeling, perhaps, that the prestige of their\nown spy system was at stake–published a white paper,\n–or a green paper,–I forget which,–in denial of all\nmy adventures and disclosures. In this they proved (1)\nthat all entry into Germany by dreams had been expressly\nforbidden of the High General Command; (2) that astral\nbodies were prohibited and (3) that nobody else but the\nKaiser was allowed to have visions. They claimed therefore\n(1) that my article was a fabrication and (2) that for\nall they knew it was humorous. There the matter ended\nuntil it can be taken up at the General Peace Table.",
        "But as soon as I heard that the People’s Revolution had\ntaken place in Berlin I determined to make a second visit.",
        "This time I had no difficulty about the frontier whatever.\nI simply put on the costume of a British admiral and\nwalked in.",
        "“Three Cheers for the British Navy!” said the first\nofficial whom I met. He threw his hat in the air and the\npeasants standing about raised a cheer. It was my first\nview of the marvellous adaptability of this great people.\nI noticed that many of them were wearing little buttons\nwith pictures of Jellicoe and Beatty.",
        "At my own request I was conducted at once to the nearest\nrailway station.",
        "“So your Excellency wishes to go to Berlin?” said the\nstationmaster.",
        "“Yes,” I replied, “I want to see something of the people’s\nrevolution.”",
        "The stationmaster looked at his watch.",
        "“That Revolution is over,” he said.",
        "“Too bad!” I exclaimed.",
        "“Not at all. A much better one is in progress, quite the\nbest Revolution that we have had. It is called–Johann,\nhand me that proclamation of yesterday–the Workmen and\nSoldiers Revolution.”",
        "“What’s it about?” I asked.",
        "“The basis of it,” said the stationmaster, “or what we\nGermans call the Fundamental Ground Foundation, is\nuniversal love. They hanged all the leaders of the Old\nRevolution yesterday.”",
        "“When can I get a train?” I inquired.",
        "“Your Excellency shall have a special train at once,\nSir,” he continued with a sudden burst of feeling, while\na tear swelled in his eye. “The sight of your uniform\ncalls forth all our gratitude. My three sons enlisted in\nour German Navy. For four years they have been at Kiel,\ncomfortably fed, playing dominos. They are now at home\nall safe and happy. Had your brave navy relaxed its\nvigilance for a moment those boys might have had to go\nout on the sea, a thing they had never done. Please God,\"\nconcluded the good old man, removing his hat a moment,\n“no German sailor now will ever have to go to sea.”",
        "I pass over my journey to Berlin. Interesting and varied\nas were the scenes through which I passed they gave me\nbut little light upon the true situation of the country:\nindeed I may say without exaggeration that they gave me\nas little–or even more so–as the press reports of our\ntalented newspaper correspondents. The food situation\nseemed particularly perplexing. A well-to-do merchant\nfrom Bremen who travelled for some distance in my train\nassured me that there was plenty of food in Germany,\nexcept of course for the poor. Distress, he said, was\nconfined entirely to these. Similarly a Prussian gentleman\nwho looked very like a soldier, but who assured me with\nsome heat that he was a commercial traveller, told me\nthe same thing: There were no cases of starvation, he\nsaid, except among the very poor.",
        "The aspect of the people too, at the stations and in the\ntowns we passed, puzzled me. There were no uniforms, no\nsoldiers. But I was amazed at the number of commercial\ntravellers, Lutheran ministers, photographers, and so\nforth, and the odd resemblance they presented, in spite\nof their innocent costumes, to the arrogant and ubiquitous\nmilitary officers whom I had observed on my former visit.",
        "But I was too anxious to reach Berlin to pay much attention\nto the details of my journey.",
        "Even when I at last reached the capital, I arrived as I\nhad feared, too late.",
        "“Your Excellency,” said a courteous official at the\nrailway station, to whom my naval uniform acted as a\nsufficient passport. “The Revolution of which you speak\nis over. Its leaders were arrested yesterday. But you\nshall not be disappointed. There is a better one. It is\ncalled the Comrades’ Revolution of the Bolsheviks. The\nchief Executive was installed yesterday.”",
        "“Would it be possible for me to see him?” I asked.",
        "“Nothing simpler, Excellency,” he continued as a tear\nrose in his eye. “My four sons,–”",
        "“I know,” I said; “your four sons are in the German Navy.\nIt is enough. Can you take me to the Leader?”",
        "“I can and will,” said the official. “He is sitting now\nin the Free Palace of all the German People, once usurped\nby the Hohenzollern Tyrant. The doors are guarded by\nmachine guns. But I can take you direct from here through\na back way. Come.”",
        "We passed out from the station, across a street and\nthrough a maze of little stairways, and passages into\nthe heart of the great building that had been the offices\nof the Imperial Government.",
        "“Enter this room. Do not knock,” said my guide. “Good bye.”",
        "In another moment I found myself face to face with the\nchief comrade of the Bolsheviks.",
        "He gave a sudden start as he looked at me, but instantly\ncollected himself.",
        "He was sitting with his big boots up on the mahogany\ndesk, a cigar at an edgeways angle in his mouth. His hair\nunder his sheepskin cap was shaggy, and his beard stubbly\nand unshaven. His dress was slovenly and there was a big\nknife in his belt. A revolver lay on the desk beside him.\nI had never seen a Bolshevik before but I knew at sight\nthat he must be one.",
        "“You say you were here in Berlin once before?” he\nquestioned, and he added before I had time to answer:\n“When you speak don’t call me ’Excellency’ or ’Sereneness’\nor anything of that sort; just call me ’brother’ or\n’comrade.’ This is the era of freedom. You’re as good as\nI am, or nearly.”",
        "“Thank you,” I said.",
        "“Don’t be so damn polite,” he snarled. “No good comrade\never says ’thank you.’ So you were here in Berlin before?”",
        "“Yes,” I answered, “I was here writing up Germany from\nWithin in the middle of the war.”",
        "“The war, the war!” he murmured, in a sort of wail or\nwhine. “Take notice, comrade, that I weep when I speak\nof it. If you write anything about me be sure to say that\nI cried when the war was mentioned. We Germans have been\nso misjudged. When I think of the devastation of France\nand Belgium I weep.”",
        "He drew a greasy, red handkerchief from his pocket and\nbegan to sob. “To think of the loss of all those English\nmerchant ships!”",
        "“Oh, you needn’t worry,” I said, “it’s all going to be\npaid for.”",
        "“Oh I hope so, I do hope so,” said the Bolshevik chief.\n“What a regret it is to us Germans to think that\nunfortunately we are not able to help pay for it; but\nyou English–you are so generous–how much we have admired\nyour noble hearts–so kind, so generous to the\nvanquished...”",
        "His voice had subsided into a sort of whine.",
        "But at this moment there was a loud knocking at the door.\nThe Bolshevik hastily wiped the tears from his face and\nput away his handkerchief.",
        "“How do I look?” he asked anxiously. “Not humane, I hope?\nNot soft?”",
        "“Oh, no,” I said, “quite tough.”",
        "“That’s good,” he answered. “That’s good. But am I tough\nENOUGH?”",
        "He hastily shoved his hands through his hair.",
        "“Quick,” he said, “hand me that piece of chewing tobacco.\nNow then. Come in!”",
        "The door swung open.",
        "A man in a costume much like the leader’s swaggered into\nthe room. He had a bundle of papers in his hands, and\nseemed to be some sort of military secretary.",
        "“Ha! comrade!” he said, with easy familiarity. “Here are\nthe death warrants!”",
        "“Death warrants!” said the Bolshevik. “Of the leaders of\nthe late Revolution? Excellent! And a good bundle of\nthem! One moment while I sign them.”",
        "He began rapidly signing the warrants, one after the\nother.",
        "“Comrade,” said the secretary in a surly tone, “you are\nnot chewing tobacco!”",
        "“Yes I am, yes I am,” said the leader, “or, at least, I\nwas just going to.”",
        "He bit a huge piece out of his plug, with what seemed to\nme an evident distaste, and began to chew furiously.",
        "“It is well,” said the other. “Remember comrade, that\nyou are watched. It was reported last night to the\nExecutive Committee of the Circle of the Brothers that\nyou chewed no tobacco all day yesterday. Be warned,\ncomrade. This is a free and independent republic. We will\nstand for no aristocratic nonsense. But whom have you\nhere?” he added, breaking off in his speech, as if he\nnoticed me for the first time. “What dog is this?”",
        "“Hush,” said the leader, “he is a representative of the\nforeign press, a newspaper reporter.”",
        "“Your pardon,” said the secretary. “I took you by your\ndress for a prince. A representative of the great and\nenlightened press of the Allies, I presume. How deeply\nwe admire in Germany the press of England! Let me kiss\nyou.”",
        "“Oh, don’t trouble,” I said, “it’s not worth while.”",
        "“Say, at least, when you write to your paper, that I\noffered to kiss you, will you not?”",
        "Meantime, the leader had finished signing the papers.\nThe secretary took them and swung on his heels with\nsomething between a military bow and a drunken swagger.\n“Remember, comrade,” he said in a threatening tone as he\npassed out, “you are watched.”",
        "The Bolshevik leader looked after him with something of\na shudder.",
        "“Excuse me a moment,” he said, “while I go and get rid\nof this tobacco.”",
        "He got up from his chair and walked away towards the door\nof an inner room. As he did so, there struck me something\nstrangely familiar in his gait and figure. Conceal it as\nhe might, there was still the stiff wooden movement of\na Prussian general beneath his assumed swagger. The poise\nof his head still seemed to suggest the pointed helmet\nof the Prussian. I could without effort imagine a military\ncloak about his shoulders instead of his Bolshevik\nsheepskin.",
        "Then, all in a moment, as he re-entered the room, I\nrecalled exactly who he was.",
        "“My friend,” I said, reaching out my hand, “pardon me\nfor not knowing you at once. I recognize you now...”",
        "“Hush,” said the Bolshevik. “Don’t speak! I never saw\nyou in my life.”",
        "“Nonsense,” I said, “I knew you years ago in Canada when\nyou were disguised as a waiter. And you it was who\nconducted me through Germany two years ago when I made\nmy war visit. You are no more a Bolshevik than I am. You\nare General Count Boob von Boobenstein.”",
        "The general sank down in his chair, his face pale beneath\nits plaster of rouge.",
        "“Hush!” he said. “If they learn it, it is death.”",
        "“My dear Boob,” I said, “not a word shall pass my lips.”",
        "The general grasped my hand. “The true spirit,” he said,\n“the true English comradeship; how deeply we admire it\nin Germany!”",
        "“I am sure you do,” I answered. “But tell me, what is\nthe meaning of all this? Why are you a Bolshevik?”",
        "“We all are,” said the count, dropping his assumed rough\nvoice, and speaking in a tone of quiet melancholy. “It’s\nthe only thing to be. But come,” he added, getting up\nfrom his chair, “I took you once through Berlin in war\ntime. Let me take you out again and show you Berlin under\nthe Bolsheviks.”",
        "“I shall be only too happy,” I said.",
        "“I shall leave my pistols and knives here,” said\nBoobenstein, “and if you will excuse me I shall change\nmy costume a little. To appear as I am would excite too\nmuch enthusiasm. I shall walk out with you in the simple\ncostume of a gentleman. It’s a risky thing to do in\nBerlin, but I’ll chance it.”",
        "The count retired, and presently returned dressed in the\nquiet bell-shaped purple coat, the simple scarlet tie,\nthe pea-green hat and the white spats that mark the German\ngentleman all the world over.",
        "“Bless me, Count,” I said, “you look just like Bernstorff.”",
        "“Hush,” said the count. “Don’t mention him. He’s here in\nBerlin.”",
        "“What’s he doing?” I asked.",
        "“He’s a Bolshevik; one of our leaders; he’s just been\nelected president of the Scavengers Union. They say he’s\nthe very man for it. But come along, and, by the way,\nwhen we get into the street talk English and only English.\nThere’s getting to be a prejudice here against German.”",
        "We passed out of the door and through the spacious\ncorridors and down the stairways of the great building.\nAll about were little groups of ferocious looking men,\ndressed like stage Russians, all chewing tobacco and\nredolent of alcohol.",
        "“Who are all these people?” I said to the count in a low\nvoice.",
        "“Bolsheviks,” he whispered. “At least they aren’t really.\nYou see that group in the corner?",
        "“The ones with the long knives,” I said.",
        "“Yes. They are, or at least they were, the orchestra of\nthe Berlin Opera. They are now the Bolshevik Music\nCommission. They are here this morning to see about\ngetting their second violinist hanged.”",
        "“Why not the first?” I asked.",
        "“They had him hanged yesterday. Both cases are quite\nclear. The men undoubtedly favoured the war: one, at\nleast, of them openly spoke in disparagement of President\nWilson. But come along. Let me show you our new city.”",
        "We stepped out upon the great square which faced the\nbuilding. How completely it was changed from the Berlin\nthat I had known! My attention was at once arrested by\nthe new and glaring signboards at the shops and hotels,\nand the streamers with mottos suspended across the streets.\nI realised as I read them the marvellous adaptability of\nthe German people and their magnanimity towards their\nenemies. Conspicuous in huge lettering was HOTEL PRESIDENT\nWILSON, and close beside it CABARET QUEEN MARY: ENGLISH\nDANCING. The square itself, which I remembered as the\nKaiserplatz, was now renamed on huge signboards GRAND\nSQUARE OF THE BRITISH NAVY. Not far off one noticed the\nRESTAURANT MARSHAL FOCH, side by side with the ROOSEVELT\nSALOON and the BEER GARDEN GEORGE V.",
        "But the change in the appearance and costume of the men\nwho crowded the streets was even more notable. The uniforms\nand the pointed helmets of two years ago had vanished\nutterly. The men that one saw retained indeed their German\nstoutness, their flabby faces, and their big spectacles.\nBut they were now dressed for the most part in the costume\nof the Russian Monjik, while some of them appeared in\nAmerican wideawakes and Kentucky frock coats, or in\nEnglish stove-pipe hats and morning coats. A few of the\nstouter were in Highland costume.",
        "“You are amazed,” said Boobenstein as we stood a moment\nlooking at the motley crowd. “What does it mean?” I\nasked.",
        "“One moment,” said the count. “I will first summon a\ntaxi. It will be more convenient to talk as we ride.”",
        "He whistled and there presently came lumbering to our\nside an ancient and decrepit vehicle which would have\nexcited my laughter but for the seriousness of the count’s\nface. The top of the conveyance had evidently long since\nbeen torn off leaving, only the frame: the copper fastenings\nhad been removed: the tires were gone: the doors were\naltogether missing.",
        "“Our new 1919 model,” said the count. “Observe the\nabsence of the old-fashioned rubber tires, still used by\nthe less progressive peoples. Our chemists found that\nriding on rubber was bad for the eye-sight. Note, too,\nthe time saved by not having any doors.”",
        "“Admirable,” I said.",
        "We seated ourselves in the crazy conveyance, the count\nwhispered to the chauffeur an address which my ear failed\nto catch and we started off at a lumbering pace along\nthe street.",
        "“And now tell me, Boobenstein,” I said, “what does it\nall mean, the foreign signs and the strange costumes?”",
        "“My dear sir” he replied, “it is merely a further proof\nof our German adaptability. Having failed to conquer the\nworld by war we now propose to conquer it by the arts of\npeace: Those people, for example, that you see in Scotch\ncostumes are members of our Highland Mission about to\nstart for Scotland to carry to the Scotch the good news\nthat the war is a thing of the past, that the German\npeople forgive all wrongs and are prepared to offer a\nline of manufactured goods as per catalogue sample.”",
        "“Wonderful,” I said.",
        "“Is it not?” said Von Boobenstein. “We call it the From\nGermany Out movement. It is being organised in great\ndetail by our Step from Under Committee. They claim that\nalready four million German voters are pledged to forget\nthe war and to forgive the Allies. All that we now ask\nis to be able to put our hands upon the villains who made\nthis war, no matter how humble their station may be, and\nexecute them after a fair trial or possibly before.”",
        "The count spoke with great sincerity and earnestness.\n“But come along,” he added. “I want to drive you about\nthe city and show you a few of the leading features of\nour new national reconstruction. We can talk as we go.”",
        "“But Von Boobenstein,” I said, “you speak of the people\nwho made the war; surely you were all in favour of it?”",
        "“In favour of it! We were all against it.”",
        "“But the Kaiser,” I protested.",
        "“The Kaiser, my poor master! How he worked to prevent\nthe war! Day and night; even before anybody else had\nheard of it. ’Boob,’ he said to me one day with tears in\nhis eyes, ’this war must be stopped.’ ’Which war, your\nSerenity,’ I asked. ’The war that is coming next month,’\nhe answered, ’I look to you, Count Boobenstein,’ he\ncontinued, ’to bear witness that I am doing my utmost to\nstop it a month before the English Government has heard\nof it.’”",
        "While we were thus speaking our taxi had taken us out of\nthe roar and hubbub of the main thoroughfare into the\nquiet of a side street. It now drew up at the door of an\nunpretentious dwelling in the window of which I observed\na large printed card with the legend",
        "   REVEREND MR. TIBBITS\n   Private Tuition, English, Navigation,\n   and other Branches",
        "We entered and were shown by a servant into a little\nfront room where a venerable looking gentleman, evidently\na Lutheran minister, was seated in a corner at a writing\ntable. He turned on our entering and at the sight of the\nuniform which I wore jumped to his feet with a vigorous\nand unexpected oath.",
        "“It is all right, Admiral,” said Count Von Boobenstein.\n“My friend is not really a sailor.”",
        "“Ah!” said the other. “You must excuse me. The sight of\nthat uniform always gives me the jumps.”",
        "He came forward to shake hands and as the light fell upon\nhim I recognized the grand old seaman, perhaps the greatest\nsailor that Germany has ever produced or ever will,\nAdmiral Von Tirpitz.",
        "“My dear Admiral!” I said, warmly. “I thought you were\nout of the country. Our papers said that you had gone to\nSwitzerland for a rest.”",
        "“No,” said the Admiral. “I regret to say that I find it\nimpossible to get away.”",
        "“Your Allied press,” interjected the count, “has greatly\nmaligned our German patriots by reporting that they have\nleft the country. Where better could they trust themselves\nthan in the bosom of their own people? You noticed the\ncabman of our taxi? He was the former chancellor Von\nHertling. You saw that stout woman with the apple cart\nat the street corner? Frau Bertha Krupp Von Bohlen. All\nare here, helping to make the new Germany. But come,\nAdmiral, our visitor here is much interested in our plans\nfor the restoration of the Fatherland. I thought that\nyou might care to show him your designs for the new German\nNavy.”",
        "“A new navy!” I exclaimed, while my voice showed the\nastonishment and admiration that I felt. Here was this\ngallant old seaman, having just lost an entire navy,\nsetting vigorously to work to make another. “But how can\nGermany possibly find the money in her present state for\nthe building of new ships?”",
        "“There are not going to be any ships,” said the great\nadmiral. “That was our chief mistake in the past in\ninsisting on having ships in the navy. Ships, as the war\nhas shown us, are quite unnecessary to the German plan;\nthey are not part of what I may call the German idea.\nThe new navy will be built inland and elevated on piles\nand will consist–”",
        "But at this moment a great noise of shouting and sudden\ntumult could be heard as if from the street.",
        "“Some one is coming,” said the admiral hastily. “Reach\nme my Bible.”",
        "“No, no,” said the count, seizing me by the arm. “The\nsound comes from the Great Square. There is trouble. We\nmust hasten back at once.”",
        "He dragged me from the house.",
        "We perceived at once, as soon as we came into the main\nstreet again, from the excited demeanour of the crowd\nand from the anxious faces of people running to and fro\nthat something of great moment must be happening.",
        "Everybody was asking of the passer-by, “What is loose?\nWhat is it?” Ramshack taxis, similar to the one in which\nwe had driven, forced their way as best they could through\nthe crowded thoroughfare, moving evidently in the direction\nof the government buildings.",
        "“Hurry, hurry!” said Von Boobenstein, clutching me by\nthe arm, “or we shall be too late. It is as I feared.”",
        "“What is it?” I said; “what’s the matter?”",
        "“Fool that I was,” said the count, “to leave the building.\nI should have known. And in this costume I am helpless.”",
        "We made our way as best we could through the crowd of\npeople, who all seemed moving in the same direction, the\ncount, evidently a prey to the gravest anxiety, talking\nas if to himself and imprecating his own carelessness.",
        "We turned the corner of a street and reached the edge of\nthe great square. It was filled with a vast concourse of\npeople. At the very moment in which we reached it a great\nburst of cheering rose from the crowd. We could see over\nthe heads of the people that a man had appeared on the\nbalcony of the Government Building, holding a paper in\nhis hand. His appearance was evidently a signal for the\noutburst of cheers, accompanied by the waving of\nhandkerchiefs. The man raised his hand in a gesture of\nauthority. German training is deep. Silence fell instantly\nupon the assembled populace. We had time in the momentary\npause to examine, as closely as the distance permitted,\nthe figure upon the balcony. The man was dressed in the\nblue overall suit of a workingman. He was bare-headed.\nHis features, so far as we could tell, were those of a\nman well up in years, but his frame was rugged and\npowerful. Then he began to speak.",
        "“Friends and comrades!” he called out in a great voice\nthat resounded through the square. “I have to announce\nthat a New Revolution has been completed.”",
        "A wild cheer woke from the people.",
        "“The Bolsheviks’ Republic is overthrown. The Bolsheviks\nare aristocrats. Let them die.”",
        "“Thank Heaven for this costume!” I heard Count Boobenstein\nmurmur at my side. Then he seized his pea-green hat and\nwaved it in the air, shouting: “Down with the Bolsheviks!”",
        "All about us the cry was taken up.",
        "One saw everywhere in the crowd men pulling off their\nsheepskin coats and tramping them under foot with the\nshout, “Down with Bolshevism!” To my surprise I observed\nthat most of the men had on blue overalls beneath their\nRussian costumes. In a few moments the crowd seemed\ntransformed into a vast mass of mechanics.",
        "The speaker raised his hand again. “We have not yet\ndecided what the new Government will be\"–",
        "A great cheer from the people.",
        "“Nor do we propose to state who will be the leaders of it.”",
        "Renewed cheers.",
        "“But this much we can say. It is to be a free, universal,\nPan-German Government of love.”",
        "Cheers.",
        "“Meantime, be warned. Whoever speaks against it will be\nshot: anybody who dares to lift a finger will be hanged.\nA proclamation of Brotherhood will be posted all over\nthe city. If anybody dares to touch it, or to discuss\nit, or to look at or to be seen reading it, he will be\nhanged to a lamp post.”",
        "Loud applause greeted this part of the speech while the\nfaces of the people, to my great astonishment, seemed\nfilled with genuine relief and beamed with unmistakable\nenthusiasm.",
        "“And now,” continued the speaker, “I command you, you\ndogs, to disperse quietly and go home. Move quickly,\nswine that you are, or we shall open fire upon you with\nmachine guns.”",
        "With a last outburst of cheering the crowd broke and\ndispersed, like a vast theatre audience. On all sides\nwere expressions of joy and satisfaction. “Excellent,\nwunderschoen!” “He calls us dogs! That’s splendid. Swine!\nDid you hear him say ’Swine’? This is true German Government\nagain at last.”",
        "Then just for a moment the burly figure reappeared on\nthe balcony.",
        "“A last word!” he called to the departing crowd. “I\nomitted to say that all but one of the leaders of the\nlate government are already caught. As soon as we can\nlay our thumb on the Chief Executive rest assured that\nhe will be hanged.”",
        "“Hurrah!” shouted Boobenstein, waving his hat in the air.\nThen in a whisper to me: “Let us go,” he said, “while\nthe going is still good.”",
        "We hastened as quickly and unobtrusively as we could\nthrough the dispersing multitude, turned into a side\nstreet, and on a sign from the count entered a small\ncabaret or drinking shop, newly named, as its sign showed,\nTHE GLORY OF THE BRITISH COLONIES CAFE.",
        "The count with a deep sigh of relief ordered wine.",
        "“You recognized him, of course?” he said.",
        "“Who?” I asked. “You mean the big working-man that spoke?\nWho is he?”",
        "“So you didn’t recognize him?” said the count. “Well,\nwell, but of course all the rest did. Workingman! It is\nField Marshal Hindenburg. It means of course that the\nsame old crowd are back again. That was Ludendorf standing\nbelow. I saw it all at once. Perhaps it is the only way.\nBut as for me I shall not go back: I am too deeply\ncompromised: it would be death.”",
        "Boobenstein remained for a time in deep thought, his\nfingers beating a tattoo on the little table. Then he\nspoke.",
        "“Do you remember,” he said, “the old times of long ago\nwhen you first knew me?”",
        "“Very well, indeed,” I answered. “You were one of the\nGerman waiters, or rather, one of the German officers\ndisguised as waiters at McConkey’s Restaurant in Toronto.”",
        "“I was,” said the count. “I carried the beer on a little\ntray and opened oysters behind a screen. It was a\nwunderschoen life. Do you think, my good friend, you could\nget me that job again?”",
        "“Boobenstein,” I exclaimed, “I can get you reinstated at\nonce. It will be some small return for your kindness to\nme in Germany.”",
        "“Good,” said the count. “Let us sail at once for Canada.”",
        "“One thing, however,” I said. “You may not know that\nsince you left there are no longer beer waiters in Toronto\nbecause there is no beer. All is forbidden.”",
        "“Let me understand myself,” said the count in astonishment.\n“No beer!”",
        "“None whatever.”",
        "“Wine, then?”",
        "“Absolutely not. All drinking, except of water, is\nforbidden.”",
        "The count rose and stood erect. His figure seemed to\nregain all its old-time Prussian rigidity. He extended\nhis hand.",
        "“My friend,” he said. “I bid you farewell.”",
        "“Where are you going to?” I asked.",
        "“My choice is made,” said Von Boobenstein. “There are\nworse things than death. I am about to surrender myself\nto the German authorities.”",
        "III.–Afternoon Tea with the Sultan",
        "A Study of Reconstruction in Turkey",
        "On the very day following the events related in the last\nchapter, I was surprised and delighted to receive a\ntelegram which read “Come on to Constantinople and write\nUS up too.” From the signature I saw that the message\nwas from my old friend Abdul Aziz the Sultan.",
        "I had visited him–as of course my readers will instantly\nrecollect–during the height of the war, and the\ncircumstances of my departure had been such that I should\nhave scarcely ventured to repeat my visit without this\nexpress invitation. But on receipt of it, I set out at\nonce by rail for Constantinople.",
        "I was delighted to find that under the new order of things\nin going from Berlin to Constantinople it was no longer\nnecessary to travel through the barbarous and brutal\npopulations of Germany, Austria and Hungary. The way now\nruns, though I believe the actual railroad is the same,\nthrough the Thuringian Republic, Czecho-Slovakia and\nMagyaria. It was a source of deep satisfaction to see\nthe scowling and hostile countenances of Germans, Austrians\nand Hungarians replaced by the cheerful and honest faces\nof the Thuringians, the Czecho-Slovaks and the Magyarians.\nMoreover I was assured on all sides that if these faces\nare not perfectly satisfactory, they will be altered in\nany way required.",
        "It was very pleasant, too, to find myself once again in\nthe flagstoned halls of the Yildiz Kiosk, the Sultan’s\npalace. My little friend Abdul Aziz rose at once from\nhis cushioned divan under a lemon tree and came shuffling\nin his big slippers to meet me, a smile of welcome on\nhis face. He seemed, to my surprise, radiant with happiness.\nThe disasters attributed by the allied press to his\nunhappy country appeared to sit lightly on the little man.",
        "“How is everything going in Turkey?” I asked as we sat\ndown side by side on the cushions.",
        "“Splendid,” said Abdul. “I suppose you’ve heard that\nwe’re bankrupt?”",
        "“Bankrupt!” I exclaimed.",
        "“Yes,” continued the Sultan, rubbing his hands together\nwith positive enjoyment, “we can’t pay a cent: isn’t it\ngreat? Have some champagne?”",
        "He clapped his hands together and a turbaned attendant\nappeared with wine on a tray which he served into\nlong-necked glasses.",
        "“I’d rather have tea,” I said.",
        "“No, no, don’t take tea,” he protested. “We’ve practically\ncut out afternoon tea here. It’s part of our Turkish\nthrift movement. We’re taking champagne instead. Tell\nme, have you a Thrift Movement like that, where you come\nfrom–Canada, I think it is, isn’t it?”",
        "“Yes,” I answered, “we have one just like that.”",
        "“This war finance is glorious stuff, isn’t it?” continued\nthe Sultan. “How much do you think we owe?”",
        "“I haven’t an idea,” I said.",
        "“Wait a minute,” said Abdul. He touched a bell and at\nthe sound of it there came shuffling into the room my\nvenerable old acquaintance Toomuch Koffi, the Royal\nSecretary. But to my surprise he no longer wore his\npatriarchal beard, his flowing robe and his girdle. He\nwas clean shaven and close cropped and dressed in a short\njacket like an American bell boy.",
        "“You remember Toomuch, I think,” said Abdul. “I’ve\nreconstructed him a little, as you see.”",
        "“The Peace of Allah be upon thine head,” said Toomuch\nKoffi to the Sultan, commencing a deep salaam. “What wish\nsits behind thy forehead that thou shouldst ring the bell\nfor this humble creature of clay to come into the sunlight\nof thy presence? Tell me, O Lord, if perchance–”",
        "“Here, here,” interrupted the Sultan impatiently, “cut\nall that stuff out, please. That ancient courtesy business\nwon’t do, not if this country is to reconstruct itself\nand come abreast of the great modern democracies. Say to\nme simply ’What’s the trouble?\"’",
        "Toomuch bowed, and Abdul continued. “Look in your tablets\nand see how much our public debt amounts to in American\ndollars.”",
        "The secretary drew forth his tablets and bowed his head\na moment in some perplexity over the figures that were\nscribbled on them. “Multiplication,” I heard him murmur,\n“is an act of the grace of heaven; let me invoke a blessing\non FIVE, the perfect number, whereby the Pound Turkish\nis distributed into the American dollar.”",
        "He remained for a few moments with his eyes turned, as\nif in supplication, towards the vaulted ceiling.",
        "“Have you got it?” asked Abdul.",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“And what do we owe, adding it all together?”",
        "“Forty billion dollars,” said Toomuch.",
        "“Isn’t that wonderful!” exclaimed Abdul, with delight\nradiating over his countenance. “Who would have thought\nthat before the war! Forty billion dollars! Aren’t we\nthe financiers! Aren’t we the bulwark of monetary power!\nCan you touch that in Canada?”",
        "“No,” I said, “we can’t. We don’t owe two billion yet.”",
        "“Oh, never mind, never mind,” said the little man in a\nconsoling tone. “You are only a young country yet. You’ll\ndo better later on. And in any case I am sure you are\njust as proud of your one billion as we are of our forty.”",
        "“Oh, yes,” I said, “we certainly are.”",
        "“Come, come, that’s something anyway. You’re on the right\ntrack, and you must not be discouraged if you’re not up\nto the Turkish standard yet. You must remember, as I told\nyou before, that Turkey leads the world in all ideas of\ngovernment and finance. Take the present situation. Here\nwe are, bankrupt–pass me the champagne, Toomuch, and\nsit down with us–the very first nation of the lot. It’s\na great feather in the cap of our financiers. It gives\nus a splendid start for the new era of reconstruction\nthat we are beginning on. As you perhaps have heard we\nare all hugely busy about it. You notice my books and\npapers, do you not?” the Sultan added very proudly, waving\nhis hand towards a great pile of blue books, pamphlets\nand documents that were heaped upon the floor beside him.",
        "“Why! I never knew before that you ever read anything!\"\nI exclaimed in amazement.",
        "“Never did. But everything’s changed now, isn’t it,\nToomuch? I sit and work here for hours every morning.\nIt’s become a delight to me. After all,” said Abdul,\nlighting a big cigar and sticking up his feet on his pile\nof papers with an air of the deepest comfort, “what is\nthere like work? So stimulating, so satisfying. I sit\nhere working away, just like this, most of the day.\nThere’s nothing like it.”",
        "“What are you working at?” I asked.",
        "“Reconstruction,” said the little man, puffing a big\ncloud from his cigar, “reconstruction.”",
        "“What kind of reconstruction?”",
        "“All kinds–financial, industrial, political, social.\nIt’s great stuff. By the way,” he continued with great\nanimation, “would you like to be my Minister of Labour?\nNo? Well, I’m sorry. I half hoped you would. We’re having\nno luck with them. The last one was thrown into the\nBosphorous on Monday. Here’s the report on it–no, that’s\nthe one on the shooting of the Minister of Religion–ah!\nhere it is–Report on the Drowning of the Minister of\nLabour. Let me read you a bit of this: I call this one\nof the best reports, of its kind, that have come in.”",
        "“No, no,” I said, “don’t bother to read it. Just tell me\nwho did it and why.”",
        "“Workingmen,” said the Sultan, very cheerfully, “a\ndelegation. They withheld their reasons.”",
        "“So you are having labour troubles here too?” I asked.",
        "“Labour troubles!” exclaimed the little Sultan rolling\nup his eyes. “I should say so. The whole of Turkey is\nbubbling with labour unrest like the rosewater in a\nnarghile. Look at your tablets, Toomuch, and tell me what\nnew strikes there have been this morning.”",
        "The aged Secretary fumbled with his notes and began to\nmurmur–\"Truly will I try with the aid of Allah–”",
        "“Now, now,” said Abdul, warningly, “that won’t do. Say\nsimply ’Sure.’ Now tell me.”",
        "The Secretary looked at a little list and read: “The\nstrikes of to-day comprise–the wig-makers, the dog\nfanciers, the conjurers, the snake charmers, and the\nsoothsayers.”",
        "“You hear that,” said Abdul proudly. “That represents\nsome of the most skilled labour in Turkey.”",
        "“I suppose it does,” I said, “but tell me Abdul–what\nabout the really necessary trades, the coal miners, the\nsteel workers, the textile operatives, the farmers, and\nthe railway people. Are they working?”",
        "The little Sultan threw himself back on his cushions in\na paroxysm of laughter, in which even his ancient Secretary\nwas feign to join.",
        "“My dear sir, my dear sir!” he laughed, “don’t make me\ndie of laughter. Working! those people working! Surely\nyou don’t think we are so behind hand in Turkey as all\nthat! All those worker’s stopped absolutely months ago.\nIt is doubtful if they’ll ever work again. There’s a\nstrong movement in Turkey to abolish all NECESSARY work\naltogether.”",
        "“But who then,” I asked, “is working?”",
        "“Look on the tablets, Toomuch, and see.”",
        "The aged Secretary bowed, turned over the leaves of his\n“tablets,” which I now perceived on a closer view to be\nmerely an American ten cent memorandum book. Then he\nread:",
        "“The following, O all highest, still work–the beggars,\nthe poets, the missionaries, the Salvation Army, and the\ninstructors of the Youths of Light in the American\nPresbyterian College.”",
        "“But, dear me, Abdul,” I exclaimed, “surely this situation\nis desperate? What can your nation subsist on in such a\nsituation?”",
        "“Pooh, pooh,” said the Sultan. “The interest on our debt\nalone is two billion a year. Everybody in Turkey, great\nor small, holds bonds to some extent. At the worst they\ncan all live fairly well on the interest. This is finance,\nis it not, Toomuch Koffi?”",
        "“The very best and latest,” said the aged man with a\nprofound salaam.",
        "“But what steps are you taking,” I asked, “to remedy your\nlabour troubles?”",
        "“We are appointing commissions,” said Abdul. “We appoint\none for each new labour problem. How many yesterday,\nToomuch?”",
        "“Forty-three,” answered the secretary.",
        "“That’s below our average, is it not?” said Abdul a little\nanxiously. “Try to keep it up to fifty if you can.”",
        "“And these commissions, what do they do?”",
        "“They make Reports,” said Abdul, beginning to yawn as if\nthe continued brain exercise of conversation were fatiguing\nhis intellect, “excellent reports. We have had some that\nare said to be perfect models of the very best Turkish.\"\n “And what do they recommend?”",
        "“I don’t know,” said the Sultan. “We don’t read them for\nthat. We like to read them simply as Turkish.”",
        "“But what,” I urged, “do you do with them? What steps do\nyou take?”",
        "“We send them all,” replied the little man, puffing at\nhis pipe and growing obviously drowsy as he spoke, “to\nWoodrow Wilson. He can deal with them. He is the great\nconciliator of the world. Let him have–how do you say\nit in English, it is a Turkish phrase–let him have his\nstomach full of conciliation.”",
        "Abdul dozed on his cushions for a moment. Then he reopened\nhis eyes. “Is there anything else you want to know,” he\nasked, “before I retire to the Inner Harem?”",
        "“Just one thing,” I said, “if you don’t mind. How do you\nstand internationally? Are you coming into the New League\nof Nations?”",
        "The Sultan shook his head.",
        "“No,” he said, “we’re not coming in. We are starting a\nnew league of our own.”",
        "“And who are in it?”",
        "“Ourselves, and the Armenians–and let me see–the Irish,\nare they not, Toomuch–and the Bulgarians–are there any\nothers, Toomuch?”",
        "“There is talk,” said the Secretary “of the Yugo-Hebrovians\nand the Scaroovians–”",
        "“Who are they?” I asked.",
        "“We don’t know,” said Abdul, testily. “They wrote to us.\nThey seem all right. Haven’t you got a lot of people in\nyour league that you never heard of?”",
        "“I see,” I said, “and what is the scheme that your league\nis formed on?”",
        "“Very simple,” said the Sultan. “Each member of the league\ngives its WORD to all the other members. Then they all\ntake an OATH together. Then they all sign it. That is\nabsolutely binding.”",
        "He rolled back on his cushions in an evident state of\nboredom and weariness.",
        "“But surely,” I protested, “you don’t think that a league\nof that sort can keep the peace?”",
        "“Peace!” exclaimed Abdul waking into sudden astonishment.\n“Peace! I should think NOT! Our league is for WAR. Every\nmember gives its word that at the first convenient\nopportunity it will knock the stuff out of any of the\nothers that it can.”",
        "The little Sultan again subsided. Then he rose, with some\ndifficulty, from his cushions.",
        "“Toomuch,” he said, “take our inquisitive friend out into\nthe town; take him to the Bosphorous; take him to the\nisland where the dogs are; take him anywhere.” He paused\nto whisper a few instructions into the ear of the Secretary.\n“You understand,” he said, “well, take him. As for me,\"–he\ngave a great yawn as he shuffled away, “I am about to\nwithdraw into my Inner Harem. Goodbye. I regret that I\ncannot invite you in.”",
        "“So do I,” I said. “Goodbye.”",
        "IV.–Echoes of the War",
        "1.–The Boy Who Came Back",
        "The war is over. The soldiers are coming home. On all\nsides we are assured that the problem of the returned\nsoldier is the gravest of our national concerns.",
        "So I may say it without fear of contradiction,–since\neverybody else has seen it,–that, up to the present\ntime, the returned soldier is a disappointment. He is\nnot turning out as he ought. According to all the\nprofessors of psychology he was to come back bloodthirsty\nand brutalised, soaked in militarism and talking only of\nslaughter. In fact, a widespread movement had sprung up,\nwarmly supported by the business men of the cities, to\nput him on the land. It was thought that central Nevada\nor northern Idaho would do nicely for him. At the same\ntime an agitation had been started among the farmers,\nwith the slogan “Back to the city,” the idea being that\nfarm life was so rough that it was not fair to ask the\nreturned soldier to share it.",
        "All these anticipations turn out to be quite groundless.",
        "The first returned soldier of whom I had direct knowledge\nwas my nephew Tom. When he came back, after two years in\nthe trenches, we asked him to dine with us. “Now, remember,\"\nI said to my wife, “Tom will be a very different being\nfrom what he was when he went away. He left us as little\nmore than a school boy, only in his first year at college;\nin fact, a mere child. You remember how he used to bore\nus with baseball talk and that sort of thing. And how\nshy he was! You recall his awful fear of Professor Razzler,\nwho used to teach him mathematics. All that, of course,\nwill be changed now. Tom will have come back a man. We\nmust ask the old professor to meet him. It will amuse\nTom to see him again. Just think of the things he must\nhave seen! But we must be a little careful at dinner not\nto let him horrify the other people with brutal details\nof the war.”",
        "Tom came. I had expected him to arrive in uniform with\nhis pocket full of bombs. Instead of this he wore ordinary\nevening dress with a dinner jacket. I realised as I helped\nhim to take off his overcoat in the hall that he was very\nproud of his dinner jacket. He had never had one before.\nHe said he wished the “boys” could see him in it. I asked\nhim why he had put off his lieutenant’s uniform so quickly.\nHe explained that he was entitled not to wear it as soon\nas he had his discharge papers signed; some of the fellows,\nhe said, kicked them off as soon as they left the ship,\nbut the rule was, he told me, that you had to wear the\nthing till your papers were signed.",
        "Then his eye caught a glimpse sideways of Professor\nRazzler standing on the hearth rug in the drawing room.\n“Say,” he said, “is that the professor?” I could see that\nTom was scared. All the signs of physical fear were\nwritten on his face. When I tried to lead him into the\ndrawing room I realised that he was as shy as ever. Three\nof the women began talking to him all at once. Tom\nanswered, yes or no,–with his eyes down. I liked the\nway he stood, though, so unconsciously erect and steady.\nThe other men who came in afterwards, with easy greetings\nand noisy talk, somehow seemed loud-voiced and\nself-assertive.",
        "Tom, to my surprise, refused a cocktail. It seems, as he\nexplained, that he “got into the way of taking nothing\nover there.” I noticed that my friend Quiller, who is a\nwar correspondent, or, I should say, a war editorial\nwriter, took three cocktails and talked all the more\nbrilliantly for it through the opening courses of the\ndinner, about the story of the smashing of the Hindenburg\nline. He decided, after his second Burgundy, that it had\nbeen simply a case of sticking it out. I say “Burgundy\"\nbecause we had substituted Burgundy, the sparkling kind,\nfor champagne at our dinners as one of our little war\neconomies.",
        "Tom had nothing to say about the Hindenburg line. In\nfact, for the first half of the dinner he hardly spoke.\nI think he was worried about his left hand. There is a\ndeep furrow across the back of it where a piece of shrapnel\nwent through and there are two fingers that will hardly\nmove at all. I could see that he was ashamed of its\nclumsiness and afraid that someone might notice it. So\nhe kept silent. Professor Razzler did indeed ask him\nstraight across the table what he thought about the final\nbreaking of the Hindenburg line. But he asked it with\nthat same fierce look from under his bushy eyebrows with\nwhich he used to ask Tom to define the path of a tangent,\nand Tom was rattled at once. He answered something about\nbeing afraid that he was not well posted, owing to there\nbeing so little chance over there to read the papers.",
        "After that Professor Razzler and Mr. Quiller discussed\nfor us, most energetically, the strategy of the Lorraine\nsector (Tom served there six months, but he never said\nso) and high explosives and the possibilities of aerial\nbombs. (Tom was “buried” by an aerial bomb but, of course,\nhe didn’t break in and mention it.)",
        "But we did get him talking of the war at last, towards\nthe end of the dinner; or rather, the girl sitting next\nto him did, and presently the rest of us found ourselves\nlistening. The strange thing was that the girl was a mere\nslip of a thing, hardly as old as Tom himself. In fact,\nmy wife was almost afraid she might be too young to ask\nto dinner: girls of that age, my wife tells me, have\nhardly sense enough to talk to men, and fail to interest\nthem. This is a proposition which I think it better not\nto dispute.",
        "But at any rate we presently realized that Tom was talking\nabout his war experiences and the other talk about the\ntable was gradually hushed into listening.",
        "This, as nearly as I can set it down, is what he told\nus: That the French fellows picked up baseball in a way\nthat is absolutely amazing; they were not much good, it\nseems, at the bat, at any rate not at first, but at\nrunning bases they were perfect marvels; some of the\nFrench made good pitchers, too; Tom knew a poilu who had\nlost his right arm who could pitch as good a ball with\nhis left as any man on the American side; at the port\nwhere Tom first landed and where they trained for a month\nthey had a dandy ball ground, a regular peach, a former\nparade ground of the French barracks. On being asked\nWHICH port it was, Tom said he couldn’t remember; he\nthought it was either Boulogne or Bordeaux or Brest,–at\nany rate, it was one of those places on the English\nchannel. The ball ground they had behind the trenches\nwas not so good; it was too much cut up by long range\nshells. But the ball ground at the base hospital (where\nTom was sent for his second wound) was an A1 ground. The\nFrench doctors, it appears, were perfectly rotten at\nbaseball, not a bit like the soldiers. Tom wonders that\nthey kept them. Tom says that baseball had been tried\namong the German prisoners, but they are perfect dubs.\nHe doubts whether the Germans will ever be able to play\nball. They lack the national spirit. On the other hand,\nTom thinks that the English will play a great game when\nthey really get into it. He had two weeks’ leave in London\nand went to see the game that King George was at, and\nsays that the King, if they will let him, will make the\ngreatest rooter of the whole bunch.",
        "Such was Tom’s war talk.",
        "It grieved me to note that as the men sat smoking their\ncigars and drinking liqueur whiskey (we have cut out port\nat our house till the final peace is signed) Tom seemed\nto have subsided into being only a boy again, a first-year\ncollege boy among his seniors. They spoke to him in quite\na patronising way, and even asked him two or three direct\nquestions about fighting in the trenches, and wounds and\nthe dead men in No Man’s Land and the other horrors that\nthe civilian mind hankers to hear about. Perhaps they\nthought, from the boy’s talk, that he had seen nothing.\nIf so, they were mistaken. For about three minutes, not\nmore, Tom gave them what was coming to them. He told\nthem, for example, why he trained his “fellows” to drive\nthe bayonet through the stomach and not through the head,\nthat the bayonet driven through the face or skull sticks\nand,–but there is no need to recite it here. Any of the\nboys like Tom can tell it all to you, only they don’t\nwant to and don’t care to.",
        "They’ve got past it.",
        "But I noticed that as the boy talked,–quietly and\nreluctantly enough,–the older men fell silent and looked\ninto his face with the realisation that behind his simple\ntalk and quiet manner lay an inward vision of grim and\nawful realities that no words could picture.",
        "I think that they were glad when we joined the ladies\nagain and when Tom talked of the amateur vaudeville show\nthat his company had got up behind the trenches.",
        "Later on, when the other guests were telephoning for\ntheir motors and calling up taxis, Tom said he’d walk to\nhis hotel; it was only a mile and the light rain that\nwas falling would do him, he said, no harm at all. So he\ntrudged off, refusing a lift.",
        "Oh, no, I don’t think we need to worry about the returned\nsoldier. Only let him return, that’s all. When he does,\nhe’s a better man than we are, Gunga Dinn.",
        "2.–The War Sacrifices of Mr. Spugg",
        "Although we had been members of the same club for years,\nI only knew Mr. Spugg by sight until one afternoon when\nI heard him saying that he intended to send his chauffeur\nto the war.",
        "It was said quite quietly,–no bombast or boasting about\nit. Mr. Spugg was standing among a little group of\nlistening members of the club and when he said that he\nhad decided to send his chauffeur, he spoke with a kind\nof simple earnestness, a determination that marks the\ncharacter of the man.",
        "“Yes,” he said, “we need all the man power we can command.\nThis thing has come to a showdown and we’ve got to\nrecognise it. I told Henry that it’s a showdown and that\nhe’s to get ready and start right away.”",
        "“Well, Spugg,” said one of the members “you’re certainly\nsetting us a fine example.”",
        "“What else can a man do?” said Mr. Spugg.",
        "“When does your chauffeur leave?” asked another man.",
        "“Right away. I want him in the firing line just as quick\nas I can get him there.”",
        "“It’s a fine thing you’re doing, Spugg,” said a third\nmember, “but do you realise that your chauffeur may be\nkilled?”",
        "“I must take my chance on that,” answered Mr. Spugg,\nfirmly. “I’ve thought this thing out and made up my mind:\nIf my chauffeur is killed, I mean to pay for him,–full\nand adequate compensation. The loss must fall on me, not\non him. Or, say Henry comes back mutilated,–say he loses\na leg,–say he loses two legs,–”",
        "Here Mr. Spugg looked about him at his listeners, with\na look that meant that even three legs wouldn’t be too\nmuch for him.",
        "“Whatever Henry loses I pay for. The loss shall fall on\nme, every cent of it.”",
        "“Spugg,” said a quiet looking, neatly dressed man whom\nI knew to be the president of an insurance company and\nwho reached out and shook the speaker by the hand, “this\nis a fine thing you’re doing, a big thing. But we mustn’t\nlet you do it alone. Let our company take a hand in it.\nWe’re making a special rate now on chauffeurs, footmen,\nand house-servants sent to the war, quite below the rate\nthat actuarial figures justify. It is our little war\ncontribution,” he added modestly. “We like to feel that\nwe’re doing our bit, too. We had a chauffeur killed last\nweek. We paid for him right off without demur,–waived\nall question of who killed him. I never signed a check\n(as I took occasion to say in a little note I wrote to\nhis people) with greater pleasure.”",
        "“What do you do if Henry’s mutilated?” asked Mr. Spugg,\nturning his quiet eyes on the insurance man and facing\nthe brutal facts of things without flinching. “What do\nyou pay? Suppose I lose the use of Henry’s legs, what\nthen?”",
        "“It’s all right,” said his friend. “Leave it to us.\nWhatever he loses, we make it good.”",
        "“All right,” said Spugg, “send me round a policy. I’m\ngoing to see Henry clear through on this.”",
        "It was at this point that at my own urgent request I was\nintroduced to Mr. Spugg, so that I might add my\ncongratulations to those of the others. I told him that\nI felt, as all the other members of the club did, that\nhe was doing a big thing, and he answered again, in his\nmodest way, that he didn’t see what else a man could do.",
        "“My son Alfred and I,” he said, “talked it over last\nnight and we agreed that we can run the car ourselves,\nor make a shot at it anyway. After all, it’s war time.”",
        "“What branch of the service are you putting your chauffeur\nin?” I asked.",
        "“I’m not sure,” he answered. “I think I’ll send him up\nin the air. It’s dangerous, of course, but it’s no time\nto think about that.”",
        "So, in due time, Mr. Spugg’s chauffeur, Henry, went\noverseas. He was reported first as in England. Next he\nwas right at the front, at the very firing itself. We\nknew then,–everybody in the club knew that Mr. Spugg’s\nchauffeur might be killed at any moment. But great as\nthe strain must have been, Spugg went up and down to his\noffice and in and out of the club without a tremor. The\nsituation gave him a new importance in our eyes, something\ntense.",
        "“This seems to be a terrific business,” I said to him\none day at lunch, “this new German drive.”",
        "“My chauffeur,” said Mr. Spugg, “was right in the middle\nof it.”",
        "“He was, eh?”",
        "“Yes,” he continued, “one shell burst in the air so near\nhim it almost broke his wings.”",
        "Mr. Spugg told this with no false boasting or bravado,\neating his celery as he spoke of it. Here was a man who\nhad nearly had his chauffeur’s wings blown off and yet\nhe never moved a muscle. I began to realize the kind of\nresolute stuff that the man was made of.",
        "A few days later bad news came to the club.",
        "“Have you heard the bad news about Spugg?” someone asked.",
        "“No, what?”",
        "“His chauffeur’s been gassed.”",
        "“How is he taking it?”",
        "“Fine. He’s sending off his gardener to take the chauffeur’s\nplace.”",
        "So that was Mr. Spugg’s answer to the Germans.",
        "We lunched together that day.",
        "“Yes,” he said, “Henry’s gassed. How it happened I don’t\nknow. He must have come down out of the air. I told him\nI wanted him in the air. But let it pass. It’s done now.”",
        "“And you’re sending your gardener?”",
        "“I am,” said Spugg. “He’s gone already. I called him in\nfrom the garden yesterday. I said, ’William, Henry’s been\ngassed. Our first duty is to keep up our man power at\nthe front. You must leave to-night.’”",
        "“What are you putting William into?” I asked",
        "“Infantry. He’ll do best in the trenches,–digs well and\nis a very fair shot. Anyway I want him to see all the\nfighting that’s going. If the Germans want give and take\nin this business they can have it. They’ll soon see who\ncan stand it best. I told William when he left. I said,\n’William, we’ve got to show these fellows that man for\nman we’re a match for them.’ That’s the way I look at\nit, man for man.”",
        "I watched Mr. Spugg’s massive face as he went on with\nhis meal. Not a nerve of it moved. If he felt any fear,\nat least he showed no trace of it.",
        "After that I got war news from him at intervals, in little\nscraps, as I happened to meet him. “The war looks bad,\"\nI said to him one day as I chanced upon him getting into\nhis motor. “This submarine business is pretty serious.”",
        "“It is,” he said, “William was torpedoed yesterday.”",
        "Then he got into his car and drove away, as quietly as\nif nothing had happened.",
        "A little later that day I heard him talking about it in\nthe club. “Yes,” he was saying, “a submarine. It torpedoed\nWilliam,–my gardener. I have both a chauffeur and a\ngardener at the war. William was picked up on a raft.\nHe’s in pretty bad shape. My son Alfred had a cable from\nhim that he’s coming home. We’ve both telegraphed him to\nstick it out.”",
        "The news was the chief topic in the club that day. “Spugg’s\ngardener has been torpedoed,” they said, “but Spugg\nrefuses to have him quit and come home.” “Well done,\nSpugg,” said everybody.",
        "After that we had news from time to time about both\nWilliam and Henry.",
        "“Henry’s out of the hospital,” said Spugg. “I hope to\nhave him back in France in a few days. William’s in bad\nshape still. I had a London surgeon go and look at him.\nI told him not to mind the expense but to get William\nfixed up right away. It seems that one arm is more or\nless paralysed. I’ve wired back to him not to hesitate.\nThey say William’s blood is still too thin for the\noperation. I’ve cabled to them to take some of Henry’s.\nI hate to do it, but this is no time to stick at anything.”",
        "A little later William and Henry were reported both back\nin France. This was at the very moment of the great\noffensive. But Spugg went about his daily business unmoved.\nThen came the worst news of all. “William and Henry,” he\nsaid to me, “are both missing. I don’t know where the\ndevil they are.”",
        "“Missing?” I repeated.",
        "“Both of them. The Germans have caught them both. I\nsuppose I shan’t have either of them back now till the\nwar is all over.”",
        "He gave a slight sigh,–the only sign of complaint that\never I had heard come from him.",
        "But the next day we learned what was Spugg’s answer to\nthe German’s capture of William and Henry.",
        "“Have you heard what Spugg is doing?” the members of the\nclub asked one another.",
        "“What?”",
        "“He’s sending over Meadows, HIS OWN MAN!”",
        "There was no need to comment on it. The cool courage of\nthe thing spoke for itself. Meadows,–Spugg’s own man,–his\nhouse valet, without whom he never travelled twenty miles!",
        "“What else was there to do?” said Mr. Spugg when I asked\nhim if it was true that Meadows was going. “I take no\ncredit for sending Meadows nor, for the matter of that,\nfor anything that Meadows may do over there. It was a\nsimple matter of duty. My son and I had him into the\ndining room last night after dinner. ’Meadows,’ we said,\n’Henry and William are caught. Our man power at the front\nhas got to be kept up. There’s no one left but ourselves\nand you. There’s no way out of it. You’ll have to go.’”",
        "“But how,” I protested, “can you get along with Meadows,\nyour valet, gone? You’ll be lost!”",
        "“We must do the best we can. We’ve talked it all over.\nMy son will help me dress and I will help him. We can\nmanage, no doubt.”",
        "So Meadows went.",
        "After this Mr. Spugg, dressed as best he could manage\nit, and taking turns with his son in driving his own\nmotor, was a pathetic but uncomplaining object.",
        "Meadows meantime was reported as with the heavy artillery,\ndoing well. “I hope nothing happens to Meadows,” Spugg\nkept saying. “If it does, we’re stuck. We can’t go\nourselves. We’re too busy. We’ve talked it over and we’ve\nboth decided that it’s impossible to get away from the\noffice,–not with business as brisk as it is now. We’re\nbusier than we’ve been in ten years and can’t get off\nfor a day. We may try to take a month off for the\nAdirondacks a little later but as for Europe, it’s out\nof the question.”",
        "Meantime, one little bit of consolation came to help Mr.\nSpugg to bear the burden of the war. I found him in the\nlounge room of the club one afternoon among a group of\nmen, exhibiting two medals that were being passed from\nhand to hand.",
        "“Sent to me by the French government,” he explained\nproudly. “They’re for William and Henry. The motto means,\n’For Conspicuous Courage\"’ (Mr. Spugg drew himself up\nwith legitimate pride). “I shall keep one and let Alfred\nkeep the other till they come back.” Then he added, as\nan afterthought, “They may never come back.”",
        "From that day on, Mr. Spugg, with his French medal on\nhis watch chain, was the most conspicuous figure in the\nclub. He was pointed out as having done more than any\nother one man in the institution to keep the flag flying.\nBut presently the limit of Mr. Spugg’s efforts and\nsacrifices was reached. Even patriotism such as his must\nhave some bounds.",
        "On entering the club one afternoon I could hear his voice\nbawling vociferously in one of the telephone cabinets in\nthe hall. “Hello, Washington,” he was shouting. “Is that\nWashington? Long Distance, I want Washington.”",
        "Fifteen minutes later he came up to the sitting room,\nstill flushed with indignation and excitement. “That’s\nthe limit,” he said, “the absolute limit!”",
        "“What’s the matter?” I asked.",
        "“They drafted my son Alfred,” he answered.",
        "“Just imagine it! When we’re so busy in the office that\nwe’re getting down there at half past eight in the morning!\nDrafted Alfred! ’Great Caesar’ I said to them! ’Look\nhere! You’ve had my chauffeur and he’s gassed, and you’ve\nhad my gardener and he’s torpedoed and they’re both\nprisoners, and last month I sent you my own man! That,’\nI said, ’is about the limit.’”",
        "“What did they say,” I asked.",
        "“Oh, it’s all right. They’ve fixed it all up and they’ve\napologized as well. Alfred won’t go, of course, but it\nmakes one realise that you can carry a thing too far.\nWhy, they’d be taking me next!”",
        "“Oh, surely not!” I said.",

But let\nus set beside it a picture such as this, taken from the\nNew York Imperial Gazette of 1925–or from any paper of\nthe same period, such as would have been published if\nGermany had won.",

The\nboy was christened yesterday at the (Imperial) Lutheran\nChurch and is to bear the name Frederick Wilhelm Amelia\nMary Johan Heinrich Ruprecht. The whole city of Albany\nis thrown into the wildest rejoicing. The legislature\nhas voted an addition of $400,000 per annum to the civil\nlist for the maintenance of the young prince. Joy suffuses\nevery home. This being the tenth son born to their\nHighnesses in ten years it is felt that the future of\nthe dynasty is more or less secured. Even the humblest\nhome is filled with the reflected joy that streams out\nfrom the Residency.

The paintings which the\nPrincess has been preciously pleased to paint and has even\nstooped to exhibit to the filled-with-wonder eye of the\npublic have been immediately awarded the first prize in\neach class. While it would be invidious even to suggest that\nany one of Her High Incipiency’s pictures is better than any\nother, our feeling is that especially the picture Night on\nthe Hudson River is of so rare a quality both of technique\nand of inspiration that it supersedes the bounds of the\nhitherto-thought-to-be-possible art in America. The\nPrincess’s conception of night, black as a pall and yet\nluminous as a polished stove pipe, is only equalled by\nher feeling towards the Hudson which lies extended in\nsoporific superficiality beneath the sable covering of\ndarkness in which Her Highness has been pleased to\noverwhelm it.

The marriage, so it is\nwhispered, although performed in accordance with the\nwishes of the Emperor as expressed by cable, is in every\nway a love match. What lends a touch of romance to the\nbetrothal of the Royal Younglings is that the Prince had\nnever even seen the Princess Amelia until the day when\nthe legislature of the Provinz of Maine voted her a\nmarriage portion of half a million dollars. Immediately\non this news a secret visit was arranged, the Prince\njourneying to Bangor incognito as the Count of Flim-Flam\nin the costume of an officer of the Imperial Scavengers.\nOn receipt of the Emperor’s telegram the happy pair fell\nin love with one another at once. What makes the approaching\nunion particularly auspicious for the whole country is\nthat it brings with it the union of Maine and Texas,\nhenceforth to form a single grateful provinz.

        "The Great Peace Kermesse at the Galaxy Club, to which I\nhave the honour to belong, held with a view to wipe out\nthe Peace Deficit of the Club, has just ended. For three\nweeks our club house has been a blaze of illumination.\nWe have had four orchestras in attendance. There have\nbeen suppers and dances every night. Our members have\nnot spared themselves.",
        "The Kermesse is now over. We have time, as our lady\nmembers are saying, to turn round.",
        "For the moment we are sitting listening, amid bursts of\napplause, to our treasurer’s statement. As we hear it we\nrealise that this Peace Kermesse has proved the culmination\nand crown of four winters’ war work.",
        "But I must explain from the beginning.",
        "Our efforts began with the very opening of the war. We\nfelt that a rich organisation like ours ought to do\nsomething for the relief of the Belgians. At the same\ntime we felt that our members would rather receive\nsomething in the way of entertainment for their money\nthan give it straight out of their pockets.",
        "We therefore decided first to hold a public lecture in\nthe club, and engaged the services of Professor Dry to\nlecture on the causes of the war.",
        "In view of the circumstances, Professor Dry very kindly\nreduced his lecture fee, which (he assured us) is generally\ntwo hundred and fifty dollars, to two hundred and forty.",
        "The lecture was most interesting. Professor Dry traced\nthe causes of the War backwards through the Middle Ages.\nHe showed that it represented the conflict of the\nbrachiocephalic culture of the Wendic races with the\ndolichocephalic culture of the Alpine stock. At the time\nwhen the lights went out he had got it back to the eighth\ncentury before Christ.",
        "Unfortunately the night, being extremely wet, was\nunfavourable. Few of our members care to turn out to\nlectures in wet weather. The treasurer was compelled to\nannounce to the Committee a net deficit of two hundred\ndollars. Some of the ladies of the Committee moved that\nthe entire deficit be sent to the Belgians, but were\noverruled by the interference of the men.",
        "But the error was seen to have been in the choice of the\nlecturer. Our members were no longer interested in the\ncauses of the war. The topic was too old. We therefore\nheld another public lecture in the club, on the topic\nWhat Will Come After the War. It was given by a very\ntalented gentleman, a Mr. Guess, a most interesting\nspeaker, who reduced his fee (as the thing was a war\ncharity) by one-half, leaving it at three hundred dollars.\nUnhappily the weather was against us. It was too fine.\nOur members scarcely care to listen to lectures in fine\nweather. And it turned out that our members are not\ninterested in what will come after the war. The topic is\ntoo new. Our receipts of fifty dollars left us with a\nnet deficit of two hundred and fifty. Our treasurer\ntherefore proposed that we should carry both deficits\nforward and open a Special Patriotic Entertainment Account\nshowing a net total deficit of four hundred and fifty\ndollars.",
        "In the opinion of the committee our mistake had been in\nengaging outside talent. It was felt that the cost of\nthis was prohibitive. It was better to invite the services\nof the members of the club themselves. A great number of\nthe ladies expressed their willingness to take part in\nany kind of war work that took the form of public\nentertainment.",
        "Accordingly we presented a play. It was given in the ball\nroom of the club house, a stage being specially put up\nfor us by a firm of contractors. The firm (as a matter\nof patriotism) did the whole thing for us at cost, merely\ncharging us with the labour, the material, the time, the\nthought and the anxiety that they gave to the job, but\nfor nothing else. In fact, the whole staging, including\nlights, plumbing and decorations was merely a matter of\nfive hundred dollars. The plumbers very considerately\nmade no charge for their time, but only for their work.",
        "It was felt that it would be better to have a new play\nthan an old. We selected a brilliant little modern\ndrawing-room comedy never yet presented. The owner of\nthe copyright, a theatrical firm, let us use it for a\nmerely nominal fee of two hundred dollars, including the\nsole right to play the piece forever. There being only\ntwenty-eight characters in it, it was felt to be more\nsuitable than a more ambitious thing. The tickets were\nplaced at one dollar, no one being admitted free except\nthe performers themselves, and the members who very kindly\nacted as scene shifters, curtain lifters, ushers, door-keepers,\nprogramme sellers, and the general committee of management.\nAll the performers, at their own suggestion, supplied their\nown costumes, charging nothing to the club except the material\nand the cost of dressmaking. Beyond this there was no expense\nexcept for the fee, very reasonable, of Mr. Skip, the\nprofessional coach who trained the performers, and who asked\nus, in view of the circumstances, less than half of what he\nwould have been willing to accept.",
        "The proceeds were to be divided between the Belgian Fund\nand the Red Cross, giving fifty per cent to each. A motion\nin amendment from the ladies’ financial committee to give\nfifty per cent to the Belgian Fund and sixty per cent to\nthe Red Cross was voted down.",
        "Unfortunately it turned out that the idea of a PLAY was\na mistake in judgment. Our members, it seemed, did not\ncare to go to see a play except in a theatre. A great\nnumber of them, however, very kindly turned out to help\nin shifting the scenery and in acting as ushers.",
        "Our treasurer announced, as the result of the play, a\nnet deficit of twelve hundred dollars. He moved, with\ngeneral applause, that it be carried forward.",
        "The total deficit having now reached over sixteen hundred\ndollars, there was a general feeling that a very special\neffort must be made to remove it. It was decided to hold\nWeekly Patriotic Dances in the club ball room, every\nSaturday evening. No charge was made for admission to\nthe dances, but a War Supper was served at one dollar a\nhead.",
        "Unfortunately the dances, as first planned, proved again\nan error. It appeared that though our members are\npassionately fond of dancing, few if any of them cared\nto eat at night. The plan was therefore changed. The\nsupper was served first, and was free, and for the dancing\nafter supper a charge was made of one dollar, per person.\nThis again was an error. It seems that after our members\nhave had supper they prefer to go home and sleep. After\none winter of dancing the treasurer announced a total\nPatriotic Relief Deficit of five thousand dollars, to be\ncarried forward to next year. This sum duly appeared in\nthe annual balance sheet of the club. The members,\nespecially the ladies, were glad to think that we were\nat least doing SOMETHING for the war.",
        "At this point some of our larger men, themselves financial\nexperts, took hold. They said that our entertainments\nhad been on too small a scale. They told us that we had\nbeen “undermined by overhead expenses.” The word “overhead\"\nwas soon on everybody’s lips. We were told that if we\ncould “distribute our overhead” it would disappear. It\nwas therefore planned to hold a great War Kermesse with\na view to spreading out the overhead so thin that it\nwould vanish.",
        "But it was at this very moment that the Armistice burst\nupon us in a perfectly unexpected fashion. Everyone of\nour members was, undoubtedly, delighted that the war was\nover but there was a very general feeling that it would\nhave been better if we could have had a rather longer\nnotice of what was coming. It seemed, as many of our\nmembers said, such a leap in the dark to rush into peace\nall at once. It was said indeed by our best business men\nthat in financial circles they had been fully aware that\nthere was a danger of peace for some time and had taken\nsteps to discount the peace risk.",
        "But for the club itself the thing came with a perfect\ncrash. The whole preparation of the great Kermesse was\nwell under way when the news broke upon us. For a time\nthe members were aghast. It looked like ruin. But presently\nit was suggested that it might still be possible to save\nthe club by turning the whole affair into a Peace Kermesse\nand devoting the proceeds to some suitable form of relief.\nLuckily it was discovered that there was still a lot of\nstarvation in Russia, and fortunately it turned out that\nin spite of the armistice the Turks were still killing\nthe Armenians.",
        "So it was decided to hold the Kermesse and give all the\nprofits realised by it to the Victims of the Peace.\nEverybody set to work again with a will. The Kermesse\nindeed had to be postponed for a few months to make room\nfor the changes needed, but it has now been held and, in\na certain sense, it has been the wildest kind of success.\nThe club, as I said, has been a blaze of light for three\nweeks. We have had four orchestras in attendance every\nevening. There have been booths draped with the flags of\nall the Allies, except some that we were not sure about,\nin every corridor of the club. There have been dinner\nparties and dances every evening. The members, especially\nthe ladies, have not spared themselves. Many of them have\nspent practically all their time at the Kermesse, not\ngetting home until two in the morning.",
        "And yet somehow one has felt that underneath the surface\nit was not a success. The spirit seemed gone out of it.\nThe members themselves confessed in confidence that in\nspite of all they could do their hearts were not in it.\nPeace had somehow taken away all the old glad sense of\nenjoyment. As to spending money at the Kermesse all the\nmembers admitted frankly that they had no heart for it.\nThis was especially the case when the rumour got abroad\nthat the Armenians were a poor lot and that some of the\nTurks were quite gentlemanly fellows. It was said, too,\nthat if the Russians did starve it would do them a lot\nof good.",
        "So it was known even before we went to hear the financial\nreport that there would be no question of profits on the\nKermesse going to the Armenians or the Russians.",
        "And to-night the treasurer has been reading out to a\ngeneral meeting the financial results as nearly as they\ncan be computed.",
        "He has put the Net Patriotic Deficit, as nearly as he\ncan estimate it, at fifteen thousand dollars, though he\nhas stated, with applause from the ladies, that the Gross\nDeficit is bigger still.",
        "The Ladies Financial Committee has just carried a motion\nthat the whole of the deficit, both net and gross, be\nnow forwarded to the Red Cross Society (sixty per cent),\nthe Belgian Relief Fund (fifty per cent), and the remainder\ninvested in the War Loan.",
        "But there is a very general feeling among the male members\nthat the club will have to go into liquidation. Peace\nhas ruined us. Not a single member, so far as I am aware,\nis prepared to protest against the peace, or is anything\nbut delighted to think that the war is over. At the same\ntime we do feel that if we could have had a longer notice,\nsix months for instance, we could have braced ourselves\nbetter to stand up against it and meet the blow when it\nfell.",
        "I think, too, that our feeling is shared outside.",

Our attitude\nis that the well dressed man (a little fuller in the\nchest? Yes, a little fuller in the chest, please, Mr.\nJephson) is better able to serve his country than the\nman who goes about in an old suit. The motto of our trade\nis Thrift with Taste.

Our\nfeeling is that a gentleman wearing one of our thrift\nworsteds under one of our Win-the-War light overcoats\n(Mr. Jephson, please show that new Win-the-War overcoating)\nis really helping to keep things going.

As I see it, the income tax is the greatest\nmistake the government ever made. It hits the wrong man.\nIt falls on the man with an income and lets the other\nman escape. The way I look at it, and the way all the\nmen that will be behind you look at it, is that if a man\nsticks tight to it and goes on earning all the income he\ncan, he’s doing his bit, in his own way, to win the war.\nAll we ask is to be let alone (don’t put that in your\nnotes as from me, but you can say it), let us alone to\ngo on quietly piling up income till we get the Germans\nlicked.

They say them fellers over in France\nhas to shave every morning by military order: if they\ndidn’t the Germans would have ’em beat. I say the barber\nis doing his bit as much as any man. I was to Washington\nfour months last winter, and I done all the work of three\nsenators and two congressmen (will I clip that neck?)\nand I done the work of a United States Admiral every\nSaturday night.

        "“There is no doubt,” said Mr. Taft recently, “that the\nwar is destined to effect the most profound uplift and\nchanges, not only in our political outlook, but upon our\nculture, our thought and, most of all, upon our literature.”",
        "I am not absolutely certain that Mr. Taft really said\nthis. He may not have said “uplift.” But I seem to have\nheard something about uplift, somewhere. At any rate,\nthere is no doubt of the fact that our literature has\nmoved–up or down. Yes, the war is not only destined to\naffect our literature, but it has already done so. The\nchange in outlook, in literary style, in mode of expression,\neven in the words themselves is already here.",
        "Anybody can see it for himself by turning over the pages\nof our fashionable novels or by looking at the columns\nof our great American and English newspapers and\nperiodicals.",
        "But stop,–let me show what I mean by examples. I have\nthem here in front of me. Take, for example, the London\nSpectator. Everybody recognised in it a model of literary\ndignity and decorum. Even those who read it least, admitted\nthis most willingly; in fact, perhaps all the more so.\nIn its pages to-day one finds an equal dignity of thought,\nyet, somehow, the wording seems to have undergone an\nalteration. One cannot say just where the change comes\nin. It is what the French call a je ne sais quoi, a\nsomething insaisissable, a sort of nuance, not amounting\nof course to a lueur, but still,–how shall one put\nit,–SOMETHING.",

It is credibly reported by our correspondent at\nThe Hague that the German Emperor, the Crown Prince and\na number of other guys were eye witnesses of the fight.\nIf so, they got the surprise of their young lives. While\nwe should not wish to show anything less than the chivalrous\nconsideration for a beaten enemy which has been a tradition\nof our nation, we feel it is but just to say that for\nonce the dirty pups got what was coming to them. We are\nglad to learn from official quarters that His Majesty\nKing George has been graciously pleased to telegraph to\nGeneral Pershing, ’Soak it to ’em–and THEN some.’",
        "“Meantime the situation from the point of view both of\nterrain and of tactics remains altogether in our favour.\nThe deep salient driven into the German lines near Soissons\nthreatens to break up their communications and force a\nwithdrawal on a wide front. We cannot make the position\nclearer to our English readers than by saying that our\nnew lines occupy, as it were, the form of a baseball\ndiamond, with Soissons at second base and with our\nheadquarters at the home plate and our artillery support\nat third. Our readers will at once grasp the fact that,\nwith our advance pivoted on the pitcher’s box and with\nadequate cover at short, the thing is a lead-pipe cinch,\n–in fact, we have them lashed to the mast.",
        "“Meantime the mood of the hour should be one, not of\nundue confidence or boastfulness, but of quiet resolution\nand deep thankfulness. As the Archbishop of Canterbury\nso feelingly put it in his sermon in Westminster Abbey\nlast Sunday, ’Now that we have them by the neck let us\ngo on, in deep and steadfast purpose, till we have twisted\nthe gizzard out of them.’",
        "“The Archbishop’s noble words should, and will, re-echo\nin every English home.”",
        "Critical people may be inclined to doubt the propriety,\nor even the propinquity, of some of the literary changes\ndue to the war. But there can be no doubt of the excellent\neffect of one of them, namely, the increasing knowledge\nand use among us of the pleasant language of France. It\nis no exaggeration to say that, before the war, few people\nin the United States, even among the colored population,\nspoke French with ease. In fact, in some cases the\ndiscomfort was so obvious as to be almost painful. This\nis now entirely altered. Thanks to our military guide-books,\nand to the general feeling of the day, our citizens are\nsetting themselves to acquire the language of our gallant\nally. And the signs are that they will do it. One hears\nevery day in metropolitan society such remarks as, “Have\nyou read, ’Soo le foo?’” “Oh, you mean that book by\nHaingri Barbooze? No, I have not read it yet, but I have\nread ’Mong Swassant Quinz’ you know, by that other man.”",

Her\nyounger brother he had camouflaged with the present of\na new fishing rod, thus inducing him to retire to the\nriver. The communications with the servants had been cut.\nOf the strict neutrality of the gardener he was already\nassured. Edwin felt that the moment had come for going\nover the top.

That,\nin fact, was the wonderful art of Longfellow–the sense\nbeing independent of the words.",
        "The Platform Introduction",
        "Here is a form of introduction cruelly familiar to those\nwho know it. It is used by the sour-looking villain\nfacetiously called in newspaper reports the “genial\nchairman” of the meeting.

His achievements in” (here the chairman\nlooks at his card again, studies it, turns it upside down\nand adds) “in many directions are familiar to all of\nyou.” There is a feeble attempt at applause and the\nchairman then lifts his hand and says in a plain\nbusiness-like tone–\"Will those of the audience who are\nleaving kindly step as lightly as possible.” He is about\nto sit down, but then adds as a pleasant afterthought\nfor the speaker to brood over–\"I may say, while I am on\nmy feet, that next week our society is to have a REAL\ntreat in hearing–et cetera and so forth–”",
        "After the ceremony of introduction is completed the next\nthing to consider is the proper way to open a conversation.\nThe beginning of conversation is really the hardest part.\nIt is the social equivalent to “going over the top.” It\nmay best be studied in the setting and surroundings of\nthe Evening Reception, where people stand upright and\nagonise, balancing a dish of ice-cream. Here conversation\nreaches its highest pitch of social importance. One must\ntalk or die. Something may be done to stave it off a\nlittle by vigorous eating. But the food at such affairs\nis limited.

Nor are\nthe mere words alone to be considered. In the art of\nconversation much depends upon manner. The true\nconversationalist must, in opening, invest himself with\nan atmosphere of interest and solicitude. He must, as we\nsay in French, be prepared to payer les rais de la\nconversation.

        "The surly one is, let us say, a middle-aged, thick-set\nman of the type that anybody recognizes under the name\nMoney Hog.

        "“Shoe-making machinery,” goes on the willowy lady (she\nreally knows nothing and cares less about it) “must be\nabsolutely fascinating, is it not?”",

Into his little piggy eyes has come a fear that\nthe lady is going to ask him to subscribe to something,\nor wants a block of his common stock, or his name on a\nboard of directors. So he leaves her. Yet if he had known\nit she is probably as rich as he is, or richer, and hasn’t\nthe faintest interest in his factories, and never intends\nto go near one.

        "2.–Heroes and Heroines",
        "“What are you reading?” I asked the other day of a blue-eyed\nboy of ten curled up among the sofa cushions.",
        "He held out the book for me to see.",
        "“Dauntless Ned among the Cannibals,” he answered.",
        "“Is it exciting?” I enquired.",
        "“Not very,” said the child in a matter-of-fact tone. “But\nit’s not bad.”",
        "I took the book from him and read aloud at the opened page.",
        "“In a compact mass the gigantic savages rushed upon our\nhero, shrieking with rage and brandishing their huge\nclubs. Ned stood his ground fearlessly, his back to a\nbanana tree. With a sweep of his cutlass he severed the\nhead of the leading savage from his body, while with a\nback stroke of his dirk he stabbed another to the heart.\nBut resistance against such odds was vain. By sheer weight\nof numbers, Ned was borne to the ground. His arms were\nthen pinioned with stout ropes made of the fibres of the\nboobooda tree. With shrieks of exultation the savages\ndragged our hero to an opening in the woods where a huge\nfire was burning, over which was suspended an enormous\ncaldron of bubbling oil. ’Boil him, boil him,’ yelled\nthe savages, now wrought to the point of frenzy.”",
        "“That seems fairly exciting, isn’t it?” I said.",
        "“Oh, he won’t get boiled,” said the little boy. “He’s\nthe hero.”",
        "So I knew that the child has already taken his first\nsteps in the disillusionment of fiction.",
        "Of course he was quite right as to Ned. This wonderful\nyouth, the hero with whom we all begin an acquaintance\nwith books, passes unhurt through a thousand perils.\nCannibals, Apache Indians, war, battles, shipwrecks,\nleave him quite unscathed. At the most Ned gets a flesh\nwound which is healed, in exactly one paragraph, by that\nwonderful drug called a “simple.”",
        "But the most amazing thing about this particular hero,\nthe boy Ned, is the way in which he turns up in all the\ngreat battles and leading events of the world.",
        "It was Ned, for example, who at the critical moment at\nGettysburg turned in his saddle to General Meade and said\nquietly, “General, the day is ours.” “If it is,” answered\nMeade, as he folded his field glass, “you alone, Ned,\nhave saved it.”",
        "In the same way Ned was present at the crossing of the\nDelaware with Washington. Thus:–",
        "“’What do you see, Ned?’ said Washington, as they peered\nfrom the leading boat into the driving snow.",
        "“’Ice,’ said Ned. ’My boy,’ said the Great American\nGeneral, and a tear froze upon his face as he spoke, ’you\nhave saved us all.’”",
        "Here is Ned at Runningmede when King John with his pen\nin hand was about to sign the Magna Carta.",
        "“For a moment the King paused irresolute, the uplifted\nquill in his hand, while his crafty, furtive eyes indicated\nthat he might yet break his plighted faith with the\nassembled barons.",
        "“Ned laid his mailed hand upon the parchment.",
        "“’Sign it,’ he said sternly, ’or take the consequences.’",
        "“The King signed.",
        "“’Ned,’ said the Baron de Bohun, as he removed his iron\nvizor from his bronze face, ’thou hast this day saved\nall England.’”",
        "In the stories of our boyhood in which Ned figured, there\nwas no such thing as a heroine, or practically none. At\nbest she was brought in as an afterthought. It was\nannounced on page three hundred and one that at the close\nof Ned’s desperate adventures in the West Indies he\nmarried the beautiful daughter of Don Diego, the Spanish\ngovernor of Portobello; or else, at the end of the great\nwar with Napoleon, that he married a beautiful and\naccomplished French girl whose parents had perished in\nthe Revolution.",
        "Ned generally married away from home. In fact his marriages\nwere intended to cement the nations, torn asunder by\nNed’s military career. But sometimes he returned to his\nnative town, all sunburned, scarred and bronzed from\nbattle (the bronzing effect of being in battle is always\nnoted): he had changed from a boy to a man: that is, from\na boy of fifteen to a man of sixteen. In such a case Ned\nmarries in his own home town. It is done after this\nfashion:",
        "“But who is this who advances smiling to greet him as he\ncrosses the familiar threshold of the dear old house?\nCan this tall, beautiful girl be Gwendoline, the\nchild-playmate of his boyhood?”",
        "Well, can it? I ask it of every experienced reader–can\nit or can it not?",
        "Ned had his day, in the boyhood of each of us. We presently\npassed him by. I am speaking, of course, of those of us\nwho are of maturer years and can look back upon thirty\nor forty years of fiction reading. “Ned,” flourishes\nstill, I understand, among the children of today. But\nnow he flies in aeroplanes, and dives in submarines, and\ngives his invaluable military advice to General Joffre\nand General Pershing.",
        "But with the oncoming of adolescent years something softer\nwas needed than Ned with his howling cannibals and his\nfusillade of revolver shots.",
        "So the “Ned” of the Adventure Books was supplanted by\nthe Romantic Heroine of the Victorian Age and the\nLong-winded Immaculate who accompanied her as the Hero.",
        "I do not know when these two first opened their twin\ncareer. Whether Fenimore Cooper or Walter Scott began\nthem, I cannot say. But they had an undisputed run on\ntwo continents for half a century.",
        "This Heroine was a sylph. Her chiefest charm lay in her\nphysical feebleness. She was generally presented to us\nin some such words as these:",
        "“Let us now introduce to our readers the fair Madeline\nof Rokewood. Slender and graceful and of a form so fragile\nthat her frame scarce fitted to fulfil its bodily\nfunctions...she appeared rather as one of those ethereal\nbeings of the air who might visit for a brief moment this\nterrestrial scene, than one of its earthly inhabitants.\nHer large, wondering eyes looked upon the beholder in\nchildlike innocence.”",
        "Sounds simple, doesn’t it? One might suspect there was\nsomething wrong with the girl’s brain. But listen to\nthis:–",
        "“The mind of Madeline, elegantly formed by the devoted\nlabours of the venerable Abbe, her tutor, was of a degree\nof culture rarely found in one so young. Though scarce\neighteen summers had flown over her head at the time when\nwe introduce her to our readers, she was intimately\nconversant with the French, Italian, Spanish, and Provencal\ntongues. The abundant pages of history, both ancient and\nmodern, sacred and profane, had been opened for her by\nher devoted instructor. In music she played with exquisite\ngrace and accuracy upon both the spinet and the harpsichord,\nwhile her voice, though lacking something in compass,\nwas sweet and melodious to a degree.”",
        "From such a list of accomplishments it is clear that\nMadeline could have matriculated, even at the Harvard\nLaw School, with five minutes preparation. Is it any\nwonder that there was a wild rush for Madeline? In fact,\nright after the opening description of the Heroine, there\nfollows an ominous sentence such as this:–",
        "“It was this exquisite being whose person Lord Rip de\nViperous, a man whose reputation had shamed even the most\nlicentious court of the age, and had led to his banishment\nfrom the presence of the king, had sworn to get within\nhis power.”",
        "Personally I don’t blame Lord Rip a particle; it must\nhave been very rough on him to have been banished from\nthe presence of the king–enough to inflame a man to do\nanything.",
        "With two such characters in the story, the scene was set\nand the plot and adventures followed as a matter of\ncourse. Lord Rip de Viperous pursued the Heroine. But at\nevery step he is frustrated. He decoys Madeline to a\nruined tower at midnight, her innocence being such and\nthe gaps left in her education by the Abbe being so wide,\nthat she is unaware of the danger of ruined towers after\nten thirty P.M. In fact, “tempted by the exquisite clarity\nand fulness of the moon, which magnificent orb at this\nseason spread its widest effulgence over all nature, she\naccepts the invitation of her would-be-betrayer to gather\nupon the battlements of the ruined keep the strawberries\nwhich grew there in wild profusion.”",
        "But at the critical moment, Lord de Viperous is balked.\nAt the very instant when he is about to seize her in his\narms, Madeline turns upon him and says in such icy tones,\n“Titled villain that you are, unhand me,” that the man\nis “cowed.” He slinks down the ruined stairway “cowed.\"\nAnd at every later turn, at each renewed attempt, Madeline\n“cows” him in like fashion.",
        "Moreover while Lord de Viperous is being thus cowed by\nMadeline the Heroine, he is also being “dogged” by the\nHero. This counterpart of Madeline who shared her popularity\nfor fifty years can best be described as the Long-winded\nImmaculate Hero. Entirely blameless in his morals, and\nutterly virtuous in his conduct, he possessed at least\none means of defending himself. He could make speeches.\nThis he did on all occasions. With these speeches he\n“dogged” Lord de Viperous. Here is the style of them:–",
        "“’My Lord,’ said Markham...” (incidentally let it be\nexplained that this particular brand of hero was always\nknown by his surname and his surname was always Markham)\n–\"’My lord, the sentiments that you express and the\ndemeanour which you have evinced are so greatly at variance\nwith the title that you bear and the lineage of which\nyou spring that no authority that you can exercise and\nno threats that you are able to command shall deter me\nfrom expressing that for which, however poor and inadequate\nmy powers of speech, all these of whom and for what I am\nwhat I am, shall answer to it for the integrity of that,\nwhich, whether or not, is at least as it is. My lord, I\nhave done. Or shall I speak more plainly still?’”",
        "Is it to be wondered that after this harangue Lord Rip\nsank into a chair, a hideous convulsion upon his face,\nmurmuring–\"It is enough.”",
        "But successful as they were as Hero and Heroine, Markham\nand Madeline presently passed off the scene. Where they\nwent to, I do not know. Perhaps Markham got elected in\nthe legislature of Massachusetts. At any rate they\ndisappeared from fiction.",
        "There followed in place of Madeline, the athletic sunburned\nheroine with the tennis racket. She was generally called\nKate Middleton, or some such plain, straightforward\ndesignation. She wore strong walking boots and leather\nleggings. She ate beef steak. She shot with a rifle. For\na while this Boots and Beef Heroine (of the middle\nnineties) made a tremendous hit. She climbed crags in\nthe Rockies. She threw steers in Colorado with a lariat.\nShe came out strong in sea scenes and shipwrecks, and on\nsinking steamers, where she “cowed” the trembling stewards\nand “dogged” the mutinous sailors in the same fashion\nthat Madeline used to “cow” and “dog” Lord Rip de Viperous.",
        "With the Boots and Beef Heroine went as her running mate\nthe out-of-doors man, whose face had been tanned and\nwhose muscles had been hardened into tempered steel in\nwild rides over the Pampas of Patagonia, and who had\nlearned every art and craft of savage life by living\namong the wild Hoodoos of the Himalayas. This\nAir-and-Grass-man, as he may be called, is generally\nsupposed to write the story... He was “I” all through.\nAnd he had an irritating modesty in speaking of his own\nprowess. Instead of saying straight out that he was the\nstrongest and bravest man in the world, he implied it\nindirectly on every page.",
        "Here, for example, is a typical scene in which “I” and\nKate figure in a desperate adventure in the Rocky Mountains,\npursued by Indians.",
        "“We are about to descend on a single cord from the summit\nof a lofty crag, our sole chance of escape (and a\nfrightfully small chance at that) from the roving band\nof Apaches.",
        "“With my eye I measured the fearsome descent below us.",
        "“’Hold fast to the line, Miss Middleton,’ I said as I\nset my foot against a projecting rock. (Please note that\nthe Air-and-Grass Hero in these stories always calls the\nHeroine Miss Middleton right up to the very end.)",
        "“The noble girl seized the knotted end of the buckskin\nline. ’All right, Mr. Smith,’ she said with quiet\nconfidence.",
        "“I braced myself for the effort. My muscles like tempered\nsteel responded to the strain. I lowered a hundred fathoms\nof the line. I could already hear the voice of Kate far\ndown the cliff.",
        "“Don’t let go the line, Miss Middleton,’ I called. (Here\nwas an excellent piece of advice.)",
        "“The girl’s clear voice floated up to me... ’All right,\nMr. Smith,’ she called, ’I won’t.’”",
        "Of course they landed safely at the foot of the cliff,\nafter the manner of all heroes and heroines. And here\nit is that Kate in her turn comes out strong, at the\nevening encampment, frying bacon over a blazing fire of\npine branches, while the firelight illuminates her leather\nleggings and her rough but picturesque costume.",
        "The circumstances might seem a little daring and improper.\nBut the reader knows that it is all right, because the\nhero and heroine always call one another Miss Middleton\nand Mr. Smith.",
        "Not till right at the end, when they are just getting\nback again to the confines of civilization, do they depart\nfrom this.",
        "Here is the scene that happens... The hero and heroine\nare on the platform of the way-side depot where they are\nto part... Kate to return to the luxurious home of her\naunt, Mrs. van der Kyper of New York, and the Air-and-Grass\nMan to start for the pampas of Patagonia to hunt the\nhoopoo. The Air-and-Grass Man is about to say goodbye.\nThen... “’Kate,’ I said, as I held the noble girl’s gloved\nhand in mine a moment. She looked me in the face with\nthe full, frank, fearless gaze of a sister.",
        "“’Yes?’ she answered.",
        "“’Kate,’ I repeated, ’do you know what I was thinking of\nwhen I held the line while you were half way down the\ncliff?’",
        "“’No,’ she murmured, while a flush suffused her cheek.",
        "“’I was thinking, Kate,’ I said, ’that if the rope broke\nI should be very sorry.’",
        "“’Edward!’ she exclaimed.",
        "“I clasped her in my arms.",
        "“’Shall I make a confession,’ said Kate, looking up\ntimidly, half an hour later, as I tenderly unclasped the\nnoble girl from my encircling arms, ...’I was thinking\nthe same thing too.’”",
        "So Kate and Edward had their day and then, as Tennyson\nsays, they “passed,” or as less cultivated people put\nit, “they were passed up in the air.”",
        "As the years went by they failed to please. Kate was a\ngreat improvement upon Madeline. But she wouldn’t do.\nThe truth was, if one may state it openly, Kate wasn’t\nTOUGH enough. In fact she wasn’t tough at all. She turned\nout to be in reality just as proper and just as virtuous\nas Madeline.",
        "So, too, with the Air-and-Grass Hero. For all of his\ntempered muscles and his lariat and his Winchester rifle,\nhe was presently exposed as a fraud. He was just as\nLong-winded and just as Immaculate as the Victorian Hero\nthat he displaced.",
        "What the public really wants and has always wanted in\nits books is wickedness. Fiction was recognised in its\ninfancy as being a work of the devil.",
        "So the popular novel, despairing of real wickedness among\nthe cannibals, and in the ruined tower at midnight, and\non the open-air of the prairies, shifted its scenes again.\nIt came indoors. It came back to the city. And it gave\nus the new crop of heroes and heroines and the scenes\nand settings with which the fiction of to-day has replaced\nthe Heroes and Heroines of Yesterday. The Lure of the\nCity is its theme. It pursues its course to the music of\nthe ukalele, in the strident racket of the midnight\ncabaret. Here move the Harvard graduate in his dinner\njacket, drunk at one in the morning. Here is the hard\nface of Big Business scowling at its desk; and here the\nglittering Heroine of the hour in her dress of shimmering\nsequins, making such tepid creatures as Madeline and Kate\nlook like the small change out of a twenty-five cent\nshinplaster.",

        "“No greater power for education,” said President Shurman\nthe other day, “has come among us during the last forty\nyears than the moving picture.”",
        "I am not certain that it was President Shurman. And he\nmay not have said it the other day. Nor do I feel absolutely\nsure that he referred to the LAST forty years. Indeed\nnow that I come to think of it, I don’t believe it WAS\nShurman. In fact it may have been ex-President Eliot. Or\nwas it, perhaps, President Hadley of Yale? Or did I say\nit myself? Judging by the accuracy and force of the\nlanguage, I think I must have. I doubt if Shurman or\nHadley could have put it quite so neatly. There’s a touch\nabout it that I recognise.",
        "But let that pass. At any rate it is something that\neverybody is saying and thinking. All our educators have\nturned their brains towards the possibility of utilising\nmoving pictures for the purpose of education. It is being\nfreely said that history and geography, and even arithmetic,\ninstead of being taught by the slow and painful process\nof books and memory, can be imparted through the eye.",
        "I had no sooner heard of this idea than I became impassioned\nto put it into practice. I have therefore prepared, or\nam preparing, a film, especially designed for the elementary\nclasses of our schools to narrate the story of the\ndiscovery of America.",
        "This I should like the reader to sit and see with me, in\nthe eye of his imagination. But let me first give the\nplain, unvarnished account of the discovery of America\nas I took it from one of our school histories.",
        "   “Christopher Columbus, otherwise Christoforo Colombo,\n   the celebrated discoverer of America, was born of poor\n   but honest parents in the Italian city of Genoa. His\n   mother, Teresa Colombo, seems to have been a woman of\n   great piety and intelligence. Of his father, Bartolomeo\n   Colombo, nothing is recorded. From his earliest youth\n   the boy Christopher developed a passion for mathematics,\n   astronomy, geodesy, and the other sciences of the\n   day...”",
        "But, no,–stop! I am going too fast. The reader will get\nit better if we turn it into pictures bit by bit as we\ngo on.

        "There we are. That gives the child the correct historical\nbackground right away. Now what goes on next? Let me see.\nAh, yes, of course. We throw an announcement on the\nscreen, thus.",
        "CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.. Mr. Quinn",

        "Now, we are ready to begin in earnest. Let us make the\nscenario together. First idea to be expressed:",
        "“Christopher Columbus was the son of poor but honest parents.”",
        "This might seem difficult to a beginner, but to those of\nus who frequent the movies it is nothing. The reel spins\nand we see–a narrow room–(it is always narrow in the\nmovies)–to indicate straitened circumstances–cardboard\nfurniture–high chairs with carved backs–two cardboard\nbeams across the ceiling (all this means the Middle\nAges)–a long dinner table–all the little Columbuses\nseated at it–Teresa Colombo cutting bread at one end of\nit–gives a slice to each, one slice (that means poverty\nin the movies)–Teresa rolls her eyes up–all the little\nchildren put their hands together and say grace (this\nregisters honesty). The thing is done. Let us turn back\nto the history book and see what is to be put in next.",
        "”...The father of Christopher, Bartolomeo Colombo, was\na man of no especial talent of whom nothing is recorded.”",
        "That’s easy. First we announce him on the screen:",
        "BARTOLOMEO COLOMBO.. Mr. Henderson",
        "Then we stick him on the film on a corner of the room,\nleaning up against the cardboard clock and looking at\nthe children. This attitude in the movies always indicates\na secondary character of no importance. His business is\nto look at the others and to indicate forgetfulness of\nself, incompetence, unimportance, vacuity, simplicity.\nNote how this differs from the attitudes of important\ncharacters. If a movie character–one of importance–is\nplotting or scheming, he seats himself at a little round\ntable, drums on it with his fingers, and half closes one\neye. If he is being talked to, or having a letter or\ndocument or telegram read to him, he stands “facing full\"\nand working his features up and down to indicate emotion\nsweeping over them. If he is being “exposed” (which is\ndone by pointing fingers at him), he hunches up like a\nsnake in an angle of the room with both eyes half shut\nand his mouth set as if he had just eaten a lemon. But\nif he has none of these things to express and is only in\nthe scene as a background for the others, then he goes\nover and leans in an easy attitude against the tall\ncardboard clock.",
        "That then is the place for Bartolomeo Colombo. To the\nclock with him.",
        "Now what comes next?",
        "”...The young Christopher developed at an early age a\npassion for study, and especially for astronomy, geometry,\ngeodesy, and the exact science of the day.”",
        "Quite easy. On spins the film. Young Christopher in a\ngarret room (all movie study is done in garrets). The\ncardboard ceiling slopes within six inches of his head.\nThis shows that the boy never rises from his books. He\ncan’t. On a table in front of him is a little globe and\na pair of compasses. Christopher spins the globe round.\nThen he makes two circles with the compasses, one after\nthe other, very carefully. This is the recognised movie\nsymbol for mathematical research.",
        "So there we have Christopher–poor, honest, studious,\nfull of circles.",
        "Now to the book again.",
        "”...The young Columbus received his education at the\nmonastery of the Franciscan monks at Genoa. Here he spent\nseven years.”",
        "Yes, but we can put that on the screen in seven seconds.",
        "Turn on the film.",
        "Movie Monastery–exterior, done in grey cardboard–ding,\ndong, ding, dong (man in the orchestra with triangle and\nstick)–procession of movie friars–faces more like thugs,\nbut never mind–they are friars because they walk two\nand two in a procession, singing out of hymn books.",
        "Now for the book again.",

All\nthis shows study, progress, application. The friars are delighted\nwith the boy.",
        "”...Christopher, after seven years of study, reaches the\nfirm conviction that the world is round.”",
        "Picture. Christopher–with his globe–jumps up from\ntable–passes his fingers round and round the\nglobe–registers the joy of invention–seats himself at\ntable and draws circles with his compasses furiously. He\nfades out.",
        "”...Fired with his discovery Christopher sets out from\nthe monastery.”",
        "Stop a minute, this is a little hard. Fired. How can we\nshow Christopher “fired.” We can’t. Perhaps he’ll be\nfired if the film is no good, but we must omit it just\nnow.",
        "“He sets out.”",
        "One second only for this. Monastery door (double cardboard\nwith iron across it)–Christopher leaving–carries a\nwallet to mean distance. Fra Giacomo blessing him–fade\nout.",
        "”...For eighteen years Columbus vainly travelled through\nthe world on foot offering his discovery at the courts\nof Europe, in vain, though asking nothing in return for\nit except a fleet of ships, two hundred men and provisions\nfor two years.”",
        "To anybody not used to scenarios this looks a large order.\nEighteen years seems difficult to put on the screen. In\nreality this is exactly where the trained movie man sees\nhis chance. Here he can put in anything and everything\nthat he likes, bringing in, in a slightly mediaeval form,\nall his favourite movie scenes.",
        "Thus, for example, here we have first the good old midnight\ncabaret supper scene–thinly disguised as the court of\nthe King of Sardinia. To turn a cabaret into a court the\nmovie men merely exchange their Fifth Avenue evening\ndress for short coats and knee breeches, heavily wadded\nand quilted, and wear large wigs. Quilted pants and wigs\nregister courtiers, the courtiers of anybody–Charlemagne,\nQueen Elizabeth, Peter the Great, Louis Quatorze, anybody\nand everybody who ever had courtiers. Just as men with\nbare legs mean Romans, men in pea-jackets mean detectives,\nand young men drunk in evening dress Harvard graduates.",
        "The ladies at the court of Sardinia wear huge paper frills\nround their necks. Otherwise it is the cabaret scene with\nthe familiar little tables, and the ukaleles going like\nmad in one corner, and black sarsaparilla being poured\nfoaming into the glasses.",
        "In this scene Columbus moves up and down, twirling his\nlittle globe and looking appealingly in their faces. All\nlaugh at him. His part is just the same as that of the\npoor little girl trying to sell up-state violets in the\nmidnight cabaret.",
        "The Court of Sardinia fades and the film shows Columbus\nvainly soliciting financial aid from Lorenzo the\nMagnificent.",
        "Stop one minute, please.",
        "LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT... Mr. L. Evans",
        "This scene again is old and familiar. It is the well-known\ninterior representing the Grinding Capitalist, or the\nBitter Banker refusing aid to the boy genius who has\ninvented a patent pea-rake. The only change is that\nLorenzo wears a huge wig, has no telephone, and handles\na large quill pen (to register Middle Ages) which he\nwiggles furiously up and down on a piece of parchment.",
        "So the eighteen years, with scenes of this sort turn out\nthe easiest part of the whole show.",
        "But let us to the book again.",
        "”...After eighteen years Columbus, now past the prime of\nlife, is presented at the Court of Queen Isabella of\nSpain.”",
        "Just half a moment.",
        "QUEEN ISABELLA.. Miss Janet Briggs",
        "There will be very probably at this point a slight applause\nfrom the back of the hall. Miss Briggs was here last\nweek, or her astral body was–as Maggie of the Cattle\nRanges. The impression that she made is passed on to\nIsabella.",
        "“The Queen and her consort, King Ferdinand of Aragon...”",
        "Stop, stick him on the film.",
        "FERDINAND OF ARAGON.. Mr. Edward Giles",
        "(Large wig, flat velvet cap and square whiskers–same\nmake-up as for Ferdinand of Bulgaria, Ferdinand of Bohemia,\nor any of the Ferdinands.)",
        "”...were immediately seized with enthusiasm for the\nmarvellous discovery of the Genoese adventurer.”",
        "Picture. Columbus hands his globe to Isabella and his\ncompasses to Ferdinand. They register delight and\nastonishment. The Queen turns the globe round and round\nand holds it up to Ferdinand. Both indicate with their\nfaces, well-what-do-you-know-about-this. Ferdinand makes\na circle with the compasses on a table–the courtiers,\nfickle creatures, crowd around. They are still dressed\nas in Sardinia eighteen years ago. In fact, one recognises\nquite a lot of them. When Ferdinand draws the circle they\nfall back in wild astonishment, gesticulating frantically.\nWhat they mean is, “It’s a circle, it’s a circle.”",
        "“The King and Queen at once place three ships at the\ndisposal of Columbus.”",
        "On with the picture. The harbour of the port of Palos–\nships bobbing up and down (it is really the oyster boats\nin Baltimore Bay but it looks just like Palos, or near\nenough). Notice Queen Isabella on the right, at the top\nof a flight of steps, extending her hand and looking at\nColumbus. Her gesture means, “Pick a ship, any ship you\nlike, any colour.” Just as if she were saying, “Pick a\ncard, any card you like.”",
        "We turn again to the history.",
        "”...Christopher Columbus, now arrived at the height of\nhis desire, sets out upon his memorable voyage accompanied\nby a hundred companions in three caravels, the Pinta,\nthe Nina and the Espiritu Santo.”",
        "Ah, here we have the movie work–the real thing. Cardboard\ncaravel tossing on black water–seen first right close\nto us–we are almost on board of it. Notice the movie\nsailors with black whiskers and bare feet (bare feet in\nthe movies always means a sailor, and black whiskers mean\nSpaniards). Now we see the caravel a little way out–whoop!\nHow she bobs up and down! They give her that jolt (it’s\ndone with the machine itself) to mean danger. There are\nall three caravels–Hoop–er–oo! See them go up and\ndown–stormy night coming all right. See the sun setting\nin the west, over the water? They’re heading straight\nfor it. Good-night Columbus–take care of yourself out\nthere in the blackness.",
        "“During the voyage Columbus remained continually on deck.\nSleeping at the prow, his face towards the new world, he\nsaw already in his dreams the accomplishment of his\nhopes.”",
        "On goes the picture. Christopher in the prow of the\ncaravel (in the movies a prow is made by putting two\nlittle board fences together and propping up a bowsprit\nlengthwise over them). Columbus sits up, peers intently\ninto the darkness, his hand to his brow–registers a\nlook. Do I see America? No. Lies down, shuts his eyes\nand falls into an instantaneous movie sleep. His face\nfades out slowly to music, which means that he is going\nto dream. Then on the screen the announcement is shown:",
        "SPIRIT OF AMERICA... Miss E. Dickenson",
        "and here we have Miss Dickenson floating in the air above\nColumbus. She wears nothing except mosquito netting, but\nshe has got on enough of it to get past the censor of\nthe State of New York. Just enough, apparently.",
        "Miss E. Dickenson is joined by a whole troop of Miss Dickensons\nall in white mosquito netting. They go through a series of\nbeautiful evolutions, floating over the sleeping figure of\nColumbus. The dance they do is meant to typify, or rather to\nsignify,–as a matter of fact we needn’t worry much about what\nit signified. It is an allegory, done in white mosquito netting.\nThat is generally held to be quite enough. Let us go back to\nthe book–",
        "“After a storm-tossed voyage of three months...”",
        "Wait a bit. Turn on the picture again and toss the caravels\nup and down.",
        "”...during which the food supply threatened to fail...”",
        "Put that on the screen, please. Columbus surrounded by\nten sailors, dividing up a potato.",
        "”...the caravels arrived in safety at the beautiful island\nof San Salvador. Columbus, bearing the banner of Spain,\nstepped first ashore. Surrounded by a wondering crowd of\nsavages he prostrated himself upon the beach and kissed\nthe soil of the New World that he had discovered.”",
        "All this is so easy that it’s too easy. It runs into\npictures of itself. Anybody, accustomed to the movies,\ncan see Columbus with his banner and the movie savages\nhopping up and down around him. Movie savages are gay,\ngladsome creatures anyway, and hopping up and down is\ntheir chief mode of expressing themselves. Add to them\na sandy beach, with palm trees waving visibly in the wind\n(it is always windy in the movies) and the thing is done.",
        "Just one further picture is needed to complete the film.",
        "“Columbus who returned to Europe to lay at the feet of\nthe Spanish sovereigns the world he had discovered, fell\npresently under the disfavour of the court, and died in\npoverty and obscurity, a victim of the ingratitude of\nprinces.”",
        "Last picture. Columbus dying under the poignant\ncircumstances known only in the movies–a garret\nroom–ceiling lower than ever–a truckle bed, narrow\nenough to kill him if all else failed–Teresa Colombo\nhis aged mother alone at his bedside–she offers him\nmedicine in a long spoon–(this shows, if nothing else\nwould, that the man is ill)–he shakes his head–puts\nout his hand and rests it on the little globe–reaches\nfeebly for his compasses–can’t manage it–rolls up his\neyes and fades.",
        "The music plays softly and the inexorable film, like\nthe reel of life itself, spins on, announcing",
        "   At this theatre\n   All next week",
        "   MAGGIE MAY\n      and\n   WALTER CURRAN\n      in\n   IS IT WORTH IT",
        "And after that I can imagine the audience dispersing,\nand the now educated children going off to their homes\nand one saying as he enters–",
        "“Gee, I seen a great picture show at school to-day.”",
        "“Yes?” says his mother, “and what was it?”",
        "“Oh, it was all about a gink that went round the cabarets\ntrying to sell an invention what he’d got but nobody\nwouldn’t look at it till at last one dame gave him three\noyster boats, see? and so he and a lot of other guys\nloaded them up and hiked off across the ocean.”",
        "“And where did he go to?”",
        "“Africa. And he and the other guys had a great stand in\nwith the natives and he’d have sold his invention all\nright but one old dame got him alone in a hut and poisoned\nhim and took it off him.”",
        "That, I think, is about the way the film would run. When\nit is finished I must get President Shurman, or whoever\nit was, to come and see it.",
        "4.–Politics from Within",
        "To avoid all error as to the point of view, let me say\nin commencing that I am a Liberal Conservative, or, if\nyou will, a Conservative Liberal with a strong dash of\nsympathy with the Socialist idea, a friend of Labour,\nand a believer in Progressive Radicalism. I do not desire\noffice but would take a seat in the Canadian Senate at\nfive minutes notice.",
        "I believe there are ever so many people of exactly this\nway of thinking.",
        "Let me say further than in writing of “politics” I am\nonly dealing with the lights and shadows that flicker\nover the surface, and am not trying to discuss, still\nless to decry, the deep and vital issues that lie below.",
        "Yet I will say that vital though the issues may be below\nthe surface, there is more clap-trap, insincerity and\nhumbug on the surface of politics than over any equal\narea on the face of any institution.",
        "The candidate, as such, is a humbug. The voters, as\nvoters–not as fathers, brothers or sons–are humbugs.\nThe committees are humbugs. And the speeches to the extent\nof about ninety per cent are pure buncombe. But, oddly\nenough, out of the silly babel of talk that accompanies\npopular government, we get, after all, pretty good\ngovernment–infinitely better than the government of an\nautocratic king. Between democracy and despotic kingship\nlies all the difference between genial humbug and black\nsin.",
        "For the candidate for popular office I have nothing but\nsympathy and sorrow. It has been my fortune to walk round\nat the heels of half a dozen of them in different little\nCanadian towns, watching the candidate try in vain to\nbrighten up his face at the glad sight of a party voter.",
        "One, in particular, I remember. Nature had meant him to\nbe a sour man, a hard man, a man with but little joy in\nthe company of his fellows. Fate had made him a candidate\nfor the House of Commons. So he was doing his best to\nbelie his nature.",
        "“Hullo, William!” he would call out as a man passed\ndriving a horse and buggy, “got the little sorrel out\nfor a spin, eh?”",
        "Then he would turn to me and say in a low rasping voice–",
        "“There goes about the biggest skunk in this whole\nconstituency.”",
        "A few minutes later he would wave his hand over a little\nhedge in friendly salutation to a man working in a garden.",
        "“Hullo, Jasper! That’s a fine lot of corn you’ve got\nthere.”",
        "Jasper replied in a growl. And when we were well past\nthe house the candidate would say between his teeth–",
        "“That’s about the meanest whelp in the riding.”",
        "Our conversation all down the street was of that pattern.",
        "“Good morning, Edward! Giving the potatoes a dose of\nParis green, eh?”",
        "And in an undertone–",
        "“I wish to Heaven he’d take a dose of it himself.”",
        "And so on from house to house.",
        "I counted up, from one end of the street to the other,\nthat there were living in it seven skunks, fourteen low\nwhelps, eight mean hounds and two dirty skinflints. And\nall of these merely among the Conservative voters. It\nmade me wish to be a Liberal. Especially as the Liberal\nvoters, by the law of the perversity of human affairs,\nalways seemed to be the finer lot. As they were NOT voting\nfor our candidate, they were able to meet him in a fair\nand friendly way, whereas William and Jasper and Edward\nand our “bunch” were always surly and hardly deigned to\ngive more than a growl in answer to the candidate’s\ngreeting, without even looking up at him.",
        "But a Liberal voter would stop him in the street and\nshake hands and say in a frank, cordial way.",
        "“Mr. Grouch, I’m sorry indeed that I can’t vote for you,\nand I’d like to be able to wish you success, but of course\nyou know I’m on the other side and always have been and\ncan’t change now.”",
        "Whereupon the Candidate would say. “That’s all right,\nJohn, I don’t expect you to. I can respect a man’s\nconvictions all right, I guess.”",
        "So they would part excellent friends, the Candidate saying\nas we moved off:",
        "“That man, John Winter, is one of the straightest men in\nthis whole county.”",
        "Then he would add–",
        "“Now we’ll just go into this house for a minute. There’s\na dirty pup in here that’s one of our supporters.”",
        "My opinion of our own supporters went lower every day,\nand my opinion of the Liberal voters higher, till it so\nhappened that I went one day to an old friend of mine\nwho was working on the Liberal side. I asked him how he\nliked it.",
        "“Oh, well enough!” he said, “as a sort of game. But in\nthis constituency you’ve got all the decent voters; our\nvoters are the lowest bunch of skunks I ever struck.”",
        "Just then a man passed in a buggy, and looked sourly at\nmy friend the Liberal worker.",
        "“Hullo, John!” he called, with a manufactured hilarity,\n“got the little mare out for a turn, eh?”",
        "John grunted.",
        "“There’s one of them,” said my friend, “the lowest pup\nin this county, John Winter.”",
        "“Come along,” said the Candidate to me one morning, “I\nwant you to meet my committee.”",
        "“You’ll find them,” he said confidingly, as we started\ndown the street towards the committee rooms, “an awful\nbunch of mutts.”",
        "“Too bad,” I said, “what’s wrong with them?”",
        "“Oh, I don’t know–they’re just a pack of simps. They\ndon’t seem to have any PUNCH in them. The one you’ll meet\nfirst is the chairman–he’s about the worst dub of the\nlot; I never saw a man with so little force in my life.\nHe’s got no magnetism, that’s what’s wrong with him–no\nmagnetism.”",
        "A few minutes later the Candidate was introducing me to\na roomful of heavy looking Committee men. Committee men\nin politics, I notice, have always a heavy bovine look.\nThey are generally in a sort of daze, or doped from\nsmoking free cigars.",
        "“Now I want to introduce you first,” said the Candidate,\n“to our chairman, Mr. Frog. Mr. Frog is our old battle\nhorse in this constituency. And this is our campaign\nsecretary Mr. Bughouse, and Mr. Dope, and Mr. Mudd, et\ncetera.”",
        "Those may not have been their names.",
        "It is merely what the names sounded like when one was\nlooking into their faces.",
        "The Candidate introduced them all as battle horses, battle\naxes, battle leaders, standard bearers, flag-holders,\nand so forth. If he had introduced them as hat-racks or\ncigar holders, it would have been nearer the mark.",
        "Presently the Candidate went out and I was left with the\nbattle-axes.",
        "“What do you think of our chances?” I asked.",
        "The battle-axes shook their heads with dubious looks.",
        "“Pretty raw deal,” said the Chairman, “the Convention\nwishing HIM on us.” He pointed with his thumb over his\nshoulder to indicate the departed Candidate.",
        "“What’s wrong with him?” I asked.",
        "Mr. Frog shook his head again.",
        "“No PUNCH,” he said.",
        "“None at all,” agreed all the battle horses.",
        "“I’ll tell you,” said the Campaign secretary, Mr. Bughouse,\na voluble man, with wandering eyes–\"the trouble is he\nhas no magnetism, no personal magnetism.”",
        "“I see,” I said.",
        "“Now, you take this man, Shortis, that the Liberals have\ngot hold of,” continued Mr. Bughouse, “he’s full of\nMAGNETISM. He appeals.”",
        "All the other Committee men nodded.",
        "“That’s so,” they murmured, “magnetism, Our man hasn’t\na darned ounce of it.”",
        "“I met Shortis the other night in the street,” went on\nMr. Bughouse, “and he said, ’Come on up to my room in\nthe hotel.’ ’Oh,’ I said, ’I can’t very well.’ ’Nonsense,’\nhe said, ’You’re on the other side but what does that\nmatter?’ Well, we went up to his room, and there he had\nwhiskey, and gin, and lager,–everything. ’Now,’ he says,\n’name your drink–what is it?’ There he was, right in\nhis room, breaking the law without caring a darn about\nit. Well, you know the voters like that kind of thing.\nIt appeals to them.”",
        "“Well,” said another of the Committee men,–I think it\nwas the one called Mr. Dope, “I wouldn’t mind that so\nmuch. But the chief trouble about our man, to my mind,\nis that he can’t speak.”",
        "“He can’t?” I exclaimed.",
        "All the Committee shook their heads.",
        "“Not for sour apples!” asserted Mr. Dope positively.\n“Now, in this riding that won’t do. Our people here are\nused to first class speaking, they expect it. I suppose\nthere has been better speaking in this Constituency than\nanywhere else in the whole dominion. Not lately, perhaps;\nnot in the last few elections. But I can remember, and\nso can some of the boys here, the election when Sir John\nA. spoke here, when the old Mackenzie government went\nout.”",
        "He looked around at the circle. Several nodded.",
        "“Remember it as well,” assented Mr. Mudd, “as if it were\nyesterday.”",
        "“Well, sir,” continued Mr. Dope, “I’ll never forget Sir\nJohn A. speaking here in the Odd Fellows’ Hall, eh?”",
        "The Committee men nodded and gurgled in corroboration.",
        "“My! but he was PLASTERED. We had him over at Pete\nRobinson’s hotel all afternoon, and I tell you he was\nplastered for fair. We ALL were. I remember I was so\npickled myself I could hardly help Sir John up the steps\nof the platform. So were you, Mudd, do you remember?”",
        "“I certainly was!” said Mr. Mudd proudly. Committee men\nwho would scorn to drink lager beer in 1919, take a great\npride, I have observed, in having been pickled in 1878.",
        "“Yes, sir,” continued Mr. Dope, “you certainly were\npickled. I remember just as well as anything, when they\nopened the doors and let the crowd in: all the boys had\nbeen bowling up and were pretty well soused. You never\nsaw such a crowd. Old Dr. Greenway (boys, you remember\nthe old Doc) was in the chair, and he was pretty well\nspifflocated. Well, sir, Sir John A. got up in that hall\nand he made the finest, most moving speech I ever listened\nto. Do you remember when he called old Trelawney an\nash-barrel? And when he made that appeal for a union of\nhearts and said that the sight of McGuire (the Liberal\ncandidate) made him sick? I tell you those were great\ndays. You don’t get speaking like that now; and you don’t\nget audiences like that now either. Not the same calibre.”",
        "All the Committee shook their heads.",
        "“Well, anyway, boys,” said the Chairman, as he lighted\na fresh cigar, “to-morrow will decide, one way or the\nother. We’ve certainly worked hard enough,\"–here he\npassed the box of cigars round to the others–\"I haven’t\nbeen in bed before two any night since the work started.”",
        "“Neither have I,” said another of the workers. “I was\njust saying to the wife when I got up this morning that\nI begin to feel as if I never wanted to see the sight of\na card again.”",
        "“Well, I don’t regret the work,” said the Secretary, “so\nlong as we carry the riding. You see,” he added in\nexplanation to me, “we’re up against a pretty hard\nproposition here. This riding really is Liberal: they’ve\ngot the majority of voters though we HAVE once or twice\nswung it Conservative. But whether we can carry it with\na man like Grouch is hard to say. One thing is certain,\nboys, if he DOES carry it, he doesn’t owe it to himself.”",
        "All the battle horses agreed on this. A little after that\nwe dispersed.",
        "And twenty-four hours later the vote was taken and to my\nintense surprise the riding was carried by Grouch the\nConservative candidate.",
        "I say, to MY surprise. But apparently not to anybody else.",
        "For it appeared this (was in conversations after the\nelection) that Grouch was a man of extraordinary magnetism.\nHe had, so they said, “punch.” Shortis, the Liberal, it\nseemed, lacked punch absolutely. Even his own supporters\nadmitted that he had no personality whatever. Some wondered\nhow he had the nerve to run.",
        "But my own theory of how the election was carried is\nquite different.",
        "I feel certain that all the Conservative voters despised\ntheir candidate so much that they voted Liberal. And all\nthe Liberals voted Conservative.",
        "That carried the riding.",
        "Meantime Grouch left the constituency by the first train\nnext day for Ottawa. Except for paying taxes on his house,\nhe will not be back in the town till they dissolve\nparliament again.",
        "5.–The Lost Illusions of Mr. Sims",
        "In the club to which I belong, in a quiet corner where\nthe sunlight falls in sideways, there may be seen sitting\nof an afternoon my good friend of thirty years’ standing,\nMr. Edward Sims. Being somewhat afflicted with gout, he\ngenerally sits with one foot up on a chair. On a brass\ntable beside him are such things as Mr. Sims needs. But\nthey are few. Wealthy as he is, the needs of Mr. Sims\nreach scarcely further than Martini cocktails and Egyptian\ncigarettes. Such poor comforts as these, brought by a\ndeferential waiter, with, let us say, a folded newspaper\nat five o’clock, suffice for all his wants. Here sits\nMr. Sims till the shadows fall in the street outside,\nwhen a limousine motor trundles up to the club and rolls\nhim home.",
        "And here of an afternoon Mr. Sims talks to me of his\ncollege days when he was young. The last thirty years of\nhis life have moved in so gentle a current upon so smooth\na surface that they have been without adventure. It is\nthe stormy period of his youth that preoccupies my friend\nas he sits looking from the window of the club at the\nwaving leaves in the summer time and the driving snow in\nthe winter.",
        "I am of that habit of mind that makes me prone to listen.\nAnd for this, perhaps, Mr. Sims selects me as the recipient\nof the stories of his college days. It is, it seems, the\nfixed belief of my good friend that when he was young he\nbelonged at college to a particularly nefarious crowd or\ngroup that exists in his mind under the name of the “old\ngang.” The same association, or corporate body or whatever\nit should be called, is also designated by Mr. Sims, the\n“old crowd,” or more simply and affectionately “the boys.\"\nIn the recollection of my good friend this “old gang\"\nwere of a devilishness since lost off the earth. Work\nthey wouldn’t. Sleep they despised. While indoors they\nplayed poker in a blue haze of tobacco smoke with beer\nin jugs and mugs all round them. All night they were out\nof doors on the sidewalk with linked arms, singing songs\nin chorus and jeering at the city police.",
        "Yet in spite of life such as this, which might appear to\nan outsider wearing to the intellect, the “old gang” as\nrecollected by Mr. Sims were of a mental brilliancy that\neclipses everything previous or subsequent. McGregor of\nthe Class of ’85 graduated with a gold medal in Philosophy\nafter drinking twelve bottles of lager before sitting\ndown to his final examination. Ned Purvis, the football\nhalf-back, went straight from the football field after\na hard game with his ankle out of joint, drank half a\nbottle of Bourbon Rye and then wrote an examination in\nGreek poetry that drew tears from the President of the\ncollege.",
        "Mr. Sims is perhaps all the more prone to talk of these\nearly days insomuch that, since his youth, life, in the\nmere material sense, has used him all too kindly. At an\nearly age, indeed at about the very time of his graduation,\nMr. Sims came into money,–not money in the large and\nfrenzied sense of a speculative fortune, begetting care\nand breeding anxiety, but in the warm and comfortable\ninheritance of a family brewery, about as old and as\nwell-established as the Constitution of the United States.\nIn this brewery, even to-day, Mr. Sims, I believe, spends\na certain part, though no great part, of his time. He is\ncarried to it, I understand, in his limousine in the\nsunnier hours of the morning; for an hour or so each day\nhe moves about among the warm smell of the barley and\nthe quiet hum of the machinery murmuring among its dust.",
        "There is, too, somewhere in the upper part of the city\na huge, silent residence, where a noiseless butler adjusts\nMr. Sims’s leg on a chair and serves him his dinner in\nisolated luxury.",
        "But the residence, and the brewery, and with them the\ncurrent of Mr. Sims’s life move of themselves.",
        "Thus has care passed Mr. Sims by, leaving him stranded\nin a club chair with his heavy foot and stick beside him.",
        "Mr. Sims is a bachelor. Nor is he likely now to marry:\nbut this through no lack of veneration or respect for\nthe sex. It arises, apparently, from the fact that when\nMr. Sims was young, during his college days, the beauty\nand charm of the girls who dwelt in his college town was\nsuch as to render all later women mere feeble suggestions\nof what might have been. There was, as there always is,\none girl in particular. I have not heard my friend speak\nmuch of her. But I gather that Kate Dashaway was the kind\nof girl who might have made a fit mate even for the sort\nof intellectual giant that flourished at Mr. Sims’s college.\nShe was not only beautiful. All the girls remembered by\nMr. Sims were that. But she was in addition “a good head\"\nand “a good sport,” two of the highest qualities that, in\nMr. Sims’s view, can crown the female sex. She had, he\nsaid, no “nonsense” about her, by which term Mr. Sims\nindicated religion. She drank lager beer, played tennis as\nwell as any man in the college, and smoked cigarettes a\nwhole generation in advance of the age.",
        "Mr. Sims, so I gather, never proposed to her, nor came\nwithin a measurable distance of doing so. A man so prone,\nas is my friend, to spend his time in modest admiration\nof the prowess of others is apt to lag behind. Miss\nDashaway remains to Mr. Sims, as all else does, a retrospect\nand a regret.",
        "But the chief peculiarities of the old gang–as they\nexist in the mind of Mr. Sims–is the awful fate that\nhas overwhelmed them. It is not merely that they are\nscattered to the four corners of the continent. That\nmight have been expected. But, apparently, the most awful\nmoral ruin has fallen upon them. That, at least, is the\nabiding belief of Mr. Sims.",
        "“Do you ever hear anything of McGregor now?” I ask him\nsometimes.",
        "“No,” he says, shaking his head quietly. “I understand\nhe went all to the devil.”",
        "“How was that?”",
        "“Booze,” says Mr. Sims. There is a quiet finality about\nthe word that ends all discussion.",
        "“Poor old Curly!” says Mr. Sims, in speaking of another\nof his classmates. “I guess he’s pretty well down and\nout these days.”",
        "“What’s the trouble?” I say.",
        "Mr. Sims moves his eyes sideways as he sits. It is easier\nthan moving his head.",
        "“Booze,” he says.",
        "Even apparent success in life does not save Mr. Sims’s\nfriends.",
        "“I see,” I said one day, “that they have just made Arthur\nStewart a Chief Justice out west.”",
        "“Poor old Artie,” murmured Mr. Sims. “He’ll have a hard\ntime holding it down. I imagine he’s pretty well tanked\nup all the time these days.”",
        "When Mr. Sims has not heard of any of his associates for\na certain lapse of years, he decides to himself that they\nare down and out. It is a form of writing them off. There\nis a melancholy satisfaction in it. As the years go by\nMr. Sims is coming to regard himself and a few others as\nthe lonely survivors of a great flood. All the rest,\nbrilliant as they once were, are presumed to be “boozed,\"\n“tanked,” “burnt out,” “bust-up,” and otherwise consumed.",
        "After having heard for so many years the reminiscences\nof my good friend about the old gang, it seemed almost\nincredible that one of them should step into actual living\nbeing before my eyes. Yet so it happened.",
        "I found Mr. Sims at the club one day, about to lunch\nthere, a thing contrary to his wont. And with him was a\nfriend, a sallow, insignificant man in the middle fifties,\nwith ragged, sandy hair, wearing thin.",
        "“Shake hands with Tommy Vidal,” said Mr. Sims proudly.",
        "If he had said, “Shake hands with Aristotle,” he couldn’t\nhave spoken with greater pride.",
        "This then was Tommy Vidal, the intellectual giant of whom\nI had heard a hundred times. Tommy had, at college, so\nMr. Sims had often assured me, the brightest mind known\nsince the age of Pericles. He took the prize in Latin\npoetry absolutely “without opening a book.” Latin to\nTommy Vidal had been, by a kind of natural gift, born in\nhim. In Latin he was “a whale.” Indeed in everything. He\nhad passed his graduation examination with first class\nhonours; “plastered.” He had to be held in his seat, so\nit was recorded, while he wrote.",
        "Tommy, it seemed, had just “blown in” to town that morning.\nIt was characteristic of Mr. Sims’s idea of the old gang\nthat the only way in which any of them were supposed to\nenter a town was to “blow in.”",
        "“When did you say you ’blew in,’ Tommy?” he asked about\nhalf a dozen times during our lunch. In reality, the\nreckless, devil-may-care fellow Vidal had “blown in” to\nbring his second daughter to a boarding school–a thing\nno doubt contemplated months ahead. But Mr. Sims insisted\nin regarding Tommy’s movements as purely fortuitous, the\nsport of chance. He varied his question by asking “When\ndo you expect to ’blow out’ Tommy?” Tommy’s answers he\nforgot at once.",
        "We sat and talked after lunch, and it pained me to notice\nthat Tommy Vidal was restless and anxious to get away.\nMr. Sims offered him cigars, thick as ropes and black as\nnight, but he refused them. It appeared that he had long\nsince given up smoking. It affected his eyes, he said.\nThe deferential waiter brought brandy and curacoa in long\nthin glasses. But Mr. Vidal shook his head. He hadn’t\nhad a drink, he said, for twenty years. He found it\naffected his hearing. Coffee, too, he refused. It affected,\nso it seemed, his sense of smell. He sat beside us, ill\nat ease, and anxious, as I could see, to get back to his\nsecond daughter and her schoolmistresses. Mr. Sims, who\nis geniality itself in his heart, but has no great powers\nin conversation, would ask Tommy if he remembered how he\nacted as Antigone in the college play, and was “plastered\"\nfrom the second act on. Mr. Vidal had no recollection of\nit, but wondered if there was any good book-store in town\nwhere he could buy his daughter an Algebra. He rose when\nhe decently could and left us. As Mr. Sims saw it, he\n“blew out.”",
        "Mr. Sims is kindliness itself in his judgments. He passed\nno word of censure on his departed friend. But a week or\nso later he mentioned to me in conversation that Tommy\nVidal had “turned into a kind of stiff.” The vocabulary\nof Mr. Sims holds no term of deeper condemnation than\nthe word “stiff.” To be a “stiff” is the last form of\ndegradation.",
        "It is strange that when a thing happens once, it forthwith\nhappens twice or even more. For years no member of the\n“old gang” had come in touch with Mr. Sims. Yet the visit\nof Tommy Vidal was followed at no great distance of time\nby the “blowing in” of Ned Purvis.",
        "“Well, well!” said Mr. Sims, as he opened one afternoon\na telegram that the deferential waiter brought upon a\ntray. “This beats all! Old Ned Purvis wires that he’s,\ngoing to blow in to town to-night at seven.”",
        "Forthwith Mr. Sims fell to ordering dinner for the three\nof us in a private room, with enough of an assortment of\ngin cocktails and Scotch highballs to run a distillery,\nand enough Vichy water and imported soda for a bath. “I\nknow old Ned!” he said as he added item after item to\nthe list.",
        "At seven o’clock the waiter whispered, as in deep\nconfidence, that there was a gentleman below for Mr.\nSims.",
        "It so happened that on that evening my friend’s foot was\nin bad shape, and rested on a chair. At his request I\nwent from the lounge room of the club downstairs to\nwelcome the new arrival.",
        "Purvis I knew all about. My friend had spoken of him a\nthousand times. He had played half-back on the football\nteam–a big hulking brute of a fellow. In fact, he was,\nas pictured by Mr. Sims, a perfect colossus. And he played\nfootball–as did all Mr. Sims’s college chums–\"plastered.\"\n“Old Ned,” so Mr. Sims would relate, “was pretty well\n’soused’ when the game started: but we put a hose at him\nat half-time and got him into pretty good shape.” All\nmen in any keen athletic contest, as remembered by Mr.\nSims, were pretty well “tanked up.” For the lighter,\nnimbler games such as tennis, they were reported\n“spifflocated” and in that shape performed prodigies of\nagility.",
        "“You’ll know Ned,” said Mr. Sims, “by his big shoulders.\"\nI went downstairs.",
        "The reception room below was empty, except for one man,\na little, gentle-looking man with spectacles. He wore\nblack clothes with a waistcoat reaching to the throat,\na white tie and a collar buttoned on backwards. Ned Purvis\nwas a clergyman! His great hulking shoulders had gone\nthe way of all my good friend’s reminiscences.",
        "I brought him upstairs.",
        "For a moment, in the half light of the room, Mr. Sims\nwas still deceived.",
        "“Well, Ned!” he began heartily, with a struggle to rise\nfrom his chair–then he saw the collar and tie of the\nRev. Mr. Purvis, and the full horror of the thing dawned\nupon him. Nor did the three gin cocktails, which Mr. Sims\nhad had stationed ready for the reunion, greatly help\nits geniality. Yet it had been a maxim, in the recollections\nof Mr. Sims, that when any of the boys blew in anywhere\nthe bringing of drinks must be instantaneous and uproarious.",
        "Our dinner that night was very quiet.",
        "Mr. Purvis drank only water. That, with a little salad,\nmade his meal. He had a meeting to address that evening\nat eight, a meeting of women–\"dear women” he called\nthem–who had recently affiliated their society with the\nwork that some of the dear women in Mr. Purvis’s own town\nwere carrying on. The work, as described, boded no good\nfor breweries. Mr. Purvis’s wife, so it seemed, was with\nhim and would also “take the platform.”",
        "As best we could we made conversation.",
        "“I didn’t know that you were married,” said Mr. Sims.",
        "“Yes,” said Mr. Purvis, “married, and with five dear boys\nand three dear girls.” The eight of them, he told us,\nwere a great blessing. So, too, was his wife–a great\nsocial worker, it seemed, in the cause of women’s rights\nand a marvellous platform speaker in the temperance\ncrusade.",
        "“By the way, Mr. Sims,” said Mr. Purvis (they had called\none another “Mr.” after the first five minutes), “you\nmay remember my wife. I think perhaps you knew her in\nour college days. She was a Miss Dashaway.”",
        "Mr. Sims bowed his head over his plate, as another of\nhis lost illusions vanished into thin air.",
        "After Mr. Purvis had gone, my friend spoke out his\nmind–once and once only, and more in regret than anger.",
        "“I’m afraid,” he said, “that old Ned has turned into a\nSISSY.”",
        "It was only to be expected that the visits of later\nfriends–the “boys” who happened to “blow in\"–were\ndisappointments. Art Hamilton, who came next, and who\nhad been one of the most brilliant men of the Class of\n’86 had turned somehow into a “complete mutt.” Jake Todd,\nwho used to write so brilliantly in the college paper,\nas recollected by Mr. Sims, was now the editor of a big\nNew York daily. Good things might have been expected of\nhim, but it transpired that he had undergone “wizening\nof the brain.” In fact, a number of Mr. Sims’s former\nfriends had suffered from this cruel disease, consisting\napparently of a shrinkage or contraction of the cerebellum.",
        "Mr. Sims spoke little of his disappointments. But I knew\nthat he thought much about them. They set him wondering.\nThere were changes here that to the thoughtful mind called\nfor investigation.",
        "So I was not surprised when he informed me that it was\nhis intention to visit “the old place” and have a look\nat it. The “old place,” called also the “old shop,\"\nindicated, as I knew, Mr. Sims’s college, the original\nscene of the exploits of the old gang. In the thirty\nyears since he had graduated, though separated from it\nonly by two hundred miles, Mr. Sims had never revisited\nit. So is it always with the most faithful of the sons\nof learning. The illumination of the inner eye is better\nthan the crude light of reality. College reunions are\nbut for the noisy lip service of the shallow and the\ninterested. The deeper affection glows in the absent\nheart.",
        "My friend invited me to “come along.” We would, he said,\n“blow in” upon the place and have a look at it.",
        "It was in the fullness of the spring time that we went,\nwhen the leaves are out on the college campus, and when\nCommencement draws near, and when all the college, even\nthe students, are busy.",
        "Mr. Sims, I noted when I joined him at the train, was\ndressed as for the occasion. He wore a round straw hat\nwith a coloured ribbon, and light grey suit, and a necktie\nwith the garish colours of the college itself. Thus\ndressed, he leaned as lightly as his foot allowed him\nupon a yellow stick, and dreamed himself again an\nundergraduate.",
        "I had thought the purpose of his visit a mere curiosity\nbred in his disappointment. It appeared that I was wrong.\nOn the train Mr. Sims unfolded to me that his idea in\n“blowing in” upon his college was one of benefaction. He\nhad it in his mind, he said, to do something for the “old\nplace,” no less a thing than to endow a chair. He explained\nto me, modestly as was his wont, the origin of his idea.\nThe brewing business, it appeared, was rapidly reaching\na stage when it would have to be wound up. The movement\nof prohibition would necessitate, said Mr. Sims, the\nclosing of the plant. The prospect, in the financial\nsense, occasioned my friend but little excitement. I was\ngiven to understand that prohibition, in the case of Mr.\nSims’s brewery, had long since been “written off” or\n“written up” or at least written somewhere where it didn’t\nmatter. And the movement itself Mr. Sims does not regard\nas permanent. Prohibition, he says, is bound to be washed\nout by a “turn of the tide\"; in fact, he speaks of this\nreturning wave of moral regeneration much as Martin Luther\nmight have spoken of the Protestant Reformation. But for\nthe time being the brewery will close. Mr. Sims had\nthought deeply, it seemed, about putting his surplus\nfunds into the manufacture of commercial alcohol, itself\na noble profession. For some time his mind has wavered\nbetween that and endowing a chair of philosophy. There\nis, and always has been, a sort of natural connection\nbetween the drinking of beer and deep quiet thought. Mr.\nSims, as a brewer, felt that philosophy was the proper\nthing.",
        "We left the train, walked through the little town and\nentered the university gates.",
        "“Gee!” said Mr. Sims, pausing a moment and leaning on\nhis stick, “were the gates only as big as that?”",
        "We began to walk up the avenue.",
        "“I thought there were more trees to it than these,” said\nMr. Sims.",
        "“Yes,” I answered. “You often said that the avenue was\na quarter of a mile long.”",
        "“So the thing used to be,” he murmured.",
        "Then Mr. Sims looked at the campus. “A dinky looking\nlittle spot,” he said.",
        "“Didn’t you say,” I asked, “that the Arts Building was\nbuilt of white marble?”",
        "“Always thought it was,” he answered. “Looks like rough\ncast from here, doesn’t it.”",
        "“We’ll have to go in and see the President, I suppose,\"\ncontinued Mr. Sims. He said it with regret. Something of\nhis undergraduate soul had returned to his body. Although\nhe had never seen the President (this one) in his life,\nand had only read of his appointment some five years\nbefore in the newspapers, Mr. Sims was afraid of him.",
        "“Now, I tell you,” he went on. “We’ll just make a break\nin and then a quick get-away. Don’t let’s get anchored\nin there, see? If the old fellow gets talking, he’ll go\non for ever. I remember the way it used to be when a\nfellow had to go in to see Prexy in my time. The old guy\nwould start mooning away and quoting Latin and keep us\nthere half the morning.”",
        "At this moment two shabby-looking, insignificant men who\nhad evidently come out from one of the buildings, passed\nus on the sidewalk.",
        "“I wonder who those guys are,” said Mr. Sims. “Look like\nbums, don’t they?”",
        "I shook my head. Some instinct told me that they were\nprofessors. But I didn’t say so.",
        "My friend continued his instructions.",
        "“When the President asks us to lunch,” he said, “I’ll\nsay that we’re lunching with a friend down town, see?\nThen we’ll make a break and get out. If he says he wants\nto introduce us to the Faculty or anything like that,\nthen you say that we have to get the twelve-thirty to\nNew York, see? I’m not going to say anything about a\nchair in philosophy to-day. I want to read it up first\nsome night so as to be able to talk about it.”",
        "To all of this I agreed.",
        "From a janitor we inquired where to find the President.",
        "“In the Administration Building, eh?” said Mr. Sims.\n“That’s a new one on me. The building on the right, eh?\nThank you.”",
        "“See the President?” said a young lady in an ante-office.\n“I’m not sure whether you can see him just now. Have you\nan appointment?”",
        "Mr. Sims drew out a card. “Give him that” he said. On\nthe card he had scribbled “Graduate of 1887.”",
        "In a few minutes we were shown into another room where\nthere was a young man, evidently the President’s secretary,\nand a number of people waiting.",
        "“Will you kindly sit down,” murmured the young man, in\na consulting-room voice, “and wait? The President is\nengaged just now.”",
        "We waited. Through the inner door leading to the President\npeople went and came. Mr. Sims, speaking in whispers,\ncontinued to caution me on the quickness of our get-away.",
        "Presently the young man touched him on the shoulder.",
        "“The President will see you now,” he whispered.",
        "We entered the room. The “old guy” rose to meet us, Mr.\nSims’s card in his hand. But he was not old. He was at\nleast ten years younger than either of us. He was, in\nfact, what Mr. Sims and I would almost have called a boy.\nIn dress and manner he looked as spruce and busy as the\nsales manager of a shoe factory.",
        "“Delighted to see you, gentlemen,” he said, shaking hands\neffusively. “We are always pleased to see our old graduates,\nMr. Samson–No, I beg pardon, Mr. Sims–class of ’97, I\nsee–No, I beg your pardon, Class of ’67, I read it\nwrongly–”",
        "I heard Mr. Sims murmuring something that seemed to\ncontain the words “a look around.”",
        "“Yes, yes, exactly,” said the President. “A look round,\nyou’ll find a great deal to interest you in looking about\nthe place, I’m sure, Mr. Samson, great changes. I’m\nextremely sorry I can’t offer to take you round myself,\"\nhere he snapped a gold watch open and shut, “the truth\nis I have to catch the twelve-thirty to New York–so\nsorry.”",
        "Then he shook our hands again, very warmly.",
        "In another moment we were outside the door. The get-away\nwas accomplished.",
        "We walked out of the building and towards the avenue.",
        "As we passed the portals of the Arts Building, a noisy,\nrackety crowd of boys–evidently, to our eyes, schoolboys\n–came out, jostling and shouting. They swarmed past us,\naccidentally, no doubt, body-checking Mr. Sims, whose\nstraw hat was knocked off and rolled on the sidewalk.\nA janitor picked it up for him as the crowd of boys\npassed.",
        "“What pack of young bums are those?” asked Mr. Sims.\n“You oughtn’t to let young roughs like that come into\nthe buildings. Are they here from some school or something?”",
        "“No sir,” said the janitor. “They’re students.”",
        "“Students?” repeated Mr. Sims. “And what are they shouting\nlike that for?”",
        "“There’s a notice up that their professor is ill, and so\nthe class is cancelled, sir.”",
        "“Class!” said Mr. Sims. “Are those a class?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said the janitor. “That’s the Senior Class\nin Philosophy.”",
        "Mr. Sims said nothing. He seemed to limp more than his\ncustom as we passed down the avenue.",
        "On the way home on the train he talked much of crude\nalcohol and the possibilities of its commercial manufacture.",
        "So far as I know, his only benefaction up to date has\nbeen the two dollars that he gave to a hackman to drive\nus away from the college.",
        "6.–Fetching the Doctor: From Recollections of\n    Childhood in the Canadian Countryside",
        "We lived far back in the country, such as it used to be\nin Canada, before the days of telephones and motor cars,\nwith long lonely roads and snake fences buried in deep\nsnow, and with cedar swamps where the sleighs could hardly\npass two abreast. Here and there, on a winter night, one\nsaw the light in a farm house, distant and dim.",
        "Over it all was a great silence such as people who live\nin the cities can never know.",
        "And on us, as on the other families of that lonely\ncountryside, there sometimes fell the sudden alarm of\nillness, and the hurrying drive through the snow at night\nto fetch the doctor from the village, seven miles away.",
        "My elder brother and I–there was a long tribe of us, as\nwith all country families–would hitch up the horse by\nthe light of the stable lantern, eager with haste and\nsick with fear, counting the time till the doctor could\nbe there.",
        "Then out into the driving snow, urging the horse that\nknew by instinct that something was amiss, and so mile\nafter mile, till we rounded the corner into the single\nstreet of the silent village.",
        "Late, late at night it was–eleven o’clock, perhaps–and\nthe village dark and deep in sleep, except where the\nlight showed red against the blinds of the “Surgery” of\nthe doctor’s rough-cast house behind the spruce trees.",
        "“Doctor,” we cried, as we burst in, “hurry and come.\nJim’s ill–”",
        "I can see him still as he sat there in his surgery, the\nburly doctor, rugged and strong for all the sixty winters\nthat he carried. There he sat playing chess–always he\nseemed to be playing chess–with his son, a medical\nstudent, burly and rugged already as himself.",
        "“Shut the door, shut the door!” he called. “Come in,\nboys; here, let me brush that snow off you–it’s my move\nCharlie, remember–now, what the devil’s the matter?”",
        "Then we would pant out our hurried exclamations, both\ntogether.",
        "“Bah!” he growled, “ill nothing! Mere belly ache, I\nguess.”",
        "That was his term, his favorite word, for an undiagnosed\ndisease–\"belly ache.” They call it supergastral aesthesia\nnow. In a city house, it sounds better. Yet how we hung\nupon the doctor’s good old Saxon term, yearning and hoping\nthat it might be that.",
        "But even as he growled the doctor had taken down a lantern\nfrom a hook, thrown on a huge, battered fur coat that\ndoubled his size, and was putting medicines–a very\nshopful it seemed–into a leather case.",
        "“Your horse is done up,” he said. “We’ll put my mare in.\nCome and give me a hand, Charlie.”",
        "He was his own hostler and stable-man, he and his burly\nson. Yet how quickly and quietly he moved, the lantern\nswinging on his arm, as he buckled the straps. “What kind\nof a damn fool tug is this you’ve got?” he would say.",
        "Then, in a moment, as it seemed, out into the wind and\nsnow again, the great figure of the doctor almost filling\nthe seat of the cutter, the two of us crushed in beside\nhim, with responsibility, the unbearable burden, gone\nfrom us, and renewed comfort in our hearts.",
        "Little is said on the way: our heads are bent against\nthe storm: the long stride of the doctor’s mare eats up\nthe flying road.",
        "Then as we near the farm house and see the light in the\nsick-room window, fear clutches our hearts again.",
        "“You boys unhitch,” says the doctor. “I’ll go right in.”",
        "Presently, when we enter the house, we find that he is\nin the sick-room–the door closed. No word of comfort\nhas come forth. He has sent out for hot blankets. The\nstoves are to be kept burning. We must sit up. We may be\nneeded. That is all.",
        "And there in that still room through the long night, he\nfights single-handed against Death. Behind him is no\nhuman help, no consultation, no wisdom of the colleges\nto call in; only his own unaided strength, and his own\nfirm purpose and that strange instinct in the fight for\na flickering life, that some higher power than that of\ncolleges has planted deep within his soul.",
        "So we watch through the night hours, in dull misery and\nfear, a phantom at the window pane: so must we wait till\nthe slow morning shows dim and pale at the windows.",
        "Then he comes out from the room. His face is furrowed\nwith the fatigue of his long vigil. But as he speaks the\ntone of his voice is as that of one who has fought and\nconquered.",
        "“There–he’ll do now. Give him this when he wakes.”",
        "Then a great joy sweeps over us as the phantom flees\naway, and we shudder back into the warm sunshine of life,\nwhile the sound of the doctor’s retreating sleighbells\nmakes music to our ears.",
        "And once it was not so. The morning dawned and he did\nnot come from the darkened room: only there came to our\nlistening ears at times the sound of a sob or moan, and\nthe doctor’s voice, firm and low, but with all hope gone\nfrom it.",
        "And when at last he came, his face seemed old and sad as\nwe had never seen it. He paused a moment on the threshold\nand we heard him say, “I have done all that I can.” Then\nhe beckoned us into the darkened room, and, for the first\ntime, we knew Death.",
        "All that is forty years ago.",
        "They tell me that, since then, the practice of medicine\nhas been vastly improved. There are specialists now, I\nunderstand, for every conceivable illness and for every\nsubdivision of it. If I fall ill, there is a whole battery\nof modern science to be turned upon me in a moment. There\nare X-rays ready to penetrate me in all directions. I\nmay have any and every treatment–hypnotic, therapeutic\nor thaumaturgic–for which I am able to pay.",
        "But, oh, my friends, when it shall come to be my lot to\nbe ill and stricken–in the last and real sense, with\nthe Great Fear upon me, and the Dark Phantom at the\npane–then let some one go, fast and eager–though it be\nonly in the paths of an expiring memory–fast and eager,\nthrough the driving snow to bring him to my bedside. Let\nme hear the sound of his hurrying sleighbells as he comes,\nand his strong voice without the door–and, if that may\nnot be, then let me seem at least to feel the clasp of\nhis firm hand to guide me without fear to the Land of\nShadows, where he has gone before.",
