        "THE STORY OF JOSHUA OF NAZARETH, WHOM\nTHE GREEKS CALLED JESUS",
        "IN the autumn of the year of the city 783 (which would be\n62 A.D., in our way of counting time) AEsculapius Cultellus, a\nRoman physician, wrote to his nephew who was with the army\nin Syria as follows:",
        "My dear Nephew,",
        "A few days ago I was called in to prescribe for a sick man\nnamed Paul. He appeared to be a Roman citizen of Jewish\nparentage, well educated and of agreeable manners. I had\nbeen told that he was here in connection with a law-suit, an appeal\nfrom one of our provincial courts, Caesarea or some such\nplace in the eastern Mediterranean. He had been described to\nme as a “wild and violent” fellow who had been making\nspeeches against the People and against the Law. I found him\nvery intelligent and of great honesty.",
        "A friend of mine who used to be with the army in Asia\nMinor tells me that he heard something about him in Ephesus\nwhere he was preaching sermons about a strange new God. I\nasked my patient if this were true and whether he had told the\npeople to rebel against the will of our beloved Emperor. Paul\nanswered me that the Kingdom of which he had spoken was\nnot of this world and he added many strange utterances which\nI did not understand, but which were probably due to his\nfever.",
        "His personality made a great impression upon me and I\nwas sorry to hear that he was killed on the Ostian Road a few\ndays ago. Therefore I am writing this letter to you. When\nnext you visit Jerusalem, I want you to find out something\nabout my friend Paul and the strange Jewish prophet, who\nseems to have been his teacher. Our slaves are getting much\nexcited about this so-called Messiah, and a few of them, who\nopenly talked of the new kingdom (whatever that means) have\nbeen crucified. I would like to know the truth about all these\nrumours and I am\n                              Your devoted Uncle,\n                                   AESCULAPIUS CULTELLUS.",
        "Six weeks later, Gladius Ensa, the nephew, a captain of the\nVII Gallic Infantry, answered as follows:",
        "My dear Uncle,",
        "I received your letter and I have obeyed your instructions.",
        "Two weeks ago our brigade was sent to Jerusalem. There\nhave been several revolutions during the last century and there\nis not much left of the old city. We have been here now for a\nmonth and to-morrow we shall continue our march to Petra,\nwhere there has been trouble with some of the Arab tribes. I\nshall use this evening to answer your questions, but pray do\nnot expect a detailed report.",
        "I have talked with most of the older men in this city but\nfew have been able to give me any definite information. A\nfew days ago a pedler came to the camp. I bought some of\nhis olives and I asked him whether he had ever heard of the\nfamous Messiah who was killed when he was young. He said\nthat he remembered it very clearly, because his father had\ntaken him to Golgotha (a hill just outside the city) to see\nthe execution, and to show him what became of the enemies of\nthe laws of the people of Judaea. He gave me the address of\none Joseph, who had been a personal friend of the Messiah\nand told me that I had better go and see him if I wanted to\nknow more.",
        "This morning I went to call on Joseph. He was quite an\nold man. He had been a fisherman on one of the fresh-water\nlakes. His memory was clear, and from him at last I got a\nfairly definite account of what had happened during the\ntroublesome days before I was born.",
        "Tiberius, our great and glorious emperor, was on the throne,\nand an officer of the name of Pontius Pilatus was governor of\nJudaea and Samaria. Joseph knew little about this Pilatus.\nHe seemed to have been an honest enough official who left a\ndecent reputation as procurator of the province. In the year\n755 or 756 (Joseph had forgotten when) Pilatus was called to\nJerusalem on account of a riot. A certain young man (the\nson of a carpenter of Nazareth) was said to be planning a\nrevolution against the Roman government. Strangely enough\nour own intelligence officers, who are usually well informed,\nappear to have heard nothing about it, and when they investigated\nthe matter they reported that the carpenter was an\nexcellent citizen and that there was no reason to proceed against\nhim. But the old-fashioned leaders of the Jewish faith, according\nto Joseph, were much upset. They greatly disliked his\npopularity with the masses of the poorer Hebrews. The\n“Nazarene” (so they told Pilatus) had publicly claimed that a\nGreek or a Roman or even a Philistine, who tried to live a decent\nand honourable life, was quite as good as a Jew who spent\nhis days studying the ancient laws of Moses. Pilatus does not\nseem to have been impressed by this argument, but when the\ncrowds around the temple threatened to lynch Jesus, and kill\nall his followers, he decided to take the carpenter into custody\nto save his life.",
        "He does not appear to have understood the real nature of\nthe quarrel. Whenever he asked the Jewish priests to explain\ntheir grievances, they shouted “heresy” and “treason” and got\nterribly excited. Finally, so Joseph told me, Pilatus sent for\nJoshua (that was the name of the Nazarene, but the Greeks\nwho live in this part of the world always refer to him as Jesus)\nto examine him personally. He talked to him for several\nhours. He asked him about the “dangerous doctrines” which\nhe was said to have preached on the shores of the sea of Galilee.\nBut Jesus answered that he never referred to politics. He was\nnot so much interested in the bodies of men as in Man’s soul.\nHe wanted all people to regard their neighbours as their\nbrothers and to love one single God, who was the father of all\nliving beings.",
        "Pilatus, who seems to have been well versed in the doctrines\nof the Stoics and the other Greek philosophers, does not appear\nto have discovered anything seditious in the talk of Jesus.\nAccording to my informant he made another attempt to save\nthe life of the kindly prophet. He kept putting the execution\noff. Meanwhile the Jewish people, lashed into fury by their\npriests, got frantic with rage. There had been many riots in\nJerusalem before this and there were only a few Roman soldiers\nwithin calling distance. Reports were being sent to the\nRoman authorities in Caesarea that Pilatus had “fallen a victim\nto the teachings of the Nazarene.” Petitions were being\ncirculated all through the city to have Pilatus recalled, because\nhe was an enemy of the Emperor. You know that our governors\nhave strict instructions to avoid an open break with\ntheir foreign subjects. To save the country from civil war,\nPilatus finally sacrificed his prisoner, Joshua, who behaved\nwith great dignity and who forgave all those who hated him.\nHe was crucified amidst the howls and the laughter of the\nJerusalem mob.",
        "That is what Joseph told me, with tears running down his\nold cheeks. I gave him a gold piece when I left him, but he\nrefused it and asked me to hand it to one poorer than himself.\nI also asked him a few questions about your friend Paul. He\nhad known him slightly. He seems to have been a tent maker\nwho gave up his profession that he might preach the words of\na loving and forgiving God, who was so very different from\nthat Jehovah of whom the Jewish priests are telling us all\nthe time. Afterwards, Paul appears to have travelled much\nin Asia Minor and in Greece, telling the slaves that they were\nall children of one loving Father and that happiness awaits all,\nboth rich and poor, who have tried to live honest lives and have\ndone good to those who were suffering and miserable.",
        "I hope that I have answered your questions to your satisfaction.\nThe whole story seems very harmless to me as far as\nthe safety of the state is concerned. But then, we Romans\nnever have been able to understand the people of this province.\nI am sorry that they have killed your friend Paul. I wish that\nI were at home again, and I am, as ever,\n                         Your dutiful nephew,\n                                   GLADIUS ENSA.",
