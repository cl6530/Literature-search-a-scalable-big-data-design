        "The rest came to-morrow.  When the Antoine struck the sunken iceberg she\nwas not more than one hundred and twenty miles from the coast of Gaspe.\nShe had not struck it full on, or she would have crumpled up, but had\nstruck and glanced, mounting the berg, and sliding away with a small\ngaping wound in her side, broken internally where she had been weakest.\nHer condition was one of extreme danger, and the captain was by no means\nsure that he could make the land.  If a storm or a heavy sea came on,\nthey were doomed.",
        "As it was, with all hands at the pumps the water gained on her, and she\nmoaned and creaked and ached her way into the night with no surety that\nshe would show a funnel to the light of another day.  Passengers and crew\nalike worked, and the few boats were got ready to lower away when the\nworst should come to the worst.  Below, with the crew, the little\nmoneymaster of St. Saviour’s worked with an energy which had behind it\nsome generations of hardy qualities; and all the time he refused to be\ndowncast.  There was something in his nature or in his philosophy after\nall.  He had not much of a voice, but it was lusty and full of good\nfeeling; and when cursing began, when a sailor even dared to curse his\nbaptism–the crime of crimes to a Catholic mind–Jean Jacques began to\nsing a cheery song with which the habitants make vocal their labours or\ntheir playtimes:",
        "                   “A Saint-Malo, beau port de mer,\n                    Trois gros navir’s sont arrives,\n                    Trois gros navir’s sont arrives\n                    Charges d’avoin’, charges de ble.\n                    Charges d’avoin’, charges de ble:\n                    Trois dam’s s’en vont les marchander.”",
        "And so on through many verses, with a heartiness that was a good antidote\nto melancholy, even though it was no specific for a shipwreck.  It played\nits part, however; and when Jean Jacques finished it, he plunged into\nthat other outburst of the habitant’s gay spirits, ’Bal chez Boule’:",
        "              “Bal chez Boule, bal chez Boule,\n               The vespers o’er, we’ll away to that;\n               With our hearts so light, and our feet so gay,\n               We’ll dance to the tune of ’The Cardinal’s Hat’\n               The better the deed, the better the day\n               Bal chez Boule, bal chez Boule!”",
        "And while Jean Jacques worked “like a little French pony,” as they say in\nCanada of every man with the courage to do hard things in him, he did not\nstop to think that the scanty life-belts had all been taken, and that he\nwas a very poor swimmer indeed: for, as a child, he had been subject to\ncramp, and so had made the Beau Cheval River less his friend than would\nhave been useful now.",
        "He realized it, however, soon after daybreak, when, within a few hundred\nyards of the shores of Gaspe, to which the good Basque captain had been\nslowly driving the Antoine all night, there came the cry, “All\nhands on deck!” and “Lower the boats!” for the Antoine’s time had come,\nand within a hand-reach of shore almost she found the end of her rickety\nlife.  Not more than three-fourths of the passengers and crew were got\ninto the boats.  Jean Jacques was not one of these; but he saw Carmen\nDolores and her father safely bestowed, though in different boats.  To\nthe girl’s appeal to him to come he gave a nod of assent, and said he\nwould get in at the last moment; but this he did not do, pushing into the\nboat instead a crying lad of fifteen, who said he was afraid to die.",
        "So it was that Jean Jacques took to the water side by side with the\nBasque captain, when the Antoine groaned and shook, and then grew still,\nand presently, with some dignity, dipped her nose into the shallow sea\nand went down.",
        "“The rest of the story to-morrow,” Jean Jacques had said when the vessel\nstruck the iceberg the night before; and so it was.",
        "The boat in which Carmen had been placed was swamped not far from shore,\nbut she managed to lay hold of a piece of drifting wreckage, and began to\nfight steadily and easily landward.  Presently she was aware, however, of\na man struggling hard some little distance away to the left of her, and\nfrom the tousled hair shaking in the water she was sure that it was Jean\nJacques.",
        "So it proved to be; and thus it was that, at his last gasp almost, when\nhe felt he could keep up no longer, the wooden seat to which Carmen clung\ncame to his hand, and a word of cheer from her drew his head up with what\nwas almost a laugh.",
        "“To think of this!” he said presently when he was safe, with her\nswimming beside him without support, for the wooden seat would not\nsustain the weight of two.  “To think that it is you who saves me!” he\nagain declared eloquently, as they made the shore in comparative ease,\nfor she was a fine swimmer.",
        "“It is the rest of the story,” he said with great cheerfulness and aplomb\nas they stood on the shore in the morning sun, shoeless, coatless, but\nsafe: and she understood.",
        "There was nothing else for him to do.  The usual process of romance had\nbeen reversed.  He had not saved her life, she had saved his.  The least\nthat he could do was to give her shelter at the Manor Cartier yonder at\nSt. Saviour’s, her and, if need be, her father.  Human gratitude must\nhave play.  It was so strong in this case that it alone could have\novercome the Norman caution of Jean Jacques, and all his worldly wisdom\n(so much in his own eyes).  Added thereto was the thing which had been\ngreatly stirred in him at the instant the Antoine struck; and now he kept\npicturing Carmen in the big living-room and the big bedroom of the house\nby the mill, where was the comfortable four-poster which had come from\nthe mansion of the last Baron of Beaugard down by St. Laurent.",
        "Three days after the shipwreck of the Antoine, and as soon as sufficient\nfinery could be got in Quebec, it was accomplished, the fate of Jean\nJacques.  How proud he was to open his cheque-book before the young\nSpanish maid, and write in cramped, characteristic hand a cheque for a\nhundred dollars or so at a time!  A moiety of this money was given to\nSebastian Dolores, who could scarcely believe his good fortune.  A\nsituation was got for him by the help of a good abbe at Quebec, who was\ntouched by the tale of the wreck of the Antoine, and by the no less\nwonderful tale of the refugees of Spain, who naturally belonged to the\ntrue faith which “feared God and honoured the King.”  Sebastian Dolores\nwas grateful for the post offered him, though he would rather have gone\nto St. Saviour’s with his daughter, for he had lost the gift of work, and\nhe desired peace after war.  In other words, he had that fatal trait of\nthose who strive to make the world better by talk and violence, the vice\nof indolence.",
        "But when Jean Jacques and his handsome bride started for St. Saviour’s,\nthe new father-in-law did not despair of following soon.  He would\ngreatly have enjoyed the festivities which, after all, did follow the\nhome-coming of Jean Jacques Barbille and his Spanische; for while they\nlacked enthusiasm because Carmen was a foreigner, the romance of the\nstory gave the whole proceedings a spirit and interest which spread into\nadjoining parishes: so that people came to mass from forty miles away to\nsee the pair who had been saved from the sea.",
        "And when the Quebec newspapers found their way into the parish, with a\nthrilling account of the last hours of the Antoine; and of Jean Jacques’\nchivalrous act in refusing to enter a boat to save himself, though he was\nsuch a bad swimmer and was in danger of cramp; and how he sang Bal chez\nBoule while the men worked at the pumps; they permitted the apres noces\nof M’sieu’ and Madame Jean Jacques Barbille to be as brilliant as could\nbe, with the help of lively improvisation.  Even speech-making occurred\nagain in an address of welcome some days later.  This was followed by a\nfeast of Spanish cakes and meats made by the hands of Carmen Dolores,\n“the lady saved from the sea\"–as they called her; not knowing that she\nhad saved herself, and saved Jean Jacques as well.  It was not quite to\nJean Jacques’ credit that he did not set this error right, and tell the\nworld the whole exact truth.",
        "Air of certainty and universal comprehension\nAlways calling to something, for something outside ourselves\nCame of a race who set great store by mothers and grandmothers\nGrove of pines to give a sense of warmth in winter\nGrow more intense, more convinced, more thorough, as they talk\nHe admired, yet he wished to be admired\nInclined to resent his own insignificance\nLyrical in his enthusiasms\nNo man so simply sincere, or so extraordinarily prejudiced\nOf those who hypnotize themselves, who glow with self-creation\nSpurting out little geysers of other people’s cheap wisdom\nUntamed by the normal restraints of a happy married life",
