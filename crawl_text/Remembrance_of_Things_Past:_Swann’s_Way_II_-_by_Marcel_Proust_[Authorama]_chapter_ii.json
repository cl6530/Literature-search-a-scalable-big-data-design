        "To admit you to the ’little nucleus,’ the ’little group,’ the ’little\nclan’ at the Verdurins’, one condition sufficed, but that one was\nindispensable; you must give tacit adherence to a Creed one of whose\narticles was that the young pianist, whom Mme. Verdurin had taken under\nher patronage that year, and of whom she said “Really, it oughtn’t to be\nallowed, to play Wagner as well as that!” left both Planté and Rubinstein\n’sitting’; while Dr. Cottard was a more brilliant diagnostician than\nPotain. Each ’new recruit’ whom the Verdurins failed to persuade that the\nevenings spent by other people, in other houses than theirs, were as dull\nas ditch-water, saw himself banished forthwith. Women being in this\nrespect more rebellious than men, more reluctant to lay aside all worldly\ncuriosity and the desire to find out for themselves whether other\ndrawing-rooms might not sometimes be as entertaining, and the Verdurins\nfeeling, moreover, that this critical spirit and this demon of frivolity\nmight, by their contagion, prove fatal to the orthodoxy of the little\nchurch, they had been obliged to expel, one after another, all those of\nthe ’faithful’ who were of the female sex.",
        "Apart from the doctor’s young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively\nthat season (for all that Mme. Verdurin herself was a thoroughly ’good’\nwoman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich and\nwholly undistinguished, with which she had gradually and of her own accord\nsevered all connection) to a young woman almost of a ’certain class,’ a\nMme. de Crécy, whom Mme. Verdurin called by her Christian name, Odette,\nand pronounced a ’love,’ and to the pianist’s aunt, who looked as though\nshe had, at one period, ’answered the bell’: ladies quite ignorant of the\nworld, who in their social simplicity were so easily led to believe that\nthe Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay\nlarge sums of money to other poor wretches, in order to have anyone at\ntheir dinner-parties, that if somebody had offered to procure them an\ninvitation to the house of either of those great dames, the old doorkeeper\nand the woman of ’easy virtue’ would have contemptuously declined.",
        "The Verdurins never invited you to dinner; you had your ’place laid’\nthere. There was never any programme for the evening’s entertainment.  The\nyoung pianist would play, but only if he felt inclined, for no one was\nforced to do anything, and, as M. Verdurin used to say: “We’re all friends\nhere. Liberty Hall, you know!”",
        "If the pianist suggested playing the Ride of the Valkyries, or the Prelude\nto Tristan, Mme. Verdurin would protest, not that the music was\ndispleasing to her, but, on the contrary, that it made too violent an\nimpression.  “Then you want me to have one of my headaches? You know quite\nwell, it’s the same every time he plays that. I know what I’m in for.\nTomorrow, when I want to get up–nothing doing!” If he was not going to\nplay they talked, and one of the friends–usually the painter who was in\nfavour there that year–would “spin,” as M. Verdurin put it, “a damned\nfunny yarn that made ’em all split with laughter,” and especially Mme.\nVerdurin, for whom–so strong was her habit of taking literally the\nfigurative accounts of her emotions–Dr. Cottard, who was then just\nstarting in general practice, would “really have to come one day and set\nher jaw, which she had dislocated with laughing too much.”",
        "Evening dress was barred, because you were all ’good pals,’ and didn’t\nwant to look like the ’boring people’ who were to be avoided like the\nplague, and only asked to the big evenings, which were given as seldom as\npossible, and then only if it would amuse the painter or make the musician\nbetter known. The rest of the time you were quite happy playing charades\nand having supper in fancy dress, and there was no need to mingle any\nstrange element with the little ’clan.’",
        "But just as the ’good pals’ came to take a more and more prominent place\nin Mme. Verdurin’s life, so the ’bores,’ the ’nuisances’ grew to include\neverybody and everything that kept her friends away from her, that made\nthem sometimes plead ’previous engagements,’ the mother of one, the\nprofessional duties of another, the ’little place in the country’ of a\nthird. If Dr. Cottard felt bound to say good night as soon as they rose\nfrom table, so as to go back to some patient who was seriously ill; “I\ndon’t know,” Mme. Verdurin would say, “I’m sure it will do him far more\ngood if you don’t go disturbing him again this evening; he will have a\ngood night without you; to-morrow morning you can go round early and you\nwill find him cured.” From the beginning of December it would make her\nquite ill to think that the ’faithful’ might fail her on Christmas and New\nYear’s Days. The pianist’s aunt insisted that he must accompany her, on\nthe latter, to a family dinner at her mother’s.",
        "“You don’t suppose she’ll die, your mother,” exclaimed Mme. Verdurin\nbitterly, “if you don’t have dinner with her on New Year’s Day, like\npeople in the provinces!”",
        "Her uneasiness was kindled again in Holy Week: “Now you, Doctor, you’re a\nsensible, broad-minded man; you’ll come, of course, on Good Friday, just\nlike any other day?” she said to Cottard in the first year of the little\n’nucleus,’ in a loud and confident voice, as though there could be no\ndoubt of his answer. But she trembled as she waited for it, for if he did\nnot come she might find herself condemned to dine alone.",
        "“I shall come on Good Friday–to say good-bye to you, for we are going to\nspend the holidays in Auvergne.”",
        "“In Auvergne? To be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures! A fine lot\nof good that will do you!” And after a solemn pause: “If you had only told\nus, we would have tried to get up a party, and all gone there together,\ncomfortably.”",
        "And so, too, if one of the ’faithful’ had a friend, or one of the ladies a\nyoung man, who was liable, now and then, to make them miss an evening, the\nVerdurins, who were not in the least afraid of a woman’s having a lover,\nprovided that she had him in their company, loved him in their company and\ndid not prefer him to their company, would say: “Very well, then, bring\nyour friend along.” And he would be put to the test, to see whether he was\nwilling to have no secrets from Mme. Verdurin, whether he was susceptible\nof being enrolled in the ’little clan.’ If he failed to pass, the faithful\none who had introduced him would be taken on one side, and would be\ntactfully assisted to quarrel with the friend or mistress. But if the test\nproved satisfactory, the newcomer would in turn be numbered among the\n’faithful.’ And so when, in the course of this same year, the courtesan\ntold M. Verdurin that she had made the acquaintance of such a charming\ngentleman, M. Swann, and hinted that he would very much like to be allowed\nto come, M. Verdurin carried the request at once to his wife. He never\nformed an opinion on any subject until she had formed hers, his special\nduty being to carry out her wishes and those of the ’faithful’ generally,\nwhich he did with boundless ingenuity.",
        "“My dear, Mme. de Crécy has something to say to you. She would like to\nbring one of her friends here, a M. Swann. What do you say?”",
        "“Why, as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of perfection\nlike that. Be quiet; no one asked your opinion. I tell you that you are a\npiece of perfection.”",
        "“Just as you like,” replied Odette, in an affected tone, and then went on:\n\"You know I’m not fishing for compliments.”",
        "“Very well; bring your friend, if he’s nice.”",
        "Now there was no connection whatsoever between the ’little nucleus’ and\nthe society which Swann frequented, and a purely worldly man would have\nthought it hardly worth his while, when occupying so exceptional a\nposition in the world, to seek an introduction to the Verdurins. But Swann\nwas so ardent a lover that, once he had got to know almost all the women\nof the aristocracy, once they had taught him all that there was to learn,\nhe had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers, almost a patent of\nnobility, which the Faubourg Saint-Germain had bestowed upon him, save as\na sort of negotiable bond, a letter of credit with no intrinsic value,\nwhich allowed him to improvise a status for himself in some little hole in\nthe country, or in some obscure quarter of Paris, where the good-looking\ndaughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken his fancy. For at such\ntimes desire, or love itself, would revive in him a feeling of vanity from\nwhich he was now quite free in his everyday life, although it was, no\ndoubt, the same feeling which had originally prompted him towards that\ncareer as a man of fashion in which he had squandered his intellectual\ngifts upon frivolous amusements, and had made use of his erudition in\nmatters of art only to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how\nto decorate their houses; and this vanity it was which made him eager to\nshine, in the sight of any fair unknown who had captivated him for the\nmoment, with a brilliance which the name of Swann by itself did not emit.\nAnd he was most eager when the fair unknown was in humble circumstances.\nJust as it is not by other men of intelligence that an intelligent man is\nafraid of being thought a fool, so it is not by the great gentleman but by\nboors and ’bounders’ that a man of fashion is afraid of finding his social\nvalue underrated. Three-fourths of the mental ingenuity displayed, of the\nsocial falsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people\nwhose importance they have served only to diminish, have been aimed at\ninferiors. And Swann, who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when\nwith a duchess, would tremble^ for fear of being despised, and would\ninstantly begin to pose, were he to meet her grace’s maid.",
        "Unlike so many people, who, either from lack of energy or else from a\nresigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur\nto remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the\nstream of life, abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them above\nand below that point, that degree in life in which they will remain fixed\nuntil the day of their death, and are content, in the end, to describe as\npleasures, for want of any better, those mediocre distractions, that just\nnot intolerable tedium which is enclosed there with them; Swann would\nendeavour not to find charm and beauty in the women with whom he must pass\ntime, but to pass his time among women whom he had already found to be\nbeautiful and charming. And these were, as often as not, women whose\nbeauty was of a distinctly ’common’ type, for the physical qualities which\nattracted him instinctively, and without reason, were the direct opposite\nof those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his\nfavourite masters. Depth of character, or a melancholy expression on a\nwoman’s face would freeze his senses, which would, however, immediately\nmelt at the sight of healthy, abundant, rosy human flesh.",
        "If on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct for\nhim to make no attempt to know, but among whom a woman caught his eye,\nadorned with a special charm that was new to him, to remain on his ’high\nhorse’ and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him, to substitute\na pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in her company\nby writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come and join him,\nwould have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the face of life, as\nstupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if, instead of\nvisiting the country where he was, he had shut himself up in his own rooms\nand looked at ’views’ of Paris. He did not immure himself in the solid\nstructure of his social relations, but had made of them, so as to be able\nto set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman might take his\nfancy, one of those collapsible tents which explorers carry about with\nthem. Any part of it which was not portable or could not be adapted to\nsome fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless, however enviable it\nmight appear to others. How often had his credit with a duchess, built up\nof the yearly accumulation of her desire to do him some favour for which\nshe had never found an opportunity, been squandered in a moment by his\ncalling upon her, in an indiscreetly worded message, for a recommendation\nby telegraph which would put him in touch at once with one of her agents\nwhose daughter he had noticed in the country, just as a starving man might\nbarter a diamond for a crust of bread. Indeed, when it was too late, he\nwould laugh at himself for it, for there was in his nature, redeemed by\nmany rare refinements, an element of clownishness. Then he belonged to\nthat class of intelligent men who have led a life of idleness, and who\nseek consolation and, perhaps, an excuse in the idea, which their idleness\noffers to their intelligence, of objects as worthy of their interest as\nany that could be attained by art or learning, the idea that ’Life’\ncontains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the\nromances ever written. So, at least, he would assure and had no difficulty\nin persuading the more subtle among his friends in the fashionable world,\nnotably the Baron de Charlus, whom he liked to amuse with stories of the\nstartling adventures that had befallen him, such as when he had met a\nwoman in the train, and had taken her home with him, before discovering\nthat she was the sister of a reigning monarch, in whose hands were\ngathered, at that moment, all the threads of European politics, of which\nhe found himself kept informed in the most delightful fashion, or when, in\nthe complexity of circumstances, it depended upon the choice which the\nConclave was about to make whether he might or might not become the lover\nof somebody’s cook.",
        "It was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals and\nacademicians, to whom he was bound by such close ties, that Swann\ncompelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders. All his friends\nwere accustomed to receive, from time to time, letters which called on\nthem for a word of recommendation or introduction, with a diplomatic\nadroitness which, persisting throughout all his successive ’affairs’ and\nusing different pretexts, revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest\nindiscretion, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest. I\nused often to recall to myself when, many years later, I began to take an\ninterest in his character because of the similarities which, in wholly\ndifferent respects, it offered to my own, how, when he used to write to my\ngrandfather (though not at the time we are now considering, for it was\nabout the date of my own birth that Swann’s great ’affair’ began, and made\na long interruption in his amatory practices) the latter, recognising his\nfriend’s handwriting on the envelope, would exclaim: “Here is Swann asking\nfor something; on guard!” And, either from distrust or from the\nunconscious spirit of devilry which urges us to offer a thing only to\nthose who do not want it, my grandparents would meet with an obstinate\nrefusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers, as when he begged them\nfor an introduction to a girl who dined with us every Sunday, and whom\nthey were obliged, whenever Swann mentioned her, to pretend that they no\nlonger saw, although they would be wondering, all through the week, whom\nthey could invite to meet her, and often failed, in the end, to find\nanyone, sooner than make a sign to him who would so gladly have accepted.",
        "Occasionally a couple of my grandparents’ acquaintance, who had been\ncomplaining for some time that they never saw Swann now, would announce\nwith satisfaction, and perhaps with a slight inclination to make my\ngrandparents envious of them, that he had suddenly become as charming as\nhe could possibly be, and was never out of their house. My grandfather\nwould not care to shatter their pleasant illusion, but would look at my\ngrandmother, as he hummed the air of:",
        "  What is this mystery?\n  I cannot understand it;",
        "or of:",
        "  Vision fugitive...;\n  In matters such as this\n  ’Tis best to close one’s eyes.",
        "A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann’s new friend “What about\nSwann? Do you still see as much of him as ever?” the other’s face would\nlengthen: “Never mention his name to me again!”",
        "“But I thought that you were such friends...”",
        "He had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins of\nmy grandmother, dining almost every evening at their house. Suddenly, and\nwithout any warning, he ceased to appear. They supposed him to be ill, and\nthe lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him when, in her\nkitchen, she found a letter in his hand, which her cook had left by\naccident in the housekeeping book. In this he announced that he was\nleaving Paris and would not be able to come to the house again. The cook\nhad been his mistress, and at the moment of breaking off relations she was\nthe only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary to inform.",
        "But when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society, or at\nleast one whose birth was not so lowly, nor her position so irregular that\nhe was unable to arrange for her reception in ’society,’ then for her sake\nhe would return to it, but only to the particular orbit in which she moved\nor into which he had drawn her. “No good depending on Swann for this\nevening,” people would say; “don’t you remember, it’s his American’s night\nat the Opera?” He would secure invitations for her to the most exclusive\ndrawing-rooms, to those houses where he himself went regularly, for weekly\ndinners or for poker; every evening, after a slight ’wave’ imparted to his\nstiffly brushed red locks had tempered with a certain softness the ardour\nof his bold green eyes, he would select a flower for his buttonhole and\nset out to meet his mistress at the house of one or other of the women of\nhis circle; and then, thinking of the affection and admiration which the\nfashionable folk, whom he always treated exactly as he pleased, would,\nwhen he met them there, lavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom\nhe loved, he would find a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which\nhe had grown weary, but whose substance, pervaded and warmly coloured by\nthe flickering light which he had slipped into its midst, seemed to him\nbeautiful and rare, now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love.",
        "But while each of these attachments, each of these flirtations had been\nthe realisation, more or less complete, of a dream born of the sight of a\nface or a form which Swann had spontaneously, and without effort on his\npart, found charming, it was quite another matter when, one day at the\ntheatre, he was introduced to Odette de Crécy by an old friend of his own,\nwho had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom he might\nvery possibly come to an understanding; but had made her out to be harder\nof conquest than she actually was, so as to appear to be conferring a\nspecial favour by the introduction. She had struck Swann not, certainly,\nas being devoid of beauty, but as endowed with a style of beauty which\nleft him indifferent, which aroused in him no desire, which gave him,\nindeed, a sort of physical repulsion; as one of those women of whom every\nman can name some, and each will name different examples, who are the\nconverse of the type which our senses demand. To give him any pleasure her\nprofile was too sharp, her skin too delicate, her cheek-bones too\nprominent, her features too tightly drawn. Her eyes were fine, but so\nlarge that they seemed to be bending beneath their own weight, strained\nthe rest of her face and always made her appear unwell or in an ill\nhumour. Some time after this introduction at the theatre she had written\nto ask Swann whether she might see his collections, which would interest\nher so much, she, “an ignorant woman with a taste for beautiful things,\"\nsaying that she would know him better when once she had seen him in his\n’home,’ where she imagined him to be “so comfortable with his tea and his\nbooks\"; although she had not concealed her surprise at his being in that\npart of the town, which must be so depressing, and was “not nearly smart\nenough for such a very smart man.” And when he allowed her to come she had\nsaid to him as she left how sorry she was to have stayed so short a time\nin a house into which she was so glad to have found her way at last,\nspeaking of him as though he had meant something more to her than the rest\nof the people she knew, and appearing to unite their two selves with a\nkind of romantic bond which had made him smile. But at the time of life,\ntinged already with disenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a\nman can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving\nwithout expecting too much in return, this linking of hearts, if it is no\nlonger, as in early youth, the goal towards which love, of necessity,\ntends, still is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it\nmay well become the cause of love if it presents itself first. In his\nyounger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he\nloves; later, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be\nenough to make him fall in love with her. And 50, at an age when it would\nappear–since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective\npleasure–that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part in\nits procreation, love may come into being, love of the most physical\norder, without any foundation in desire.  At this time of life a man has\nalready been wounded more than once by the darts of love; it no longer\nevolves by itself, obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws, before\nhis passive and astonished heart. We come to its aid; we falsify it by\nmemory and by suggestion; recognising one of its symptoms we recall and\nrecreate the rest. Since we possess its hymn, engraved on our hearts in\nits entirety, there is no need of any woman to repeat the opening lines,\npotent with the admiration which her beauty inspires, for us to remember\nall that follows. And if she begin in the middle, where it sings of our\nexisting, henceforward, for one another only, we are well enough attuned\nto that music to be able to take it up and follow our partner, without\nhesitation, at the first pause in her voice.",
        "Odette de Crécy came again to see Swann; her visits grew more frequent,\nand doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he felt\nat the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in the\ninterval, not remembering it as either so expressive or, in spite of her\nyouth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to him, that her\nreally considerable beauty was not of the kind which he spontaneously\nadmired.  It must be remarked that Odette’s face appeared thinner and more\nprominent than it actually was, because her forehead and the upper part of\nher cheeks, a single and almost plane surface, were covered by the masses\nof hair which women wore at that period, drawn forward in a fringe, raised\nin crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears; while as for\nher figure, and she was admirably built, it was impossible to make out its\ncontinuity (on account of the fashion then prevailing, and in spite of her\nbeing one of the best-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting\nforwards in an arch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a\nsharp point, beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts,\ngave a woman, that year, the appearance of being composed of different\nsections badly fitted together; to such an extent did the frills, the\nflounces, the inner bodice follow, in complete independence, controlled\nonly by the fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material, the\nline which led them to the knots of ribbon, falls of lace, fringes of\nvertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere\nattached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the\narchitecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her own,\nfound herself either strait-laced to suffocation or else completely\nburied.",
        "But, after Odette had left him, Swann would think with a smile of her\ntelling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again; he\nremembered the anxious, timid way in which she had once begged him that it\nmight not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at him then,\nfixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her a touching\nair beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in the front of her\nround bonnet of white straw, tied with strings of black velvet. “And won’t\nyou,” she had ventured, “come just once and take tea with me?” He had\npleaded pressure of work, an essay–which, in reality, he had abandoned\nyears ago–on Vermeer of Delft. “I know that I am quite useless,” she had\nreplied, “a little wild thing like me beside a learned great man like you.\nI should be like the frog in the fable! And yet I should so much like to\nlearn, to know things, to be initiated. What fun it would be to become a\nregular bookworm, to bury my nose in a lot of old papers!” she had gone\non, with that self-satisfied air which a smart woman adopts when she\ninsists that her one desire is to give herself up, without fear of soiling\nher fingers, to some unclean task, such as cooking the dinner, with her\n\"hands right in the dish itself.” “You will only laugh at me, but this\npainter who stops you from seeing me,” she meant Vermeer, “I have never\neven heard of him; is he alive still? Can I see any of his things in\nParis, so as to have some idea of what is going on behind that great brow\nwhich works so hard, that head which I feel sure is always puzzling away\nabout things; just to be able to say ’There, that’s what he’s thinking\nabout!’ What a dream it would be to be able to help you with your work.”",
        "He had sought an excuse in his fear of forming new friendships, which he\ngallantly described as his fear of a hopeless passion. “You are afraid of\nfalling in love? How funny that is, when I go about seeking nothing else,\nand would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere!” she had said,\nso naturally and with such an air of conviction that he had been genuinely\ntouched. “Some woman must have made you suffer. And you think that the rest\nare all like her. She can’t have understood you: you are so utterly\ndifferent from ordinary men. That’s what I liked about you when I first\nsaw you; I felt at once that you weren’t like everybody else.”",
        "“And then, besides, there’s yourself––” he had continued, “I know what\nwomen are; you must have a whole heap of things to do, and never any time\nto spare.”",
        "“I? Why, I have never anything to do. I am always free, and I always will\nbe free if you want me. At whatever hour of the day or night it may suit\nyou to see me, just send for me, and I shall be only too delighted to\ncome. Will you do that? Do you know what I should really like–to\nintroduce you to Mme. Verdurin, where I go every evening. Just fancy my\nfinding you there, and thinking that it was a little for my sake that you\nhad gone.”",
        "No doubt, in thus remembering their conversations, in thinking about her\nthus when he was alone, he did no more than call her image into being\namong those of countless other women in his romantic dreams; but if,\nthanks to some accidental circumstance (or even perhaps without that\nassistance, for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment when\na mental state, hitherto latent, makes itself felt, may well have had no\ninfluence whatsoever upon that state), the image of Odette de Crécy came\nto absorb the whole of his dreams, if from those dreams the memory of her\ncould no longer be eliminated, then her bodily imperfections would no\nlonger be of the least importance, nor would the conformity of her body,\nmore or less than any other, to the requirements of Swann’s taste; since,\nhaving become the body of her whom he loved, it must henceforth be the\nonly one capable of causing him joy or anguish.",
        "It so happened that my grandfather had known–which was more than could be\nsaid of any other actual acquaintance–the family of these Verdurins.\nBut he had entirely severed his connection with what he called “young\nVerdurin,” taking a general view of him as one who had fallen–though\nwithout losing hold of his millions–among the riff-raff of Bohemia.  One\nday he received a letter from Swann asking whether my grandfather could\nput him in touch with the Verdurins. “On guard! on guard!” he exclaimed as\nhe read it, “I am not at all surprised; Swann was bound to finish up like\nthis. A nice lot of people! I cannot do what he asks, because, in the\nfirst place, I no longer know the gentleman in question. Besides, there\nmust be a woman in it somewhere, and I don’t mix myself up in such\nmatters.  Ah, well, we shall see some fun if Swann begins running after\nthe little Verdurins.”",
        "And on my grandfather’s refusal to act as sponsor, it was Odette herself\nwho had taken Swann to the house.",
        "The Verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when Swann made his\nfirst appearance, Dr. and Mme. Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt,\nand the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course of\nthe evening, by several more of the ’faithful.’",
        "Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply\nto any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest.  And\nso in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the\noffer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would\nexonerate him from the charge of being a simpleton, if the remark\naddressed to him should turn out to have been facetious. But as he must\nalso be prepared to face the alternative, he never dared to allow this\nsmile a definite expression on his features, and you would see there a\nperpetually flickering uncertainty, in which you might decipher the\nquestion that he never dared to ask: “Do you really mean that?” He was no\nmore confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the\nstreet, or indeed in life generally, than he was in a drawing-room; and he\nmight be seen greeting passers-by, carriages, and anything that occurred\nwith a malicious smile which absolved his subsequent behaviour of all\nimpropriety, since it proved, if it should turn out unsuited to the\noccasion, that he was well aware of that, and that if he had assumed a\nsmile, the jest was a secret of his own.",
        "On all those points, however, where a plain question appeared to him to be\npermissible, the Doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate the\nwilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his\neducation.",
        "So it was that, following the advice given him by a wise mother on his\nfirst coming up to the capital from his provincial home, he would never\nlet pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him\nwithout an effort to secure the fullest information upon it.",
        "As regards figures of speech, he was insatiable in his thirst for\nknowledge, for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than\nwas actually the case, he would want to know what, exactly, was intended\nby those which he most frequently heard used: ’devilish pretty,’ ’blue\nblood,’ ’a cat and dog life,’ ’a day of reckoning,’ ’a queen of\nfashion, ’to give a free hand,’ ’to be at a deadlock,’ and so forth; and\nin what particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in\nconversation. Failing these, he would adorn it with puns and other ’plays\nupon words’ which he had learned by rote. As for the names of strangers\nwhich were uttered in his hearing, he used merely to repeat them to\nhimself in a questioning tone, which, he thought, would suffice to furnish\nhim with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek.",
        "As the critical faculty, on the universal application of which he prided\nhimself, was, in reality, completely lacking, that refinement of good\nbreeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in any\nway, without expecting to be believed, that it is really yourself that is\nobliged to him, was wasted on Cottard, who took everything that he heard\nin its literal sense. However blind she may have been to his faults, Mme.\nVerdurin was genuinely annoyed, though she still continued to regard him\nas brilliantly clever, when, after she had invited him to see and hear\nSarah Bernhardt from a stage box, and had said politely: “It is very good\nof you to have come, Doctor, especially as I’m sure you must often have\nheard Sarah Bernhardt; and besides, I’m afraid we’re rather too near the\nstage,” the Doctor, who had come into the box with a smile which waited\nbefore settling upon or vanishing from his face until some one in\nauthority should enlighten him as to the merits of the spectacle, replied:\n\"To be sure, we are far too near the stage, and one is getting sick of\nSarah Bernhardt. But you expressed a wish that I should come. For me, your\nwish is a command.  I am only too glad to be able to do you this little\nservice. What would one not do to please you, you are so good.” And he\nwent on, “Sarah Bernhardt; that’s what they call the Voice of God, ain’t\nit? You see, often, too, that she ’sets the boards on fire.’ That’s an odd\nexpression, ain’t it?” in the hope of an enlightening commentary, which,\nhowever, was not forthcoming.",
        "“D’you know,” Mme. Verdurin had said to her husband, “I believe we are\ngoing the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the\nDoctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday\nexistence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he\naccepts everything that we say as gospel.”",
        "“I never dared to mention it,” M. Verdurin had answered, “but I’ve noticed\nthe same thing myself.” And on the following New Year’s Day, instead of\nsending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs, and pretending\nthat it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an artificial stone for\nthree hundred, and let it be understood that it was something almost\nimpossible to match.",
        "When Mme. Verdurin had announced that they were to see M. Swann that\nevening; “Swann!” the Doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal by\nhis astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take utterly\nunawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in readiness for\nanything. And seeing that no one answered him, “Swann! Who on earth is\nSwann?” he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as Mme.\nVerdurin had explained, “Why, Odette’s friend, whom she told us about.”",
        "“Ah, good, good; that’s all right, then,” answered the Doctor, at once\nmollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of Swann’s\nappearing at the Verdurins’, because he supposed him to be in love with\nOdette, and was always ready to assist at lovers’ meetings. “Nothing\namuses me more than match-making,” he confided to Cottard; “I have been\ntremendously successful, even with women!”",
        "In telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely ’smart,’ Odette had\nalarmed them with the prospect of another ’bore.’ When he arrived,\nhowever, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which,\nthough they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society. He\nhad, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in\nthe world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and refinement, who\nhave never gone into society, namely that they no longer see it\ntransfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the\nimagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature, freed\nfrom all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly,\ngrown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of movement of a\ntrained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the\nmovement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of\nhis body. The simple and elementary gestures used by a man of the world\nwhen he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown youth who is being\nintroduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before the Ambassador to\nwhom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded, without his being\nconscious of it, the whole of Swann’s social deportment, so that in the\ncompany of people of a lower grade than his own, such as the Verdurins and\ntheir friends, he instinctively shewed an assiduity, and made overtures\nwith which, by their account, any of their ’bores’ would have dispensed.\nHe chilled, though for a moment only, on meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing\nhim close one eye with an ambiguous smile, before they had yet spoken to\none another (a grimace which Cottard styled “letting ’em all come”), Swann\nsupposed that the Doctor recognised him from having met him already\nsomewhere, probably in some house of ’ill-fame,’ though these he himself\nvery rarely visited, never having made a habit of indulging in the\nmercenary sort of love. Regarding such an allusion as in bad taste,\nespecially before Odette, whose opinion of himself it might easily alter\nfor the worse, Swann assumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that\nthe lady next to the Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a\nhusband would not deliberately, in his wife’s hearing, have made any\nallusion to amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the\nDoctor’s expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The\npainter at once invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann\nfound him very pleasant. “Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I\nhave been,” Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour,\n\"perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard’s portrait” (for which she had\ngiven the painter a commission).  “Take care, Master Biche,” she reminded\nthe painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address as\n’Master,’ “to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little twinkle.\nYou know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that’s what I’ve\nasked you to paint–the portrait of his smile.” And since the phrase\nstruck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to make sure\nthat as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and even made use\nof some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it\nagain. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone, even to an old friend of\nthe Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness, simplicity and good-nature\nhad deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in\npalaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished family to which he\nbelonged. When he spoke, his words came with a confusion which was\ndelightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect\nin his speech as a quality of his soul, as it were a survival from the age\nof innocence which he had never wholly outgrown. All the cop-sonants which\nhe did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his\ngentle lips were incapable. By asking to be made known to M. Saniette,\nSwann made M. Verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction (saying, in\nfact, with emphasis on the distinction: “M. Swann, pray let me present to\nyou our friend Saniette”) but he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of\ngratitude, which, however, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since\nSaniette rather annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him\nwith friends. On the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by\nSwann’s next request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the\npianist’s aunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for\nshe believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing\ncould be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as it\nalways was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with deference,\nbut drew herself up again with great dignity.  As she was entirely\nuneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and\npronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling\nmanner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in\nthe surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had\nactually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of\ncontinuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare\nintervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive. Swann\nsupposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation\nwith M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused.",
        "“She is such an excellent woman!” he rejoined. “I grant you that she is\nnot exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most charmingly\nwhen you are alone with her.”",
        "“I am sure she can,” Swann hastened to conciliate him. “All I meant was\nthat she hardly struck me as ’distinguished,’” he went on, isolating the\nepithet in the inverted commas of his tone, “and, after all, that is\nsomething of a compliment.”",
        "“Wait a moment,” said M. Verdurin, “now, this will surprise you; she\nwrites quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is\nadmirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something, M.\nSwann?”",
        "“I should count myself most fortunate...” Swann was beginning, a trifle\npompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it said,\nand never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the\nuse of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a solemn\nword used seriously, as the word ’fortunate’ had been used just now by\nSwann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately\npedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in what\nhe called an old ’tag’ or ’saw,’ however common it might still be in\ncurrent usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing\nwas a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation,\nwhich he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at\nthat point, although in reality it had never entered his mind.",
        "“Most fortunate for France!” he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms\nwith great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing.",
        "“What are all those good people laughing at over there? There’s no sign of\nbrooding melancholy down in your corner,” shouted Mme. Verdurin.  “You\ndon’t suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the\nstool of repentance,” she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child.",
        "Mme. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood,\nwhich a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in\nher drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school ’form,’ and\n’swore,’ as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture which she\nhad besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which\nher ’faithful’ were in the habit of making her from time to time, so that\nthe donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to\nthe house. She tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers\nand sweets, which had at least the merit of mortality; but she was never\nsuccessful, and the house was gradually filled with a collection of\nfoot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens, barometers and vases, a constant\nrepetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible\nobjects.",
        "From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation\nof the ’faithful,’ and would revel in all their fun; but, since the\naccident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in real\nhilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which\nsignified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that she\nwas ’laughing until she cried.’ At the least witticism aimed by any of the\ncircle against a ’bore,’ or against a former member of the circle who was\nnow relegated to the limbo of ’bores’–and to the utter despair of M.\nVerdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his\nwife, but who, since his laughter was the ’real thing,’ was out of breath\nin a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a\nfeigned but continuous hilarity–she would utter a shrill cry, shut tight\nher little bird-like eyes, which were beginning to be clouded over by a\ncataract, and quickly, as though she had only just time to avoid some\nindecent sight or to parry a mortal blow, burying her face in her hands,\nwhich completely engulfed it, and prevented her from seeing anything at\nall, she would appear to be struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh\nwhich, were she to give way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate.\nSo, stupefied with the gaiety of the ’faithful,’ drunken with comradeship,\nscandal and asseveration, Mme.  Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a\ncage-bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft\nand sob with fellow-feeling.",
        "Meanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann’s permission to light his\npipe (\"No ceremony here, you understand; we’re all pals!”), went and\nbegged the young musician to sit down at the piano.",
        "“Leave him alone; don’t bother him; he hasn’t come here to be tormented,\"\ncried Mme. Verdurin. “I won’t have him tormented.”",
        "“But why on earth should it bother him?” rejoined M. Verdurin. “I’m sure\nM. Swann has never heard the sonata in F sharp which we discovered; he is\ngoing to play us the pianoforte arrangement.”",
        "“No, no, no, not my sonata!” she screamed, “I don’t want to be made to cry\nuntil I get a cold in the head, and neuralgia all down my face, like last\ntime; thanks very much, I don’t intend to repeat that performance; you are\nall very kind and considerate; it is easy to see that none of you will\nhave to stay in bed, for a week.”",
        "This little scene, which was re-enacted as often as the young pianist sat\ndown to play, never failed to delight the audience, as though each of them\nwere witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the seductive\noriginality of the ’Mistress’ as she was styled, and of the acute\nsensitiveness of her musical ’ear.’ Those nearest to her would attract the\nattention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at the other end\nof the room, by their cries of ’Hear, hear!’ which, as in Parliamentary\ndebates, shewed that something worth listening to was being said. And next\nday they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming\nthat evening, and would assure them that the ’little scene’ had never been\nso amusingly done.",
        "“Well, all right, then,” said M. Verdurin, “he can play just the andante.”",
        "“Just the andante! How you do go on,” cried his wife. “As if it weren’t\n’just the andante’ that breaks every bone in my body. The ’Master’ is\nreally too priceless! Just as though, ’in the Ninth,’ he said ’we need\nonly have the finale,’ or ’just the overture’ of the Meistersinger.”",
        "The Doctor, however, urged Mme. Verdurin to let the pianist play, not\nbecause he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the\ndistressing effects that music always had upon her, for he recognised the\nexistence of certain neurasthenic states–but from his habit, common to\nmany doctors, of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as\nsoon as it appeared to jeopardise, what seemed to him far more important,\nthe success of some social gathering at which he was present, and of which\nthe patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache\nformed an essential factor.",
        "“You won’t be ill this time, you’ll find,” he told her, seeking at the\nsame time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze. “And, if you\nare ill, we will cure you.”",
        "“Will you, really?” Mme. Verdurin spoke as though, with so great a favour\nin store for her, there was nothing for it but to capitulate. Perhaps,\ntoo, by dint of saying that she was going to be ill, she had worked\nherself into a state in which she forgot, occasionally, that it was all\nonly a ’little scene,’ and regarded things, quite sincerely, from an\ninvalid’s point of view.  For it may often be remarked that invalids grow\nweary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own\nprudence in avoiding them, and like to let themselves think that they are\nfree to do everything that they most enjoy doing, although they are always\nill after doing it, provided only that they place themselves in the hands\nof a higher authority which, without putting them to the least\ninconvenience, can and will, by uttering a word or by administering a\ntabloid, set them once again upon their feet.",
        "Odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying\nto Mme. Verdurin, “I have my own little corner, haven’t I?”",
        "And Mme. Verdurin, seeing Swann by himself upon a chair, made him get up.\n\"You’re not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by Odette; you can\nmake room for M. Swann there, can’t you, Odette?”",
        "“What charming Beauvais!” said Swann, stopping to admire the sofa before\nhe sat down on it, and wishing to be polite.",
        "“I am glad you appreciate my sofa,” replied Mme. Verdurin, “and I warn you\nthat if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the\nidea at once. They never made any more like it. And these little chairs,\ntoo, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a moment.  The emblems\nin each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry\non the chair; you know, you combine amusement with instruction when you\nlook at them;–I can promise you a delightful time, I assure you. Just\nlook at the little border around the edges; here, look, the little vine on\na red background in this one, the Bear and the Grapes. Isn’t it well\ndrawn? What do you say? I think they knew a thing or two about design!\nDoesn’t it make your mouth water, this vine? My husband makes out that I\nam not fond of fruit, because I eat less than he does. But not a bit of\nit, I am greedier than any of you, but I have no need to fill my mouth\nwith them when I can feed on them with my eyes.  What are you all laughing\nat now, pray? Ask the Doctor; he will tell you that those grapes act on me\nlike a regular purge. Some people go to Fontainebleau for cures; I take my\nown little Beauvais cure here. But, M. Swann, you mustn’t run away without\nfeeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs. Isn’t it an exquisite\nsurface? No, no, not with your whole hand like that; feel them property!”",
        "“If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,” said\nthe painter, “we shan’t get any music to-night.”",
        "“Be quiet, you wretch! And yet we poor women,” she went on, “are forbidden\npleasures far less voluptuous than this. There is no flesh in the world as\nsoft as these. None. When M. Verdurin did me the honour of being madly\njealous... come, you might at least be polite. Don’t say that you never\nhave been jealous!”",
        "“But, my dear, I have said absolutely nothing. Look here, Doctor, I call\nyou as a witness; did I utter a word?”",
        "Swann had begun, out of politeness, to finger the bronzes, and did not\nlike to stop.",
        "“Come along; you can caress them later; now it is you that are going to be\ncaressed, caressed in the ear; you’ll like that, I think. Here’s the young\ngentleman who will take charge of that.”",
        "After the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him\nthan in any of the other guests, for the following reason:",
        "The year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music played\non the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the material\nquality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it had been a\nsource of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin-part,\ndelicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly\nperceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of\nsound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent, level, and\nbreaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea,\nsilvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at a given\nmoment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline, or to give a\nname to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had tried to\ncollect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony–he knew not\nwhich–that had just been played, and had opened and expanded his soul,\njust as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist air of\nevening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was owing to\nhis own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an\nimpression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only purely\nmusical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original, and\nirreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order, vanishing in\nan instant, is, so to speak, an impression sine materia. Presumably the\nnotes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes,\nover surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume; to\ntrace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation of breath or tenuity,\nstability or caprice. But the notes themselves have vanished before these\nsensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those\nwhich the following, or even simultaneous notes have already begun to\nawaken in us. And this indefinite perception would continue to smother in\nits molten liquidity the motifs which now and then emerge, barely\ndiscernible, to plunge again and disappear and drown; recognised only by\nthe particular kind of pleasure which they instil, impossible to describe,\nto recollect, to name; ineffable;–if our memory, like a labourer who\ntoils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the\nwaves, did not, by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases,\nenable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow. And so,\nhardly had the delicious sensation, which Swann had experienced, died\naway, before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript,\nsummary, it is true, and provisional, but one on which he had kept his\neyes fixed while the playing continued, so effectively that, when the same\nimpression suddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able\nto picture to himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its\nnotation, the strength of its expression; he had before him that definite\nobject which was no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture,\nthought, and which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he\nhad distinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments\nfrom the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to\npartake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he\nhad never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could\ninitiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and\nstrange desire.",
        "With a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere,\ntowards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly indicated.\nAnd then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was\nprepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it changed its\ndirection, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform, melancholy,\nincessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys\nunknown.  Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing, that he\nmight find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though without\nspeaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure less\nprofound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he was like a\nman into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment passing by, has\nbrought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and enlarges his own power\nof perception, without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her\nagain whom he loves already, although he knows nothing of her, not even\nher name.",
        "Indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few months,\nto be bringing into Swann’s life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation.\nHe had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any\nideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral\nsatisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally\nstating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in\nthat condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his\nmind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe in\n(although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had grown\nalso into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which\nallowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance. Just as\nhe had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better\nby not going into society, knowing very well that if he had accepted an\ninvitation he must put in an appearance, and that afterwards, if he did\nnot actually call, he must at least leave cards upon his hostess; so in\nhis conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal\nopinion about a thing, but instead would supply facts and details which\nhad a value of a sort in themselves, and excused him from shewing how much\nhe really knew. He would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish,\nthe dates of a painter’s birth and death, and the titles of his works.\nSometimes, in spite of himself, he would let himself go so far as to utter\na criticism of a work of art, or of some one’s interpretation of life, but\nthen he would cloak his words in a tone of irony, as though he did not\naltogether associate himself with what he was saying. But now, like a\nconfirmed invalid whom, all of a sudden, a change of air and surroundings,\nor a new course of treatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change\nin himself, spontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered\nfrom his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto\nbeyond all hope, of starting to lead–and better late than never–a wholly\ndifferent life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that\nhe had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over\nto him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase among\nthem, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had\nceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon the\nmoral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative\ninfluence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of the\npower to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out whose\nwork it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been unable to\nprocure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had indeed, in the\ncourse of the next few days, encountered several of the people who had\nbeen at the party with him, and had questioned them; but most of them had\neither arrived after or left before the piece was played; some had indeed\nbeen in the house, but had gone into another room to talk, and those who\nhad stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest.  As for his\nhosts, they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians\nwhom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play;\nbut, as these last were now on tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing\nfurther. He had, of course, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as\nhe could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little\nphrase had given him, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that\nit had traced in outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them\nthe air. And so, at last, he ceased to think of it.",
        "But to-night, at Mme. Verdurin’s, scarcely had the little pianist begun to\nplay when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole bars,\nSwann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that resonance,\nwhich was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain of sound, to\nveil the mystery of its birth–and recognised, secret, whispering,\narticulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved. And it was so\npeculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which nothing else could\nhave replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met, in a friend’s\ndrawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once, in the street,\nand had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the phrase withdrew\nand vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the wandering currents\nof its fragrance, leaving upon Swann’s features a reflection of its smile.\nBut now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown (and was told\nthat it was the andante movement of Vinteuil’s sonata for the piano and\nviolin), he held it safe, could have it again to himself, at home, as\noften as he would, could study its language and acquire its secret.",
        "And so, when the pianist had finished, Swann crossed the room and thanked\nhim with a vivacity which delighted Mme. Verdurin.",
        "“Isn’t he charming?” she asked Swann, “doesn’t he just understand it, his\nsonata, the little wretch? You never dreamed, did you, that a piano could\nbe made to express all that? Upon my word, there’s everything in it except\nthe piano! I’m caught out every time I hear it; I think I’m listening to\nan orchestra. Though it’s better, really, than an orchestra, more\ncomplete.”",
        "The young pianist bent over her as he answered, smiling and underlining\neach of his words as though he were making an epigram: “You are most\ngenerous to me.”",
        "And while Mme. Verdurin was saying to her husband, “Run and fetch him a\nglass of orangeade; it’s well earned!” Swann began to tell Odette how he\nhad fallen in love with that little phrase. When their hostess, who was a\nlittle way off, called out, “Well! It looks to me as though some one was\nsaying nice things to you, Odette!” she replied, “Yes, very nice,” and he\nfound her simplicity delightful. Then he asked for some information about\nthis Vinteuil; what else he had done, and at what period in his life he\nhad composed the sonata;–what meaning the little phrase could have had\nfor him, that was what Swann wanted most to know.",
        "But none of these people who professed to admire this musician (when Swann\nhad said that the sonata was really charming Mme. Verdurin had exclaimed,\n\"I quite believe it! Charming, indeed! But you don’t dare to confess that\nyou don’t know Vinteuil’s sonata; you have no right not to know it!\"–and\nthe painter had gone on with, “Ah, yes, it’s a very fine bit of work,\nisn’t it? Not, of course, if you want something ’obvious,’ something\n’popular,’ but, I mean to say, it makes a very great impression on us\nartists.”), none of them seemed ever to have asked himself these\nquestions, for none of them was able to reply.",
        "Even to one or two particular remarks made by Swann on his favourite\nphrase, “D’you know, that’s a funny thing; I had never noticed it; I may\nas well tell you that I don’t much care about peering at things through a\nmicroscope, and pricking myself on pin-points of difference; no; we don’t\nwaste time splitting hairs in this house; why not? well, it’s not a habit\nof ours, that’s all,” Mme. Verdurin replied, while Dr. Cottard gazed at\nher with open-mouthed admiration, and yearned to be able to follow her as\nshe skipped lightly from one stepping-stone to another of her stock of\nready-made phrases. Both he, however, and Mme. Cottard, with a kind of\ncommon sense which is shared by many people of humble origin, would always\ntake care not to express an opinion, or to pretend to admire a piece of\nmusic which they would confess to each other, once they were safely at\nhome, that they no more understood than they could understand the art of\n’Master’ Biche. Inasmuch as the public cannot recognise the charm, the\nbeauty, even the outlines of nature save in the stereotyped impressions of\nan art which they have gradually assimilated, while an original artist\nstarts by rejecting those impressions, so M. and Mme.  Cottard, typical,\nin this respect, of the public, were incapable of finding, either in\nVinteuil’s sonata or in Biche’s portraits, what constituted harmony, for\nthem, in music or beauty in painting. It appeared to them, when the\npianist played his sonata, as though he were striking haphazard from the\npiano a medley of notes which bore no relation to the musical forms to\nwhich they themselves were accustomed, and that the painter simply flung\nthe colours haphazard upon his canvas. When, on one of these, they were\nable to distinguish a human form, they always found it coarsened and\nvulgarised (that is to say lacking all the elegance of the school of\npainting through whose spectacles they themselves were in the habit of\nseeing the people–real, living people, who passed them in the streets)\nand devoid of truth, as though M. Biche had not known how the human\nshoulder was constructed, or that a woman’s hair was not, ordinarily,\npurple.",
        "And yet, when the ’faithful’ were scattered out of earshot, the Doctor\nfelt that the opportunity was too good to be missed, and so (while Mme.\nVerdurin was adding a final word of commendation of Vinteuil’s sonata)\nlike a would-be swimmer who jumps into the water, so as to learn, but\nchooses a moment when there are not too many people looking on: “Yes,\nindeed; he’s what they call a musician di primo cartello!” he exclaimed,\nwith a sudden determination.",
        "Swann discovered no more than that the recent publication of Vinteuil’s\nsonata had caused a great stir among the most advanced school of\nmusicians, but that it was still unknown to the general public.",
        "“I know some one, quite well, called Vinteuil,” said Swann, thinking of\nthe old music-master at Combray who had taught my grandmother’s sisters.",
        "“Perhaps that’s the man!” cried Mme. Verdurin.",
        "“Oh, no!” Swann burst out laughing. “If you had ever seen him for a moment\nyou wouldn’t put the question.”",
        "“Then to put the question is to solve the problem?” the Doctor suggested.",
        "“But it may well be some relative,” Swann went on. “That would be bad\nenough; but, after all, there is no reason why a genius shouldn’t have a\ncousin who is a silly old fool. And if that should be so, I swear there’s\nno known or unknown form of torture I wouldn’t undergo to get the old fool\nto introduce me to the man who composed the sonata; starting with the\ntorture of the old fool’s company, which would be ghastly.”",
        "The painter understood that Vinteuil was seriously ill at the moment, and\nthat Dr. Potain despaired of his life.",
        "“What!” cried Mme. Verdurin, “Do people still call in Potain?”",
        "“Ah! Mme. Verdurin,” Cottard simpered, “you forget that you are speaking\nof one of my colleagues–I should say, one of my masters.”",
        "The painter had heard, somewhere, that Vinteuil was threatened with\nthe loss of his reason. And he insisted that signs of this could be\ndetected in certain passages in the sonata. This remark did not strike\nSwann as ridiculous; rather, it puzzled him. For, since a purely musical\nwork contains none of those logical sequences, the interruption or\nconfusion of which, in spoken or written language, is a proof of insanity,\nso insanity diagnosed in a sonata seemed to him as mysterious a thing as\nthe insanity of a dog or a horse, although instances may be observed of\nthese.",
        "“Don’t speak to me about ’your masters’; you know ten times as much as he\ndoes!” Mme. Verdurin answered Dr. Cottard, in the tone of a woman who has\nthe courage of her convictions, and is quite ready to stand up to anyone\nwho disagrees with her. “Anyhow, you don’t kill your patients!”",
        "“But, Madame, he is in the Academy.” The Doctor smiled with bitter irony.\n\"If a sick person prefers to die at the hands of one of the Princes of\nScience... It is far more smart to be able to say, ’Yes, I have Potain.’”",
        "“Oh, indeed! More smart, is it?” said Mme. Verdurin. “So there are\nfashions, nowadays, in illness, are there? I didn’t know that.... Oh, you\ndo make me laugh!” she screamed, suddenly, burying her face in her hands.\n\"And here was I, poor thing, talking quite seriously, and never seeing\nthat you were pulling my leg.”",
        "As for M. Verdurin, finding it rather a strain to start laughing again\nover so small a matter, he was content with puffing out a cloud of smoke\nfrom his pipe, while he reflected sadly that he could never again hope to\nkeep pace with his wife in her Atalanta-flights across the field of mirth.",
        "“D’you know; we like your friend so very much,” said Mme. Verdurin, later,\nwhen Odette was bidding her good night. “He is so unaffected, quite\ncharming. If they’re all like that, the friends you want to bring here, by\nall means bring them.”",
        "M. Verdurin remarked that Swann had failed, all the same, to appreciate\nthe pianist’s aunt.",
        "“I dare say he felt a little strange, poor man,” suggested Mme. Verdurin.\n\"You can’t expect him to catch the tone of the house the first time he\ncomes; like Cottard, who has been one of our little ’clan’ now for years.\nThe first time doesn’t count; it’s just for looking round and finding out\nthings. Odette, he understands all right, he’s to join us to-morrow at the\nChâtelet. Perhaps you might call for him and bring him.” “No, he doesn’t\nwant that.”",
        "“Oh, very well; just as you like. Provided he doesn’t fail us at the last\nmoment.”",
        "Greatly to Mme. Verdurin’s surprise, he never failed them. He would go to\nmeet them, no matter where, at restaurants outside Paris (not that they\nwent there much at first, for the season had not yet begun), and more\nfrequently at the play, in which Mme. Verdurin delighted. One evening,\nwhen they were dining at home, he heard her complain that she had not one\nof those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting at doors and\nstanding in crowds, and say how useful it would be to them at\nfirst-nights, and gala performances at the Opera, and what a nuisance it\nhad been, not having one, on the day of Gambetta’s funeral. Swann never\nspoke of his distinguished friends, but only of such as might be regarded\nas detrimental, whom, therefore, he thought it snobbish, and in not very\ngood taste to conceal; while he frequented the Faubourg Saint-Germain he\nhad come to include, in the latter class, all his friends in the official\nworld of the Third Republic, and so broke in, without thinking: “I’ll see\nto that, all right. You shall have it in time for the Danicheff revival.\nI shall be lunching with the Prefect of Police to-morrow, as it happens,\nat the Elysée.”",
        "“What’s that? The Elysée?” Dr. Cottard roared in a voice of thunder.",
        "“Yes, at M. Grévy’s,” replied Swann, feeling a little awkward at the\neffect which his announcement had produced.",
        "“Are you often taken like that?” the painter asked Cottard, with\nmock-seriousness.",
        "As a rule, once an explanation had been given, Cottard would say: “Ah,\ngood, good; that’s all right, then,” after which he would shew not the\nleast trace of emotion. But this time Swann’s last words, instead of the\nusual calming effect, had that of heating, instantly, to boiling-point his\nastonishment at the discovery that a man with whom he himself was actually\nsitting at table, a man who had no official position, no honours or\ndistinction of any sort, was on visiting terms with the Head of the State.",
        "“What’s that you say? M. Grévy? Do you know M. Grévy?” he demanded of\nSwann, in the stupid and incredulous tone of a constable on duty at the\npalace, when a stranger has come up and asked to see the President of the\nRepublic; until, guessing from his words and manner what, as the\nnewspapers say, ’it is a case of,’ he assures the poor lunatic that he\nwill be admitted at once, and points the way to the reception ward of the\npolice infirmary.",
        "“I know him slightly; we have some friends in common” (Swann dared not add\nthat one of these friends was the Prince of Wales). “Anyhow, he is very\nfree with his invitations, and, I assure you, his luncheon-parties are not\nthe least bit amusing; they’re very simple affairs, too, you know; never\nmore than eight at table,” he went on, trying desperately to cut out\neverything that seemed to shew off his relations with the President in a\nlight too dazzling for the Doctor’s eyes.",
        "Whereupon Cottard, at once conforming in his mind to the literal\ninterpretation of what Swann was saying, decided that invitations from M.\nGrévy were very little sought after, were sent out, in fact, into the\nhighways and hedge-rows. And from that moment he never seemed at all\nsurprised to hear that Swann, or anyone else, was ’always at the Elysée’;\nhe even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to luncheon-parties\nwhich, he himself admitted, were a bore.",
        "“Ah, good, good; that’s quite all right then,” he said, in the tone of a\ncustoms official who has been suspicious up to now, but, after hearing\nyour explanations, stamps your passport and lets you proceed on your\njourney without troubling to examine your luggage.",
        "“I can well believe you don’t find them amusing, those parties; indeed,\nit’s very good of you to go to them!” said Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the\nPresident of the Republic only as a ’bore’ to be especially dreaded, since\nhe had at his disposal means of seduction, and even of compulsion, which,\nif employed to captivate her ’faithful,’ might easily make them ’fail.’\n\"It seems, he’s as deaf as a post; and eats with his fingers.”",
        "“Upon my word! Then it can’t be much fun for you, going there.” A note of\npity sounded in the Doctor’s voice; and then struck by the number–only\neight at table–\"Are these luncheons what you would describe as\n’intimate’?” he inquired briskly, not so much out of idle curiosity as in\nhis linguistic zeal.",
        "But so great and glorious a figure was the President of the French\nRepublic in the eyes of Dr. Cottard that neither the modesty of Swann nor\nthe spite of Mme. Verdurin could ever wholly efface that first impression,\nand he never sat down to dinner with the Verdurins without asking\nanxiously, “D’you think we shall see M. Swann here this evening? He is a\npersonal friend of M. Grévy’s. I suppose that means he’s what you’d call a\n’gentleman’?” He even went to the length of offering Swann a card of\ninvitation to the Dental Exhibition.",
        "“This will let you in, and anyone you take with you,” he explained, “but\ndogs are not admitted. I’m just warning you, you understand, because some\nfriends of mine went there once, who hadn’t been told, and there was the\ndevil to pay.”",
        "As for M. Verdurin, he did not fail to observe the distressing effect upon\nhis wife of the discovery that Swann had influential friends of whom he\nhad never spoken.",
        "If no arrangement had been made to ’go anywhere,’ it was at the Verdurins’\nthat Swann would find the ’little nucleus’ assembled, but he never\nappeared there except in the evenings, and would hardly ever accept their\ninvitations to dinner, in spite of Odette’s entreaties.",
        "“I could dine with you alone somewhere, if you’d rather,” she suggested.",
        "“But what about Mme. Verdurin?”",
        "“Oh, that’s quite simple. I need only say that my dress wasn’t ready, or\nthat my cab came late. There is always some excuse.”",
        "“How charming of you.”",
        "But Swann said to himself that, if he could make Odette feel (by\nconsenting to meet her only after dinner) that there were other pleasures\nwhich he preferred to that of her company, then the desire that she felt\nfor his would be all the longer in reaching the point of satiety. Besides,\nas he infinitely preferred to Odette’s style of beauty that of a little\nworking girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom he happened to be\nsimultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the first part of the\nevening with her, knowing that he was sure to see Odette later on. For the\nsame reason, he would never allow Odette to call for him at his house, to\ntake him on to the Verdurins’. The little girl used to wait, not far from\nhis door, at a street corner; Rémi, his coachman, knew where to stop; she\nwould jump in beside him, and hold him in her arms until the carriage drew\nup at the Verdurins’. He would enter the drawing-room; and there, while\nMme.  Verdurin, pointing to the roses which he had sent her that morning,\nsaid: “I am furious with you!” and sent him to the place kept for him, by\nthe side of Odette, the pianist would play to them–for their two selves,\nand for no one else–that little phrase by Vinteuil which was, so to\nspeak, the national anthem of their love. He began, always, with a\nsustained tremolo from the violin part, which, for several bars, was\nunaccompanied, and filled all the foreground; until suddenly it seemed to\nbe drawn aside, and–just as in those interiors by Pieter de Hooch, where\nthe subject is set back a long way through the narrow framework of a\nhalf-opened door–infinitely remote, in colour quite different, velvety\nwith the radiance of some intervening light, the little phrase appeared,\ndancing, pastoral, interpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It\npassed, with simple and immortal movements, scattering on every side the\nbounties of its grace, smiling ineffably still; but Swann thought that he\ncould now discern in it some disenchantment. It seemed to be aware how\nvain, how hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way. In its airy\ngrace there was, indeed, something definitely achieved, and complete in\nitself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an outburst\nof vain regret.  But little did that matter to him; he looked upon the\nsonata less in its own light–as what it might express, had, in fact,\nexpressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any Swann or Odette,\nanywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and would express to\nall those who should hear it played in centuries to come–than as a\npledge, a token of his love, which made even the Verdurins and their\nlittle pianist think of Odette and, at the same time, of himself–which\nbound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that point he had (whimsically\nentreated by Odette) abandoned the idea of getting some ’professional’ to\nplay over to him the whole sonata, of which he still knew no more than\nthis one passage. “Why do you want the rest?” she had asked him. “Our\nlittle bit; that’s all we need.” He went farther; agonised by the\nreflection, at the moment when it passed by him, so near and yet so\ninfinitely remote, that, while it was addressed to their ears, it knew\nthem not, he would regret, almost, that it had a meaning of its own, an\nintrinsic and unalterable beauty, foreign to themselves, just as in the\njewels given to us, or even in the letters written to us by a woman with\nwhom we are in love, we find fault with the ’water’ of a stone, or with\nthe words of a sentence because they are not fashioned exclusively from\nthe spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of a ’lass unparalleled.’",
        "It would happen, as often as not, that he had stayed so long outside, with\nhis little girl, before going to the Verdurins’ that, as soon as the\nlittle phrase had been rendered by the pianist, Swann would discover that\nit was almost time for Odette to go home. He used to take her back as far\nas the door of her little house in the Rue La Pérouse, behind the Arc de\nTriomphe. And it was perhaps on this account, and so as not to demand the\nmonopoly of her favours, that he sacrificed the pleasure (not so essential\nto his well-being) of seeing her earlier in the evening, of arriving with\nher at the Verdurins’, to the exercise of this other privilege, for which\nshe was grateful, of their leaving together; a privilege which he valued\nall the more because, thanks to it, he had the feeling that no one else\nwould see her, no one would thrust himself between them, no one could\nprevent him from remaining with her in spirit, after he had left her for\nthe night.",
        "And so, night after night, she would be taken home in Swann’s carriage;\nand one night, after she had got down, and while he stood at the gate and\nmurmured “Till to-morrow, then!” she turned impulsively from him, plucked\na last lingering chrysanthemum in the tiny garden which flanked the\npathway from the street to her house, and as he went back to his carriage\nthrust it into his hand. He held it pressed to his lips during the drive\nhome, and when, in due course, the flower withered, locked it away, like\nsomething very precious, in a secret drawer of his desk.",
        "He would escort her to her gate, but no farther. Twice only had he gone\ninside to take part in the ceremony–of such vital importance in her life\n–of ’afternoon tea.’ The loneliness and emptiness of those short streets\n(consisting, almost entirely, of low-roofed houses, self-contained but not\ndetached, their monotony interrupted here and there by the dark intrusion\nof some sinister little shop, at once an historical document and a sordid\nsurvival from the days when the district was still one of ill repute), the\nsnow which had lain on the garden-beds or clung to the branches of the\ntrees, the careless disarray of the season, the assertion, in this\nman-made city, of a state of nature, had all combined to add an element of\nmystery to the warmth, the flowers, the luxury which he had found inside.",
        "Passing by (on his left-hand side, and on what, although raised some way\nabove the street, was the ground floor of the house) Odette’s bedroom,\nwhich looked out to the back over another little street running parallel\nwith her own, he had climbed a staircase that went straight up between\ndark painted walls, from which hung Oriental draperies, strings of Turkish\nbeads, and a huge Japanese lantern, suspended by a silken cord from the\nceiling (which last, however, so that her visitors should not have to\ncomplain of the want of any of the latest comforts of Western\ncivilisation, was lighted by a gas-jet inside), to the two drawing-rooms,\nlarge and small. These were entered through a narrow lobby, the wall of\nwhich, chequered with the lozenges of a wooden trellis such as you see on\ngarden walls, only gilded, was lined from end to end by a long rectangular\nbox in which bloomed, as though in a hothouse, a row of large\nchrysanthemums, at that time still uncommon, though by no means so large\nas the mammoth blossoms which horticulturists have since succeeded in\nmaking grow. Swann was irritated, as a rule, by the sight of these\nflowers, which had then been ’the rage’ in Paris for about a year, but it\nhad pleased him, on this occasion, to see the gloom of the little lobby\nshot with rays of pink and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these\nephemeral stars, which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of\nwinter afternoons.  Odette had received him in a tea-gown of pink silk,\nwhich left her neck and arms bare. She had made him sit down beside her in\none of the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the\nvarious recesses of the room, sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing out\nof pots of Chinese porcelain, or by screens upon which were fastened\nphotographs and fans and bows of ribbon. She had said at once, “You’re not\ncomfortable there; wait a minute, I’ll arrange things for you,” and with a\ntitter of laughter, the complacency of which implied that some little\ninvention of her own was being brought into play, she had installed behind\nhis head and beneath his feet great cushions of Japanese silk, which she\npummelled and buffeted as though determined to lavish on him all her\nriches, and regardless of their value. But when her footman began to come\ninto the room, bringing, one after another, the innumerable lamps which\n(contained, mostly, in porcelain vases) burned singly or in pairs upon the\ndifferent pieces of furniture as upon so many altars, rekindling in the\ntwilight, already almost nocturnal, of this winter afternoon, the glow of\na sunset more lasting, more roseate, more human–filling, perhaps, with\nromantic wonder the thoughts of some solitary lover, wandering in the\nstreet below and brought to a standstill before the mystery of the human\npresence which those lighted windows at once revealed and screened from\nsight–she had kept an eye sharply fixed on the servant, to see whether he\nset each of the lamps down in the place appointed it.  She felt that, if\nhe were to put even one of them where it ought not to be, the general\neffect of her drawing-room would be destroyed, and that her portrait,\nwhich rested upon a sloping easel draped with plush, would not catch the\nlight. And so, with feverish impatience, she followed the man’s clumsy\nmovements, scolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of\nbeaupots, which she made a point of always tidying herself, in case the\nplants should be knocked over–and went across to them now to make sure\nthat he had not broken off any of the flowers. She found something\n’quaint’ in the shape of each of her Chinese ornaments, and also in her\norchids, the cattleyas especially (these being, with chrysanthemums, her\nfavourite flowers), because they had the supreme merit of not looking in\nthe least like other flowers, but of being made, apparently, out of scraps\nof silk or satin. “It looks just as though it had been cut out of the\nlining of my cloak,” she said to Swann, pointing to an orchid, with a\nshade of respect in her voice for so ’smart’ a flower, for this\ndistinguished, unexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon\nher, so far removed from her in the scale of existence, and yet so\ndelicate, so refined, so much more worthy than many real women of\nadmission to her drawing-room.  As she drew his attention, now to the\nfiery-tongued dragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a fire-screen,\nnow to a fleshy cluster of orchids, now to a dromedary of inlaid\nsilver-work with ruby eyes, which kept company, upon her mantelpiece, with\na toad carved in jade, she would pretend now to be shrinking from the\nferocity of the monsters or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at\nthe indecency of the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire\nto run across and kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them ’darlings.’\nAnd these affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of\nher attitudes, notably her devotion to Our Lady of the Laghetto who had\nonce, when Odette was living at Nice, cured her of a mortal illness, and\nwhose medal, in gold, she always carried on her person, attributing to it\nunlimited powers. She poured out Swann’s tea, inquired “Lemon or cream?\"\nand, on his answering “Cream, please,” went on, smiling, “A cloud!” And as\nhe pronounced it excellent, “You see, I know just how you like it.” This\ntea had indeed seemed to Swann, just as it seemed to her, something\nprecious, and love is so far obliged to find some justification for\nitself, some guarantee of its duration in pleasures which, on the\ncontrary, would have no existence apart from love and must cease with its\npassing, that when he left her, at seven o’clock, to go and dress for the\nevening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright in his brougham, unable to\nrepress the happiness with which the afternoon’s adventure had filled him,\nhe kept on repeating to himself: “What fun it would be to have a little\nwoman like that in a place where one could always be certain of finding,\nwhat one never can be certain of finding, a really good cup of tea.” An\nhour or so later he received a note from Odette, and at once recognised\nthat florid handwriting, in which an affectation of British stiffness\nimposed an apparent discipline upon its shapeless characters, significant,\nperhaps, to less intimate eyes than his, of an untidiness of mind, a\nfragmentary education, a want of sincerity and decision. Swann had left\nhis cigarette-case at her house. “Why,” she wrote, “did you not forget\nyour heart also? I should never have let you have that back.”",
        "More important, perhaps, was a second visit which he paid her, a little\nlater. On his way to the house, as always when he knew that they were to\nmeet, he formed a picture of her in his mind; and the necessity, if he was\nto find any beauty in her face, of fixing his eyes on the fresh and rosy\nprotuberance of her cheekbones, and of shutting out all the rest of those\ncheeks which were so often languorous and sallow, except when they were\npunctuated with little fiery spots, plunged him in acute depression, as\nproving that one’s ideal is always unattainable, and one’s actual\nhappiness mediocre. He was taking her an engraving which she had asked to\nsee.  She was not very well; she received him, wearing a wrapper of mauve\ncrêpe de Chine, which draped her bosom, like a mantle, with a richly\nembroidered web. As she stood there beside him, brushing his cheek with\nthe loosened tresses of her hair, bending one knee in what was almost a\ndancer’s pose, so that she could lean without tiring herself over the\npicture, at which she was gazing, with bended head, out of those great\neyes, which seemed so weary and so sullen when there was nothing to\nanimate her, Swann was struck by her resemblance to the figure of\nZipporah, Jethro’s Daughter, which is to be seen in one of the Sixtine\nfrescoes. He had always found a peculiar fascination in tracing in the\npaintings of the Old Masters, not merely the general characteristics of\nthe people whom he encountered in his daily life, but rather what seems\nleast susceptible of generalisation, the individual features of men and\nwomen whom he knew, as, for instance, in a bust of the Doge Loredan by\nAntonio Rizzo, the prominent cheekbones, the slanting eyebrows, in short,\na speaking likeness to his own coachman Rémi; in the colouring of a\nGhirlandaio, the nose of M.  de Palancy; in a portrait by Tintoretto, the\ninvasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker, the\nbroken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon.\nPerhaps because he had always regretted, in his heart, that he had\nconfined his attention to the social side of life, had talked, always,\nrather than acted, he felt that he might find a sort of indulgence\nbestowed upon him by those great artists, in his perception of the fact\nthat they also had regarded with pleasure and had admitted into the canon\nof their works such types of physiognomy as give those works the strongest\npossible certificate of reality and trueness to life; a modern, almost a\ntopical savour; perhaps, also, he had so far succumbed to the prevailing\nfrivolity of the world of fashion that he felt the necessity of finding in\nan old masterpiece some such obvious and refreshing allusion to a person\nabout whom jokes could be made and repeated and enjoyed to-day. Perhaps,\non the other hand, he had retained enough of the artistic temperament to\nbe able to find a genuine satisfaction in watching these individual\nfeatures take on a more general significance when he saw them, uprooted\nand disembodied, in the abstract idea of similarity between an historic\nportrait and a modern original, whom it was not intended to represent.\nHowever that might be, and perhaps because the abundance of impressions\nwhich he, for some time past, had been receiving–though, indeed, they had\ncome to him rather through the channel of his appreciation of music–had\nenriched his appetite for painting as well, it was with an unusual\nintensity of pleasure, a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon\nhis character and conduct, that Swann remarked Odette’s resemblance to the\nZipporah of that Alessandro de Mariano, to whom one shrinks from giving\nhis more popular surname, now that ’Botticelli’ suggests not so much the\nactual work of the Master as that false and banal conception of it which\nhas of late obtained common currency. He no longer based his estimate of\nthe merit of Odette’s face on the more or less good quality of her cheeks,\nand the softness and sweetness–as of carnation-petals–which, he\nsupposed, would greet his lips there, should he ever hazard an embrace,\nbut regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken threads,\nwhich his gazing eyes collected and wound together, following the curving\nline from the skein to the ball, where he mingled the cadence of her neck\nwith the spring of her hair and the droop of her eyelids, as though from a\nportrait of herself, in which her type was made clearly intelligible.",
        "He stood gazing at her; traces of the old fresco were apparent in her face\nand limbs, and these he tried incessantly, afterwards, to recapture, both\nwhen he was with Odette, and when he was only thinking of her in her\nabsence; and, albeit his admiration for the Florentine masterpiece was\nprobably based upon his discovery that it had been reproduced in her, the\nsimilarity enhanced her beauty also, and rendered her more precious in his\nsight. Swann reproached himself with his failure, hitherto, to estimate at\nher true worth a creature whom the great Sandro would have adored, and\ncounted himself fortunate that his pleasure in the contemplation of Odette\nfound a justification in his own system of aesthetic.  He told himself\nthat, in choosing the thought of Odette as the inspiration of his dreams\nof ideal happiness, he was not, as he had until then supposed, falling\nback, merely, upon an expedient of doubtful and certainly inadequate\nvalue, since she contained in herself what satisfied the utmost refinement\nof his taste in art. He failed to observe that this quality would not\nnaturally avail to bring Odette into the category of women whom he found\ndesirable, simply because his desires had always run counter to his\naesthetic taste. The words ’Florentine painting’ were invaluable to Swann.\nThey enabled him (gave him, as it were, a legal title) to introduce the\nimage of Odette into a world of dreams and fancies which, until then, she\nhad been debarred from entering, and where she assumed a new and nobler\nform. And whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh, by perpetually\nreviving his misgivings as to the quality of her face, her figure, the\nwhole of her beauty, used to cool the ardour of his love, those misgivings\nwere swept away and that love confirmed now that he could re-erect his\nestimate of her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles; while\nthe kiss, the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but\nmoderately attractive, had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat\nwithered flesh and sluggish blood, coming, as now they came, to crown his\nadoration of a masterpiece in a gallery, must, it seemed, prove as\nexquisite as they would be supernatural.",
        "And when he was tempted to regret that, for months past, he had done\nnothing but visit Odette, he would assure himself that he was not\nunreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an inestimably\nprecious work of art, cast for once in a new, a different, an especially\ncharming metal, in an unmatched exemplar which he would contemplate at one\nmoment with the humble, spiritual, disinterested mind of an artist, at\nanother with the pride, the selfishness, the sensual thrill of a\ncollector.",
        "On his study table, at which he worked, he had placed, as it were a\nphotograph of Odette, a reproduction of Jethro’s Daughter. He would gaze\nin admiration at the large eyes, the delicate features in which the\nimperfection of her skin might be surmised, the marvellous locks of hair\nthat fell along her tired cheeks; and, adapting what he had already felt\nto be beautiful, on aesthetic grounds, to the idea of a living woman, he\nconverted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated\nhimself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might,\nultimately, possess. The vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a\nspectator to a work of art, now that he knew the type, in warm flesh and\nblood, of Jethro’s Daughter, became a desire which more than compensated,\nthenceforward, for that with which Odette’s physical charms had at first\nfailed to inspire him. When he had sat for a long time gazing at the\nBotticelli, he would think of his own living Botticelli, who seemed all\nthe lovelier in contrast, and as he drew towards him the photograph of\nZipporah he would imagine that he was holding Odette against his heart.",
        "It was not only Odette’s indifference, however, that he must take pains to\ncircumvent; it was also, not infrequently, his own; feeling that, since\nOdette had had every facility for seeing him, she seemed no longer to have\nvery much to say to him when they did meet, he was afraid lest the\nmanner–at once trivial, monotonous, and seemingly unalterable–which she\nnow adopted when they were together should ultimately destroy in him that\nromantic hope, that a day might come when she would make avowal of her\npassion, by which hope alone he had become and would remain her lover. And\nso to alter, to give a fresh moral aspect to that Odette, of whose\nunchanging mood he was afraid of growing weary, he wrote, suddenly, a\nletter full of hinted discoveries and feigned indignation, which he sent\noff so that it should reach her before dinner-time. He knew that she would\nbe frightened, and that she would reply, and he hoped that, when the fear\nof losing him clutched at her heart, it would force from her words such as\nhe had never yet heard her utter: and he was right–by repeating this\ndevice he had won from her the most affectionate letters that she had, so\nfar, written him, one of them (which she had sent to him at midday by a\nspecial messenger from the Maison Dorée–it was the day of the\nParis-Murcie Fête given for the victims of the recent floods in Murcia)\nbeginning “My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write––\";\nand these letters he had kept in the same drawer as the withered\nchrysanthemum. Or else, if she had not had time to write, when he arrived\nat the Verdurins’ she would come running up to him with an “I’ve something\nto say to you!” and he would gaze curiously at the revelation in her face\nand speech of what she had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart.",
        "Even as he drew near to the Verdurins’ door, and caught sight of the great\nlamp-lit spaces of the drawing-room windows, whose shutters were never\nclosed, he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming creature\nwhom he would see, as he entered the room, basking in that golden light.\nHere and there the figures of the guests stood out, sharp and black,\nbetween lamp and window, shutting off the light, like those little\npictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a glass\nscreen, whose other panes are mere transparencies. He would try to make\nout Odette.  And then, when he was once inside, without thinking, his eyes\nsparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that M. Verdurin said to the\npainter: “H’m. Seems to be getting warm.” Indeed, her presence gave the\nhouse what none other of the houses that he visited seemed to possess: a\nsort of tactual sense, a nervous system which ramified into each of its\nrooms and sent a constant stimulus to his heart.",
        "And so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism, namely\nthe ’little clan,’ were transformed for Swann into a series of daily\nencounters with Odette, and enabled him to feign indifference to the\nprospect of seeing her, or even a desire not to see her; in doing which he\nincurred no very great risk since, even although he had written to her\nduring the day, he would of necessity see her in the evening and accompany\nher home.",
        "But one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark\ndrive together, he had taken his other ’little girl’ all the way to the\nBois, so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at\nthe Verdurins’, he was so late in reaching them that Odette, supposing\nthat he did not intend to come, had already left. Seeing the room bare of\nher, Swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the sense\nthat he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began then for\nthe first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that certainty of\nfinding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of all our pleasures)\nreduced, if it did not altogether blind him to its dimensions.",
        "“Did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasn’t here?” M.\nVerdurin asked his wife. “I think we may say that he’s hooked.”",
        "“The face he pulled?” exploded Dr. Cottard who, having left the house for\na moment to visit a patient, had just returned to fetch his wife and did\nnot know whom they were discussing.",
        "“D’you mean to say you didn’t meet him on the doorstep–the loveliest of\nSwanns?”",
        "“No. M. Swann has been here?”",
        "“Just for a moment. We had a glimpse of a Swann tremendously agitated.  In\na state of nerves. You see, Odette had left.”",
        "“You mean to say that she has gone the ’whole hog’ with him; that she has\n’burned her boats’?” inquired the Doctor cautiously, testing the meaning\nof his phrases.",
        "“Why, of course not; there’s absolutely nothing in it; in fact, between\nyou and me, I think she’s making a great mistake, and behaving like a\nsilly little fool, which she is, incidentally.”",
        "“Come, come, come!” said M. Verdurin, “How on earth do you know that\nthere’s ’nothing in it’? We haven’t been there to see, have we now?”",
        "“She would have told me,” answered Mme. Verdurin with dignity. “I may say\nthat she tells me everything. As she has no one else at present, I told\nher that she ought to live with him. She makes out that she can’t; she\nadmits, she was immensely attracted by him, at first; but he’s always shy\nwith her, and that makes her shy with him. Besides, she doesn’t care for\nhim in that way, she says; it’s an ideal love, ’Platonic,’ you know; she’s\nafraid of rubbing the bloom off–oh, I don’t know half the things she\nsays, how should I? And yet he’s exactly the sort of man she wants.”",
        "“I beg to differ from you,” M. Verdurin courteously interrupted. “I am\nonly half satisfied with the gentleman. I feel that he ’poses.’”",
        "Mme. Verdurin’s whole body stiffened, her eyes stared blankly as though\nshe had suddenly been turned into a statue; a device by means of which she\nmight be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable word\nwhich seemed to imply that it was possible for people to ’pose’ in her\nhouse, and, therefore, that there were people in the world who ’mattered\nmore’ than herself.",
        "“Anyhow, if there is nothing in it, I don’t suppose it’s because our\nfriend believes in her virtue. And yet, you never know; he seems to\nbelieve in her intelligence. I don’t know whether you heard the way he\nlectured her the other evening about Vinteuil’s sonata. I am devoted to\nOdette, but really–to expound theories of aesthetic to her–the man must\nbe a prize idiot.”",
        "“Look here, I won’t have you saying nasty things about Odette,” broke in\nMme. Verdurin in her ’spoiled child’ manner. “She is charming.”",
        "“There’s no reason why she shouldn’t be charming; we are not saying\nanything nasty about her, only that she is not the embodiment of either\nvirtue or intellect. After all,” he turned to the painter, “does it matter\nso very much whether she is virtuous or not? You can’t tell; she might be\na great deal less charming if she were.”",
        "On the landing Swann had run into the Verdurins’ butler, who had been\nsomewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked\nby Odette to tell Swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she would\nprobably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at Prévost’s on her way home.\nSwann set off at once for Prévost’s, but every few yards his carriage was\nheld up by others, or by people crossing the street, loathsome obstacles\neach of which he would gladly have crushed beneath his wheels, were it not\nthat a policeman fumbling with a note-book would delay him even longer\nthan the actual passage of the pedestrian. He counted the minutes\nfeverishly, adding a few seconds to each so as to be quite certain that he\nhad not given himself short measure, and so, possibly, exaggerated\nwhatever chance there might actually be of his arriving at Prévost’s in\ntime, and of finding her still there. And then, in a moment of\nillumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep and is conscious\nof the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his mind has been\nwandering without any clear distinction between himself and them, Swann\nsuddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the thoughts which he\nhad been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard at the Verdurins’\nthat Odette had left, how novel the heartache from which he was suffering,\nbut of which he was only now conscious, as though he had just woken up.\nWhat! all this disturbance simply because he would not see Odette, now,\ntill to-morrow, exactly what he had been hoping, not an hour before, as he\ndrove toward Mme. Verdurin’s. He was obliged to admit also that now, as he\nsat in the same carriage and drove to Prévost’s, he was no longer the same\nman, was no longer alone even–but that a new personality was there beside\nhim, adhering to him, amalgamated with him, a creature from whom he might,\nperhaps, be unable to liberate himself, towards whom he might have to\nadopt some such stratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady. And\nyet, during this last moment in which he had felt that another, a fresh\npersonality was thus conjoined with his own, life had seemed, somehow,\nmore interesting.",
        "It was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at\nPrévost’s (the tension of waiting for which so ravished, stripped so bare\nthe intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea, not one\nmemory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take shelter\nand repose) would probably, after all, should it take place, be much the\nsame as all their meetings, of no great importance. As on every other\nevening, once he was in Odette’s company, once he had begun to cast\nfurtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to withdraw his\neyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of desire and believe\nno more in his indifference, he would cease to be able even to think of\nher, so busy would he be in the search for pretexts which would enable him\nnot to leave her immediately, and to assure himself, without betraying his\nconcern, that he would find her again, next evening, at the Verdurins’;\npretexts, that is to say, which would enable him to prolong for the time\nbeing, and to renew for one day more the disappointment, the torturing\ndeception that must always come to him with the vain presence of this\nwoman, whom he might approach, yet never dared embrace.",
        "She was not at Prevost’s; he must search for her, then, in every\nrestaurant upon the boulevards. To save time, while he went in one\ndirection, he sent in the other his coachman Rémi (Rizzo’s Doge Loredan)\nfor whom he presently–after a fruitless search–found himself waiting at\nthe spot where the carriage was to meet him. It did not appear, and Swann\ntantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching moment, as\none in which Rémi would say to him: “Sir, the lady is there,” or as one in\nwhich Rémi would say to him: “Sir, the lady was not in any of the cafés.\"\nAnd so he saw himself faced by the close of his evening–a thing uniform,\nand yet bifurcated by the intervening accident which would either put an\nend to his agony by discovering Odette, or would oblige him to abandon any\nhope of finding her that night, to accept the necessity of returning home\nwithout having seen her.",
        "The coachman returned; but, as he drew up opposite him, Swann asked, not\n\"Did you find the lady?” but “Remind me, to-morrow, to order in some more\nfirewood. I am sure we must be running short.” Perhaps he had persuaded\nhimself that, if Rémi had at last found Odette in some café, where she was\nwaiting for him still, then his night of misery was already obliterated by\nthe realisation, begun already in his mind, of a night of joy, and that\nthere was no need for him to hasten towards the attainment of a happiness\nalready captured and held in a safe place, which would not escape his\ngrasp again. But it was also by the force of inertia; there was in his\nsoul that want of adaptability which can be seen in the bodies of certain\npeople who, when the moment comes to avoid a collision, to snatch their\nclothes out of reach of a flame, or to perform any other such necessary\nmovement, take their time (as the saying is), begin by remaining for a\nmoment in their original position, as though seeking to find in it a\nstarting-point, a source of strength and motion. And probably, if the\ncoachman had interrupted him with, “I have found the lady,” he would have\nanswered, “Oh, yes, of course; that’s what I told you to do.  I had quite\nforgotten,” and would have continued to discuss his supply of firewood, so\nas to hide from his servant the emotion that he had felt, and to give\nhimself time to break away from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon\nhimself to pleasure.",
        "The coachman came back, however, with the report that he could not find\nher anywhere, and added the advice, as an old and privileged servant, “I\nthink, sir, that all we can do now is to go home.”",
        "But the air of indifference which Swann could so lightly assume when Rémi\nuttered his final, unalterable response, fell from him like a cast-off\ncloak when he saw Rémi attempt to make him abandon hope and retire from\nthe quest.",
        "“Certainly not!” he exclaimed. “We must find the lady. It is most\nimportant.  She would be extremely put out–it’s a business matter–and\nvexed with me if she didn’t see me.”",
        "“But I do not see how the lady can be vexed, sir,” answered Rémi, “since\nit was she that went away without waiting for you, sir, and said she was\ngoing to Prévost’s, and then wasn’t there.”",
        "Meanwhile the restaurants were closing, and their lights began to go out.\nUnder the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people strolling\nto and fro, barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness. Now and then\nthe ghost of a woman glided up to Swann, murmured a few words in his ear,\nasked him to take her home, and left him shuddering. Anxiously he explored\nevery one of these vaguely seen shapes, as though among the phantoms of\nthe dead, in the realms of darkness, he had been searching for a lost\nEurydice.",
        "Among all the methods by which love is brought into being, among all the\nagents which disseminate that blessed bane, there are few so efficacious\nas the great gust of agitation which, now and then, sweeps over the human\nspirit. For then the creature in whose company we are seeking amusement at\nthe moment, her lot is cast, her fate and ours decided, that is the\ncreature whom we shall henceforward love. It is not necessary that she\nshould have pleased us, up till then, any more, or even as much as others.\nAll that is necessary is that our taste for her should become exclusive.\nAnd that condition is fulfilled so soon as–in the moment when she has\nfailed to meet us–for the pleasure which we were on the point of enjoying\nin her charming company is abruptly substituted an anxious torturing\ndesire, whose object is the creature herself, an irrational, absurd\ndesire, which the laws of civilised society make it impossible to satisfy\nand difficult to assuage–the insensate, agonising desire to possess her.",
        "Swann made Rémi drive him to such restaurants as were still open; it was\nthe sole hypothesis, now, of that happiness which he had contemplated so\ncalmly; he no longer concealed his agitation, the price he set upon their\nmeeting, and promised, in case of success, to reward his coachman, as\nthough, by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce his\nown, he could bring it to pass, by a miracle, that Odette–assuming that\nshe had long since gone home to bed,–might yet be found seated in some\nrestaurant on the boulevards. He pursued the quest as far as the Maison\nDorée, burst twice into Tortoni’s and, still without catching sight of\nher, was emerging from the Café Anglais, striding with haggard gaze\ntowards his carriage, which was waiting for him at the corner of the\nBoulevard des Italiens, when he collided with a person coming in the\nopposite direction; it was Odette; she explained, later, that there had\nbeen no room at Prévost’s, that she had gone, instead, to sup at the\nMaison Dorée, and had been sitting there in an alcove where he must have\noverlooked her, and that she was now looking for her carriage.",
        "She had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm. As\nfor him, he had ransacked the streets of Paris, not that he supposed it\npossible that he should find her, but because he would have suffered even\nmore cruelly by abandoning the attempt. But now the joy (which, his reason\nhad never ceased to assure him, was not, that evening at least, to be\nrealised) was suddenly apparent, and more real than ever before; for he\nhimself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating probabilities,–it\nremained integral and external to himself; there was no need for him to\ndraw on his own resources to endow it with truth–’twas from itself that\nthere emanated, ’twas itself that projected towards him that truth whose\nglorious rays melted and scattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of\nloneliness which had lowered over him, that truth upon which he had\nsupported, nay founded, albeit unconsciously, his vision of bliss. So will\na traveller, who has come down, on a day of glorious weather, to the\nMediterranean shore, and is doubtful whether they still exist, those lands\nwhich he has left, let his eyes be dazzled, rather than cast a backward\nglance, by the radiance streaming towards him from the luminous and\nunfading azure at his feet.",
        "He climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting, and\nordered his own to follow.",
        "She had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas, and Swann could see, beneath the\nfilm of lace that covered her head, more of the same flowers fastened to a\nswansdown plume. She was wearing, under her cloak, a flowing gown of black\nvelvet, caught up on one side so as to reveal a large triangular patch of\nher white silk skirt, with an ’insertion,’ also of white silk, in the\ncleft of her low-necked bodice, in which were fastened a few more\ncattleyas.  She had scarcely recovered from the shock which the sight of\nSwann had given her, when some obstacle made the horse start to one side.\nThey were thrown forward from their seats; she uttered a cry, and fell\nback quivering and breathless.",
        "“It’s all right,” he assured her, “don’t be frightened.” And he slipped\nhis arm round her shoulder, supporting her body against his own; then went\non: “Whatever you do, don’t utter a word; just make a sign, yes or no, or\nyou’ll be out of breath again. You won’t mind if I put the flowers\nstraight on your bodice; the jolt has loosened them. I’m afraid of their\ndropping out; I’m just going to fasten them a little more securely.”",
        "She was not used to being treated with so much formality by men, and\nsmiled as she answered: “No, not at all; I don’t mind in the least.”",
        "But he, chilled a little by her answer, perhaps, also, to bear out the\npretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem, or even\nbecause he was already beginning to believe that he had been, exclaimed:\n\"No, no; you mustn’t speak. You will be out of breath again. You can\neasily answer in signs; I shall understand. Really and truly now, you\ndon’t mind my doing this? Look, there is a little–I think it must be\npollen, spilt over your dress,–may I brush it off with my hand? That’s\nnot too hard; I’m not hurting you, am I? I’m tickling you, perhaps, a\nlittle; but I don’t want to touch the velvet in case I rub it the wrong\nway. But, don’t you see, I really had to fasten the flowers; they would\nhave fallen out if I hadn’t.  Like that, now; if I just push them a little\nfarther down.... Seriously, I’m not annoying you, am I? And if I just\nsniff them to see whether they’ve really lost all their scent? I don’t\nbelieve I ever smelt any before; may I?  Tell the truth, now.”",
        "Still smiling, she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly, as who should\nsay, “You’re quite mad; you know very well that I like it.”",
        "He slipped his other hand upwards along Odette’s cheek; she fixed her eyes\non him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women of the\nold Florentine’s paintings, in whose faces he had found the type of hers;\nswimming at the brink of her fringed lids, her brilliant eyes, large and\nfinely drawn as theirs, seemed on the verge of breaking from her face and\nrolling down her cheeks like two great tears. She bent her neck, as all\ntheir necks may be seen to bend, in the pagan scenes as well as in the\nscriptural. And although her attitude was, doubtless, habitual and\ninstinctive, one which she knew to be appropriate to such moments, and was\ncareful not to forget to assume, she seemed to need all her strength to\nhold her face back, as though some invisible force were drawing it down\ntowards Swann’s. And Swann it was who, before she allowed her face, as\nthough despite her efforts, to fall upon his lips, held it back for a\nmoment longer, at a little distance between his hands. He had intended to\nleave time for her mind to overtake her body’s movements, to recognise the\ndream which she had so long cherished and to assist at its realisation,\nlike a mother invited as a spectator when a prize is given to the child\nwhom she has reared and loves. Perhaps, moreover, Swann himself was fixing\nupon these features of an Odette not yet possessed, not even kissed by\nhim, on whom he was looking now for the last time, that comprehensive gaze\nwith which, on the day of his departure, a traveller strives to bear away\nwith him in memory the view of a country to which he may never return.",
        "But he was so shy in approaching her that, after this evening which had\nbegun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete\nsurrender, whether from fear of chilling her, or from reluctance to\nappear, even retrospectively, to have lied, or perhaps because he lacked\nthe audacity to formulate a more urgent requirement than this (which could\nalways be repeated, since it had not annoyed her on the first occasion),\nhe resorted to the same pretext on the following days. If she had any\ncattleyas pinned to her bodice, he would say: “It is most unfortunate; the\ncattleyas don’t need tucking in this evening; they’ve not been disturbed\nas they were the other night; I think, though, that this one isn’t quite\nstraight. May I see if they have more scent than the others?” Or else, if\nshe had none: “Oh! no cattleyas this evening; then there’s nothing for me\nto arrange.” So that for some time there was no change from the procedure\nwhich he had followed on that first evening, when he had started by\ntouching her throat, with his fingers first and then with his lips, but\ntheir caresses began invariably with this modest exploration. And long\nafterwards, when the arrangement (or, rather, the ritual pretence of an\narrangement) of her cattleyas had quite fallen into desuetude, the\nmetaphor “Do a cattleya,” transmuted into a simple verb which they would\nemploy without a thought of its original meaning when they wished to refer\nto the act of physical possession (in which, paradoxically, the possessor\npossesses nothing), survived to commemorate in their vocabulary the long\nforgotten custom from which it sprang. And yet possibly this particular\nmanner of saying “to make love” had not the precise significance of its\nsynonyms. However disillusioned we may be about women, however we may\nregard the possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable\nand monotonous experience, every detail of which is known and can be\ndescribed in advance, it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure if\nthe women concerned be–or be thought to be–so difficult as to oblige us\nto base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our relations with\nthem, as was originally for Swann the arrangement of the cattleyas. He\ntrembled as he hoped, that evening, (but Odette, he told himself, if she\nwere deceived by his stratagem, could not guess his intention) that it was\nthe possession of this woman that would emerge for him from their large\nand richly coloured petals; and the pleasure which he already felt, and\nwhich Odette tolerated, he thought, perhaps only because she was not yet\naware of it herself, seemed to him for that reason–as it might have\nseemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid the flowers of the earthly\nparadise–a pleasure which had never before existed, which he was striving\nnow to create, a pleasure–and the special name which he was to give to it\npreserved its identity–entirely individual and new.",
        "The ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must\nfollow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her\ndressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before\nthe eyes of his coachman, saying: “What on earth does it matter what\npeople see?” And on evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins’ (which\nhappened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting Odette\nelsewhere), when–more and more rarely–he went into society, she would\nbeg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. The\nseason was spring, the nights clear and frosty. He would come away from an\nevening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees, tell\nthe friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on his\ngoing home with them, that he could not, that he was not going in their\ndirection; then the coachman would start off at a fast trot without\nfurther orders, knowing quite well where he had to go. His friends would\nbe left marvelling, and, as a matter of fact, Swann was no longer the same\nman.  No one ever received a letter from him now demanding an introduction\nto a woman. He had ceased to pay any attention to women, and kept away\nfrom the places in which they were ordinarily to be met. In a restaurant,\nor in the country, his manner was deliberately and directly the opposite\nof that by which, only a few days earlier, his friends would have\nrecognised him, that manner which had seemed permanently and unalterably\nhis own. To such an extent does passion manifest itself in us as a\ntemporary and distinct character, which not only takes the place of our\nnormal character but actually obliterates the signs by which that\ncharacter has hitherto been discernible. On the other hand, there was one\nthing that was, now, invariable, namely that wherever Swann might be\nspending the evening, he never failed to go on afterwards to Odette. The\ninterval of space separating her from him was one which he must as\ninevitably traverse as he must descend, by an irresistible gravitation,\nthe steep slope of life itself.  To be frank, as often as not, when he had\nstayed late at a party, he would have preferred to return home at once,\nwithout going so far out of his way, and to postpone their meeting until\nthe morrow; but the very fact of his putting himself to such inconvenience\nat an abnormal hour in order to visit her, while he guessed that his\nfriends, as he left them, were saying to one another: “He is tied hand and\nfoot; there must certainly be a woman somewhere who insists on his going\nto her at all hours,” made him feel that he was leading the life of the\nclass of men whose existence is coloured by a love-affair, and in whom the\nperpetual sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their\npractical interests has engendered a spiritual charm. Then, though he may\nnot consciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she\nwas waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that\nhe would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish,\nforgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which\nhe had felt on the evening when Odette had left the Verdurins’ before his\narrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable that it\nmight even be called a state of happiness.  Perhaps it was to that hour of\nanguish that there must be attributed the importance which Odette had\nsince assumed in his life. Other people are, as a rule, so immaterial to\nus that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the power to cause so\nmuch suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person seems at once to\nbelong to a different universe, is surrounded with poetry, makes of our\nlives a vast expanse, quick with sensation, on which that person and\nourselves are ever more or less in contact. Swann could not without\nanxiety ask himself what Odette would mean to him in the years that were\nto come. Sometimes, as he looked up from his victoria on those fine and\nfrosty nights of early spring, and saw the dazzling moonbeams fall between\nhis eyes and the deserted streets, he would think of that other face,\ngleaming and faintly roseate like the moon’s, which had, one day, risen on\nthe horizon of his mind and since then had shed upon the world that\nmysterious light in which he saw it bathed. If he arrived after the hour\nat which Odette sent her servants to bed, before ringing the bell at the\ngate of her little garden, he would go round first into the other street,\nover which, at the ground-level, among the windows (all exactly alike, but\ndarkened) of the adjoining houses, shone the solitary lighted window of\nher room. He would rap upon the pane, and she would hear the signal, and\nanswer, before running to meet him at the gate. He would find, lying open\non the piano, some of her favourite music, the Valse des Roses, the\nPauvre Fou of Tagliafico (which, according to the instructions embodied\nin her will, was to be played at her funeral); but he would ask her,\ninstead, to give him the little phrase from Vinteuil’s sonata. It was true\nthat Odette played vilely, but often the fairest impression that remains\nin our minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble of\nwrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano. The little\nphrase was associated still, in Swann’s mind, with his love for Odette. He\nfelt clearly that this love was something to which there were no\ncorresponding external signs, whose meaning could not be proved by any but\nhimself; he realised, too, that Odette’s qualities were not such as to\njustify his setting so high a value on the hours he spent in her company.\nAnd often, when the cold government of reason stood unchallenged, he would\nreadily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his intellectual and social\ninterests to this imaginary pleasure. But the little phrase, as soon as it\nstruck his ear, had the power to liberate in him the room that was needed\nto contain it; the proportions of Swann’s soul were altered; a margin was\nleft for a form of enjoyment which corresponded no more than his love for\nOdette to any external object, and yet was not, like his enjoyment of that\nlove, purely individual, but assumed for him an objective reality superior\nto that of other concrete things. This thirst for an untasted charm, the\nlittle phrase would stimulate it anew in him, but without bringing him\nany definite gratification to assuage it. With the result that those parts\nof Swann’s soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care for\nmaterial interests, those human considerations which affect all men alike,\nwere left bare by it, blank pages on which he was at liberty to inscribe\nthe name of Odette.  Moreover, where Odette’s affection might seem ever so\nlittle abrupt and disappointing, the little phrase would come to\nsupplement it, to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence. Watching\nSwann’s face while he listened to the phrase, one would have said that he\nwas inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe more deeply. And\nthe pleasure which the music gave him, which was shortly to create in him\na real longing, was in fact closely akin, at such moments, to the pleasure\nwhich he would have derived from experimenting with perfumes, from\nentering into contract with a world for which we men were not created,\nwhich appears to lack form because our eyes cannot perceive it, to lack\nsignificance because it escapes our intelligence, to which we may attain\nby way of one sense only. Deep repose, mysterious refreshment for\nSwann,–for him whose eyes, although delicate interpreters of painting,\nwhose mind, although an acute observer of manners, must bear for ever the\nindelible imprint of the barrenness of his life,–to feel himself\ntransformed into a creature foreign to humanity, blinded, deprived of his\nlogical faculty, almost a fantastic unicorn, a chimaera-like creature\nconscious of the world through his two ears alone. And as,\nnotwithstanding, he sought in the little phrase for a meaning to which his\nintelligence could not descend, with what a strange frenzy of intoxication\nmust he strip bare his innermost soul of the whole armour of reason, and\nmake it pass, unattended, through the straining vessel, down into the dark\nfilter of sound. He began to reckon up how much that was painful, perhaps\neven how much secret and unappeased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the\nphrase; and yet to him it brought no suffering. What matter though the\nphrase repeated that love is frail and fleeting, when his love was so\nstrong! He played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused, he felt\nit stealing over him, but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened\nhis sense of his own happiness.  He would make Odette play him the phrase\nagain, ten, twenty times on end, insisting that, while she played, she\nmust never cease to kiss him.  Every kiss provokes another. Ah, in those\nearliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life. How\nclosely, in their abundance, are they pressed one against another; until\nlovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour, as\nto count the flowers in a meadow in May. Then she would pretend to stop,\nsaying: “How do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me? I can’t\ndo everything at once. Make up your mind what you want; am I to play the\nphrase or do you want to play with me?” Then he would become annoyed, and\nshe would burst out with a laugh which, was transformed, as it left her\nlips, and descended upon him in a shower of kisses. Or else she would look\nat him sulkily, and he would see once again a face worthy to figure in\nBotticelli’s ’Life of Moses,’ he would place it there, giving to Odette’s\nneck the necessary inclination; and when he had finished her portrait in\ndistemper, in the fifteenth century, on the wall of the Sixtine, the idea\nthat she was, none the less, in the room with him still, by the piano, at\nthat very moment, ready to be kissed and won, the idea of her material\nexistence, of her being alive, would sweep over him with so violent an\nintoxication that, with eyes starting from his head and jaws that parted\nas though to devour her, he would fling himself upon this Botticelli\nmaiden and kiss and bite her cheeks. And then, as soon as he had left the\nhouse, not without returning to kiss her once again, because he had\nforgotten to take away with him, in memory, some detail of her fragrance\nor of her features, while he drove home in his victoria, blessing the name\nof Odette who allowed him to pay her these daily visits, which, although\nthey could not, he felt, bring any great happiness to her, still, by\nkeeping him immune from the fever of jealousy–by removing from him every\npossibility of a fresh outbreak of the heart-sickness which had manifested\nitself in him that evening, when he had failed to find her at the\nVerdurins’–might help him to arrive, without any recurrence of those\ncrises, of which the first had been so distressing that it must also be\nthe last, at the termination of this strange series of hours in his life,\nhours almost enchanted, in the same manner as these other, following\nhours, in which he drove through a deserted Paris by the light of the\nmoon: noticing as he drove home that the satellite had now changed its\nposition, relatively to his own, and was almost touching the horizon;\nfeeling that his love, also, was obedient to these immutable laws of\nnature, he asked himself whether this period, upon which he had entered,\nwas to last much longer, whether presently his mind’s eye would cease to\nbehold that dear countenance, save as occupying a distant and diminished\nposition, and on the verge of ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its\ncharm. For Swann was finding in things once more, since he had fallen in\nlove, the charm that he had found when, in his adolescence, he had fancied\nhimself an artist; with this difference, that what charm lay in them now\nwas conferred by Odette alone. He could feel reawakening in himself the\ninspirations of his boyhood, which had been dissipated among the\nfrivolities of his later life, but they all bore, now, the reflection, the\nstamp of a particular being; and during the long hours which he now found\na subtle pleasure in spending at home, alone with his convalescent spirit,\nhe became gradually himself again, but himself in thraldom to another.",
        "He went to her only in the evenings, and knew nothing of how she spent her\ntime during the day, any more than he knew of her past; so little, indeed,\nthat he had not even the tiny, initial clue which, by allowing us to\nimagine what we do not know, stimulates a desire foreknowledge. And so he\nnever asked himself what she might be doing, or what her life had been.\nOnly he smiled sometimes at the thought of how, some years earlier, when\nhe still did not know her, some one had spoken to him of a woman who, if\nhe remembered rightly, must certainly have been Odette, as of a ’tart,’ a\n’kept’ woman, one of those women to whom he still attributed (having lived\nbut little in their company) the entire set of characteristics,\nfundamentally perverse, with which they had been, for many years, endowed\nby the imagination of certain novelists. He would say to himself that one\nhas, as often as not, only to take the exact counterpart of the reputation\ncreated by the world in order to judge a person fairly, when with such a\ncharacter he contrasted that of Odette, so good, so simple, so\nenthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals, so nearly incapable of not telling\nthe truth that, when he had once begged her, so that they might dine\ntogether alone, to write to Mme. Verdurin, saying that she was unwell, the\nnext day he had seen her, face to face with Mme. Verdurin, who asked\nwhether she had recovered, blushing, stammering, and, in spite of herself,\nrevealing in every feature how painful, what a torture it was to her to\nact a lie; and, while in her answer she multiplied the fictitious details\nof an imaginary illness, seeming to ask pardon, by her suppliant look and\nher stricken accents, for the obvious falsehood of her words.",
        "On certain days, however, though these came seldom, she would call upon\nhim in the afternoon, to interrupt his musings or the essay on Ver-meer to\nwhich he had latterly returned. His servant would come in to say that Mme.\nde Crécy was in the small drawing-room. He would go in search of her, and,\nwhen he opened the door, on Odette’s blushing countenance, as soon as she\ncaught sight of Swann, would appear–changing the curve of her lips, the\nlook in her eyes, the moulding of her cheeks–an all-absorbing smile. Once\nhe was left alone he would see again that smile, and her smile of the day\nbefore, another with which she had greeted him sometime else, the smile\nwhich had been her answer, in the carriage that night, when he had asked\nher whether she objected to his rearranging her cattleyas; and the life of\nOdette at all other times, since he knew nothing of it, appeared to him\nupon a neutral and colourless background, like those sheets of sketches by\nWatteau upon which one sees, here and there, in every corner and in all\ndirections, traced in three colours upon the buff paper, innumerable\nsmiles. But, once in a while, illuminating a chink of that existence which\nSwann still saw as a complete blank, even if his mind assured him that it\nwas not so, because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy\nit, some friend who knew them both, and suspecting that they were in love,\nhad not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least\nimportance, would describe Odette’s figure, as he had seen her, that very\nmorning, going on foot up the Rue Abbattucci, in a cape trimmed with\nskunks, wearing a Rembrandt hat, and a bunch of violets in her bosom. This\nsimple outline reduced Swann to utter confusion by enabling him suddenly\nto perceive that Odette had an existence which was not wholly subordinated\nto his own; he burned to know whom she had been seeking to fascinate by\nthis costume in which he had never seen her; he registered a vow to insist\nupon her telling him where she had been going at that intercepted moment,\nas though, in all the colourless life–a life almost nonexistent, since\nshe was then invisible to him–of his mistress, there had been but a\nsingle incident apart from all those smiles directed towards himself;\nnamely, her walking abroad beneath a Rembrandt hat, with a bunch of\nviolets in her bosom.",
        "Except when he asked her for Vinteuil’s little phrase instead of the\nValse des Roses, Swann made no effort to induce her to play the things\nthat he himself preferred, nor, in literature any more than in music, to\ncorrect the manifold errors of her taste. He fully realised that she was\nnot intelligent. When she said how much she would like him to tell her\nabout the great poets, she had imagined that she would suddenly get to\nknow whole pages of romantic and heroic verse, in the style of the Vicomte\nde Borelli, only even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she asked\nwhether he had been made to suffer by a woman, if it was a woman that had\ninspired him, and once Swann had told her that no one knew, she had lost\nall interest in that painter. She would often say: “I’m sure, poetry;\nwell, of course, there’d be nothing like it if it was all true, if the\npoets really believed the things they said. But as often as not you’ll\nfind there’s no one so mean and calculating as those fellows. I know\nsomething about poetry. I had a friend, once, who was in love with a poet\nof sorts. In his verses he never spoke of anything but love, and heaven,\nand the stars.  Oh! she was properly taken in! He had more than three\nhundred thousand francs out of her before he’d finished.” If, then, Swann\ntried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted, how one ought to\nappreciate poetry or painting, after a minute or two she would cease to\nlisten, saying: “Yes...  I never thought it would be like that.” And he\nfelt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to lie to her,\nassuring her that what he had said was nothing, that he had only touched\nthe surface, that he had not time to go into it all properly, that there\nwas more in it than that. Then she would interrupt with a brisk, “More in\nit? What?... Do tell me!”, but he did not tell her, for he realised how\npetty it would appear to her, and how different from what she had\nexpected, less sensational and less touching; he was afraid, too, lest,\ndisillusioned in the matter of art, she might at the same time be\ndisillusioned in the greater matter of love.",
        "With the result that she found Swann inferior, intellectually, to what she\nhad supposed. “You’re always so reserved; I can’t make you out.” She\nmarvelled increasingly at his indifference to money, at his courtesy to\neveryone alike, at the delicacy of his mind. And indeed it happens, often\nenough, to a greater man than Swann ever was, to a scientist or artist,\nwhen he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom he lives,\nthat the feeling in them which proves that they have been convinced of the\nsuperiority of his intellect is created not by any admiration for his\nideas–for those are entirely beyond them–but by their respect for what\nthey term his good qualities. There was also the respect with which Odette\nwas inspired by the thought of Swann’s social position, although she had\nno desire that he should attempt to secure invitations for herself.\nPerhaps she felt that such attempts would be bound to fail; perhaps,\nindeed, she feared lest, merely by speaking of her to his friends, he\nshould provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind. The fact remains that she\nhad consistently held him to his promise never to mention her name. Her\nreason for not wishing to go into society was, she had told him, a quarrel\nwhich she had had, long ago, with another girl, who had avenged herself by\nsaying nasty things about her. “But,” Swann objected, “surely, people\ndon’t all know your friend.” “Yes, don’t you see, it’s like a spot of oil;\npeople are so horrid.” Swann was unable, frankly, to appreciate this\npoint; on the other hand, he knew that such generalisations as “People are\nso horrid,” and “A word of scandal spreads like a spot of oil,” were\ngenerally accepted as true; there must, therefore, be cases to which they\nwere literally applicable.  Could Odette’s case be one of these? He teased\nhimself with the question, though not for long, for he too was subject to\nthat mental oppression which had so weighed upon his father, whenever he\nwas faced by a difficult problem. In any event, that world of society\nwhich concealed such terrors for Odette inspired her, probably, with no\nvery great longing to enter it, since it was too far removed from the\nworld which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear\nconception of it. At the same time, while in certain respects she had\nretained a genuine simplicity (she had, for instance, kept up a friendship\nwith a little dressmaker, now retired from business, up whose steep and\ndark and fetid staircase she clambered almost every day), she still\nthirsted to be in the fashion, though her idea of it was not altogether\nthat held by fashionable people. For the latter, fashion is a thing that\nemanates from a comparatively small number of leaders, who project it to a\nconsiderable distance–with more or less strength according as one is\nnearer to or farther from their intimate centre–over the widening circle\nof their friends and the friends of their friends, whose names form a sort\nof tabulated index. People ’in society’ know this index by heart, they are\ngifted in such matters with an erudition from which they have extracted a\nsort of taste, of tact, so automatic in its operation that Swann, for\nexample, without needing to draw upon his knowledge of the world, if he\nread in a newspaper the names of the people who had been guests at a\ndinner, could tell at once how fashionable the dinner had been, just as a\nman of letters, merely by reading a phrase, can estimate exactly the\nliterary merit of its author. But Odette was one of those persons (an\nextremely numerous class, whatever the fashionable world may think, and to\nbe found in every section of society) who do not share this knowledge, but\nimagine fashion to be something of quite another kind, which assumes\ndifferent aspects according to the circle to which they themselves belong,\nbut has the special characteristic–common alike to the fashion of which\nOdette used to dream and to that before which Mme. Cottard bowed–of being\ndirectly accessible to all. The other kind, the fashion of ’fashionable\npeople,’ is, it must be admitted, accessible also; but there are\ninevitable delays. Odette would say of some one: “He never goes to any\nplace that isn’t really smart.”",
        "And if Swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would answer,\nwith a touch of contempt, “Smart places! Why, good heavens, just fancy, at\nyour age, having to be told what the smart places are in Paris! What do\nyou expect me to say? Well, on Sunday mornings there’s the Avenue de\nl’Impératrice, and round the lake at five o’clock, and on Thursdays the\nEden-Théâtre, and the Hippodrome on Fridays; then there are the balls...”",
        "“What balls?”",
        "“Why, silly, the balls people give in Paris; the smart ones, I mean.  Wait\nnow, Herbinger, you know who I mean, the fellow who’s in one of the\njobbers’ offices; yes, of course, you must know him, he’s one of the\nbest-known men in Paris, that great big fair-haired boy who wears such\nswagger clothes; he always has a flower in his buttonhole and a\nlight-coloured overcoat with a fold down the back; he goes about with that\nold image, takes her to all the first-nights. Very well! He gave a ball\nthe other night, and all the smart people in Paris were there. I should\nhave loved to go! but you had to shew your invitation at the door, and I\ncouldn’t get one anywhere. After all, I’m just as glad, now, that I didn’t\ngo; I should have been killed in the crush, and seen nothing. Still, just\nto be able to say one had been to Herbinger’s ball. You know how vain I\nam! However, you may be quite certain that half the people who tell you\nthey were there are telling stories.... But I am surprised that you\nweren’t there, a regular ’tip-topper’ like you.”",
        "Swann made no attempt, however, to modify this conception of fashion;\nfeeling that his own came no nearer to the truth, was just as fatuous,\ndevoid of all importance, he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting it\nto his mistress, with the result that, after a few months, she ceased to\ntake any interest in the people to whose houses he went, except when they\nwere the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at race-meetings\nor first-nights at the theatre. She hoped that he would continue to\ncultivate such profitable acquaintances, but she had come to regard them\nas less smart since the day when she had passed the Marquise de\nVilleparisis in the street, wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet with\nstrings.",
        "“But she looks like a pew-opener, like an old charwoman, darling!  That a\nmarquise! Goodness knows I’m not a marquise, but you’d have to pay me a\nlot of money before you’d get me to go about Paris rigged out like that!”",
        "Nor could she understand Swann’s continuing to live in his house on the\nQuai d’Orléans, which, though she dared not tell him so, she considered\nunworthy of him.",
        "It was true that she claimed to be fond of ’antiques,’ and used to assume\na rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved to spend the\nwhole day ’rummaging’ in second-hand shops, hunting for ’bric-à-brac,’ and\nthings of the ’right date.’ Although it was a point of honour, to which\nshe obstinately clung, as though obeying some old family custom, that she\nshould never answer any questions, never give any account of what she did\nduring the daytime, she spoke to Swann once about a friend to whose house\nshe had been invited, and had found that everything in it was ’of the\nperiod.’ Swann could not get her to tell him what ’period’ it was. Only\nafter thinking the matter over she replied that it was ’mediaeval’; by\nwhich she meant that the walls were panelled. Some time later she spoke to\nhim again of her friend, and added, in the hesitating but confident tone\nin which one refers to a person whom one has met somewhere, at dinner, the\nnight before, of whom one had never heard until then, but whom one’s hosts\nseemed to regard as some one so celebrated and important that one hopes\nthat one’s listener will know quite well who is meant, and will be duly\nimpressed: “Her dining-room... is...  eighteenth century!” Incidentally,\nshe had thought it hideous, all bare, as though the house were still\nunfinished; women looked frightful in it, and it would never become the\nfashion. She mentioned it again, a third time, when she shewed Swann a\ncard with the name and address of the man who had designed the\ndining-room, and whom she wanted to send for, when she had enough money,\nto see whether he could not do one for her too; not one like that, of\ncourse, but one of the sort she used to dream of, one which,\nunfortunately, her little house would not be large enough to contain, with\ntall sideboards, Renaissance furniture and fireplaces like the Château at\nBlois. It was on this occasion that she let out to Swann what she really\nthought of his abode on the Quai d’Orléans; he having ventured the\ncriticism that her friend had indulged, not in the Louis XVI style, for,\nhe went on, although that was not, of course, done, still it might be made\ncharming, but in the ’Sham-Antique.’",
        "“You wouldn’t have her live, like you, among a lot of broken-down chairs\nand threadbare carpets!” she exclaimed, the innate respectability of the\nmiddle-class housewife rising impulsively to the surface through the\nacquired dilettantism of the ’light woman.’",
        "People who enjoyed ’picking-up’ things, who admired poetry, despised\nsordid calculations of profit and loss, and nourished ideals of honour and\nlove, she placed in a class by themselves, superior to the rest of\nhumanity.  There was no need actually to have those tastes, provided one\ntalked enough about them; when a man had told her at dinner that he loved\nto wander about and get his hands all covered with dust in the old\nfurniture shops, that he would never be really appreciated in this\ncommercial age, since he was not concerned about the things that\ninterested it, and that he belonged to another generation altogether, she\nwould come home saying: “Why, he’s an adorable creature; so sensitive! I\nhad no idea,” and she would conceive for him a strong and sudden\nfriendship. But, on the other hand, men who, like Swann, had these tastes\nbut did not speak of them, left her cold. She was obliged, of course, to\nadmit that Swann was most generous with his money, but she would add,\npouting: “It’s not the same thing, you see, with him,” and, as a matter of\nfact, what appealed to her imagination was not the practice of\ndisinterestedness, but its vocabulary.",
        "Feeling that, often, he could not give her in reality the pleasures of\nwhich she dreamed, he tried at least to ensure that she should be happy in\nhis company, tried not to contradict those vulgar ideas, that bad taste\nwhich she displayed on every possible occasion, which all the same he\nloved, as he could not help loving everything that came from her, which\neven fascinated him, for were they not so many more of those\ncharacteristic features, by virtue of which the essential qualities of the\nwoman emerged, and were made visible? And so, when she was in a happy mood\nbecause she was going to see the Reine Topaze, or when her eyes grew\nserious, troubled, petulant, if she was afraid of missing the flower-show,\nor merely of not being in time for tea, with muffins and toast, at the Rue\nRoyale tea-rooms, where she believed that regular attendance was\nindispensable, and set the seal upon a woman’s certificate of ’smartness,’\nSwann, enraptured, as all of us are, at times, by the natural behaviour of\na child, or by the likeness of a portrait, which appears to be on the\npoint of speaking, would feel so distinctly the soul of his mistress\nrising to fill the outlines of her face that he could not refrain from\ngoing across and welcoming it with his lips. “Oh, then, so little Odette\nwants us to take her to the flower-show, does she?  she wants to be\nadmired, does she? very well, we will take her there, we can but obey her\nwishes.” As Swann’s sight was beginning to fail, he had to resign himself\nto a pair of spectacles, which he wore at home, when working, while to\nface the world he adopted a single eyeglass, as being less disfiguring.\nThe first time that she saw it in his eye, she could not contain herself\nfor joy: “I really do think–for a man, that is to say–it is tremendously\nsmart! How nice you look with it! Every inch a gentleman.  All you want\nnow is a title!” she concluded, with a tinge of regret in her voice. He\nliked Odette to say these things, just as, if he had been in love with a\nBreton girl, he would have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her\nsay that she believed in ghosts. Always until then, as is common among men\nwhose taste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality,\na grotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would\naccord to either taste simultaneously; yielding to the seduction of works\nof art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose company he\nenjoyed them grew more illiterate and common, he would take a little\nservant-girl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some decadent\npiece which he had wished to see performed, or to an exhibition of\nimpressionist painting, with the conviction, moreover, that an\neducated, ’society’ woman would have understood them no better, but would\nnot have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily. But, now that he\nwas in love with Odette, all this was changed; to share her sympathies, to\nstrive to be one with her in spirit was a task so attractive that he tried\nto find satisfaction in the things that she liked, and did find a\npleasure, not only in copying her habits but in adopting her opinions,\nwhich was all the deeper because, as those habits and opinions sprang from\nno roots in her intelligence, they suggested to him nothing except that\nlove, for the sake of which he had preferred them to his own. If he went\nagain to Serge Panine, if he looked out for opportunities of going to\nwatch Olivier Métra conducting, it was for the pleasure of being initiated\ninto every one of the ideas in Odette’s mind, of feeling that he had an\nequal share in all her tastes. This charm of drawing him closer to her,\nwhich her favourite plays and pictures and places possessed, struck him as\nbeing more mysterious than the intrinsic charm of more beautiful things\nand places, which appealed to him by their beauty, but without recalling\nher.  Besides, having allowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to\ngrow faint, until his scepticism, as a finished ’man of the world,’ had\ngradually penetrated them unawares, he held (or at least he had held for\nso long that he had fallen into the habit of saying) that the objects\nwhich we admire have no absolute value in themselves, that the whole thing\nis a matter of dates and castes, and consists in a series of fashions, the\nmost vulgar of which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as\nthe most refined.  And as he had decided that the importance which Odette\nattached to receiving cards tot a private view was not in itself any more\nridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in\ngoing to luncheon with the Prince of Wales, so he did not think that the\nadmiration which she professed for Monte-Carlo or for the Righi was any\nmore unreasonable than his own liking for Holland (which she imagined as\nugly) and for Versailles (which bored her to tears). And so he denied\nhimself the pleasure of visiting those places, consoling himself with the\nreflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel, to like\nnothing that was not equally felt and liked by her.",
        "Like everything else that formed part of Odette’s environment, and was no\nmore, in a sense, than the means whereby he might see and talk to her more\noften, he enjoyed the society of the Verdurins. With them, since, at the\nheart of all their entertainments, dinners, musical evenings, games,\nsuppers in fancy dress, excursions to the country, theatre parties, even\nthe infrequent ’big evenings’ when they entertained ’bores,’ there were\nthe presence of Odette, the sight of Odette, conversation with Odette, an\ninestimable boon which the Verdurins, by inviting him to their house,\nbestowed on Swann, he was happier in the little ’nucleus’ than anywhere\nelse, and tried to find some genuine merit in each of its members,\nimagining that his tastes would lead him to frequent their society for the\nrest of his life. Never daring to whisper to himself, lest he should doubt\nthe truth of the suggestion, that he would always be in love with Odette,\nat least when he tried to suppose that he would always go to the\nVerdurins’ (a proposition which, a priori, raised fewer fundamental\nobjections on the part of his intelligence), he saw himself for the future\ncontinuing to meet Odette every evening; that did not, perhaps, come quite\nto the same thing as his being permanently in love with her, but for the\nmoment while he was in love with her, to feel that he would not, one day,\ncease to see her was all that he could ask.  “What a charming atmosphere!\"\nhe said to himself. “How entirely genuine life is to these people! They\nare far more intelligent, far more artistic, surely, than the people one\nknows. Mme. Verdurin, in spite of a few trifling exaggerations which are\nrather absurd, has a sincere love of painting and music! What a passion\nfor works of art, what anxiety to give pleasure to artists! Her ideas\nabout some of the people one knows are not quite right, but then their\nideas about artistic circles are altogether wrong! Possibly I make no\ngreat intellectual demands upon conversation, but I am perfectly happy\ntalking to Cottard, although he does trot out those idiotic puns. And as\nfor the painter, if he is rather unpleasantly affected when he tries to be\nparadoxical, still he has one of the finest brains that I have ever come\nacross. Besides, what is most important, one feels quite free there, one\ndoes what one likes without constraint or fuss. What a flow of humour\nthere is every day in that drawing-room! Certainly, with a few rare\nexceptions, I never want to go anywhere else again. It will become more\nand more of a habit, and I shall spend the rest of my life among them.”",
        "And as the qualities which he supposed to be an intrinsic part of the\nVerdurin character were no more, really, than their superficial reflection\nof the pleasure which had been enjoyed in their society by his love for\nOdette, those qualities became more serious, more profound, more vital, as\nthat pleasure increased. Since Mme. Verdurin gave Swann, now and then,\nwhat alone could constitute his happiness; since, on an evening when he\nfelt anxious because Odette had talked rather more to one of the party\nthan to another, and, in a spasm of irritation, would not take the\ninitiative by asking her whether she was coming home, Mme. Verdurin\nbrought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous\nexclamation: “Odette!  You’ll see M. Swann home, won’t you?\"; since, when\nthe summer holidays came, and after he had asked himself uneasily whether\nOdette might not leave Paris without him, whether he would still be able\nto see her every day, Mme. Verdurin was going to invite them both to spend\nthe summer with her in the country; Swann, unconsciously allowing\ngratitude and self-interest to filter into his intelligence and to\ninfluence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Mme. Verdurin was “a\ngreat and noble soul.” Should any of his old fellow-pupils in the Louvre\nschool of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist, “I’d a\nhundred times rather,” he would reply, “have the Verdurins.” And, with a\nsolemnity of diction which was new in him: “They are magnanimous\ncreatures, and magnanimity is, after all, the one thing that matters, the\none thing that gives us distinction here on earth. Look you, there are\nonly two classes of men, the magnanimous, and the rest; and I have reached\nan age when one has to take sides, to decide once and for all whom one is\ngoing to like and dislike, to stick to the people one likes, and, to make\nup for the time one has wasted with the others, never to leave them again\nas long as one lives. Very well!” he went on, with the slight emotion\nwhich a man feels when, even without being fully aware of what he is\ndoing, he says something, not because it is true but because he enjoys\nsaying it, and listens to his own voice uttering the words as though they\ncame from some one else, “The die is now cast; I have elected to love none\nbut magnanimous souls, and to live only in an atmosphere of magnanimity.\nYou ask me whether Mme. Verdurin is really intelligent. I can assure you\nthat she has given me proofs of a nobility of heart, of a loftiness of\nsoul, to which no one could possibly attain–how could they?–without a\ncorresponding loftiness of mind. Without question, she has a profound\nunderstanding of art. But it is not, perhaps, in that that she is most\nadmirable; every little action, ingeniously, exquisitely kind, which she\nhas performed for my sake, every friendly attention, simple little things,\nquite domestic and yet quite sublime, reveal a more profound comprehension\nof existence than all your textbooks of philosophy.”",
        "He might have reminded himself, all the same, that there were various old\nfriends of his family who were just as simple as the Verdurins, companions\nof his early days who were just as fond of art, that he knew other\n’great-hearted creatures,’ and that, nevertheless, since he had cast his\nvote in favour of simplicity, the arts, and magnanimity, he had entirely\nceased to see them. But these people did not know Odette, and, if they had\nknown her, would never have thought of introducing her to him.",
        "And so there was probably not, in the whole of the Verdurin circle, a\nsingle one of the ’faithful’ who loved them, or believed that he loved\nthem, as dearly as did Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin said that he was\nnot satisfied with Swann, he had not only expressed his own sentiments, he\nhad unwittingly discovered his wife’s. Doubtless Swann had too particular\nan affection for Odette, as to which he had failed to take Mme.  Verdurin\ndaily into his confidence; doubtless the very discretion with which he\navailed himself of the Verdurins’ hospitality, refraining, often, from\ncoming to dine with them for a reason which they never suspected, and in\nplace of which they saw only an anxiety on his part not to have to decline\nan invitation to the house of some ’bore’ or other; doubtless, also, and\ndespite all the precautions which he had taken to keep it from them, the\ngradual discovery which they were making of his brilliant position in\nsociety–doubtless all these things contributed to their general annoyance\nwith Swann. But the real, the fundamental reason was quite different.\nWhat had happened was that they had at once discovered in him a locked\ndoor, a reserved, impenetrable chamber in which he still professed\nsilently to himself that the Princesse de Sagan was not grotesque, and\nthat Cottard’s jokes were not amusing; in a word (and for all that he\nnever once abandoned his friendly attitude towards them all, or revolted\nfrom their dogmas), they had discovered an impossibility of imposing those\ndogmas upon him, of entirely converting him to their faith, the like of\nwhich they had never come across in anyone before. They would have\nforgiven his going to the houses of ’bores’ (to whom, as it happened, in\nhis heart of hearts he infinitely preferred the Verdurins and all their\nlittle ’nucleus’) had he consented to set a good example by openly\nrenouncing those ’bores’ in the presence of the ’faithful.’ But that was\nan abjuration which, as they well knew, they were powerless to extort.",
        "What a difference was there in a ’newcomer’ whom Odette had asked them to\ninvite, although she herself had met him only a few times, and on whom\nthey were building great hopes–the Comte de Forcheville! (It turned out\nthat he was nothing more nor less than the brother-in-law of Saniette, a\ndiscovery which filled all the ’faithful’ with amazement: the manners of\nthe old palaeographer were so humble that they had always supposed him to\nbe of a class inferior, socially, to their own, and had never expected to\nlearn that he came of a rich and relatively aristocratic family.) Of\ncourse, Forcheville was enormously the ’swell,’ which Swann was not or had\nquite ceased to be; of course, he would never dream of placing, as Swann\nnow placed, the Verdurin circle above any other. But he lacked that\nnatural refinement which prevented Swann from associating himself with the\ncriticisms (too obviously false to be worth his notice) that Mme. Verdurin\nlevelled at people whom he knew. As for the vulgar and affected tirades in\nwhich the painter sometimes indulged, the bag-man’s pleasantries which\nCottard used to hazard,–whereas Swann, who liked both men sincerely,\ncould easily find excuses for these without having either the courage or\nthe hypocrisy to applaud them, Forcheville, on the other hand, was on an\nintellectual level which permitted him to be stupified, amazed by the\ninvective (without in the least understanding what it all was about), and\nto be frankly delighted by the wit. And the very first dinner at the\nVerdurins’ at which Forcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all\nthe differences between them, made his qualities start into prominence and\nprecipitated the disgrace of Swann.",
        "There was, at this dinner, besides the usual party, a professor from the\nSorbonne, one Brichot, who had met M. and Mme. Verdurin at a\nwatering-place somewhere, and, if his duties at the university and his\nother works of scholarship had not left him with very little time to\nspare, would gladly have come to them more often. For he had that\ncuriosity, that superstitious outlook on life, which, combined with a\ncertain amount of scepticism with regard to the object of their studies,\nearn for men of intelligence, whatever their profession, for doctors who\ndo not believe in medicine, for schoolmasters who do not believe in Latin\nexercises, the reputation of having broad, brilliant, and indeed superior\nminds. He affected, when at Mme. Verdurin’s, to choose his illustrations\nfrom among the most topical subjects of the day, when he spoke of\nphilosophy or history, principally because he regarded those sciences as\nno more, really, than a preparation for life itself, and imagined that he\nwas seeing put into practice by the ’little clan’ what hitherto he had\nknown only from books; and also, perhaps, because, having had drilled into\nhim as a boy, and having unconsciously preserved, a feeling of reverence\nfor certain subjects, he thought that he was casting aside the scholar’s\ngown when he ventured to treat those subjects with a conversational\nlicence, which seemed so to him only because the folds of the gown still\nclung.",
        "Early in the course of the dinner, when M. de Forcheville, seated on the\nright of Mme. Verdurin, who, in the ’newcomer’s’ honour, had taken great\npains with her toilet, observed to her: “Quite original, that white\ndress,” the Doctor, who had never taken his eyes off him, so curious was\nhe to learn the nature and attributes of what he called a “de,” and was on\nthe look-out for an opportunity of attracting his attention, so as to come\ninto closer contact with him, caught in its flight the adjective\n’blanche’ and, his eyes still glued to his plate, snapped out,\n”Blanche? Blanche of Castile?” then, without moving his head, shot a\nfurtive glance to right and left of him, doubtful, but happy on the whole.\nWhile Swann, by the painful and futile effort which he made to smile,\ntestified that he thought the pun absurd, Forcheville had shewn at once\nthat he could appreciate its subtlety, and that he was a man of the world,\nby keeping within its proper limits a mirth the spontaneity of which had\ncharmed Mme. Verdurin.",
        "“What are you to say of a scientist like that?” she asked Forcheville.\n\"You can’t talk seriously to him for two minutes on end. Is that the sort\nof thing you tell them at your hospital?” she went on, turning to the\nDoctor. “They must have some pretty lively times there, if that’s the\ncase. I can see that I shall have to get taken in as a patient!”",
        "“I think I heard the Doctor speak of that wicked old humbug, Blanche of\nCastile, if I may so express myself. Am I not right, Madame?” Brichot\nappealed to Mme. Verdurin, who, swooning with merriment, her eyes tightly\nclosed, had buried her face in her two hands, from between which, now and\nthen, escaped a muffled scream.",
        "“Good gracious, Madame, I would not dream of shocking the reverent-minded,\nif there are any such around this table, sub rosa... I recognise,\nmoreover, that our ineffable and Athenian–oh, how infinitely\nAthenian–Republic is capable of honouring, in the person of that\nobscurantist old she-Capet, the first of our chiefs of police. Yes,\nindeed, my dear host, yes, indeed!” he repeated in his ringing voice,\nwhich sounded a separate note for each syllable, in reply to a protest by\nM.  Verdurin. “The Chronicle of Saint Denis, and the authenticity of its\ninformation is beyond question, leaves us no room for doubt on that point.\nNo one could be more fitly chosen as Patron by a secularising proletariat\nthan that mother of a Saint, who let him see some pretty fishy saints\nbesides, as Suger says, and other great St. Bernards of the sort; for with\nher it was a case of taking just what you pleased.”",
        "“Who is that gentleman?” Forcheville asked Mme. Verdurin. “He seems to\nspeak with great authority.”",
        "“What! Do you mean to say you don’t know the famous Brichot? Why, he’s\ncelebrated all over Europe.”",
        "“Oh, that’s Bréchot, is it?” exclaimed Forcheville, who had not quite\ncaught the name. “You must tell me all about him\"; he went on, fastening a\npair of goggle eyes on the celebrity. “It’s always interesting to meet\nwell-known people at dinner. But, I say, you ask us to very select parties\nhere. No dull evenings in this house, I’m sure.”",
        "“Well, you know what it is really,” said Mme. Verdurin modestly.  “They\nfeel safe here. They can talk about whatever they like, and the\nconversation goes off like fireworks. Now Brichot, this evening, is\nnothing.  I’ve seen him, don’t you know, when he’s been with me, simply\ndazzling; you’d want to go on your knees to him. Well, with anyone else\nhe’s not the same man, he’s not in the least witty, you have to drag the\nwords out of him, he’s even boring.”",
        "“That’s strange,” remarked Forcheville with fitting astonishment.",
        "A sort of wit like Brichot’s would have been regarded as out-and-out\nstupidity by the people among whom Swann had spent his early life, for all\nthat it is quite compatible with real intelligence. And the intelligence\nof the Professor’s vigorous and well-nourished brain might easily have\nbeen envied by many of the people in society who seemed witty enough to\nSwann. But these last had so thoroughly inculcated into him their likes\nand dislikes, at least in everything that pertained to their ordinary\nsocial existence, including that annex to social existence which belongs,\nstrictly speaking, to the domain of intelligence, namely, conversation,\nthat Swann could not see anything in Brichot’s pleasantries; to him they\nwere merely pedantic, vulgar, and disgustingly coarse. He was shocked,\ntoo, being accustomed to good manners, by the rude, almost barrack-room\ntone which this student-in-arms adopted, no matter to whom he was\nspeaking.  Finally, perhaps, he had lost all patience that evening as he\nwatched Mme.  Verdurin welcoming, with such unnecessary warmth, this\nForcheville fellow, whom it had been Odette’s unaccountable idea to bring\nto the house.  Feeling a little awkward, with Swann there also, she had\nasked him on her arrival: “What do you think of my guest?”",
        "And he, suddenly realising for the first time that Forcheville, whom he\nhad known for years, could actually attract a woman, and was quite a good\nspecimen of a man, had retorted: “Beastly!” He had, certainly, no idea of\nbeing jealous of Odette, but did not feel quite so happy as usual, and\nwhen Brichot, having begun to tell them the story of Blanche of Castile’s\nmother, who, according to him, “had been with Henry Plantagenet for years\nbefore they were married,” tried to prompt Swann to beg him to continue\nthe story, by interjecting “Isn’t that so, M. Swann?” in the martial\naccents which one uses in order to get down to the level of an\nunintelligent rustic or to put the ’fear of God’ into a trooper, Swann cut\nhis story short, to the intense fury of their hostess, by begging to be\nexcused for taking so little interest in Blanche of Castile, as he had\nsomething that he wished to ask the painter. He, it appeared, had been\nthat afternoon to an exhibition of the work of another artist, also a\nfriend of Mme. Verdurin, who had recently died, and Swann wished to find\nout from him (for he valued his discrimination) whether there had really\nbeen anything more in this later work than the virtuosity which had struck\npeople so forcibly in his earlier exhibitions.",
        "“From that point of view it was extraordinary, but it did not seem to me\nto be a form of art which you could call ’elevated,’” said Swann with a\nsmile.",
        "“Elevated... to the height of an Institute!” interrupted Cottard, raising\nhis arms with mock solemnity. The whole table burst out laughing.",
        "“What did I tell you?” said Mme. Verdurin to Forcheville. “It’s simply\nimpossible to be serious with him. When you least expect it, out he comes\nwith a joke.”",
        "But she observed that Swann, and Swann alone, had not unbent. For one\nthing he was none too well pleased with Cottard for having secured a laugh\nat his expense in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead of\nreplying in a way that might have interested Swann, as he would probably\nhave done had they been alone together, preferred to win the easy\nadmiration of the rest by exercising his wit upon the talent of their dead\nfriend.",
        "“I went up to one of them,” he began, “just to see how it was done; I\nstuck my nose into it. Yes, I don’t think! Impossible to say whether it\nwas done with glue, with soap, with sealing-wax, with sunshine, with\nleaven, with excrem...”",
        "“And one make twelve!” shouted the Doctor, wittily, but just too late, for\nno one saw the point of his interruption.",
        "“It looks as though it were done with nothing at all,” resumed the\npainter. “No more chance of discovering the trick than there is in the\n’Night Watch,’ or the ’Regents,’ and it’s even bigger work than either\nRembrandt or Hals ever did. It’s all there,–and yet, no, I’ll take my\noath it isn’t.”",
        "Then, just as singers who have reached the highest note in their compass,\nproceed to hum the rest of the air in falsetto, he had to be satisfied\nwith murmuring, smiling the while, as if, after all, there had been\nsomething irresistibly amusing in the sheer beauty of the painting: “It\nsmells all right; it makes your head go round; it catches your breath; you\nfeel ticklish all over–and not the faintest clue to how it’s done. The\nman’s a sorcerer; the thing’s a conjuring-trick, it’s a miracle,” bursting\noutright into laughter, “it’s dishonest!” Then stopping, solemnly raising\nhis head, pitching his voice on a double-bass note which he struggled to\nbring into harmony, he concluded, “And it’s so loyal!”",
        "Except at the moment when he had called it “bigger than the ’Night\nWatch,’” a blasphemy which had called forth an instant protest from Mme.\nVerdurin, who regarded the ’Night Watch’ as the supreme masterpiece of the\nuniverse (conjointly with the ’Ninth’ and the ’Samothrace’), and at the\nword “excrement,” which had made Forcheville throw a sweeping glance round\nthe table to see whether it was ’all right,’ before he allowed his lips to\ncurve in a prudish and conciliatory smile, all the party (save Swann) had\nkept their fascinated and adoring eyes fixed upon the painter.",
        "“I do so love him when he goes up in the air like that!” cried Mme.\nVerdurin, the moment that he had finished, enraptured that the table-talk\nshould have proved so entertaining on the very night that Forcheville was\ndining with them for the first time. “Hallo, you!” she turned to her\nhusband, “what’s the matter with you, sitting there gaping like a great\nanimal?  You know, though, don’t you,” she apologised for him to the\npainter, “that he can talk quite well when he chooses; anybody would think\nit was the first time he had ever listened to you. If you had only seen\nhim while you were speaking; he was just drinking it all in. And to-morrow\nhe will tell us everything you said, without missing a word.”",
        "“No, really, I’m not joking!” protested the painter, enchanted by the\nsuccess of his speech. “You all look as if you thought I was pulling your\nlegs, that it was just a trick. I’ll take you to see the show, and then\nyou can say whether I’ve been exaggerating; I’ll bet you anything you\nlike, you’ll come away more ’up in the air’ than I am!”",
        "“But we don’t suppose for a moment that you’re exaggerating; we only want\nyou to go on with your dinner, and my husband too. Give M. Biche some more\nsole, can’t you see his has got cold? We’re not in any hurry; you’re\ndashing round as if the house was on fire. Wait a little; don’t serve the\nsalad just yet.”",
        "Mme. Cottard, who was a shy woman and spoke but seldom, was not lacking,\nfor all that, in self-assurance when a happy inspiration put the right\nword in her mouth. She felt that it would be well received; the thought\ngave her confidence, and what she was doing was done with the object not\nso much of shining herself, as of helping her husband on in his career.\nAnd so she did not allow the word ’salad,’ which Mme. Verdurin had just\nuttered, to pass unchallenged.",
        "“It’s not a Japanese salad, is it?” she whispered, turning towards Odette.",
        "And then, in her joy and confusion at the combination of neatness and\ndaring which there had been in making so discreet and yet so unmistakable\nan allusion to the new and brilliantly successful play by Dumas, she broke\ndown in a charming, girlish laugh, not very loud, but so irresistible that\nit was some time before she could control it.",
        "“Who is that lady? She seems devilish clever,” said Forcheville.",
        "“No, it is not. But we will have one for you if you will all come to\ndinner on Friday.”",
        "“You will think me dreadfully provincial, sir,” said Mme. Cottard to\nSwann, “but, do you know, I haven’t been yet to this famous Francillon\nthat everybody’s talking about. The Doctor has been (I remember now, he\ntold me what a very great pleasure it had been to him to spend the evening\nwith you there) and I must confess, I don’t see much sense in spending\nmoney on seats for him to take me, when he’s seen the play already. Of\ncourse an evening at the Théâtre-Français is never wasted, really; the\nacting’s so good there always; but we have some very nice friends,” (Mme.\nCottard would hardly ever utter a proper name, but restricted herself to\n\"some friends of ours” or “one of my friends,” as being more\n’distinguished,’ speaking in an affected tone and with all the importance\nof a person who need give names only when she chooses) “who often have a\nbox, and are kind enough to take us to all the new pieces that are worth\ngoing to, and so I’m certain to see this Francillon sooner or later, and\nthen I shall know what to think. But I do feel such a fool about it, I\nmust confess, for, whenever I pay a call anywhere, I find everybody\ntalking–it’s only natural–about that wretched Japanese salad. Really and\ntruly, one’s beginning to get just a little tired of hearing about it,\"\nshe went on, seeing that Swann seemed less interested than she had hoped\nin so burning a topic. “I must admit, though, that it’s sometimes quite\namusing, the way they joke about it: I’ve got a friend, now, who is most\noriginal, though she’s really a beautiful woman, most popular in society,\ngoes everywhere, and she tells me that she got her cook to make one of\nthese Japanese salads, putting in everything that young M. Dumas says\nyou’re to put in, in the play. Then she asked just a few friends to come\nand taste it. I was not among the favoured few, I’m sorry to say. But she\ntold us all about it on her next ’day’; it seems it was quite horrible,\nshe made us all laugh till we cried. I don’t know; perhaps it was the way\nshe told it,” Mme. Cottard added doubtfully, seeing that Swann still\nlooked grave.",
        "And, imagining that it was, perhaps, because he had not been amused by\nFrancillon: “Well, I daresay I shall be disappointed with it, after all.\nI don’t suppose it’s as good as the piece Mme. de Crécy worships, Serge\nPanine. There’s a play, if you like; so deep, makes you think! But just\nfancy giving a receipt for a salad on the stage of the Théâtre-Français!\nNow, Serge Panine–! But then, it’s like everything that comes from the\npen of M. Georges Ohnet, it’s so well written. I wonder if you know the\nMaître des Forges, which I like even better than Serge Panine.”",
        "“Pardon me,” said Swann with polite irony, “but I can assure you that my\nwant of admiration is almost equally divided between those masterpieces.”",
        "“Really, now; that’s very interesting. And what don’t you like about them?\nWon’t you ever change your mind? Perhaps you think he’s a little too sad.\nWell, well, what I always say is, one should never argue about plays or\nnovels. Everyone has his own way of looking at things, and what may be\nhorrible to you is, perhaps, just what I like best.”",
        "She was interrupted by Forcheville’s addressing Swann. What had happened\nwas that, while Mme. Cottard was discussing Francillon, Forcheville had\nbeen expressing to Mme. Verdurin his admiration for what he called the\n\"little speech” of the painter. “Your friend has such a flow of language,\nsuch a memory!” he had said to her when the painter had come to a\nstandstill, “I’ve seldom seen anything like it. He’d make a first-rate\npreacher. By Jove, I wish I was like that. What with him and M. Bréchot\nyou’ve drawn two lucky numbers to-night; though I’m not so sure that,\nsimply as a speaker, this one doesn’t knock spots off the Professor. It\ncomes more naturally with him, less like reading from a book.  Of course,\nthe way he goes on, he does use some words that are a bit realistic, and\nall that; but that’s quite the thing nowadays; anyhow, it’s not often I’ve\nseen a man hold the floor as cleverly as that, ’hold the spittoon,’ as we\nused to say in the regiment, where, by the way, we had a man he rather\nreminds me of. You could take anything you liked–I don’t know what–this\nglass, say; and he’d talk away about it for hours; no, not this glass;\nthat’s a silly thing to say, I’m sorry; but something a little bigger,\nlike the battle of Waterloo, or anything of that sort, he’d tell you\nthings you simply wouldn’t believe. Why, Swann was in the regiment then;\nhe must have known him.”",
        "“Do you see much of M. Swann?” asked Mme. Verdurin.",
        "“Oh dear, no!” he answered, and then, thinking that if he made himself\npleasant to Swann he might find favour with Odette, he decided to take\nthis opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable friends,\nbut speaking as a man of the world himself, in a tone of good-natured\ncriticism, and not as though he were congratulating Swann upon some\nundeserved good fortune: “Isn’t that so, Swann? I never see anything of\nyou, do I?–But then, where on earth is one to see him? The creature\nspends all his time shut up with the La Trémoïlles, with the Laumes and\nall that lot!” The imputation would have been false at any time, and was\nall the more so, now that for at least a year Swann had given up going to\nalmost any house but the Verdurins’. But the mere names of families whom\nthe Verdurins did not know were received by them in a reproachful silence.\nM. Verdurin, dreading the painful impression which the mention of these\n’bores,’ especially when flung at her in this tactless fashion, and in\nfront of all the ’faithful,’ was bound to make on his wife, cast a covert\nglance at her, instinct with anxious solicitude. He saw then that in her\nfixed resolution to take no notice, to have escaped contact, altogether,\nwith the news which had just been addressed to her, not merely to remain\ndumb but to have been deaf as well, as we pretend to be when a friend who\nhas been in the wrong attempts to slip into his conversation some excuse\nwhich we should appear to be accepting, should we appear to have heard it\nwithout protesting, or when some one utters the name of an enemy, the very\nmention of whom in our presence is forbidden; Mme. Verdurin, so that her\nsilence should have the appearance, not of consent but of the unconscious\nsilence which inanimate objects preserve, had suddenly emptied her face of\nall life, of all mobility; her rounded forehead was nothing, now, but an\nexquisite study in high relief, which the name of those La Trémoïlles,\nwith whom Swann was always ’shut up,’ had failed to penetrate; her nose,\njust perceptibly wrinkled in a frown, exposed to view two dark cavities\nthat were, surely, modelled from life. You would have said that her\nhalf-opened lips were just about to speak. It was all no more, however,\nthan a wax cast, a mask in plaster, the sculptor’s design for a monument,\na bust to be exhibited in the Palace of Industry, where the public would\nmost certainly gather in front of it and marvel to see how the sculptor,\nin expressing the unchallengeable dignity of the Verdurins, as opposed to\nthat of the La Trémoïlles or Laumes, whose equals (if not, indeed, their\nbetters) they were, and the equals and betters of all other ’bores’ upon\nthe face of the earth, had managed to invest with a majesty that was\nalmost Papal the whiteness and rigidity of his stone. But the marble at\nlast grew animated and let it be understood that it didn’t do to be at all\nsqueamish if one went to that house, since the woman was always tipsy and\nthe husband so uneducated that he called a corridor a ’collidor’!",
        "“You’d need to pay me a lot of money before I’d let any of that lot set\nfoot inside my house,” Mme. Verdurin concluded, gazing imperially down on\nSwann.",
        "She could scarcely have expected him to capitulate so completely as to\necho the holy simplicity of the pianist’s aunt, who at once exclaimed: “To\nthink of that, now! What surprises me is that they can get anybody to go\nnear them; I’m sure I should be afraid; one can’t be too careful. How can\npeople be so common as to go running after them?”",
        "But he might, at least, have replied, like Forcheville: “Gad, she’s a\nduchess; there are still plenty of people who are impressed by that sort\nof thing,” which would at least have permitted Mme. Verdurin the final\nretort, “And a lot of good may it do them!” Instead of which, Swann merely\nsmiled, in a manner which shewed, quite clearly, that he could not, of\ncourse, take such an absurd suggestion seriously. M. Verdurin, who was\nstill casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife, could see with\nregret, and could understand only too well that she was now inflamed with\nthe passion of a Grand Inquisitor who cannot succeed in stamping out a\nheresy; and so, in the hope of bringing Swann round to a retractation (for\nthe courage of one’s opinions is always a form of calculating cowardice in\nthe eyes of the ’other side’), he broke in:",
        "“Tell us frankly, now, what you think of them yourself. We shan’t repeat\nit to them, you may be sure.”",
        "To which Swann answered: “Why, I’m not in the least afraid of the Duchess\n(if it is of the La Trémoïlles that you’re speaking). I can assure you\nthat everyone likes going to see her. I don’t go so far as to say that\nshe’s at all ’deep’–” he pronounced the word as if it meant something\nridiculous, for his speech kept the traces of certain mental habits which\nthe recent change in his life, a rejuvenation illustrated by his passion\nfor music, had inclined him temporarily to discard, so that at times he\nwould actually state his views with considerable warmth–\"but I am quite\nsincere when I say that she is intelligent, while her husband is\npositively a bookworm.  They are charming people.”",
        "His explanation was terribly effective; Mme. Verdurin now realised that\nthis one state of unbelief would prevent her ’little nucleus’ from ever\nattaining to complete unanimity, and was unable to restrain herself, in\nher fury at the obstinacy of this wretch who could not see what anguish\nhis words were causing her, but cried aloud, from the depths of her\ntortured heart, “You may think so if you wish, but at least you need not\nsay so to us.”",
        "“It all depends upon what you call intelligence.” Forcheville felt that it\nwas his turn to be brilliant. “Come now, Swann, tell us what you mean by\nintelligence.”",
        "“There,” cried Odette, “that’s one of the big things I beg him to tell me\nabout, and he never will.”",
        "“Oh, but...” protested Swann.",
        "“Oh, but nonsense!” said Odette.",
        "“A water-butt?” asked the Doctor.",
        "“To you,” pursued Forcheville, “does intelligence mean what they call\nclever talk; you know, the sort of people who worm their way into\nsociety?”",
        "“Finish your sweet, so that they can take your plate away!” said Mme.\nVerdurin sourly to Saniette, who was lost in thought and had stopped\neating.  And then, perhaps a little ashamed of her rudeness, “It doesn’t\nmatter; take your time about it; there’s no hurry; I only reminded you\nbecause of the others, you know; it keeps the servants back.”",
        "“There is,” began Brichot, with a resonant smack upon every syllable, “a\nrather curious definition of intelligence by that pleasing old anarchist\nFénelon...”",
        "“Just listen to this!” Mme. Verdurin rallied Forcheville and the Doctor.\n\"He’s going to give us Fénelon’s definition of intelligence. That’s\ninteresting.  It’s not often you get a chance of hearing that!”",
        "But Brichot was keeping Fénelon’s definition until Swann should have given\nhis own. Swann remained silent, and, by this fresh act of recreancy,\nspoiled the brilliant tournament of dialectic which Mme. Verdurin was\nrejoicing at being able to offer to Forcheville.",
        "“You see, it’s just the same as with me!” Odette was peevish. “I’m not at\nall sorry to see that I’m not the only one he doesn’t find quite up to his\nlevel.”",
        "“These de La Trémouailles whom Mme. Verdurin has exhibited to us as so\nlittle to be desired,” inquired Brichot, articulating vigorously, “are\nthey, by any chance, descended from the couple whom that worthy old snob,\nSévigné, said she was delighted to know, because it was so good for her\npeasants? True, the Marquise had another reason, which in her case\nprobably came first, for she was a thorough journalist at heart, and\nalways on the look-out for ’copy.’ And, in the journal which she used to\nsend regularly to her daughter, it was Mme. de La Trémouaille, kept\nwell-informed through all her grand connections, who supplied the foreign\npolitics.”",
        "“Oh dear, no. I’m quite sure they aren’t the same family,” said Mme.\nVerdurin desperately.",
        "Saniette who, ever since he had surrendered his untouched plate to the\nbutler, had been plunged once more in silent meditation, emerged finally\nto tell them, with a nervous laugh, a story of how he had once dined with\nthe Duc de La Trémoïlle, the point of which was that the Duke did not know\nthat George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann, who really liked\nSaniette, felt bound to supply him with a few facts illustrative of the\nDuke’s culture, which would prove that such ignorance on his part was\nliterally impossible; but suddenly he stopped short; he had realised, as\nhe was speaking, that Saniette needed no proof, but knew already that the\nstory was untrue for the simple reason that he had at that moment invented\nit. The worthy man suffered acutely from the Verdurins’ always finding him\nso dull; and as he was conscious of having been more than ordinarily\nmorose this evening, he had made up his mind that he would succeed in\nbeing amusing, at least once, before the end of dinner. He surrendered so\nquickly, looked so wretched at the sight of his castle in ruins, and\nreplied in so craven a tone to Swann, appealing to him not to persist in a\nrefutation which was already superfluous, “All right; all right; anyhow,\neven if I have made a mistake that’s not a crime, I hope,” that Swann\nlonged to be able to console him by insisting that the story was\nindubitably true and exquisitely funny. The Doctor, who had been\nlistening, had an idea that it was the right moment to interject “Se non\nè vero,” but he was not quite certain of the words, and was afraid of\nbeing caught out.",
        "After dinner, Forcheville went up to the Doctor. “She can’t have been at\nall bad looking, Mme. Verdurin; anyhow, she’s a woman you can really talk\nto; that’s all I want. Of course she’s getting a bit broad in the beam.\nBut Mme. de Crécy! There’s a little woman who knows what’s what, all\nright. Upon my word and soul, you can see at a glance she’s got the\nAmerican eye, that girl has. We are speaking of Mme. de Crécy,” he\nexplained, as M. Verdurin joined them, his pipe in his mouth. “I should\nsay that, as a specimen of the female form–”",
        "“I’d rather have it in my bed than a clap of thunder!” the words came\ntumbling from Cottard, who had for some time been waiting in vain until\nForcheville should pause for breath, so that he might get in his hoary old\njoke, a chance for which might not, he feared, come again, if the\nconversation should take a different turn; and he produced it now with\nthat excessive spontaneity and confidence which may often be noticed\nattempting to cover up the coldness, and the slight flutter of emotion,\ninseparable from a prepared recitation. Forcheville knew and saw the joke,\nand was thoroughly amused. As for M. Verdurin, he was unsparing of his\nmerriment, having recently discovered a way of expressing it by a symbol,\ndifferent from his wife’s, but equally simple and obvious. Scarcely had he\nbegun the movement of head and shoulders of a man who was ’shaking with\nlaughter’ than he would begin also to cough, as though, in laughing too\nviolently, he had swallowed a mouthful of smoke from his pipe. And by\nkeeping the pipe firmly in his mouth he could prolong indefinitely the\ndumb-show of suffocation and hilarity. So he and Mme. Verdurin (who, at\nthe other side of the room, where the painter was telling her a story, was\nshutting her eyes preparatory to flinging her face into her hands)\nresembled two masks in a theatre, each representing Comedy, but in a\ndifferent way.",
        "M. Verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of his\nmouth, for Cottard, having occasion to leave the room for a moment,\nmurmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated now\nwhenever he had to go to the place in question: “I must just go and see\nthe Duc d’Aumale for a minute,” so drolly, that M. Verdurin’s cough began\nall over again.",
        "“Now, then, take your pipe out of your mouth; can’t you see, you’ll choke\nif you try to bottle up your laughter like that,” counselled Mme.\nVerdurin, as she came round with a tray of liqueurs.",
        "“What a delightful man your husband is; he has the wit of a dozen!\"\ndeclared Forcheville to Mme. Cottard. “Thank you, thank you, an old\nsoldier like me can never say ’No’ to a drink.”",
        "“M. de Forcheville thinks Odette charming,” M. Verdurin told his wife.",
        "“Why, do you know, she wants so much to meet you again some day at\nluncheon. We must arrange it, but don’t on any account let Swann hear\nabout it. He spoils everything, don’t you know. I don’t mean to say that\nyou’re not to come to dinner too, of course; we hope to see you very\noften.  Now that the warm weather’s coming, we’re going to have dinner out\nof doors whenever we can. That won’t bore you, will it, a quiet little\ndinner, now and then, in the Bois? Splendid, splendid, that will be quite\ndelightful.  ...",
        "“Aren’t you going to do any work this evening, I say?” she screamed\nsuddenly to the little pianist, seeing an opportunity for displaying,\nbefore a ’newcomer’ of Forcheville’s importance, at once her unfailing wit\nand her despotic power over the ’faithful.’",
        "“M. de Forcheville was just going to say something dreadful about you,\"\nMme. Cottard warned her husband as he reappeared in the room.  And he,\nstill following up the idea of Forcheville’s noble birth, which had\nobsessed him all through dinner, began again with: “I am treating a\nBaroness just now, Baroness Putbus; weren’t there some Putbuses in the\nCrusades? Anyhow they’ve got a lake in Pomerania that’s ten times the size\nof the Place de la Concorde. I am treating her for dry arthritis; she’s a\ncharming woman. Mme. Verdurin knows her too, I believe.”",
        "Which enabled Forcheville, a moment later, finding himself alone with Mme.\nCottard, to complete his favourable verdict on her husband with: “He’s an\ninteresting man, too; you can see that he knows some good people. Gad! but\nthey get to know a lot of things, those doctors.”",
        "“D’you want me to play the phrase from the sonata for M. Swann?” asked the\npianist.",
        "“What the devil’s that? Not the sonata-snake, I hope!” shouted M. de\nForcheville, hoping to create an effect. But Dr. Cottard, who had never\nheard this pun, missed the point of it, and imagined that M. de\nForcheville had made a mistake. He dashed in boldly to correct it: “No,\nno. The word isn’t serpent-à-sonates, it’s serpent-à-sonnettes!” he\nexplained in a tone at once zealous, impatient, and triumphant.",
        "Forcheville explained the joke to him. The Doctor blushed.",
        "“You’ll admit it’s not bad, eh, Doctor?”",
        "“Oh! I’ve known it for ages.”",
        "Then they were silenced; heralded by the waving tremolo of the\nviolin-part, which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves above\nit–and as in a mountainous country, against the seeming immobility of a\nvertically falling torrent, one may distinguish, two hundred feet below,\nthe tiny form of a woman walking in the valley–the little phrase had just\nappeared, distant but graceful, protected by the long, gradual unfurling\nof its transparent, incessant and sonorous curtain. And Swann, in his\nheart of hearts, turned to it, spoke to it as to a confidant in the secret\nof his love, as to a friend of Odette who would assure him that he need\npay no attention to this Forcheville.",
        "“Ah! you’ve come too late!” Mme. Verdurin greeted one of the ’faithful,’\nwhose invitation had been only ’to look in after dinner,’ “we’ve been\nhaving a simply incomparable Brichot! You never heard such eloquence! But\nhe’s gone. Isn’t that so, M. Swann? I believe it’s the first time you’ve\nmet him,” she went on, to emphasize the fact that it was to her that Swann\nowed the introduction. “Isn’t that so; wasn’t he delicious, our Brichot?”",
        "Swann bowed politely.",
        "“No? You weren’t interested?” she asked dryly.",
        "“Oh, but I assure you, I was quite enthralled. He is perhaps a little too\nperemptory, a little too jovial for my taste. I should like to see him a\nlittle less confident at times, a little more tolerant, but one feels that\nhe knows a great deal, and on the whole he seems a very sound fellow.”",
        "The party broke up very late. Cottard’s first words to his wife were: “I\nhave rarely seen Mme. Verdurin in such form as she was to-night.”",
        "“What exactly is your Mme. Verdurin? A bit of a bad hat, eh?” said\nForcheville to the painter, to whom he had offered a ’lift.’ Odette\nwatched his departure with regret; she dared not refuse to let Swann take\nher home, but she was moody and irritable in the carriage, and, when he\nasked whether he might come in, replied, “I suppose so,” with an impatient\nshrug of her shoulders. When they had all gone, Mme. Verdurin said to her\nhusband: “Did you notice the way Swann laughed, such an idiotic laugh,\nwhen we spoke about Mme. La Trémoïlle?”",
        "She had remarked, more than once, how Swann and Forcheville suppressed the\nparticle ’de’ before that lady’s name. Never doubting that it was done on\npurpose, to shew that they were not afraid of a title, she had made up her\nmind to imitate their arrogance, but had not quite grasped what\ngrammatical form it ought to take. Moreover, the natural corruptness of\nher speech overcoming her implacable republicanism, she still said\ninstinctively “the de La Trémoïlles,” or, rather (by an abbreviation\nsanctified by the usage of music-hall singers and the writers of the\n’captions’ beneath caricatures, who elide the ’de’), “the d’La\nTrémoïlles,” but she corrected herself at once to “Madame La\nTrémoïlle.–The Duchess, as Swann calls her,” she added ironically, with\na smile which proved that she was merely quoting, and would not, herself,\naccept the least responsibility for a classification so puerile and\nabsurd.",
        "“I don’t mind saying that I thought him extremely stupid.”",
        "M. Verdurin took it up. “He’s not sincere. He’s a crafty customer, always\nhovering between one side and the other. He’s always trying to run with\nthe hare and hunt with the hounds. What a difference between him and\nForcheville. There, at least, you have a man who tells you straight out\nwhat he thinks. Either you agree with him or you don’t. Not like the other\nfellow, who’s never definitely fish or fowl. Did you notice, by the way,\nthat Odette seemed all out for Forcheville, and I don’t blame her, either.\nAnd then, after all, if Swann tries to come the man of fashion over us,\nthe champion of distressed Duchesses, at any rate the other man has got a\ntitle; he’s always Comte de Forcheville!” he let the words slip delicately\nfrom his lips, as though, familiar with every page of the history of that\ndignity, he were making a scrupulously exact estimate of its value, in\nrelation to others of the sort.",
        "“I don’t mind saying,” Mme. Verdurin went on, “that he saw fit to utter\nsome most venomous, and quite absurd insinuations against Brichot.\nNaturally, once he saw that Brichot was popular in this house, it was a\nway of hitting back at us, of spoiling our party. I know his sort, the\ndear, good friend of the family, who pulls you all to pieces on the stairs\nas he’s going away.”",
        "“Didn’t I say so?” retorted her husband. “He’s simply a failure; a poor\nlittle wretch who goes through life mad with jealousy of anything that’s\nat all big.”",
        "Had the truth been known, there was not one of the ’faithful’ who was not\ninfinitely more malicious than Swann; but the others would all take the\nprecaution of tempering their malice with obvious pleasantries, with\nlittle sparks of emotion and cordiality; while the least indication of\nreserve on Swann’s part, undraped in any such conventional formula as “Of\ncourse, I don’t want to say anything–” to which he would have scorned to\ndescend, appeared to them a deliberate act of treachery. There are certain\noriginal and distinguished authors in whom the least ’freedom of speech’\nis thought revolting because they have not begun by flattering the public\ntaste, and serving up to it the commonplace expressions to which it is\nused; it was by the same process that Swann infuriated M. Verdurin.  In\nhis case as in theirs it was the novelty of his language which led his\naudience to suspect the blackness of his designs.",
        "Swann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the\nVerdurins’, and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most rosy\nlight, through the admiring eyes of love.",
        "As a rule he made no appointments with Odette except for the evenings; he\nwas afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the day as\nwell; at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit, even for an hour, the\nplace that he held in her thoughts, and so was constantly looking out for\nan opportunity of claiming her attention, in any way that would not be\ndispleasing to her. If, in a florist’s or a jeweller’s window, a plant or\nan ornament caught his eye, he would at once think of sending them to\nOdette, imagining that the pleasure which the casual sight of them had\ngiven him would instinctively be felt, also, by her, and would increase\nher affection for himself; and he would order them to be taken at once to\nthe Rue La pérouse, so as to accelerate the moment in which, as she\nreceived an offering from him, he might feel himself, in a sense,\ntransported into her presence.  He was particularly anxious, always, that\nshe should receive these presents before she went out for the evening, so\nthat her sense of gratitude towards him might give additional tenderness\nto her welcome when he arrived at the Verdurins’, might even–for all he\nknew–if the shopkeeper made haste, bring him a letter from her before\ndinner, or herself, in person, upon his doorstep, come on a little\nextraordinary visit of thanks.  As in an earlier phase, when he had\nexperimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt upon her\ncharacter, he sought now by that of gratification to elicit from her fresh\nparticles of her intimate feelings, which she had never yet revealed.",
        "Often she was embarrassed by lack of money, and under pressure from a\ncreditor would come to him for assistance. He enjoyed this, as he enjoyed\neverything which could impress Odette with his love for herself, or merely\nwith his influence, with the extent of the use that she might make of him.\nProbably if anyone had said to him, at the beginning, “It’s your position\nthat attracts her,” or at this stage, “It’s your money that she’s really\nin love with,” he would not have believed the suggestion, nor would he\nhave been greatly distressed by the thought that people supposed her to be\nattached to him, that people felt them, to be united by any ties so\nbinding as those of snobbishness or wealth. But even if he had accepted\nthe possibility, it might not have caused him any suffering to discover\nthat Odette’s love for him was based on a foundation more lasting than\nmere affection, or any attractive qualities which she might have found in\nhim; on a sound, commercial interest; an interest which would postpone for\never the fatal day on which she might be tempted to bring their relations\nto an end. For the moment, while he lavished presents upon her, and\nperformed all manner of services, he could rely on advantages not\ncontained in his person, or in his intellect, could forego the endless,\nkilling effort to make himself attractive. And this delight in being a\nlover, in living by love alone, of the reality of which he was inclined to\nbe doubtful, the price which, in the long run, he must pay for it, as a\ndilettante in immaterial sensations, enhanced its value in his eyes–as\none sees people who are doubtful whether the sight of the sea and the\nsound of its waves are really enjoyable, become convinced that they\nare, as also of the rare quality and absolute detachment of their own\ntaste, when they have agreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an\nhotel, from which that sight and that sound may be enjoyed.",
        "One day, when reflections of this order had brought him once again to the\nmemory of the time when some one had spoken to him of Odette as of a\n’kept’ woman, and when, once again, he had amused himself with contrasting\nthat strange personification, the ’kept’ woman–an iridescent mixture of\nunknown and demoniacal qualities, embroidered, as in some fantasy of\nGustave Moreau, with poison-dripping flowers, interwoven with precious\njewels–with that Odette upon whose face he had watched the passage of the\nsame expressions of pity for a sufferer, resentment of an act of\ninjustice, gratitude for an act of kindness, which he had seen, in earlier\ndays, on his own mother’s face, and on the faces of friends; that Odette,\nwhose conversation had so frequently turned on the things that he himself\nknew better than anyone, his collections, his room, his old servant, his\nbanker, who kept all his title-deeds and bonds;–the thought of the banker\nreminded him that he must call on him shortly, to draw some money. And\nindeed, if, during the current month, he were to come less liberally to\nthe aid of Odette in her financial difficulties than in the month before,\nwhen he had given her five thousand francs, if he refrained from offering\nher a diamond necklace for which she longed, he would be allowing her\nadmiration for his generosity to decline, that gratitude which had made\nhim so happy, and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his\nlove for her (as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer) had itself\ndiminished. And then, suddenly, he asked himself whether that was not\nprecisely what was implied by ’keeping’ a woman (as if, in fact, that idea\nof ’keeping’ could be derived from elements not at all mysterious nor\nperverse, but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life, such as\nthat thousand-franc note, a familiar and domestic object, torn in places\nand mended with gummed paper, which his valet, after paying the household\naccounts and the rent, had locked up hi a drawer in the old writing-desk\nwhence he had extracted it to send it, with four others, to Odette) and\nwhether it was not possible to apply to Odette, since he had known her\n(for he never imagined for a moment that she could ever have taken a penny\nfrom anyone else, before), that title, which he had believed so wholly\ninapplicable to her, of ’kept’ woman. He could not explore the idea\nfurther, for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was, with him,\ncongenital, intermittent and providential, happened, at that moment, to\nextinguish every particle of light in his brain, as instantaneously as, at\na later period, when electric lighting had been everywhere installed, it\nbecame possible, merely by fingering a switch, to cut off all the supply\nof light from a house.  His mind fumbled, for a moment, in the darkness,\nhe took off his spectacles, wiped the glasses, passed his hands over his\neyes, but saw no light until he found himself face to face with a wholly\ndifferent idea, the realisation that he must endeavour, in the coming\nmonth, to send Odette six or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five,\nsimply as a surprise for her and to give her pleasure.",
        "In the evening, when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet\nOdette at the Verdurins’, or rather at one of the open-air restaurants\nwhich they liked to frequent in the Bois and especially at Saint-Cloud, he\nwould go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which, at one time,\nhe had been a constant guest. He did not wish to lose touch with people\nwho, for all that he knew, might be of use, some day, to Odette, and\nthanks to whom he was often, in the meantime, able to procure for her some\nprivilege or pleasure. Besides, he had been used for so long to the\nrefinement and comfort of good society that, side by side with his\ncontempt, there had grown up also a desperate need for it, with the result\nthat, when he had reached the point after which the humblest lodgings\nappeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely mansions, his\nsenses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he could not enter\nthe former without a feeling of acute discomfort. He had the same\nregard–to a degree of identity which they would never have suspected–for\nthe little families with small incomes who asked him to dances in their\nflats (\"straight upstairs to the fifth floor, and the door on the left”)\nas for the Princesse de Parme, who gave the most splendid parties in\nParis; but he had not the feeling of being actually ’at the ball’ when he\nfound himself herded with the fathers of families in the bedroom of the\nlady of the house, while the spectacle of wash-hand-stands covered over\nwith towels, and of beds converted into cloak-rooms, with a mass of hats\nand great-coats sprawling over their counterpanes, gave him the same\nstifling sensation that, nowadays, people who have been used for half a\nlifetime to electric light derive from a smoking lamp or a candle that\nneeds to be snuffed. If he were dining out, he would order his carriage\nfor half-past seven; while he changed his clothes, he would be wondering,\nall the time, about Odette, and in this way was never alone, for the\nconstant thought of Odette gave to the moments in which he was separated\nfrom her the same peculiar charm as to those in which she was at his side.\nHe would get into his carriage and drive off, but he knew that this\nthought had jumped in after him and had settled down upon his knee, like a\npet animal which he might take everywhere, and would keep with him at the\ndinner-table, unobserved by his fellow-guests.  He would stroke and fondle\nit, warm himself with it, and, as a feeling of languor swept over him,\nwould give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat\nand nostrils–a new experience, this,–as he fastened the bunch of\ncolumbines in his buttonhole. He had for some time been feeling neither\nwell nor happy, especially since Odette had brought Forcheville to the\nVerdurins’, and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in the\ncountry. But he could never summon up courage to leave Paris, even for a\nday, while Odette was there. The weather was warm; it was the finest part\nof the spring. And for all that he was driving through a city of stone to\nimmure himself in a house without grass or garden, what was incessantly\nbefore his eyes was a park which he owned, near Combray, where, at four in\nthe afternoon, before coming to the asparagus-bed, thanks to the breeze\nthat was wafted across the fields from Méséglise, he could enjoy the\nfragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an arbour of hornbeams in the\ngarden as by the bank of the pond, fringed with forget-me-not and iris;\nand where, when he sat down to dinner, trained and twined by the\ngardener’s skilful hand, there ran all about his table currant-bush and\nrose.",
        "After dinner, if he had an early appointment in the Bois or at\nSaint-Cloud, he would rise from table and leave the house so\nabruptly–especially if it threatened to rain, and so to scatter the\n’faithful’ before their normal time–that on one occasion the Princesse\ndes Laumes (at whose house dinner had been so late that Swann had left\nbefore the coffee came in, to join the Verdurins on the Island in the\nBois) observed:",
        "“Really, if Swann were thirty years older, and had diabetes, there might\nbe some excuse for his running away like that. He seems to look upon us\nall as a joke.”",
        "He persuaded himself that the spring-time charm, which he could not go\ndown to Combray to enjoy, he would find at least on the He des Cygnes or\nat Saint-Cloud. But as he could think only of Odette, he would return home\nnot knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young leaves, or if\nthe moon had been shining. He would be welcomed by the little phrase from\nthe sonata, played in the garden on the restaurant piano. If there was\nnone in the garden, the Verdurins would have taken immense pains to have a\npiano brought out either from a private room or from the restaurant\nitself; not because Swann was now restored to favour; far from it. But the\nidea of arranging an ingenious form of entertainment for some one, even\nfor some one whom they disliked, would stimulate them, during the time\nspent in its preparation, to a momentary sense of cordiality and\naffection. Now and then he would remind himself that another fine spring\nevening was drawing to a close, and would force himself to notice the\ntrees and the sky. But the state of excitement into which Odette’s\npresence never failed to throw him, added to a feverish ailment which, for\nsome time now, had scarcely left him, robbed him of that sense of quiet\nand comfort which is an indispensable background to the impressions that\nwe derive from nature.",
        "One evening, when Swann had consented to dine with the Verdurins, and had\nmentioned during dinner that he had to attend, next day, the annual\nbanquet of an old comrades’ association, Odette had at once exclaimed\nacross the table, in front of everyone, in front of Forcheville, who was\nnow one of the ’faithful,’ in front of the painter, in front of Cottard:",
        "“Yes, I know, you have your banquet to-morrow; I sha’n’t see you, then,\ntill I get home; don’t be too late.”",
        "And although Swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously, at\nOdette’s demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the ’faithful,’\nhe felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow, before them all,\nwith that calm immodesty, the fact that they saw each other regularly\nevery evening, his privileged position in her house, and her own\npreference for him which it implied. It was true that Swann had often\nreflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman; and in the\nsupremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to\nhimself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard it\nproclaimed to all the ’faithful’; but since he had observed that, to\nseveral other men than himself, Odette seemed a fascinating and desirable\nwoman, the attraction which her body held for him had aroused a painful\nlonging to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest particles of\nher heart. And he had begun to attach an incalculable value to those\nmoments passed in her house in the evenings, when he held her upon his\nknee, made her tell him what she thought about this or that, and counted\nover that treasure to which, alone of all his earthly possessions, he\nstill clung. And so, after this dinner, drawing her aside, he took care to\nthank her effusively, seeking to indicate to her by the extent of his\ngratitude the corresponding intensity of the pleasures which it was in her\npower to bestow on him, the supreme pleasure being to guarantee him\nimmunity, for as long as his love should last and he remain vulnerable,\nfrom the assaults of jealousy.",
        "When he came away from his banquet, the next evening, it was pouring rain,\nand he had nothing but his victoria. A friend offered to take him home in\na closed carriage, and as Odette, by the fact of her having invited him to\ncome, had given him an assurance that she was expecting no one else, he\ncould, with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart, rather than set off thus\nin the rain, have gone home and to bed. But perhaps, if she saw that he\nseemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every evening, without\nexception, in her company, she might grow careless, and fail to keep free\nfor him just the one evening on which he particularly desired it.",
        "It was after eleven when he reached her door, and as he made his apology\nfor having been unable to come away earlier, she complained that it was\nindeed very late; the storm had made her unwell, her head ached, and she\nwarned him that she would not let him stay longer than half an hour, that\nat midnight she would send him away; a little while later she felt tired\nand wished to sleep.",
        "“No cattleya, then, to-night?” he asked, “and I’ve been looking forward so\nto a nice little cattleya.”",
        "But she was irresponsive; saying nervously: “No, dear, no cattleya\ntonight.  Can’t you see, I’m not well?”",
        "“It might have done you good, but I won’t bother you.”",
        "She begged him to put out the light before he went; he drew the curtains\nclose round her bed and left her. But, when he was in his own house again,\nthe idea suddenly struck him that, perhaps, Odette was expecting some one\nelse that evening, that she had merely pretended to be tired, that she had\nasked him to put the light out only so that he should suppose that she was\ngoing to sleep, that the moment he had left the house she had lighted it\nagain, and had reopened her door to the stranger who was to be her guest\nfor the night. He looked at his watch. It was about an hour and a half\nsince he had left her; he went out, took a cab, and stopped it close to\nher house, in a little street running at right angles to that other\nstreet, which lay at the back of her house, and along which he used to go,\nsometimes, to tap upon her bedroom window, for her to let him in. He left\nhis cab; the streets were all deserted and dark; he walked a few yards and\ncame out almost opposite her house. Amid the glimmering blackness of all\nthe row of windows, the lights in which had long since been put out, he\nsaw one, and only one, from which overflowed, between the slats of its\nshutters, dosed like a wine-press over its mysterious golden juice, the\nlight that filled the room within, a light which on so many evenings, as\nsoon as he saw it, far off, as he turned into the street, had rejoiced his\nheart with its message: “She is there–expecting you,” and now tortured\nhim with: “She is there with the man she was expecting.” He must know who;\nhe tiptoed along by the wall until he reached the window, but between the\nslanting bars of the shutters he could see nothing; he could hear, only,\nin the silence of the night, the murmur of conversation. What agony he\nsuffered as he watched that light, in whose golden atmosphere were moving,\nbehind the closed sash, the unseen and detested pair, as he listened to\nthat murmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after\nhis own departure, the perfidy of Odette, and the pleasures which she was\nat that moment tasting with the stranger.",
        "And yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced\nhim to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its\nuncertainty, now that Odette’s other life, of which he had had, at that\nfirst moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost\nwithin his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light,\ncaught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into which,\nwhen he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or rather\nhe would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had come\nthere very late, and by that signal Odette would at least learn that he\nknew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while he\nhimself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him, as\nsharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been\ntricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in their\nerror, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they believed\nto be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a plan, there\nwith the knowledge that he was going, in another minute, to tap upon the\nshutter. And, perhaps, what he felt (almost an agreeable feeling) at that\nmoment was something more than relief at the solution of a doubt, at the\nsoothing of a pain; was an intellectual pleasure. If, since he had fallen\nin love, things had recovered a little of the delicate attraction that\nthey had had for him long ago–though only when a light was shed upon them\nby a thought, a memory of Odette–now it was another of the faculties,\nprominent in the studious days of his youth, that Odette had quickened\nwith new life, the passion for truth, but for a truth which, too, was\ninterposed between himself and his mistress, receiving its light from her\nalone, a private and personal truth the sole object of which (an\ninfinitely precious object, and one almost impersonal in its absolute\nbeauty) was Odette–Odette in her activities, her environment, her\nprojects, and her past. At every other period in his life, the little\neveryday words and actions of another person had always seemed wholly\nvalueless to Swann; if gossip about such things were repeated to him, he\nwould dismiss it as insignificant, and while he listened it was only the\nlowest, the most commonplace part of his mind that was interested; at such\nmoments he felt utterly dull and uninspired. But in this strange phase of\nlove the personality of another person becomes so enlarged, so deepened,\nthat the curiosity which he could now feel aroused in himself, to know the\nleast details of a woman’s daily occupation, was the same thirst for\nknowledge with which he had once studied history. And all manner of\nactions, from which, until now, he would have recoiled in shame, such as\nspying, to-night, outside a window, to-morrow, for all he knew, putting\nadroitly provocative questions to casual witnesses, bribing servants,\nlistening at doors, seemed to him, now, to be precisely on a level with\nthe deciphering of manuscripts, the weighing of evidence, the\ninterpretation of old monuments, that was to say, so many different\nmethods of scientific investigation, each one having a definite\nintellectual value and being legitimately employable in the search for\ntruth.",
        "As his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at the\nthought that Odette would now know that he had suspected her, that he had\nreturned, that he had posted himself outside her window. She had often\ntold him what a horror she had of jealous men, of lovers who spied.  What\nhe was going to do would be extremely awkward, and she would detest him\nfor ever after, whereas now, for the moment, for so long as he refrained\nfrom knocking, perhaps even in the act of infidelity, she loved him still.\nHow often is not the prospect of future happiness thus sacrificed to one’s\nimpatient insistence upon an immediate gratification. But his desire to\nknow the truth was stronger, and seemed to him nobler than his desire for\nher. He knew that the true story of certain events, which he would have\ngiven his life to be able to reconstruct accurately and in full, was to be\nread within that window, streaked with bars of light, as within the\nilluminated, golden boards of one of those precious manuscripts, by whose\nwealth of artistic treasures the scholar who consults them cannot remain\nunmoved. He yearned for the satisfaction of knowing the truth which so\nimpassioned him in that brief, fleeting, precious transcript, on that\ntranslucent page, so warm, so beautiful. And besides, the advantage which\nhe felt–which he so desperately wanted to feel–that he had over them,\nlay perhaps not so much in knowing as in being able to shew them that he\nknew. He drew himself up on tiptoe. He knocked. They had not heard; he\nknocked again; louder; their conversation ceased. A man’s voice–he\nstrained his ears to distinguish whose, among such of Odette’s friends as\nhe knew, the voice could be–asked:",
        "“Who’s that?”",
        "He could not be certain of the voice. He knocked once again. The window\nfirst, then the shutters were thrown open. It was too late, now, to\nretire, and since she must know all, so as not to seem too contemptible,\ntoo jealous and inquisitive, he called out in a careless, hearty,\nwelcoming tone:",
        "“Please don’t bother; I just happened to be passing, and saw the light.  I\nwanted to know if you were feeling better.”",
        "He looked up. Two old gentlemen stood facing him, in the window, one of\nthem with a lamp in his hand; and beyond them he could see into the room,\na room that he had never seen before. Having fallen into the habit, When\nhe came late to Odette, of identifying her window by the fact that it was\nthe only one still lighted in a row of windows otherwise all alike, he had\nbeen misled, this time, by the light, and had knocked at the window beyond\nhers, in the adjoining house. He made what apology he could and hurried\nhome, overjoyed that the satisfaction of his curiosity had preserved their\nlove intact, and that, having feigned for so long, when in Odette’s\ncompany, a sort of indifference, he had not now, by a demonstration of\njealousy, given her that proof of the excess of his own passion which, in\na pair of lovers, fully and finally dispenses the recipient from the\nobligation to love the other enough. He never spoke to her of this\nmisadventure, he ceased even to think of it himself. But now and then his\nthoughts in their wandering course would come upon this memory where it\nlay unobserved, would startle it into life, thrust it more deeply down\ninto his consciousness, and leave him aching with a sharp, far-rooted\npain. As though this had been a bodily pain, Swann’s mind was powerless to\nalleviate it; in the case of bodily pain, however, since it is independent\nof the mind, the mind can dwell upon it, can note that it has diminished,\nthat it has momentarily ceased. But with this mental pain, the mind,\nmerely by recalling it, created it afresh. To determine not to think of it\nwas but to think of it still, to suffer from it still. And when, in\nconversation with his friends, he forgot his sufferings, suddenly a word\ncasually uttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does\nwhen a clumsy hand has touched his aching limb. When he came away from\nOdette, he was happy, he felt calm, he recalled the smile with which, in\ngentle mockery, she had spoken to him of this man or of that, a smile\nwhich was all tenderness for himself; he recalled the gravity of her head\nwhich she seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall, as\nthough against her will, upon his lips, as she had done on that first\nevening in the carriage; her languishing gaze at him while she lay\nnestling in his arms, her bended head seeming to recede between her\nshoulders, as though shrinking from the cold.",
        "But then, at once, his jealousy, as it had been the shadow of his love,\npresented him with the complement, with the converse of that new smile\nwith which she had greeted him that very evening,–with which, now,\nperversely, she was mocking Swann while she tendered her love to another\n–of that lowering of her head, but lowered now to fall on other lips, and\n(but bestowed upon a stranger) of all the marks of affection that she had\nshewn to him. And all these voluptuous memories which he bore away from\nher house were, as one might say, but so many sketches, rough plans, like\nthe schemes of decoration which a designer submits to one in outline,\nenabling Swann to form an idea of the various attitudes, aflame or faint\nwith passion, which she was capable of adopting for others. With the\nresult that he came to regret every pleasure that he tasted in her\ncompany, every new caress that he invented (and had been so imprudent as\nto point out to her how delightful it was), every fresh charm that he\nfound in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they would go to enrich\nthe collection of instruments in his secret torture-chamber.",
        "A fresh turn was given to the screw when Swann recalled a sudden\nexpression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the first\ntime, in Odette’s eyes. It was after dinner at the Verdurins’. Whether it\nwas because Forcheville, aware that Saniette, his brother-in-law, was not\nin favour with them, had decided to make a butt of him, and to shine at\nhis expense, or because he had been annoyed by some awkward remark which\nSaniette had made to him, although it had passed unnoticed by the rest of\nthe party who knew nothing of whatever tactless allusion it might conceal,\nor possibly because he had been for some time looking out for an\nopportunity of securing the expulsion from the house of a fellow-guest who\nknew rather too much about him, and whom he knew to be so nice-minded that\nhe himself could not help feeling embarrassed at times merely by his\npresence in the room, Forcheville replied to Saniette’s tactless utterance\nwith such a volley of abuse, going out of his way to insult him,\nemboldened, the louder he shouted, by the fear, the pain, the entreaties\nof his victim, that the poor creature, after asking Mme. Verdurin whether\nhe should stay and receiving no answer, had left the house in stammering\nconfusion and with tears in his eyes. Odette had looked on, impassive, at\nthis scene; but when the door had closed behind Saniette, she had forced\nthe normal expression of her face down, as the saying is, by several pegs,\nso as to bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as Forcheville;\nher eyes had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his\naudacity, of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim;\nshe had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime, which so clearly\nimplied: “That’s finished him off, or I’m very much mistaken. Did you see\nwhat a fool he looked? He was actually crying,” that Forcheville, when his\neyes met hers, sobered in a moment from the anger, or pretended anger with\nwhich he was still flushed, smiled as he explained: “He need only have\nmade himself pleasant and he’d have been here still; a good scolding does\na man no harm, at any time.”",
        "One day when Swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call, and\nhad failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see, it occurred\nto him to go, instead, to Odette, at an hour when, although he never went\nto her house then as a rule, he knew that she was always at home, resting\nor writing letters until tea-time, and would enjoy seeing her for a\nmoment, if it did not disturb her. The porter told him that he believed\nOdette to be in; Swann rang the bell, thought that he heard a sound, that\nhe heard footsteps, but no one came to the door. Anxious and annoyed, he\nwent round to the other little street, at the back of her house, and stood\nbeneath her bedroom window; the curtains were drawn and he could see\nnothing; he knocked loudly upon the pane, he shouted; still no one came.\nHe could see that the neighbours were staring at him. He turned away,\nthinking that, after all, he had perhaps been mistaken in believing that\nhe heard footsteps; but he remained so preoccupied with the suspicion that\nhe could turn his mind to nothing else. After waiting for an hour, he\nreturned.  He found her at home; she told him that she had been in the\nhouse when he rang, but had been asleep; the bell had awakened her; she\nhad guessed that it must be Swann, and had run out to meet him, but he had\nalready gone. She had, of course, heard him knocking at the window.  Swann\ncould at once detect in this story one of those fragments of literal truth\nwhich liars, when taken by surprise, console themselves by introducing\ninto the composition of the falsehood which they have to invent, thinking\nthat it can be safely incorporated, and will lend the whole story an air\nof verisimilitude. It was true that, when Odette had just done something\nwhich she did not wish to disclose, she would take pains to conceal it in\na secret place in her heart. But as soon as she found herself face to face\nwith the man to whom she was obliged to lie, she became uneasy, all her\nideas melted like wax before a flame, her inventive and her reasoning\nfaculties were paralysed, she might ransack her brain but would find only\na void; still, she must say something, and there lay within her reach\nprecisely the fact which she had wished to conceal, which, being the\ntruth, was the one thing that had remained. She broke off from it a tiny\nfragment, of no importance in itself, assuring herself that, after all, it\nwas the best thing to do, since it was a detail of the truth, and less\ndangerous, therefore, than a falsehood. “At any rate, this is true,” she\nsaid to herself; “that’s always something to the good; he may make\ninquiries; he will see that this is true; it won’t be this, anyhow, that\nwill give me away.” But she was wrong; it was what gave her away; she had\nnot taken into account that this fragmentary detail of the truth had sharp\nedges which could not: be made to fit in, except to those contiguous\nfragments of the truth from which she had arbitrarily detached it, edges\nwhich, whatever the fictitious details in which she might embed it, would\ncontinue to shew, by their overlapping angles and by the gaps which she\nhad forgotten to fill, that its proper place was elsewhere.",
        "“She admits that she heard me ring, and then knock, that she knew it was\nmyself, that she wanted to see me,” Swann thought to himself. “But that\ndoesn’t correspond with the fact that she did not let me in.”",
        "He did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency, for he\nthought that, if left to herself, Odette might perhaps produce some\nfalsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth; she spoke;\nhe did not interrupt her, he gathered up, with an eager and sorrowful\npiety, the words that fell from her lips, feeling (and rightly feeling,\nsince she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke) that, like the\nveil of a sanctuary, they kept a vague imprint, traced a faint outline of\nthat infinitely precious and, alas, undiscoverable truth;–what she had\nbeen doing, that afternoon, at three o’clock, when he had called,–a truth\nof which he would never possess any more than these falsifications,\nillegible and divine traces, a truth which would exist henceforward only\nin the secretive memory of this creature, who would contemplate it in\nutter ignorance of its value, but would never yield it up to him. It was\ntrue that he had, now and then, a strong suspicion that Odette’s daily\nactivities were not hi themselves passionately interesting, and that such\nrelations as she might have with other men did not exhale, naturally, in a\nuniversal sense, or for every rational being, a spirit of morbid gloom\ncapable of infecting with fever or of inciting to suicide. He realised, at\nsuch moments, that that interest, that gloom, existed in him only as a\nmalady might exist, and that, once he was cured of the malady, the actions\nof Odette, the kisses that she might have bestowed, would become once\nagain as innocuous as those of countless other women. But the\nconsciousness that the painful curiosity with which Swann now studied them\nhad its origin only in himself was not enough to make him decide that it\nwas unreasonable to regard that curiosity as important, and to take every\npossible step to satisfy it. Swann had, in fact, reached an age the\nphilosophy of which–supported, in his case, by the current philosophy of\nthe day, as well as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of\nhis life, the group that surrounded the Princesse des Laumes, in which\none’s intelligence was understood to increase with the strength of one’s\ndisbelief in everything, and nothing real and incontestable was to be\ndiscovered, except the individual tastes of each of its members–is no\nlonger that of youth, but a positive, almost a medical philosophy, the\nphilosophy of men who, instead of fixing their aspirations upon external\nobjects, endeavour to separate from the accumulation of the years already\nspent a definite residue of habits and passions which they can regard as\ncharacteristic and permanent, and with which they will deliberately\narrange, before anything else, that the kind of existence which they\nchoose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious.  Swann deemed it wise to\nmake allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived from not\nknowing what Odette had done, just as he made allowance for the impetus\nwhich a damp climate always gave to his eczema; to anticipate in his\nbudget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring, with regard to\nthe daily occupations of Odette, information the lack of which would make\nhim unhappy, just as he reserved a margin for the gratification of other\ntastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be expected (at least,\nbefore he had fallen in love) such as his taste for collecting things, or\nfor good cooking.",
        "When he proposed to take leave of Odette, and to return home, she begged\nhim to stay a little longer, and even detained him forcibly, seizing him\nby the arm as he was opening the door to go. But he gave no thought to\nthat, for, among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little\nincidents which go to make up a conversation, it is inevitable that we\nshould pass (without noticing anything that arouses our interest) by those\nthat hide a truth for which our suspicions are blindly searching, whereas\nwe stop to examine others beneath which nothing lies concealed. She kept\non saying: “What a dreadful pity; you never by any chance come in the\nafternoon, and the one time you do come then I miss you.” He knew very\nwell that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so keenly\ndistressed merely at having missed his visit, but as she was a\ngood-natured woman, anxious to give him pleasure, and often sorry when she\nhad done anything that annoyed him, he found it quite natural that she\nshould be sorry, on this occasion, that she had deprived him of that\npleasure of spending an hour in her company, which was so very great a\npleasure, if not to herself, at any rate to him. All the same, it was a\nmatter of so little importance that her air of unrelieved sorrow began at\nlength to bewilder him. She reminded him, even more than was usual, of the\nfaces of some of the women created by the painter of the Primavera.’ She\nhad, at that moment, their downcast, heartbroken expression, which seems\nready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief too heavy to be borne, when\nthey are merely allowing the Infant Jesus to play with a pomegranate, or\nwatching Moses pour water into a trough. He had seen the same sorrow once\nbefore on her face, but when, he could no longer say. Then, suddenly, he\nremembered it; it was when Odette had lied, in apologising to Mme.\nVerdurin on the evening after the dinner from which she had stayed away on\na pretext of illness, but really so that she might be alone with Swann.\nSurely, even had she been the most scrupulous of women, she could hardly\nhave felt remorse for so innocent a lie. But the lies which Odette\nordinarily told were less innocent, and served to prevent discoveries\nwhich might have involved her in the most terrible difficulties with one\nor another of her friends. And so, when she lied, smitten with fear,\nfeeling herself to be but feebly armed for her defence, unconfident of\nsuccess, she was inclined to weep from sheer exhaustion, as children weep\nsometimes when they have not slept. She knew, also, that her lie, as a\nrule, was doing a serious injury to the man to whom she was telling it,\nand that she might find herself at his mercy if she told it badly.\nTherefore she felt at once humble and culpable in his presence. And when\nshe had to tell an insignificant, social lie its hazardous associations,\nand the memories which it recalled, would leave her weak with a sense of\nexhaustion and penitent with a consciousness of wrongdoing.",
        "What depressing lie was she now concocting for Swann’s benefit, to give\nher that pained expression, that plaintive voice, which seemed to falter\nbeneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make, and to plead for\npardon? He had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what had\noccurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him, but\nsomething more immediate, something, possibly, which had not yet happened,\nbut might happen now at any time, and, when it did, would throw a light\nupon that earlier event. At that moment, he heard the front-door bell\nring. Odette never stopped speaking, but her words dwindled into an\ninarticulate moan. Her regret at not having seen Swann that afternoon, at\nnot having opened the door to him, had melted into a universal despair.",
        "He could hear the gate being closed, and the sound of a carriage, as\nthough some one were going away–probably the person whom Swann must on no\naccount meet–after being told that Odette was not at home.  And then,\nwhen he reflected that, merely by coming at an hour when he was not in the\nhabit of coming, he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of which\nshe did not wish him to know, he had a feeling of discouragement that\namounted, almost, to distress. But since he was in love with Odette, since\nhe was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards her, the pity with\nwhich he might have been inspired for himself he felt for her only, and\nmurmured: “Poor darling!” When finally he left her, she took up several\nletters which were lying on the table, and asked him if he would be so\ngood as to post them for her. He walked along to the post-office, took the\nletters from his pocket, and, before dropping each of them into the box,\nscanned its address. They were all to tradesmen, except the last, which\nwas to Forcheville. He kept it in his hand. “If I saw what was in this,\"\nhe argued, “I should know what she calls him, what she says to him,\nwhether there really is anything between them. Perhaps, if I don’t look\ninside, I shall be lacking in delicacy towards Odette, since in this way\nalone I can rid myself of a suspicion which is, perhaps, a calumny on her,\nwhich must, in any case, cause her suffering, and which can never possibly\nbe set at rest, once the letter is posted.”",
        "He left the post-office and went home, but he had kept the last letter in\nhis pocket. He lighted a candle, and held up close to its flame the\nenvelope which he had not dared to open. At first he could distinguish\nnothing, but the envelope was thin, and by pressing it down on to the\nstiff card which it enclosed he was able, through the transparent paper,\nto read the concluding words. They were a coldly formal signature. If,\ninstead of its being himself who was looking at a letter addressed to\nForcheville, it had been Forcheville who had read a letter addressed to\nSwann, he might have found words in it of another, a far more tender kind!\nHe took a firm hold of the card, which was sliding to and fro, the\nenvelope being too large for it and then, by moving it with his finger and\nthumb, brought one line after another beneath the part of the envelope\nwhere the paper was not doubled, through which alone it was possible to\nread.",
        "In spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly. Not\nthat it mattered, for he had seen enough to assure himself that the letter\nwas about some trifling incident of no importance, and had nothing at all\nto do with love; it was something to do with Odette’s uncle. Swann had\nread quite plainly at the beginning of the line “I was right,” but did not\nunderstand what Odette had been right in doing, until suddenly a word\nwhich he had not been able, at first, to decipher, came to light and made\nthe whole sentence intelligible: “I was right to open the door; it was my\nuncle.” To open the door! Then Forcheville had been there when Swann rang\nthe bell, and she had sent him away; hence the sound that Swann had heard.",
        "After that he read the whole letter; at the end she apologised for having\ntreated Forcheville with so little ceremony, and reminded him that he had\nleft his cigarette-case at her house, precisely what she had written to\nSwann after one of his first visits. But to Swann she had added: “Why did\nyou not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that\nback.” To Forcheville nothing of that sort; no allusion that could suggest\nany intrigue between them. And, really, he was obliged to admit that in\nall this business Forcheville had been worse treated than himself, since\nOdette was writing to him to make him believe that her visitor had been an\nuncle. From which it followed that he, Swann, was the man to whom she\nattached importance, and for whose sake she had sent the other away.  And\nyet, if there had been nothing between Odette and Forcheville, why not\nhave opened the door at once, why have said, “I was right to open the\ndoor; it was my uncle.” Right? if she was doing nothing wrong at that\nmoment how could Forcheville possibly have accounted for her not opening\nthe door? For a time Swann stood still there, heartbroken, bewildered, and\nyet happy; gazing at this envelope which Odette had handed to him without\na scruple, so absolute was her trust in his honour; through its\ntransparent window there had been disclosed to him, with the secret\nhistory of an incident which he had despaired of ever being able to learn,\na fragment of the life of Odette, seen as through a narrow, luminous\nincision, cut into its surface without her knowledge. Then his jealousy\nrejoiced at the discovery, as though that jealousy had had an independent\nexistence, fiercely egotistical, gluttonous of every thing that would feed\nits vitality, even at the expense of Swann himself. Now it had food in\nstore, and Swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening, over the\nvisits that Odette had received about five o’clock, and could seek to\ndiscover where Forcheville had been at that hour. For Swann’s affection\nfor Odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on it, from the\nbeginning, by his ignorance of the occupations in which she passed her\ndays, as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him from\nsupplementing that ignorance by imagination. He was not jealous, at first,\nof the whole of Odette’s life, but of those moments only in which an\nincident, which he had perhaps misinterpreted, had led him to suppose that\nOdette might have played him false. His jealousy, like an octopus which\nthrows out a first, then a second, and finally a third tentacle, fastened\nitself irremovably first to that moment, five o’clock in the afternoon,\nthen to another, then to another again. But Swann was incapable of\ninventing his sufferings. They were only the memory, the perpetuation of a\nsuffering that had come to him from without.",
        "From without, however, everything brought him fresh suffering. He decided\nto separate Odette from Forcheville, by taking her away for a few days to\nthe south. But he imagined that she was coveted by every male person in\nthe hotel, and that she coveted them in return. And so he, who, in old\ndays, when he travelled, used always to seek out new people and crowded\nplaces, might now be seen fleeing savagely from human society as if it had\ncruelly injured him. And how could he not have turned misanthrope, when in\nevery man he saw a potential lover for Odette?  Thus his jealousy did even\nmore than the happy, passionate desire which he had originally felt for\nOdette had done to alter Swann’s character, completely changing, in the\neyes of the world, even the outward signs by which that character had been\nintelligible.",
        "A month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read Odette’s\nletter to Forcheville, Swann went to a dinner which the Verdurins were\ngiving in the Bois. As the party was breaking up he noticed a series of\nwhispered discussions between Mme. Verdurin and several of her guests, and\nthought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to a\nparty at Chatou; now he, Swann, had not been invited to any party.",
        "The Verdurins had spoken only in whispers, and in vague terms, but the\npainter, perhaps without thinking, shouted out: “There must be no lights\nof any sort, and he must play the Moonlight Sonata in the dark, for us to\nsee by.”",
        "Mme. Verdurin, seeing that Swann was within earshot, assumed that\nexpression in which the two-fold desire to make the speaker be quiet and\nto preserve, oneself, an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the\nlistener, is neutralised in an intense vacuity; in which the unflinching\nsigns of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence,\nan expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder, the\nenormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who have\nmade it, at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have been\nmade. Odette seemed suddenly to be in despair, as though she had decided\nnot to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of life, and\nSwann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated him from the\npoint at which, after leaving the restaurant, while he drove her home, he\nwould be able to ask for an explanation, to make her promise, either that\nshe would not go to Chatou next day, or that she would procure an\ninvitation for him also, and to lull to rest in her arms the anguish that\nstill tormented him. At last the carriages were ordered. Mme. Verdurin\nsaid to Swann:",
        "“Good-bye, then. We shall see you soon, I hope,” trying, by the\nfriendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile, to prevent him\nfrom noticing that she Was not saying, as she would always have until\nthen:",
        "“To-morrow, then, at Chatou, and at my house the day after.” M. and Mme.\nVerdurin made Forcheville get into their carriage; Swann’s was drawn up\nbehind it, and he waited for theirs to start before helping Odette into\nhis own.",
        "“Odette, we’ll take you,” said Mme. Verdurin, “we’ve kept a little corner\nspecially for you, beside M. de Forcheville.”",
        "“Yes, Mme. Verdurin,” said Odette meekly.",
        "“What! I thought I was to take you home,” cried Swann, flinging discretion\nto the winds, for the carriage-door hung open, time was precious, and he\ncould not, in his present state, go home without her.",
        "“But Mme. Verdurin has asked me...”",
        "“That’s all right, you can quite well go home alone; we’ve left you like\nthis dozens of times,” said Mme. Verdurin.",
        "“But I had something important to tell Mme. de Crécy.”",
        "“Very well, you can write it to her instead.”",
        "“Good-bye,” said Odette, holding out her hand.",
        "He tried hard to smile, but could only succeed in looking utterly\ndejected.",
        "“What do you think of the airs that Swann is pleased to put on with us?\"\nMme. Verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home.  “I was afraid\nhe was going to eat me, simply because we offered to take Odette back. It\nreally is too bad, that sort of thing. Why doesn’t he say, straight out,\nthat we keep a disorderly house? I can’t conceive how Odette can stand\nsuch manners. He positively seems to be saying, all the time, ’You belong\nto me!’ I shall tell Odette exactly what I think about it all, and I hope\nshe will have the sense to understand me.” A moment later she added,\ninarticulate with rage: “No, but, don’t you see, the filthy creature ...\"\nusing unconsciously, and perhaps in satisfaction of the same obscure need\nto justify herself–like Françoise at Combray when the chicken refused to\ndie–the very words which the last convulsions of an inoffensive animal in\nits death agony wring from the peasant who is engaged in taking its life.\nAnd when Mme. Verdurin’s carriage had moved on, and Swann’s took its\nplace, his coachman, catching sight of his face, asked whether he was\nunwell, or had heard bad news.",
        "Swann sent him away; he preferred to walk, and it was on foot, through the\nBois, that he came home. He talked to himself, aloud, and in the same\nslightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt when describing the\ncharms of the ’little nucleus’ and extolling the magnanimity of the\nVerdurins. But just as the conversation, the smiles, the kisses of Odette\nbecame as odious to him as he had once found them charming, if they were\ndiverted to others than himself, so the Verdurins’ drawing-room, which,\nnot an hour before, had still seemed to him amusing, inspired with a\ngenuine feeling for art and even with a sort of moral aristocracy, now\nthat it was another than himself whom Odette was going to meet there, to\nlove there without restraint, laid bare to him all its absurdities, its\nstupidity, its shame.",
        "He drew a fanciful picture, at which he shuddered in disgust, of the party\nnext evening at Chatou. “Imagine going to Chatou, of all places!  Like a\nlot of drapers after closing time! Upon my word, these people are sublime\nin their smugness; they can’t really exist; they must all have come out of\none of Labiche’s plays!”",
        "The Cottards would be there; possibly Brichot. “Could anything be more\ngrotesque than the lives of these little creatures, hanging on to one\nanother like that. They’d imagine they were utterly lost, upon my soul\nthey would, if they didn’t all meet again to-morrow at Chatou!” Alas!\nthere would be the painter there also, the painter who enjoyed\nmatch-making, who would invite Forcheville to come with Odette to his\nstudio. He could see Odette, in a dress far too smart for the country,\n\"for she is so vulgar in that way, and, poor little thing, she is such a\nfool!”",
        "He could hear the jokes that Mme. Verdurin would make after dinner, jokes\nwhich, whoever the ’bore’ might be at whom they were aimed, had always\namused him because he could watch Odette laughing at them, laughing with\nhim, her laughter almost a part of his. Now he felt that it was possibly\nat him that they would make Odette laugh. “What a fetid form of humour!\"\nhe exclaimed, twisting his mouth into an expression of disgust so violent\nthat he could feel the muscles of his throat stiffen against his collar.\n\"How, in God’s name, can a creature made in His image find anything to\nlaugh at in those nauseating witticisms? The least sensitive nose must be\ndriven away in horror from such stale exhalations. It is really impossible\nto believe that any human being is incapable of understanding that, in\nallowing herself merely to smile at the expense of a fellow-creature who\nhas loyally held out his hand to her, she is casting herself into a mire\nfrom which it will be impossible, with the best will in the world, ever to\nrescue her. I dwell so many miles above the puddles in which these filthy\nlittle vermin sprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities, that I\ncannot possibly be spattered by the witticisms of a Verdurin!” he cried,\ntossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body. “God knows that\nI have honestly attempted to pull Odette out of that sewer, and to teach\nher to breathe a nobler and a purer air. But human patience has its\nlimits, and mine is at an end,” he concluded, as though this sacred\nmission to tear Odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from\nlonger than a few minutes ago, as though he had not undertaken it only\nsince it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might, perchance, be\ndirected at himself, and might have the effect of detaching Odette from\nhim.",
        "He could see the pianist sitting down to play the Moonlight Sonata, and\nthe grimaces of Mme. Verdurin, in terrified anticipation of the wrecking\nof her nerves by Beethoven’s music. “Idiot, liar!” he shouted, “and a\ncreature like that imagines that she’s fond of Art!” She would say to\nOdette, after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for Forcheville, as\nshe had so often done for himself: “You can make room for M. de\nForcheville there, can’t you, Odette?”... ’\"In the dark!’ Codfish!\nPander!” ... ’Pander’ was the name he applied also to the music which\nwould invite them to sit in silence, to dream together, to gaze in each\nother’s eyes, to feel for each other’s hands. He felt that there was much\nto be said, after all, for a sternly censorous attitude towards the arts,\nsuch as Plato adopted, and Bossuet, and the old school of education in\nFrance.",
        "In a word, the life which they led at the Verdurins’, which he had so\noften described as ’genuine,’ seemed to him now the worst possible form of\nlife, and their ’little nucleus’ the most degraded class of society. “It\nreally is,” he repeated, “beneath the lowest rung of the social ladder,\nthe nethermost circle of Dante. Beyond a doubt, the august words of the\nFlorentine refer to the Verdurins! When one comes to think of it, surely\npeople ’in society’ (and, though one may find fault with them now and\nthen, still, after all they are a very different matter from that gang of\nblackmailers) shew a profound sagacity in refusing to know them, or even\nto dirty the tips of their fingers with them. What a sound intuition there\nis in that ’Noli me tangere’ motto of the Faubourg Saint-Germain.”",
        "He had long since emerged from the paths and avenues of the Bois, he had\nalmost reached his own house, and still, for he had not yet thrown off the\nintoxication of grief, or his whim of insincerity, but was ever more and\nmore exhilarated by the false intonation, the artificial sonority of his\nown voice, he continued to perorate aloud in the silence of the night:\n\"People ’in society’ have their failings, as no one knows better than I;\nbut, after all, they are people to whom some things, at least, are\nimpossible.  So-and-so” (a fashionable woman whom he had known) “was far\nfrom being perfect, but, after all, one did find in her a fundamental\ndelicacy, a loyalty in her conduct which made her, whatever happened,\nincapable of a felony, which fixes a vast gulf between her and an old hag\nlike Verdurin. Verdurin! What a name! Oh, there’s something complete about\nthem, something almost fine in their trueness to type; they’re the most\nperfect specimens of their disgusting class! Thank God, it was high time\nthat I stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse with such infamy,\nsuch dung.”",
        "But, just as the virtues which he had still attributed, an hour or so\nearlier, to the Verdurins, would not have sufficed, even although the\nVerdurins had actually possessed them, if they had not also favoured and\nprotected his love, to excite Swann to that state of intoxication in which\nhe waxed tender over their magnanimity, an intoxication which, even when\ndisseminated through the medium of other persons, could have come to him\nfrom Odette alone;–so the immorality (had it really existed) which he now\nfound in the Verdurins would have been powerless, if they had not invited\nOdette with Forcheville and without him, to unstop the vials of his wrath\nand to make him scarify their ’infamy.’ Doubtless Swann’s voice shewed a\nfiner perspicacity than his own when it refused to utter those words full\nof disgust at the Verdurins and their circle, and of joy at his having\nshaken himself free of it, save in an artificial and rhetorical tone, and\nas though his words had been chosen rather to appease his anger than to\nexpress his thoughts. The latter, in fact, while he abandoned himself to\ninvective, were probably, though he did not know it, occupied with a\nwholly different matter, for once he had reached his house, no sooner had\nhe closed the front-door behind him than he suddenly struck his forehead,\nand, making his servant open the door again, dashed out into the street\nshouting, in a voice which, this time, was quite natural; “I believe I\nhave found a way of getting invited to the dinner at Chatou to-morrow!\"\nBut it must have been a bad way, for M. Swann was not invited; Dr.\nCottard, who, having been summoned to attend a serious case in the\ncountry, had not seen the Verdurins for some days, and had been prevented\nfrom appearing at Chatou, said, on the evening after this dinner, as he\nsat down to table at their house:",
        "“Why, aren’t we going to see M. Swann this evening? He is quite what you\nmight call a personal friend...” “I sincerely trust that we sha’n’t!\"\ncried Mme. Verdurin. “Heaven preserve us from him; he’s too deadly for\nwords, a stupid, ill-bred boor.”",
        "On hearing these words Cottard exhibited an intense astonishment blended\nwith entire submission, as though in the face of a scientific truth which\ncontradicted everything that he had previously believed, but was supported\nby an irresistible weight of evidence; with timorous emotion he bowed his\nhead over his plate, and merely replied: “Oh–oh–oh–oh–oh!” traversing,\nin an orderly retirement of his forces, into the depths of his being,\nalong a descending scale, the whole compass of his voice. After which\nthere was no more talk of Swann at the Verdurins’.",
        "And so that drawing-room which had brought Swann and Odette together\nbecame an obstacle in the way of their meeting. She no longer said to him,\nas she had said in the early days of their love: “We shall meet, anyhow,\nto-morrow evening; there’s a supper-party at the Verdurins’,” but “We\nsha’n’t be able to meet to-morrow evening; there’s a supper-party at the\nVerdurins’.” Or else the Verdurins were taking her to the Opéra-Comique,\nto see Une Nuit de Cléopâtre, and Swann could read in her eyes that\nterror lest he should ask her not to go, which, but a little time before,\nhe could not have refrained from greeting with a kiss as it flitted across\nthe face of his mistress, but which now exasperated him. “Yet I’m not\nreally angry,” he assured himself, “when I see how she longs to run away\nand scratch from maggots in that dunghill of cacophony. I’m disappointed;\nnot for myself, but for her; disappointed to find that, after living for\nmore than six months in daily contact with myself, she has not been\ncapable of improving her mind even to the point of spontaneously\neradicating from it a taste for Victor Massé! More than that, to find that\nshe has not arrived at the stage of understanding that there are evenings\non which anyone with the least shade of refinement of feeling should be\nwilling to forego an amusement when she is asked to do so. She ought to\nhave the sense to say: ’I shall not go,’ if it were only from policy,\nsince it is by what she answers now that the quality of her soul will be\ndetermined once and for all.” And having persuaded himself that it was\nsolely, after all, in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate\nof Odette’s spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him\nthat evening instead of going to the Opéra-Comique, he adopted the same\nline of reasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had\nused with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was\nyielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem.",
        "“I swear to you,” he told her, shortly before she was to leave for the\ntheatre, “that, in asking you not to go, I should hope, were I a selfish\nman, for nothing so much as that you should refuse, for I have a thousand\nother things to do this evening, and I shall feel that I have been tricked\nand trapped myself, and shall be thoroughly annoyed, if, after all, you\ntell me that you are not going. But my occupations, my pleasures are not\neverything; I must think of you also. A day may come when, seeing me\nirrevocably sundered from you, you will be entitled to reproach me with\nnot having warned you at the decisive hour in which I felt that I was\ngoing to pass judgment on you, one of those stern judgments which love\ncannot long resist. You see, your Nuit de Cléopâtre (what a title!) has\nno bearing on the point. What I must know is whether you are indeed one of\nthose creatures in the lowest grade of mentality and even of charm, one of\nthose contemptible creatures who are incapable of foregoing a pleasure.\nFor if you are such, how could anyone love you, for you are not even a\nperson, a definite, imperfect, but at least perceptible entity. You are a\nformless water that will trickle down any slope that it may come upon, a\nfish devoid of memory, incapable of thought, which all its life long in\nits aquarium will continue to dash itself, a hundred times a day, against\na wall of glass, always mistaking it for water. Do you realise that your\nanswer will have the effect–I do not say of making me cease from that\nmoment to love you, that goes without saying, but of making you less\nattractive to my eyes when I realise that you are not a person, that you\nare beneath everything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise\nyourself one inch higher? Obviously, I should have preferred to ask you,\nas though it had been a matter of little or no importance, to give up your\nNuit de Cléopâtre (since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject a\nname), in the hope that you would go to it none the less. But, since I had\nresolved to weigh you in the balance, to make so grave an issue depend\nupon your answer, I considered it more honourable to give you due\nwarning.”",
        "Meanwhile, Odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty.\nAlthough the meaning of his tirade was beyond her, she grasped that it was\nto be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication, scenes which\nher familiarity with the ways of men enabled her, without paying any heed\nto the words that were uttered, to conclude that men would not make unless\nthey were in love; that, from the moment when they were in love, it was\nsuperfluous to obey them, since they would only be more in love later on.\nAnd so, she would have heard Swann out with the utmost tranquillity had\nshe not noticed that it was growing late, and that if he went on speaking\nfor any length of time she would “never” as she told him with a fond\nsmile, obstinate but slightly abashed, “get there in time for the\nOverture.”",
        "On other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which, more\nthan anything else, would make him cease to love her, would be her refusal\nto abandon the habit of lying. “Even from the point of view of coquetry,\npure and simple,” he had told her, “can’t you see how much of your\nattraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? By a frank\nadmission–how many faults you might redeem! Really, you are far less\nintelligent than I supposed!” In vain, however, did Swann expound to her\nthus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have succeeded\nin overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but Odette had no such\nsystem; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished Swann to remain\nin ignorance of anything that she had done, with not telling him of it. So\nthat a lie was, to her, something to be used only as a special expedient;\nand the one thing that could make her decide whether she should avail\nherself of a lie or not was a reason which, too, was of a special and\ncontingent order, namely the risk of Swann’s discovering that she had not\ntold him the truth.",
        "Physically, she was passing through an unfortunate phase; she was growing\nstouter, and the expressive, sorrowful charm, the surprised, wistful\nexpressions which she had formerly had, seemed to have vanished with her\nfirst youth, with the result that she became most precious to Swann at the\nvery moment when he found her distinctly less good-looking. He would gaze\nat her for hours on end, trying to recapture the charm which he had once\nseen in her and could not find again. And yet the knowledge that, within\nthis new and strange chrysalis, it was still Odette that lurked, still the\nsame volatile temperament, artful and evasive, was enough to keep Swann\nseeking, with as much passion as ever, to captivate her. Then he would\nlook at photographs of her, taken two years before, and would remember how\nexquisite she had been. And that would console him, a little, for all the\nsufferings that he voluntarily endured on her account.",
        "When the Verdurins took her off to Saint-Germain, or to Chatou, or to\nMeulan, as often as not, if the weather was fine, they would propose to\nremain there for the night, and not go home until next day. Mme.  Verdurin\nwould endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist, whose aunt had\nremained in Paris: “She will be only too glad to be rid of you for a day.\nHow on earth could she be anxious, when she knows you’re with us? Anyhow,\nI’ll take you all under my wing; she can put the blame on me.”",
        "If this attempt failed, M. Verdurin would set off across country until he\ncame to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger, after first\nfinding out which of the ’faithful’ had anyone whom they must warn. But\nOdette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message for anyone,\nfor she had told Swann, once and for all, that she could not possibly send\nmessages to him, before all those people, without compromising herself.\nSometimes she would be absent for several days on end, when the Verdurins\ntook her to see the tombs at Dreux, or to Compiègne, on the painter’s\nadvice, to watch the sun setting through the forest–after which they went\non to the Château of Pierrefonds.",
        "“To think that she could visit really historic buildings with me, who have\nspent ten years in the study of architecture, who am constantly bombarded,\nby people who really count, to take them over Beauvais or\nSaint-Loup-de-Naud, and refuse to take anyone but her; and instead of that\nshe trundles off with the lowest, the most brutally degraded of creatures,\nto go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of Louis-Philippe and\nViollet-le-Duc!  One hardly needs much knowledge of art, I should say, to\ndo that; though, surely, even without any particularly refined sense of\nsmell, one would not deliberately choose to spend a holiday in the\nlatrines, so as to be within range of their fragrant exhalations.”",
        "But when she had set off for Dreux or Pierrefonds–alas, without allowing\nhim to appear there, as though by accident, at her side, for, as she said,\nthat would “create a dreadful impression,\"–he would plunge into the most\nintoxicating romance in the lover’s library, the railway timetable, from\nwhich he learned the ways of joining her there in the afternoon, in the\nevening, even in the morning. The ways? More than that, the authority, the\nright to join her. For, after all, the time-table, and the trains\nthemselves, were not meant for dogs. If the public were carefully\ninformed, by means of printed advertisements, that at eight o’clock in the\nmorning a train started for Pierrefonds which arrived there at ten, that\ncould only be because going to Pierrefonds was a lawful act, for which\npermission from Odette would be superfluous; an act, moreover, which might\nbe performed from a motive altogether different from the desire to see\nOdette, since persons who had never even heard of her performed it daily,\nand in such numbers as justified the labour and expense of stoking the\nengines.",
        "So it came to this; that she could not prevent him from going to\nPierrefonds if he chose to do so. Now that was precisely what he found\nthat he did choose to do, and would at that moment be doing were he, like\nthe travelling public, not acquainted with Odette. For a long time past he\nhad wanted to form a more definite impression of Viollet-le-Duc’s work as\na restorer. And the weather being what it was, he felt an overwhelming\ndesire to spend the day roaming in the forest of Compiègne.",
        "It was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access to\nthe one spot that tempted him to-day. To-day! Why, if he went down there,\nin defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that very day!\nBut then, whereas, if she had met, at Pierrefonds, some one who did not\nmatter, she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure: “What, you here?\"\nand would have invited him to come and see her at the hotel where she was\nstaying with the Verdurins, if, on the other hand, it was himself, Swann,\nthat she encountered there, she would be annoyed, would complain that she\nwas being followed, would love him less in consequence, might even turn\naway in anger when she caught sight of him. “So, then, I am not to be\nallowed to go away for a day anywhere!” she would reproach him on her\nreturn, whereas in fact it was he himself who was not allowed to go.",
        "He had had the sudden idea, so as to contrive to visit Compiègne and\nPierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet\nOdette, of securing an invitation from one of his friends, the Marquis de\nForestelle, who had a country house in that neighbourhood. This friend, to\nwhom Swann suggested the plan without disclosing its ulterior purpose, was\nbeside himself with joy; he did not conceal his astonishment at Swann’s\nconsenting at last, after fifteen years, to come down and visit his\nproperty, and since he did not (he told him) wish to stay there, promised\nto spend some days, at least, in taking him for walks and excursions in\nthe district.  Swann imagined himself down there already with M. de\nForestelle. Even before he saw Odette, even if he did not succeed in\nseeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on that soil where,\nnot knowing the exact spot in which, at any moment, she was to be found,\nhe would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her suddenly\nappearing: in the courtyard of the Château, now beautiful in his eyes\nsince it was on her account that he had gone to visit it; in all the\nstreets of the town, which struck him as romantic; down every ride of the\nforest, roseate with the deep and tender glow of sunset;–innumerable and\nalternative hiding-places, to which would fly simultaneously for refuge,\nin the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his happy, vagabond and divided\nheart. “We mustn’t, on any account,” he would warn M. de Forestelle, “run\nacross Odette and the Verdurins. I have just heard that they are at\nPierrefonds, of all places, to-day. One has plenty of time to see them in\nParis; it would hardly be worth while coming down here if one couldn’t go\na yard without meeting them.” And his host would fail to understand why,\nonce they had reached the place, Swann would change his plans twenty times\nin an hour, inspect the dining-rooms of all the hotels in Compiègne\nwithout being able to make up his mind to settle down in any of them,\nalthough he had found no trace anywhere of the Verdurins, seeming to be in\nsearch of what he had claimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in\nfact avoid, the moment he found it, for if he had come upon the little\n’group,’ he would have hastened away at once with studied indifference,\nsatisfied that he had seen Odette and she him, especially that she had\nseen him when he was not, apparently, thinking about her. But no; she\nwould guess at once that it was for her sake that he had come there. And\nwhen M. de Forestelle came to fetch him, and it was time to start, he\nexcused himself: “No, I’m afraid not; I can’t go to Pierrefonds to-day.\nYou see, Odette is there.” And Swann was happy in spite of everything in\nfeeling that if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to\nPierrefonds that day, it was because he was in fact, for Odette, some one\nwho differed from all other mortals, her lover; and because that\nrestriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel\nfreely where one would, was but one of the many forms of that slavery,\nthat love which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was better not to risk a\nquarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for her return. He spent his days\nin poring over a map of the forest of Compiègne, as though it had been\nthat of the ’Pays du Tendre’; he surrounded himself with photographs of\nthe Château of Pierrefonds. When the day dawned on which it was possible\nthat she might return, he opened the time-table again, calculated what\ntrain she must have taken, and, should she have postponed her departure,\nwhat trains were still left for her to take. He did not leave the house,\nfor fear of missing a telegram, he did not go to bed, in case, having\ncome by the last train, she decided to surprise him with a midnight visit.\nYes! The front-door bell rang. There seemed some delay in opening the\ndoor, he wanted to awaken the porter, he leaned out of the window to shout\nto Odette, if it was Odette, for in spite of the orders which he had gone\ndownstairs a dozen times to deliver in person, they were quite capable of\ntelling her that he was not at home. It was only a servant coming in. He\nnoticed the incessant rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never\nbefore paid any attention.  He could hear them, one after another, a long\nway off, coming nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing\naway into the distance a message which was not for him. He waited all\nnight, to no purpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly, and\nOdette had been in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell\nhim; not knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone\nat a theatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep.",
        "As a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. And such moments\nas these, in which she forgot Swann’s very existence, were of more value\nto Odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities.  For\nin this way Swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had\nonce before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on\nthe night when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins’ and had\nhunted for her all evening. And he did not have (as I had, afterwards, at\nCombray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings that\nwould return with the night. For his days, Swann must pass them without\nOdette; and as he told himself, now and then, to allow so pretty a woman\nto go out by herself in Paris was just as rash as to leave a case filled\nwith jewels in the middle of the street. In this mood he would scowl\nfuriously at the passers-by, as though they were so many pickpockets.  But\ntheir faces–a collective and formless mass–escaped the grasp of his\nimagination, and so failed to feed the flame of his jealousy. The effort\nexhausted Swann’s brain, until, passing his hand over his eyes, he cried\nout: “Heaven help me!” as people, after lashing themselves into an\nintellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the problem of the\nreality of the external world, or that of the immortality of the soul,\nafford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning act of faith. But\nthe thought of his absent mistress was incessantly, indissolubly blended\nwith all the simplest actions of Swann’s daily life–when he took his\nmeals, opened his letters, went for a walk or to bed–by the fact of his\nregret at having to perform those actions without her; like those initials\nof Philibert the Fair which, in the church of Brou, because of her grief,\nher longing for him, Margaret of Austria intertwined everywhere with her\nown. On some days, instead of staying at home, he would go for luncheon to\na restaurant not far off, to which he had been attracted, some time\nbefore, by the excellence of its cookery, but to which he now went only\nfor one of those reasons, at once mystical and absurd, which people call\n’romantic’; because this restaurant (which, by the way, still exists) bore\nthe same name as the street in which Odette lived: the Lapérouse.\nSometimes, when she had been away on a short visit somewhere, several days\nwould elapse before she thought of letting him know that she had returned\nto Paris. And then she would say quite simply, without taking (as she\nwould once have taken) the precaution of covering herself, at all costs,\nwith a little fragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just, at that\nvery moment, arrived by the morning train.  What she said was a falsehood;\nat least for Odette it was a falsehood, inconsistent, lacking (what it\nwould have had, if true) the support of her memory of her actual arrival\nat the station; she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of\nwhat she was saying, while she said it, by the contradictory picture, in\nher mind, of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at\nthe moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train. In\nSwann’s mind, however, these words, meeting no opposition, settled and\nhardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so\nindubitable that, if some friend happened to tell him that he had come by\nthe same train and had not seen Odette, Swann would have been convinced\nthat it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or hour, since\nhis version did not agree with the words uttered by Odette. These words\nhad never appeared to him false except when, before hearing them, he had\nsuspected that they were going to be. For him to believe that she was\nlying, an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable. It was also, however,\nsufficient. Given that, everything that Odette might say appeared to him\nsuspect. Did she mention a name: it was obviously that of one of her\nlovers; once this supposition had taken shape, he would spend weeks in\ntormenting himself; on one occasion he even approached a firm of ’inquiry\nagents’ to find out the address and the occupation of the unknown rival\nwho would give him no peace until he could be proved to have gone abroad,\nand who (he ultimately learned) was an uncle of Odette, and had been dead\nfor twenty years.",
        "Although she would not allow him, as a rule, to meet her at public\ngatherings, saying that people would talk, it happened occasionally that,\nat an evening party to which he and she had each been invited–at\nForcheville’s, at the painter’s, or at a charity ball given in one of the\nMinistries–he found himself in the same room with her. He could see her,\nbut dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be spying upon\nthe pleasures which she tasted in other company, pleasures which–while he\ndrove home in utter loneliness, and went to bed, as anxiously as I myself\nwas to go to bed, some years later, on the evenings when he came to dine\nwith us at Combray–seemed illimitable to him since he had not been able\nto see their end. And, once or twice, he derived from such evenings that\nkind of happiness which one would be inclined (did it not originate in so\nviolent a reaction from an anxiety abruptly terminated) to call peaceful,\nsince it consists in a pacifying of the mind: he had looked in for a\nmoment at a revel in the painter’s studio, and was getting ready to go\nhome; he was leaving behind him Odette, transformed into a brilliant\nstranger, surrounded by men to whom her glances and her gaiety, which were\nnot for him, seemed to hint at some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed\nthere or elsewhere (possibly at the Bal des Incohérents, to which he\ntrembled to think that she might be going on afterwards) which made Swann\nmore jealous than the thought of their actual physical union, since it was\nmore difficult to imagine; he was opening the door to go, when he heard\nhimself called back in these words (which, by cutting off from the party\nthat possible ending which had so appalled him, made the party itself seem\ninnocent in retrospect, made Odette’s return home a thing no longer\ninconceivable and terrible, but tender and familiar, a thing that kept\nclose to his side, like a part of his own daily life, in his carriage; a\nthing that stripped Odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety\nin her appearance, shewed that it was only a disguise which she had\nassumed for a moment, for his sake and not in view of any mysterious\npleasures, a disguise of which she had already wearied)–in these words,\nwhich Odette flung out after him as he was crossing the threshold: “Can’t\nyou wait a minute for me? I’m just going; we’ll drive back together and\nyou can drop me.” It was true that on one occasion Forcheville had asked\nto be driven home at the same time, but when, on reaching Odette’s gate,\nhe had begged to be allowed to come in too, she had replied, with a finger\npointed at Swann: “Ah! That depends on this gentleman. You must ask him.\nVery well, you may come in, just for a minute, if you insist, but you\nmustn’t stay long, for, I warn you, he likes to sit and talk quietly with\nme, and he’s not at all pleased if I have visitors when he’s here. Oh, if\nyou only knew the creature as I know him; isn’t that so, my love, there’s\nno one that really knows you, is there, except me?”",
        "And Swann was, perhaps, even more touched by the spectacle of her\naddressing him thus, in front of Forcheville, not only in these tender\nwords of predilection, but also with certain criticisms, such as: “I feel\nsure you haven’t written yet to your friends, about dining with them on\nSunday.  You needn’t go if you don’t want to, but you might at least be\npolite,” or “Now, have you left your essay on Vermeer here, so that you\ncan do a little more to it to-morrow? What a lazy-bones! I’m going to make\nyou work, I can tell you,” which proved that Odette kept herself in touch\nwith his social engagements and his literary work, that they had indeed a\nlife in common. And as she spoke she bestowed on him a smile which he\ninterpreted as meaning that she was entirely his.",
        "And then, while she was making them some orangeade, suddenly, just as when\nthe reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting all round\nan object, on the wall beyond it, huge and fantastic shadows which, in\ntime, contract and are lost in the shadow of the object itself, all the\nterrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of Odette melted away\nand vanished in the charming creature who stood there before his eyes. He\nhad the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in Odette’s house, in the\nlamp-light, was, perhaps, after all, not an artificial hour, invented for\nhis special use (with the object of concealing that frightening and\ndelicious thing which was incessantly in his thoughts without his ever\nbeing able to form a satisfactory impression of it, an hour of Odette’s\nreal life, of her life when he was not there, looking on) with theatrical\nproperties and pasteboard fruits, but was perhaps a genuine hour of\nOdette’s life; that, if he himself had not been there, she would have\npulled forward the same armchair for Forcheville, would have poured out\nfor him, not any unknown brew, but precisely that orangeade which she was\nnow offering to them both; that the world inhabited by Odette was not that\nother world, fearful and supernatural, in which he spent his time in\nplacing her–and which existed, perhaps, only in his imagination, but the\nreal universe, exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom, comprising that\ntable at which he might sit down, presently, and write, and this drink\nwhich he was being permitted, now, to taste; all the objects which he\ncontemplated with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if,\nin absorbing his dreams, they had delivered him from an obsession, they\nthemselves were, in turn, enriched by the absorption; they shewed him the\npalpable realisation of his fancies, and they interested his mind; they\ntook shape and grew solid before-his eyes, and at the same time they\nsoothed his troubled heart. Ah!  had fate but allowed him to share a\nsingle dwelling with Odette, so that in her house he should be in his own;\nif, when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon, it had been\nOdette’s bill of fare that he had learned from the reply; if, when Odette\nwished to go for a walk, in the morning, along the Avenue du\nBois-de-Boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, though he\nhad no desire to go out, to accompany her, carrying her cloak when she was\ntoo warm; and in the evening, after dinner, if she wished to stay at home,\nand not to dress, if he had been forced to stay beside her, to do what she\nasked; then how completely would all the trivial details of Swann’s life,\nwhich seemed to him now so gloomy, simply because they would, at the same\ntime, have formed part of the life of Odette, have taken on–like that\nlamp, that orangeade, that armchair, which had absorbed so much of his\ndreams, which materialised so much of his longing,–a sort of\nsuperabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity.",
        "And yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much\nlonged was a calm, a peace, which would not have created an atmosphere\nfavourable to his love. When Odette ceased to be for him a creature always\nabsent, regretted, imagined; when the feeling that he had for her was no\nlonger the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by the\nphrase from the sonata, but constant affection and gratitude, when those\nnormal relations were established between them which would put an end to\nhis melancholy madness; then, no doubt, the actions of Odette’s daily life\nwould appear to him as being of but little intrinsic interest–as he had\nseveral times, already, felt that they might be, on the day, for instance,\nwhen he had read, through its envelope, her letter to Forcheville.\nExamining his complaint with as much scientific detachment as if he had\ninoculated himself with it in order to study its effects, he told himself\nthat, when he was cured of it, what Odette might or might not do would be\nindifferent to him. But in his morbid state, to tell the truth, he feared\ndeath itself no more than such a recovery, which would, in fact, amount to\nthe death of all that he then was.",
        "After these quiet evenings, Swann’s suspicions would be temporarily\nlulled; he would bless the name of Odette, and next day, in the morning,\nwould order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her\nkindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the\ndesire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had need\nof some such outlet.",
        "But at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine\nthat Odette was Forcheville’s mistress, and that, when they had both sat\nwatching him from the depths of the Verdurins’ landau, in the Bois, on the\nevening before the party at Chatou to which he had not been invited, while\nhe implored her in vain, with that look of despair on his face which even\nhis coachman had noticed, to come home with him, and then turned away,\nsolitary, crushed,–she must have employed, to draw Forcheville’s\nattention to him, while she murmured: “Do look at him, storming!” the same\nglance, brilliant, malicious, sidelong, cunning, as on the evening when\nForcheville had driven Saniette from the Verdurins’.",
        "At such times Swann detested her. “But I’ve been a fool, too,” he would\nargue. “I’m paying for other men’s pleasures with my money. All the same,\nshe’d better take care, and not pull the string too often, for I might\nvery well stop giving her anything at all. At any rate, we’d better knock\noff supplementary favours for the time being. To think that, only\nyesterday, when she said she would like to go to Bayreuth for the season,\nI was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly little places the\nKing of Bavaria has there, for the two of us. However she didn’t seem\nparticularly keen; she hasn’t said yes or no yet. Let’s hope that she’ll\nrefuse. Good God!  Think of listening to Wagner for a fortnight on end\nwith her, who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in\nlittle apples; it will be fun!” And his hatred, like his love, needing to\nmanifest itself in action, he amused himself with urging his evil\nimaginings further and further, because, thanks to the perfidies with\nwhich he charged Odette, he detested her still more, and would be able, if\nit turned out–as he tried to convince himself–that she was indeed guilty\nof them, to take the opportunity of punishing her, emptying upon her the\noverflowing vials of his wrath. In this way, he went so far as to suppose\nthat he was going to receive a letter from her, in which she would ask him\nfor money to take the house at Bayreuth, but with the warning that he was\nnot to come there himself, as she had promised Forcheville and the\nVerdurins to invite them. Oh, how he would have loved it, had it been\nconceivable that she would have that audacity. What joy he would have in\nrefusing, in drawing up that vindictive reply, the terms of which he\namused himself by selecting and declaiming aloud, as though he had\nactually received her letter.",
        "The very next day, her letter came. She wrote that the Verdurins and their\nfriends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances of\nWagner, and that, if he would be so good as to send her the money, she\nwould be able at last, after going so often to their house, to have the\npleasure of entertaining the Verdurins in hers. Of him she said not a\nword; it was to be taken for granted that their presence at Bayreuth would\nbe a bar to his.",
        "Then that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully\nrehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be used,\nhe had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. Alas! he felt only\ntoo certain that with the money which she had, or could easily procure,\nshe would be able, all the same, to take a house at Bayreuth, since she\nwished to do so, she who was incapable of distinguishing between Bach and\nClapisson.  Let her take it, then; she would have to live in it more\nfrugally, that was all. No means (as there would have been if he had\nreplied by sending her several thousand-franc notes) of organising, each\nevening, in her hired castle, those exquisite little suppers, after which\nshe might perhaps be seized by the whim (which, it was possible, had\nnever yet seized her) of falling into the arms of Forcheville. At any\nrate, this loathsome expedition, it would not be Swann who had to pay for\nit. Ah! if he could only manage to prevent it, if she could sprain her\nankle before starting, if the driver of the carriage which was to take her\nto the station would consent (no matter how great the bribe) to smuggle\nher to some place where she could be kept for a time in seclusion, that\nperfidious woman, her eyes tinselled with a smile of complicity for\nForcheville, which was what Odette had become for Swann in the last\nforty-eight hours.",
        "But she was never that for very long; after a few days the shining, crafty\neyes lost their brightness and their duplicity, that picture of an\nexecrable Odette saying to Forcheville: “Look at him storming!” began to\ngrow pale and to dissolve. Then gradually reappeared and rose before him,\nsoftly radiant, the face of the other Odette, of that Odette who al^o\nturned with a smile to Forcheville, but with a smile in which there was\nnothing but affection for Swann, when she said: “You mustn’t stay long,\nfor this gentleman doesn’t much like my having visitors when he’s here.\nOh! if you only knew the creature as I know him!” that same smile with\nwhich she used to thank Swann for some instance of his courtesy which she\nprized so highly, for some advice for which she had asked him in one of\nthose grave crises in her life, when she could turn to him alone.",
        "Then, to this other Odette, he would ask himself what could have induced\nhim to write that outrageous letter, of which, probably, until then, she\nhad never supposed him capable, a letter which must have lowered him from\nthe high, from the supreme place which, by his generosity, by his loyalty,\nhe had won for himself in her esteem. He would become less dear to her,\nsince it was for those qualities, which she found neither in Forcheville\nnor in any other, that she loved him. It was for them that Odette so often\nshewed him a reciprocal kindness, which counted for less than nothing in\nhis moments of jealousy, because it was not a sign of reciprocal desire,\nwas indeed a proof rather of affection than of love, but the importance of\nwhich he began once more to feel in proportion as the spontaneous\nrelaxation of his suspicions, often accelerated by the distraction brought\nto him by reading about art or by the conversation of a friend, rendered\nhis passion less exacting of reciprocities.",
        "Now that, after this swing of the pendulum, Odette had naturally returned\nto the place from which Swann’s jealousy had for the moment driven her, in\nthe angle in which he found her charming, he pictured her to himself as\nfull of tenderness, with a look of consent in her eyes, and so beautiful\nthat he could not refrain from moving his lips towards her, as though she\nhad actually been in the room for him to kiss; and he preserved a sense of\ngratitude to her for that bewitching, kindly glance, as strong as though\nshe had really looked thus at him, and it had not been merely his\nimagination that had portrayed it in order to satisfy his desire.",
        "What distress he must have caused her! Certainly he found adequate reasons\nfor his resentment, but they would not have been sufficient to make him\nfeel that resentment, if he had not so passionately loved her. Had he not\nnourished grievances, just as serious, against other women, to whom he\nwould, none the less, render willing service to-day, feeling no anger\ntowards them because he no longer loved them? If the day ever came when he\nwould find himself in the same state of indifference with regard to\nOdette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy alone which had\nled him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in this desire (after\nall, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike ingenuousness and\nalso from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be able, in her turn, when\nan occasion offered, to repay the Verdurins for their hospitality, and to\nplay the hostess in a house of her own.",
        "He returned to the other point of view–opposite to that of his love and\nof his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental equity,\nand in order to make allowance for different eventualities–from which he\ntried to form a fresh judgment of Odette, based on the supposition that he\nhad never been in love with her, that she was to him just a woman like\nother women, that her life had not been (whenever he himself was not\npresent) different, a texture woven in secret apart from him, and warped\nagainst him.",
        "Wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with Forcheville or with\nother men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with him, and\nwhich his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements? At\nBayreuth, as in Paris, if it should happen that Forcheville thought of him\nat all, it would only be as of some one who counted for a great deal in\nthe life of Odette, some one for whom he was obliged to make way, when\nthey met in her house. If Forcheville and she scored a triumph by being\ndown there together in spite of him, it was he who had engineered that\ntriumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going there, whereas if he\nhad approved of her plan, which for that matter was quite defensible, she\nwould have had the appearance of being there by his counsel, she would\nhave felt herself sent there, housed there by him, and for the pleasure\nwhich she derived from entertaining those people who had so often\nentertained her, it was to him that she would have had to acknowledge her\nindebtedness.",
        "And if–instead of letting her go off thus, at cross-purposes with him,\nwithout having seen him again–he were to send her this money, if he were\nto encourage her to take this journey, and to go out of his way to make it\ncomfortable and pleasant for her, she would come running to him, happy,\ngrateful, and he would have the joy–the sight of her face–which he had\nnot known for nearly a week, a joy which none other could replace.  For\nthe moment that Swann was able to form a picture of her without revulsion,\nthat he could see once again the friendliness in her smile, and that the\ndesire to tear her away from every rival was no longer imposed by his\njealousy upon his love, that love once again became, more than anything, a\ntaste for the sensations which Odette’s person gave him, for the pleasure\nwhich he found in admiring, as one might a spectacle, or in questioning,\nas one might a phenomenon, the birth of one of her glances, the formation\nof one of her smiles, the utterance of an intonation of her voice. And\nthis pleasure, different from every other, had in the end created in him a\nneed of her, which she alone, by her presence or by her letters, could\nassuage, almost as disinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse as\nanother need which characterised this new period in Swann’s life, when the\nsereness, the depression of the preceding years had been followed by a\nsort of spiritual superabundance, without his knowing to what he owed this\nunlooked-for enrichment of his life, any more than a person in delicate\nhealth who from a certain moment grows stronger, puts on flesh, and seems\nfor a time to be on the road to a complete recovery:–this other need,\nwhich, too, developed in him independently of the visible, material world,\nwas the need to listen to music and to learn to know it.",
        "And so, by the chemical process of his malady, after he had created\njealousy out of his love, he began again to generate tenderness, pity for\nOdette. She had become once more the old Odette, charming and kind. He was\nfull of remorse for having treated her harshly. He wished her to come to\nhim, and, before she came, he wished to have already procured for her some\npleasure, so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her face and\nmoulding her smile.",
        "So, too, Odette, certain of seeing him come to her in a few days, as\ntender and submissive as before, and plead with her for a reconciliation,\nbecame inured, was no longer afraid of displeasing him, or even of making\nhim angry, and refused him, whenever it suited her, the favours by which\nhe set most store.",
        "Perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during their\nquarrel, when he had told her that he would not send her any money, but\nwould do what he could to hurt her. Perhaps she did not realise, either,\nhow sincere he still was, if not with her, at any rate with himself, on\nother occasions when, for the sake of their future relations, to shew\nOdette that he was capable of doing without her, that a rupture was still\npossible between them, he decided to wait some time before going to see\nher again.",
        "Sometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no\nfresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her, he\nknew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more\nprobably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in\nwhich he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy, and would\nnot be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested.\nMeanwhile, a letter from her, crossing his, asked him to postpone one of\nthose very meetings. He asked himself, why; his suspicions, his grief,\nagain took hold of him. He could no longer abide, in the new state of\nagitation into which he found himself plunged, by the arrangements which\nhe had made in his preceding state of comparative calm; he would run to\nfind her, and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following days.\nAnd even if she had not written first, if she merely acknowledged his\nletter, it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing her. For,\nupsetting all Swann’s calculations, Odette’s acceptance had entirely\nchanged his attitude. Like everyone who possesses something precious, so\nas to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to possess it, he\nhad detached the precious object from his mind, leaving, as he thought,\neverything else in the same state as when it was there. But the absence of\none part from a whole is not only that, it is not simply a partial\nomission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a new state which it\nwas impossible to foresee from the old.",
        "But at other times–when Odette was on the point of going away for a\nholiday–it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the\npretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until her\nreturn, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of a serious\nrupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a separation, the\ngreater part of which was inevitable, since she was going away, which, in\nfact, he was merely allowing to start a little sooner than it must. At\nonce he could imagine Odette, puzzled, anxious, distressed at having\nreceived neither visit nor letter from him and this picture of her, by\ncalming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break himself of the habit\nof seeing her.  At odd moments, no doubt, in the furthest recesses of his\nbrain, where his determination had thrust it away, and thanks to the\nlength of the interval, the three weeks’ separation to which he had\nagreed, it was with pleasure that he would consider the idea that he would\nsee Odette again on her return; but it was also with so little impatience\nthat he began to ask himself whether he would not readily consent to the\ndoubling of the period of so easy an abstinence. It had lasted, so far,\nbut three days, a much shorter time than he had often, before, passed\nwithout seeing Odette, and without having, as on this occasion he had,\npremeditated a separation.  And yet, there and then, some tiny trace of\ncontrariety in his mind, or of weakness in his body,–by inciting him to\nregard the present as an exceptional moment, one not to be governed by the\nrules, one in which prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of\nthe soothing effects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time\nshould come when its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday–suspended\nthe action of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or,\nwithout that even, the thought of some information for which he had\nforgotten to ask Odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she\nwould have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment,\nwhether they were ’ordinary’ or ’preference’ shares that she wished him to\nbuy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without\nseeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over again,\nif the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would have\ndone),–and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is let go,\nor the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open, the idea of seeing\nher again, from the remote point in time to which it had been attached,\nsprang back into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities.",
        "It sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance, so\nirresistible, in fact, that Swann had been far less unhappy in watching\nthe end gradually approaching, day by day, of the fortnight which he must\nspend apart from Odette, than he was when kept waiting ten minutes while\nhis coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to her,\nminutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy, in which he\nrecaptured a thousand times over, to lavish on it all the wealth of his\naffection, that idea of his meeting with Odette, which, by so abrupt a\nrepercussion, at a moment when he supposed it so remote, was once more\npresent and on the very surface of his consciousness. The fact was that\nthis idea no longer found, as an obstacle in its course, the desire to\ncontrive without further delay to resist its coming, which had ceased to\nhave any place in Swann’s mind since, having proved to himself–or so, at\nleast, he believed–that he was so easily capable of resisting it, he no\nlonger saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of separation which he\nwas now certain of being able to put into operation whenever he would.\nFurthermore, this idea of seeing her again came back to him adorned with a\nnovelty, a seductiveness, armed with a virulence, all of which long habit\nhad enfeebled, but which had acquired new vigour during this privation,\nnot of three days but of a fortnight (for a period of abstinence may be\ncalculated, by anticipation, as having lasted already until the final date\nassigned to it), and had converted what had been, until then, a pleasure\nin store, which could easily be sacrificed, into an unlooked-for happiness\nwhich he was powerless to resist. Finally, the idea returned to him with\nits beauty enhanced by his own ignorance of what Odette might have\nthought, might, perhaps, have done on finding that he shewed no sign of\nlife, with the result that he was going now to meet with the entrancing\nrevelation of an Odette almost unknown.",
        "But she, just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was\nonly a feint, saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came,\nnow, to ask her, about the repainting of her carriage, or the purchase of\nstock. For she could not reconstruct the several phases of these crises\nthrough which he passed, and in the general idea which she formed of them\nshe made no attempt to understand their mechanism, looking only to what\nshe knew beforehand, their necessary, never-failing and always identical\ntermination. An imperfect idea (though possibly all the more profound in\nconsequence), if one were to judge it from the point of view of Swann, who\nwould doubtless have considered that Odette failed to understand him, just\nas a morphinomaniac or a consumptive, each persuaded that he has been\nthrown back, one by some outside event, at the moment when he was just\ngoing to shake himself free from his inveterate habit, the other by an\naccidental indisposition at the moment when he was just going to be\nfinally cured, feels himself to be misunderstood by the doctor who does\nnot attach the same importance to these pretended contingencies, mere\ndisguises, according to him, assumed, so as to be perceptible by his\npatients, by the vice of one and the morbid state of the other, which in\nreality have never ceased to weigh heavily and incurably upon them while\nthey were nursing their dreams of normality and health.  And, as a matter\nof fact, Swann’s love had reached that stage at which the physician and\n(in the case of certain affections) the boldest of surgeons ask themselves\nwhether to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is\nstill reasonable, or indeed possible.",
        "Certainly, of the extent of this love Swann had no direct knowledge.  When\nhe sought to measure it, it happened sometimes that he found it\ndiminished, shrunken almost to nothing; for instance, the very moderate\nliking, amounting almost to dislike, which, in the days before he was in\nlove with Odette, he had felt for her expressive features, her faded\ncomplexion, returned on certain days. “Really, I am making distinct\nheadway,” he would tell himself on the morrow, “when I come to think it\nover carefully, I find out that I got hardly any pleasure, last night, out\nof being in bed with her; it’s an odd thing, but I actually thought her\nugly.” And certainly he was sincere, but his love extended a long way\nbeyond the province of physical desire. Odette’s person, indeed, no longer\nheld any great place in it. When his eyes fell upon the photograph of\nOdette on his table, or when she came to see him, he had difficulty in\nidentifying her face, either in the flesh or on the pasteboard, with the\npainful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his mind. He would say to\nhimself, almost with astonishment, “It is she!” as when suddenly some one\nshews us in a detached, externalised form one of our own maladies, and we\nfind in it no resemblance to what we are suffering. “She?\"–he tried to\nask himself what that meant; for it is something like love, like death\n(rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies), a thing which one\nrepeatedly calls in question, in order to make oneself probe further into\nit, in the fear that the question will find no answer, that the substance\nwill escape our grasp–the mystery of personality. And this malady, which\nwas Swann’s love, had so far multiplied, was so closely interwoven with\nall his habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his\nsleep, his life, even with what he hoped for after his death, was so\nentirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it away\nwithout almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case was past\noperation.",
        "By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests that\nwhen by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding himself\nthat his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting (although\nshe would not have been able to form any very exact estimate of its\nworth), might, still, add a little to his own value in Odette’s eyes (as\nindeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his love\nitself, which for Odette depreciated everything that it touched by seeming\nto denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would feel\nthere, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and among\npeople that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure as he\nwould have derived from a novel or a painting in which were depicted the\namusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used to enjoy the\nthought of the smooth efficiency of his household, the smartness of his\nown wardrobe and of his servants’ liveries, the soundness of his\ninvestments, with the same relish as when he read in Saint-Simon, who was\none of his favourite authors, of the machinery of daily life at\nVersailles, what Mme. de Maintenon ate and drank, or the shrewd avarice\nand great pomp of Lulli. And in the small extent to which this detachment\nwas not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure which Swann was tasting\nwas that he could emigrate for a moment into those few and distant parts\nof himself which had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain.\nIn this respect the personality, with which my great-aunt endowed him, of\n’young Swann,’ as distinct from the more individual personality of Charles\nSwann, was that in which he now most delighted. Once when, because it was\nthe birthday of the Princesse de Parme (and because she could often be of\nuse, indirectly, to Odette, by letting her have seats for galas and\njubilees and all that sort of thing), he had decided to send her a basket\nof fruit, and was not quite sure where or how to order it, he had\nentrusted the task to a cousin of his mother who, delighted to be doing a\ncommission for him, had written to him, laying stress on the fact that she\nhad not chosen all the fruit at the same place, but the grapes from\nCrapote, whose speciality they were, the straw berries from Jauret, the\npears from Chevet, who always had the best, am soon, “every fruit visited\nand examined, one by one, by myself.” And ii the sequel, by the cordiality\nwith which the Princess thanked him, hi had been able to judge of the\nflavour of the strawberries and of the ripe ness of the pears. But, most\nof all, that “every fruit visited and examinee one by one, by myself” had\nbrought balm to his sufferings by carrying hi mind off to a region which\nhe rarely visited, although it was his by right, as the heir of a rich and\nrespectable middle-class family in which had been handed down from\ngeneration to generation the knowledge of the ’right places’ and the art\nof ordering things from shops.",
        "Of a truth, he had too long forgotten that he was ’young Swann’ not to\nfeel, when he assumed that part again for a moment, a keener pleasure than\nhe was capable of feeling at other times–when, indeed, he was grown sick\nof pleasure; and if the friendliness of the middle-class people, for whom\nhe had never been anything else than ’young Swann,’ was less animated than\nthat of the aristocrats (though more flattering, for all that, since in\nthe middle-class mind friendship is inseparable from respect), no letter\nfrom a Royal Personage, offering him some princely entertainment, could\never be so attractive to Swann as the letter which asked him to be a\nwitness, or merely to be present at a wedding in the family of some old\nfriends of his parents; some of whom had ’kept up’ with him, like my\ngrandfather, who, the year before these events, had invited him to my\nmother’s wedding, while others barely knew him by sight, but were, they\nthought, in duty bound to shew civility to the son, to the worthy\nsuccessor of the late M. Swann.",
        "But, by virtue of his intimacy, already time-honoured, with so many of\nthem, the people of fashion, in a certain sense, were also a part of his\nhouse, his service, and his family. He felt, when his mind dwelt upon his\nbrilliant connections, the same external support, the same solid comfort\nas when he looked at the fine estate, the fine silver, the fine\ntable-linen which had come down to him from his forebears. And the thought\nthat, if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the house, the\npeople whom his valet would instinctively run to find would be the Duc de\nChartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg and the Baron de\nCharlus, brought him the same consolation as our old Françoise derived\nfrom the knowledge that she would, one day, be buried in her own fine\nclothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so exquisitely darned\nthat it merely enhanced one’s idea of the skill and patience of the\nseamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which in her mind’s eye\nshe drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually of wealth and\nprosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. But most of all,–since in every\none of his actions and thoughts which had reference to Odette, Swann was\nconstantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed feeling that he was,\nperhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome to her than anyone, even\nthe most wearisome of the Verdurins’ ’faithful,’–when he betook himself\nto a world in which he was the paramount example of taste, a man whom no\npains were spared to attract, whom people were genuinely sorry not to see,\nhe began once again to believe in the existence of a happier life,\nalmost to feel an appetite for it, as an invalid may feel who has been in\nbed for months and on a strict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and\nreads the account of an official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise\nround Sicily.",
        "If he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not\npaying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her\nthat he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He still paid them (asking\nhimself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps\nexhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her, it\nwould be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each visit\nhe found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some information\nwhich she required, M. de Charlus, whom he had met actually going to her\nhouse, and who had insisted upon Swann’s accompanying him. And, failing\nany excuse, he would beg M. de Charlus to go to her at once, and to tell\nher, as though spontaneously, in the course of conversation, that he had\njust remembered something that he had to say to Swann, and would she\nplease send a message to Swann’s house asking him to come to her then and\nthere; but as a rule Swann waited at home in vain, and M. de Charlus\ninformed him, later in the evening, that his device had not proved\nsuccessful. With the result that, if she was now frequently away from\nParis, even when she was there he scarcely saw her; that she who, when she\nwas in love with him, used to say, “I am always free” and “What can it\nmatter to me, what other people think?” now, whenever he wanted to see\nher, appealed to the proprieties or pleaded some engagement. When he spoke\nof going to a charity entertainment, or a private view, or a first-night\nat which she was to be present, she would expostulate that he wished to\nadvertise their relations in public, that he was treating her like a woman\noff the streets.  Things came to such a pitch that, in an effort to save\nhimself from being altogether forbidden to meet her anywhere, Swann,\nremembering that she knew and was deeply attached to my great-uncle\nAdolphe, whose friend he himself also had been, went one day to see him in\nhis little flat in the Rue de Bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence\nwith Odette. As it happened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to\nSwann about my uncle, a poetical tone, saying: “Ah, he! He is not in the\nleast like you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his\nfriendship for me. He’s not the sort of man who would have so little\nconsideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in\npublic.” This was embarrassing for Swann, who did not know quite to what\nrhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of Odette to my\nuncle. He began by alluding to her excellence, a priori, the axiom of\nher seraphic super-humanity, the revelation of her inexpressible virtues,\nno conception of which could possibly be formed. “I should like to speak\nto you about her,” he went on, “you, who know what a woman supreme above\nall women, what an adorable being, what an angel Odette is. But you know,\nalso, what life is in Paris.  Everyone doesn’t see Odette in the light in\nwhich you and I have been Privileged to see her. And so there are people\nwho think that I am behaving rather foolishly; she won’t even allow me to\nmeet her out of doors, at the theatre. Now you, in whom she has such\nenormous confidence, couldn’t you say a few words for me to her, just to\nassure her that she exaggerate the harm which my bowing to her in the\nstreet might do her?”",
        "My uncle advised Swann not to see Odette for some days, after which she\nwould love him all the more; he advised Odette to let Swann meet he;\neverywhere, and as often as he pleased. A few days later Odette told Swann\nthat she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that my uncle\nwas the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault. She calmed\nSwann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my uncle to a duel,\nbut he refused to shake hands with him when they met again. He regretted\nthis rupture all the more because he had hoped, if he had met my uncle\nAdolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk things over with him in\nstrict confidence, to be able to get him to throw a light on certain\nrumours with regard to the life that Odette had led, in the old days, at\nNice. For my uncle Adolphe used to spend the winter there, and Swann\nthought that it might indeed have been there, perhaps, that he had first\nknown Odette.  The few words which some one had let fall, in his hearing,\nabout a man who, it appeared, had been Odette’s lover, had left Swann dumb\nfoundered.  But the very things which he would, before knowing them, have\nregarded as the most terrible to learn and the most impossible to believe,\nwere, once he knew them, incorporated for all time in the general mass of\nhis sorrow; he admitted them, he could no longer have understood their not\nexisting.  Only, each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line,\naltering the picture that he had formed of his mistress. At one time\nindeed he felt that he could understand that this moral ’lightness,’ of\nwhich he would never have suspected Odette, was perfectly well known, and\nthat at Baden or Nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several\nmonths in one or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous\nnotoriety. He attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch\nagain with certain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew\nOdette, and, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into\ntheir heads, of setting them once more upon her track. But he, to whom, up\ntill then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained\nto the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice, now that he learned that\nOdette had, perhaps, led a ’gay’ life once in those pleasure-cities,\nalthough he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a\nwant of money which, thanks to himself, she no longer felt, or from some\ncapricious instinct which might, at any moment, revive in her, he would\nlean, in impotent anguish, blinded and dizzy, over the bottomless abyss\ninto which had passed, in which had been engulfed those years of his own,\nearly in MacMahon’s Septennat, in which one spent the winter on the\nPromenade des Anglais, the summer beneath the limes of Baden, and would\nfind in those years a sad but splendid profundity, such as a poet might\nhave lent to them; and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all\nthe insignificant details that made up the daily round on the Côte d’Azur\nin those days, if it could have helped him to understand something that\nstill baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of Odette, more enthusiasm\nthan does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of\nfifteenth-century Florence, so as to try to penetrate further into the\nsoul of the Primavera, the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli. He would\nsit, often, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming;\nand she would comment: “You do look sad!” It was not very long since, from\nthe idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best women\nthat he had known, he had passed to that of her being ’kept’; and yet\nalready, by an inverse process, he had returned from the Odette de Crécy,\nperhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the ’ladies’ men’ of Nice\nand Baden, to this face, the expression on which was so often gentle, to\nthis nature so eminently human. He would ask himself: “What does it mean,\nafter all, to say that everyone at Nice knows who Odette de Crécy is?\nReputations of that sort, even when they’re true, are always based upon\nother people’s ideas\"; he would reflect that this legend–even if it were\nauthentic–was something external to Odette, was not inherent in her like\na mischievous and ineradicable personality; that the creature who might\nhave been led astray was a woman with frank eyes, a heart full of pity for\nthe sufferings of others, a docile body which he had pressed tightly in\nhis arms and explored with his fingers, a woman of whom he might one day\ncome into absolute possession if he succeeded in making himself\nindispensable to her. There she was, often tired, her face left blank for\nthe nonce by that eager, feverish preoccupation with the unknown things\nwhich made Swann suffer; she would push back her hair with both hands; her\nforehead, her whole face would seem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some\nordinary human thought, some worthy sentiment such as is to be found in\nall creatures when, in a moment of rest or meditation, they are free to\nexpress themselves, would flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. And\nimmediately the whole of her face would light up like a grey landscape,\nswathed in clouds which, suddenly, are swept away and the dull scene\ntransfigured, at the moment of the sun’s setting.  The life which occupied\nOdette at such times, even the future which she seemed to be dreamily\nregarding, Swann could have shared with her. No evil disturbance seemed to\nhave left any effect on them. Rare as they became, those moments did not\noccur in vain. By the process of memory, Swann joined the fragments\ntogether, abolished the intervals between them, cast, as in molten gold,\nthe image of an Odette compact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he\nwas to make, later on (as we shall see in the second part of this story)\nsacrifices which the other Odette would never have won from him. But how\nrare those moments were, and how seldom he now saw her! Even in regard to\ntheir evening meetings, she would never tell him until the last minute\nwhether she would be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always\nfree, she wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come\nto her. She would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which\nwas of the very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made Swann\ncome to her house, any of her friends asked her, half-way through the\nevening, to join them at some theatre, or at supper afterwards, she would\njump for joy and dress herself with all speed.  As her toilet progressed,\nevery movement that she made brought Swann nearer to the moment when he\nwould have to part from her, when she would fly off with irresistible\nforce; and when at length she was ready, and, Plunging into her mirror a\nlast glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look well, smeared a\nlittle salve on her lips, fixed a stray loci of hair over her brow, and\ncalled for her cloak of sky-blue silk with golden tassels, Swann would be\nlooking so wretched that she would be unable to restrain a gesture of\nimpatience as she flung at him: “So that is how you thank me for keeping\nyou here till the last minute! And I thought I was being so nice to you.\nWell, I shall know better another time!” Sometime ... at the risk of\nannoying her, he made up his mind that he would find out where she had\ngone, and even dreamed of a defensive alliance with Forcheville, who might\nperhaps have been able to tell him. But anyhow, when he knew with whom she\nwas spending the evening, it was very seldom that he could not discover,\namong all his innumerable acquaintance, some one who knew–if only\nindirectly–the man with whom she had gone out, and could easily obtain\nthis or that piece of information about him. And while he was writing to\none of his friends, asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon\nsome point or other, he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex\nhimself with questions to which there was no answer and transferring to\nsome one else the strain of interrogation. It is true that Swann was\nlittle the wiser for such information as he did receive. To know a thing\ndoes not enable us, always, to prevent its happening, but after all the\nthings that we know we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our\nminds, where we can dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the\nillusion of a sort of power to control them. He was quite happy whenever\nM. de Charlus was with Odette. He knew that between M. de Charlus and her\nnothing untoward could ever happen, that when M. de Charlus went anywhere\nwith her, it was out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no\ndifficulty about telling him everything that she had done.  Sometimes she\nhad declared so emphatically to Swann that it was impossible for him to\nsee her on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so\nkeenly to some outing, that Swann attached a very real importance to the\nfact that M. de Charlus was free to accompany her. Next day, without\ndaring to put many questions to M. de Charlus, he would force him, by\nappearing not quite to understand his first answers, to give him more,\nafter each of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he\nvery soon learned that Odette had spent her evening in the most innocent\nof dissipations.",
        "“But what do you mean, my dear Mémé, I don’t quite understand....  You\ndidn’t go straight from her house to the Musée Grévin? Surely you went\nsomewhere else first? No? That is very odd! You don’t know how amusing you\nare, my dear Mémé. But what an odd idea of hers to go on to the Chat Noir\nafterwards; it was her idea, I suppose? No? Yours?  That’s strange. After\nall, it wasn’t a bad idea; she must have known dozens of people there? No?\nShe never spoke to a soul? How extraordinary! Then you sat there like\nthat, just you and she, all by yourselves? I can picture you, sitting\nthere! You are a worthy fellow, my dear Mémé; I’m exceedingly fond of\nyou.”",
        "Swann was now quite at ease. To him, who had so often happened, when\ntalking to friends who knew nothing of his love, friends to whom he hardly\nlistened, to hear certain detached sentences (as, for instance, “I saw\nMme.  de Crécy yesterday; she was with a man I didn’t know.”), sentences\nwhich dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid state, grew\nhard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay there\nirremovable,–how charming, by way of contrast, were the words: “She didn’t\nknow a soul; she never spoke to a soul.” How freely they coursed through\nhim, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to breathe! And yet, a\nmoment later, he was telling himself that Odette must find him very dull\nif those were the pleasures that she preferred to his company. And their\nvery insignificance, though it reassured him, pained him as if her\nenjoyment of them had been an act of treachery.",
        "Even when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have sufficed\nto alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which Odette’s presence,\nthe charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific which in the\nlong run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the disease, but\nat least brought temporary relief to his sufferings), it would have\nsufficed, had Odette only permitted him to remain in her house while she\nwas out, to wait there until that hour of her return, into whose stillness\nand peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there, all memory of those\nintervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed spell had made him\nimagine as, somehow, different from the rest. But she would not; he must\nreturn home; he forced himself, on the way, to form various plans, ceased\nto think of Odette; he even reached the stage, while he undressed, of\nturning over all sorts of happy ideas in his mind: it was with a light\nheart, buoyed with the anticipation of going to see some favourite work of\nart on the morrow, that he jumped into bed and turned out the light; but\nno sooner had he made himself ready to sleep, relaxing a self-control of\nwhich he was not even conscious, so habitual had it become, than an icy\nshudder convulsed his body and he burst into sobs. He did not wish to know\nwhy, but dried his eyes, saying with a smile: “This is delightful; I’m\nbecoming neurasthenic.” After which he could not save himself from utter\nexhaustion at the thought that, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt\nto find out what Odette had been doing, must use all his influence to\ncontrive to see her. This compulsion to an activity without respite,\nwithout variety, without result, was so cruel a scourge that one day,\nnoticing a swelling over his stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea\nthat he had, perhaps, a tumour which would prove fatal, that he need not\nconcern himself with anything further, that it was his malady which was\ngoing to govern his life, to make a plaything of him, until the\nnot-distant end. If indeed, at this period, it often happened that, though\nwithout admitting it even to himself, he longed for death, it was in order\nto escape not so much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the\nmonotony of his struggle.",
        "And yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no longer\nloved her, when she would have no reason for lying to him, when at length\nhe might learn from her whether, on the day when he had gone to see her in\nthe afternoon, she had or had not been in the arms of Forcheville.  Often\nfor several days on end the suspicion that she was in love with some one\nelse would distract his mind from the question of Forcheville, making it\nalmost immaterial to him, like those new developments of a continuous\nstate of ill-health which seem for a little time to have delivered us from\ntheir predecessors. There were even days when he was not tormented by any\nsuspicion. He fancied that he was cured. But next morning, when he awoke,\nhe felt in the same place the same pain, a sensation which, the day\nbefore, he had, as it were, diluted in the torrent of different\nimpressions.  But it had not stirred from its place. Indeed, it was the\nsharpness of this pain that had awakened him.",
        "Since Odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important\nmatters which took up so much of her time every day (albeit he had lived\nlong enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything else\nthan pleasures) he could not sustain for any length of time the effort to\nimagine them; his brain would become a void; then he would pass a finger\nover his tired eyelids, in the same way as he might have wiped his\neyeglass, and would cease altogether to think. There emerged, however,\nfrom this unexplored tract, certain occupations which reappeared from time\nto time, vaguely connected by Odette with some obligation towards distant\nrelatives or old friends who, inasmuch as they were the only people whom\nshe was in the habit of mentioning as preventing her from seeing him,\nseemed to Swann to compose the necessary, unalterable setting of her life.\nBecause of the tone in which she referred, from time to time, to “the day\nwhen I go with my friend to the Hippodrome,” if, when he felt unwell and\nhad thought, “Perhaps Odette would be kind and come to see me,” he\nremembered, suddenly, that it was one of those very days, he would correct\nhimself with an “Oh, no! It’s not worth while asking her to come; I should\nhave thought of it before, this is the day when she goes with her friend\nto the Hippodrome. We must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use\nwasting our time in proposing things that can’t be accepted and are\ndeclined in advance.” And this duty that was incumbent upon Odette, of\ngoing to the Hippodrome, to which Swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be\nnot merely ineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped\nit seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even\nremotely connected with it. If, when Odette, in the street, had\nacknowledged the salute of a passer-by, which had aroused Swann’s\njealousy, she replied to his questions by associating the stranger with\nany of the two or three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to\nhim; if, for instance, she said: “That’s a gentleman who was in my\nfriend’s box the other day; the one I go to the Hippodrome with,” that\nexplanation would set Swann’s suspicions at rest; it was, after all,\ninevitable that this friend should have other guests than Odette in her\nbox at the Hippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in\nforming any coherent impression of them. Oh! how he would have loved to\nknow her, that friend who went to the Hippodrome, how he would have loved\nher to invite him there with Odette. How readily he would have sacrificed\nall his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of\nseeing Odette, were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop. He would\nhave taken more trouble, incurred more expense for them than for queens.\nWould they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in their\nknowledge of the life of Odette, with the one potent anodyne for his pain?\nWith what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with one or other\nof those humble folk with whom Odette kept up friendly relations, either\nwith some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity of nature. How\nwillingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the attics of some\nsordid but enviable house, where Odette went but never took him, and\nwhere, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker, whose lover he\nwould readily have pretended to be, he would have been visited by. Odette\nalmost daily.  In those regions, that were almost slums, what a modest\nexistence, abject, if you please, but delightful, nourished by\ntranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead indefinitely.",
        "It sometimes happened, again, that, when, after meeting Swann, she saw\nsome man approaching whom he did not know, he could distinguish upon\nOdette’s face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he\nhad come to her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for, on\nthe days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread of\nwhat people would think, she did actually manage to see Swann, the\npredominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking\ncontrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction\nfrom the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship,\nshe had felt in his presence, and even in his absence, when she began a\nletter to him with the words: “My dear, my hand trembles so that I can\nscarcely write.” (So, at least, she pretended, and a little of that\nemotion must have been sincere, or she would not have been anxious to\nenlarge and emphasise it.) So Swann had been pleasing to her then. Our\nhands do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those whom we love. When\nthey have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful, how easy, how bold\ndo we become in their presence! In speaking to him, in writing to him now,\nshe no longer employed those words by which she had sought to give herself\nthe illusion that he belonged to her, creating opportunities for saying\n\"my” and “mine” when she referred to him: “You are all that I have in the\nworld; it is the perfume of our friendship, I shall keep it,” nor spoke to\nhim of the future, of death itself, as of a single adventure which they\nwould have to share.  In those early days, whatever he might say to her,\nshe would answer admiringly: “You know, you will never be like other\npeople!\"–she would gaze at his long, slightly bald head, of which people\nwho know only of his successes used to think: “He’s not regularly\ngood-looking, if you like, but he is smart; that tuft, that eyeglass, that\nsmile!” and, with more curiosity perhaps to know him as he really was than\ndesire to become his mistress, she would sigh:",
        "“I do wish I could find out what there is in that head of yours!”",
        "But, now, whatever he might say, she would answer, in a tone sometimes of\nirritation, sometimes indulgent: “Ah! so you never will be like other\npeople!”",
        "She would gaze at his head, which was hardly aged at all by his recent\nanxieties (though people now thought of it, by the same mental process\nwhich enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music of\nwhich one has read the programme, or the ’likenesses’ in a child whose\nfamily one has known: “He’s not positively ugly, if you like, but he is\nreally rather absurd; that eyeglass, that tuft, that smile!” realising in\ntheir imagination, fed by suggestion, the invisible boundary which\ndivides, at a few months’ interval, the head of an ardent lover from a\ncuckold’s), and would say:",
        "“Oh, I do wish I could change you; put some sense into that head of\nyours.”",
        "Always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped, if it was only\nOdette’s way of behaving to him that left room for doubt, he would fling\nhimself greedily upon her words: “You can if you like,” he would tell her.",
        "And he tried to explain to her that to comfort him, to control him, to\nmake him work would be a noble task, to which numbers of other women asked\nfor nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves, though it is\nonly fair to add that in those other women’s hands the noble task would\nhave seemed to Swann nothing more than an indiscreet and intolerable\nusurpation of his freedom of action. “If she didn’t love me, just a\nlittle,” he told himself, “she would not wish to have me altered. To alter\nme, she will have to see me more often.” And so he was able to trace, in\nthese faults which she found in him, a proof at least of her interest,\nperhaps even of her love; and, in fact, she gave him so little, now, of\nthe last, that he was obliged to regard as proofs of her interest in him\nthe various things which, every now and then, she forbade him to do. One\nday she announced that she did not care for his coachman, who, she\nthought, was perhaps setting Swann against her, and, anyhow, did not shew\nthat promptness and deference to Swann’s orders which she would have liked\nto see. She felt that he wanted to hear her say: “Don’t have him again\nwhen you come to me,” just as he might have wanted her to kiss him. So,\nbeing in a good temper, she said it; and he was deeply moved. That\nevening, when talking to M. de Charlus, with whom he had the satisfaction\nof being able to speak of her openly (for the most trivial remarks that he\nuttered now, even to people who had never heard of her, had always some\nsort of reference to Odette), he said to him:",
        "“I believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now, and\nshe certainly takes an interest in what I do.”",
        "And if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his carriage\nwith a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way, his friend said:\n\"Hullo! that isn’t Loredan on the box?” with what melancholy joy would\nSwann answer him:",
        "“Oh! Good heavens, no! I can tell you, I daren’t take Loredan when I go to\nthe Rue La Pérouse; Odette doesn’t like me to have Loredan, she thinks he\ndoesn’t suit me. What on earth is one to do? Women, you know, women. My\ndear fellow, she would be furious. Oh, lord, yes; I’ve only to take Rémi\nthere; I should never hear the last of it!”",
        "These new manners, indifferent, listless, irritable, which Odette now\nadopted with Swann, undoubtedly made him suffer; but he did not realise\nhow much he suffered; since it had been with a regular progression, day\nafter day, that Odette had chilled towards him, it was only by directly\ncontrasting what she was to-day with what she had been at first that he\ncould have measured the extent of the change that had taken place. Now\nthis change was his deep, his secret wound, which pained him day and\nnight, and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it,\nhe would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made to\nsuffer too keenly. He might say to himself in a vague way: “There was a\ntime when Odette loved me more,” but he never formed any definite picture\nof that time. Just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he contrived\nnever to look, which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever he entered\nor left the room, because in one of its drawers he had locked away the\nchrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first evenings when\nhe had taken her home in his carriage, and the letters in which she said:\n\"Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have\nthat back,” and “At whatever hour of the day or night you may need me,\njust send me a word, and dispose of me as you please,” so there was a\nplace in his heart to which he would never allow his thoughts to trespass\ntoo near, forcing them, if need be, to evade it by a long course of\nreasoning so that they should not have to pass within reach of it; the\nplace in which lingered his memories of happy days.",
        "But his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone\nout to a party.",
        "It was at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte’s, on the last, for that season,\nof the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians who\nwould serve, later on, for her charity concerts. Swann, who had intended\nto go to each of the previous evenings in turn, but had never been able to\nmake up his mind, received, while he was dressing for this party, a visit\nfrom the Baron de Charlus, who came with an offer to go with him to the\nMarquise’s, if his company could be of any use in helping Swann not to\nfeel quite so bored when he got there, to be a little less unhappy. But\nSwann had thanked him with:",
        "“You can’t conceive how glad I should be of your company. But the greatest\npleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead to see\nOdette. You know what a splendid influence you have over her. I don’t\nsuppose she’ll be going anywhere this evening, unless she goes to see her\nold dressmaker, and I’m sure she would be delighted if you went with her\nthere. In any case, you’ll find her at home before then. Try to keep her\namused, and also to give her a little sound advice. If you could arrange\nsomething for to-morrow which would please her, something that we could\nall three do together. Try to put out a feeler, too, for the summer; see\nif there’s anything she wants to do, a cruise that we might all three\ntake; anything you can think of. I don’t count upon seeing her to-night,\nmyself; still if she would like me to come, or if you find a loophole,\nyou’ve only to send me a line at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s up till midnight;\nafter that I shall be here. Ever so many thanks for all you are doing for\nme–you know what I feel about you!”",
        "His friend promised to go and do as Swann wished as soon as he had\ndeposited him at the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where he arrived\nsoothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening in\nthe Rue La Pérouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to\neverything that did not involve Odette, and in particular to the details\nof fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is to\nbe found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire,\nappears to us in its own guise. On alighting from his carriage, in the\nforeground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which\nhostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions,\nand in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and setting,\nSwann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of Balzac’s\n’tigers’–now ’grooms’–.  who normally followed their mistress when she\nwalked abroad, but now, hatted and booted, were posted out of doors, in\nfront of the house on the gravelled drive, or outside the stables, as\ngardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of their several\nflower-beds. The peculiar tendency which he had always had to look for\nanalogies between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted\nitself here, but in a more positive and more general form; it was society\nas a whole, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to\nhim in a series of pictures. In the cloak-room, into which, in the old\ndays, when he was still a man of fashion, he would have gone in his\novercoat, to emerge from it in evening dress, but without any impression\nof what had occurred there, his mind having been, during the minute or two\nthat he had spent in it, either still at the party which he had just left,\nor already at the party into which he was just about to be ushered, he now\nnoticed, for the first time, roused by the unexpected arrival of so\nbelated a guest, the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals, the\nenormous footmen who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests,\nuntil, pointing their noble greyhound profiles, they towered upon their\nfeet and gathered in a circle round about him.",
        "One of them, of a particularly ferocious aspect, and not unlike the\nheadsman in certain Renaissance pictures which represent executions,\ntortures, and the like, advanced upon him with an implacable air to take\nhis ’things.’ But the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by the\nsoftness of his cotton gloves, so effectively that, as he approached\nSwann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person\nand the most tender regard for his hat. He took it with a care to which\nthe precision of his movements imparted something that was almost\nover-fastidious, and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching by\nthe evidence of his splendid strength. Then he passed it to one of his\nsatellites, a novice and timid, who was expressing the panic that\noverpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction, and\ndisplayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of\nits captivity.",
        "A few feet away, a strapping great lad in livery stood musing, motionless,\nstatuesque, useless, like that purely decorative warrior whom one sees in\nthe most tumultuous of Mantegna’s paintings, lost in dreams, leaning upon\nhis shield, while all around him are fighting and bloodshed and death;\ndetached from the group of his companions who were thronging about Swann,\nhe seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in the scene, which he\nfollowed vaguely with his cruel, greenish eyes, as if it had been the\nMassacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint James. He seemed\nprecisely to have sprung from that vanished race–if, indeed, it ever\nexisted, save in the reredos of San Zeno and the frescoes of the\nEremitani, where Swann had come in contact with it, and where it still\ndreams–fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue by some one of the\nMaster’s Paduan models, or of Albert Duerer’s Saxons. And the locks of his\nreddish hair, crinkled by nature, but glued to his head by brilliantine,\nwere treated broadly as they are in that Greek sculpture which the\nMantuan painter never ceased to study, and which, if in its creator’s\npurpose it represents but man, manages at least to extract from man’s\nsimple outlines such a variety of richness, borrowed, as it were, from the\nwhole of animated nature, that a head of hair, by the glossy undulation\nand beak-like points of its curls, or in the overlaying of the florid\ntriple diadem of its brushed tresses, can suggest at once a bunch of\nseaweed, a brood of fledgling doves, a bed of hyacinths and a serpent’s\nwrithing back. Others again, no less colossal, were disposed upon the\nsteps of a monumental staircase which, by their decorative presence and\nmarmorean immobility, was made worthy to be named, like that god-crowned\nascent in the Palace of the Doges, the ’Staircase of the Giants,’ and on\nwhich Swann now set foot, saddened by the thought that Odette had never\nclimbed it. Ah, with what joy would he, on the other hand, have raced up\nthe dark, evil-smelling, breakneck flights to the little dressmaker’s, in\nwhose attic he would so gladly have paid the price of a weekly stage-box\nat the Opera for the right to spend the evening there when Odette came,\nand other days too, for the privilege of talking about her, of living\namong people whom she was in the habit of seeing when he was not there,\nand who, on that account, seemed to keep secret among themselves some part\nof the life of his mistress more real, more inaccessible and more\nmysterious than anything that he knew. Whereas upon that pestilential,\nenviable staircase to the old dressmaker’s, since there was no other, no\nservice stair in the building, one saw in the evening outside every door\nan empty, unwashed milk-can set out, in readiness for the morning round,\nupon the door-mat; on the despicable, enormous staircase which Swann was\nat that moment climbing, on either side of him, at different levels,\nbefore each anfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porter’s\nlodge or the entrance to a set of rooms, representing the departments of\nindoor service which they controlled, and doing homage for them to the\nguests, a gate-keeper, a major-domo, a steward (worthy men who spent the\nrest of the week in semi-independence in their own domains, dined there by\nthemselves like small shopkeepers, and might to-morrow lapse to the\nplebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate),\nscrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had\nbeen heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant livery\nwhich they wore only at long intervals, and in which they did not feel\naltogether at their ease, stood each in the arcade of his doorway, their\nsplendid pomp tempered by a democratic good-fellowship, like saints in\ntheir niches, and a gigantic usher, dressed Swiss Guard fashion, like the\nbeadle in a church, struck the pavement with his staff as each fresh\narrival passed him. Coming to the top of the staircase, up which he had\nbeen followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and a small pigtail\nclubbed at the back of his head, like one of Goya’s sacristans or a\ntabellion in an old play, Swann passed by an office in which the lackeys,\nseated like notaries before their massive registers, rose solemnly to\ntheir feet and inscribed his name. He next crossed a little hall\nwhich–just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners to serve as the\nsetting for a single work of art (from which they take their name), and,\nin their studied bareness, contain nothing else besides–displayed to him\nas he entered it, like some priceless effigy by Benvenuto Cellini of an\narmed watchman, a young footman, his body slightly bent forward, rearing\nabove his crimson gorget an even more crimson face, from which seemed to\nburst forth torrents of fire, timidity and zeal, who, as he pierced the\nAubusson tapestries that screened the door of the room in which the music\nwas being given with his impetuous, vigilant, desperate gaze, appeared,\nwith a soldierly impassibility or a supernatural faith–an allegory of\nalarums, incarnation of alertness, commemoration of a riot–to be looking\nout, angel or sentinel, from the tower of dungeon or cathedral, for the\napproach of the enemy or for the hour of Judgment.  Swann had now only to\nenter the concert-room, the doors of which were thrown open to him by an\nusher loaded with chains, who bowed low before him as though tendering to\nhim the keys of a conquered city.  But he thought of the house in which at\nthat very moment he might have been, if Odette had but permitted, and the\nremembered glimpse of an empty milk-can upon a door-mat wrung his heart.",
        "He speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male\nwhen, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of the\nservants gave place to that of the guests. But even this ugliness of\nfaces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new\nand uncanny, now that their features,–instead of being to him symbols of\npractical utility in the identification of this or that man, who until\nthen had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after, boredoms\nto be avoided, or courtesies to be acknowledged–were at rest, measurable\nby aesthetic co-ordinates alone, in the autonomy of their curves and\nangles.  And in these men, in the thick of whom Swann now found himself\npacked, there was nothing (even to the monocle which many of them wore,\nand which, previously, would, at the most, have enabled Swann to say that\nso-and-so wore a monocle) which, no longer restricted to the general\nconnotation of a habit, the same in all of them, did not now strike him\nwith a sense of individuality in each. Perhaps because he did not regard\nGeneral de Froberville and the Marquis de Bréaute, who were talking\ntogether just inside the door, as anything more than two figures in a\npicture, whereas they were the old and useful friends who had put him up\nfor the Jockey Club and had supported him in duels, the General’s monocle,\nstuck like a shell-splinter in his common, scarred, victorious,\noverbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it left half-blinded,\nlike the single-eyed flashing front of the Cyclops, appeared to Swann as a\nmonstrous wound which it might have been glorious to receive but which it\nwas certainly not decent to expose, while that which M. de Bréaute wore,\nas a festive badge, with his pearl-grey gloves, his crush hat and white\ntie, substituting it for the familiar pair of glasses (as Swann himself\ndid) when he went out to places, bore, glued to its other side, like a\nspecimen prepared on a slide for the microscope, an infinitesimal gaze\nthat swarmed with friendly feeling and never ceased to twinkle at the\nloftiness of ceilings, the delightfulness of parties, the interestingness\nof programmes and the excellence of refreshments.",
        "“Hallo! you here! why, it’s ages since I’ve seen you,” the General greeted\nSwann and, noticing the look of strain on his face and concluding that it\nwas perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away, went on, “You’re\nlooking well, old man!” while M. de Bréauté turned with, “My dear fellow,\nwhat on earth are you doing here?” to a ’society novelist’ who had just\nfitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his own monocle, the sole\ninstrument that he used in his psychological investigations and\nremorseless analyses of character, and who now replied, with an air of\nmystery and importance, rolling the ’r’:–\"I am observing!”",
        "The Marquis de Forestelle’s monocle was minute and rimless, and, by\nenforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it\nwas incrusted like a superfluous cartilage, the presence of which there\nwas inexplicable and its substance unimaginable, it gave to his face a\nmelancholy refinement, and led women to suppose him capable of suffering\nterribly when in love. But that of M. de Saint-Candé, girdled, like\nSaturn, with an enormous ring, was the centre of gravity of a face which\ncomposed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass, while his\nthrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their\ngrimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled in\nthe polished disk, and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing eyes in\nthe world by the smart, depraved young women whom it set dreaming of\nartificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss; and then, behind him,\nM. de Palancy, who with his huge carp’s head and goggling eyes moved\nslowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings, unlocking his great\nmandibles at every moment as though in search of his orientation, had the\nair of carrying about upon his person only an accidental and perhaps\npurely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of his aquarium, a part\nintended to suggest the whole which recalled to Swann, a fervent admirer\nof Giotto’s Vices and Virtues at Padua, that Injustice by whose side a\nleafy bough evokes the idea of the forests that enshroud his secret lair.",
        "Swann had gone forward into the room, under pressure from Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte and in order to listen to an aria from Orfeo which was\nbeing rendered on the flute, and had taken up a position in a corner from\nwhich, unfortunately, his horizon was bounded by two ladies of ’uncertain’\nage, seated side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de\nFranquetot, who, because they were cousins, used to spend their time at\nparties in wandering through the rooms, each clutching her bag and\nfollowed by her daughter, hunting for one another like people at a railway\nstation, and could never be at rest until they had reserved, by marking\nthem with their fans or handkerchiefs, two adjacent chairs; Mme. de\nCambremer, since she knew scarcely anyone, being all the more glad of a\ncompanion, while Mme. de Franquetot, who, on the contrary, was extremely\npopular, thought it effective and original to shew all her fine friends\nthat she preferred to their company that of an obscure country cousin with\nwhom she had childish memories in common. Filled with ironical melancholy,\nSwann watched them as they listened to the pianoforte inter, mezzo\n(Liszt’s ’Saint Francis preaching to the birds’) which came after the\nflute, and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy flight; Mme. de Franquetot\nanxiously, her eyes starting from her head, as though the keys over which\nhis fingers skipped with such agility were a series of trapezes, from any\none of which he might come crashing, a hundred feet, to the ground,\nstealing now and then a glance of astonishment and unbelief at her\ncompanion, as who should say: “It isn’t possible, I would never have\nbelieved that a human being could do all that!\"; Mme. de Cambremer, as a\nwoman who had received a sound musical education, beating time with her\nhead–transformed for the nonce into the pendulum of a metronome, the\nsweep and rapidity of whose movements from one shoulder to the other\n(performed with that look of wild abandonment in her eye which a sufferer\nshews who is no longer able to analyse his pain, nor anxious to master it,\nand says merely “I can’t help it”) so increased that at every moment her\ndiamond earrings caught in the trimming of her bodice, and she was obliged\nto put straight the bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair,\nthough without any interruption of her constantly accelerated motion. On\nthe other side (and a little way in front) of Mme. de Franquetot, was the\nMarquise de Gallardon, absorbed in her favourite meditation, namely upon\nher own kinship with the Guermantes family, from which she derived both\npublicly and in private a good deal of glory no unmingled with shame, the\nmost brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her,\nperhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman, or because she was a\nscandalous old woman, or because she came of an inferior branch of the\nfamily, or very possibly for no reason at all. When she found herself\nseated next to some one whom she did not know, as she was at this moment\nnext to Mme. de Franquetot, she suffered acutely from the feeling that her\nown consciousness of her Guermantes connection could not be made\nexternally manifest in visible character like those which, in the\nmosaics in Byzantine churches, placed one beneath another, inscribe in a\nvertical column by the side of some Sacred Personage the words which he is\nsupposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact that\nshe had never received an invitation, or even call, from her young cousin\nthe Princesse des Laumes, during the six years that had already elapsed\nsince the latter’s marriage. The thought filled her with anger–and with\npride; for, by virtue of having told everyone who expressed surprise at\nnever seeing her at Mme. des Laumes’s, that it was because of the risk of\nmeeting the Princesse Mathilde there–a degradation which her own family,\nthe truest and bluest of Legitimists, would never have forgiven her, she\nhad come gradually to believe that this actually was the reason for her\nnot visiting her young cousin. She remembered, it is true, that she had\nseveral times inquired of Mme. des Laumes how they might contrive to meet,\nbut she remembered it only in a confused way, and besides did more than\nneutralise this slightly humiliating reminiscence by murmuring, “After\nall, it isn’t for me to take the first step; I am at least twenty years\nolder than she is.” And fortified by these unspoken words she flung her\nshoulders proudly back until they seemed to part company with her bust,\nwhile her head, which lay almost horizontally upon them, made one think of\nthe ’stuck-on’ head of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally\nadorned with its feathers. Not that she in the least degree resembled a\npheasant, having been endowed by nature with a short and squat and\nmasculine figure; but successive mortifications had given her a backward\ntilt, such as one may observe in trees which have taken root on the very\nedge of a precipice and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their\nbalance. Since she was obliged, in order to console herself for not being\nquite on a level with the rest of the Guermantes, to repeat to herself\nincessantly that it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her\nprinciples and pride that she saw so little of them, the constant\niteration had gradually remoulded her body, and had given her a sort of\n’bearing’ which was accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding, and\neven kindled, at times, a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old\ngentlemen in clubs. Had anyone subjected Mme. de Gallardon’s conversation\nto that form of analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its\nseveral terms would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message, he\nwould at once have remarked that no expression, not even the commonest\nforms of speech, occurred in it nearly so often as “at my cousins the\nGuermantes’s,” “at my aunt Guermantes’s,” “Elzéar de Guermantes’s health,\"\n\"my cousin Guermantes’s box.” If anyone spoke to her of a distinguished\npersonage, she would reply that, although she was not personally\nacquainted with him, she had seen him hundreds of times at her aunt\nGuermantes’s, but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone, with such a\nhollow sound, that it was at once quite clear that if she did not know the\ncelebrity personally that was because of all the obstinate, ineradicable\nprinciples against which her arching shoulders were stretched back to\nrest, as on one of those ladders on which gymnastic instructors make us\n’extend’ so as to develop the expansion of our chests.",
        "At this moment the Princesse des Laumes, who had not been expected to\nappear at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s that evening, did in fact arrive.  To\nshew that she did not wish any special attention, in a house to which she\nhad come by an act of condescension, to be paid to her superior rank, she\nhad entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides, even when\nthere was no crowd to be squeezed through, no one attempting to get past\nher; staying purposely at the back, with the air of being in her proper\nplace, like a king who stands in the waiting procession at the doors of a\ntheatre where the management have not been warned of his coming; and\nstrictly limiting her field of vision–so as not to seem to be advertising\nher presence and claiming the consideration that was her due–to the study\nof a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt, she stood there on the\nspot which had struck her as the most modest (and from which, as she very\nwell knew, a cry of rapture from Mme. de Saint-Euverte would extricate her\nas soon as her presence there was noticed), next to Mme. de Cambremer,\nwhom, however, she did not know. She observed the dumb-show by which her\nneighbour was expressing her passion for music, but she refrained from\ncopying it. This was not to say that, for once that she had consented to\nspend a few minutes in Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s house, the Princesse des\nLaumes would not have wished (so that the act of politeness to her hostess\nwhich she had performed by coming might, so to speak, ’count double’) to\nshew herself as friendly and obliging as possible. But she had a natural\nhorror of what she called ’exaggerating,’ and always made a point of\nletting people see that she ’simply must not’ indulge in any display of\nemotion that was not in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she\nmoved, although such displays never failed to make an impression upon her,\nby virtue of that spirit of imitation, akin to timidity, which is\ndeveloped in the most self-confident persons, by contact with an\nunfamiliar environment, even though it be inferior to their own. She began\nto ask herself whether these gesticulations might not, perhaps, be a\nnecessary concomitant of the piece of music that was being played, a piece\nwhich, it might be, was in a different category from all the music that\nshe had ever heard before; and whether to abstain from them was not a sign\nof her own inability to understand the music, and of discourtesy towards\nthe lady of the house; with the result that, in order to express by a\ncompromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn, at one moment\nshe would merely straighten her shoulder-straps or feel in her golden hair\nfor the little balls of coral or of pink enamel, frosted with tiny\ndiamonds, which formed its simple but effective ornament, studying, with a\ncold interest, her impassioned neighbour, while at another she would beat\ntime for a few bars with her fan, but, so as not to forfeit her\nindependence, she would beat a different time from the pianist’s. When he\nhad finished the Liszt Intermezzo and had begun a Prelude by Chopin, Mme.\nde Cambremer turned to Mme. de Franquetot with a tender smile, full of\nintimate reminiscence, as well as of satisfaction (that of a competent\njudge) with the performance. She had been taught in her girlhood to fondle\nand cherish those long-necked, sinuous creatures, the phrases of Chopin,\nso free, so flexible, so tactile, which begin by seeking their ultimate\nresting-place somewhere beyond and far wide of the direction in which they\nstarted, the point which one might have expected them to reach, phrases\nwhich divert themselves in those fantastic bypaths only to return more\ndeliberately–with a more premeditated reaction, with more precision, as\non a crystal bowl which, if you strike it, will ring and throb until you\ncry aloud in anguish–to clutch at one’s heart.",
        "Brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors, hardly\never invited to a ball, she had fuddled her mind, in the solitude of her\nold manor-house, over setting the pace, now crawling-slow, now passionate,\nwhirling, breathless, for all those imaginary waltzing couples, gathering\nthem like flowers, leaving the ball-room for a moment to listen, where the\nwind sighed among the pine-trees, on the shore of the lake, and seeing of\na sudden advancing towards her, more different from anything one had ever\ndreamed of than earthly lovers are, a slender young man, whose voice was\nresonant and strange and false, in white gloves. But nowadays the\nold-fashioned beauty of this music seemed to have become a trifle stale.\nHaving forfeited, some years back, the esteem of ’really musical’ people,\nit had lost its distinction and its charm, and even those whose taste was\nfrankly bad had ceased to find in it more than a moderate pleasure to\nwhich they hardly liked to confess. Mme. de Cambremer cast a furtive\nglance behind her. She knew that her young daughter-in-law (full of\nrespect for her new and noble family, except in such matters as related to\nthe intellect, upon which, having ’got as far’ as Harmony and the Greek\nalphabet, she was specially enlightened) despised Chopin, and fell quite\nill when she heard him played. But finding herself free from the scrutiny\nof this Wagnerian, who was sitting, at some distance, in a group of her\nown contemporaries, Mme. de Cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of\nexquisite memories and sensations. The Princesse des Laumes was touched\nalso. Though without any natural gift for music, she had received, some\nfifteen years earlier, the instruction which a music-mistress of the\nFaubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been, towards the end of\nher life, reduced to penury, had started, at seventy, to give to the\ndaughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. This lady was now dead.\nBut her method, an echo of her charming touch, came to life now and then\nin the fingers of her pupils, even of those who had been in other respects\nquite mediocre, had given up music, and hardly ever opened a piano. And so\nMme. des Laumes could let her head sway to and fro, fully aware of the\ncause, with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which the pianist was\nrendering this Prelude, since she knew it by heart. The closing notes of\nthe phrase that he had begun sounded already on her lips.  And she\nmurmured “How charming it is!” with a stress on the opening consonants of\nthe adjective, a token of her refinement by which she felt her lips so\nromantically compressed, like the petals of a beautiful, budding flower,\nthat she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony, illuminating them\nfor a moment with a vague and sentimental gaze. Meanwhile Mme.  de\nGallardon had arrived at the point of saying to herself how annoying it\nwas that she had so few opportunities of meeting the Princesse des Laumes,\nfor she meant to teach her a lesson by not acknowledging her bow. She did\nnot know that her cousin was in the room. A movement of Mme. Franquetot’s\nhead disclosed the Princess. At once Mme. de Gallardon dashed towards her,\nupsetting all her neighbours; although determined to preserve a distant\nand glacial manner which should remind everyone present that she had no\ndesire to remain on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might\nfind oneself, any day, cheek by jowl with the Princesse Mathilde, and to\nwhom it was not her duty to make advances since she was not ’of her\ngeneration,’ she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by\nsome non-committal remark which would justify her overture and would force\nthe Princess to engage in conversation; and so, when she reached her\ncousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a stern countenance and one hand thrust\nout as though she were trying to ’force’ a card, began with: “How is your\nhusband?” in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the Prince\nhad been seriously ill. The Princess, breaking into a laugh which was one\nof her characteristics, and was intended at once to shew the rest of an\nassembly that she was making fun of some one and also to enhance her own\nbeauty by concentrating her features around her animated lips and\nsparkling eyes, answered: “Why; he’s never been better in his life!” And\nshe went on laughing.",
        "Mme. de Gallardon then drew herself up and, chilling her expression still\nfurther, perhaps because she was still uneasy about the Prince’s health,\nsaid to her cousin:",
        "“Oriane,” (at once Mme. des Laumes looked with amused astonishment towards\nan invisible third, whom she seemed to call to witness that she had never\nauthorised Mme. de Gallardon to use her Christian name) “I should be so\npleased if you would look in, just for a minute, to-morrow evening, to\nhear a quintet, with the clarinet, by Mozart. I should like to have your\nopinion of it.”",
        "She seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking favour,\nand to want the Princess’s opinion of the Mozart quintet just though it\nhad been a dish invented by a new cook, whose talent it was most important\nthat an epicure should come to judge.",
        "“But I know that quintet quite well. I can tell you now–that I adore it.”",
        "“You know, my husband isn’t at all well; it’s his liver. He would like so\nmuch to see you,” Mme. de Gallardon resumed, making it now a corporal work\nof charity for the Princess to appear at her party.",
        "The Princess never liked to tell people that she would not go to their\nhouses. Every day she would write to express her regret at having been\nkept away–by the sudden arrival of her husband’s mother, by an invitation\nfrom his brother, by the Opera, by some excursion to the country–from\nsome party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of going.  In this\nway she gave many people the satisfaction of feeling that she was on\nintimate terms with them, that she would gladly have come to their houses,\nand that she had been prevented from doing so only by some princely\noccurrence which they were flattered to find competing with their own\nhumble entertainment. And then, as she belonged to that witty ’Guermantes\nset’–in which there survived something of the alert mentality, stripped\nof all commonplace phrases and conventional sentiments, which dated from\nMérimée, and found its final expression in the plays of Meilhac and\nHalévy–she adapted its formula so as to suit even her social engagements,\ntransposed it into the courtesy which was always struggling to be positive\nand precise, to approximate itself to the plain truth. She would never\ndevelop at any length to a hostess the expression of her anxiety to be\npresent at her party; she found it more pleasant to disclose to her all\nthe various little incidents on which it would depend whether it was or\nwas not possible for her to come.",
        "“Listen, and I’ll explain,” she began to Mme. de Gallardon. “To-morrow\nevening I must go to a friend of mine, who has been pestering me to fix a\nday for ages. If she takes us to the theatre afterwards, then I can’t\npossibly come to you, much as I should love to; but if we just stay in the\nhouse, I know there won’t be anyone else there, so I can slip away.”",
        "“Tell me, have you seen your friend M. Swann?”",
        "“No! my precious Charles! I never knew he was here. Where is he? I must\ncatch his eye.”",
        "“It’s a funny thing that he should come to old Saint-Euverte’s,” Mme.  de\nGallardon went on. “Oh, I know he’s very clever,” meaning by that ’very\ncunning,’ “but that makes no difference; fancy a Jew here, and she the\nsister and sister-in-law of two Archbishops.”",
        "“I am ashamed to confess that I am not in the least shocked,” said the\nPrincesse des Laumes.",
        "“I know he’s a converted Jew, and all that, and his parents and\ngrandparents before him. But they do say that the converted ones are worse\nabout their religion than the practising ones, that it’s all just a\npretence; is that true, d’you think?”",
        "“I can throw no light at all on the matter.”",
        "The pianist, who was ’down’ to play two pieces by Chopin, after finishing\nthe Prelude had at once attacked a Polonaise. But once Mme. de Gallardon\nhad informed her cousin that Swann was in the room, Chopin himself might\nhave risen from the grave and played all his works in turn without Mme.\ndes Laumes’s paying him the slightest attention. She belonged to that one\nof the two divisions of the human race in which the untiring curiosity\nwhich the other half feels about the people whom it does not know is\nreplaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it does. As with many\nwomen of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence, in any room in which\nshe might find herself, of another member of her set, even although she\nhad nothing in particular to say to him, would occupy her mind to the\nexclusion of every other consideration. From that moment, in the hope that\nSwann would catch sight of her, the Princess could do nothing but (like a\ntame white mouse when a lump of sugar is put down before its nose and then\ntaken away) turn her face, in which were crowded a thousand signs of\nintimate connivance, none of them with the least relevance to the\nsentiment underlying Chopin’s music, in the direction where Swann was,\nand, if he moved, divert accordingly the course of her magnetic smile.",
        "“Oriane, don’t be angry with me,” resumed Mme. de Gallardon, who could\nnever restrain herself from sacrificing her highest social ambitions, and\nthe hope that she might one day emerge into a light that would dazzle the\nworld, to the immediate and secret satisfaction of saying something\ndisagreeable, “people do say about your M. Swann that he’s the sort of man\none can’t have in the house; is that true?”",
        "“Why, you, of all people, ought to know that it’s true,” replied the\nPrincesse des Laumes, “for you must have asked him a hundred times, and\nhe’s never been to your house once.”",
        "And leaving her cousin mortified afresh, she broke out again into a laugh\nwhich scandalised everyone who was trying to listen to the music, but\nattracted the attention of Mme. de Saint-Euverte, who had stayed, out of\npoliteness, near the piano, and caught sight of the Princess now for the\nfirst time. Mme. de Saint-Euverte was all the more delighted to see Mme.\ndes Laumes, as she imagined her to be still at Guermantes, looking after\nher father-in-law, who was ill.",
        "“My dear Princess, you here?”",
        "“Yes, I tucked myself away in a corner, and I’ve been hearing such lovely\nthings.”",
        "“What, you’ve been in the room quite a time?”",
        "“Oh, yes, quite a long time, which seemed very short; it was only long\nbecause I couldn’t see you.”",
        "Mme. de Saint-Euverte offered her own chair to the Princess, who declined\nit with:",
        "“Oh, please, no! Why should you? It doesn’t matter in the least where\nI sit.” And deliberately picking out, so as the better to display the\nsimplicity of a really great lady, a low seat without a back: “There now,\nthat hassock, that’s all I want. It will make me keep my back straight.\nOh!  Good heavens, I’m making a noise again; they’ll be telling you to\nhave me ’chucked out’.”",
        "Meanwhile, the pianist having doubled his speed, the emotion of the\nmusic-lovers was reaching its climax, a servant was handing refreshments\nabout on a salver, and was making the spoons rattle, and, as on every\nother ’party-night’, Mme. de Saint-Euverte was making signs to him, which\nhe never saw, to leave the room. A recent bride, who had been told that a\nyoung woman ought never to appear bored, was smiling vigorously, trying to\ncatch her hostess’s eye so as to flash a token of her gratitude for the\nother’s having ’thought of her’ in connection with so delightful an\nentertainment. And yet, although she remained more calm than Mme. de\nFranquetot, it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the\nflying fingers; what alarmed her being not the pianist’s fate but the\npiano’s, on which a lighted candle, jumping at each fortissimo,\nthreatened, if not to set its shade on fire, at least to spill wax upon\nthe ebony. At last she could contain herself no longer, and, running up\nthe two steps of the platform on which the piano stood, flung herself on\nthe candle to adjust its sconce. But scarcely had her hand come within\nreach of it when, on a final chord, the piece finished, and the pianist\nrose to his feet. Nevertheless the bold initiative shewn by this young\nwoman and the moment of blushing confusion between her and the pianist\nwhich resulted from it, produced an impression that was favourable on the\nwhole.",
        "“Did you see what that girl did just now, Princess?” asked General de\nFroberville, who had come up to Mme. des Laumes as her hostess left her\nfor a moment. “Odd, wasn’t it? Is she one of the performers?”",
        "“No, she’s a little Mme. de Cambremer,” replied the Princess carelessly,\nand then, with more animation: “I am only repeating what I heard just now,\nmyself; I haven’t the faintest notion who said it, it was some one behind\nme who said that they were neighbours of Mme. de Saint-Euverte in the\ncountry, but I don’t believe anyone knows them, really. They must be\n’country cousins’! By the way, I don’t know whether you’re particularly\n’well-up’ in the brilliant society which we see before us, because I’ve no\nidea who all these astonishing people can be. What do you suppose they do\nwith themselves when they’re not at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s parties? She\nmust have ordered them in with the musicians and the chairs and the food.\n’Universal providers,’ you know. You must admit, they’re rather splendid,\nGeneral. But can she really have the courage to hire the same ’supers’\nevery week? It isn’t possible!”",
        "“Oh, but Cambremer is quite a good name; old, too,” protested the General.",
        "“I see no objection to its being old,” the Princess answered dryly, “but\nwhatever else it is it’s not euphonious,” she went on, isolating the word\neuphonious as though between inverted commas, a little affectation to\nwhich the Guermantes set were addicted.",
        "“You think not, eh! She’s a regular little peach, though,” said the\nGeneral, whose eyes never strayed from Mme. de Cambremer. “Don’t you agree\nwith me, Princess?”",
        "“She thrusts herself forward too much; I think, in so young a woman,\nthat’s not very nice–for I don’t suppose she’s my generation,” replied\nMme. des Laumes (the last word being common, it appeared, to Gallardon and\nGuermantes). And then, seeing that M. de Froberville was still gazing at\nMme. de Cambremer, she added, half out of malice towards the lady, half\nwishing to oblige the General: “Not very nice... for her husband!  I am\nsorry that I do not know her, since she seems to attract you so much; I\nmight have introduced you to her,” said the Princess, who, if she had\nknown the young woman, would most probably have done nothing of the sort.\n\"And now I must say good night, because one of my friends is having a\nbirthday party, and I must go and wish her many happy returns,” she\nexplained, modestly and with truth, reducing the fashionable gathering to\nwhich she was going to the simple proportions of a ceremony which would be\nboring in the extreme, but at which she was obliged to be present, and\nthere would be something touching about her appearance. “Besides, I must\npick up Basin. While I’ve been here, he’s gone to see those friends of\nhis–you know them too, I’m sure,–who are called after a bridge–oh, yes,\nthe Iénas.”",
        "“It was a battle before it was a bridge, Princess; it was a victory!” said\nthe General. “I mean to say, to an old soldier like me,” he went on,\nwiping his monocle and replacing it, as though he were laying a fresh\ndressing on the raw wound underneath, while the Princess instinctively\nlooked away, “that Empire nobility, well, of course, it’s not the same\nthing, but, after all, taking it as it is, it’s very fine of its kind;\nthey were people who really did fight like heroes.”",
        "“But I have the deepest respect for heroes,” the Princess assented, though\nwith a faint trace of irony. “If I don’t go with Basin to see this\nPrincesse d’Iéna, it isn’t for that, at all; it’s simply because I don’t\nknow them. Basin knows them; he worships them. Oh, no, it’s not what you\nthink; he’s not in love with her. I’ve nothing to set my face against!\nBesides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face against them?\"\nshe queried sadly, for the whole world knew that, ever since the day upon\nwhich the Prince des Laumes had married his fascinating cousin, he had\nbeen consistently unfaithful to her. “Anyhow, it isn’t that at all.\nThey’re people he has known for ever so long, they do him very well, and\nthat suits me down to the ground. But I must tell you what he’s told me\nabout their house; it’s quite enough. Can you imagine it, all their\nfurniture is ’Empire’!”",
        "“But, my dear Princess, that’s only natural; it belonged to their\ngrandparents.”",
        "“I don’t quite say it didn’t, but that doesn’t make it any less ugly. I\nquite understand that people can’t always have nice things, but at least\nthey needn’t have things that are merely grotesque. What do you say? I can\nthink of nothing more devastating, more utterly smug than that hideous\nstyle–cabinets covered all over with swans’ heads, like bath-taps!”",
        "“But I believe, all the same, that they’ve got some lovely things; why,\nthey must have that famous mosaic table on which the Treaty of...”",
        "“Oh, I don’t deny, they may have things that are interesting enough from\nthe historic point of view. But things like that can’t, ever, be beautiful\n... because they’re simply horrible! I’ve got things like that myself,\nthat came to Basin from the Montesquious. Only, they’re up in the attics\nat Guermantes, where nobody ever sees them. But, after all, that’s not the\npoint, I would fly to see them, with Basin; I would even go to see them\namong all their sphinxes and brasses, if I knew them, but–I don’t know\nthem! D’you know, I was always taught, when I was a little girl, that it\nwas not polite to call on people one didn’t know.” She assumed a tone of\nchildish gravity. “And so I am just doing what I was taught to do.  Can’t\nyou see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into\ntheir house? Why, I might get a most hostile reception.”",
        "And she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had\nbrought to her lips, by giving to her blue eyes, which were fixed on the\nGeneral, a gentle, dreamy expression.",
        "“My dear Princess, you know that they’d be simply wild with joy.”",
        "“No, why?” she inquired, with the utmost vivacity, either so as to seem\nunaware that it would be because she was one of the first ladies in\nFrance, or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the General tell her so.\n\"Why?  How can you tell? Perhaps they would think it the most unpleasant\nthing that could possibly happen. I know nothing about them, but if\nthey’re anything like me, I find it quite boring enough to see the people\nI do know; I’m sure if I had to see people I didn’t know as well, even if\nthey had ’fought like heroes,’ I should go stark mad. Besides, except when\nit’s an old friend like you, whom one knows quite apart from that, I’m not\nsure that ’heroism’ takes one very far in society. It’s often quite boring\nenough to have to give a dinner-party, but if one had to offer one’s arm\nto Spartacus, to let him take one down...! Really, no; it would never be\nVercingetorix I should send for, to make a fourteenth. I feel sure, I\nshould keep him for really big ’crushes.’ And as I never give any...”",
        "“Ah! Princess, it’s easy to see you’re not a Guermantes for nothing.  You\nhave your share of it, all right, the ’wit of the Guermantes’!”",
        "“But people always talk about the wit of the Guermantes; I never could\nmake out why. Do you really know any others who have it?” she rallied him,\nwith a rippling flow of laughter, her features concentrated, yoked to the\nservice of her animation, her eyes sparkling, blazing with a radiant\nsunshine of gaiety which could be kindled only by such speeches–even if\nthe Princess had to make them herself–as were in praise of h wit or of\nher beauty. “Look, there’s Swann talking to your Cambremer woman; over\nthere, beside old Saint-Euverte, don’t you see him? Ask him to introduce\nyou. But hurry up, he seems to be just going!”",
        "“Did you notice how dreadfully ill he’s looking?” asked the General.",
        "“My precious Charles? Ah, he’s coming at last; I was beginning to think he\ndidn’t want to see me!”",
        "Swann was extremely fond of the Princesse des Laumes, and the sight of her\nrecalled to him Guermantes, a property close to Combray, and all that\ncountry which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit, so as not to be\nseparated from Odette. Slipping into the manner, half-artistic,\nhalf-amorous–with which he could always manage to amuse the Princess–a\nmanner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment\ninto the old social atmosphere, and wishing also to express in words, for\nhis own satisfaction, the longing that he felt for the country:",
        "“Ah!” he exclaimed, or rather intoned, in such a way as to be audible at\nonce to Mme. de Saint-Euverte, to whom he spoke, and to Mme. des Laumes,\nfor whom he was speaking, “Behold our charming Princess! See, she has come\nup on purpose from Guermantes to hear Saint Francis preach to the birds,\nand has only just had time, like a dear little tit-mouse, to go and pick a\nfew little hips and haws and put them in her hair; there are even some\ndrops of dew upon them still, a little of the hoar-frost which must be\nmaking the Duchess, down there, shiver. It is very pretty indeed, my dear\nPrincess.”",
        "“What! The Princess came up on purpose from Guermantes? But that’s too\nwonderful! I never knew; I’m quite bewildered,” Mme. de Saint-Euverte\nprotested with quaint simplicity, being but little accustomed to Swann’s\nway of speaking. And then, examining the Princess’s headdress, “Why,\nyou’re quite right; it is copied from... what shall I say, not chestnuts,\nno,–oh, it’s a delightful idea, but how can the Princess have known what\nwas going to be on my programme? The musicians didn’t tell me, even.”",
        "Swann, who was accustomed, when he was with a woman whom he had kept up\nthe habit of addressing in terms of gallantry, to pay her delicate\ncompliments which most other people would not and need not understand, did\nnot condescend to explain to Mme. de Saint-Euverte that he had been\nspeaking metaphorically. As for the Princess, she was in fits of laughter,\nboth because Swann’s wit was highly appreciated by her set, and because\nshe could never hear a compliment addressed to herself without finding it\nexquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing.",
        "“Indeed! I’m delighted, Charles, if my little hips and haws meet with your\napproval. But tell me, why did you bow to that Cambremer person, are you\nalso her neighbour in the country?”",
        "Mme. de Saint-Euverte, seeing that the Princess seemed quite happy talking\nto Swann, had drifted away.",
        "“But you are, yourself, Princess!”",
        "“I! Why, they must have ’countries’ everywhere, those creatures! Don’t I\nwish I had!”",
        "“No, not the Cambremers; her own people. She was a Legrandin, and used to\ncome to Combray. I don’t know whether you are aware that you are Comtesse\nde Combray, and that the Chapter owes you a due.”",
        "“I don’t know what the Chapter owes me, but I do know that I’m ’touched’\nfor a hundred francs, every year, by the Curé, which is a due that I could\nvery well do without. But surely these Cambremers have rather a startling\nname. It ends just in time, but it ends badly!” she said with a laugh.",
        "“It begins no better.” Swann took the point.",
        "“Yes; that double abbreviation!”",
        "“Some one very angry and very proper who didn’t dare to finish the first\nword.”",
        "“But since he couldn’t stop himself beginning the second, he’d have done\nbetter to finish the first and be done with it. We are indulging in the\nmost refined form of humour, my dear Charles, in the very best of\ntaste–but how tiresome it is that I never see you now,” she went on in a\ncoaxing tone, “I do so love talking to you. Just imagine, I could not make\nthat idiot Froberville see that there was anything funny about the name\nCambremer.  Do agree that life is a dreadful business. It’s only when I\nsee you that I stop feeling bored.”",
        "Which was probably not true. But Swann and the Princess had the same way\nof looking at the little things of life–the effect, if not the cause of\nwhich was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of\npronunciation. This similarity was not striking because no two things\ncould have been more unlike than their voices. But if one took the trouble\nto imagine Swann’s utterances divested of the sonority that enwrapped\nthem, of the moustache from under which they emerged, one found that they\nwere the same phrases, the same inflexions, that they had the ’tone’ of\nthe Guermantes set. On important matters, Swann and the Princess had not\nan idea in common. But since Swann had become so melancholy, and was\nalways in that trembling condition which precedes a flood of tears, he had\nthe same need to speak about his grief that a murderer has to tell some\none about his crime. And when he heard the Princess say that life was a\ndreadful business, he felt as much comforted as if she had spoken to him\nof Odette.",
        "“Yes, life is a dreadful business! We must meet more often, my dear\nfriend. What is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful. We could\nspend a most pleasant evening together.”",
        "“I’m sure we could; why not come down to Guermantes? My mother-in-law\nwould be wild with joy. It’s supposed to be very ugly down there, but I\nmust say, I find the neighborhood not at all unattractive; I have a horror\nof ’picturesque spots’.”",
        "“I know it well, it’s delightful!” replied Swann. “It’s almost too\nbeautiful, too much alive for me just at present; it’s a country to be\nhappy in. It’s perhaps because I have lived there, but things there speak\nto me so. As soon as a breath of wind gets up, and the cornfields begin to\nstir, I feel that some one is going to appear suddenly, that I am going to\nhear some news; and those little houses by the water’s edge... I should be\nquite wretched!”",
        "“Oh! my dearest Charles, do take care; there’s that appalling Rampillon\nwoman; she’s seen me; hide me somewhere, do tell me again, quickly, what\nit was that happened to her; I get so mixed up; she’s just married off her\ndaughter, or her lover (I never can remember),–perhaps both–to each\nother! Oh, no, I remember now, she’s been dropped by her Prince... Pretend\nto be talking, so that the poor old Berenice sha’n’t come and invite me to\ndinner. Anyhow, I’m going. Listen, my dearest Charles, now that I have\nseen you, once in a blue moon, won’t you let me carry you off and take you\nto the Princesse de Parme’s, who would be so pleased to see you (you\nknow), and Basin too, for that matter; he’s meeting me there. If one\ndidn’t get news of you, sometimes, from Mémé...  Remember, I never see you\nat all now!”",
        "Swann declined. Having told M. de Charlus that, on leaving Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte’s, he would go straight home, he did not care to run the\nrisk, by going on now to the Princesse de Parme’s, of missing a message\nwhich he had, all the time, been hoping to see brought in to him by one of\nthe footmen, during the party, and which he was perhaps going to find left\nwith his own porter, at home.",
        "“Poor Swann,” said Mme. des Laumes that night to her husband; “he is\nalways charming, but he does look so dreadfully unhappy. You will see for\nyourself, for he has promised to dine with us one of these days. I do feel\nthat it’s really absurd that a man of his intelligence should let himself\nbe made to suffer by a creature of that kind, who isn’t even interesting,\nfor they tell me, she’s an absolute idiot!” she concluded with the wisdom\ninvariably shewn by people who, not being in love themselves, feel that a\nclever man ought to be unhappy only about such persons as are worth his\nwhile; which is rather like being astonished that anyone should condescend\nto die of cholera at the bidding of so insignificant a creature as the\ncommon bacillus.",
        "Swann now wished to go home, but, just as he was making his escape,\nGeneral de Froberville caught him and asked for an introduction to Mme.\nde Cambremer, and he was obliged to go back into the room to look for her.",
        "“I say, Swann, I’d rather be married to that little woman than killed by\nsavages, what do you say?”",
        "The words ’killed by savages’ pierced Swann’s aching heart; and at once he\nfelt the need of continuing the conversation. “Ah!” he began, “some fine\nlives have been lost in that way... There was, you remember, that explorer\nwhose remains Dumont d’Urville brought back, La Pérouse...” (and he was at\nonce happy again, as though he had named Odette). “He was a fine\ncharacter, and interests me very much, does La Pérouse,” he ended sadly.",
        "“Oh, yes, of course, La Pérouse,” said the General. “It’s quite a\nwell-known name. There’s a street called that.”",
        "“Do you know anyone in the Rue La Pérouse?” asked Swann excitedly.",
        "“Only Mme. de Chanlivault, the sister of that good fellow Chaussepierre.\nShe gave a most amusing theatre-party the other evening. That’s a house\nthat will be really smart some day, you’ll see!”",
        "“Oh, so she lives in the Rue La Pérouse. It’s attractive; I like that\nstreet; it’s so sombre.”",
        "“Indeed it isn’t. You can’t have been in it for a long time; it’s not at\nall sombre now; they’re beginning to build all round there.”",
        "When Swann did finally introduce M. de Froberville to the young Mme.  de\nCambremer, since it was the first time that she had heard the General’s\nname, she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise\nwith which she would have greeted him if she had never, in the whole of\nher life, heard anything else; for, as she did not yet know all the\nfriends of her new family, whenever anyone was presented to her, she\nassumed that he must be one of them, and thinking that she would shew her\ntact by appearing to have heard ’such a lot about him’ since her marriage,\nshe would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which was meant as a\nproof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to overcome and of\nthe spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame it. And so her\nparents-in-law, whom she still regarded as the most eminent pair in\nFrance, declared that she was an angel; all the more that they preferred\nto appear, in marrying her to their son, to have yielded to the attraction\nrather of her natural charm than of her considerable fortune.",
        "“It’s easy to see that you’re a musician heart and soul, Madame,” said the\nGeneral, alluding to the incident of the candle.",
        "Meanwhile the concert had begun again, and Swann saw that he could not now\ngo before the end of the new number. He suffered greatly from being shut\nup among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded him all\nthe more cruelly since, being ignorant of his love, incapable, had they\nknown of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than smile at it as\nat some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of insanity, they made it\nappear to him in the aspect of a subjective state which existed for\nhimself alone, whose reality there was nothing external to confirm; he\nsuffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which even the sound of the\ninstruments made him want to cry, from having to prolong his exile in this\nplace to which Odette would never come, in which no one, nothing was aware\nof her existence, from which she was entirely absent.",
        "But suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore\nhim with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. What\nhad happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes, on\nwhich it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which it\nprolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation with\nwhich it already saw the expected object approaching, and with a desperate\neffort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before itself expired,\nto keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its remaining strength,\nthat the stranger might enter in, as one holds a door open that would\notherwise automatically close. And before Swann had had time to understand\nwhat was happening, to think: “It is the little phrase from Vinteuil’s\nsonata. I mustn’t listen!”, all his memories of the days when Odette had\nbeen in love with him, which he had succeeded, up till that evening, in\nkeeping invisible in the depths of his being, deceived by this sudden\nreflection of a season of love, whose sun, they supposed, had dawned\nagain, had awakened from their slumber, had taken wing and risen to sing\nmaddeningly in his ears, without pity for his present desolation, the\nforgotten strains of happiness.",
        "In place of the abstract expressions “the time when I was happy,” “the\ntime when I was loved,” which he had often used until then, and without\nmuch suffering, for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything of\nthe past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the reality, he\nnow recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the peculiar, volatile\nessence of that lost happiness; he could see it all; the snowy, curled\npetals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed after him into his\ncarriage, which he had kept pressed to his lips, the address ’Maison\nDorée,’ embossed on the note-paper on which he had read “My hand trembles\nso as I write to you,” the frowning contraction of her eyebrows when she\nsaid pleadingly: “You won’t let it be very long before you send for me?\";\nhe could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he used to have in to\nsinge his hair while Loredan went to fetch the little working girl; could\nfeel the torrents of rain which fell so often that spring, the ice-cold\nhomeward drive in his victoria, by moonlight; all the network of mental\nhabits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory reactions, which had\nextended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes, by which his body now\nfound itself inextricably held. At that time he had been satisfying a\nsensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures of those people who\nlived for love alone.  He had supposed that he could stop there, that he\nwould not be obliged to learn their sorrows also; how small a thing the\nactual charm of Odette was now in comparison with that formidable terror\nwhich extended it like a cloudy halo all around her, that enormous anguish\nof not knowing at every hour of the day and night what she had been doing,\nof not possessing her wholly, at all times and in all places! Alas, he\nrecalled the accents in which she had exclaimed: “But I can see you at any\ntime; I am always free!\"–she, who was never free now; the interest, the\ncuriosity that she had shewn in his life, her passionate desire that he\nshould do her the favour–of which it was he who, then, had felt\nsuspicious, as of a possibly tedious waste of his time and disturbance of\nhis arrangements–of granting her access to his study; how she had been\nobliged to beg that he would let her take him to the Verdurins’; and, when\nhe did allow her to come to him once a month, how she had first, before he\nwould let himself be swayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her,\nthat custom of their seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at\na time when to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which,\nsince that time, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken\nherself of it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a\nneed. Little had he suspected how truly he spoke when, on their third\nmeeting, as she repeated: “But why don’t you let me come to you oftener?\"\nhe had told her, laughing, and in a vein of gallantry, that it was for\nfear of forming a hopeless passion.  Now, alas, it still happened at times\nthat she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel, on paper which bore a\nprinted address, but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart.\n\"Written from the Hôtel Vouillemont.  What on earth can she have gone\nthere for? With whom? What happened there?” He remembered the gas-jets\nthat were being extinguished along the Boulevard des Italiens when he had\nmet her, when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that night\nwhich had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now (that night of a\nperiod when he had not even to ask himself whether he would be annoying\nher by looking for her and by finding her, so certain was he that she knew\nno greater happiness than to see him and to let him take her home)\nbelonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may return again\nonce its doors are closed. And Swann could distinguish, standing,\nmotionless, before that scene of happiness in which it lived again, a\nwretched figure which filled him with such pity, because he did not at\nfirst recognise who it was, that he must lower his head, lest anyone\nshould observe that his eyes were filled with tears.  It was himself.",
        "When he had realised this, his pity ceased; he was jealous, now, of that\nother self whom she had loved, he was jealous of those men of whom he had\nso often said, without much suffering: “Perhaps she’s in love with them,\"\nnow that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving, in which there is no\nlove, for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the ’letter-heading’ of the\nMaison d’Or; for they were full of love. And then, his anguish becoming\ntoo keen, he passed his hand over his forehead, let the monocle drop from\nhis eye, and wiped its glass. And doubtless, if he had caught sight of\nhimself at that moment, he would have added to the collection of the\nmonocles which he had already identified, this one which he removed, like\nan importunate, worrying thought, from his head, while from its misty\nsurface, with his handkerchief, he sought to obliterate his cares.",
        "There are in the music of the violin–if one does not see the instrument\nitself, and so cannot relate what one hears to its form, which modifies\nthe fullness of the sound–accents which are so closely akin to those of\ncertain contralto voices, that one has the illusion that a singer has\ntaken her place amid the orchestra. One raises one’s eyes; one sees only\nthe wooden case, magical as a Chinese box; but, at moments, one is still\ntricked by the deceiving appeal of the Siren; at times, too, one believes\nthat one is listening to a captive spirit, struggling in the darkness of\nits masterful box, a box quivering with enchantment, like a devil immersed\nin a stoup of holy water; sometimes, again, it is in the air, at large,\nlike a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the ear, as it\npasses, its invisible message.",
        "As though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little phrase\nas performing the rites on which it insisted before it would consent to\nappear, as proceeding to utter the incantations necessary to procure, and\nto prolong for a few moments, the miracle of its apparition, Swann, who\nwas no more able now to see it than if it had belonged to a world of\nultra-violet light, who experienced something like the refreshing sense of\na metamorphosis in the momentary blindness with which he had been struck\nas he approached it, Swann felt that it was present, like a protective\ngoddess, a confidant of his love, who, so as to be able to come to him\nthrough the crowd, and to draw him aside to speak to him, had disguised\nherself in this sweeping cloak of sound. And as she passed him, light,\nsoothing, as softly murmured as the perfume of a flower, telling him what\nshe had to say, every word of which he closely scanned, sorry to see them\nfly away so fast, he made involuntarily with his lips the motion of\nkissing, as it went by him, the harmonious, fleeting form.",
        "He felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she, who addressed\nherself to him, spoke to him in a whisper of Odette. For he had no longer,\nas of old, the impression that Odette and he were not known to the little\nphrase. Had it not often been the witness of their joys? True that, as\noften, it had warned him of their frailty. And indeed, whereas, in that\ndistant time, he had divined an element of suffering in its smile, in its\nlimpid and disillusioned intonation, to-night he found there rather the\ncharm of a resignation that was almost gay. Of those sorrows, of which the\nlittle phrase had spoken to him then, which he had seen it–without his\nbeing touched by them himself–carry past him, smiling, on its sinuous and\nrapid course, of those sorrows which were now become his own, without his\nhaving any hope of being, ever, delivered from them, it seemed to say to\nhim, as once it had said of his happiness: “What does all that matter; it\nis all nothing.” And Swann’s thoughts were borne for the first time on a\nwave of pity and tenderness towards that Vinteuil, towards that unknown,\nexalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly; what could his\nlife have been? From the depths of what well of sorrow could he have drawn\nthat god-like strength, that unlimited power of creation?",
        "When it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his\nsufferings, Swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which, but a\nlittle while back, had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that he\ncould read it on the faces of indifferent strangers, who would regard his\nlove as a digression that was without importance. ’Twas because the little\nphrase, unlike them, whatever opinion it might hold on the short duration\nof these states of the soul, saw in them something not, as everyone else\nsaw, less serious than the events of everyday life, but, on the contrary,\nso far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy of the trouble of\nexpressing it. Those graces of an intimate sorrow, ’twas them that the\nphrase endeavoured to imitate, to create anew; and even their essence, for\nall that it consists in being incommunicable and in appearing trivial to\neveryone save him who has experience of them, the little phrase had\ncaptured, had rendered visible. So much so that it made their value be\nconfessed, their divine sweetness be tasted by all those same\nonlookers–provided only that they were in any sense musical–who, the\nnext moment, would ignore, would disown them in real life, in every\nindividual love that came into being beneath their eyes. Doubtless the\nform in which it had codified those graces could not be analysed into any\nlogical elements. But ever since, more than a year before, discovering to\nhim many of the riches of his own soul, the love of music had been born,\nand for a time at least had dwelt in him, Swann had regarded musical\nmotifs as actual ideas, of another world, of another order, ideas veiled\nin shadows, unknown, impenetrable by the human mind, which none the less\nwere perfectly distinct one from another, unequal among themselves in\nvalue and in significance. When, after that first evening at the\nVerdurins’, he had had the little phrase played over to him again, and had\nsought to disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that, like\na perfume or a caress, it swept over and enveloped him, he had observed\nthat it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes which\ncomposed it and to the constant repetition of two of them that was due\nthat impression of a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he\nknew that he was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but\nmerely upon certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind’s convenience)\nfor the mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he\nknew the Verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had\nheard the sonata played. He knew that his memory of the piano falsified\nstill further the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field\nopen to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an\nimmeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which, here\nand there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts,\nsome few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of passion, of\ncourage, of serenity, which compose it, each one differing from all the\nrest as one universe differs from another, have been discovered by certain\ngreat artists who do us the service, when they awaken in us the emotion\ncorresponding to the theme which they have found, of shewing us what\nrichness, what variety lies hidden, unknown to us, in that great black\nimpenetrable night, discouraging exploration, of our soul, which we have\nbeen content to regard as valueless and waste and void. Vinteuil had been\none of those musicians. In his little phrase, albeit it presented to the\nmind’s eye a clouded surface, there was contained, one felt, a matter so\nconsistent, so explicit, to which the phrase gave so new, so original a\nforce, that those who had once heard it preserved the memory of it in the\ntreasure-chamber of their minds. Swann would repair to it as to a\nconception of love and happiness, of which at once he knew as well in what\nrespects it was peculiar as he would know of the Princesse de Clèves, or\nof René, should either of those titles occur to him. Even when he was\nnot thinking of the little phrase, it existed, latent, in his mind, in the\nsame way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent, such as\nour notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the rich\npossessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned. Perhaps\nwe shall lose them, perhaps they will be obliterated, if we return to\nnothing in the dust. But so long as we are alive, we can no more bring\nourselves to a state in which we shall not have known them than we can\nwith regard to any material object, than we can, for example, doubt the\nluminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted, in view of the changed\naspect of everything in the room, from which has vanished even the memory\nof the darkness. In that way Vinteuil’s phrase, like some theme, say, in\nTristan, which represents to us also a certain acquisition of sentiment,\nhas espoused our mortal state, had endued a vesture of humanity that was\naffecting enough. Its destiny was linked, for the future, with that of the\nhuman soul, of which it was one of the special, the most distinctive\nornaments. Perhaps it is not-being that is the true state, and all our\ndream of life is without existence; but, if so, we feel that it must be\nthat these phrases of music, these conceptions which exist in relation to\nour dream, are nothing either. We shall perish, but we have for our\nhostages these divine captives who shall follow and share our fate. And\ndeath in their company is something less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps\neven less certain.",
        "So Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata did,\nreally, exist. Human as it was from this point of view, it belonged, none\nthe less, to an order of supernatural creatures whom we have never seen,\nbut whom, in spite of that, we recognise and acclaim with rapture when\nsome explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one forth, to bring it down\nfrom that divine world to which he has access to shine for a brief moment\nin the firmament of ours. This was what Vinteuil had done for the little\nphrase. Swann felt that the composer had been content (with the musical\ninstruments at his disposal) to draw aside its veil, to make it visible,\nfollowing and respecting its outlines with a hand so loving, so prudent,\nso delicate and so sure, that the sound altered at every moment, blunting\nitself to indicate a shadow, springing back into life when it must follow\nthe curve of some more bold projection. And one proof that Swann was not\nmistaken when he believed in the real existence of this phrase, was that\nanyone with an ear at all delicate for music would at once have detected\nthe imposture had Vinteuil, endowed with less power to see and to render\nits forms, sought to dissemble (by adding a line, here and there, of his\nown invention) the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand.",
        "The phrase had disappeared. Swann knew that it would come again at the end\nof the last movement, after a long passage which Mme. Verdurin’s pianist\nalways ’skipped.’ There were in this passage some admirable ideas which\nSwann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata, and which he now\nperceived, as if they had, in the cloakroom of his memory, divested\nthemselves of their uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened to all the\nscattered themes which entered into the composition of the phrase, as its\npremises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a syllogism; he was\nassisting at the mystery of its birth. “Audacity,” he exclaimed to\nhimself, “as inspired, perhaps, as a Lavoisier’s or an Ampere’s, the\naudacity of a Vinteuil making experiment, discovering the secret laws that\ngovern an unknown force, driving across a region unexplored towards the\none possible goal the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and\nwhich he never may discern!” How charming the dialogue which Swann now\nheard between piano and violin, at the beginning of the last passage. The\nsuppression of human speech, so far from letting fancy reign there\nuncontrolled (as one might have thought), had eliminated it altogether.\nNever was spoken language of such inflexible necessity, never had it known\nquestions so pertinent, such obvious replies. At first the piano\ncomplained alone, like a bird deserted by its mate; the violin heard and\nanswered it, as from a neighbouring tree. It was as at the first beginning\nof the world, as if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth, or\nrather in this world closed against all the rest, so fashioned by the\nlogic of its creator that in it there should never be any but themselves;\nthe world of this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul, not yet made\nperfect, of the little phrase, was it a fairy, invisibly somewhere\nlamenting, whose plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated? Its cries\nwere so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch\nthem as they came. Marvellous bird! The violinist seemed to wish to charm,\nto tame, to woo, to win it. Already it had passed into his soul, already\nthe little phrase which it evoked shook like a medium’s the body of the\nviolinist, ’possessed’ indeed.  Swann knew that the phrase was going to\nspeak to him once again.  And his personality was now so divided that the\nstrain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself face\nto face, once more, with the phrase, convulsed him in one of those sobs\nwhich a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring from\nus, not when we are alone, but when we repeat one or the other to a\nfriend, in whom we see ourselves reflected, like a third person, whose\nprobable emotion softens him.  It reappeared, but this time to remain\npoised in the air, and to sport there for a moment only, as though\nimmobile, and shortly to expire. And so Swann lost nothing of the precious\ntime for which it lingered. It was still there, like an iridescent bubble\nthat floats for a while unbroken. As a rainbow, when its brightness fades,\nseems to subside, then soars again and, before it is extinguished, is\nglorified with greater splendour than it has ever shewn; so to the two\ncolours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to appear it added others\nnow, chords shot with every hue in the prism, and made them sing. Swann\ndared not move, and would have liked to compel all the other people in the\nroom to remain still also, as if the slightest movement might embarrass\nthe magic presence, supernatural, delicious, frail, that would so easily\nvanish. But no one, as it happened, dreamed of speaking.  The ineffable\nutterance of one solitary man, absent, perhaps dead (Swann did not know\nwhether Vinteuil were still alive), breathed out above the rites of those\ntwo hierophants, sufficed to arrest the attention of three hundred minds,\nand made of that stage on which a soul was thus called into being one of\nthe noblest altars on which a supernatural ceremony could be performed. It\nfollowed that, when the phrase at last was finished, and only its\nfragmentary echoes floated among the subsequent themes which had already\ntaken its place, if Swann at first was annoyed to see the Comtesse de\nMonteriender, famed for her imbecilities, lean over towards him to confide\nin him her impressions, before even the sonata had come to an end; he\ncould not refrain from smiling, and perhaps also found an underlying\nsense, which she was incapable of perceiving, in the words that she used.\nDazzled by the virtuosity of the performers, the Comtesse exclaimed to\nSwann: “It’s astonishing! I have never seen anything to beat it...” But a\nscrupulous regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion, she\nadded the reservation: “anything to beat it... since the table-turning!”",
        "From that evening, Swann understood that the feeling which Odette had once\nhad for him would never revive, that his hopes of happiness would not be\nrealised now. And the days on which, by a lucky chance, she had once more\nshewn herself kind and loving to him, or if she had paid him any\nattention, he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of a slight\nmovement on her part towards him with the same tender and sceptical\nsolicitude, the desperate joy that people reveal who, when they are\nnursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady, relate, as\nsignificant facts of infinite value: “Yesterday he went through his\naccounts himself, and actually corrected a mistake that we had made in\nadding them up; he ate an egg to-day and seemed quite to enjoy it, if he\ndigests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet to-morrow,\"–although\nthey themselves know that these things are meaningless on the eve of an\ninevitable death. No doubt Swann was assured that if he had now been\nliving at a distance from Odette he would gradually have lost all interest\nin her, so that he would have been glad to learn that she was leaving\nParis for ever; he would have had the courage to remain there; but he had\nnot the courage to go.",
        "He had often thought of going. Now that he was once again at work upon his\nessay on Vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to The\nHague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was certain that a ’Toilet of Diana’\nwhich had been acquired by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a\nNicholas Maes was in reality a Vermeer. And he would have liked to be able\nto examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen his conviction.\nBut to leave Paris while Odette was there, and even when she was not\nthere–for in strange places where our sensations have not been numbed by\nhabit, we refresh, we revive an old pain–was for him so cruel a project\nthat he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it incessantly in his\nmind only because he knew himself to be resolute in his determination\nnever to put it into effect. But it would happen that, while he was\nasleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him (without his\nremembering that this particular tour was impossible) and would be\nrealised. One night he dreamed that he was going away for a year; leaning\nfrom the window of the train towards a young man on the platform who wept\nas he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade this young man to come\naway also. The train began to move; he awoke in alarm, and remembered that\nhe was not going away, that he would see Odette that evening, and next day\nand almost every day. And then, being still deeply moved by his dream, he\nwould thank heaven for those special circumstances which made him\nindependent, thanks to which he could remain in Odette’s vicinity, and\ncould even succeed in making her allow him to see her sometimes; and,\ncounting over the list of his advantages: his social position–his\nfortune, from which she stood too often in need of assistance not to\nshrink from the prospect of a definite rupture (having even, so people\nsaid, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her)–his friendship with\nM. de Charlus, which, it must be confessed, had never won him any very\ngreat favour from Odette, but which gave him the pleasant feeling that she\nwas always hearing complimentary things said about him by this common\nfriend for whom she had so great an esteem–and even his own intelligence,\nthe whole of which he employed in weaving, every day, a fresh plot which\nwould make his presence, if not agreeable, at any rate necessary to Odette\n–he thought of what might have happened to him if all these advantages\nhad been lacking, he thought that, if he had been, like so many other men,\npoor and humble, without resources, forced to undertake any task that\nmight be offered to him, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might\nhave been obliged to part from Odette, that that dream, the terror of\nwhich was still so recent, might well have been true; and he said to\nhimself: “People don’t know when they are happy. They’re never so unhappy\nas they think they are.” But he reflected that this existence had lasted\nalready for several years, that all that he could now hope for was that it\nshould last for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his\nfriends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a\nmeeting which, when it occurred, would bring him no happiness; and he\nasked himself whether he was not mistaken, whether the circumstances that\nhad favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had not\ndone a disservice to his career, whether the outcome to be desired was not\nthat as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in dreams–his own\ndeparture; and he said to himself that people did not know when they were\nunhappy, that they were never so happy as they supposed.",
        "Sometimes he hoped that she would die, painlessly, in some accident, she\nwho was out of doors in the streets, crossing busy thoroughfares, from\nmorning to night. And as she always returned safe and sound, he marvelled\nat the strength, at the suppleness of the human body, which was able\ncontinually to hold in check, to outwit all the perils that environed it\n(which to Swann seemed innumerable, since his own secret desire had strewn\nthem in her path), and so allowed its occupant, the soul, to abandon\nitself, day after day, and almost with impunity, to its career of\nmendacity, to the pursuit of pleasure. And Swann felt a very cordial\nsympathy with that Mahomet II whose portrait by Bellini he admired, who,\non finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives, stabbed\nher, in order, as his Venetian biographer artlessly relates, to recover\nhis spiritual freedom. Then he would be ashamed of thinking thus only of\nhimself, and his own sufferings would seem to deserve no pity now that he\nhimself was disposing so cheaply of Odette’s very life.",
        "Since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent\nreturn, if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations\nhis grief would ultimately have been assuaged, and his love would,\nperhaps, have died. And from the moment when she did not wish to leave\nParis for ever he had hoped that she would never go. As he knew that her\none prolonged absence, every year, was in August and September, he had\nabundant opportunity, several months in advance, to dissociate from it the\ngrim picture of her absence throughout Eternity which was lodged in him by\nanticipation, and which, consisting of days closely akin to the days\nthrough which he was then passing, floated in a cold transparency in his\nmind, which it saddened and depressed, though without causing him any\nintolerable pain. But that conception of the future, that flowing stream,\ncolourless and unconfined, a single word from Odette sufficed to penetrate\nthrough all Swann’s defences, and like a block of ice immobilised it,\ncongealed its fluidity, made it freeze altogether; and Swann felt himself\nsuddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass which pressed on the\ninner walls of his consciousness until he was fain to burst asunder; for\nOdette had said casually, watching him with a malicious smile:\n\"Forcheville is going for a fine trip at Whitsuntide. He’s going to\nEgypt!” and Swann had at once understood that this meant: “I am going to\nEgypt at Whitsuntide with Forcheville.” And, in fact, if, a few days\nlater, Swann began: “About that trip that you told me you were going to\ntake with Forcheville,” she would answer carelessly: “Yes, my dear boy,\nwe’re starting on the 19th; we’ll send you a ’view’ of the Pyramids.” Then\nhe was determined to know whether she was Forcheville’s mistress, to ask\nher point-blank, to insist upon her telling him. He knew that there were\nsome perjuries which, being so superstitious, she would not commit, and\nbesides, the fear, which had hitherto restrained his curiosity, of making\nOdette angry if he questioned her, of making himself odious, had ceased to\nexist now that he had lost all hope of ever being loved by her.",
        "One day he received an anonymous letter which told him that Odette had\nbeen the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among them\nForcheville, M. de Bréauté and the painter) and women, and that she\nfrequented houses of ill-fame. He was tormented by the discovery that\nthere was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of sending\nhim such a letter (for certain details betrayed in the writer a\nfamiliarity with his private life). He wondered who it could be. But he\nhad never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other\npeople, those which had no visible connection with what they said. And\nwhen he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent\ncharacter of M. de Charlus, or of M. des Laumes, or of M. d’Orsan that he\nmust place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might have\nhad its birth; as none of these men had ever, in conversation with Swann,\nsuggested that he approved of anonymous letters, and as everything that\nthey had ever said to him implied that they strongly disapproved, he saw\nno further reason for associating this infamy with the character of any\none of them more than with the rest. M. de Charlus was somewhat inclined\nto eccentricity, but he was fundamentally good and kind; M. des Laumes was\na trifle dry, but wholesome and straight. As for M. d’Orsan, Swann had\nnever met anyone who, even in the most depressing circumstances, would\ncome to him with a more heartfelt utterance, would act more properly or\nwith more discretion. So much so that he was unable to understand the\nrather indelicate part commonly attributed to M. d’Orsan in his relations\nwith a certain wealthy woman, and that whenever he thought of him he was\nobliged to set that evil reputation on one side, as irreconcilable with so\nmany unmistakable proofs of his genuine sincerity and refinement.  For a\nmoment Swann felt that his mind was becoming clouded, and he thought of\nsomething else so as to recover a little light; until he had the courage\nto return to those other reflections. But then, after not having been able\nto suspect anyone, he was forced to suspect everyone that he knew.  After\nall, M. de Charlus might be most fond of him, might be most good-natured;\nbut he was a neuropath; to-morrow, perhaps, he would burst into tears on\nhearing that Swann was ill; and to-day, from jealousy, or in anger, or\ncarried away by some sudden idea, he might have wished to do him a\ndeliberate injury. Really, that kind of man was the worst of all. The\nPrince des Laumes was, certainly, far less devoted to Swann than was M. de\nCharlus. But for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with\nregard to him; and besides, his was a nature which, though, no doubt, it\nwas cold, was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action. Swann\nregretted that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such\npeople. Then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their\nneighbours is fellow-feeling, that he could not, in the last resort,\nanswer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was, so\nfar as the heart went, that of M. de Charlus. The mere thought of causing\nSwann so much distress would have been revolting to him. But with a man\nwho was insensible, of another order of humanity, as was the Prince des\nLaumes, how was one to foresee the actions to which he might be led by the\npromptings of a different nature? To have a good heart was everything, and\nM. de Charlus had one. But M. d’Orsan was not lacking in that either, and\nhis relations with Swann–cordial, but scarcely intimate, arising from the\npleasure which, as they held the same views about everything, they found\nin talking together–were more quiescent than the enthusiastic affection\nof M. de Charlus, who was apt to be led into passionate activity, good or\nevil. If there was anyone by whom Swann felt that he had always been\nunderstood, and (with delicacy) loved, it was M. d’Orsan. Yes, but the\nlife he led; it could hardly be called honourable. Swann regretted that he\nhad never taken any notice of those rumours, that he himself had admitted,\njestingly, that he had never felt so keen a sense of sympathy, or of\nrespect, as when he was in thoroughly ’detrimental’ society. “It is not\nfor nothing,” he now assured himself, “that when people pass judgment upon\ntheir neighbour, their finding is based upon his actions. It is those\nalone that are significant, and not at all what we say or what we think.\nCharlus and des Laumes may have this or that fault, but they are men of\nhonour. Orsan, perhaps, has not the same faults, but he is not a man of\nhonour. He may have acted dishonourably once again.” Then he suspected\nRémi, who, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now\nfelt himself, for a moment, to be on the right track. To begin with,\nLoredan had his own reasons for wishing harm to Odette. And then, how were\nwe not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our\nown, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and\nvices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find\nthemselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own\nclass? He also suspected my grandfather. On every occasion when Swann had\nasked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined? Besides,\nwith his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have thought that\nhe was acting for Swann’s good. He suspected, in turn, Bergotte, the\npainter, the Verdurins; paused for a moment to admire once again the\nwisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the artistic circles in\nwhich such things were possible, were, perhaps, even openly avowed, as\nexcellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of honesty that were to be\nobserved in those Bohemians, and contrasted them with the life of\nexpedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which the want of money,\nthe craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of their pleasures often\ndrove members of the aristocracy. In a word, this anonymous letter proved\nthat he himself knew a human being capable of the most infamous conduct,\nbut he could see no reason why that infamy should lurk in the\ndepths–which no strange eye might explore–of the warm heart rather than\nthe cold, the artist’s rather than the business-man’s, the noble’s rather\nthan the flunkey’s. What criterion ought one to adopt, in order to judge\none’s fellows? After all, there was not a single one of the people whom he\nknew who might not, in certain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful\naction. Must he then cease to see them all? His mind grew clouded; he\npassed his hands two or three times across his brow, wiped his glasses\nwith his handkerchief, and remembering that, after all, men who were as\ngood as himself frequented the society of M. de Charlus, the Prince des\nLaumes and the rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that\nthey were incapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity\nin human life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of\npeople who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. And he continued\nto shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely\nformal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to\ndrive him to despair. As for the actual contents of the letter, they did\nnot disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated against\nOdette could he see the least vestige of fact. Like many other men, Swann\nhad a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. He knew quite well\nas a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but in the case\nof any one human being he imagined all that part of his or her life with\nwhich he was not familiar as being identical with the part with which he\nwas. He imagined what was kept secret from him in the light of what was\nrevealed. At such times as he spent with Odette, if their conversation\nturned upon an indelicate act committed, or an indelicate sentiment\nexpressed by some third person, she would ruthlessly condemn the culprit\nby virtue of the same moral principles which Swann had always heard\nexpressed by his own parents, and to which he himself had remained loyal;\nand then, she would arrange her flowers, would sip her tea, would shew an\ninterest in his work. So Swann extended those habits to fill the rest of\nher life, he reconstructed those actions when he wished to form a picture\nof the moments in which he and she were apart. If anyone had portrayed her\nto him as she was, or rather as she had been for so long with himself, but\nhad substituted some other man, he would have been distressed, for such a\nportrait would have struck him as lifelike. But to suppose that she went\nto bad houses, that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that\nshe led the crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible\nof mortals–would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation\nof which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the\ndaily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor place.\nOnly, now and again, he gave Odette to understand that people maliciously\nkept him informed of everything that she did; and making opportune use of\nsome detail–insignificant but true–which he had accidentally learned, as\nthough it were the sole fragment which he would allow, in spite of\nhimself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless other fragments of that\ncomplete reconstruction of her daily life which he carried secretly in his\nmind, he led her to suppose that he was perfectly informed upon matters,\nwhich, in reality, he neither knew nor suspected, for if he often adjured\nOdette never to swerve from or make alteration of the truth, that was\nonly, whether he realised it or no, in order that Odette should tell him\neverything that she did. No doubt, as he used to assure Odette, he loved\nsincerity, but only as he might love a pander who could keep him in touch\nwith the daily life of his mistress.  Moreover, his love of sincerity, not\nbeing disinterested, had not improved his character. The truth which he\ncherished was that which Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order\nto extract that truth from her, was not afraid to have recourse to\nfalsehood, that very falsehood which he never ceased to depict to Odette\nas leading every human creature down to utter degradation. In a word, he\nlied as much as did Odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was\nno less egotistical. And she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the\nthings that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust and,\nat all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be humiliated, and\nto be blushing for her actions. One day, after the longest period of calm\nthrough which he had yet been able to exist without being overtaken by an\nattack of jealousy, he had accepted an invitation to spend the evening at\nthe theatre with the Princesse des Laumes. Having opened his newspaper to\nfind out what was being played, the sight of the title–Les Filles de\nMarbre, by Théodore Barrière,–struck him so cruel a blow that he\nrecoiled instinctively from it and turned his head away. Illuminated, as\nthough by a row of footlights, in the new surroundings in which it now\nappeared, that word ’marble,’ which he had lost the power to distinguish,\nso often had it passed, in print, beneath his eyes, had suddenly become\nvisible once again, and had at once brought back to his mind the story\nwhich Odette had told him, long ago, of a visit which she had paid to the\nSalon at the Palais d’Industrie with Mme. Verdurin, who had said to her,\n\"Take care, now! I know how to melt you, all right. You’re not made of\nmarble.” Odette had assured him that it was only a joke, and he had not\nattached any importance to it at the time. But he had had more confidence\nin her then than he had now.  And the anonymous letter referred explicitly\nto relations of that sort.  Without daring to lift his eyes to the\nnewspaper, he opened it, turned the page so as not to see again the words,\nFilles de Marbre, and began to read mechanically the news from the\nprovinces. There had been a storm in the Channel, and damage was reported\nfrom Dieppe, Cabourg, Beuzeval....  Suddenly he recoiled again in horror.",
        "The name of Beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the\nsame district, Beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen, a\nsecond name, to wit Bréauté, which he had often seen on maps, but without\never previously remarking that it was the same name as that borne by his\nfriend M. de Bréauté, whom the anonymous letter accused of having been\nOdette’s lover. After all, when it came to M. de Bréauté, there was\nnothing improbable in the charge; but so far as Mme. Verdurin was\nconcerned, it was a sheer impossibility. From the fact that Odette did\noccasionally tell a lie, it was not fair to conclude that she never, by\nany chance, told the truth, and in these bantering conversations with Mme.\nVerdurin which she herself had repeated to Swann, he could recognize those\nmeaningless and dangerous pleasantries which, in their inexperience of\nlife and ignorance of vice, women often utter (thereby certifying their\nown innocence), who–as, for instance, Odette,–would be the last people\nin the world to feel any undue affection for one another. Whereas, on the\nother hand, the indignation with which she had scattered the suspicions\nwhich she had unintentionally brought into being, for a moment, in his\nmind by her story, fitted in with everything that he knew of the tastes,\nthe temperament of his mistress. But at that moment, by an inspiration of\njealousy, analogous to the inspiration which reveals to a poet or a\nphilosopher, who has nothing, so far, but an odd pair of rhymes or a\ndetached observation, the idea or the natural law which will give power,\nmastery to his work, Swann recalled for the first time a remark which\nOdette had made to him, at least two years before: “Oh, Mme. Verdurin, she\nwon’t hear of anything just now but me. I’m a ’love,’ if you please, and\nshe kisses me, and wants me to go with her everywhere, and call her by her\nChristian name.” So far from seeing in these expressions any connection\nwith the absurd insinuations, intended to create an atmosphere of vice,\nwhich Odette had since repeated to him, he had welcomed them as a proof of\nMme. Verdurin’s warm-hearted and generous friendship. But now this old\nmemory of her affection for Odette had coalesced suddenly with his more\nrecent memory of her unseemly conversation. He could no longer separate\nthem in his mind, and he saw them blended in reality, the affection\nimparting a certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which,\nin return, spoiled the affection of its innocence. He went to see Odette.\nHe sat down, keeping at a distance from her. He did not dare to embrace\nher, not knowing whether in her, in himself, it would be affection or\nanger that a kiss would provoke. He sat there silent, watching their love\nexpire. Suddenly he made up his mind.",
        "“Odette, my darling,” he began, “I know, I am being simply odious, but I\nmust ask you a few questions. You remember what I once thought about you\nand Mme. Verdurin? Tell me, was it true? Have you, with her or anyone\nelse, ever?”",
        "She shook her head, pursing her lips together; a sign which people\ncommonly employ to signify that they are not going, because it would bore\nthem to go, when some one has asked, “Are you coming to watch the\nprocession go by?”, or “Will you be at the review?”. But this shake of the\nhead, which is thus commonly used to decline participation in an event\nthat has yet to come, imparts for that reason an element of uncertainty to\nthe denial of participation in an event that is past. Furthermore, it\nsuggests reasons of personal convenience, rather than any definite\nrepudiation, any moral impossibility. When he saw Odette thus make him a\nsign that the insinuation was false, he realised that it was quite\npossibly true.",
        "“I have told you, I never did; you know quite well,” she added, seeming\nangry and uncomfortable.",
        "“Yes, I know all that; but are you quite sure? Don’t say to me, ’You know\nquite well’; say, ’I have never done anything of that sort with any\nwoman.’”",
        "She repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote, and as though she\nhoped, thereby, to be rid of him: “I have never done anything of that sort\nwith any woman.”",
        "“Can you swear it to me on your Laghetto medal?”",
        "Swann knew that Odette would never perjure herself on that.",
        "“Oh, you do make me so miserable,” she cried, with a jerk of her body as\nthough to shake herself free of the constraint of his question. “Have you\nnearly done? What is the matter with you to-day? You seem to have made up\nyour mind that I am to be forced to hate you, to curse you! Look, I was\nanxious to be friends with you again, for us to have a nice time together,\nlike the old days; and this is all the thanks I get!”",
        "However, he would not let her go, but sat there like a surgeon who waits\nfor a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not\nmake him abandon it.",
        "“You are quite wrong in supposing that I bear you the least ill-will in\nthe world, Odette,” he began with a persuasive and deceitful gentleness.\n\"I never speak to you except of what I already know, and I always know a\ngreat deal more than I say. But you alone can mollify by your confession\nwhat makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by other\npeople. My anger with you is never due to your actions–I can and do\nforgive you everything because I love you–but to your untruthfulness, the\nridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in denying things which\nI know to be true. How can you expect that I shall continue to love you,\nwhen I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know\nto be false? Odette, do not prolong this moment which is torturing us\nboth. If you are willing to end it at once, you shall be free of it for\never.  Tell me, upon your medal, yes or no, whether you have ever done\nthose things.”",
        "“How on earth can I tell?” she was furious. “Perhaps I have, ever so long\nago, when I didn’t know what I was doing, perhaps two or three times.”",
        "Swann had prepared himself for all possibilities. Reality must, therefore,\nbe something which bears no relation to possibilities, any more than the\nstab of a knife in one’s body bears to the gradual movement of the clouds\noverhead, since those words “two or three times” carved, as it were, a\ncross upon the living tissues of his heart. A strange thing, indeed, that\nthose words, “two or three times,” nothing more than a few words, words\nuttered in the air, at a distance, could so lacerate a man’s heart, as if\nthey had actually pierced it, could sicken a man, like a poison that he\nhad drunk. Instinctively Swann thought of the remark that he had heard at\nMme. de Saint-Euverte’s: “I have never seen anything to beat it since the\ntable-turning.” The agony that he now suffered in no way resembled what he\nhad supposed. Not only because, in the hours when he most entirely\nmistrusted her, he had rarely imagined such a culmination of evil, but\nbecause, even when he did imagine that offence, it remained vague,\nuncertain, was not clothed in the particular horror which had escaped with\nthe words “perhaps two or three times,” was not armed with that specific\ncruelty, as different from anything that he had known as a new malady by\nwhich one is attacked for the first time. And yet this Odette, from whom\nall this evil sprang, was no less dear to him, was, on the contrary, more\nprecious, as if, in proportion as his sufferings increased, there\nincreased at the same time the price of the sedative, of the antidote\nwhich this woman alone possessed. He wished to pay her more attention, as\none attends to a disease which one discovers, suddenly, to have grown more\nserious. He wished that the horrible thing which, she had told him, she\nhad done “two or three times” might be prevented from occurring again. To\nensure that, he must watch over Odette. People often say that, by pointing\nout to a man the faults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening\nhis attachment to her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more\nso if he does! But, Swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect\nher? He might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of\nany one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how\ninsane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when he had\nfailed to find Odette at the Verdurins’) to desire the possession–as if\nthat were ever possible–of another person. Happily for Swann, beneath the\nmass of suffering which had invaded his soul like a conquering horde of\nbarbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older, more placid, and\nsilently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ which at once set\nto work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles of a paralysed limb\nwhich tend to recover their former movements. These older, these\nautochthonous in-dwellers in his soul absorbed all Swann’s strength, for a\nwhile, in that obscure task of reparation which gives one an illusory\nsense of repose during convalescence, or after an operation. This time it\nwas not so much–as it ordinarily was–in Swann’s brain that the\nslackening of tension due to exhaustion took effect, it was rather in his\nheart. But all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur,\nand, like a dying animal that is once more stirred by the throes of a\nconvulsion which was, apparently, ended, upon Swann’s heart, spared for a\nmoment only, the same agony returned of its own accord to trace the same\ncross again. He remembered those moonlit evenings, when, leaning back in\nthe victoria that was taking him to the Rue La Pérouse, he would cultivate\nwith voluptuous enjoyment the emotions of a man in love, ignorant of the\npoisoned fruit that such emotions must inevitably bear. But all those\nthoughts lasted for no more than a second, the time that it took him to\nraise his hand to his heart, to draw breath again and to contrive to\nsmile, so as to dissemble his torment. Already he had begun to put further\nquestions. For his jealousy, which had taken an amount of trouble, such as\nno enemy would have incurred, to strike him this mortal blow, to make him\nforcibly acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known, his\njealousy was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to\nexpose his bosom to an even deeper wound. Like an evil deity, his jealousy\nwas inspiring Swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. It was not\nhis fault, but Odette’s alone, if at first his punishment was not more\nsevere.",
        "“My darling,” he began again, “it’s all over now; was it with anyone I\nknow?”",
        "“No, I swear it wasn’t; besides, I think I exaggerated, I never really\nwent as far as that.”",
        "He smiled, and resumed with: “Just as you like. It doesn’t really matter,\nbut it’s unfortunate that you can’t give me any name. If I were able to\nform an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking of her\nagain. I say it for your own sake, because then I shouldn’t bother you any\nmore about it. It’s so soothing to be able to form a clear picture of\nthings in one’s mind. What is really terrible is what one cannot imagine.\nBut you’ve been so sweet to me; I don’t want to tire you. I do thank you,\nwith all my heart, for all the good that you have done me. I’ve quite\nfinished now.  Only one word more: how many times?”",
        "“Oh, Charles! can’t you see, you’re killing me? It’s all ever so long ago.\nI’ve never given it a thought. Anyone would say that you were positively\ntrying to put those ideas into my head again. And then you’d be a lot\nbetter off!” she concluded, with unconscious stupidity but with\nintentional malice.",
        "“I only wished to know whether it had been since I knew you. It’s only\nnatural. Did it happen here, ever? You can’t give me any particular\nevening, so that I can remind myself what I was doing at the time? You\nunderstand, surely, that it’s not possible that you don’t remember with\nwhom, Odette, my love.”",
        "“But I don’t know; really, I don’t. I think it was in the Bois, one\nevening when you came to meet us on the Island. You had been dining with\nthe Princesse des Laumes,” she added, happy to be able to furnish him with\nan exact detail, which testified to her veracity. “At the next table there\nwas a woman whom I hadn’t seen for ever so long. She said to me, ’Come\nalong round behind the rock, there, and look at the moonlight on the\nwater!’ At first I just yawned, and said, ’No, I’m too tired, and I’m\nquite happy where I am, thank you.’ She swore there’d never been anything\nlike it in the way of moonlight. ’I’ve heard that tale before,’ I said to\nher; you see, I knew quite well what she was after.” Odette narrated this\nepisode almost as if it were a joke, either because it appeared to her to\nbe quite natural, or because she thought that she was thereby minimising\nits importance, or else so as not to appear ashamed. But, catching sight\nof Swann’s face, she changed her tone, and:",
        "“You are a fiend!” she flung at him, “you enjoy tormenting me, making me\ntell you lies, just so that you’ll leave me in peace.”",
        "This second blow struck at Swann was even more excruciating than the\nfirst. Never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair, hidden\nfrom his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it, not in a past\nwhich he had never known, but in evenings which he so well remembered,\nwhich he had lived through with Odette, of which he had supposed himself\nto have such an intimate, such an exhaustive knowledge, and which now\nassumed, retrospectively, an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty. In\nthe midst of them parted, suddenly, a gaping chasm, that moment on the\nIsland in the Bois de Boulogne. Without being intelligent, Odette had the\ncharm of being natural. She had recounted, she had acted the little scene\nwith so much simplicity that Swann, as he gasped for breath, could vividly\nsee it: Odette yawning, the “rock there,”... He could hear her\nanswer–alas, how lightheartedly–\"I’ve heard that tale before!” He felt\nthat she would tell him nothing more that evening, that no further\nrevelation was to be expected for the present. He was silent for a time,\nthen said to her:",
        "“My poor darling, you must forgive me; I know, I am hurting you\ndreadfully, but it’s all over now; I shall never think of it again.”",
        "But she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not\nknow, and on that past era of their love, monotonous and soothing in his\nmemory because it was vague, and now rent, as with a sword-wound, by the\nnews of that minute on the Island in the Bois, by moonlight, while he was\ndining with the Princesse des Laumes. But he had so far acquired the habit\nof finding life interesting–of marvelling at the strange discoveries that\nthere were to be made in it–that even while he was suffering so acutely\nthat he did not believe it possible to endure such agony for any length of\ntime, he was saying to himself: “Life is indeed astonishing, and holds\nsome fine surprises; it appears that vice is far more common than one has\nbeen led to believe. Here is a woman in whom I had absolute confidence,\nwho looks so simple, so honest, who, in any case, even allowing that her\nmorals are not strict, seemed quite normal and healthy in her tastes and\ninclinations. I receive a most improbable accusation, I question her, and\nthe little that she admits reveals far more than I could ever have\nsuspected.” But he could not confine himself to these detached\nobservations.  He sought to form an exact estimate of the importance of\nwhat she had just told him, so as to know whether he might conclude that\nshe had done these things often, and was likely to do them again. He\nrepeated her words to himself: “I knew quite well what she was after.\"\n\"Two or three times.” “I’ve heard that tale before.” But they did not\nreappear in his memory unarmed; each of them held a knife with which it\nstabbed him afresh.  For a long time, like a sick man who cannot restrain\nhimself from attempting, every minute, to make the movement that, he\nknows, will hurt him, he kept on murmuring to himself: “I’m quite happy\nwhere I am, thank you,” “I’ve heard that tale before,” but the pain was so\nintense that he was obliged to stop. He was amazed to find that actions\nwhich he had always, hitherto, judged so lightly, had dismissed, indeed,\nwith a laugh, should have become as serious to him as a disease which\nmight easily prove fatal. He knew any number of women whom he could ask to\nkeep an eye on Odette, but how was he to expect them to adjust themselves\nto his new point of view, and not to remain at that which for so long had\nbeen his own, which had always guided him in his voluptuous existence; not\nto say to him with a smile: “You jealous monster, wanting to rob other\npeople of their pleasure!” By what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he\n(who had never found, in the old days, in his love for Odette, any but the\nmost refined of pleasures) been precipitated into this new circle of hell\nfrom which he could not see how he was ever to escape. Poor Odette! He\nwished her no harm. She was but half to blame. Had he not been told that\nit was her own mother who had sold her, when she was still little more\nthan a child, at Nice, to a wealthy Englishman? But what an agonising\ntruth was now contained for him in those lines of Alfred de Vigny’s\nJournal d’un Poète which he had previously read without emotion: “When\none feels oneself smitten by love for a woman, one ought to say to\noneself, ’What are ’her surroundings? What has been her life?’ All one’s\nfuture happiness lies in the answer.” Swann was astonished that such\nsimple phrases, spelt over in his mind as, “I’ve heard that tale before,\"\nor “I knew quite well what she was after,” could cause him so much pain.\nBut he realised that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed\nparts of the panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that\nhe had felt while Odette was telling her story. For it was the same\nanguish that he now was feeling afresh. It was no good, his knowing\nnow,–indeed, it was no good, as time went on, his having partly forgotten\nand altogether forgiven the offence–whenever he repeated her words his\nold anguish refashioned him as he had been before Odette began to speak:\nignorant, trustful; his merciless jealousy placed him once again, so that\nhe might be effectively wounded by Odette’s admission, in the position of\na man who does not yet know the truth; and after several months this old\nstory would still dumbfounder him, like a sudden revelation. He marvelled\nat the terrible recreative power of his memory. It was only by the\nweakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes as age\ncreeps over one, that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments. But,\nas soon as the power that any one of Odette’s sentences had to make Swann\nsuffer seemed to be nearly exhausted, lo and behold another, one of those\nto which he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a new sentence, came\nto relieve the first, and to strike at him with undiminished force. The\nmemory of the evening on which he had dined with the Princesse des Laumes\nwas painful to him, but it was no more than the centre, the core of his\npain. That radiated vaguely round about it, overflowing into all the\npreceding and following days. And on whatever point in it he might intend\nhis memory to rest, it was the whole of that season, during which the\nVerdurins had so often gone to dine upon the Island in the Bois, that\nsprang back to hurt him.  So violently, that by slow degrees the curiosity\nwhich his jealousy was ever exciting in him was neutralised by his fear of\nthe fresh tortures which he would be inflicting upon himself were he to\nsatisfy it. He recognised that all the period of Odette’s life which had\nelapsed before she first met him, a period of which he had never sought to\nform any picture in his mind, was not the featureless abstraction which he\ncould vaguely see, but had consisted of so many definite, dated years,\neach crowded with concrete incidents. But were he to learn more of them,\nhe feared lest her past, now colourless, fluid and supportable, might\nassume a tangible, an obscene form, with individual and diabolical\nfeatures. And he continued to refrain from seeking a conception of it, not\nany longer now from laziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. He hoped\nthat, some day, he might be able to hear the Island in the Bois, or the\nPrincesse des Laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old\nrending pain; meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke Odette into\nfurnishing him with fresh sentences, with the names of more places and\npeople and of different events, which, when his malady was still scarcely\nhealed, would make it break out again in another form.",
        "But, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded, now,\nto learn, it was Odette herself who, spontaneously and without thought of\nwhat she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her vices made\nbetween her actual life and the comparatively innocent life which Swann\nhad believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead, was far wider\nthan she knew. A vicious person, always affecting the same air of virtue\nbefore people whom he is anxious to keep from having any suspicion of his\nvices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which he may ascertain bow\nfar those vices (their continuous growth being imperceptible by himself)\nhave gradually segregated him from the normal ways of life. In the course\nof their cohabitation, in Odette’s mind, with the memory of those of her\nactions which she concealed from Swann, her other, her innocuous actions\nwere gradually coloured, infected by these, without her being able to\ndetect anything strange in them, without their causing any explosion in\nthe particular region of herself in which she made them live, but when she\nrelated them to Swann, he was overwhelmed by the revelation of the\nduplicity to which they pointed. One day, he was trying–without hurting\nOdette–to discover from her whether she had ever had any dealings with\nprocuresses. He was, as a matter of fact, convinced that she had not; the\nanonymous letter had put the idea into his mind, but in a purely\nmechanical way; it had been received there with no credulity, but it had,\nfor all that, remained there, and Swann, wishing to be rid of the\nburden–a dead weight, but none the less disturbing–of this suspicion,\nhoped that Odette would now extirpate it for ever.",
        "“Oh dear, no! Not that they don’t simply persecute me to go to them,” her\nsmile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it was\nimpossible should appear legitimate to Swann. “There was one of them\nwaited more than two hours for me yesterday, said she would give me any\nmoney I asked. It seems, there’s an Ambassador who said to her, ’I’ll kill\nmyself if you don’t bring her to me’–meaning me! They told her I’d gone\nout, but she waited and waited, and in the end I had to go myself and\nspeak to her, before she’d go away. I do wish you could have seen the way\nI tackled her; my maid was in the next room, listening, and told me I\nshouted fit to bring the house down:–’But when you hear me say that I\ndon’t want to! The idea of such a thing, I don’t like it at all! I should\nhope I’m still free to do as I please and when I please and where I\nplease! If I needed the money, I could understand...’ The porter has\norders not to let her in again; he will tell her that I am out of town.\nOh, I do wish I could have had you hidden somewhere in the room while I\nwas talking to her.  I know, you’d have been pleased, my dear. There’s\nsome good in your little Odette, you see, after all, though people do say\nsuch dreadful things about her.”",
        "Besides, her very admissions–when she made any–of faults which she\nsupposed him to have discovered, rather served Swann as a starting-point\nfor fresh doubts than they put an end to the old. For her admissions never\nexactly coincided with his doubts. In vain might Odette expurgate her\nconfession of all its essential part, there would remain in the\naccessories something which Swann had never yet imagined, which crushed\nhim anew, and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his\njealousy.  And these admissions he could never forget. His spirit carried\nthem along, cast them aside, then cradled them again in its bosom, like\ncorpses in a river. And they poisoned it.",
        "She spoke to him once of a visit that Forcheville had paid her on the day\nof the Paris-Murcie Fête. “What! you knew him as long ago as that?  Oh,\nyes, of course you did,” he corrected himself, so as not to shew that he\nhad been ignorant of the fact. And suddenly he began to tremble at the\nthought that, on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête, when he had received\nthat letter which he had so carefully preserved, she had been having\nluncheon, perhaps, with Forcheville at the Maison d’Or. She swore that she\nhad not. “Still, the Maison d’Or reminds me of something or other which, I\nknew at the time, wasn’t true,” he pursued, hoping to frighten her. “Yes\nthat I hadn’t been there at all that evening when I told you I had just\ncome from there, and you had been looking for me at Prévost’s,” she\nreplied (judging by his manner that he knew) with a firmness that was\nbased not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity, a fear of crossing\nSwann, which her own self-respect made her anxious to conceal, and a\ndesire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if she chose. And so\nshe struck him with all the sharpness and force of a headsman wielding his\naxe, and yet could not be charged with cruelty, since she was quite\nunconscious of hurting him; she even began to laugh, though this may\nperhaps, it is true, have been chiefly to keep him from thinking that she\nwas ashamed, at all, or confused. “It’s quite true, I hadn’t been to the\nMaison Dorée. I was coming away from Forcheville’s. I had, really, been to\nPrévost’s–that wasn’t a story–and he met me there and asked me to come\nin and look at his prints. But some one else came to see him. I told you\nthat I was coming from the Maison d’Or because I was afraid you might be\nangry with me. It was rather nice of me, really, don’t you see? I admit, I\ndid wrong, but at least I’m telling you all about it now, a’n’t I? What\nhave I to gain by not telling you, straight, that I lunched with him on\nthe day of the Paris-Murcie Fête, if it were true? Especially as at that\ntime we didn’t know one another quite so well as we do now, did we, dear?”",
        "He smiled back at her with the sudden, craven weakness of the utterly\nspiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him. And so,\neven in the months of which he had never dared to think again, because\nthey had been too happy, in those months when she had loved him, she was\nalready lying to him! Besides that moment (that first evening on which\nthey had “done a cattleya”) when she had told him that she was coming from\nthe Maison Dorée, how many others must there have been, each of them\ncovering a falsehood of which Swann had had no suspicion.  He recalled how\nshe had said to him once: “I need only tell Mme. Verdurin that my dress\nwasn’t ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.” From\nhimself too, probably, many times when she had glibly uttered such words\nas explain a delay or justify an alteration of the hour fixed for a\nmeeting, those moments must have hidden, without his having the least\ninkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had had with some other\nman, some man to whom she had said: “I need only tell Swann that my dress\nwasn’t ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.” And\nbeneath all his most pleasant memories, beneath the simplest words that\nOdette had ever spoken to him in those old days, words which he had\nbelieved as though they were the words of a Gospel, beneath her daily\nactions which she had recounted to him, beneath the most ordinary places,\nher dressmaker’s flat, the Avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he could feel\n(dissembled there, by virtue of that temporal superfluity which, after the\nmost detailed account of how a day has been spent, always leaves something\nover, that may serve as a hiding place for certain unconfessed actions),\nhe could feel the insinuation of a possible undercurrent of falsehood\nwhich debased for him all that had remained most precious, his happiest\nevenings, the Rue La Pérouse itself, which Odette must constantly have\nbeen leaving at other hours than those of which she told him; extending\nthe power of the dark horror that had gripped him when he had heard her\nadmission with regard to the Maison Dorée, and, like the obscene creatures\nin the ’Desolation of Nineveh,’ shattering, stone by stone, the whole\nedifice of his past.... If, now, he turned aside whenever his memory\nrepeated the cruel name of the Maison Dorée it was because that name\nrecalled to him, no longer, as, such a little time since, at Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte’s party, the good fortune which he long had lost, but a\nmisfortune of which he was now first aware. Then it befell the Maison\nDorée, as it had befallen the Island in the Bois, that gradually its name\nceased to trouble him. For what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy\nare, neither of them, single, continuous and individual passions. They are\ncomposed of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each\nof which is ephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give\nus the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity.  The life of\nSwann’s love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of\ninfidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which had\nOdette for their object. If he had remained for any length of time without\nseeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by others. But\nthe presence of Odette continued to sow in Swann’s heart alternate seeds\nof love and suspicion.",
        "On certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of\nwhich she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage,\nunder penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; he must\ninstantly accompany her home, to “do a cattleya,” and the desire which she\npretended to have for him was so sudden, so inexplicable, so imperious,\nthe kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative and so\nunfamiliar, that this brutal and unnatural fondness made Swann just as\nunhappy as any lie or unkind action. One evening when he had thus, in\nobedience to her command, gone home with her, and while she was\ninterspersing her kisses with passionate words, in strange contrast to her\nhabitual coldness, he thought suddenly that he heard a sound; he rose,\nsearched everywhere and found nobody, but he had not the courage to return\nto his place by her side; whereupon she, in a towering rage, broke a vase,\nwith “I never can do anything right with you, you impossible person!” And\nhe was left uncertain whether she had not actually had some man concealed\nin the room, whose jealousy she had wished to wound, or else to inflame\nhis senses.",
        "Sometimes he repaired to ’gay’ houses, hoping to learn something about\nOdette, although he dared not mention her name. “I have a little thing\nhere, you’re sure to like,” the ’manageress’ would greet him, and he would\nstay for an hour or so, talking dolefully to some poor girl who sat there\nastonished that he went no further. One of them, who was still quite young\nand attractive, said to him once, “Of course, what I should like would be\nto find a real friend, then he might be quite certain, I should never go\nwith any other men again.” “Indeed, do you think it possible for a woman\nreally to be touched by a man’s being in love with her, and never to be\nunfaithful to him?” asked Swann anxiously. “Why, surely! It all depends on\ntheir characters!” Swann could not help making the same remarks to these\ngirls as would have delighted the Princesse des Laumes. To the one who was\nin search of a friend he said, with a smile: “But how nice of you, you’ve\nput on blue eyes, to go with your sash.” “And you too, you’ve got blue\ncuffs on.” “What a charming conversation we are having, for a place of\nthis sort! I’m not boring you, am I; or keeping you?” “No, I’ve nothing to\ndo, thank you. If you bored me I should say so. But I love hearing you\ntalk.” “I am highly flattered.... Aren’t we behaving prettily?” he asked\nthe ’manageress,’ who had just looked in. “Why, yes, that’s just what I\nwas saying to myself, how sensibly they’re behaving! But that’s how it is!\nPeople come to my house now, just to talk. The Prince was telling me, only\nthe other day, that he’s far more comfortable here than with his wife.  It\nseems that, nowadays, all the society ladies are like that; a perfect\nscandal, I call it. But I’ll leave you in peace now, I know when I’m not\nwanted,” she ended discreetly, and left Swann with the girl who had the\nblue eyes. But presently he rose and said good-bye to her. She had ceased\nto interest him. She did not know Odette.",
        "The painter having been ill, Dr. Cottard recommended a sea-voyage; several\nof the ’faithful’ spoke of accompanying him; the Verdurins could not face\nthe prospect of being left alone in Paris, so first of all hired, and\nfinally purchased a yacht; thus Odette was constantly going on a cruise.\nWhenever she had been away for any length of time, Swann would feel that\nhe was beginning to detach himself from her, but, as though this moral\ndistance were proportionate to the physical distance between them,\nwhenever he heard that Odette had returned to Paris, he could not rest\nwithout seeing her. Once, when they had gone away, as everyone thought,\nfor a month only, either they succumbed to a series of temptations, or\nelse M.  Verdurin had cunningly arranged everything beforehand, to please\nhis wife, and disclosed his plans to the ’faithful’ only as time went on;\nanyhow, from Algiers they flitted to Tunis; then to Italy, Greece,\nConstantinople, Asia Minor. They had been absent for nearly a year, and\nSwann felt perfectly at ease and almost happy. Albeit M. Verdurin had\nendeavoured to persuade the pianist and Dr. Cottard that their respective\naunt and patients had no need of them, and that, in any event, it was most\nrash to allow Mme. Cottard to return to Paris, where, Mme. Verdurin\nassured him, a revolution had just broken out, he was obliged to grant\nthem their liberty at Constantinople. And the painter came home with them.\nOne day, shortly after the return of these four travellers, Swann, seeing\nan omnibus approach him, labelled ’Luxembourg,’ and having some business\nthere, had jumped on to it and had found himself sitting opposite Mme.\nCottard, who was paying a round of visits to people whose ’day’ it was, in\nfull review order, with a plume in her hat, a silk dress, a muff, an\numbrella (which do for a parasol if the rain kept off), a card-case, and a\npair of white gloves fresh from the cleaners. Wearing these badges of\nrank, she would, in fine weather, go on foot from one house to another in\nthe same neighbourhood, but when she had to proceed to another district,\nwould make use of a transfer-ticket on the omnibus. For the first minute\nor two, until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched\nsurface of the doctor’s-wife, not being certain, either, whether she ought\nto mention the Verdurins before Swann, she produced, quite naturally, in\nher slow and awkward, but not unattractive voice, which, every now and\nthen, was completely drowned by the rattling of the omnibus, topics\nselected from those which she had picked up and would repeat in each of\nthe score of houses up the stairs of which she clambered in the course of\nan afternoon.",
        "“I needn’t ask you, M. Swann, whether a man so much in the movement as\nyourself has been to the Mirlitons, to see the portrait by Machard that\nthe whole of Paris is running after. Well, and what do you think of it?\nWhose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse? It’s the same\nin every house in Paris now, no one will speak of anything else but\nMachard’s portrait; you aren’t smart, you aren’t really cultured, you\naren’t up-to-date unless you give an opinion on Machard’s portrait.”",
        "Swann having replied that he had not seen this portrait, Mme. Cottard was\nafraid that she might have hurt his feelings by obliging him to confess\nthe omission.",
        "“Oh, that’s quite all right! At least you have the courage to be quite\nfrank about it. You don’t consider yourself disgraced because you haven’t\nseen Machard’s portrait. I do think that so nice of you. Well now, I have\nseen it; opinion is divided, you know, there are some people who find it\nrather laboured, like whipped cream, they say; but I think it’s just\nideal.  Of course, she’s not a bit like the blue and yellow ladies that\nour friend Biche paints. That’s quite clear. But I must tell you,\nperfectly frankly (you’ll think me dreadfully old-fashioned, but I always\nsay just what I think), that I don’t understand his work. I can quite see\nthe good points there are in his portrait of my husband; oh, dear me, yes;\nand it’s certainly less odd than most of what he does, but even then he\nhad to give the poor man a blue moustache! But Machard! Just listen to\nthis now, the husband of my friend, I am on my way to see at this very\nmoment (which has given me the very great pleasure of your company), has\npromised her that, if he is elected to the Academy (he is one of the\nDoctor’s colleagues), he will get Machard to paint her portrait. So she’s\ngot something to look forward to! I have another friend who insists that\nshe’d rather have Leloir.  I’m only a wretched Philistine, and I’ve no\ndoubt Leloir has perhaps more knowledge of painting even than Machard. But\nI do think that the most important thing about a portrait, especially when\nit’s going to cost ten thousand francs, is that it should be like, and a\npleasant likeness, if you know what I mean.”",
        "Having exhausted this topic, to which she had been inspired by the\nloftiness of her plume, the monogram on her card-case, the little number\ninked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner, and the difficulty of\nspeaking to Swann about the Verdurins, Mme. Cottard, seeing that they had\nstill a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the Rue\nBonaparte, where the conductor was to set her down, listened to the\npromptings of her heart, which counselled other words than these.",
        "“Your ears must have been burning,” she ventured, “while we were on the\nyacht with Mme. Verdurin. We were talking about you all the time.”",
        "Swann was genuinely astonished, for he supposed that his name was never\nuttered in the Verdurins’ presence.",
        "“You see,” Mme. Cottard went on, “Mme. de Crécy was there; need I say\nmore? When Odette is anywhere it’s never long before she begins talking\nabout you. And you know quite well, it isn’t nasty things she says.  What!\nyou don’t believe me!” she went on, noticing that Svrann looked sceptical.\nAnd, carried away by the sincerity of her conviction, without putting any\nevil meaning into the word, which she used purely in the sense in which\none employs it to speak of the affection that unites a pair of friends:\n\"Why, she adores you! No, indeed; I’m sure it would never do to say\nanything against you when she was about; one would soon be taught one’s\nplace! Whatever we might be doing, if we were looking at a picture, for\ninstance, she would say, ’If only we had him here, he’s the man who could\ntell us whether it’s genuine or not. There’s no one like him for that.’\nAnd all day long she would be saying, ’What can he be doing just now?  I\ndo hope, he’s doing a little work! It’s too dreadful that a fellow with\nsuch gifts as he has should be so lazy.’ (Forgive me, won’t you.) ’I can\nsee him this very moment; he’s thinking of us, he’s wondering where we\nare.’ Indeed, she used an expression which I thought very pretty at the\ntime.  M. Verdurin asked her, ’How in the world can you see what he’s\ndoing, when he’s a thousand miles away?’ And Odette answered, ’Nothing is\nimpossible to the eye of a friend.’",
        "“No, I assure you, I’m not saying it just to flatter you; you have a true\nfriend in her, such as one doesn’t often find. I can tell you, besides, in\ncase you don’t know it, that you’re the only one. Mme. Verdurin told me as\nmuch herself on our last day with them (one talks more freely, don’t you\nknow, before a parting), ’I don’t say that Odette isn’t fond of us, but\nanything that we may say to her counts for very little beside what Swann\nmight say.’ Oh, mercy, there’s the conductor stopping for me; here have I\nbeen chatting away to you, and would have gone right past the Rue\nBonaparte, and never noticed... Will you be so very kind as to tell me\nwhether my plume is straight?”",
        "And Mme. Cottard withdrew from her muff, to offer it to Swann, a\nwhite-gloved hand from which there floated, with a transier-ticket, an\natmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with the\nharsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. And Swann felt himself overflowing\nwith gratitude to her, as well as to Mme. Verdurin (and almost to Odette,\nfor the feeling that he now entertained for her was no longer tinged with\npain, was scarcely even to be described, now, as love), while from the\nplatform of the omnibus he followed her with loving eyes, as she gallantly\nthreaded her way along the Rue Bonaparte, her plume erect, her skirt held\nup in one hand, while in the other she clasped her umbrella and her\ncard-case, so that its monogram could be seen, her muff dancing in the air\nbefore her as she went.",
        "To compete with and so to stimulate the moribund feelings that Swann had\nfor Odette, Mme. Cottard, a wiser physician, in this case, than ever her\nhusband would have been, had grafted among them others more normal,\nfeelings of gratitude, of friendship, which in Swann’s mind were to make\nOdette seem again more human (more like other women, since other women\ncould inspire the same feelings in him), were to hasten her final\ntransformation back into that Odette, loved with an undisturbed affection,\nwho had taken him home one evening after a revel at the painter’s, to\ndrink orangeade with Forcheville, that Odette with whom Swann had\ncalculated that he might live in happiness.",
        "In former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come\nwhen he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had determined to keep a\nsharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to escape\nhim, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. But now, to the faintness\nof his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in his desire to\nremain her lover. For a man cannot change, that is to say become another\nperson, while he continues to obey the dictates of the self which he has\nceased to be. Occasionally the name, if it caught his eye in a newspaper,\nof one of the men whom he supposed to have been Odette’s lovers,\nreawakened his jealousy. But it was very slight, and, inasmuch as it\nproved to him that he had not completely emerged from that period in which\nhe had so keenly suffered–though in it he had also known a way of feeling\nso intensely happy–and that the accidents of his course might still\nenable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily and at a distance,\nof its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything, an agreeable thrill,\nas to the sad Parisian, when he has left Venice behind him and must return\nto France, a last mosquito proves that Italy and summer are still not too\nremote. But, as a rule, with this particular period of his life from which\nhe was emerging, when he made an effort, if not to remain in it, at least\nto obtain, while still he might, an uninterrupted view of it, he\ndiscovered that already it was too late; he would have looked back to\ndistinguish, as it might be a landscape that was about to disappear, that\nlove from which he had departed, but it is so difficult to enter into a\nstate of complete duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle\nof a feeling which one has ceased to possess, that very soon, the clouds\ngathering in his brain, he could see nothing, he would abandon the\nattempt, would take the glasses from his nose and wipe them; and he told\nhimself that he would do better to rest for a little, that there would be\ntime enough later on, and settled back into his corner with as little\ncuriosity, with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap\ndown over his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway-carriage that is\ndrawing him, he feels, faster and faster, out of the country in which he\nhas lived for so long, and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip\naway from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. Indeed, like\nthe same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the frontier\nand is again in France, when Swann happened to alight, close at hand, upon\nsomething which proved that Forcheville had been Odette’s lover, he\ndiscovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now utterly remote,\nand he regretted that he had had no warning of the moment in which he had\nemerged from it for ever. And just as, before kissing Odette for the first\ntime, he had sought to imprint upon his memory the face that for so long\nhad been familiar, before it was altered by the additional memory of their\nkiss, so he could have wished–in thought at least–to have been in a\nposition to bid farewell, while she still existed, to that Odette who had\ninspired love in him and jealousy, to that Odette who had caused him so to\nsuffer, and whom now he would never see again.  He was mistaken. He was\ndestined to see her once again, a few weeks later.  It was while he was\nasleep, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr.\nCottard, a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter,\nOdette, Napoleon III and my grandfather, along a path which followed the\nline of the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a\nfew feet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of\nthe party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to\nthose who were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was\nfailing, and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on\nthem. Now and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and Swann could\nfeel on his cheek a shower of freezing spray. Odette told him to wipe this\noff, but he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as\nwell as because he was in his nightshirt. He hoped that, in the darkness,\nthis might pass unnoticed; Mme. Verdurin, however, fixed her astonished\ngaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change its\nshape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy\nmoustache. He turned away to examine Odette; her cheeks were pale, with\nlittle fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she\nlooked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach\nthemselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he loved\nher so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him at once.\nSuddenly Odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch, and said: “I\nmust go.” She took leave of everyone, in the same formal manner, without\ntaking Swann aside, without telling him where they were to meet that\nevening, or next day. He dared not ask, he would have liked to follow her,\nhe was obliged, without turning back in her direction, to answer with a\nsmile some question by Mme. Verdurin; but his heart was frantically\nbeating, he felt that he now hated Odette, he would gladly have crushed\nthose eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly, have torn the\nblood into those lifeless cheeks. He continued to climb with Mme.\nVerdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from Odette, who\nwas going downhill, and in the other direction. A second passed and it was\nmany hours since she had left him. The painter remarked to Swann that\nNapoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. “They had\nobviously arranged it between them,” he added; “they must have agreed to\nmeet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn’t say good-bye together; it\nmight have looked odd. She is his mistress.” The strange young man burst\ninto tears. Swann endeavoured to console him. “After all, she is quite\nright,” he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off\nthe fez to make him feel more at ease. “I’ve advised her to do that,\nmyself, a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to\nunderstand her.” So Swann reasoned with himself, for the young man whom he\nhad failed, at first, to identify, was himself also; like certain\nnovelists, he had distributed his own personality between two characters,\nhim who was the ’first person’ in the dream, and another whom he saw\nbefore him, capped with a fez.",
        "As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association of\nideas, then a certain modification of the Baron’s usual physiognomy, and\nlastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his breast, had\nmade Swann give that name; but actually, and in everything that the person\nwho appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him, it was indeed\nForcheville. For, from an incomplete and changing set of images, Swann in\nhis sleep drew false deductions, enjoying, at the same time, such creative\npower that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple act of division,\nlike certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he felt in his own palm\nhe modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought that he was\nclasping, and out of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet\nconscious, he brought about sudden vicissitudes which, by a chain of\nlogical sequences, would produce, at definite points in his dream, the\nperson required to receive his love or to startle him awake. In an instant\nnight grew black about him; an alarum rang, the inhabitants ran past him,\nescaping from their blazing houses; he could hear the thunder of the\nsurging waves, and also of his own heart, which, with equal violence, was\nanxiously beating in his breast. Suddenly the speed of these palpitations\nredoubled, he felt a pain, a nausea that were inexplicable; a peasant,\ndreadfully burned, flung at him as he passed: “Come and ask Charlus where\nOdette spent the night with her friend. He used to go about with her, and\nshe tells him everything. It was they that started the fire.” It was his\nvalet, come to awaken him, and saying:–-",
        "“Sir, it is eight o’clock, and the barber is here. I have told him to call\nagain in an hour.”",
        "But these words, as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which\nSwann was submerged, did not reach his consciousness without undergoing\nthat refraction which turns a ray of light, at the bottom of a bowl of\nwater, into another sun; just as, a moment earlier, the sound of the\ndoor-bell, swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the clangour\nof an alarum, had engendered the episode of the fire. Meanwhile the\nscenery of his dream-stage scattered in dust, he opened his eyes, heard\nfor the last time the boom of a wave in the sea, grown very distant. He\ntouched his cheek. It was dry. And yet he could feel the sting of the cold\nspray, and the taste of salt on his lips. He rose, and dressed himself. He\nhad made the barber come early because he had written, the day before, to\nmy grandfather, to say that he was going, that afternoon, to Combray,\nhaving learned that Mme. de Cambremer–Mlle. Legrandin that had been–was\nspending a few days there. The association in his memory of her young and\ncharming face with a place in the country which he had not visited for so\nlong, offered him a combined attraction which had made him decide at last\nto leave Paris for a while. As the different changes and chances that\nbring us into the company of certain other people in this life do not\ncoincide with the periods in which we are in love with those people, but,\noverlapping them, may occur before love has begun, and may be repeated\nafter love is ended, the earliest appearances, in our life, of a creature\nwho is destined to afford us pleasure later on, assume retrospectively in\nour eyes a certain value as an indication, a warning, a presage. It was in\nthis fashion that Swann had often carried back his mind to the image of\nOdette, encountered in the theatre, on that first evening when he had no\nthought of ever seeing her again–and that he now recalled the party at\nMme. de Saint-Euverte’s, at which he had introduced General de\nFrober-ville to Mme. de Cambremer. So manifold are our interests in life\nthat it is not uncommon that, on a single occasion, the foundations of a\nhappiness which does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with\naggravations of a grief from which we are still suffering. And, no doubt,\nthat might have occurred to Swann elsewhere than at Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte’s. Who, indeed, can say whether, in the event of his having\ngone, that evening, somewhere else, other happinesses, other griefs would\nnot have come to him, which, later, would have appeared to have been\ninevitable? But what did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had\nindeed taken place, and he was not far short of seeing something\nprovidential in the fact that he had at last decided to go to Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte’s that evening, because his mind, anxious to admire the\nrichness of invention that life shews, and incapable of facing a difficult\nproblem for any length of time, such as to discover what, actually, had\nbeen most to be wished for, came to the conclusion that the sufferings\nthrough which he had passed that evening, and the pleasures, at that time\nunsuspected, which were already being brought to birth,–the exact balance\nbetween which was too difficult to establish–were linked by a sort of\nconcatenation of necessity.",
        "But while, an hour after his awakening, he was giving instructions to the\nbarber, so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become disarranged on\nthe journey, he thought once again of his dream; he saw once again, as he\nhad felt them close beside him, Odette’s pallid complexion, her too thin\ncheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, all the things which–in the\ncourse of those successive bursts of affection which had made of his\nenduring love for Odette a long oblivion of the first impression that he\nhad formed of her–he had ceased to observe after the first few days of\ntheir intimacy, days to which, doubtless, while he slept, his memory had\nreturned to seek the exact sensation of those things. And with that old,\nintermittent fatuity, which reappeared in him now that he was no longer\nunhappy, and lowered, at the same time, the average level of his morality,\nhe cried out in his heart: “To think that I have wasted years of my life,\nthat I have longed for death, that the greatest love that I have ever\nknown has been for a woman who did not please me, who was not in my\nstyle!”",
        "Among the rooms which used most commonly to take shape in my mind during\nmy long nights of sleeplessness, there was none that differed more utterly\nfrom the rooms at Combray, thickly powdered with the motes of an\natmosphere granular, pollenous, edible and instinct with piety, than my\nroom in the Grand Hôtel de la Plage, at Balbec, the walls of which, washed\nwith ripolin, contained, like the polished sides of a basin in which the\nwater glows with a blue, lurking fire, a finer air, pure, azure-tinted,\nsaline.  The Bavarian upholsterer who had been entrusted with the\nfurnishing of this hotel had varied his scheme of decoration in different\nrooms, and in that which I found myself occupying had set against the\nwalls, on three sides of it, a series of low book-cases with glass fronts,\nin which, according to where they stood, by a law of nature which he had,\nperhaps, forgotten to take into account, was reflected this or that\nsection of the ever-changing view of the sea, so that the walls were lined\nwith a frieze of seascapes, interrupted only by the polished mahogany of\nthe actual shelves. And so effective was this that the whole room had the\nappearance of one of those model bedrooms which you see nowadays in\nHousing Exhibitions, decorated with works of art which are calculated by\ntheir designer to refresh the eyes of whoever may ultimately have to sleep\nin the rooms, the subjects being kept in some degree of harmony with the\nlocality and surroundings of the houses for which the rooms are planned.",
        "And yet nothing could have differed more utterly, either, from the real\nBalbec than that other Balbec of which I had often dreamed, on stormy\ndays, when the wind was so strong that Françoise, as she took me to the\nChamps-Elysées, would warn me not to walk too near the side of the street,\nor I might have my head knocked off by a falling slate, and would recount\nto me, with many lamentations, the terrible disasters and shipwrecks that\nwere reported in the newspaper. I longed for nothing more than to behold a\nstorm at sea, less as a mighty spectacle than as a momentary revelation of\nthe true life of nature; or rather there were for me no mighty spectacles\nsave those which I knew to be not artificially composed for my\nentertainment, but necessary and unalterable,–the beauty of landscapes or\nof great works of art. I was not curious, I did not thirst to know\nanything save what I believed to be more genuine than myself, what had for\nme the supreme merit of shewing me a fragment of the mind of a great\ngenius, or of the force or the grace of nature as she appeared when left\nentirely to herself, without human interference. Just as the lovely sound\nof her voice, reproduced, all by itself, upon the phonograph, could never\nconsole a man for the loss of his mother, so a mechanical imitation of a\nstorm would have left me as cold as did the illuminated fountains at the\nExhibition. I required also, if the storm was to be absolutely genuine,\nthat the shore from which I watched it should be a natural shore, not an\nembankment recently constructed by a municipality. Besides, nature, by all\nthe feelings that she aroused in me, seemed to me the most opposite thing\nin the world to the mechanical inventions of mankind The less she bore\ntheir imprint, the more room she offered for the expansion of my heart.\nAnd, as it happened, I had preserved the name of Balbec, which Legrandin\nhad cited to us, as that of a sea-side place in the very midst of “that\nfunereal coast, famed for the number of its wrecks, swathed, for six\nmonths in the year, in a shroud of fog and flying foam from the waves.",
        "“You feel, there, below your feet still,” he had told me, “far more even\nthan at Finistère (and even though hotels are now being superimposed upon\nit, without power, however, to modify that oldest bone in the earth’s\nskeleton) you feel there that you are actually at the land’s end of\nFrance, of Europe, of the Old World. And it is the ultimate encampment of\nthe fishermen, precisely like the fishermen who have lived since the\nworld’s beginning, facing the everlasting kingdom of the sea-fogs and\nshadows of the night.” One day when, at Combray, I had spoken of this\ncoast, this Balbec, before M. Swann, hoping to learn from him whether it\nwas the best point to select for seeing the most violent storms, he had\nreplied: “I should think I did know Balbec! The church at Balbec, built in\nthe twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and still half romanesque, is\nperhaps the most curious example to be found of our Norman gothic, and so\nexceptional that one is tempted to describe it as Persian in its\ninspiration.” And that region, which, until then, had seemed to me to be\nnothing else than a part of immemorial nature, that had remained\ncontemporaneous with the great phenomena of geology–and as remote from\nhuman history as the Ocean itself, or the Great Bear, with its wild race\nof fishermen for whom, no more than for their whales, had there been any\nMiddle Ages–it had been a great joy to me to see it suddenly take its\nplace in the order of the centuries, with a stored consciousness of the\nromanesque epoch, and to know that the gothic trefoil had come to\ndiversify those wild rocks also, at the appointed hour, like those frail\nbut hardy plants which, in the Polar regions, when the spring returns,\nscatter their stars about the eternal snows. And if gothic art brought to\nthose places and people a classification which, otherwise, they lacked,\nthey too conferred one upon it in return. I tried to form a picture in my\nmind of how those fishermen had lived, the timid and unsuspected essay\ntowards social intercourse which they had attempted there, clustered upon\na promontory of the shores of Hell, at the foot of the cliffs of death;\nand gothic art seemed to me a more living thing now that, detaching it\nfrom the towns in which, until then, I had always imagined it, I could see\nhow, in a particular instance, upon a reef of savage rocks, it had taken\nroot and grown until it flowered in a tapering spire. I was taken to see\nreproductions of the most famous of the statues at Balbec,–shaggy,\nblunt-faced Apostles, the Virgin from the porch,–and I could scarcely\nbreathe for joy at the thought that I might myself, one day, see them take\na solid form against their eternal background of salt fog. Thereafter, on\ndear, tempestuous February nights, the wind–- breathing into my heart,\nwhich it shook no less violently than the chimney of my bedroom, the\nproject of a visit to Balbec–blended in me the desire for gothic\narchitecture with that for a storm upon the sea.",
        "I should have liked to take, the very next day, the good, the generous\ntrain at one twenty-two, of which never without a palpitating heart could\nI read, in the railway company’s bills or in advertisements of circular\ntours, the hour of departure: it seemed to me to cut, at a precise point\nin every afternoon, a most fascinating groove, a mysterious mark, from\nwhich the diverted hours still led one on, of course, towards evening,\ntowards to-morrow morning, but to an evening and morning which one would\nbehold, not in Paris but in one of those towns through which the train\npassed and among which it allowed one to choose; for it stopped at Bayeux,\nat Coutances, at Vitré, at Questambert, at Pontorson, at Balbec, at\nLannion, at Lamballe, at Benodet, at Pont-Aven, at Quimperle, and\nprogressed magnificently surcharged with names which it offered me, so\nthat, among them all, I did not know which to choose, so impossible was it\nto sacrifice any. But even without waiting for the train next day, I\ncould, by rising and dressing myself with all speed, leave Paris that very\nevening, should my parents permit, and arrive at Balbec as dawn spread\nwestward over the raging sea, from whose driven foam I would seek shelter\nin that church in the Persian manner. But at the approach of the Easter\nholidays, when my parents bad promised to let me spend them, for once, in\nthe North of Italy, lo! in place of those dreams of tempests, by which I\nhad been entirely possessed, not wishing to see anything but waves dashing\nin from all sides, mounting always higher, upon the wildest of coasts,\nbeside churches as rugged and precipitous as cliffs, in whose towers the\nsea-birds would be wailing; suddenly, effacing them, taking away all their\ncharm, excluding them because they were its opposite and could only have\nweakened its effect, was substituted in me the converse dream of the most\nvariegated of springs, not the spring of Combray, still pricking with all\nthe needle-points of the winter’s frost, but that which already covered\nwith lilies and anemones the meadows of Fiesole, and gave Florence a\ndazzling golden background, like those in Fra Angelico’s pictures. From\nthat moment, only sunlight, perfumes, colours, seemed to me to have any\nvalue; for this alternation of images had effected a change of front in my\ndesire, and–as abrupt as those that occur sometimes in music,–a complete\nchange of tone in my sensibility. Thus it came about that a mere\natmospheric variation would be sufficient to provoke in me that\nmodulation, without there being any need for me to await the return of a\nseason. For often we find a day, in one, that has strayed from another\nseason, and makes us live in that other, summons at once into our presence\nand makes us long for its peculiar pleasures, and interrupts the dreams\nthat we were in process of weaving, by inserting, out of its turn, too\nearly or too late, this leaf, torn from another chapter, in the\ninterpolated calendar of Happiness. But soon it happened that, like those\nnatural phenomena from which our comfort or our health can derive but an\naccidental and all too modest benefit, until the day when science takes\ncontrol of them, and, producing them at will, places in our hands the\npower to order their appearance, withdrawn from the tutelage and\nindependent of the consent of chance; similarly the production of these\ndreams of the Atlantic and of Italy ceased to depend entirely upon the\nchanges of the seasons and of the weather. I need only, to make them\nreappear, pronounce the names: Balbec, Venice, Florence, within whose\nsyllables had gradually accumulated all the longing inspired in me by the\nplaces for which they stood. Even in spring, to come in a book upon the\nname of Balbec sufficed to awaken in me the desire for storms at sea and\nfor the Norman gothic; even on a stormy day the name of Florence or of\nVenice would awaken the desire for sunshine, for lilies, for the Palace of\nthe Doges and for Santa Maria del Fiore.",
        "But if their names thus permanently absorbed the image that I had formed\nof these towns, it was only by transforming that image, by subordinating\nits reappearance in me to their own special laws; and in consequence of\nthis they made it more beautiful, but at the same time more different from\nanything that the towns of Normandy or Tuscany could in reality be, and,\nby increasing the arbitrary delights of my imagination, aggravated the\ndisenchantment that was in store for me when I set out upon my travels.\nThey magnified the idea that I formed of certain points on the earth’s\nsurface, making them more special, and in consequence more real. I did not\nthen represent to myself towns, landscapes, historic buildings, as\npictures more or less attractive, cut out here and there of a substance\nthat was common to them all, but looked on each of them as on an unknown\nthing, different from all the rest, a thing for which my soul was athirst,\nby the knowledge of which it would benefit. How much more individual still\nwas the character that they assumed from being designated by names, names\nthat were only for themselves, proper names such as people have. Words\npresent to us little pictures of things, lucid and normal, like the\npictures that are hung on the walls of schoolrooms to give children an\nillustration of what is meant by a carpenter’s bench, a bird, an ant-hill;\nthings chosen as typical of everything else of the same sort. But names\npresent to us–of persons and of towns which they accustom us to regard as\nindividual, as unique, like persons–a confused picture, which draws from\nthe names, from the brightness or darkness of their sound, the colour in\nwhich it is uniformly painted, like one of those posters, entirely blue or\nentirely red, in which, on account of the limitations imposed by the\nprocess used in their reproduction, or by a whim on the designer’s part,\nare blue or red not only the sky and the sea, but the ships and the church\nand the people in the streets. The name of Parma, one of the towns that I\nmost longed to visit, after reading the Chartreuse, seeming to me\ncompact and glossy, violet-tinted, soft, if anyone were to speak of such\nor such a house in Parma, in which I should be lodged, he would give me\nthe pleasure of thinking that I was to inhabit a dwelling that was compact\nand glossy, violet-tinted, soft, and that bore no relation to the houses\nin any other town in Italy, since I could imagine it only by the aid of\nthat heavy syllable of the name of Parma, in which no breath of air\nstirred, and of all that I had made it assume of Stendhalian sweetness and\nthe reflected hue of violets. And when I thought of Florence, it was of a\ntown miraculously embalmed, and flower-like, since it was called the City\nof the Lilies, and its Cathedral, Our Lady of the Flower. As for Balbec,\nit was one of those names in which, as on an old piece of Norman pottery\nthat still keeps the colour of the earth from which it was fashioned, one\nsees depicted still the representation of some long-abolished custom, of\nsome feudal right, of the former condition of some place, of an obsolete\nway of pronouncing the language, which had shaped and wedded its\nincongruous syllables and which I never doubted that I should find spoken\nthere at once, even by the inn-keeper who would pour me out coffee and\nmilk on my arrival, taking me down to watch the turbulent sea, unchained,\nbefore the church; to whom I lent the aspect, disputatious, solemn and\nmediaeval, of some character in one of the old romances.",
        "Had my health definitely improved, had my parents allowed me, if not\nactually to go down to stay at Balbec, at least to take, just once, so as\nto become acquainted with the architecture and landscapes of Normandy or\nof Brittany, that one twenty-two train into which I had so often clambered\nin imagination, I should have preferred to stop, and to alight from it, at\nthe most beautiful of its towns; but in vain might I compare and contrast\nthem; how was one to choose, any more than between individual people, who\nare not interchangeable, between Bayeux, so lofty in its noble coronet of\nrusty lace, whose highest point caught the light of the old gold of its\nsecond syllable; Vitré, whose acute accent barred its ancient glass with\nwooden lozenges; gentle Lamballe, whose whiteness ranged from egg-shell\nyellow to a pearly grey; Coutances, a Norman Cathedral, which its final\nconsonants, rich and yellowing, crowned with a tower of butter; Lannion\nwith the rumble and buzz, in the silence of its village street, of the fly\non the wheel of the coach; Questambert, Pontorson, ridiculously silly and\nsimple, white feathers and yellow beaks strewn along the road to those\nwell-watered and poetic spots; Benodet, a name scarcely moored that seemed\nto be striving to draw the river down into the tangle of its seaweeds;\nPont-Aven, the snowy, rosy flight of the wing of a lightly poised coif,\ntremulously reflected in the greenish waters of a canal; Quimperlé, more\nfirmly attached, this, and since the Middle Ages, among the rivulets with\nwhich it babbled, threading their pearls upon a grey background, like the\npattern made, through the cobwebs upon a window, by rays of sunlight\nchanged into blunt points of tarnished silver?",
        "These images were false for another reason also; namely, that they were\nnecessarily much simplified; doubtless the object to which my imagination\naspired, which my senses took in but incompletely and without any\nimmediate pleasure, I had committed to the safe custody of names;\ndoubtless because I had accumulated there a store of dreams, those names\nnow magnetised my desires; but names themselves are not very\ncomprehensive; the most that I could do was to include in each of them two\nor three of the principal curiosities of the town, which would lie there\nside by side, without interval or partition; in the name of Balbec, as in\nthe magnifying glasses set in those penholders which one buys at sea-side\nplaces, I could distinguish waves surging round a church built in the\nPersian manner.  Perhaps, indeed, the enforced simplicity of these images\nwas one of the reasons for the hold that they had over me. When my father\nhad decided, one year, that we should go for the Easter holidays to\nFlorence and Venice, not finding room to introduce into the name of\nFlorence the elements that ordinarily constitute a town, I was obliged to\nlet a supernatural city emerge from the impregnation by certain vernal\nscenes of what I supposed to be, in its essentials, the genius of Giotto.\nAll the more–and because one cannot make a name extend much further in\ntime than in space–like some of Giotto’s paintings themselves which shew\nus at two separate moments the same person engaged in different actions,\nhere lying on his bed, there just about to mount his horse, the name of\nFlorence was divided into two compartments. In one, beneath an\narchitectural dais, I gazed upon a fresco over which was partly drawn a\ncurtain of morning sunlight, dusty, aslant, and gradually spreading; in\nthe other (for, since I thought of names not as an inaccessible ideal but\nas a real and enveloping substance into which I was about to plunge, the\nlife not yet lived, the life intact and pure which I enclosed in them,\ngave to the most material pleasures, to the simplest scenes, the same\nattraction that they have in the works of the Primitives), I moved\nswiftly–so as to arrive, as soon as might be, at the table that was\nspread for me, with fruit and a flask of Chianti–across a Ponte Vecchio\nheaped with jonquils, narcissi and anemones.  That (for all that I was\nstill in Paris) was what I saw, and not what was actually round about me.\nEven from the simplest, the most realistic point of view, the countries\nfor which we long occupy, at any given moment, a far larger place in our\ntrue life than the country in which we may happen to be. Doubtless, if, at\nthat time, I had paid more attention to what was in my mind when I\npronounced the words “going to Florence, to Parma, to Pisa, to Venice,” I\nshould have realised that what I saw was in no sense a town, but something\nas different from anything that I knew, something as delicious as might be\nfor a human race whose whole existence had passed in a series of late\nwinter afternoons, that inconceivable marvel, a morning in spring. These\nimages, unreal, fixed, always alike, filling all my nights and days,\ndifferentiated this period in my life from those which had gone before it\n(and might easily have been confused with it by an observer who saw things\nonly from without, that is to say, who saw nothing), as in an opera a\nfresh melody introduces a novel atmosphere which one could never have\nsuspected if one had done no more than read the libretto, still less if\none had remained outside the theatre, counting only the minutes as they\npassed. And besides, even from the point of view of mere quantity, in our\nlife the days are not all equal. To reach the end of a day, natures that\nare slightly nervous, as mine was, make use, like motor-cars, of different\n’speeds.’ There are mountainous, uncomfortable days, up which one takes an\ninfinite time to pass, and days downward sloping, through which one can go\nat full tilt, singing as one goes. During this month–in which I went\nlaboriously over, as over a tune, though never to my satisfaction, these\nvisions of Florence, Venice, Pisa, from which the desire that they excited\nin me drew and kept something as profoundly personal as if it had been\nlove, love for another person–I never ceased to believe that they\ncorresponded to a reality independent of myself, and they made me\nconscious of as glorious a hope as could have been cherished by a\nChristian in the primitive age of faith, on the eve of his entry into\nParadise. Moreover, without my paying any heed to the contradiction that\nthere was in my wishing to look at and to touch with my organs of sense\nwhat had been elaborated by the spell of my dreams and not perceived by my\nsenses at all–though all the more tempting to them, in consequence, more\ndifferent from anything that they knew–it was that which recalled to me\nthe reality of these visions, which inflamed my desire all the more by\nseeming to hint a promise that my desire should be satisfied. And for all\nthat the motive force of my exaltation was a longing for aesthetic\nenjoyments, the guide-books ministered even more to it than books on\naesthetics, and, more again than the guide-books, the railway time-tables.\nWhat moved me was the thought that this Florence which I could see, so\nnear and yet inaccessible, in my imagination, if the tract which separated\nit from me, in myself, was not one that I might cross, could yet be\nreached by a circuit, by a digression, were I to take the plain,\nterrestrial path. When I repeated to myself, giving thus a special value\nto what I was going to see, that Venice was the “School of Giorgione, the\nhome of Titian, the most complete museum of the domestic architecture of\nthe Middle Ages,” I felt happy indeed. As I was even more when, on one of\nmy walks, as I stepped out briskly on account of the weather, which, after\nseveral days of a precocious spring, had relapsed into winter (like the\nweather that we had invariably found awaiting us at Combray, in Holy\nWeek),–seeing upon the boulevards that the chestnut-trees, though plunged\nin a glacial atmosphere that soaked through them like a stream of water,\nwere none the less beginning, punctual guests, arrayed already for the\nparty, and admitting no discouragement, to shape and chisel and curve in\nits frozen lumps the irrepressible verdure whose steady growth the\nabortive power of the cold might hinder but could not succeed in\nrestraining–I reflected that already the Ponte Vecchio was heaped high\nwith an abundance of hyacinths and anemones, and that the spring sunshine\nwas already tinging the waves of the Grand Canal with so dusky an azure,\nwith emeralds so splendid that when they washed and were broken against\nthe foot of one of Titian’s paintings they could vie with it in the\nrichness of their colouring. I could no longer contain my joy when my\nfather, in the intervals of tapping the barometer and complaining of the\ncold, began to look out which were the best trains, and when I understood\nthat by making one’s way, after luncheon, into the coal-grimed laboratory,\nthe wizard’s cell that undertook to contrive a complete transmutation of\nits surroundings, one could awaken, next morning, in the city of marble\nand gold, in which “the building of the wall was of jasper and the\nfoundation of the wall an emerald.” So that it and the City of the Lilies\nwere not just artificial scenes which I could set up at my pleasure in\nfront of my imagination, but did actually exist at a certain distance from\nParis which must inevitably be traversed if I wished to see them, at their\nappointed place on the earth’s surface, and at no other; in a word they\nwere entirely real. They became even more real to me when my father, by\nsaying: “Well, you can stay in Venice from the 20th to the 29th, and reach\nFlorence on Easter morning,” made them both emerge, no longer only from\nthe abstraction of Space, but from that imaginary Time in which we place\nnot one, merely, but several of our travels at once, which do not greatly\ntax us since they are but possibilities,–that Time which reconstructs\nitself so effectively that one can spend it again in one town after one\nhas already spent it in another–and consecrated to them some of those\nactual, calendar days which are certificates of the genuineness of what\none does on them, for those unique days are consumed by being used, they\ndo not return, one cannot live them again here when one has lived them\nelsewhere; I felt that it was towards the week that would begin with the\nMonday on which the laundress was to bring back the white waistcoat that I\nhad stained with ink, that they were hastening to busy themselves with the\nduty of emerging from that ideal Time in which they did not, as yet,\nexist, those two Queen Cities of which I was soon to be able, by the most\nabsorbing kind of geometry, to inscribe the domes and towers on a page of\nmy own life. But I was still on the way, only, to the supreme pinnacle of\nhappiness; I reached it finally (for not until then did the revelation\nburst upon me that on the clattering streets, reddened by the light\nreflected from Giorgione’s frescoes, it was not, as I had, despite so many\npromptings, continued to imagine, the men “majestic and terrible as the\nsea, bearing armour that gleamed with bronze beneath the folds of their\nblood-red cloaks,” who would be walking in Venice next week, on the Easter\nvigil; but that I myself might be the minute personage whom, in an\nenlarged photograph of St. Mark’s that had been lent to me, the operator\nhad portrayed, in a bowler hat, in front of the portico), when I heard my\nfather say: “It must be pretty cold, still, on the Grand Canal; whatever\nyou do, don’t forget to pack your winter greatcoat and your thick suit.\"\nAt these words I was raised to a sort of ecstasy; a thing that I had until\nthen deemed impossible, I felt myself to be penetrating indeed between\nthose “rocks of amethyst, like a reef in the Indian Ocean\"; by a supreme\nmuscular effort, a long way in excess of my real strength, stripping\nmyself, as of a shell that served no purpose, of the air in my own room\nwhich surrounded me, I replaced it by an equal quantity of Venetian air,\nthat marine atmosphere, indescribable and peculiar as the atmosphere of\nthe dreams which my imagination had secreted in the name of Venice; I\ncould feel at work within me a miraculous disincarnation; it was at once\naccompanied by that vague desire to vomit which one feels when one has a\nvery sore throat; and they had to put me to bed with a fever so persistent\nthat the doctor not only assured my parents that a visit, that spring, to\nFlorence and Venice was absolutely out of the question, but warned their\nthat, even when I should have completely recovered, I must, for at least a\nyear, give up all idea of travelling, and be kept from anything that wa;\nliable to excite me.",
        "And, alas, he forbade also, most categorically, my being allowed to go to\nthe theatre, to hear Berma; the sublime artist, whose genius Bergotte had\nproclaimed, might, by introducing me to something else that was, perhaps,\nas important and as beautiful, have consoled me for not having been to\nFlorence and Venice, for not going to Balbec. My parents had to be content\nwith sending me, every day, to the Champs-Elysées, in the custody of a\nperson who would see that I did not tire myself; this person was none\nother than Françoise, who had entered our service after the death of my\naunt Léonie. Going to the Champs-Elysées I found unendurable.  If only\nBergotte had described the place in one of his books, I should, no doubt,\nhave longed to see and to know it, like so many things else of which a\nsimulacrum had first found its way into my imagination.  That kept things\nwarm, made them live, gave them personality, and I sought then to find\ntheir counterpart in reality, but in this public garden there was nothing\nthat attached itself to my dreams.",
        "One day, as I was weary of our usual place, beside the wooden horses,\nFrançoise had taken me for an excursion–across the frontier guarded at\nregular intervals by the little bastions of the barley-sugar women–into\nthose neighbouring but foreign regions, where the faces of the passers-by\nwere strange, where the goat-carriage went past; then she had gone away to\nlay down her things on a chair that stood with its back to a shrubbery of\nlaurels; while I waited for her I was pacing the broad lawn, of meagre\nclose-cropped grass already faded by the sun, dominated, at its far end,\nby a statue rising from a fountain, in front of which a little girl with\nreddish hair was playing with a shuttlecock; when, from the path, another\nlittle girl, who was putting on her cloak and covering up her battledore,\ncalled out sharply: “Good-bye, Gilberte, I’m going home now; don’t forget,\nwe’re coming to you this evening, after dinner.” The name Gilberte passed\nclose by me, evoking all the more forcibly her whom it labelled in that it\ndid not merely refer to her, as one speaks of a man in his absence, but\nwas directly addressed to her; it passed thus close by me, in action, so\nto speak, with a force that increased with the curve of its trajectory and\nas it drew near to its target;–carrying in its wake, I could feel, the\nknowledge, the impression of her to whom it was addressed that belonged\nnot to me but to the friend who called to her, everything that, while she\nuttered the words, she more or less vividly reviewed, possessed in her\nmemory, of their daily intimacy, of the visits that they paid to each\nother, of that unknown existence which was all the more inaccessible, all\nthe more painful to me from being, conversely, so familiar, so tractable\nto this happy girl who let her message brush past me without my being able\nto penetrate its surface, who flung it on the air with a light-hearted\ncry: letting float in the atmosphere the delicious attar which that\nmessage had distilled, by touching them with precision, from certain\ninvisible points in Mlle.  Swann’s life, from the evening to come, as it\nwould be, after dinner, at her home,–forming, on its celestial passage\nthrough the midst of the children and their nursemaids, a little cloud,\nexquisitely coloured, like the cloud that, curling over one of Poussin’s\ngardens, reflects minutely, like a cloud in the opera, teeming with\nchariots and horses, some apparition of the life of the gods; casting,\nfinally, on that ragged grass, at the spot on which she stood (at once a\nscrap of withered lawn and a moment in the afternoon of the fair player,\nwho continued to beat up and catch her shuttlecock until a governess, with\na blue feather in her hat, had called her away) a marvellous little band\nof light, of the colour of heliotrope, spread over the lawn like a carpet\non which I could not tire of treading to and fro with lingering feet,\nnostalgic and profane, while Françoise shouted: “Come on, button up your\ncoat, look, and let’s get away!” and I remarked for the first time how\ncommon her speech was, and that she had, alas, no blue feather in her hat.",
        "Only, would she come again to the Champs-Elysées? Next day she was not\nthere; but I saw her on the following days; I spent all my time revolving\nround the spot where she was at play with her friends, to such effect that\nonce, when, they found, they were not enough to make up a prisoner’s base,\nshe sent one of them to ask me if I cared to complete their side, and from\nthat day I played with her whenever she came. But this did not happen\nevery day; there were days when she had been prevented from coming by her\nlessons, by her catechism, by a luncheon-party, by the whole of that life,\nseparated from my own, which twice only, condensed into the name of\nGilberte, I had felt pass so painfully close to me, in the hawthorn lane\nnear Combray and on the grass of the Champs-Elysées.  On such days she\nwould have told us beforehand that we should not see her; if it were\nbecause of her lessons, she would say: “It is too tiresome, I sha’n’t be\nable to come to-morrow; you will all be enjoying yourselves here without\nme,” with an air of regret which to some extent consoled me; if, on the\nother hand, she had been invited to a party, and I, not knowing this,\nasked her whether she was coming to play with us, she would reply: “Indeed\nI hope not! Indeed I hope Mamma will let me go to my friend’s.” But on\nthese days I did at least know that I should not see her, whereas on\nothers, without any warning, her mother would take her for a drive, or\nsome such thing, and next day she would say: “Oh, yes! I went out with\nMamma,” as though it had been the most natural thing in the world, and not\nthe greatest possible misfortune for some one else. There were also the\ndays of bad weather on which her governess, afraid, on her own account, of\nthe rain, would not bring Gilberte to the Champs-Elysées.",
        "And so, if the heavens were doubtful, from early morning I would not cease\nto interrogate them, observing all the omens. If I saw the lady opposite,\njust inside her window, putting on her hat, I would say to myself: “That\nlady is going out; it must, therefore, be weather in which one can go out.\nWhy should not Gilberte do the same as that lady?” But the day grew dark.\nMy mother said that it might clear again, that one burst of sunshine would\nbe enough, but that more probably it would rain; and if it rained, of what\nuse would it be to go to the Champs-Elysées? And so, from breakfast-time,\nmy anxious eyes never left the uncertain, clouded sky.  It remained dark:\nOutside the window, the balcony was grey. Suddenly, on its sullen stone, I\ndid not indeed see a less negative colour, but I felt as it were an effort\ntowards a less negative colour, the pulsation of a hesitating ray that\nstruggled to discharge its light. A moment later the balcony was as pale\nand luminous as a standing water at dawn, and a thousand shadows from the\niron-work of its balustrade had come to rest on it. A breath of wind\ndispersed them; the stone grew dark again, but, like tamed creatures, they\nreturned; they began, imperceptibly, to grow lighter, and by one of those\ncontinuous crescendos, such as, in music, at the end of an overture, carry\na single note to the extreme fortissimo, making it pass rapidly through\nall the intermediate stages, I saw it attain to that fixed, unalterable\ngold of fine days, on which the sharply cut shadows of the wrought iron of\nthe balustrade were outlined in black like a capricious vegetation, with a\nfineness in the delineation of their smallest details which seemed to\nindicate a deliberate application, an artist’s satisfaction, and with so\nmuch relief, so velvety a bloom in the restfulness of their sombre and\nhappy mass that in truth those large and leafy shadows which lay reflected\non that lake of sunshine seemed aware that they were pledges of happiness\nand peace of mind.",
        "Brief, fading ivy, climbing, fugitive flora, the most colourless, the most\ndepressing, to many minds, of all that creep on walls or decorate windows;\nto me the dearest of them all, from the day when it appeared upon our\nbalcony, like the very shadow of the presence of Gilberte, who was perhaps\nalready in the Champs-Elysées, and as soon as I arrived there would greet\nme with: “Let’s begin at once. You are on my side.” Frail, swept away by a\nbreath, but at the same time in harmony, not with the season, with the\nhour; a promise of that immediate pleasure which the day will deny or\nfulfil, and thereby of the one paramount immediate pleasure, the pleasure\nof loving and of being loved; more soft, more warm upon tie stone than\neven moss is; alive, a ray of sunshine sufficing for its birth, and for\nthe birth of joy, even in the heart of winter.",
        "And on those days when all other vegetation had disappeared, when the fine\njerkins of green leather which covered the trunks of the old trees were\nhidden beneath the snow; after the snow had ceased to fall, but when the\nsky was still too much overcast for me to hope that Gilberte would venture\nout, then suddenly–inspiring my mother to say: “Look, it’s quite fine\nnow; I think you might perhaps try going to the Champs-Elysées after\nall.\"–On the mantle of snow that swathed the balcony, the sun had\nappeared and was stitching seams of gold, with embroidered patches of dark\nshadow. That day we found no one there, or else a solitary girl, on the\npoint of departure, who assured me that Gilberte was not coming. The\nchairs, deserted by the imposing but uninspiring company of governesses,\nstood empty. Only, near the grass, was sitting a lady of uncertain age who\ncame in all weathers, dressed always in an identical style, splendid and\nsombre, to make whose acquaintance I would have, at that period,\nsacrificed, had it lain in my power, all the greatest opportunities in my\nlife to come. For Gilberte went up every day to speak to her; she used to\nask Gilberte for news of her “dearest mother” and it struck me that, if I\nhad known her, I should have been for Gilberte some one wholly different,\nsome one who knew people in her parents’ world. While her grandchildren\nplayed together at a little distance, she would sit and read the Débats,\nwhich she called “My old Débats!” as, with an aristocratic familiarity,\nshe would say, speaking of the police-sergeant or the woman who let the\nchairs, “My old friend the police-sergeant,” or “The chair-keeper and I,\nwho are old friends.”",
        "Françoise found it too cold to stand about, so we walked to the Pont de la\nConcorde to see the Seine frozen over, on to which everyone, even\nchildren, walked fearlessly, as though upon an enormous whale, stranded,\ndefenceless, and about to be cut up. We returned to the Champs-Elysées; I\nwas growing sick with misery between the motionless wooden horses and the\nwhite lawn, caught in a net of black paths from which the snow had been\ncleared, while the statue that surmounted it held in its hand a long\npendent icicle which seemed to explain its gesture. The old lady herself,\nhaving folded up her Débats, asked a passing nursemaid the time,\nthanking her with “How very good of you!” then begged the road-sweeper to\ntell her grandchildren to come, as she felt cold, adding “A thousand\nthanks. I am sorry to give you so much trouble!” Suddenly the sky was rent\nin two: between the punch-and-judy and the horses, against the opening\nhorizon, I had just seen, like a miraculous sign, Mademoiselle’s blue\nfeather. And now Gilberte was running at full speed towards me, sparkling\nand rosy beneath a cap trimmed with fur, enlivened by the cold, by being\nlate, by her anxiety for a game; shortly before she reached me, she\nslipped on a piece of ice and, either to regain her balance, or because it\nappeared to her graceful, or else pretending that she was on skates, it\nwas with outstretched arms that she smilingly advanced, as though to\nembrace me. “Bravo! bravo! that’s splendid; ’topping,’ I should say, like\nyou–’sporting,’ I suppose I ought to say, only I’m a hundred-and-one, a\nwoman of the old school,” exclaimed the lady, uttering, on behalf of the\nvoiceless Champs-Elysées, their thanks to Gilberte for having come,\nwithout letting herself be frightened away by the weather. “You are like\nme, faithful at all costs to our old Champs-Elysées; we are two brave\nsouls!  You wouldn’t believe me, I dare say, if I told you that I love\nthem, even like this. This snow (I know, you’ll laugh at me), it makes me\nthink of ermine!” And the old lady began to laugh herself.",
        "The first of these days–to which the snow, a symbol of the powers that\nwere able to deprive me of the sight of Gilberte, imparted the sadness of\na day of separation, almost the aspect of a day of departure, because it\nchanged the outward form and almost forbade the use of the customary scene\nof our only encounters, now altered, covered, as it were, in\ndust-sheets–that day, none the less, marked a stage in the progress of my\nlove, for it was, in a sense, the first sorrow that she was to share with\nme. There were only our two selves of our little company, and to be thus\nalone with her was not merely like a beginning of intimacy, but also on\nher part–as though she had come there solely to please me, and in such\nweather–it seemed to me as touching as if, on one of those days on which\nshe had been invited to a party, she had given it up in order to come to\nme in the Champs-Elysées; I acquired more confidence in the vitality, in\nthe future of a friendship which could remain so much alive amid the\ntorpor, the solitude, the decay of our surroundings; and while she dropped\npellets of snow down my neck, I smiled lovingly at what seemed to me at\nonce a predilection that she shewed for me in thus tolerating me as her\ntravelling companion in this new, this wintry land, and a sort of loyalty\nto me which she preserved through evil times. Presently, one after\nanother, like shyly bopping sparrows, her friends arrived, black against\nthe snow. We got ready to play and, since this day which had begun so\nsadly was destined to end in joy, as I went up, before the game started,\nto the friend with the sharp voice whom I had heard, that first day,\ncalling Gilberte by name, she said to me: “No, no, I’m sure you’d much\nrather be in Gilberte’s camp; besides, look, she’s signalling to you.” She\nwas in fact summoning me to cross the snowy lawn to her camp, to ’take the\nfield,’ which the sun, by casting over it a rosy gleam, the metallic\nlustre of old and worn brocades, had turned into a Field of the Cloth of\nGold.",
        "This day, which I had begun with so many misgivings, was, as it happened,\none of the few on which I was not unduly wretched.",
        "For, although I no longer thought, now, of anything save not to let a\nsingle day pass without seeing Gilberte (so much so that once, when my\ngrandmother had not come home by dinner-time, I could not resist the\ninstinctive reflection that, if she had been run over in the street and\nkilled, I should not for some time be allowed to play in the\nChamps-Elysées; when one is in love one has no love left for anyone), yet\nthose moments which I spent in her company, for which I had waited with so\nmuch impatience all night and morning, for which I had quivered with\nexcitement, to which I would have sacrificed everything else in the world,\nwere by no means happy moments; well did I know it, for they were the only\nmoments in my life on which I concentrated a scrupulous, undistracted\nattention, and yet I could not discover in them one atom of pleasure. All\nthe time that I was away from Gilberte, I wanted to see her, because,\nhaving incessantly sought to form a mental picture of her, I was unable,\nin the end, to do so, and did not know exactly to what my love\ncorresponded.  Besides, she had never yet told me that she loved me. Far\nfrom it, she had often boasted that she knew other little boys whom she\npreferred to myself, that I was a good companion, with whom she was always\nwilling to play, although I was too absent-minded, not attentive enough to\nthe game. Moreover, she had often shewn signs of apparent coldness towards\nme, which might have shaken my faith that I was for her a creature\ndifferent from the rest, had that faith been founded upon a love that\nGilberte had felt for me, and not, as was the case, upon the love that I\nfelt for her, which strengthened its resistance to the assaults of doubt\nby making it depend entirely upon the manner in which I was obliged, by an\ninternal compulsion, to think of Gilberte. But my feelings with regard to\nher I had never yet ventured to express to her in words. Of course, on\nevery page of my exercise-books, I wrote out, in endless repetition, her\nname and address, but at the sight of those vague lines which I might\ntrace, without her having to think, on that account, of me, I felt\ndiscouraged, because they spoke to me, not of Gilberte, who would never so\nmuch as see them, but of my own desire, which they seemed to shew me in\nits true colours, as something purely personal, unreal, tedious and\nineffective. The most important thing was that we should see each other,\nGilberte and I, and should have an opportunity of making a mutual\nconfession of our love which, until then, would not officially (so to\nspeak) have begun. Doubtless the various reasons which made me so\nimpatient to see her would have appeared less urgent to a grown man. As\nlife goes on, we acquire such adroitness in the culture of our pleasures,\nthat we content ourselves with that which we derive from thinking of a\nwoman, as I was thinking of Gilberte, without troubling ourselves to\nascertain whether the image corresponds to the reality,–and with the\npleasure of loving her, without needing to be sure, also, that she loves\nus; or again that we renounce the pleasure of confessing our passion for\nher, so as to preserve and enhance the passion that she has for us, like\nthose Japanese gardeners who, to obtain one perfect blossom, will\nsacrifice the rest. But at the period when I was in love with Gilberte, I\nstill believed that Love did really exist, apart from ourselves; that,\nallowing us, at the most, to surmount the obstacles in our way, it offered\nus its blessings in an order in which we were not free to make the least\nalteration; it seemed to me that if I had, on my own initiative,\nsubstituted for the sweetness of a confession a pretence of indifference,\nI should not only have been depriving myself of one of the joys of which I\nhad most often dreamed, I should have been fabricating, of my own free\nwill, a love that was artificial and without value, that bore no relation\nto the truth, whose mysterious and foreordained ways I should thus have\nbeen declining to follow.",
        "But when I arrived at the Champs-Elysées,–and, as at first sight it\nappeared, was in a position to confront my love, so as to make it undergo\nthe necessary modifications, with its living and independent cause–as\nsoon as I was in the presence of that Gilberte Swann on the sight of whom\nI had counted to revive the images that my tired memory had lost and could\nnot find again, of that Gilberte Swann with whom I had been playing the\nday before, and whom I had just been prompted to greet, and then to\nrecognise, by a blind instinct like that which, when we are walking, sets\none foot before the other, without giving us time to think what we are\ndoing, then at once it became as though she and the little girl who had\ninspired my dreams had been two different people. If, for instance, I had\nretained in my memory overnight two fiery eyes above plump and rosy\ncheeks, Gilberte’s face would now offer me (and with emphasis) something\nthat I distinctly had not remembered, a certain sharpening and\nprolongation of the nose which, instantaneously associating itself with\ncertain others of her features, assumed the importance of those\ncharacteristics which, in natural history, are used to define a species,\nand transformed her into a little girl of the kind that have sharpened\nprofiles.  While I was making myself ready to take advantage of this long\nexpected moment, and to surrender myself to the impression of Gilberte\nwhich I had prepared beforehand but could no longer find in my head, to an\nextent which would enable me, during the long hours which I must spend\nalone, to be certain that it was indeed herself whom I had in mind, that\nit was indeed my love for her that I was gradually making grow, as a book\ngrows when one is writing it, she threw me a ball; and, like the idealist\nphilosopher whose body takes account of the external world in the reality\nof which his intellect declines to believe, the same self which had made\nme salute her before I had identified her now urged me to catch the ball\nthat she tossed to me (as though she had been a companion, with whom I had\ncome to play, and not a sister-soul with whom my soul had come to be\nlimited), made me, out of politeness, until the time came when she had to\nI go, address a thousand polite and trivial remarks to her, and so\nprevented me both from keeping a silence in which I might at last have\nlaid my hand upon the indispensable, escaped idea, and from uttering the\nwords which might have made that definite progress in the course of our\nlove on which I was always obliged to count only for the following\nafternoon. There was, however, an occasional development. One day, we had\ngone with Gilberte to the stall of our own special vendor, who was always\nparticularly nice to us, since it was to her that M. Swann used to send\nfor his gingerbread, of which, for reasons of health (he suffered from a\nracial eczema, and from the constipation of the prophets), he consumed a\ngreat quantity,–Gilberte pointed out to me with a laugh two little boys\nwho were like the little artist and the little naturalist in the\nchildren’s storybooks. For one of them would not have a red stick of rock\nbecause he preferred the purple, while the other, with tears in his eyes,\nrefused a plum which his nurse was buying for him, because, as he finally\nexplained in passionate tones: “I want the other plum; it’s got a worm in\nit!” I purchased two ha’penny marbles. With admiring eyes I saw, luminous\nand imprisoned in a bowl by themselves, the agate marbles which seemed\nprecious to me because they were as fair and smiling as little girls, and\nbecause they cost five-pence each. Gilberte, who was given a great deal\nmore pocket money than I ever had, asked me which I thought the prettiest.\nThey were as transparent, as liquid-seeming as life itself. I would not\nhave had her sacrifice a single one of them. I should have liked her to be\nable to buy them, to liberate them all. Still, I pointed out one that had\nthe same colour as her eyes. Gilberte took it, turned it about until it\nshone with a ray of gold, fondled it, paid its ransom, but at once handed\nme her captive, saying: “Take it; it is for you, I give it to you, keep it\nto remind yourself of me.”",
        "Another time, being still obsessed by the desire to hear Berma in classic\ndrama, I had asked her whether she had not a copy of a pamphlet in which\nBergotte spoke of Racine, and which was now out of print. She had told me\nto let her know the exact title of it, and that evening I had sent her a\nlittle telegram, writing on its envelope the name, Gilberte Swann, which I\nhad so often, traced in my exercise-books.  Next day she brought me in a\nparcel tied with pink bows and sealed with white wax, the pamphlet, a copy\nof which she had managed to find. “You see, it is what you asked me for,\"\nshe said, taking from her muff the telegram that I had sent her.  But in\nthe address on the pneumatic message–which, only yesterday, was nothing,\nwas merely a ’little blue’ that I had written, and, after a messenger had\ndelivered it to Gilberte’s porter and a servant had taken it to her in her\nroom, had become a thing without value or distinction, one of the ’little\nblues’ that she had received in the course of the day–I had difficulty in\nrecognising the futile, straggling lines of my own handwriting beneath the\ncircles stamped on it at the post-office, the inscriptions added in pencil\nby a postman, signs of effectual realisation, seals of the external world,\nviolet bands symbolical of life itself, which for the first time came to\nespouse, to maintain, to raise, to rejoice my dream.",
        "And there was another day on which she said to me: “You know, you may call\nme ’Gilberte’; in any case, I’m going to call you by your first name. It’s\ntoo silly not to.” Yet she continued for a while to address me by the more\nformal ’vous,’ and, when I drew her attention to this, smiled, and\ncomposing, constructing a phrase like those that are put into the\ngrammar-books of foreign languages with no other object than to teach us\nto make use of a new word, ended it with my Christian name. And when I\nrecalled, later, what I had felt at the time, I could distinguish the\nimpression of having been held, for a moment, in her mouth, myself, naked,\nwithout, any longer, any of the social qualifications which belonged\nequally to her other companions and, when she used my surname, to my\nparents, accessories of which her lips–by the effort that she made, a\nlittle after her father’s manner, to articulate the words to which she\nwished to give a special value–had the air of stripping, of divesting me,\nas one peels the skin from a fruit of which one is going to put only the\npulp into one’s mouth, while her glance, adapting itself to the same new\ndegree of intimacy as her speech, fell on me also more directly, not\nwithout testifying to the consciousness, the pleasure, even the gratitude\nthat it felt, accompanying itself with a smile.",
        "But at that actual moment, I was not able to appreciate the worth of these\nnew pleasures. They were given, not by the little girl whom I loved, to me\nwho loved her, but by the other, her with whom I used to play, to my other\nself, who possessed neither the memory of the true Gilberte, nor the fixed\nheart which alone could have known the value of a happiness for which it\nalone had longed. Even after I had returned home I did not taste them,\nsince, every day, the necessity which made me hope that on the morrow I\nshould arrive at the clear, calm, happy contemplation of Gilberte, that\nshe would at last confess her love for me, explaining to me the reasons by\nwhich she had been obliged, hitherto, to conceal it, that same necessity\nforced me to regard the past as of no account, to look ahead of me only,\nto consider the little advantages that she had given me not in themselves\nand as if they were self-sufficient, but like fresh rungs of the ladder on\nwhich I might set my feet, which were going to allow me to advance a step\nfurther and finally to attain the happiness which I had not yet\nencountered.",
        "If, at times, she shewed me these marks of her affection, she troubled me\nalso by seeming not to be pleased to see me, and this happened often on\nthe very days on which I had most counted for the realisation of my hopes.\nI was sure that Gilberte was coming to the Champs-Elysées, and I felt an\nelation which seemed merely the anticipation of a great happiness\nwhen–going into the drawing-room in the morning to kiss Mamma, who was\nalready dressed to go out, the coils of her black hair elaborately built\nup, and her beautiful hands, plump and white, fragrant still with soap–I\nhad been apprised, by seeing a column of dust standing by itself in the\nair above the piano, and by hearing a barrel-organ playing, beneath the\nwindow, En revenant de la revue, that the winter had received, until\nnightfall, an unexpected, radiant visit from a day of spring. While we sat\nat luncheon, by opening her window, the lady opposite had sent packing, in\nthe twinkling of an eye, from beside my chair–to sweep in a single stride\nover the whole width of our dining-room–a sunbeam which had lain down\nthere for its midday rest and returned to continue it there a moment\nlater.  At school, during the one o’clock lesson, the sun made me sick\nwith impatience and boredom as it let fall a golden stream that crept to\nthe edge of my desk, like an invitation to the feast at which I could not\nmyself arrive before three o’clock, until the moment when Françoise came\nto fetch me at the school-gate, and we made our way towards the\nChamps-Elysées through streets decorated with sunlight, dense with people,\nover which the balconies, detached by the sun and made vaporous, seemed to\nfloat in front of the houses like clouds of gold. Alas! in the\nChamps-Elysées I found no Gilberte; she had not yet arrived. Motionless,\non the lawn nurtured by the invisible sun which, here and there, kindled\nto a flame the point of a blade of grass, while the pigeons that had\nalighted upon it had the appearance of ancient sculptures which the\ngardener’s pick had heaved to the surface of a hallowed soil, I stood with\nmy eyes fixed on the horizon, expecting at every moment to see appear the\nform of Gilberte following that of her governess, behind the statue that\nseemed to be holding out the child, which it had in its arms, and which\nglistened in the stream of light, to receive benediction from the sun. The\nold lady who read the Débats was sitting on her chair, in her invariable\nplace, and had just accosted a park-keeper, with a friendly wave of her\nhands towards him as she exclaimed “What a lovely day!” And when the\nchair-woman came up to collect her penny, with an infinity of smirks and\naffectations she folded the ticket away inside her glove, as though it had\nbeen a posy of flowers, for which she had sought, in gratitude to the\ndonor, the most becoming place upon her person. When she had found it, she\nperformed a circular movement with her neck, straightened her boa, and\nfastened upon the collector, as she shewed her the end of yellow paper\nthat stuck out over her bare wrist, the bewitching smile with which a\nwoman says to a young man, pointing to her bosom: “You see, I’m wearing\nyour roses!”",
        "I dragged Françoise, on the way towards Gilberte, as far as the Arc de\nTriomphe; we did not meet her, and I was returning towards the lawn\nconvinced, now, that she was not coming, when, in front of the wooden\nhorses, the little girl with the sharp voice flung herself upon me:\n\"Quick, quick, Gilberte’s been here a quarter of an hour. She’s just\ngoing. We’ve been waiting for you, to make up a prisoner’s base.”",
        "While I had been going up the Avenue des Champs-Elysées, Gilberte had\narrived by the Rue Boissy-d’Anglas, Mademoiselle having taken advantage of\nthe fine weather to go on some errand of her own; and M. Swann was coming\nto fetch his daughter. And so it was my fault; I ought not to have strayed\nfrom the lawn; for one never knew for certain from what direction Gilberte\nwould appear, whether she would be early or late, and this perpetual\ntension succeeded in making more impressive not only the Champs-Elysées in\ntheir entirety, and the whole span of the afternoon, like a vast expanse\nof space and time, on every point and at every moment of which it was\npossible that the form of Gilberte might appear, but also that form\nitself, since behind its appearance I felt that there lay concealed the\nreason for which it had shot its arrow into my heart at four o’clock\ninstead of at half-past two; crowned with a smart hat, for paying calls,\ninstead of the plain cap, for games; in front of the Ambassadeurs and not\nbetween the two puppet-shows; I divined one of those occupations in which\nI might not follow Gilberte, occupations that forced her to go out or to\nstay at home, I was in contact with the mystery of her unknown life.  It\nwas this mystery, too, which troubled me when, running at the sharp-voiced\ngirl’s bidding, so as to begin our game without more delay, I saw\nGilberte, so quick and informal with us, make a ceremonious bow to the old\nlady with the Débats (who acknowledged it with “What a lovely sun!\nYou’d think there was a fire burning.”) speaking to her with a shy smile,\nwith an air of constraint which called to my mind the other little girl\nthat Gilberte must be when at home with her parents, or with friends of\nher parents, paying visits, in all the rest, that escaped me, of her\nexistence. But of that existence no one gave me so strong an impression as\ndid M. Swann, who came a little later to fetch his daughter. That was\nbecause he and Mme.  Swann–inasmuch as their daughter lived with them, as\nher lessons, her games, her friendships depended upon them–contained for\nme, like Gilberte, perhaps even more than Gilberte, as befitted subjects\nthat had an all-powerful control over her in whom it must have had its\nsource, an undefined, an inaccessible quality of melancholy charm.\nEverything that concerned them was on my part the object of so constant a\npreoccupation that the days on which, as on this day, M. Swann (whom I had\nseen so often, long ago, without his having aroused my curiosity, when he\nwas still on good terms with my parents) came for Gilberte to the\nChamps-Elysées, once the pulsations to which my heart had been excited by\nthe appearance of his grey hat and hooded cape had subsided, the sight of\nhim still impressed me as might that of an historic personage, upon whom\none had just been studying a series of books, and the smallest details of\nwhose life one learned with enthusiasm. His relations with the Comte de\nParis, which, when I heard them discussed at Combray, seemed to me\nunimportant, became now in my eyes something marvellous, as if no one else\nhad ever known the House of Orleans; they set him in vivid detachment\nagainst the vulgar background of pedestrians of different classes, who\nencumbered that particular path in the Champs-Elysées, in the midst of\nwhom I admired his condescending to figure without claiming any special\ndeference, which as it happened none of them dreamed of paying him, so\nprofound was the incognito in which he was wrapped.",
        "He responded politely to the salutations of Gilberte’s companions, even to\nmine, for all that he was no longer on good terms with my family, but\nwithout appearing to know who I was. (This reminded me that he had\nconstantly seen me in the country; a memory which I had retained, but kept\nout of sight, because, since I had seen Gilberte again, Swann had become\nto me pre-eminently her father, and no longer the Combray Swann; as the\nideas which, nowadays, I made his name connote were different from the\nideas in the system of which it was formerly comprised, which I utilised\nnot at all now when I had occasion to think of him, he had become a new,\nanother person; still I attached him by an artificial thread, secondary\nand transversal, to our former guest; and as nothing had any longer any\nvalue for me save in the extent to which my love might profit by it, it\nwas with a spasm of shame and of regret at not being able to erase them\nfrom my memory that I recaptured the years in which, in the eyes of this\nsame Swann who was at this moment before me in the Champs-Elysées, and to\nwhom, fortunately, Gilberte had perhaps not mentioned my name, I had so\noften, in the evenings, made myself ridiculous by sending to ask Mamma to\ncome upstairs to my room to say good-night to me, while she was drinking\ncoffee with him and my father and my grandparents at the table in the\ngarden.) He told Gilberte that she might play one game; he could wait for\na quarter of an hour; and, sitting down, just like anyone else, on an iron\nchair, paid for his ticket with that hand which Philippe VII had so often\nheld in his own, while we began our game upon the lawn, scattering the\npigeons, whose beautiful, iridescent bodies (shaped like hearts and,\nsurely, the lilacs of the feathered kingdom) took refuge as in so many\nsanctuaries, one on the great basin of stone, on which its beak, as it\ndisappeared below the rim, conferred the part, assigned the purpose of\noffering to the bird in abundance the fruit or grain at which it appeared\nto be pecking, another on the head of the statue, which it seemed to crown\nwith one of those enamelled objects whose polychrome varies in certain\nclassical works the monotony of the stone, and with an attribute which,\nwhen the goddess bears it, entitles her to a particular epithet and makes\nof her, as a different Christian name makes of a mortal, a fresh divinity.",
        "On one of these sunny days which had not realised my hopes, I had not the\ncourage to conceal my disappointment from Gilberte.",
        "“I had ever so many things to ask you,” I said to her; “I thought that\nto-day was going to mean so much in our friendship. And no sooner have you\ncome than you go away! Try to come early to-morrow, so that I can talk to\nyou.”",
        "Her face lighted up and she jumped for joy as she answered: “Tomorrow, you\nmay make up your mind, my dear friend, I sha’n’t come!",
        "“First of all I’ve a big luncheon-party; then in the afternoon I am going\nto a friend’s house to see King Theodosius arrive from her windows; won’t\nthat be splendid?–and then, next day, I’m going to Michel Strogoff, and\nafter that it will soon be Christmas, and the New Year holidays! Perhaps\nthey’ll take me south, to the Riviera; won’t that be nice? Though I should\nmiss the Christmas-tree here; anyhow, if I do stay in Paris, I sha’n’t be\ncoming here, because I shall be out paying calls with Mamma.\nGood-bye–there’s Papa calling me.”",
        "I returned home with Françoise through streets that were still gay with\nsunshine, as on the evening of a holiday when the merriment is over. I\ncould scarcely drag my legs along.",
        "“I’m not surprised;” said Françoise, “it’s not the right weather for the\ntime of year; it’s much too warm. Oh dear, oh dear, to think of all the\npoor sick people there must be everywhere; you would think that up there,\ntoo, everything’s got out of order.”",
        "I repeated to myself, stifling my sobs, the words in which Gilberte had\ngiven utterance to her joy at the prospect of not coming back, for a long\ntime, to the Champs-Elysées. But already the charm with which, by the mere\nact of thinking, my mind was filled as soon as it thought of her, the\nprivileged position, unique even if it were painful, in which I was\ninevitably placed in relation to Gilberte by the contraction of a scar in\nmy mind, had begun to add to that very mark of her indifference something\nromantic, and in the midst of my tears my lips would shape themselves in a\nsmile which was indeed the timid outline of a kiss. And when the time came\nfor the postman I said to myself, that evening as on every other: “I am\ngoing to have a letter from Gilberte, she is going to tell me, at last,\nthat she has never ceased to love me, and to explain to me the mysterious\nreason by which she has been forced to conceal her love from me until now,\nto put on the appearance of being able to be happy without seeing me; the\nreason for which she has assumed the form of the other Gilberte, who is\nsimply a companion.”",
        "Every evening I would beguile myself into imagining this letter, believing\nthat I was actually reading it, reciting each of its sentences in turn.\nSuddenly I would stop, in alarm. I had realised that, if I was to receive\na letter from Gilberte, it could not, in any case, be this letter, since\nit was I myself who had just composed it. And from that moment I would\nstrive to keep my thoughts clear of the words which I should have liked\nher to write to me, from fear lest, by first selecting them myself, I\nshould be excluding just those identical words,–the dearest, the most\ndesired–from the field of possible events. Even if, by an almost\nimpossible coincidence, it had been precisely the letter of my invention\nthat Gilberte had addressed to me of her own accord, recognising my own\nwork in it I should not have had the impression that I was receiving\nsomething that had not originated in myself, something real, something\nnew, a happiness external to my mind, independent of my will, a gift\nindeed from love.",
        "While I waited I read over again a page which, although it had not been\nwritten to me by Gilberte, came to me, none the less, from her, that page\nby Bergotte upon the beauty of the old myths from which Racine drew his\ninspiration, which (with the agate marble) I always kept within reach.  I\nwas touched by my friend’s kindness in having procured the book for me;\nand as everyone is obliged to find some reason for his passion, so much so\nthat he is glad to find in the creature whom he loves qualities which (he\nhas learned by reading or in conversation) are worthy to excite a man’s\nlove, that he assimilates them by imitation and makes out of them fresh\nreasons for his love, even although these qualities be diametrically\nopposed to those for which his love would have sought, so long as it was\nspontaneous–as Swann, before my day, had sought to establish the\naesthetic basis of Odette’s beauty–I, who had at first loved Gilberte, in\nCombray days, on account of all the unknown element in her life into which\nI would fain have plunged headlong, have undergone reincarnation,\ndiscarding my own separate existence as a thing that no longer mattered, I\nthought now, as of an inestimable advantage, that of this, my own, my too\nfamiliar, my contemptible existence Gilberte might one day become the\nhumble servant, the kindly, the comforting collaborator, who in the\nevenings, helping me in my work, would collate for me the texts of rare\npamphlets. As for Bergotte, that infinitely wise, almost divine old man,\nbecause of whom I had first, before I had even seen her, loved Gilberte,\nnow it was for Gilberte’s sake, chiefly, that I loved him. With as much\npleasure as the pages that he had written about Racine, I studied the\nwrapper, folded under great seals of white wax and tied with billows of\npink ribbon, in which she had brought those pages to me. I kissed the\nagate marble, which was the better part of my love’s heart, the part that\nwas not frivolous but faithful, and, for all that it was adorned with the\nmysterious charm of Gilberte’s life, dwelt close beside me, inhabited my\nchamber, shared my bed. But the beauty of that stone, and the beauty also\nof those pages of Bergotte which I was glad to associate with the idea of\nmy love for Gilberte, as if, in the moments when my love seemed no longer\nto have any existence, they gave it a kind of consistency, were, I\nperceived, anterior to that love, which they in no way resembled; their\nelements had been determined by the writer’s talent, or by geological\nlaws, before ever Gilberte had known me, nothing in book or stone would\nhave been different if Gilberte had not loved me, and there was nothing,\nconsequently, that authorised me to read in them a message of happiness.\nAnd while my love, incessantly waiting for the morrow to bring a\nconfession of Gilberte’s love for me, destroyed, unravelled every evening,\nthe ill-done work of the day, in some shadowed part of my being was an\nunknown weaver who would not leave where they lay the severed threads, but\ncollected and rearranged them, without any thought of pleasing me, or of\ntoiling for my advantage, in the different order which she gave to all her\nhandiwork.  Without any special interest in my love, not beginning by\ndeciding that I was loved, she placed, side by side, those of Gilberte’s\nactions that had seemed to me inexplicable and her faults which I had\nexcused. Then, one with another, they took on a meaning. It seemed to tell\nme, this new arrangement, that when I saw Gilberte, instead of coming to\nme in the Champs-Elysées, going to a party, or on errands with her\ngoverness, when I saw her prepared for an absence that would extend over\nthe New Year holidays, I was wrong in thinking, in saying: “It is because\nshe is frivolous,” or “easily lead.” For she would have ceased to be\neither if she had loved me, and if she had been forced to obey it would\nhave been with the same despair in her heart that I felt on the days when\nI did not see her. It shewed me further, this new arrangement, that I\nought, after all, to know what it was to love, since I loved Gilberte; it\ndrew my attention to the constant anxiety that I had to ’shew off’ before\nher, by reason of which I tried to persuade my mother to get for Françoise\na waterproof coat and a hat with a blue feather, or, better still, to stop\nsending with me to the Champs-Elysées an attendant with whom I blushed to\nbe seen (to all of which my mother replied that I was not fair to\nFrançoise, that she was an excellent woman and devoted to us all) and also\nthat sole, exclusive need to see Gilberte, the result of which was that,\nmonths in advance, I could think of nothing but how to find out at what\ndate she would be leaving Paris and where she was going, feeling that the\nmost attractive country in the world would be but a place of exile if she\nwere not to be there, and asking only to be allowed to stay for ever in\nParis, so long as I might see her in the Champs-Elysées; and it had little\ndifficulty in making me see that neither my anxiety nor my need could be\njustified by anything in Gilberte’s conduct. She, on the contrary, was\ngenuinely fond of her governess, without troubling herself over what I\nmight choose to think about it. It seemed quite natural to her not to come\nto the Champs-Elysées if she had to go shopping with Mademoiselle,\ndelightful if she had to go out somewhere with her mother. And even\nsupposing that she would ever have allowed me to spend my holidays in the\nsame place as herself, when it came to choosing that place she considered\nher parents’ wishes, a thousand different amusements of which she had been\ntold, and not at all that it should be the place to which my family were\nproposing to send me. When she assured me (as sometimes happened) that she\nliked me less than some other of her friends, less than she had liked me\nthe day before, because by my clumsiness I had made her side lose a game,\nI would beg her pardon, I would beg her to tell me what I must do in order\nthat she should begin again to like me as much as, or more than the rest;\nI hoped to hear her say that that was already my position; I besought her;\nas though she had been able to modify her affection for me as she or I\nchose, to give me pleasure, merely by the words that she would utter, as\nmy good or bad conduct should deserve. Was I, then, not yet aware that\nwhat I felt, myself, for her, depended neither upon her actions nor upon\nmy desires?",
        "It shewed me finally, the new arrangement planned by my unseen weaver,\nthat, if we find ourselves hoping that the actions of a person who has\nhitherto caused us anxiety may prove not to have been sincere, they shed\nin their wake a light which our hopes are powerless to extinguish, a light\nto which, rather than to our hopes, we must put the question, what will be\nthat person’s actions on the morrow.",
        "These new counsels, my love listened and heard them; they persuaded it\nthat the morrow would not be different from all the days that had gone\nbefore; that Gilberte’s feeling for me, too long established now to be\ncapable of alteration, was indifference; that hi my friendship with\nGilberte, it was I alone who loved. “That is true,” my love responded,\n\"there is nothing more to be made of that friendship. It will not alter\nnow.” And so the very next day (unless I were to wait for a public\nholiday, if there was one approaching, some anniversary, the New Year,\nperhaps, one of those days which are not like other days, on which time\nstarts afresh, casting aside the heritage of the past, declining its\nlegacy of sorrows) I would appeal to Gilberte to terminate our old and to\njoin me in laying the foundations of a new friendship.",
        "I had always, within reach, a plan of Paris, which, because I could see\ndrawn on it the street in which M. and Mme. Swann lived, seemed to me to\ncontain a secret treasure. And to please myself, as well as by a sort of\nchivalrous loyalty, in any connection or with no relevance at all, I would\nrepeat the name of that street until my father, not being, like my mother\nand grandmother, in the secret of my love, would ask: “But why are you\nalways talking about that street? There’s nothing wonderful about it. It\nis an admirable street to live in because it’s only a few minutes’ walk\nfrom the Bois, but there are a dozen other streets just the same.”",
        "I made every effort to introduce the name of Swann into my conversation\nwith my parents; in my own mind, of course, I never ceased to murmur it;\nbut I needed also to hear its exquisite sound, and to make myself play\nthat chord, the voiceless rendering of which did not suffice me. Moreover,\nthat name of Swann, with which I had for so long been familiar, was to me\nnow (as happens at times to people suffering from aphasia, in the case of\nthe most ordinary words) the name of something new. It was for ever\npresent in my mind, which could not, however, grow accustomed to it. I\nanalysed it, I spelt it; its orthography came to me as a surprise.  And\nwith its familiarity it had simultaneously lost its innocence. The\npleasure that I derived from the sound of it I felt to be so guilty, that\nit seemed to me as though the others must read my thoughts, and would\nchange the conversation if I endeavoured to guide it in that direction. I\nfell back upon subjects which still brought me into touch with Gilberte, I\neternally repeated the same words, and it was no use my knowing that they\nwere but words–words uttered in her absence, which she could not hear,\nwords without virtue in themselves, repeating what were, indeed, facts,\nbut powerless to modify them–for still it seemed to me that by dint of\nhandling, of stirring in this way everything that had reference to\nGilberte, I might perhaps make emerge from it something that would bring\nme happiness. I told my parents again that Gilberte was very fond of her\ngoverness, as if the statement, when repeated for the hundredth time,\nwould at last have the effect of making Gilberte suddenly burst into the\nroom, come to live with us for ever. I had already sung the praises of the\nold lady who read the Débats (I had hinted to my parents that she must\nat least be an Ambassador’s widow, if not actually a Highness) and I\ncontinued to descant on her beauty, her splendour, her nobility, until the\nday on which I mentioned that, by what I had heard Gilberte call her, she\nappeared to be a Mme. Blatin.",
        "“Oh, now I know whom you mean,” cried my mother, while I felt myself grow\nred all over with shame. “On guard! on guard!–as your grandfather says.\nAnd so it’s she that you think so wonderful? Why, she’s perfectly\nhorrible, and always has been. She’s the widow of a bailiff. You can’t\nremember, when you were little, all the trouble I used to have to avoid\nher at your gymnastic lessons, where she was always trying to get hold of\nme–I didn’t know the woman, of course–to tell me that you were ’much too\nnice-looking for a boy.’ She has always had an insane desire to get to\nknow people, and she must be quite insane, as I have always thought, if\nshe really does know Mme. Swann. For even if she does come of very common\npeople, I have never heard anything said against her character. But she\nmust always be forcing herself upon strangers. She is, really, a horrible\nwoman, frightfully vulgar, and besides, she is always creating awkward\nsituations.”",
        "As for Swann, in my attempts to resemble him, I spent the whole time, when\nI was at table, in drawing my finger along my nose and in rubbing my eyes.\nMy father would exclaim: “The child’s a perfect idiot, he’s becoming quite\nimpossible.” More than all else I should have liked to be as bald as\nSwann. He appeared to me to be a creature so extraordinary that I found it\nimpossible to believe that people whom I knew and often saw knew him also,\nand that in the course of the day anyone might run against him. And once\nmy mother, while she was telling us, as she did every evening at dinner,\nwhere she had been and what she had done that afternoon, merely by the\nwords: “By the way, guess whom I saw at the Trois Quartiers–at the\numbrella counter–Swann!” caused to burst open in the midst of her\nnarrative (an arid desert to me) a mystic blossom. What a melancholy\nsatisfaction to learn that, that very afternoon, threading through the\ncrowd his supernatural form, Swann had gone to buy an umbrella.  Among the\nevents of the day, great and small, but all equally unimportant, that one\nalone aroused in me those peculiar vibrations by which my love for\nGilberte was invariably stirred. My father complained that I took no\ninterest in anything, because I did not listen while he was speaking of\nthe political developments that might follow the visit of King\nTheo-dosius, at that moment in France as the nation’s guest and (it was\nhinted) ally. And yet how intensely interested I was to know whether Swann\nhad been wearing his hooded cape!",
        "“Did you speak to him?” I asked.",
        "“Why, of course I did,” answered my mother, who always seemed afraid lest,\nwere she to admit that we were not on the warmest of terms with Swann,\npeople would seek to reconcile us more than she cared for, in view of the\nexistence of Mme. Swann, whom she did not wish to know. “It was he who\ncame up and spoke to me. I hadn’t seen him.”",
        "“Then you haven’t quarrelled?”",
        "“Quarrelled? What on earth made you think that we had quarrelled?” she\nbriskly parried, as though I had cast doubt on the fiction of her friendly\nrelations with Swann, and was planning an attempt to ’bring them\ntogether.’",
        "“He might be cross with you for never asking him here.”",
        "“One isn’t obliged to ask everyone to one’s house, you know; has he ever\nasked me to his? I don’t know his wife.”",
        "“But he used often to come, at Combray.”",
        "“I should think he did! He used to come at Combray, and now, in Paris, he\nhas something better to do, and so have I. But I can promise you, we\ndidn’t look in the least like people who had quarrelled. We were kept\nwaiting there for some time, while they brought him his parcel. He asked\nafter you; he told me you had been playing with his daughter–” my mother\nwent on, amazing me with the portentous revelation of my own existence in\nSwann’s mind; far more than that, of my existence in so complete, so\nmaterial a form that when I stood before him, trembling with love, in the\nChamps-Elysées, he had known my name, and who my mother was, and had been\nable to blend with my quality as his daughter’s playmate certain facts\nwith regard to my grandparents and their connections, the place in which\nwe lived, certain details of our past life, all of which I myself perhaps\ndid not know. But my mother did not seem to have noticed anything\nparticularly attractive in that counter at the Trois Quartiers where she\nhad represented to Swann, at the moment in which he caught sight of her, a\ndefinite person with whom he had sufficient memories in common to impel\nhim to come up to her and to speak.",
        "Nor did either she or my father seem to find any occasion now to mention\nSwann’s family, the grandparents of Gilberte, nor to use the title of\nstockbroker, topics than which nothing else gave me so keen a pleasure.\nMy imagination had isolated and consecrated in the social Paris a certain\nfamily, just as it had set apart in the structural Paris a certain house,\non whose porch it had fashioned sculptures and made its windows precious.\nBut these ornaments I alone had eyes to see. Just as my father and mother\nlooked upon the house in which Swann lived as one that closely resembled\nthe other houses built at the same period in the neighbourhood of the\nBois, so Swann’s family seemed to them to be in the same category as many\nother families of stockbrokers. Their judgment was more or less favourable\naccording to the extent to which the family in question shared in merits\nthat were common to the rest of the universe, and there was about it\nnothing that they could call unique. What, on the other hand, they did\nappreciate in the Swanns they found in equal, if not in greater measure\nelsewhere.  And so, after admitting that the house was in a good position,\nthey would go on to speak of some other house that was in a better, but\nhad nothing to do with Gilberte, or of financiers on a larger scale than\nher grandfather had been; and if they had appeared, for a moment, to be of\nmy opinion, that was a mistake which was very soon corrected. For in order\nto distinguish in all Gilberte’s surroundings an indefinable quality\nanalogous, in the scale of emotions, to what in the scale of colours is\ncalled infra-red, a supplementary sense of perception was required, with\nwhich love, for the time being, had endowed me; and this my parents\nlacked.",
        "On the days when Gilberte had warned me that she would not be coming to\nthe Champs-Elysées, I would try to arrange my walks so that I should be\nbrought into some kind of contact with her. Sometimes I would lead\nFrançoise on a pilgrimage to the house in which the Swanns lived, making\nher repeat to me unendingly all that she had learned from the governess\nwith regard to Mme. Swann. “It seems, she puts great faith in medals. She\nwould never think of starting on a journey if she had heard an owl hoot,\nor the death-watch in the wall, or if she had seen a cat at midnight, or\nif the furniture had creaked. Oh yes! she’s a most religious lady, she\nis!” I was so madly in love with Gilberte that if, on our way, I caught\nsight of their old butler taking the dog out, my emotion would bring me to\na standstill, I would fasten on his white whiskers eyes that melted with\npassion. And Françoise would rouse me with: “What’s wrong with you now,\nchild?” and we would continue on our way until we reached their gate,\nwhere a porter, different from every other porter in the world, and\nsaturated, even to the braid on his livery, with the same melancholy charm\nthat I had felt to be latent in the name of Gilberte, looked at me as\nthough he knew that I was one of those whose natural unworthiness would\nfor ever prevent them from penetrating into the mysteries of the life\ninside, which it was his duty to guard, and over which the ground-floor\nwindows appeared conscious of being protectingly closed, with far less\nresemblance, between the nobly sweeping arches of their muslin curtains,\nto any other windows in the world than to Gilberte’s glancing eyes. On\nother days we would go along the boulevards, and I would post myself at\nthe corner of the Rue Duphot; I had heard that Swann was often to be seen\npassing there, on his way to the dentist’s; and my imagination so far\ndifferentiated Gilberte’s father from the rest of humanity, his presence\nin the midst of a crowd of real people introduced among them so miraculous\nan element, that even before we reached the Madeleine I would be trembling\nwith emotion at the thought that I was approaching a street from which\nthat supernatural apparition might at any moment burst upon me unawares.",
        "But most often of all, on days when I was not to see Gilberte, as I had\nheard that Mme. Swann walked almost every day along the Allée des Acacias,\nround the big lake, and in the Allée de la Reine Marguerite, I would guide\nFrançoise in the direction of the Bois de Boulogne. It was to me like one\nof those zoological gardens in which one sees assembled together a variety\nof flora, and contrasted effects in landscape; where from a hill one\npasses to a grotto, a meadow, rocks, a stream, a trench, another hill, a\nmarsh, but knows that they are there only to enable the hippopotamus,\nzebra, crocodile, rabbit, bear and heron to disport themselves in a\nnatural or a picturesque setting; this, the Bois, equally complex, uniting\na multitude of little worlds, distinct and separate–placing a stage set\nwith red trees, American oaks, like an experimental forest in Virginia,\nnext to a fir-wood by the edge of the lake, or to a forest grove from\nwhich would suddenly emerge, in her lissom covering of furs, with the\nlarge, appealing eyes of a dumb animal, a hastening walker–was the Garden\nof Woman; and like the myrtle-alley in the Aeneid, planted for their\ndelight with trees of one kind only, the Allée des Acacias was thronged by\nthe famous Beauties of the day. As, from a long way off, the sight of the\njutting crag from which it dives into the pool thrills with joy the\nchildren who know that they are going to behold the seal, long before I\nreached the acacia-alley, their fragrance, scattered abroad, would make me\nfeel that I was approaching the incomparable presence of a vegetable\npersonality, strong and tender; then, as I drew near, the sight of their\ntopmost branches, their lightly tossing foliage, in its easy grace, its\ncoquettish outline, its delicate fabric, over which hundreds of flowers\nwere laid, like winged and throbbing colonies of precious insects; and\nfinally their name itself, feminine, indolent and seductive, made my heart\nbeat, but with a social longing, like those waltzes which remind us only\nof the names of the fair dancers, called aloud as they entered the\nball-room. I had been told that I should see in the alley certain women of\nfashion, who, in spite of their not all having husbands, were constantly\nmentioned in conjunction with Mme. Swann, but most often by their\nprofessional names;–their new names, when they had any, being but a sort\nof incognito, a veil which those who would speak of them were careful to\ndraw aside, so as to make themselves understood. Thinking that Beauty–in\nthe order of feminine elegance–was governed by occult laws into the\nknowledge of which they had been initiated, and that they had the power to\nrealise it, I accepted before seeing them, like the truth of a coming\nrevelation, the appearance of their clothes, of their carriages and\nhorses, of a thousand details among which I placed my faith as in an inner\nsoul which gave the cohesion of a work of art to that ephemeral and\nchanging pageant. But it was Mme. Swann whom I wished to see, and I waited\nfor her to go past, as deeply moved as though she were Gilberte, whose\nparents, saturated, like everything in her environment, with her own\nspecial charm, excited in me as keen a passion as she did herself, indeed\na still more painful disturbance (since their point of contact with her\nwas that intimate, that internal part of her life which was hidden from\nme), and furthermore, for I very soon learned, as we shall see in due\ncourse, that they did not like my playing with her, that feeling of\nveneration which we always have for those who hold, and exercise without\nrestraint, the power to do us an injury.",
        "I assigned the first place, in the order of aesthetic merit and of social\ngrandeur, to simplicity, when I saw Mme. Swann on foot, in a ’polonaise’\nof plain cloth, a little toque on her head trimmed with a pheasant’s wing,\na bunch of violets in her bosom, hastening along the Allée des Acacias as\nif it had been merely the shortest way back to her own house, and\nacknowledging with a rapid glance the courtesy of the gentlemen in\ncarriages, who, recognising her figure at a distance, were raising their\nhats to her and saying to one another that there was never anyone so well\nturned out as she. But instead of simplicity it was to ostentation that I\nmust assign the first place if, after I had compelled Françoise, who could\nhold out no longer, and complained that her legs were ’giving’ beneath\nher, to stroll up and down with me for another hour, I saw at length,\nemerging from the Porte Dauphine, figuring for me a royal dignity, the\npassage of a sovereign, an impression such as no real Queen has ever since\nbeen able to give me, because my notion of their power has been less\nvague, and more founded upon experience–borne along by the flight of a\npair of fiery horses, slender and shapely as one sees them in the drawings\nof Constantin Guys, carrying on its box an enormous coachman, furred like\na cossack, and by his side a diminutive groom, like Toby, “the late\nBeaudenord’s tiger,” I saw–or rather I felt its outlines engraved upon my\nheart by a clean and killing stab–a matchless victoria, built rather\nhigh, and hinting, through the extreme modernity of its appointments, at\nthe forms of an earlier day, deep down in which lay negligently back Mme.\nSwann, her hair, now quite pale with one grey lock, girt with a narrow\nband of flowers, usually violets, from which floated down long veils, a\nlilac parasol in her hand, on her lips an ambiguous smile in which I read\nonly the benign condescension of Majesty, though it was pre-eminently the\nenticing smile of the courtesan, which she graciously bestowed upon the\nmen who bowed to her. That smile was, in reality, saying to one: “Oh yes,\nI do remember, quite well; it was wonderful!” to another: “How I should\nhave loved to! We were unfortunate!”, to a third: “Yes, if you like! I\nmust just keep in the line for a minute, then as soon as I can I will\nbreak away.” When strangers passed she still allowed to linger about her\nlips a lazy smile, as though she expected or remembered some friend, which\nmade them say: “What a lovely woman!”. And for certain men only she had a\nsour, strained, shy, cold smile which meant: “Yes, you old goat, I know\nthat you’ve got a tongue like a viper, that you can’t keep quiet for a\nmoment. But do you suppose that I care what you say?” Coquelin passed,\ntalking, in a group of listening friends, and with a sweeping wave of his\nhand bade a theatrical good day to the people in the carriages. But I\nthought only of Mme. Swann, and pretended to have not yet seen her, for I\nknew that, when she reached the pigeon-shooting ground, she would tell her\ncoachman to ’break away’ and to stop the carriage, so that she might come\nback on foot. And on days when I felt that I had the courage to pass close\nby her I would drag Françoise off in that direction; until the moment came\nwhen I saw Mme. Swann, letting trail behind her the long train of her\nlilac skirt, dressed, as the populace imagine queens to be dressed, in\nrich attire such as no other woman might wear, lowering her eyes now and\nthen to study the handle of her parasol, paying scant attention to the\npassers-by, as though the important thing for her, her one object in being\nthere, was to take exercise, without thinking that she was seen, and that\nevery head was turned towards her. Sometimes, however, when she had looked\nback to call her dog to her, she would cast, almost imperceptibly, a\nsweeping glance round about.",
        "Those even who did not know her were warned by something exceptional,\nsomething beyond the normal in her–or perhaps by a telepathic suggestion\nsuch as would move an ignorant audience to a frenzy of applause when Berma\nwas ’sublime’–that she must be some one well-known. They would ask one\nanother, “Who is she?”, or sometimes would interrogate a passing stranger,\nor would make a mental note of how she was dressed so as to fix her\nidentity, later, in the mind of a friend better informed than themselves,\nwho would at once enlighten them. Another pair, half-stopping in their\nwalk, would exchange:",
        "“You know who that is? Mme. Swann! That conveys nothing to you?  Odette de\nCrécy, then?”",
        "“Odette de Crécy! Why, I thought as much. Those great, sad eyes...  But I\nsay, you know, she can’t be as young as she was once, eh? I remember, I\nhad her on the day that MacMahon went.”",
        "“I shouldn’t remind her of it, if I were you. She is now Mme. Swann, the\nwife of a gentleman in the Jockey Club, a friend of the Prince of Wales.\nApart from that, though, she is wonderful still.”",
        "“Oh, but you ought to have known her then; Gad, she was lovely! She lived\nin a very odd little house with a lot of Chinese stuff. I remember, we\nwere bothered all the time by the newsboys, shouting outside; in the end\nshe made me get up and go.”",
        "Without listening to these memories, I could feel all about her the\nindistinct murmur of fame. My heart leaped with impatience when I thought\nthat a few seconds must still elapse before all these people, among whom I\nwas dismayed not to find a certain mulatto banker who (or so I felt) had a\ncontempt for me, were to see the unknown youth, to whom they had not, so\nfar, been paying the slightest attention, salute (without knowing her, it\nwas true, but I thought that I had sufficient authority since my parents\nknew her husband and I was her daughter’s playmate) this woman whose\nreputation for beauty, for misconduct, and for elegance was universal.\nBut I was now close to Mme. Swann; I pulled off my hat with so lavish, so\nprolonged a gesture that she could not repress a smile. People laughed. As\nfor her, she had never seen me with Gilberte, she did not know my name,\nbut I was for her–like one of the keepers in the Bois, like the boatman,\nor the ducks on the lake, to which she threw scraps of bread–one of the\nminor personages, familiar, nameless, as devoid of individual character as\na stage-hand in a theatre, of her daily walks abroad.",
        "On certain days when I had missed her in the Allée des Acacias I would be\nso fortunate as to meet her in the Allée de la Reine Marguerite, where\nwomen went who wished to be alone, or to appear to be wishing to be alone;\nshe would not be alone for long, being soon overtaken by some man or\nother, often in a grey ’tile’ hat, whom I did not know, and who would talk\nto her for some time, while their two carriages crawled behind.",
        "That sense of the complexity of the Bois de Boulogne which made it an\nartificial place and, in the zoological or mythological sense of the word,\na Garden, I captured again, this year, as I crossed it on my way to\nTrianon, on one of those mornings, early in November, when in Paris, if we\nstay indoors, being so near and yet prevented from witnessing the\ntransformation scene of autumn, which is drawing so rapidly to a close\nwithout our assistance, we feel a regret for the fallen leaves that\nbecomes a fever, and may even keep us awake at night. Into my closed room\nthey had been drifting already for a month, summoned there by my desire to\nsee them, slipping between my thoughts and the object, whatever it might\nbe, upon which I was trying to concentrate them, whirling in front of me\nlike those brown spots that sometimes, whatever we may be looking at, will\nseem to be dancing or swimming before our eyes. And on that morning, not\nhearing the splash of the rain as on the previous days, seeing the smile\nof fine weather at the corners of my drawn curtains, as from the corners\nof closed lips may escape the secret of their happiness, I had felt that I\ncould actually see those yellow leaves, with the light shining through\nthem, in their supreme beauty; and being no more able to restrain myself\nfrom going to look at the trees than, in my childhood’s days, when the\nwind howled in the chimney, I had been able to resist the longing to visit\nthe sea, I had risen and left the house to go to Trianon, passing through\nthe Bois de Boulogne.  It was the hour and the season in which the Bois\nseems, perhaps, most multiform, not only because it is then most divided,\nbut because it is divided in a different way. Even in the unwooded parts,\nwhere the horizon is large, here and there against the background of a\ndark and distant mass of trees, now leafless or still keeping their summer\nfoliage unchanged, a double row of orange-red chestnuts seemed, as in a\npicture just begun, to be the only thing painted, so far, by an artist who\nhad not yet laid any colour on the rest, and to be offering their\ncloister, in full daylight, for the casual exercise of the human figures\nthat would be added to the picture later on.",
        "Farther off, at a place where the trees were still all green, one alone,\nsmall, stunted, lopped, but stubborn in its resistance, was tossing in the\nbreeze an ugly mane of red. Elsewhere, again, might be seen the first\nawakening of this Maytime of the leaves, and those of an ampelopsis, a\nsmiling miracle, like a red hawthorn flowering in winter, had that very\nmorning all ’come out,’ so to speak, in blossom. And the Bois had the\ntemporary, unfinished, artificial look of a nursery garden or a park in\nwhich, either for some botanic purpose or in preparation for a festival,\nthere have been embedded among the trees of commoner growth, which have\nnot yet been uprooted and transplanted elsewhere, a few rare specimens,\nwith fantastic foliage, which seem to be clearing all round themselves an\nempty space, making room, giving air, diffusing light. Thus it was the\ntime of year at which the Bois de Boulogne displays more separate\ncharacteristics, assembles more distinct elements in a composite whole\nthan at any other.  It was also the time of day. In places where the trees\nstill kept their leaves, they seemed to have undergone an alteration of\ntheir substance from the point at which they were touched by the sun’s\nlight, still, at this hour in the morning, almost horizontal, as it would\nbe again, a few hours later, at the moment when, just as dusk began, it\nwould flame up like a lamp, project afar over the leaves a warm and\nartificial glow, and set ablaze the few topmost boughs of a tree that\nwould itself remain unchanged, a sombre incombustible candelabrum beneath\nits flaming crest.  At one spot the light grew solid as a brick wall, and\nlike a piece of yellow Persian masonry, patterned in blue, daubed coarsely\nupon the sky the leaves of the chestnuts; at another, it cut them off from\nthe sky towards which they stretched out their curling, golden fingers.\nHalf-way up the trunk of a tree draped with wild vine, the light had\ngrafted and brought to blossom, too dazzling to be clearly distinguished,\nan enormous posy, of red flowers apparently, perhaps of a new variety of\ncarnation.  The different parts of the Bois, so easily confounded in\nsummer in the density and monotony of their universal green, were now\nclearly divided. A patch of brightness indicated the approach to almost\nevery one of them, or else a splendid mass of foliage stood out before it\nlike an oriflamme. I could make out, as on a coloured map, Armenonville,\nthe Pré Catalan, Madrid, the Race Course and the shore of the lake. Here\nand there would appear some meaningless erection, a sham grotto, a mill,\nfor which the trees made room by drawing away from it, or which was borne\nupon the soft green platform of a grassy lawn.  I could feel that the Bois\nwas not really a wood, that it existed for a purpose alien to the life of\nits trees; my sense of exaltation was due not only to admiration of the\nautumn tints but to a bodily desire. Ample source of a joy which the heart\nfeels at first without being conscious of its cause, without understanding\nthat it results from no external impulse! Thus I gazed at the trees with\nan unsatisfied longing which went beyond them and, without my knowledge,\ndirected itself towards that masterpiece of beautiful strolling women\nwhich the trees enframed for a few hours every day. I walked towards the\nAllée des Acacias. I passed through forest groves in which the morning\nlight, breaking them into new sections, lopped and trimmed the trees,\nunited different trunks in marriage, made nosegays of their branches. It\nwould skilfully draw towards it a pair of trees; making deft use of the\nsharp chisel of light and shade, it would cut away from each of them half\nof its trunk and branches, and, weaving together the two halves that\nremained, would make of them either a single pillar of shade, defined by\nthe surrounding light, or a single luminous phantom whose artificial,\nquivering contour was encompassed in a network of inky shadows.  When a\nray of sunshine gilded the highest branches, they seemed, soaked and still\ndripping with a sparkling moisture, to have emerged alone from the liquid,\nemerald-green atmosphere in which the whole grove was plunged as though\nbeneath the sea. For the trees continued to live by their own vitality,\nand when they had no longer any leaves, that vitality gleamed more\nbrightly still from the nap of green velvet that carpeted their trunks, or\nin the white enamel of the globes of mistletoe that were scattered all the\nway up to the topmost branches of the poplars, rounded as are the sun and\nmoon in Michelangelo’s ’Creation.’ But, forced for so many years now, by a\nsort of grafting process, to share the life of feminine humanity, they\ncalled to my mind the figure of the dryad, the fair worldling, swiftly\nwalking, brightly coloured, whom they sheltered with their branches as\nshe passed beneath them, and obliged to acknowledge, as they themselves\nacknowledged, the power of the season; they recalled to me the happy days\nwhen I was young and had faith, when I would hasten eagerly to the spots\nwhere masterpieces of female elegance would be incarnate for a few moments\nbeneath the unconscious, accommodating boughs. But the beauty for which\nthe firs and acacias of the Bois de Boulogne made me long, more\ndisquieting in that respect than the chestnuts and lilacs of Trianon which\nI was going to see, was not fixed somewhere outside myself in the relics\nof an historical period, in works of art, in a little temple of love at\nwhose door was piled an oblation of autumn leaves ribbed with gold. I\nreached the shore of the lake; I walked on as far as the pigeon-shooting\nground.  The idea of perfection which I had within me I had bestowed, in\nthat other time, upon the height of a victoria, upon the raking thinness\nof those horses, frenzied and light as wasps upon the wing, with bloodshot\neyes like the cruel steeds of Diomed, which now, smitten by a desire to\nsea again what I had once loved, as ardent as the desire that had driven\nme, many years before, along the same paths, I wished to see renewed\nbefore my eyes at the moment when Mme. Swann’s enormous coachman,\nsupervised by a groom no bigger than his fist, and as infantile as Saint\nGeorge in the picture, endeavoured to curb the ardour of the flying,\nsteel-tipped pinions with which they thundered along the ground. Alas!\nthere was nothing now but motor-cars driven each by a moustached mechanic,\nwith a tall footman towering by his side. I wished to hold before my\nbodily eyes, that I might know whether they were indeed as charming as\nthey appeared to the eyes of memory, little hats, so low-crowned as to\nseem no more than garlands about the brows of women. All the hats now were\nimmense; covered with fruits and flowers and all manner of birds. In place\nof the lovely gowns in which Mme. Swann walked like a Queen, appeared\nGreco-Saxon tunics, with Tanagra folds, or sometimes, in the Directoire\nstyle, ’Liberty chiffons’ sprinkled with flowers like sheets of wallpaper.\nOn the heads of the gentlemen who might have been eligible to stroll with\nMme. Swann in the Allée de la Reine Marguerite, I found not the grey\n’tile’ hats of old, nor any other kind. They walked the Bois bare-headed.\nAnd seeing all these new elements of the spectacle, I had no longer the\nfaith which, applied to them, would have given them consistency, unity,\nlife; they passed in a scattered sequence before me, at random, without\nreality, containing in themselves no beauty that my eyes might have\nendeavoured as in the old days, to extract from them and to compose in a\npicture. They were just women, in whose elegance I had no belief, and\nwhose clothes seemed to me unimportant. But when a belief vanishes, there\nsurvives it–more and more ardently, so as to cloak the absence of the\npower, now lost to us, of imparting reality to new phenomena–an\nidolatrous attachment to the old things which our belief in them did once\nanimate, as if it was in that belief and not in ourselves that the divine\nspark resided, and as if our present incredulity had a contingent\ncause–the death of the gods.",
        "“Oh, horrible!” I exclaimed to myself: “Does anyone really imagine that\nthese motor-cars are as smart as the old carriage-and-pair? I dare say.  I\nam too old now–but I was not intended for a world in which women shackle\nthemselves in garments that are not even made of cloth. To what purpose\nshall I walk among these trees if there is nothing left now of the\nassembly that used to meet beneath the delicate tracery of reddening\nleaves, if vulgarity and fatuity have supplanted the exquisite thing that\nonce their branches framed? Oh, horrible! My consolation is to think of\nthe women whom I have known, in the past, now that there is no standard\nleft of elegance. But how can the people who watch these dreadful\ncreatures hobble by, beneath hats on which have been heaped the spoils of\naviary or garden-bed,–how can they imagine the charm that there was in\nthe sight of Mme. Swann, crowned with a close-fitting lilac bonnet, or\nwith a tiny hat from which rose stiffly above her head a single\niris?” Could I ever have made them understand the emotion that I used to\nfeel on winter mornings, when I met Mme. Swann on foot, in an otter-skin\ncoat, with a woollen cap from which stuck out two blade-like\npartridge-feathers, but enveloped also in the deliberate, artificial\nwarmth of her own house, which was suggested by nothing more than the\nbunch of violets crushed into her bosom, whose flowering, vivid and blue\nagainst the grey sky, the freezing air, the naked boughs, had the same\ncharming effect of using the season and the weather merely as a setting,\nand of living actually in a human atmosphere, in the atmosphere of this\nwoman, as had in the vases and beaupots of her drawing-room, beside the\nblazing fire, in front of the silk-covered sofa, the flowers that looked\nout through closed windows at the falling snow? But it would not have\nsufficed me that the costumes alone should still have been the same as in\nthose distant years.  Because of the solidarity that binds together the\ndifferent parts of a general impression, parts that our memory keeps in a\nbalanced whole, of which we are not permitted to subtract or to decline\nany fraction, I should have liked to be able to pass the rest of the day\nwith one of those women, over a cup of tea, in a little house with\ndark-painted walls (as Mme.  Swann’s were still in the year after that in\nwhich the first part of this story ends) against which would glow the\norange flame, the red combustion, the pink and white flickering of her\nchrysanthemums in the twilight of a November evening, in moments similar\nto those in which (as we shall see) I had not managed to discover the\npleasures for which I longed. But now, albeit they had led to nothing,\nthose moments struck me as having been charming enough in themselves. I\nsought to find them again as I remembered them. Alas! there was nothing\nnow but flats decorated in the Louis XVI style, all white paint, with\nhortensias in blue enamel. Moreover, people did not return to Paris, now,\nuntil much later. Mme. Swann would have written to me, from a country\nhouse, that she would not be in town before February, had I asked her to\nreconstruct for me the elements of that memory which I felt to belong to a\ndistant era, to a date in time towards which it was forbidden me to ascend\nagain the fatal slope, the elements of that longing which had become,\nitself, as inaccessible as the pleasure that it had once vainly pursued.\nAnd I should have required also that they be the same women, those whose\ncostume interested me because, at a time when I still had faith, my\nimagination had individualised them and had provided each of them with a\nlegend. Alas! in the acacia-avenue–the myrtle-alley–I did see some of\nthem again, grown old, no more now than grim spectres of what once they\nhad been, wandering to and fro, in desperate search of heaven knew what,\nthrough the Virgilian groves. They had long fled, and still I stood vainly\nquestioning the deserted paths. The sun’s face was hidden.  Nature began\nagain to reign over the Bois, from which had vanished all trace of the\nidea that it was the Elysian Garden of Woman; above the gimcrack windmill\nthe real sky was grey; the wind wrinkled the surface of the Grand Lac in\nlittle wavelets, like a real lake; large birds passed swiftly over the\nBois, as over a real wood, and with shrill cries perched, one after\nanother, on the great oaks which, beneath their Druidical crown, and with\nDodonaic majesty, seemed to proclaim the unpeopled vacancy of this\nestranged forest, and helped me to understand how paradoxical it is to\nseek in reality for the pictures that are stored in one’s memory, which\nmust inevitably lose the charm that comes to them from memory itself and\nfrom their not being apprehended by the senses. The reality that I had\nknown no longer existed. It sufficed that Mme. Swann did not appear, in\nthe same attire and at the same moment, for the whole avenue to be\naltered. The places that we have known belong now only to the little world\nof space on which we map them for our own convenience. None of them was\never more than a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that\ncomposed our life at that time; remembrance of a particular form is but\nregret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as\nfugitive, alas, as the years.",
