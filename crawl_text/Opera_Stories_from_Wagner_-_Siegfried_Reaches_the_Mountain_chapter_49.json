        "A heavy storm arose as Siegfried and the bird neared the foot of the\nmountain where Brunhilde slept. There were peals of deep thunder.",
        "The sky grew very dark. The great boughs of the trees swayed with the\nwind.",
        "Siegfried took shelter under a low spreading fir.",
        "The storm did not last long, and as the light again broke through the\nclouds, Siegfried looked about for his little guide, but all in vain.\nThe bird had fled.",
        "Siegfried started on up the mountain, when suddenly the giant Wotan\nstood before him.",
        "“What are you doing here?” demanded Wotan.",
        "Siegfried replied:–",
        "“I am going to the top of this mountain. There a maiden lies sleeping. I\nwill awaken her, and she shall be my bride.”",
        "“Go back to your forest!” commanded Wotan. “This mountain is encircled\nby fire.”",
        "And stretching forth his arm, he barred the path with his mighty spear.",
        "Siegfried quickly drew his sword from its sheath.",
        "“This is the magic spear that rules the world!” said Wotan. “Put away\nthat sword, or the spear that once shattered it will shatter it again!”",
        "“Ha!” cried Siegfried, “then you were my father’s foe!”",
        "There was a flash of Siegfried’s blade, then a crash that echoed over\nmountains and valleys, and Siegfried had shattered Wotan’s spear. It lay\nin splinters on the ground.",
        "Wotan stepped aside and sadly bowed his head upon his breast.",
        "He knew this meant the downfall of the giants. No longer would the earth\nbe ruled from fair Valhalla’s heights.",
