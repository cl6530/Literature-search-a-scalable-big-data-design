        "These twenty-five short chapters on Jewish Literature open with the fall\nof Jerusalem in the year 70 of the current era, and end with the death\nof Moses Mendelssohn in 1786. Thus the period covered extends over more\nthan seventeen centuries. Yet, long as this period is, it is too brief.\nTo do justice to the literature of Judaism even in outline, it is\nclearly necessary to include the Bible, the Apocrypha, and the writings\nof Alexandrian Jews, such as Philo. Only by such an inclusion can the\ngenius of the Hebrew people be traced from its early manifestations\nthrough its inspired prime to its brilliant after-glow in the centuries\nwith which this little volume deals.",
        "One special reason has induced me to limit this book to the scope\nindicated above. The Bible has been treated in England and America in a\nvariety of excellent text-books written by and for Jews and Jewesses. It\nseemed to me very doubtful whether the time is, or ever will be, ripe\nfor dealing with the Scriptures from the purely literary stand-point in\nteaching young students. But this is the stand-point of this volume.\nThus I have refrained from including the Bible, because, on the one\nhand, I felt that I could not deal with it as I have tried to deal with\nthe rest of Hebrew literature, and because, on the other hand, there was\nno necessity for me to attempt to add to the books already in use. The\nsections to which I have restricted myself are only rarely taught to\nyoung students in a consecutive manner, except in so far as they fall\nwithin the range of lessons on Jewish History. It was strongly urged on\nme by a friend of great experience and knowledge, that a small text-book\non later Jewish Literature was likely to be found useful both for home\nand school use. Such a book might encourage the elementary study of\nJewish literature in a wider circle than has hitherto been reached.\nHence this book has been compiled with the definite aim of providing an\nelementary manual. It will be seen that both in the inclusions and\nexclusions the author has followed a line of his own, but he lays no\nclaim to originality. The book is simply designed as a manual for those\nwho may wish to master some of the leading characteristics of the\nsubject, without burdening themselves with too many details and dates.",
        "This consideration has in part determined also the method of the book.\nIn presenting an outline of Jewish literature three plans are possible.\nOne can divide the subject according to Periods. Starting with the\nRabbinic Age and closing with the activity of the earlier Gaonim, or\nPersian Rabbis, the First Period would carry us to the eighth or the\nninth century. A well-marked Second Period is that of the Arabic-Spanish\nwriters, a period which would extend from the ninth to the fifteenth\ncentury. From the sixteenth to the eighteenth century forms a Third\nPeriod with distinct characteristics. Finally, the career of Mendelssohn\nmarks the definite beginning of the Modern Period. Such a grouping of\nthe facts presents many advantages, but it somewhat obscures the varying\nconditions prevalent at one and the same time in different countries\nwhere the Jews were settled. Hence some writers have preferred to\narrange the material under the different untries. It is quite\npossible to draw a map of the world’s civilization by merely marking the\nsuccessive places in which Jewish literature has fixed its\nhead-quarters. But, on the other hand, such a method of classification\nhas the disadvantage that it leads to much overlapping. For long\nintervals together, it is impossible to separate Italy from Spain,\nFrance from Germany, Persia from Egypt, Constantinople from Amsterdam.\nThis has induced other writers to propose a third method and to trace\nInfluences, to indicate that, whereas Rabbinism may be termed the\nnative product of the Jewish genius, the scientific, poetical, and\nphilosophical tendencies of Jewish writers in the Middle Ages were due\nto the interaction of external and internal forces. Further, in this\narrangement, the Ghetto period would have a place assigned to it as\nsuch, for it would again mark the almost complete sway of purely Jewish\nforces in Jewish literature. Adopting this classification, we should\nhave a wave of Jewish impulse, swollen by the accretion of foreign\nwaters, once more breaking on a Jewish strand, with its contents in\nsomething like the same condition in which they left the original\nspring. All these three methods are true, and this has impelled me to\nrefuse to follow any one of them to the exclusion of the other two. I\nhave tried to trace influences, to observe periods, to distinguish\ncountries. I have also tried to derive color and vividness by\nselecting prominent personalities round which to group whole cycles of\nfacts. Thus, some of the chapters bear the names of famous men, others\nare entitled from periods, others from countries, and yet others are\nnamed from the general currents of European thought. In all this my aim\nhas been very modest. I have done little in the way of literary\ncriticism, but I felt that a dry collection of names and dates was the\nvery thing I had to avoid. I need not say that I have done my best to\nensure accuracy in my statements by referring to the best authorities\nknown to me on each division of the subject. To name the works to which\nI am indebted would need a list of many of the best-known products of\nrecent Continental and American scholarship. At the end of every\nchapter I have, however, given references to some English works and\nessays. Graetz is cited in the English translation published by the\nJewish Publication Society of America. The figures in brackets refer to\nthe edition published in London. The American and the English editions\nof S. Schechter’s “Studies in Judaism” are similarly referred to.",
        "Of one thing I am confident. No presentation of the facts, however bald\nand inadequate it be, can obscure the truth that this little book deals\nwith a great and an inspiring literature. It is possible to question\nwhether the books of great Jews always belonged to the great books of\nthe world. There may have been, and there were, greater legalists than\nRashi, greater poets than Jehuda Halevi, greater philosophers than\nMaimonides, greater moralists than Bachya. But there has been no greater\nliterature than that which these and numerous other Jews represent.",
        "Rabbinism was a sequel to the Bible, and if like all sequels it was\nunequal to its original, it nevertheless shared its greatness. The works\nof all Jews up to the modern period were the sequel to this sequel.\nThrough them all may be detected the unifying principle that literature\nin its truest sense includes life itself; that intellect is the handmaid\nto conscience; and that the best books are those which best teach men\nhow to live. This underlying unity gave more harmony to Jewish\nliterature than is possessed by many literatures more distinctively\nnational. The maxim, “Righteousness delivers from death,” applies to\nbooks as well as to men. A literature whose consistent theme is\nRighteousness is immortal. On the very day on which Jerusalem fell, this\ntheory of the interconnection between literature and life became the\nfixed principle of Jewish thought, and it ceased to hold undisputed sway\nonly in the age of Mendelssohn. It was in the “Vineyard” of Jamnia that\nthe theory received its firm foundation. A starting-point for this\nvolume will therefore be sought in the meeting-place in which the\nRabbis, exiled from the Holy City, found a new fatherland in the Book of\nbooks.",
