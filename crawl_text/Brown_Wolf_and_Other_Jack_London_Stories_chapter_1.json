        "Boys delight in men who have had adventures, and when they are\nprivileged to read of such exploits in thrilling story form, that is the\n“seventh heaven” for them. Such a “boys’ man” was Jack London, whose\nwhole life was one of stirring action on land and sea. Gifted as a story\nteller, he wrote books almost without end. Some of them, “The Call of\nthe Wild,” “The Sea Wolf” and “White Fang,” have already been recognized\nas fine books for boys. Others, volumes of short stories, contain many\nof like interest, possessing the same qualities that have made the other\nand longer stories so acceptable as juveniles.",
        "Effort has been made by the editor to bring together in one volume a\nnumber of such stories, not for the reason alone that there might be\nanother Jack London book for boys, but also in order to add to our\njuvenile literature a volume likely “to be chewed and digested,” as\nBacon says, a book worthy “to be read whole, and with diligence and\nattention.” For my belief is that boys read altogether too few of such\nbooks. Or perhaps it would be more correct to say, have too few\nopportunities to read such books, because so often we fail to see how\nquick in their reading their minds are to grasp the more difficult, and\nhow keen and competent their conscience to draw the right conclusion\nwhen situations are presented wherein men err so grievously.",
        "It is hoped the stories presented will serve to exercise both the boy’s\nmind and conscience; that seeing and feeling life and nature as Jack\nLondon saw and felt it–the best and the worst in human nature, with the\nInfinite always near and from whom there is no escape–seeing and\nfeeling such things boys will develop the emotional muscles of the\nspirit, have opened up new windows to their imaginations, and withal add\nsome line or color to their life’s ideals.",
