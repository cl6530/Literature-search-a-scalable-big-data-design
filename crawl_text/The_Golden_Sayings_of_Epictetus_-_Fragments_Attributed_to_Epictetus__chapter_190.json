        "A life entangled with Fortune is like a torrent. It is\nturbulent and muddy; hard to pass and masterful of mood: noisy\nand of brief continuance.",
        "The soul that companies with Virtue is like an ever-flowing\nsource. It is a pure, clear, and wholesome draught; sweet, rich,\nand generous of its store; that injures not, neither destroys.",
        "It is a shame that one who sweetens his drink with the gifts\nof the bee, should embitter God’s gift Reason with vice.",
        "Crows pick out the eyes of the dead, when the dead have no\nlonger need of them; but flatterers mar the soul of the living,\nand her eyes they blind.",
        "Keep neither a blunt knife nor an ill-disciplined looseness\nof tongue.",
        "Nature hath given men one tongue but two ears, that we may\nhear from others twice as much as we speak.",
        "Do not give sentence in another tribunal till you have been\nyourself judged in the tribunal of Justice.",
        "It is shameful for a Judge to be judged by others.",
        "Give me by all means the shorter and nobler life, instead of\none that is longer but of less account!",
        "Freedom is the name of virtue: Slavery, of vice. . . . None\nis a slave whose acts are free.",
        "Of pleasures, those which occur most rarely give the most\ndelight.",
        "Exceed due measure, and the most delightful things become\nthe least delightful.",
        "The anger of an ape—the threat of a flatterer:—these\ndeserve equal regard.",
        "Chastise thy passions that they avenge not themselves upon\nthee.",
        "No man is free who is not master of himself.",
        "A ship should not ride on a single anchor, nor life on a\nsingle hope.",
        "Fortify thyself with contentment: that is an impregnable\nstronghold.",
        "No man who is a lover of money, of pleasure, of glory, is\nlikewise a lover of Men; but only he that is a lover of\nwhatsoever things are fair and good.",
        "Think of God more often than thou breathest.",
        "Choose the life that is noblest, for custom can make it\nsweet to thee.",
        "Let thy speech of God be renewed day by day, aye, rather\nthan thy meat and drink.",
        "Even as the Sun doth not wait for prayers and incantations\nto rise, but shines forth and is welcomed by all: so thou also\nwait not for clapping of hands and shouts and praise to do thy\nduty; nay, do good of thine own accord, and thou wilt be loved\nlike the Sun.",
        "Let no man think that he is loved by any who loveth none.",
        "If thou rememberest that God standeth by to behold and visit\nall that thou doest; whether in the body or in the soul, thou\nsurely wilt not err in any prayer or deed; and thou shalt have\nGod to dwell with thee.",
        "Note.—Schweighaeuser’s great edition collects 181 fragments\nattributed to Epictetus, of which but a few are certainly\ngenuine. Some (as xxi., xxiv., above) bear the stamp of\nPythagorean origin; others, though changed in form, may well be\nbased upon Epictetean sayings. Most have been preserved in the\nAnthology of John of Stobi (Stobaeus), a Byzantine collector, of\nwhom scarcely anything is known but that he probably wrote\ntowards the end of the fifth century, and made his vast body of\nextracts from more than five hundred authors for his son’s use.\nThe best examination of the authenticity of the Fragments is\nQuaestiones Epicteteae, by R. Asmus, 1888. The above selection\nincludes some of doubtful origin but intrinsic interest.—Crossley.",
