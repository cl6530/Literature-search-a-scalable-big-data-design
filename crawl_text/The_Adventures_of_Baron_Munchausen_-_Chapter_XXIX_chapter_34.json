        "  The Baron’s retinue is opposed in a heroic style by Don Quixote,\n  who in his turn is attacked by Gog and Magog–Lord Whittington,\n  with the Lord Mayor’s show, comes to the assistance of Don Quixote\n  –Gog and Magog assail his Lordship–Lord Whittington makes a\n  speech, and deludes Gog and Magog to his party–A general scene of\n  uproar and battle among the company, until the Baron, with great\n  presence of mind, appeases the tumult.",
        "“What art thou?” exclaimed Don Quixote on his potent steed. “Who art\nthou? Speak! or, by the eternal vengeance of mine arm, thy whole\nmachinery shall perish at sound of this my trumpet!”",
        "Astonished at so rude a salutation, the great Sphinx stopped short,\nand bridling up herself, drew in her head, like a snail when it\ntouches something that it does not like: the bulls set up a horrid\nbellowing, the crickets sounded an alarm, and Gog and Magog advanced\nbefore the rest. One of these powerful brothers had in his hand a\ngreat pole, to the extremity of which was fastened a cord of about two\nfeet in length, and to the end of the cord was fastened a ball of\niron, with spikes shooting from it like the rays of a star; with this\nweapon he prepared to encounter, and advancing thus he spoke:–",
        "“Audacious wight! that thus, in complete steel arrayed, doth dare to\nventure cross my way, to stop the great Munchausen. Know then, proud\nknight, that thou shalt instant perish ’neath my potent arm.”",
        "When Quixote, Mancha’s knight, responded firm:–",
        "“Gigantic monster! leader of witches, crickets, and chimeras dire!\nknow thou, that here before yon azure heaven the cause of truth, of\nvalour, and of faith right pure shall ordeal counter try it!”",
        "Thus he spoke, and brandishing his mighty spear, would instant\nprodigies sublime perform, had not some wight placed ’neath the tail\nof dark Rosinante furze all thorny base; at which, quadrupedanting,\nplunged the steed, and instant on the earth the knight roared credo\nfor his life.",
        "At that same moment ten thousand frogs started from the morions of Gog\nand Magog, and furiously assailed the knight on every side. In vain he\nroared, and invoked fair Dulcinea del Toboso: for frogs’ wild croaking\nseemed more loud, more sonorous than all his invocations. And thus in\nbattle vile the knight was overcome, and spawn all swarmed upon his\nglittering helmet.",
        "“Detested miscreants!” roared the knight; “avaunt! Enchanters dire and\ngoblins could alone this arduous task perform; to rout the knight of\nMancha, foul defeat, and war, even such as ne’er was known before.\nThen hear, O del Toboso! hear my vows, that thus in anguish of my soul\nI urge, midst frogs, Gridalbin, Hecaton, Kai, Talon, and the Rove!\n[for such the names and definitions of their qualities, their separate\npowers.] For Merlin plumed their airy flight, and then in watery\nmoonbeam dyed his rod eccentric. At the touch ten thousand frogs,\nstrange metamorphosed, croaked even thus: And here they come, on high\nbehest, to vilify the knight that erst defended famed virginity, and\nmatrons all bewronged, and pilgrims hoar, and courteous guise of all!\nBut the age of chivalry is gone, and the glory of Europe is\nextinguished for ever?”",
        "He spake, and sudden good Lord Whittington, at head of all his raree-\nshow, came forth, armour antique of chivalry, and helmets old, and\ntroops, all streamers, flags and banners glittering gay, red, gold,\nand purple; and in every hand a square of gingerbread, all gilded\nnice, was brandished awful. At a word, ten thousand thousand Naples\nbiscuits, crackers, buns, and flannel-cakes, and hats of gingerbread\nencountered in mid air in glorious exaltation, like some huge storm of\nmill-stones, or when it rains whole clouds of dogs and cats.",
        "The frogs, astonished, thunderstruck, forgot their notes and music,\nthat before had seemed so terrible, and drowned the cries of knight\nrenown, and mute in wonder heard the words of Whittington, pronouncing\nsolemn:–\"Goblins, chimeras dire, or frogs, or whatsoe’er enchantment\nthus presents in antique shape, attend and hear the words of peace;\nand thou, good herald, read aloud the Riot Act!”",
        "He ceased, and dismal was the tone that softly breathed from all the\nfrogs in chorus, who quick had petrified with fright, unless redoubted\nGog and Magog, both with poles, high topped with airy bladders by a\nstring dependent, had not stormed against his lordship. Ever and anon\nthe bladders, loud resounding on his chaps, proclaimed their fury\nagainst all potent law, coercive mayoralty; when he, submissive, thus\nin cunning guile addressed the knights assailant:–\"Gog, Magog,\nrenowned and famous! what, my sons, shall you assail your father,\nfriend, and chief confessed? Shall you, thus armed with bladders vile,\nattack my title, eminence, and pomp sublime? Subside, vile discord,\nand again return to your true ’legiance. Think, my friends, how oft\nyour gorgeous pouch I’ve crammed, all calapash, green fat, and\ncalapee. Remember how you’ve feasted, stood inert for ages, until size\nimmense you’ve gained. And think, how different is the service of\nMunchausen, where you o’er seas, cold, briny, float along the tide,\neternal toiling like to slaves of Algiers and Tripoli. And ev’n on\nhigh, balloon like, through the heavens have journeyed late, upon a\nrainbow or some awful bridge stretched eminent, as if on earth he had\nnot work sufficient to distress your potent servitudes, but he should\nalso seek in heaven dire cause of labour! Recollect, my friends, even\nwhy or wherefore should you thus assail your lawful magistrate, or why\ndesert his livery? or for what or wherefore serve this German Lord\nMunchausen, who for all your labour shall alone bestow some fudge and\nheroic blows in war? Then cease, and thus in amity return to\nfriendship aldermanic, bungy, brown, and sober.”",
        "Ceased he then, right worshipful, when both the warring champions\ninstant stemmed their battle, and in sign of peace and unity\nreturning, ’neath their feet reclined their weapons. Sudden at a\nsignal either stamped his foot sinistrine, and the loud report of\nbursten bladder stunned each ear surrounding, like the roar of thunder\nfrom on high convulsing heaven and earth.",
        "’Twas now upon the saddle once again the knight of Mancha rose, and in\nhis hand far balancing his lance, full tilt against the troops of\nbulls opposing run. And thou, shrill Crillitrilkril, than whom no\ncricket e’er on hob of rural cottage, or chimney black, more gladsome\nturned his merry note, e’en thou didst perish, shrieking gave the\nghost in empty air, the sport of every wind; for e’en that heart so\njocund and so gay was pierced, harsh spitted by the lance of Mancha,\nwhile undaunted thou didst sit between the horns that crowned\nMowmowsky. And now Whittington advanced, ’midst armour antique and the\npowers Magog and Gog, and with his rod enchanting touched the head of\nevery frog, long mute and thunderstruck, at which, in universal chorus\nand salute, they sung blithe jocund, and amain advanced rebellious\n’gainst my troop.",
        "While Sphinx, though great, gigantic, seemed instinctive base and\ncowardly, and at the sight of storming gingerbread, and powers, Magog\nand Gog, and Quixote, all against her, started fierce, o’erturning\nboat, balloons, and all; loud roared the bulls, hideous, and the crash\nof wheels, and chaos of confusion drear, resounded far from earth to\nheaven. And still more fierce in charge the great Lord Whittington,\nfrom poke of ermine his famed Grimalkin took. She screamed, and harsh\nattacked my bulls confounded; lightning-like she darted, and from half\nthe troop their eyes devouring tore. Nor could the riders, crickets\nthroned sublime, escape from rage, from fury less averse than cannons\nmurder o’er the stormy sea. The great Mowmowsky roared amain and\nplunged in anguish, shunning every dart of fire-eyed fierce Grimalkin.\nDire the rage of warfare and contending crickets, Quixote and great\nMagog; when Whittington advancing–\"Good, my friends and warriors,\nheadlong on the foe bear down impetuous.” He spoke, and waving high\nthe mighty rod, tipped wonderful each bull, at which more fierce the\ncreatures bellowed, while enchantment drear devoured their vitals. And\nall had gone to wreck in more than mortal strife, unless, like Neptune\norient from the stormy deep, I rose, e’en towering o’er the ruins of\nmy fighting troops. Serene and calm I stood, and gazed around\nundaunted; nor did aught oppose against my foes impetuous. But sudden\nfrom chariot purses plentiful of fudge poured forth, and scattered it\namain o’er all the crowd contending. As when old Catherine or the\ncareful Joan doth scatter to the chickens bits of bread and crumbs\nfragmented, while rejoiced they gobble fast the proffered scraps in\ngeneral plenty and fraternal peace, and “hush,” she cries, “hush!\nhush!”",
