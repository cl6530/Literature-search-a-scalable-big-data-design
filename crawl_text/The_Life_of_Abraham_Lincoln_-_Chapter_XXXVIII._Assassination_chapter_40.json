        "Ward H. Lamon asserts that there was no day, from the morning Lincoln\nleft Springfield to the night of his assassination, when his life was\nnot in serious peril. If we make generous allowance for the fears which\nhad their root in Lamon’s devoted love for his chief, and for that\nnatural desire to magnify his office–for his special charge was to\nguard the President from bodily harm–which would incline him to\nestimate trifles seriously, we are still compelled to believe that the\nlife was in frequent, if not continual, danger. There are, and always\nhave been, men whose ambition is in the direction of a startling crime.\nThere were not less than three known attempts on the life of Lincoln\nbetween Springfield and Washington. There may have been others that are\nnot known. If any one was in a position to know of real and probable\nplots against the President’s life, it was Lamon. It was he, too, who\nshowed the greatest concern upon the subject, though he was personally\na man of unlimited courage.",
        "An event occurred early in 1862, which we here transcribe, not merely\nbecause of its intrinsic interest, but especially because it hints of\ndangers not known to the public. Lincoln was at this time residing at\nthe Soldier’s Home and was accustomed to riding alone to and from this\nplace. His friends could not prevail on him to accept an escort, though\nthey were in daily fear of kidnapping or murder. Lamon narrates the\noccurrence substantially (in the President’s words) as follows: One day\nhe rode up to the White House steps, where the Colonel met him, and\nwith his face full of fun, he said, “I have something to tell you.” The\ntwo entered the office, where the President locked the door and\nproceeded:",
        "“You know I have always told you I thought you an idiot that ought to\nbe put in a strait jacket for your apprehensions of my personal danger\nfrom assassination. You also know that the way we skulked into this\ncity in the first place has been a source of shame and regret to me,\nfor it did look so cowardly!”",
        "“Yes, go on.”",
        "“Well, I don’t now propose to make you my father-confessor and\nacknowledge a change of heart, yet I am free to admit that just now I\ndon’t know what to think: I am staggered. Understand me, I do not want\nto oppose my pride of opinion against light and reason, but I am in\nsuch a state of ’betweenity’ in my conclusions, that I can’t say that\nthe judgment of this court is prepared to proclaim a decision upon\nthe facts presented.”",
        "After a pause he continued:",
        "“Last night about eleven o’clock, I went to the Soldiers’ Home alone,\nriding Old Abe, as you call him; and when I arrived at the foot of\nthe hill on the road leading to the entrance to the Home grounds, I was\njogging along at a slow gait, immersed in deep thought, when suddenly I\nwas aroused–I may say the arousement lifted me out of my saddle as\nwell as out of my wits–by the report of a rifle, and seemingly the\ngunner was not fifty yards from where my contemplations ended and my\naccelerated transit began. My erratic namesake, with little warning,\ngave proof of decided dissatisfaction at the racket, and with one\nreckless bound he unceremoniously separated me from my eight-dollar\nplug hat, with which I parted company without any assent, express or\nimplied, upon my part. At a break-neck speed we soon arrived in a haven\nof safety. Meanwhile I was left in doubt whether death was more\ndesirable from being thrown from a runaway Federal horse, or as the\ntragic result of a rifle-ball fired by a disloyal bushwhacker in the\nmiddle of the night.”",
        "“I tell you there is no time on record equal to that made by the two\nOld Abes on that occasion. The historic ride of John Gilpin, and Henry\nWilson’s memorable display of bareback equestrianship on the stray army\nmule from the scenes of the battle of Bull Run, a year ago, are nothing\nin comparison to mine, either in point of time made or in ludicrous\npageantry.”",
        "“No good can result at this time from giving [this occurrence]\npublicity. It does seem to me that I am in more danger from the\naugmentation of an imaginary peril than from a judicious silence, be\nthe danger ever so great; and, moreover, I do not want it understood\nthat I share your apprehensions. I never have.”",
        "When one takes into account the number of Lincoln’s bitter enemies, and\nthe desperate character of some of them, the wonder is that he was not\nshot sooner. There were multitudes of ruffians in Washington City and\nelsewhere, who had murder in their hearts and plenty of deadly weapons\nwithin reach. Yet Lincoln lived on for four years, and was reluctant to\naccept even a nominal body guard. The striking parallel between him and\nWilliam the Silent will at once occur to the reader. He, like Lincoln,\nwould take no precaution. He exposed himself freely, and there were\nplots almost innumerable against his life before he was slain. Such\npersons seem to have invisible defenders.",
        "Lincoln was not a fatalist, but he did believe that he would live to\ncomplete his specific work and that he would not live beyond that.\nPerhaps he was wise in this. Had he surrounded himself with pomp and\ndefense after the manner of Fremont he could not have done his work at\nall, for his special calling required that he should keep near to the\npeople, and not isolate himself. Moreover, it is a question whether an\nelaborate show of defense would not have invited a correspondingly\nelaborate ingenuity in attack. His very trustfulness must have disarmed\nsome. The wonder is not that he was slain at last, but that under the\ncircumstances he was not slain earlier.",
        "Much has been written, and perhaps justly, of Lincoln’s presentiments.\nIt is not exceptional, it is common in all rural communities to\nmultiply and magnify signs. The commonest occurrences are invested with\nan occult meaning. Seeing the new moon over the right shoulder or over\nthe left shoulder, the howling of a dog at night, the chance assemblage\nof thirteen persons, the spilling of salt,–these and a thousand other\nthings are taken to be signs of something. The habit of attending to\nthese things probably originates in mere amusements. It takes the\nplace, or furnishes the material, of small talk. But years of attention\nto these things, especially in the susceptible period of childhood and\nyouth, are almost certain to have a lasting effect. A person gets into\nthe habit of noting them, of looking for them, and the influence\nbecomes ingrained in his very nature so that it is next to impossible\nto shake it off. This condition is a feature of all rural communities,\nnot only in the West, but in New England: in fact, in Europe, Asia,\nAfrica, and Australia.",
        "Lincoln shared the impressibility of the community in which he grew up;\nno more, no less. Like all the rest, indeed, like all of mankind, he\ncounted the hits, not the misses. Being unusually outspoken, he often\ntold of impressions which another would not have mentioned. The very\ntelling of them magnified their importance. He had been having\npremonitions all his life, and it would be strange if he did not have\nsome just before his death. He did, and these are the ones that are\nremembered.",
        "In spite of all, he was in excellent spirits on Good Friday, April 14,\n1865. The burdens and sorrows of bloodshed had made an old man of him.\nBut the war was at an end, the stars and stripes were floating over\nSumter, the Union was saved, and slavery was doomed. There came back\ninto his eyes the light that had long been absent. Those who were about\nhim said the elasticity of his movements and joyousness of his manner\nwere marked. “His mood all day was singularly happy and tender.”",
        "The events of the day were simple. It was the day of the regular\nmeeting of the cabinet. Grant, who had arrived in Washington that\nmorning, attended this meeting. It was the President’s idea that the\nleaders of the Confederacy should be allowed to escape,–much as he had\nalready jocularly advised Grant to let Jeff Davis escape “all unbeknown\nto himself.” He spoke plainly on the subject. “No one need expect me to\ntake any part in hanging or killing these men, even the worst of them.\nEnough lives have been sacrificed.” After the discussion of various\nmatters, when the cabinet adjourned until the following Tuesday, the\nlast words he ever uttered to them were that “they must now begin to\nact in the interests of peace.”",
        "In the afternoon he went for a drive with Mrs. Lincoln. The\nconversation embraced plans of living–in Chicago? or California?–\nafter the expiration of his term of office. This fact shows that his\npresentments did not make so real an impression on him as many people\nhave believed.",
        "Three days before this his devoted servant Colonel Lamon–we might\nalmost call him his faithful watch-dog, so loving, loyal, and watchful\nwas he–had gone on an errand for him to Richmond. Lamon, who was loath\nto start, tried to secure from him a promise in advance of divulging\nwhat it was to be. Lincoln, after much urging, said he thought he would\nventure to make the promise. It was that he would promise not to go out\nafter night in Lamon’s absence, and particularly to the theater\n(italics Lamon’s). The President first joked about it, but being\npersistently entreated said at last: “Well, I promise to do the best I\ncan towards it.”",
        "But for the evening of the day under consideration, Mrs. Lincoln had\ngot up a theater party–her husband was always fond of the diversion\nof the theater. The party was to include General and Mrs. Grant. But\nthe general’s plans required him to go that evening to Philadelphia,\nand so Major Rathbone and Miss Harris were substituted. This party\noccupied the upper proscenium box on the right of the stage.",
        "About ten o’clock, J. Wilkes Booth, a young actor twenty-six years of\nage, and very handsome, glided along the corridor towards that box.\nBeing himself an actor and well known by the employees of the theater,\nhe was suffered to proceed without hindrance. Passing through the\ncorridor door he fastened it shut by means of a bar that fitted into a\nniche previously prepared, and making an effectual barricade. A hole\nhad been bored through the door leading into the box so that he could\nsurvey the inmates without attracting their attention. With revolver in\none hand and dagger in the other he noiselessly entered the box and\nstood directly behind the President who was enjoying the humor of the\ncomedy.",
        "“The awful tragedy in the box makes everything else seem pale and\nunreal. Here were five human beings in a narrow space–the greatest man\nof his time, in the glory of the most stupendous success in our\nhistory, the idolized chief of a nation already mighty, with\nillimitable vistas of grandeur to come; his beloved wife, proud and\nhappy; a pair of betrothed lovers, with all the promise of felicity\nthat youth, social position, and wealth could give them; and this young\nactor, handsome as Endymion upon Latmos, the pet of his little world.\nThe glitter of fame, happiness, and ease was upon the entire group, but\nin an instant everything was to be changed with the blinding swiftness\nof enchantment. Quick death was to come on the central figure of that\ncompany–the central figure, we believe, of the great and good men of\nthe century. Over all the rest the blackest fates hovered menacingly–\nfates from which a mother might pray that kindly death would save her\nchildren in their infancy. One was to wander with the stain of murder\non his soul, with the curses of a world upon his name, with a price set\nupon his head, in frightful physical pain, till he died a dog’s death\nin a burning barn; the stricken wife was to pass the rest of her days\nin melancholy and madness; of those two young lovers, one was to slay\nthe other, and then end his life a raving maniac” (Nicolay and Hay, X.\n295).",
        "The revolver was thrust near to the back of the head of the\nunsuspecting victim–that kind man who had “never willingly planted a\nthorn in any man’s bosom,” who could not bear to witness suffering even\nin an animal. The report of the pistol was somewhat muffled and was\nunnoticed by the majority of the audience. The ball penetrated the\nPresident’s brain, and without word or sound his head dropped upon his\nbreast. Major Rathbone took in the situation and sprang at the murderer\nwho slashed him savagely with the dagger, tore himself free, and leaped\nover the balustrade upon the stage. It was not a high leap for an\nathletic young man, but his spur caught in a flag with which the box\nwas draped, so that he did not strike quite squarely on his feet. The\nresult was that he broke his leg or ankle. But gathering himself up, he\nflourished his dagger, declaiming the motto of Virginia, Sic semper\nTyrannis (Thus ever to tyrants), and before the audience could realize\nwhat was done, he disappeared. He ran out of the rear of the theater\nwhere a fleet horse was in waiting. He mounted and rode for his life.\nFor eleven days he was in hiding, with the curse of Cain upon him,\nsuffering all the while excruciating agonies from his broken leg, which\ncould be but imperfectly cared for. He was finally corralled in a barn,\nthe barn was set on fire, and while thus at bay he was shot down.",
        "Aid came at once to the President, but the surgeons saw at a glance\nthat the wound was mortal. They carried him out into the open air. When\nthey reached the street the question arose, Where shall we take him? On\nthe opposite side of the street was an unpretentious hotel. A man,\nstanding on the front steps, saw the commotion and asked what it meant.\nOn being told, he said, “Take him to my room.” It was thus that the\ngreatest man of the age died in a small room of a common hotel. But\nthis was not unfitting; he was of the plain people, he always loved\nthem, and among them he closed his earthly record. He lingered\nunconscious through the night, and at twenty minutes after seven\no’clock, on the morning of April 15th, he died.",
        "The band of assassins of which Booth was the head, planned to murder\nalso other officials. Grant escaped, having suddenly left the city. The\nonly other person who was actually attacked was Seward. Though the\nassassin was a giant in stature and in strength, though he fought like\na madman, and though Seward was at the time in bed with his right arm\nand jaw fractured, he having been thrown from a horse, yet strangely\nenough he was not killed. The assassin inflicted many and terrible\nwounds, especially upon Frederick Seward, his son, who did not regain\nconsciousness for weeks; but no one in that house was killed.",
        "Surely never did the telegraph hear heavier news than when it flashed\nthe message, “Lincoln has been assassinated.” More than one ex-\nConfederate stoutly declared that “when Lincoln was murdered the South\nlost its best friend.” And thousands of others replied, that was the\ntruth! At the dedication of his monument in 1874 General Grant gave\nutterance again to this thought: “In his death the nation lost its\ngreatest hero; in his death the South lost its most just friend.”",
