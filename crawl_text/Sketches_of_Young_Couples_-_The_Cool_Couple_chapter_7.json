        "There is an old-fashioned weather-glass representing a house with\ntwo doorways, in one of which is the figure of a gentleman, in the\nother the figure of a lady.  When the weather is to be fine the\nlady comes out and the gentleman goes in; when wet, the gentleman\ncomes out and the lady goes in.  They never seek each other’s\nsociety, are never elevated and depressed by the same cause, and\nhave nothing in common.  They are the model of a cool couple,\nexcept that there is something of politeness and consideration\nabout the behaviour of the gentleman in the weather-glass, in\nwhich, neither of the cool couple can be said to participate.",
        "The cool couple are seldom alone together, and when they are,\nnothing can exceed their apathy and dulness:  the gentleman being\nfor the most part drowsy, and the lady silent.  If they enter into\nconversation, it is usually of an ironical or recriminatory nature.\nThus, when the gentleman has indulged in a very long yawn and\nsettled himself more snugly in his easy-chair, the lady will\nperhaps remark, ’Well, I am sure, Charles!  I hope you’re\ncomfortable.’  To which the gentleman replies, ’Oh yes, he’s quite\ncomfortable quite.’  ’There are not many married men, I hope,’\nreturns the lady, ’who seek comfort in such selfish gratifications\nas you do.’  ’Nor many wives who seek comfort in such selfish\ngratifications as YOU do, I hope,’ retorts the gentleman.  ’Whose\nfault is that?’ demands the lady.  The gentleman becoming more\nsleepy, returns no answer.  ’Whose fault is that?’ the lady\nrepeats.  The gentleman still returning no answer, she goes on to\nsay that she believes there never was in all this world anybody so\nattached to her home, so thoroughly domestic, so unwilling to seek\na moment’s gratification or pleasure beyond her own fireside as\nshe.  God knows that before she was married she never thought or\ndreamt of such a thing; and she remembers that her poor papa used\nto say again and again, almost every day of his life, ’Oh, my dear\nLouisa, if you only marry a man who understands you, and takes the\ntrouble to consider your happiness and accommodate himself a very\nlittle to your disposition, what a treasure he will find in you!’\nShe supposes her papa knew what her disposition was - he had known\nher long enough - he ought to have been acquainted with it, but\nwhat can she do?  If her home is always dull and lonely, and her\nhusband is always absent and finds no pleasure in her society, she\nis naturally sometimes driven (seldom enough, she is sure) to seek\na little recreation elsewhere; she is not expected to pine and mope\nto death, she hopes.  ’Then come, Louisa,’ says the gentleman,\nwaking up as suddenly as he fell asleep, ’stop at home this\nevening, and so will I.’  ’I should be sorry to suppose, Charles,\nthat you took a pleasure in aggravating me,’ replies the lady; ’but\nyou know as well as I do that I am particularly engaged to Mrs.\nMortimer, and that it would be an act of the grossest rudeness and\nill-breeding, after accepting a seat in her box and preventing her\nfrom inviting anybody else, not to go.’  ’Ah! there it is!’ says\nthe gentleman, shrugging his shoulders, ’I knew that perfectly\nwell.  I knew you couldn’t devote an evening to your own home.  Now\nall I have to say, Louisa, is this - recollect that I was quite\nwilling to stay at home, and that it’s no fault of MINE we are not\noftener together.’",
        "With that the gentleman goes away to keep an old appointment at his\nclub, and the lady hurries off to dress for Mrs. Mortimer’s; and\nneither thinks of the other until by some odd chance they find\nthemselves alone again.",
        "But it must not be supposed that the cool couple are habitually a\nquarrelsome one.  Quite the contrary.  These differences are only\noccasions for a little self-excuse, - nothing more.  In general\nthey are as easy and careless, and dispute as seldom, as any common\nacquaintances may; for it is neither worth their while to put each\nother out of the way, nor to ruffle themselves.",
        "When they meet in society, the cool couple are the best-bred people\nin existence.  The lady is seated in a corner among a little knot\nof lady friends, one of whom exclaims, ’Why, I vow and declare\nthere is your husband, my dear!’  ’Whose? - mine?’ she says,\ncarelessly.  ’Ay, yours, and coming this way too.’  ’How very odd!’\nsays the lady, in a languid tone, ’I thought he had been at Dover.’\nThe gentleman coming up, and speaking to all the other ladies and\nnodding slightly to his wife, it turns out that he has been at\nDover, and has just now returned.  ’What a strange creature you\nare!’ cries his wife; ’and what on earth brought you here, I\nwonder?’  ’I came to look after you, OF COURSE,’ rejoins her\nhusband.  This is so pleasant a jest that the lady is mightily\namused, as are all the other ladies similarly situated who are\nwithin hearing; and while they are enjoying it to the full, the\ngentleman nods again, turns upon his heel, and saunters away.",
        "There are times, however, when his company is not so agreeable,\nthough equally unexpected; such as when the lady has invited one or\ntwo particular friends to tea and scandal, and he happens to come\nhome in the very midst of their diversion.  It is a hundred chances\nto one that he remains in the house half an hour, but the lady is\nrather disturbed by the intrusion, notwithstanding, and reasons\nwithin herself, - ’I am sure I never interfere with him, and why\nshould he interfere with me?  It can scarcely be accidental; it\nnever happens that I have a particular reason for not wishing him\nto come home, but he always comes.  It’s very provoking and\ntiresome; and I am sure when he leaves me so much alone for his own\npleasure, the least he could do would be to do as much for mine.’\nObserving what passes in her mind, the gentleman, who has come home\nfor his own accommodation, makes a merit of it with himself;\narrives at the conclusion that it is the very last place in which\nhe can hope to be comfortable; and determines, as he takes up his\nhat and cane, never to be so virtuous again.",
        "Thus a great many cool couples go on until they are cold couples,\nand the grave has closed over their folly and indifference.  Loss\nof name, station, character, life itself, has ensued from causes as\nslight as these, before now; and when gossips tell such tales, and\naggravate their deformities, they elevate their hands and eyebrows,\nand call each other to witness what a cool couple Mr. and Mrs. So-\nand-so always were, even in the best of times.",
