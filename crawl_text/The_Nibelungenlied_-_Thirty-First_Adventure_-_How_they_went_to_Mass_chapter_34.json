        "“So cool doth grow my armor,\" / Volker made remark,\n“I ween but little longer / will endure the dark.\nBy the air do I perceive it, / that soon will break the day.\"\nThen waked they many a warrior / who still in deepest slumber lay.",
        "1850",
        "When brake the light of morning / athwart the spacious hall,\nHagen gan awaken / the stranger warriors all,\nIf that they to the minster / would go to holy mass.\nAfter the Christian custom, / of bells a mickle ringing was.",
        "1851",
        "There sang they all uneven, / that plainly might ye see\nHow Christian men and heathen / did not full well agree.\nEach one of Gunther’s warriors / would hear the service sung,\nSo were they all together / up from their night-couches sprung.",
        "1852",
        "Then did the warriors lace them / in so goodly dress,\nThat never heroes any, / that king did e’er possess,\nMore richly stood attired; / that Hagen grieved to see.\nQuoth he: “Ye knights, far other / here must your attire be.",
        "1853",
        "“Yea, know among you many / how here the case doth stand.\nBear ye instead of roses / your good swords in hand,\nFor chaplets all bejewelled / your glancing helmets good,\nSince we have well perceived / how is the angry Kriemhild’s mood.",
        "1854",
        "“To-day must we do battle, / that will I now declare.\nInstead of silken tunic / shall ye good hauberks wear,\nAnd for embroidered mantle / a trusty shield and wide,\nThat ye may well defend you, / if ye must others’ anger bide.",
        "1855",
        "“My masters well beloved, / knights and kinsmen true,\n’Tis meet that ye betake you / unto the minster too,\nThat God do not forsake you / in peril and in need,\nFor certain now I make you / that death is nigh to us indeed.",
        "1856",
        "“Forget ye not whatever / wrong ye e’er have done,\nBut there ’fore God right meekly / all your errors own;\nThereto would I advise you, / ye knights of high degree,\nFor God alone in heaven / may will that other mass ye see.”",
        "1857",
        "Thus went they to the minster, / the princes and their men.\nWithin the holy churchyard / bade them Hagen then\nStand all still together / that they part not at all.\nQuoth he: “Knows not any / what may at hands of Huns befall.",
        "1858",
        "“Let stand, good friends, all ready, / your shields before your feet,\nThat if ever any / would you in malice greet,\nWith deep-cut wound ye pay him; / that is Hagen’s rede,\nThat from men may never / aught but praises be your meed.”",
        "1859",
        "Volker and Hagen, / the twain thence did pass\nBefore the broad minster. / Therein their purpose was\nThat the royal Kriemhild / must meet them where they stood\nThere athwart her pathway. / In sooth full grim she was of mood.",
        "1860",
        "Then came the royal Etzel / and eke his spouse full fair.\nAttired were the warriors / all in raiment rare\nThat following full stately / with her ye might see;\nThe dust arose all densely / round Kriemhild’s mickle company.",
        "1861",
        "When the lofty monarch / thus all armed did see\nThe kings and their followers, / straightway then cried he:\n“How see I in this fashion / my friends with helm on head?\nBy my troth I sorrow / if ill to them have happened.",
        "1862",
        "“I’ll gladly make atonement / as doth to them belong.\nHath any them affronted / or done them aught of wrong,\nTo me ’tis mickle sorrow, / well may they understand.\nTo serve them am I ready, / in whatsoever they command.”",
        "1863",
        "Thereto gave answer Hagen: / “Here hath wronged us none.\n’Tis custom of my masters / to keep their armor on\nTill full three days be over, / when high festival they hold.\nDid any here molest us, / to Etzel would the thing be told.”",
        "1864",
        "Full well heard Kriemhild likewise / how Hagen gave reply.\nUpon him what fierce glances / flashed furtively her eye!\nYet betray she would not / the custom of her country,\nThough well she long had known it / in the land of Burgundy.",
        "1865",
        "How grim soe’er and mighty / the hate to them she bore,\nHad any told to Etzel / how stood the thing before,\nWell had he prevented / what there anon befell.\nSo haughty were they minded / that none to him the same would tell.",
        "1866",
        "With the queen came forward / there a mighty train,\nBut no two handbreadths yielded / yet those warriors twain\nTo make way before her. / The Huns did wrathful grow,\nThat their mistress passing / should by them be jostled so.",
        "1867",
        "Etzel’s highborn pages / were sore displeased thereat,\nAnd had upon the strangers / straightway spent their hate,\nBut that they durst not do it / their high lord before.\nThere was a mickle pressing, / yet naught of anger happened more.",
        "1868",
        "When they thence were parting / from holy service done,\nOn horse came quickly prancing / full many a nimble Hun.\nWith the Lady Kriemhild / went many a maiden fair,\nAnd eke to make her escort / seven thousand knights rode there.",
        "1869",
        "Kriemhild with her ladies / within the casement sat\nBy Etzel, mighty monarch, / –full pleased he was thereat.\nThey wished to view the tourney / of knights beyond compare.\nWhat host of strangers riding / thronged the court before them there!",
        "1870",
        "The marshal with the squires / not in vain ye sought,\nDankwart the full valiant: / with him had he brought\nHis royal master’s followers / of the land of Burgundy.\nFor the valiant Nibelungen / the steeds well saddled might ye see.",
        "1871",
        "When their steeds they mounted, / the kings and all their men,\nVolker thane full doughty, / gave his counsel then,\nThat after their country’s fashion / they ride a mass mellay.\nHis rede the heroes followed / and tourneyed in full stately way.",
        "1872",
        "The knight had counsel given / in sooth that pleased them well;\nThe clash of arms in mellay / soon full loud did swell.\nMany a valiant warrior / did thereto resort,\nAs Etzel and Kriemhild / looked down upon the spacious court.",
        "1873",
        "Came there unto the mellay / six hundred knights of those\nThat followed Dietrich’s bidding, / the strangers to oppose.\nPastime would they make them / with the men of Burgundy,\nAnd if he leave had granted. / had done the same right willingly.",
        "1874",
        "In their company rode there / how many a warrior bold!\nWhen unto Sir Dietrich / then the thing was told,\nForbade he that ’gainst Gunther’s / men they join the play.\nHe feared lest harm befall them, / and well his counsel did he weigh.",
        "1875",
        "When of Bern the warriors / thence departed were,\nCame they of Bechelaren, / the men of Ruediger,\nBearing shield five hundred, / and rode before the hall;\nRather had the margrave / that they came there not at all.",
        "1876",
        "Prudently then rode he / amid their company\nAnd told unto his warriors / how they might plainly see,\nThat the men of Gunther / were in evil mood:\nDid they forego the mellay, / please him better far it would.",
        "1877",
        "When they were thence departed, / the stately knights and bold,\nCame they of Thuringia, / as hath to us been told,\nAnd of them of Denmark / a thousand warriors keen.\nFrom crash of spear up-flying / full frequent were the splinters seen.",
        "1878",
        "Irnfried and Hawart / rode into the mellay,\nWhom the gallant men of Rhineland / received in knightly play:\nFull oft the men of Thuringia / they met in tournament,\nWhereby the piercing lance-point / through many a stately shield was\n      sent.",
        "1879",
        "Eke with three thousand warriors / came Sir Bloedel there.\nEtzel and Kriemhild / were of his coming ware,\nAs this play of chivalry / before them they did see.\nNow hoped the queen that evil / befall the men of Burgundy.",
        "1880",
        "Schrutan and Gibecke / rode into the mellay,\nEke Ramung and Hornbog / after the Hunnish way;\nYet must they come to standstill / ’fore the thanes of Burgundy.\nHigh against the palace / wall the splintered shafts did fly.",
        "1881",
        "How keen soe’er the contest, / ’twas naught but knightly sport.\nWith shock of shields and lances / heard ye the palace court\nLoud give back the echo / where Gunther’s men rode on.\nHis followers in the jousting / on every side high honor won.",
        "1882",
        "So long they held such pastime / and with so mickle heat\nThat through the broidered trappings / oozed clear drops of sweat\nFrom the prancing chargers / whereon the knights did ride.\nIn full gallant manner / their skill against the Huns they tried.",
        "1883",
        "Then outspake the Fiddler, / Volker deft of hand:\n“These knights, I ween, too timid / are ’gainst us to stand.\nOft did I hear the story / what hate to us they bore;\nThan this a fairer season / to vent it, find they nevermore.”",
        "1884",
        "“Lead back unto the stables,\" / once more spake Volker then,\n“Now our weary chargers; / we’ll ride perchance again\nWhen comes the cool of evening, / if fitting time there be.\nMayhap the queen will honor / award to men of Burgundy.”",
        "1885",
        "Beheld they then prick hither / one dressed in state so rare\nThat of the Huns none other / might with him compare.\nBelike from castle tower / did watch his fair lady;\nSo gay was his apparel / as it some knight’s bride might be.",
        "1886",
        "Then again quoth Volker: / “How may I stay my hand?\nYonder ladies’ darling / a knock shall understand.\nLet no man here deter me, / I’ll give him sudden check.\nHow spouse of royal Etzel / thereat may rage, I little reck.”",
        "1887",
        "“Nay, as thou dost love me,\" / straight King Gunther spake;\n“All men will but reproach us / if such affront we make.\nThe Huns be first offenders, / for such would more befit.\"\nStill did the royal Etzel / in casement by Queen Kriemhild sit.",
        "1888",
        "“I’ll add unto the mellay,\" / Hagen did declare;\n“Let now all these ladies / and knights be made aware\nHow we can ride a charger; / ’twere well we make it known,\nFor, come what may, small honor / shall here to Gunther’s men be shown.”",
        "1889",
        "Once more the nimble Volker / into the mellay spurred,\nWhereat full many a lady / soon to weep was heard.\nHis lance right through the body / of that gay Hun he sent:\n’Twas cause that many a woman / and maiden fair must sore lament.",
        "1890",
        "Straight dashed into the mellay / Hagen and his men.\nWith three score of his warriors / spurred he quickly then\nForward where the Fiddler / played so lustily.\nEtzel and Kriemhild / full plainly might the passage see.",
        "1891",
        "Then would the kings their minstrel / –that may ye fairly know–\nLeave not all defenceless / there amid the foe.\nWith them a thousand heroes / rode forth full dexterously,\nAnd soon had gained their purpose / with show of proudest chivalry.",
        "1892",
        "When in such rude fashion / the stately Hun was slain,\nMight ye hear his kinsmen / weeping loud complain.\nThen all around did clamor: / “Who hath the slayer been?\"\n“None but the Fiddler was it, / Volker the minstrel keen.”",
        "1893",
        "For swords and for shields then / called full speedily\nThat slain margrave’s kinsmen / of the Hun’s country.\nTo avenge him sought they / Volker in turn to slay.\nIn haste down from the casement / royal Etzel made his way.",
        "1894",
        "Arose a mighty clamor / from the people all;\nThe kings and men of Burgundy / dismounted ’fore the hall,\nAnd likewise their chargers / to the rear did send.\nCame then the mighty Etzel / and sought to bring the strife to end.",
        "1895",
        "From one of that Hun’s kinsmen / who near by him did stand\nSnatched he a mighty weapon / quick from out his hand,\nAnd therewith backward smote them, / for fierce his anger wrought.\n“Shall thus my hospitality / unto these knights be brought to naught?”",
        "1896",
        "“If ye the valiant minstrel / here ’fore me should slay,\"\nSpake the royal Etzel, / “it were an evil day.\nWhen he the Hun impaled / I did observe full well,\nThat not through evil purpose / but by mishap it so befell.",
        "1897",
        "“These my guests now must ye / ne’er disturb in aught.\"\nHimself became their escort. / Away their steeds were brought\nUnto the stables / by many a waiting squire,\nWho ready at their bidding / stood to meet their least desire.",
        "1898",
        "The host with the strangers / into the palace went,\nNor would he suffer any / further his wrath to vent.\nSoon were the tables ready / and water for them did wait.\nMany then had gladly / on them of Rhineland spent their hate.",
        "1899",
        "Not yet the lords were seated / till some time was o’er.\nFor Kriemhild o’er her sorrow / meantime did trouble sore.\nShe spake: “Of Bern, O Master, / thy counsel grant to me,\nThy help and eke thy mercy, / for here in sorry plight I be.”",
        "1900",
        "To her gave answer Hildebrand, / a thane right praiseworthy:\n“Who harms the Nibelungen / shall ne’er have help of me,\nHow great soe’er the guerdon. / Such deed he well may rue,\nFor never yet did any / these gallant doughty knights subdue.”",
        "1901",
        "Eke in courteous manner / Sir Dietrich her addressed:\n“Vain, O lofty mistress, / unto me thy quest.\nIn sooth thy lofty kinsmen / have wronged me not at all,\nThat I on thanes so valorous / should thus with murderous purpose fall.",
        "1902",
        "“Thy prayer doth thee small honor, / O high and royal dame,\nThat upon thy kinsmen / thou so dost counsel shame.\nThy grace to have they deemed / when came they to this land.\nNevermore shall Siegfried / avenged be by Dietrich’s hand.”",
        "1903",
        "When she no guile discovered / in the knight of Bern,\nUnto Bloedel straightway / did she hopeful turn\nWith promise of wide marches / that Nudung erst did own.\nSlew him later Dankwart / that he forgot the gift full soon.",
        "1904",
        "Spake she: “Do thou help me, / Sir Bloedel, I pray.\nYea, within the palace / are foes of mine this day,\nWho erstwhile slew Siegfried, / spouse full dear to me.\nWho helps me to avenge it, / to him I’ll e’er beholden be.”",
        "1905",
        "Thereto gave answer Bloedel: / “Lady, be well aware,\nNe’er to do them evil / ’fore Etzel may I dare,\nFor to thy kinsmen, lady, / beareth he good will.\nNe’er might the king me pardon, / wrought I upon them aught of ill.”",
        "1906",
        "“But nay, Sir Bloedel, my favor / shall thou have evermore.\nYea, give I thee for guerdon / silver and gold in store,\nAnd eke a fairest lady, / that Nudung erst should wed:\nBy her fond embraces / may’st thou well be comforted.",
        "1907",
        "“The land and eke the castles, / all to thee I’ll give;\nYea, may’st thou, knight full noble, / in joyance ever live,\nCall’st thou thine the marches, / wherein did Nudung dwell.\nWhate’er this day I promise, / fulfil it all I will full well.”",
        "1908",
        "When understood Sir Bloedel / what gain should be his share,\nAnd pleased him well the lady / for that she was so fair,\nBy force of arms then thought he / to win her for his wife.\nThereby the knight aspirant / was doomed anon to lose his life.",
        "1909",
        "“Unto the hall betake thee,\" / quoth he unto the queen,\n“Alarum I will make thee / ere any know, I ween.\nAtone shall surely Hagen / where he hath done thee wrong:\nTo thee I’ll soon give over / King Gunther’s man in fetters strong.”",
        "1910",
        "“To arms, to arms!” quoth Bloedel, / “my good warriors all:\nIn their followers’ quarters / upon the foe we’ll fall.\nHerefrom will not release me / royal Etzel’s wife.\nTo win this venture therefore / fear not each one to lose his life.”",
        "1911",
        "When at length Queen Kriemhild / found Bloedel well content\nTo fulfil her bidding, / she to table went\nWith the monarch Etzel / and eke a goodly band.\nDire was the treason / she against the guests had planned.",
        "1912",
        "Since in none other manner / she knew the strife to start,\n(Kriemhild’s ancient sorrow / still rankled in her heart),\nBade she bring to table / Etzel’s youthful son:\nBy woman bent on vengeance / how might more awful deed be done?",
        "1913",
        "Went upon the instant / four of Etzel’s men,\nAnd soon came bearing Ortlieb, / the royal scion, then\nUnto the princes’ table, / where eke grim Hagen sate.\nThe child was doomed to perish / by reason of his deadly hate.",
        "1914",
        "When the mighty monarch / then his child did see,\nUnto his lady’s kinsmen / in manner kind spake he:\n“Now, my good friends, behold ye / here my only son,\nAnd child of your high sister: / may it bring you profit every one.",
        "1915",
        "“Grow he but like his kindred, / a valiant man he’ll be,\nA mighty king and noble, / doughty and fair to see.\nLive I but yet a little, / twelve lands shall he command;\nMay ye have faithful service / from the youthful Ortlieb’s hand.",
        "1916",
        "“Therefore grant me favor, / ye good friends of mine;\nWhen to your country ride ye / again unto the Rhine,\nShall ye then take with you / this your sister’s son,\nAnd at your hands may ever / by the child full fair be done.",
        "1917",
        "“Bring him up in honor / until to manhood grown.\nIf then in any country / hath wrong to you been done,\nHe’ll help you by his valor / vengeance swift to wreak.\"\nEke heard the Lady Kriemhild / royal Etzel thus to speak.",
        "1918",
        "“Well might these my masters / on his faith rely,\nGrew he e’er to manhood,\" / Hagen made reply:\n“Yet is the prince, I fear me, / more early doomed of fate.\n’Twere strange did any see me / ever at court on Ortlieb wait.”",
        "1919",
        "The monarch glanced at Hagen, / sore grieved at what he heard;\nAlthough the king full gallant / thereto spake ne’er a word,\nNatheless his heart was saddened / and heavy was his mind.\nNowise the mood of Hagen / was to merriment inclined.",
        "1920",
        "It grieved all the princes / and the royal host\nThat of his child did Hagen / make such idle boast.\nThat they must likewise leave it / unanswered, liked they not:\nThey little weaned what havoc / should by the thane anon be wrought.",
