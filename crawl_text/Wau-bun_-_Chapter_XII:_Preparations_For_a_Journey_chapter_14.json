        "Early in January the snow fell in great abundance. We had an unusual\nquantity at the Portage, but in “the diggings,” as the lead-mining\ncountry was called, it was of an unheard-of depth–five or six feet upon\na level.",
        "An express had been dispatched to Chicago by the officers to take our\nletters, and bring back the mail from that place. A tough, hardy\nsoldier, named Sulky, acted as messenger, and he had hitherto made light\nof his burden or the length of the way, notwithstanding that his task\nwas performed on foot with his pack upon his shoulders. But now Sulky\nhad been absent some weeks, and we had given him up entirely, persuaded\nthat he must have perished with cold and starvation.",
        "At length he appeared, nearly blind from travelling in the snow. He had\nlain by three weeks in an Indian lodge, the snow being too deep to\npermit him to journey. The account he gave put an end to the hopes I had\nbegun to entertain of being able to visit our friends at Chicago in the\ncourse of this winter.",
        "We had, before the last heavy fall of snow, been forming plans to that\neffect. Captain Harney had kindly commenced preparing some trains, or\nboxes placed on sledges, which it was thought would, when lined with\nbuffalo-skins, furnish a very comfortable kind of vehicle for the\njourney; and I was still inclined to think a good, deep bed of snow over\nthe whole country no great obstacle to a sleigh-ride. The whole matter\nwas, however, cut short by the commanding officer, who from the first\nhad violently opposed the scheme, declaring that he would order the\nsentinels to fire on us if we attempted to leave the fort. So, finding\nthe majority against us, we were obliged to yield.",
        "The arrival of sweet, lovely little Lizzie Twiggs, before January was\nquite past, was an event that shed light and joy in at least two\ndwellings. It seemed as if she belonged to all of us, and as she\nincreased in size and beauty it was hard to say who, among us all, was\nmost proud of her. If we had ever felt any languid hours before, we\ncould have none now–she was the pet, the darling, the joint property of\nboth households.",
        "Whatever regret I might have had, previous to this event, at the idea\nof leaving my friend for the three weeks to which we proposed to limit\nour visit to Chicago, I felt now that she would scarcely miss me, and\nthat we might hold ourselves in readiness to take advantage of the first\nimprovement in the weather, to put this favorite project in execution.",
        "During the latter part of February the cold became less severe. The\nsnows melted away, and by the beginning of March the weather was so warm\nand genial, that we were quite confident of being able to make the\njourney on horseback without any serious difficulty.",
        "Our plans once settled upon, the first thing to be provided was warm and\ncomfortable apparel. A riding-habit of stout broadcloth was pronounced\nindispensable to my equipment. But of such an article I was destitute.\nNothing among my wedding travelling gear seemed in any way to offer a\nsubstitute. What was to be done? The requisite material was to be found\nin abundance at the sutler’s store (the shantee, as it was technically\ntermed), but how to get it manufactured into a suitable garment was the\nquestion.",
        "The regimental tailor was summoned. He was cook to one of the companies,\nand there were at first some doubts whether he could be permitted to\nforsake the spit for the needle, during the time I should require his\nservices. All his tailoring-work had, heretofore, been done at odd times\non a bench in the company kitchen, and thither he now proposed to carry\nthe riding-habit. I suggested that, in order to superintend the work, I\nshould thus be driven to take up my abode for the time being in the\nbarracks, which would be a decided inconvenience.",
        "To remedy the difficulty, he was finally so happy as to find a soldier\nin “Company D,” who consented to officiate in his place as cook until\nhis term of service to me should expire.",
        "Behold, then, a little, solemn-looking man in his stocking-feet, seated\ncross-legged on an Indian mat by my parlor window. He had made all his\narrangements himself, and I deemed it wisest not to interfere with him.\nThe cutting-out was the most difficult part, and, as he had never made a\nlady’s riding-habit, that task fell to my share. I was as great a novice\nas himself, and I must admit that this, my first effort, was open to\ncriticism. But the little tailor was of a different opinion. He was in\nan ecstasy with our joint performance.",
        "“Upon my word, madam,” he would exclaim, surveying it with admiring\neyes, “we shall have a very respectable garment!” I do not know how many\ntimes he repeated this during the three days that the work was in\nprogress.",
        "I believe he had not perfect confidence in the culinary powers of his\ncomrade of “Company D,” for regularly a half-hour before beat of drum\nhis work was folded and laid aside, his snips gathered up, and, all\nthings being restored to order, he would slip out, resume his shoes,\nwhich, Turk-like, he had left outside the door, and speed over to the\nbarrack-kitchen to see how matters were going on.",
        "In the mean time, great preparations were making below, under the\nsupervision of our tidy, active little French servant, Mrs. Pillon, the\nwife of one of the engagés, by whom the irregular and unmanageable\nLouisa had been replaced.",
        "Biscuits were baked, a ham, some tongues, and sundry pieces of salt pork\nwere boiled, coffee roasted and ground, sugar cracked, isinglass cut in\npieces of the size requisite for a pot of coffee. For the reception of\nall these different articles cotton bags of different sizes had been\npreviously prepared. Large sacks of skin, called by the Canadians\nporches, were also provided to hold the more bulky provisions, for our\njourney was to be a long one.",
        "The distance from Fort Winnebago to Chicago was not very formidable, it\nis true, if the direct route were taken; but that we knew to be\nimpossible at this season of the year. The route by Kosh-ko-nong was out\nof the question; all the Indians being absent from their villages in the\nwinter, and the ice being now gone, we could have no means of crossing\nthe Rock River at that place.",
        "There remained therefore no alternative but to proceed south to Dixon,\nor, as it was then called, Ogie’s Ferry, the only certain means of\ncrossing this broad and rapid stream. This route being so much out of\nour direct course that we could not hope to accomplish it in less than\nsix days, it was necessary to prepare accordingly.",
        "While the wardrobe and provisions were thus in preparation, arrangements\nwere also being made as to our retinue and mode of conveyance.",
        "Mr. Kinzie decided to take with him but two men: Plante and Pierre\nRoy,–the former to act as guide, on the assurance that he knew every\nmile of the way, from the Portage to Ogie’s Ferry, and from Ogie’s Ferry\nto Chicago.",
        "The claims of the different saddle-horses were discussed, and the most\neligible one was selected for my use. We hesitated for a time between\n“Le Gris” and “Souris,” two much-vaunted animals, belonging to Paquette,\nthe interpreter. At length, being determined, like most of my sex, by a\nregard for exterior, I chose “Le Gris,” and “Souris” was assigned to\nyoung Roy; my own little stumpy pony, “Brunet,” being pronounced just\nthe thing for a pack-saddle. My husband rode his own bay horse “Tom,\"\nwhile Plante, the gayest and proudest of the party, bestrode a fine,\nlarge animal called “Jerry,” which had lately been purchased for my use;\nand thus was our cortége complete.",
