        "In such compelling circumstances as these, necessity became the\nmother of achievement. There is nothing finer in American history\nthan the dogged fortitude and high-hearted endeavor with which\nthe merchant seamen returned to their work after the Revolution\nand sought and found new markets for their wares. It was then\nthat Salem played that conspicuous part which was, for a\ngeneration, to overshadow the activities of all other American\nseaports. Six thousand privateersmen had signed articles in her\ntaverns, as many as the total population of the town, and they\nfilled it with a spirit of enterprise and daring. Not for them\nthe stupid monotony of voyages coastwise if more hazardous\nventures beckoned and there were havens and islands unvexed by\ntrade where bold men might win profit and perhaps fight for life\nand cargo.",
        "Now there dwelt in Salem one of the great men of his time, Elias\nHasket Derby, the first American millionaire, and very much more\nthan this. He was a shipping merchant with a vision and with the\nhard-headed sagacity to make his dreams come true. His was a\nnotable seafaring family, to begin with. His father, Captain\nRichard Derby, born in 1712, had dispatched his small vessels to\nthe West Indies and Virginia and with the returns from these\nvoyages he had loaded assorted cargoes for Spain and Madeira and\nhad the proceeds remitted in bills of exchange to London or in\nwine, salt, fruit, oil, lead, and handkerchiefs to America.\nRichard Derby’s vessels had eluded or banged away at the\nprivateers during the French War from 1756 to 1763, mounting from\neight to twelve guns, “with four cannon below decks for close\nquarters.” Of such a temper was this old sea-dog who led the\nmilitia and defiantly halted General Gage’s regulars at the North\nRiver bridge in Salem, two full months before the skirmish at\nLexington. Eight of the nineteen cannon which it was proposed to\nseize from the patriots had been taken from the ships of Captain\nRichard Derby and stored in his warehouse for the use of the\nProvincial Congress.",
        "It was Richard’s son, Captain John Derby, who carried to England\nin the swift schooner Quero the first news of the affair at\nLexington, ahead of the King’s messenger. A sensational arrival,\nif ever there was one! This Salem shipmaster, cracking on sail\nlike a proper son of his sire, making the passage in twenty-nine\ndays and handsomely beating the lubberly Royal Express Packet\nSukey which left Boston four days sooner, and startling the\nBritish nation with the tidings which meant the loss of an\nAmerican empire! A singular coincidence was that this same\nCaptain John Derby should have been the first mariner to inform\nthe United States that peace had come, when he arrived from\nFrance in 1783 with the message that a treaty had been signed.",
        "Elias Hasket Derby was another son of Richard. When his manifold\nenergies were crippled by the war, he diverted his ability and\nabundant resources into privateering. He was interested in at\nleast eighty of the privateers out of Salem, invariably\nsubscribing for such shares as might not be taken up by his\nfellow-townsmen. He soon perceived that many of these craft were\nwretchedly unfit for the purpose and were easily captured or\nwrecked. It was characteristic of his genius that he should\nestablish shipyards of his own, turn his attention to naval\narchitecture, and begin to build a class of vessels vastly\nsuperior in size, model, and speed to any previously launched in\nthe colonies. They were designed to meet the small cruiser of the\nBritish Navy on even terms and were remarkably successful, both\nin enriching their owner and in defying the enemy.",
        "At the end of the war Elias Hasket Derby discovered that these\nfine ships were too large and costly to ply up and down the\ncoast. Instead of bewailing his hard lot, he resolved to send\nthem to the other side of the globe. At a time when the British\nand the Dutch East India companies insolently claimed a monopoly\nof the trade of the Orient, when American merchant seamen had\nnever ventured beyond the two Atlantics, this was a conception\nwhich made of commerce a surpassing romance and heralded the\ngolden era of the nation’s life upon the sea.",
        "His Grand Turk of three hundred tons was promptly fitted out for\na pioneering voyage as far as the Cape of Good Hope. Salem knew\nher as “the great ship” and yet her hull was not quite one\nhundred feet long. Safely Captain Jonathan Ingersoll took her out\nover the long road, his navigating equipment consisting of a few\nerroneous maps and charts, a sextant, and Guthrie’s Geographical\nGrammar. In Table Bay he sold his cargo of provisions and then\nvisited the coast of Guinea to dispose of his rum for ivory and\ngold dust but brought not a single slave back, Mr. Derby having\ndeclared that “he would rather sink the whole capital employed\nthan directly or indirectly be concerned in so infamous a\ntrade\"--an unusual point of view for a shipping merchant of New\nEngland in 1784!",
        "Derby ships were first to go to Mauritius, then called the Isle\nof France, first at Calcutta, and among the earliest to swing at\nanchor off Canton. When Elias Hasket Derby decided to invade this\nrich East India commerce, he sent his eldest son, Elias Hasket,\nJr., to England and the Continent after a course at Harvard. The\nyoung man became a linguist and made a thorough study of English\nand French methods of trade. Having laid this foundation for the\nventure, the son was now sent to India, where he lived for three\nyears in the interests of his house, building up a trade almost\nfabulously profitable.",
        "How fortunes were won in those stirring days may be discerned\nfrom the record of young Derby’s ventures while in the Orient. In\n1788 the proceeds of one cargo enabled him to buy a ship and a\nbrigantine in the Isle of France. These two vessels he sent to\nBombay to load with cotton. Two other ships of his fleet, the\nAstrea and Light Horse, were filled at Calcutta and Rangoon and\nordered to Salem. It was found, when the profits of these\ntransactions were reckoned, that the little squadron had earned\n$100,000 above all outlay.",
        "To carry on such a business as this enlisted many men and\nindustries. While the larger ships were making their distant\nvoyages, the brigs and schooners were gathering cargoes for\nthem, crossing to Gothenburg and St. Petersburg for iron, duck,\nand hemp, to France, Spain, and Madeira for wine and lead, to the\nFrench West Indies for molasses to be turned into rum, to New\nYork, Philadelphia, and Richmond for flour, provisions, and\ntobacco. These shipments were assembled in the warehouses on\nDerby Wharf and paid for the teas, coffees, pepper, muslin,\nsilks, and ivory which the ships from the Far East were fetching\nhome. In fourteen years the Derby ships made one hundred and\ntwenty-five voyages to Europe and far eastern ports and out of\nthe thirty-five vessels engaged only one was lost at sea.",
        "It was in 1785 when the Grand Turk, on a second voyage, brought\nback a cargo of silks, teas, and nankeens from Batavia and China,\nthat “The Independent Chronicle” of London, unconsciously\nhumorous, was moved to affirm that “the Americans have given up\nall thought of a China trade which can never be carried on to\nadvantage without some settlement in the East Indies.”",
        "As soon as these new sea-trails had been furrowed by the keels of\nElias Hasket Derby, other Salem merchants were quick to follow in\na rivalry which left no sea unexplored for virgin markets and\nwhich ransacked every nook and corner of barbarism which had a\nshore. Vessels slipped their cables and sailed away by night for\nsome secret destination with whose savage potentate trade\nrelations had been established. It might be Captain Jonathan\nCarnes who, while at the port of Bencoolen in 1793, heard that\npepper grew wild on the northern coast of Sumatra. He whispered\nthe word to the Salem owner, who sent him back in the schooner\nRajah with only four guns and ten men. Eighteen months later,\nJonathan Carnes returned to Salem with a cargo of pepper in bulk,\nthe first direct importation, and cleared seven hundred per cent\non the voyage. When he made ready to go again, keeping his\nbusiness strictly to himself, other owners tracked him clear to\nBencoolen, but there he vanished in the Rajah, and his secret with\nhim, until he reappeared with another precious cargo of pepper.\nWhen, at length, he shared this trade with other vessels, it\nmeant that Salem controlled the pepper market of Sumatra and for\nmany years supplied a large part of the world’s demand.",
        "And so it happened that in the spicy warehouses that overlooked\nSalem Harbor there came to be stored hemp from Luzon, gum copal\nfrom Zanzibar, palm oil from Africa, coffee from Arabia, tallow\nfrom Madagascar, whale oil from the Antarctic, hides and wool\nfrom the Rio de la Plata, nutmeg and cloves from Malaysia. Such\nmerchandise had been bought or bartered for by shipmasters who\nwere much more than mere navigators. They had to be shrewd\nmerchants on their own accounts, for the success or failure of a\nvoyage was mostly in their hands. Carefully trained and highly\nintelligent men, they attained command in the early twenties and\nwere able to retire, after a few years more afloat, to own ships\nand exchange the quarterdeck for the counting-room, and the cabin\nfor the solid mansion and lawn on Derby Street. Every\nopportunity, indeed, was offered them to advance their own\nfortunes. They sailed not for wages but for handsome commissions\nand privileges--in the Derby ships, five per cent of a cargo\noutward bound, two and a half per cent of the freightage home,\nfive per cent profit on goods bought and sold between foreign\nports, and five per cent of the cargo space for their own use.",
        "Such was the system which persuaded the pick and flower of young\nAmerican manhood to choose the sea as the most advantageous\ncareer possible. There was the Crowninshield family, for example,\nwith five brothers all in command of ships before they were old\nenough to vote and at one time all five away from Salem, each in\nhis own vessel and three of them in the East India trade. “When\nlittle boys,” to quote from the memoirs of Benjamin\nCrowninshield, “they were all sent to a common school and about\ntheir eleventh year began their first particular study which\nshould develop them as sailors and ship captains. These boys\nstudied their navigation as little chaps of twelve years old and\nwere required to thoroughly master the subject before being sent\nto sea . . . . As soon as the art of navigation was mastered, the\nyoungsters were sent to sea, sometimes as common sailors but\ncommonly as ship’s clerks, in which position they were able to\nlearn everything about the management of a ship without actually\nbeing a common sailor.”",
        "This was the practice in families of solid station and social\nrank, for to be a shipmaster was to follow the profession of a\ngentleman. Yet the bright lad who entered by way of the\nforecastle also played for high stakes. Soon promoted to the\nberth of mate, he was granted cargo space for his own adventures\nin merchandise and a share of the profits. In these days the\nyouth of twenty-one is likely to be a college undergraduate,\nrated too callow and unfit to be intrusted with the smallest\nbusiness responsibilities and tolerantly regarded as unable to\ntake care of himself. It provokes both a smile and a glow of\npride, therefore, to recall those seasoned striplings and what\nthey did.",
        "No unusual instance was that of Nathaniel Silsbee, later United\nStates Senator from Massachusetts, who took command of the new\nship Benjamin in the year 1792, laden with a costly cargo from\nSalem for the Cape of Good Hope and India, “with such\ninstructions,” says he, “as left the management of the voyage\nvery much to my own discretion. Neither myself nor the chief\nmate, Mr. Charles Derby, had attained the age of twenty-one years\nwhen we left home. I was not then twenty.” This reminded him to\nspeak of his own family. Of the three Silsbee brothers, “each of\nus obtained the command of vessels and the consignment of their\ncargoes before attaining the age of twenty years, viz., myself at\nthe age of eighteen and a half, my brother William at nineteen\nand a half, and my brother Zachariah before he was twenty years\nold. Each and all of us left off going to sea before reaching the\nage of twenty-nine years.”",
        "How resourcefully these children of the sea could handle affairs\nwas shown in this voyage of the Benjamin. While in the Indian\nOcean young Silsbee fell in with a frigate which gave him news of\nthe beginning of war between England and France. He shifted his\ncourse for Mauritius and there sold the cargo for a dazzling\nprice in paper dollars, which he turned into Spanish silver. An\nembargo detained him for six months, during which this currency\nincreased to three times the value of the paper money. He gave up\nthe voyage to Calcutta, sold the Spanish dollars and loaded with\ncoffee and spices for Salem. At the Cape of Good Hope, however,\nhe discovered that he could earn a pretty penny by sending his\ncargo home in other ships and loading the Benjamin again for\nMauritius. When, at length, he arrived in Salem harbor, after\nnineteen months away, his enterprises had reaped a hundred per\ncent for Elias Hasket Derby and his own share was the snug little\nfortune of four thousand dollars. Part of this he, of course,\ninvested at sea, and at twenty-two he was part owner of the\nBetsy, East Indiaman, and on the road to independence.",
        "As second mate in the Benjamin had sailed Richard Cleveland,\nanother matured mariner of nineteen, who crowded into one life an\nOdyssey of adventure noteworthy even in that era and who had the\nknack of writing about it with rare skill and spirit. In 1797,\nwhen twenty-three years old, he was master of the bark Enterprise\nbound from Salem to Mocha for coffee. The voyage was abandoned at\nHavre and he sent the mate home with the ship, deciding to remain\nabroad and gamble for himself with the chances of the sea. In\nFrance he bought on credit a “cutter-sloop” of forty-three tons,\nno larger than the yachts whose owners think it venturesome to\ntake them off soundings in summer cruises. In this little box of\na craft he planned to carry a cargo of merchandise to the Cape of\nGood Hope and thence to Mauritius.",
        "His crew included two men, a black cook, and a brace of boys who\nwere hastily shipped at Havre. “Fortunately they were all so much\nin debt as not to want any time to spend their advance, but were\nready at the instant, and with this motley crew, (who, for aught\nI knew, were robbers or pirates) I put to sea.” The only sailor\nof the lot was a Nantucket lad who was made mate and had to be\ntaught the rudiments of navigation while at sea. Of the others he\nhad this to say, in his lighthearted manner:",
        "“The first of my fore-mast hands is a great, surly, crabbed,\nraw-boned, ignorant Prussian who is so timid aloft that the mate\nhas frequently been obliged to do his duty there. I believe him\nto be more of a soldier than a sailor, though he has often\nassured me that he has been a boatswain’s mate of a Dutch\nIndiaman, which I do not believe as he hardly knows how to put\ntwo ends of a rope together .... My cook . . . a good-natured\nnegro and a tolerable cook, so unused to a vessel that in the\nsmoothest weather he cannot walk fore and aft without holding\nonto something with both hands. This fear proceeds from the fact\nthat he is so tall and slim that if he should get a cant it might\nbe fatal to him. I did not think America could furnish such a\nspecimen of the negro race . . . nor did I ever see such a\nsimpleton. It is impossible to teach him anything and . . . he\ncan hardly tell the main-halliards from the mainstay.",
        "“Next is an English boy of seventeen years old, who from having\nlately had the small-pox is feeble and almost blind, a miserable\nobject, but pity for his misfortunes induces me to make his duty\nas easy as possible. Finally I have a little ugly French boy, the\nvery image of a baboon, who from having served for some time on\ndifferent privateers has all the tricks of a veteran man-of-war’s\nman, though only thirteen years old, and by having been in an\nEnglish prison, has learned enough of the language to be a\nproficient in swearing.”",
        "With these human scrapings for a ship’s company, the cutter\nCaroline was three months on her solitary way as far as the Cape\nof Good Hope, where the inhabitants “could not disguise their\nastonishment at the size of the vessel, the boyish appearance of\nthe master and mate, and the queer and unique characters of the\ntwo men and boy who composed the crew.” The English officials\nthought it strange indeed, suspecting some scheme of French spies\nor smuggled dispatches, but Richard Cleveland’s petition to the\nGovernor, Lord McCartney, ingenuously patterned after certain\nletters addressed to noblemen as found in an old magazine aboard\nhis vessel, won the day for him and he was permitted to sell the\ncutter and her cargo, having changed his mind about proceeding\nfarther.",
        "Taking passage to Batavia, he looked about for another venture\nbut found nothing to his liking and wandered on to Canton, where\nhe was attracted by the prospect of a voyage to the northwest\ncoast of America to buy furs from the Indians. In a cutter no\nlarger than the Caroline he risked all his cash and credit,\nstocking her with $20,000 worth of assorted merchandise for\nbarter, and put out across the Pacific, “having on board\ntwenty-one persons, consisting, except two Americans, of English,\nIrish, Swedes and French, but principally the first, who were\nrunaways from the men-of-war and Indiamen, and two from a Botany\nBay ship who had made their escape, for we were obliged to take\nsuch as we could get, served to complete a list of as\naccomplished villains as ever disgraced any country.”",
        "After a month of weary, drenching hardship off the China coast,\nthis crew of cutthroats mutinied. With a loyal handful, including\nthe black cook, Cleveland locked up the provisions, mounted two\nfour-pounders on the quarterdeck, rammed them full of grape-shot,\nand fetched up the flint-lock muskets and pistols from the cabin.\nThe mutineers were then informed that if they poked their heads\nabove the hatches he would blow them overboard. Losing enthusiasm\nand weakened by hunger, they asked to be set ashore; so the\nskipper marooned the lot. For two days the cutter lay offshore\nwhile a truce was argued, the upshot being that four of the\nrascals gave in and the others were left behind.",
        "Fifty days more of it and, washed by icy seas, racked and\nstorm-beaten, the vessel made Norfolk Sound. So small was the\ncrew, so imminent the danger that the Indians might take her by\nboarding, that screens of hides were rigged along the bulwarks to\nhide the deck from view. Stranded and getting clear, warding off\nattacks, Captain Richard Cleveland stayed two months on the\nwilderness coast of Oregon, trading one musket for eight prime\nsea-otter skins until there was no more room below. Sixty\nthousand dollars was the value of the venture when he sailed for\nChina by way of the Sandwich Islands, forty thousand of profit,\nand he was twenty-five years old with the zest for roving\nundiminished.",
        "He next appeared in Calcutta, buying a twenty-five-ton pilot boat\nunder the Danish flag for a fling at Mauritius and a speculation\nin prizes brought in by French privateers. Finding none in port,\nhe loaded seven thousand bags of coffee in a ship for Copenhagen\nand conveyed as a passenger a kindred spirit, young Nathaniel\nShaler, whom he took into partnership. At Hamburg these two\nbought a fast brig, the Lelia Byrd, to try their fortune on the\nwest coast of South America, and recruited a third partner, a\nboyish Polish nobleman, Count de Rousillon, who had been an aide\nto Kosciusko. Three seafaring musketeers, true gentlemen rovers,\nall under thirty, sailing out to beard the viceroys of Spain!",
        "From Valparaiso, where other American ships were detained and\nrobbed, they adroitly escaped and steered north to Mexico and\nCalifornia. At San Diego they fought their way out of the harbor,\nsilencing the Spanish fort with their six guns. Then to Canton\nwith furs, and Richard Cleveland went home at thirty years of age\nafter seven years’ absence and voyaging twice around the world,\nhaving wrested success from almost every imaginable danger and\nobstacle, with $70,000 to make him a rich man in his own town. He\nwas neither more nor less than an American sailor of the kind\nthat made the old merchant marine magnificent.",
        "It was true romance, also, when the first American shipmasters\nset foot in mysterious Japan, a half century before Perry’s\nsquadron shattered the immemorial isolation of the land of the\nShoguns and the Samurai. Only the Dutch had been permitted to\nhold any foreign intercourse whatever with this hermit nation and\nfor two centuries they had maintained their singular commercial\nmonopoly at a price measured in terms of the deepest degradation\nof dignity and respect. The few Dutch merchants suffered to\nreside in Japan were restricted to a small island in Nagasaki\nharbor, leaving it only once in four years when the Resident, or\nchief agent, journeyed to Yeddo to offer gifts and most humble\nobeisance to the Shogun, “creeping forward on his hands and feet,\nand falling on his knees, bowed his head to the ground, and\nretired again in absolute silence, crawling exactly like a crab,\"\nsaid one of these pilgrims who added: “We may not keep Sundays or\nfast days, or allow our spiritual hymns or prayers to be heard;\nnever mention the name of Christ. Besides these things, we have\nto submit to other insulting imputations which are always painful\nto a noble heart. The reason which impels the Dutch to bear all\nthese sufferings so patiently is simply the love of gain.”",
        "In return for these humiliations the Dutch East India Company was\npermitted to send one or two ships a year from Batavia to Japan\nand to export copper, silk, gold, camphor, porcelain, bronze, and\nrare woods. The American ship Franklin arrived at Batavia in 1799\nand Captain James Devereux of Salem learned that a charter was\noffered for one of these annual voyages. After a deal of Yankee\ndickering with the hard-headed Dutchmen, a bargain was struck and\nthe Franklin sailed for Nagasaki with cloves, chintz, sugar, tin,\nblack pepper, sapan wood, and elephants’ teeth. The instructions\nwere elaborate and punctilious, salutes to be fired right and\nleft, nine guns for the Emperor’s guard while passing in,\nthirteen guns at the anchorage; all books on board to be sealed\nup in a cask, Bibles in particular, and turned over to the\nJapanese officials, all firearms sent ashore, ship dressed with\ncolors whenever the “Commissaries of the Chief” graciously came\naboard, and a carpet on deck for them to sit upon.",
        "Two years later, the Margaret of Salem made the same sort of a\nvoyage, and in both instances the supercargoes, one of whom\nhappened to be a younger brother of Captain Richard Cleveland,\nwrote journals of the extraordinary episode. For these mariners\nalone was the curtain lifted which concealed the feudal Japan\nfrom the eyes of the civilized world. Alert and curious, these\nYankee traders explored the narrow streets of Nagasaki, visited\ntemples, were handsomely entertained by officers and merchants,\nand exchanged their wares in the marketplace. They were as much\nat home, no doubt, as when buying piculs of pepper from a rajah\nof Qualah Battoo, or dining with an elderly mandarin of Cochin\nChina. It was not too much to say that “the profuse stores of\nknowledge brought by every ship’s crew, together with unheard of\ncuriosities from every savage shore, gave the community of Salem\na rare alertness of intellect.”",
        "It was a Salem bark, the Lydia, that first displayed the American\nflag to the natives of Guam in 1801. She was chartered by the\nSpanish government of Manila to carry to the Marianne Islands, as\nthose dots on the chart of the Pacific were then called, the new\nGovernor, his family, his suite, and his luggage. First Mate\nWilliam Haswell kept a diary in a most conscientious fashion, and\nhere and there one gleans an item with a humor of its own. “Now\nhaving to pass through dangerous straits,” he observes, “we went\nto work to make boarding nettings and to get our arms in the best\norder, but had we been attacked we should have been taken with\nease. Between Panay and Negros all the passengers were in the\ngreatest confusion for fear of being taken  and put to death in\nthe dark and not have time to say their prayers.”",
        "The decks were in confusion most of the time, what with the\nGovernor, his lady, three children, two servant girls and twelve\nmen servants, a friar and his servant, a judge and two servants,\nnot to mention some small hogs, two sheep, an ox, and a goat to\nfeed the passengers who were too dainty for sea provender. The\nfriar was an interesting character. A great pity that the worthy\nmate of the Lydia should not have been more explicit! It\nintrigues the reader of his manuscript diary to be told that “the\nFriar was praying night and day but it would not bring a fair\nwind. His behavior was so bad that we were forced to send him to\nCoventry, or in other words, no one would speak to him.”",
        "The Spanish governors of Guam had in operation an economic system\nwhich compelled the admiration of this thrifty Yankee mate. The\nnatives wore very few clothes, he concluded, because the Governor\nwas the only shopkeeper and he insisted on a profit of at least\neight hundred per cent. There was a native militia regiment of a\nthousand men who were paid ten dollars a year. With this cash\nthey bought Bengal goods, cottons, Chinese pans, pots, knives,\nand hoes at the Governor’s store, so that “all this money never\nleft the Governor’s hands. It was fetched to him by the galleons\nin passing, and when he was relieved he carried it with him to\nManila, often to the amount of eighty or ninety thousand\ndollars.” A glimpse of high finance without a flaw!",
        "There is pathos, simple and moving, in the stories of shipwreck\nand stranding on hostile or desert coasts. These disasters were\nfar more frequent then than now, because navigation was partly\nguesswork and ships were very small. Among these tragedies was\nthat of the Commerce, bound from Boston to Bombay in 1793. The\ncaptain lost his bearings and thought he was off Malabar when the\nship piled up on the beach in the night. The nearest port was\nMuscat and the crew took to the boats in the hope of reaching it.\nStormy weather drove them ashore where armed Arabs on camels\nstripped them of clothes and stores and left them to die among\nthe sand dunes.",
        "On foot they trudged day after day in the direction of Muscat,\nand how they suffered and what they endured was told by one of\nthe survivors, young Daniel Saunders. Soon they began to drop out\nand die in their tracks in the manner of “Benjamin Williams,\nWilliam Leghorn, and Thomas Barnard whose bodies were exposed\nnaked to the scorching sun and finding their strength and spirits\nquite exhausted they lay down expecting nothing but death for\nrelief.” The next to be left behind was Mr. Robert Williams,\nmerchant and part owner, “and we therefore with reluctance\nabandoned him to the mercy of God, suffering ourselves all the\nhorrors that fill the mind at the approach of death.” Near the\nbeach and a forlorn little oasis, they stumbled across Charles\nLapham, who had become separated from them. He had been without\nwater for five days “and after many efforts he got upon his feet\nand endeavored to walk. Seeing him in so wretched a condition I\ncould not but sympathize enough with him in his torments to go\nback with him” toward water two miles away, “which both my other\ncompanions refused to do. Accordingly they walked forward while I\nwent back a considerable distance with Lapham until, his strength\nfailing him, he suddenly fell on the ground, nor was he able to\nrise again or even speak to me. Finding it vain to stay with him,\nI covered him with sprays and leaves which I tore from an\nadjacent tree, it being the last friendly office I could do him.”",
        "Eight living skeletons left of eighteen strong seamen tottered\ninto Muscat and were cared for by the English consul. Daniel\nSaunders worked his passage to England, was picked up by a\npress-gang, escaped, and so returned to Salem. It was the fate of\nJuba Hill, the black cook from Boston, to be detained among the\nArabs as a slave. It is worth noting that a black sea-cook\nfigured in many of these tales of daring and disaster, and among\nthem was the heroic and amazing figure of one Peter Jackson who\nbelonged in the brig Ceres. While running down the river from\nCalcutta she was thrown on her beam ends and Peter, perhaps\ndumping garbage over the rail, took a header. Among the things\ntossed to him as he floated away was a sail-boom on which he was\nswiftly carried out of sight by the turbid current. All on board\nconcluded that Peter Jackson had been eaten by sharks or\ncrocodiles and it was so reported when they arrived home. An\nadministrator was appointed for his goods and chattels and he was\nofficially deceased in the eyes of the law. A year or so later\nthis unconquerable sea-cook appeared in the streets of Salem,\ngrinning a welcome to former shipmates who fled from him in\nterror as a ghostly visitation. He had floated twelve hours on\nhis sail-boom, it seemed, fighting off the sharks with his feet;\nand finally drifting ashore. “He had hard work to do away with\nthe impressions of being dead,” runs the old account, “but\nsucceeded and was allowed the rights and privileges of the\nliving.”",
        "The community of interests in these voyages of long ago included\nnot only the ship’s company but also the townspeople, even the\nboys and girls, who entrusted their little private speculations\nor “adventures” to the captain. It was a custom which flourished\nwell into the nineteenth century. These memoranda are sprinkled\nthrough the account books of the East Indiamen out of Salem and\nBoston. It might be Miss Harriet Elkins who requested the master\nof the Messenger “please to purchase at Calcutta two net beads\nwith draperies; if at Batavia or any spice market, nutmegs or\nmace; or if at Canton, two Canton shawls of the enclosed colors\nat $5 per shawl. Enclosed is $10.”",
        "Again, it might be Mr. John R. Tucker who ventured in the same\nship one hundred Spanish dollars to be invested in coffee and\nsugar, or Captain Nathaniel West who risked in the Astrea fifteen\nboxes of spermaceti candles and a pipe of Teneriffe wine. It is\ninteresting to discover what was done with Mr. Tucker’s hundred\nSpanish dollars, as invested for him by the skipper of the\nMessenger at Batavia and duly accounted for. Ten bags of coffee\nwere bought for $83.30, the extra expenses of duty, boat-hire,\nand sacking bringing the total outlay to $90.19. The coffee was\nsold at Antwerp on the way home for $183.75, and Mr. Tucker’s\nhandsome profit on the adventure was therefore $93.56, or more\nthan one hundred per cent.",
        "It was all a grand adventure, in fact, and the word was aptly\nchosen to fit this ocean trade. The merchant freighted his ship\nand sent her out to vanish from his ken for months and months of\nwaiting, with the greater part of his savings, perhaps, in goods\nand specie beneath her hatches. No cable messages kept him in\ntouch with her nor were there frequent letters from the master.\nNot until her signal was displayed by the fluttering flags of the\nheadland station at the harbor mouth could he know whether he had\ngained or lost a fortune. The spirit of such merchants was\nadmirably typified in the last venture of Elias Hasket Derby in\n1798, when unofficial war existed between the United States and\nFrance.",
        "American ships were everywhere seeking refuge from the privateers\nunder the tricolor, which fairly ran amuck in the routes of\ntrade. For this reason it meant a rich reward to land a cargo\nabroad. The ship Mount Vernon, commanded by Captain Elias Hasket\nDerby, Jr., was laden with sugar and coffee for Mediterranean\nports, and was prepared for trouble, with twenty guns mounted and\nfifty men to handle them. A smart ship and a powerful one, she\nraced across to Cape Saint Vincent in sixteen days, which was\nclipper speed. She ran into a French fleet of sixty sail,\nexchanged broadsides with the nearest, and showed her stern to\nthe others.",
        "“We arrived at 12 o’clock [wrote Captain Derby from Gibraltar]\npopping at Frenchmen all the forenoon. At 10 A.M. off Algeciras\nPoint we were seriously attacked by a large latineer who had on\nboard more than one hundred men. He came so near our broadside as\nto allow our six-pound grape to do execution handsomely. We then\nbore away and gave him our stern guns in a cool and deliberate\nmanner, doing apparently great execution. Our bars having cut his\nsails considerably, he was thrown into confusion, struck both his\nensign and his pennant. I was then puzzled to know what to do\nwith so many men; our ship was running large with all her\nsteering sails out, so that we could not immediately bring her to\nthe wind, and we were directly off Algeciras Point from whence I\nhad reason to fear she might receive assistance, and my port\nGibraltar in full view. These were circumstances that induced me\nto give up the gratification of bringing him in. It was, however,\na satisfaction to flog the rascal in full view of the English\nfleet who were to leeward.”",
