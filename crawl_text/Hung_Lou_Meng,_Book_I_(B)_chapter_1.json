        "  In honour of Chia Ching’s birthday, a family banquet is spread in the\n      Ning Mansion.\n  At the sight of Hsi-feng, Chia Jui entertains feelings of licentious\n      love.",
        "We will now explain, in continuation of our story, that on the day of\nChia Ching’s birthday, Chia Chen began by getting ready luscious\ndelicacies and rare fruits, which he packed in sixteen spacious present\nboxes, and bade Chia Jung take them, along with the servants belonging\nto the household, over to Chia Ching.",
        "Turning round towards Chia Jung: “Mind,” he said, “that you observe\nwhether your grandfather be agreeable or not, before you set to work and\npay your obeisance! ’My father,’ tell him, ’has complied with your\ndirections, venerable senior, and not presumed to come over; but he has\nat home ushered the whole company of the members of the family (into\nyour apartments), where they all paid their homage facing the side of\nhonour.’”",
        "After Chia Jung had listened to these injunctions, he speedily led off\nthe family domestics, and took his departure. During this interval, one\nby one arrived the guests. First came Chia Lien and Chia Se, who went to\nsee whether the seats in the various places (were sufficient). “Is there\nto be any entertainment or not?” they also inquired.",
        "“Our master,” replied the servants, “had, at one time, intended to\ninvite the venerable Mr. Chia Ching to come and spend this day at home,\nand hadn’t for this reason presumed to get up any entertainment. But\nwhen the other day he came to hear that the old gentleman was not\ncoming, he at once gave us orders to go in search of a troupe of young\nactors, as well as a band of musicians, and all these people are now\nengaged making their preparations on the stage in the garden.”",
        "Next came, in a group, mesdames Hsing and Wang, lady Feng and Pao-yü,\nfollowed immediately after by Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu; Mrs. Yu’s mother\nhaving already arrived and being in there in advance of her. Salutations\nwere exchanged between the whole company, and they pressed one another\nto take a seat. Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu both handed the tea round.",
        "“Our venerable lady,” they explained, as they smiled, “is a worthy\nsenior; while our father is, on the other hand, only her nephew; so that\non a birthday of a man of his age, we should really not have had the\naudacity to invite her ladyship; but as the weather, at this time, is\ncool, and the chrysanthemums, in the whole garden, are in luxuriant\nblossom, we have requested our venerable ancestor to come for a little\ndistraction, and to see the whole number of her children and\ngrand-children amuse themselves. This was the object we had in view,\nbut, contrary to our expectations, our worthy senior has not again\nconferred upon us the lustre of her countenance.”",
        "Lady Feng did not wait until madame Wang could open her mouth, but took\nthe initiative to reply. “Our venerable lady,” she urged, “had, even so\nlate as yesterday, said that she meant to come; but, in the evening,\nupon seeing brother Pao eating peaches, the mouth of the old lady once\nagain began to water, and after partaking of a little more than the half\nof one, she had, about the fifth watch, to get out of bed two\nconsecutive times, with the result that all the forenoon to-day, she\nfelt her body considerably worn out. She therefore bade me inform our\nworthy senior that it was utterly impossible for her to come to-day;\nadding however that, if there were any delicacies, she fancied a few\nkinds, but that they should be very tender.”",
        "When Chia Chen heard these words, he smiled. “Our dowager lady,” he\nreplied, “is, I argued, so fond of amusement that, if she doesn’t come\nto-day, there must, for a certainty, be some valid reason; and that’s\nexactly what happens to be the case.”",
        "“The other day I heard your eldest sister explain,” interposed madame\nWang, “that Chia Jung’s wife was anything but well; but what’s after all\nthe matter with her?”",
        "“She has,” observed Mrs. Yu, “contracted this illness verily in a\nstrange manner! Last moon at the time of the mid-autumn festival, she\nwas still well enough to be able to enjoy herself, during half the\nnight, in company with our dowager lady and madame Wang. On her return,\nshe continued in good health, until after the twentieth, when she began\nto feel more and more languid every day, and loth, likewise, to eat\nanything; and this has been going on for well-nigh half a month and\nmore; she hasn’t besides been anything like her old self for two\nmonths.”",
        "“May she not,” remarked madame Hsing, taking up the thread of the\nconversation, “be ailing for some happy event?”",
        "But while she was uttering these words, some one from outside announced:\n“Our senior master, second master and all the gentlemen of the family\nhave come, and are standing in the Reception Hall!” Whereupon Chia Chen\nand Chia Lien quitted the apartment with hurried step; and during this\nwhile, Mrs. Yu reiterated how that some time ago a doctor had also\nexpressed the opinion that she was ailing for a happy event, but that\nthe previous day, had come a doctor, recommended by Feng Tzu-ying–a\ndoctor, who had from his youth up made medicine his study, and was very\nproficient in the treatment of diseases,–who asserted, after he had\nseen her, that it was no felicitous ailment, but that it was some grave\ncomplaint. “It was only yesterday,” (she explained,) “that he wrote his\nprescription; and all she has had is but one dose, and already to-day\nthe giddiness in the head is considerably better; as regards the other\nsymptoms they have as yet shown no marked improvement.”",
        "“I maintain,” remarked lady Feng, “that, were she not quite unfit to\nstand the exertion, would she in fact, on a day like this, be unwilling\nto strain every nerve and come round.”",
        "“You saw her,” observed Mrs. Yu, “on the third in here; how that she\nbore up with a violent effort for ever so long, but it was all because\nof the friendship that exists between you two, that she still longed for\nyour society, and couldn’t brook the idea of tearing herself away.”",
        "When lady Feng heard these words, her eyes got quite red, and after a\ntime she at length exclaimed: “In the Heavens of a sudden come wind and\nrain; while with man, in a day and in a night, woe and weal survene! But\nwith her tender years, if for a complaint like this she were to run any\nrisk, what pleasure is there for any human being to be born and to\nsojourn in the world?”",
        "She was just speaking, when Chia Jung walked into the apartment; and\nafter paying his respects to madame Hsing, madame Wang, and lady Feng,\nhe then observed to Mrs. Yu: “I have just taken over the eatables to our\nvenerable ancestor; and, at the same time, I told him that my father was\nat home waiting upon the senior, and entertaining the junior gentlemen\nof the whole family, and that in compliance with grandfather’s orders,\nhe did not presume to go over. The old gentleman was much delighted by\nwhat he heard me say, and having signified that that was all in order,\nbade me tell father and you, mother, to do all you can in your\nattendance upon the senior gentlemen and ladies, enjoining me to\nentertain, with all propriety, my uncles, aunts, and my cousins. He also\nwent on to urge me to press the men to cut, with all despatch, the\nblocks for the Record of Meritorious Deeds, and to print ten thousand\ncopies for distribution. All these messages I have duly delivered to my\nfather, but I must now be quick and go out, so as to send the eatables\nfor the elder as well as for the younger gentlemen of the entire\nhousehold.”",
        "“Brother Jung Erh,” exclaimed lady Feng, “wait a moment. How is your\nwife getting on? how is she, after all, to-day?”",
        "“Not well,” replied Chia Jung. “But were you, aunt, on your return to go\nin and see her, you will find out for yourself.”",
        "Chia Jung forthwith left the room. During this interval, Mrs. Yu\naddressed herself to mesdames Hsing and Wang; “My ladies,” she asked,\n“will you have your repast in here, or will you go into the garden for\nit? There are now in the garden some young actors engaged in making\ntheir preparations?”",
        "“It’s better in here,” madame Wang remarked, as she turned towards\nmadame Hsing.",
        "Mrs. Yu thereupon issued directions to the married women and matrons to\nbe quick in serving the eatables. The servants, in waiting outside the\ndoor, with one voice signified their obedience; and each of them went\noff to fetch what fell to her share. In a short while, the courses were\nall laid out, and Mrs. Yu pressed mesdames Hsing and Wang, as well as\nher mother, into the upper seats; while she, together with lady Feng and\nPao-yü, sat at a side table.",
        "“We’ve come,” observed mesdames Hsing and Wang, “with the original idea\nof paying our congratulations to our venerable senior on the occasion of\nhis birthday; and isn’t this as if we had come for our own birthdays?”",
        "“The old gentleman,” answered lady Feng, “is a man fond of a quiet life;\nand as he has already consummated a process of purification, he may well\nbe looked upon as a supernatural being, so that the purpose to which\nyour ladyships have given expression may be considered as manifest to\nhis spirit, upon the very advent of the intention.”",
        "As this sentence was uttered the whole company in the room burst out\nlaughing. Mrs. Yu’s mother, mesdames Hsing and Wang, and lady Feng\nhaving one and all partaken of the banquet, rinsed their mouths and\nwashed their hands, which over, they expressed a wish to go into the\ngarden.",
        "Chia Jung entered the room. “The senior gentlemen,” he said to Mrs. Yu,\n“as well as all my uncles and cousins, have finished their repast; but\nthe elder gentleman Mr. Chia She, who excused himself on the score of\nhaving at home something to attend to, and Mr. Secundus (Chia Cheng),\nwho is not partial to theatrical performances and is always afraid that\npeople will be too boisterous in their entertainments, have both of them\ntaken their departure. The rest of the family gentlemen have been taken\nover by uncle Secundus Mr. Lien, and Mr. Se, to the other side to listen\nto the play. A few moments back Prince Nan An, Prince Tung P’ing, Prince\nHsi Ning, Prince Pei Ching, these four Princes, with Niu, Duke of Chen\nKuo, and five other dukes, six in all, and Shih, Marquis of Chung Ching,\nand other seven, in all eight marquises, sent their messengers with\ntheir cards and presents. I have already told father all about it; but\nbefore I did so, the presents were put away in the counting room, the\nlists of presents were all entered in the book, and the ’received with\nthanks’ cards were handed to the respective messengers of the various\nmansions; the men themselves were also tipped in the customary manner,\nand all of them were kept to have something to eat before they went on\ntheir way. But, mother, you should invite the two ladies, your mother\nand my aunt, to go over and sit in the garden.”",
        "“Just so!” observed Mrs. Yu, “but we’ve only now finished our repast,\nand were about to go over.”",
        "“I wish to tell you, madame,” interposed lady Feng, “that I shall go\nfirst and see brother Jung’s wife and then come and join you.”",
        "“All right,” replied madame Wang; “we should all have been fain to have\npaid her a visit, did we not fear lest she should look upon our\ndisturbing her with displeasure, but just tell her that we would like to\nknow how she is getting on!”",
        "“My dear sister,” remarked Mrs. Yu, “as our son’s wife has a ready ear\nfor all you say, do go and cheer her up, (and if you do so,) it will\nbesides set my own mind at ease; but be quick and come as soon as you\ncan into the garden.”",
        "Pao-yü being likewise desirous to go along with lady Feng to see lady\nCh’in, madame Wang remarked, “Go and see her just for a while, and then\ncome over at once into the garden; (for remember) she is your nephew’s\nwife, (and you couldn’t sit in there long).”",
        "Mrs. Yu forthwith invited mesdames Wang and Hsing, as well as her own\nmother, to adjourn to the other side, and they all in a body walked into\nthe garden of Concentrated Fragrance; while lady Feng and Pao-yü betook\nthemselves, in company with Chia Jung, over to this side.",
        "Having entered the door, they with quiet step walked as far as the\nentrance of the inner chamber. Mrs. Ch’in, upon catching sight of them,\nwas bent upon getting up; but “Be quick,” remonstrated lady Feng, “and\ngive up all idea of standing up; for take care your head will feel\ndizzy.”",
        "Lady Feng hastened to make a few hurried steps forward and to grasp Mrs.\nCh’in’s hand in hers. “My dear girl!” she exclaimed; “How is it that\nduring the few days I’ve not seen you, you have grown so thin?”",
        "Readily she then took a seat on the rug, on which Mrs. Ch’in was seated,\nwhile Pao-yü, after inquiring too about her health, sat in the chair on\nthe opposite side.",
        "“Bring the tea in at once,” called out Chia Jung, “for aunt and uncle\nSecundus have not had any tea in the drawing room.”",
        "Mrs. Ch’in took lady Feng’s hand in her own and forced a smile. “This is\nall due to my lack of good fortune; for in such a family as this, my\nfather and mother-in-law treat me just as if I were a daughter of their\nown flesh and blood! Besides, your nephew, (my husband,) may, it is\ntrue, my dear aunt, be young in years, but he is full of regard for me,\nas I have regard for him, and we have had so far no misunderstanding\nbetween us! In fact, among the senior generation, as well as that of the\nsame age as myself, in the whole clan, putting you aside, aunt, about\nwhom no mention need be made, there is not one who has not ever had\nanything but love for me, and not one who has not ever shown me anything\nbut kindness! But since I’ve fallen ill with this complaint, all my\nenergy has even every bit of it been taken out of me, so that I’ve been\nunable to show to my father and mother-in-law any mark of filial\nattention, yea so much as for one single day and to you, my dear aunt,\nwith all this affection of yours for me, I have every wish to be dutiful\nto the utmost degree, but, in my present state, I’m really not equal to\nit; my own idea is, that it isn’t likely that I shall last through this\nyear.”",
        "Pao-yü kept, while (she spoke,) his eyes fixed intently upon a picture\non the opposite side, representing some begonias drooping in the spring\ntime, and upon a pair of scrolls, with this inscription written by Ch’in\nTai-hsü:\r\r",
        "  A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man because the spring\n      is cold!\n  The fragrant whiff which wafts itself into man’s nose, is the perfume\n      of wine!",
        "And he could not help recalling to mind his experiences at the time when\nhe had fallen asleep in this apartment, and had, in his dream, visited\nthe confines of the Great Void. He was just plunged in a state of\nabstraction, when he heard Mrs. Ch’in give utterance to these\nsentiments, which pierced his heart as if they were ten thousand arrows,\n(with the result that) tears unwittingly trickled from his eyes.",
        "Lady Feng perceiving him in tears felt it extremely painful within\nherself to bear the sight; but she was on pins and needles lest the\npatient should detect their frame of mind, and feel, instead (of\nbenefit), still more sore at heart, which would not, after all, be quite\nthe purpose of her visit; which was to afford her distraction and\nconsolation. “Pao-yü,” she therefore exclaimed, “you are like an old\nwoman! Ill, as she is, simply makes her speak in this wise, and how ever\ncould things come to such a pass! Besides, she is young in years, so\nthat after a short indisposition, her illness will get all right!\"\n“Don’t,” she said as she turned towards Mrs. Ch’in, “give way to silly\nthoughts and idle ideas! for by so doing won’t you yourself be\naggravating your ailment?”",
        "“All that her sickness in fact needs,” observed Chia Jung, “is, that she\nshould be able to take something to eat, and then there will be nothing\nto fear.”",
        "“Brother Pao,” urged lady Feng, “your mother told you to go over, as\nsoon as you could, so that don’t stay here, and go on in the way you’re\ndoing, for you after all incite this lady also to feel uneasy at heart.\nBesides, your mother over there is solicitous on your account.” “You had\nbetter go ahead with your uncle Pao,” she consequently continued,\naddressing herself to Chia Jung, “while I sit here a little longer.”",
        "When Chia Jung heard this remark, he promptly crossed over with Pao-yü\ninto the garden of Concentrated Fragrance, while lady Feng went on both\nto cheer her up for a time, and to impart to her, in an undertone, a\ngood deal of confidential advice.",
        "Mrs. Yu had despatched servants, on two or three occasions, to hurry\nlady Feng, before she said to Mrs. Ch’in: “Do all you can to take good\ncare of yourself, and I’ll come and see you again. You’re bound to get\nover this illness; and now, in fact, that you’ve come across that\nrenowned doctor, you have really nothing more to fear.”",
        "“He might,” observed Mrs. Ch’in as she smiled, “even be a supernatural\nbeing and succeed in healing my disease, but he won’t be able to remedy\nmy destiny; for, my dear aunt, I feel sure that with this complaint of\nmine, I can do no more than drag on from day to day.”",
        "“If you encourage such ideas,” remonstrated lady Feng, “how can this\nillness ever get all right? What you absolutely need is to cast away all\nthese notions, and then you’ll improve. I hear moreover that the doctor\nasserts that if no cure be effected, the fear is of a change for the\nworse in spring, and not till then. Did you and I moreover belong to a\nfamily that hadn’t the means to afford any ginseng, it would be\ndifficult to say how we could manage to get it; but were your father and\nmother-in-law to hear that it’s good for your recovery, why not to speak\nof two mace of ginseng a day, but even two catties will be also within\ntheir means! So mind you do take every care of your health! I’m now off\non my way into the garden.”",
        "“Excuse me, my dear aunt,” added Mrs. Ch’in, “that I can’t go with you;\nbut when you have nothing to do, I entreat you do come over and see me!\nand you and I can sit and have a long chat.”",
        "After lady Feng had heard these words, her eyes unwillingly got quite\nred again. “When I’m at leisure I shall, of course,” she rejoined, “come\noften to see you;” and forthwith leading off the matrons and married\nwomen, who had come over with her, as well as the women and matrons of\nthe Ning mansion, she passed through the inner part of the house, and\nentered, by a circuitous way, the side gate of the park, when she\nperceived: yellow flowers covering the ground; white willows flanking\nthe slopes; diminutive bridges spanning streams, resembling the Jo Yeh;\nzigzag pathways (looking as if) they led to the steps of Heaven; limpid\nsprings dripping from among the rocks; flowers hanging from hedges\nemitting their fragrance, as they were flapped by the winds; red leaves\non the tree tops swaying to and fro; groves picture-like, half stripped\nof foliage; the western breeze coming with sudden gusts, and the wail of\nthe oriole still audible; the warm sun shining with genial rays, and the\ncicada also adding its chirp: structures, visible to the gaze at a\ndistance in the South-east, soaring high on various sites and resting\nagainst the hills; three halls, visible near by on the North-west,\nstretching in one connected line, on the bank of the stream; strains of\nmusic filling the pavilion, imbued with an unwonted subtle charm; and\nmaidens in fine attire penetrating the groves, lending an additional\nspell to the scene.",
        "Lady Feng, while engaged in contemplating the beauties of the spot,\nadvanced onwards step by step. She was plunged in a state of ecstasy,\nwhen suddenly, from the rear of the artificial rockery, egressed a\nperson, who approached her and facing her said, “My respects to you,\nsister-in-law.”",
        "Lady Feng was so startled by this unexpected appearance that she drew\nback. “Isn’t this Mr. Jui?” she ventured.",
        "“What! sister-in-law,” exclaimed Chia Jui, “don’t you recognise even\nme?”",
        "“It isn’t that I didn’t recognise you,” explained lady Feng, “but at the\nsudden sight of you, I couldn’t conceive that it would possibly be you,\nsir, in this place!”",
        "“This was in fact bound to be,” replied Chia Jui; “for there’s some\nsubtle sympathy between me and you, sister-in-law. Here I just\nstealthily leave the entertainment, in order to revel for a while in\nthis solitary place when, against every expectation, I come across you,\nsister-in-law; and isn’t this a subtle sympathy?”",
        "As he spoke, he kept his gaze fixed on lady Feng, who being an\nintelligent person, could not but arrive, at the sight of his manner, at\nthe whole truth in her surmises. “It isn’t to be wondered at,” she\nconsequently observed, as she smiled hypocritically, “that your eldest\nbrother should make frequent allusion to your qualities! for after\nseeing you on this occasion, and hearing you utter these few remarks, I\nhave readily discovered what an intelligent and genial person you are! I\nam just now on my way to join the ladies on the other side, and have no\nleisure to converse with you; but wait until I’ve nothing to attend to,\nwhen we can meet again.”",
        "“I meant to have gone over to your place and paid my respects to you,\nsister-in-law,” pleaded Chia Jui, “but I was afraid lest a person of\ntender years like yourself mightn’t lightly receive any visitors!”",
        "Lady Feng gave another sardonic smile. “Relatives,” she continued, “of\none family, as we are, what need is there to say anything of tender\nyears?”",
        "After Chia Jui had heard these words, he felt his heart swell within him\nwith such secret joy that he was urged to reflect: “I have at length\nto-day, when least I expected it, obtained this remarkable encounter\nwith her!”",
        "But as the display of his passion became still more repulsive, lady Feng\nurged him to go. “Be off at once,” she remarked, “and join the\nentertainment; for mind, if they find you out, they will mulct you in so\nmany glasses of wine!”",
        "By the time this suggestion had reached Chia Jui’s ears, half of his\nbody had become stiff like a log of wood; and as he betook himself away,\nwith lothful step, he turned his head round to cast glances at her. Lady\nFeng purposely slackened her pace; and when she perceived that he had\ngone a certain distance, she gave way to reflection. “This is indeed,\"\nshe thought, “knowing a person, as far as face goes, and not as heart!\nCan there be another such a beast as he! If he really continues to\nbehave in this manner, I shall soon enough compass his death, with my\nown hands, and he’ll then know what stuff I’m made of.”",
        "Lady Feng, at this juncture moved onward, and after turning round a\nchain of hillocks, she caught sight of two or three matrons coming along\nwith all speed. As soon as they espied lady Feng they put on a smile.\n“Our mistress,” they said, “perceiving that your ladyship was not\nforthcoming, has been in a great state of anxiety, and bade your\nservants come again to request you to come over.",
        "“Is your mistress,” observed lady Feng, “so like a quick-footed demon?”",
        "While lady Feng advanced leisurely, she inquired, “How many plays have\nbeen recited?” to which question one of the matrons replied, “They have\ngone through eight or nine.” But while engaged in conversation, they had\nalready reached the back door of the Tower of Celestial Fragrance, where\nshe caught sight of Pao-yü playing with a company of waiting-maids and\npages. “Brother Pao,” lady Feng exclaimed, “don’t be up to too much\nmischief!” “The ladies are all sitting upstairs,” interposed one of the\nmaids. “Please, my lady, this is the way up.”",
        "At these words lady Feng slackened her pace, raised her dress, and\nwalked up the stairs, where Mrs. Yu was already at the top of the\nlanding waiting for her.",
        "“You two,” remarked Mrs. Yu, smiling, “are so friendly, that having met\nyou couldn’t possibly tear yourself away to come. You had better\nto-morrow move over there and take up your quarters with her and have\ndone; but sit down and let me, first of all, present you a glass of\nwine.”",
        "Lady Feng speedily drew near mesdames Hsing and Wang, and begged\npermission to take a seat; while Mrs. Yu brought the programme, and\npressed lady Feng to mark some plays.",
        "“The senior ladies occupy the seats of honour,” remonstrated lady Feng,\n“and how can I presume to choose?”",
        "“We, and our relative by marriage, have selected several plays,\"\nexplained mesdames Hsing and Wang, “and it’s for you now to choose some\ngood ones for us to listen to.”",
        "Standing up, lady Feng signified her obedience; and taking over the\nprogramme, and perusing it from top to bottom, she marked off one\nentitled, the “Return of the Spirit,” and another called “Thrumming and\nSinging;” after which she handed back the programme, observing, “When\nthey have done with the ’Ennoblement of two Officers,’ which they are\nsinging just at present, it will be time enough to sing these two.”",
        "“Of course it will,” retorted madame Wang, “but they should get it over\nas soon as they can, so as to allow your elder Brother and your\nSister-in-law to have rest; besides, their hearts are not at ease.”",
        "“You senior ladies don’t come often,” expostulated Mrs. Yu, “and you and\nI will derive more enjoyment were we to stay a little longer; it’s as\nyet early in the day!”",
        "Lady Feng stood up and looked downstairs. “Where have all the gentlemen\ngone to?” she inquired.",
        "“The gentlemen have just gone over to the Pavilion of Plenteous\nEffulgence,” replied a matron, who stood by; “they have taken along with\nthem ten musicians and gone in there to drink their wine.”",
        "“It wasn’t convenient for them,” remarked lady Feng, “to be over here;\nbut who knows what they have again gone to do behind our backs?”",
        "“Could every one,” interposed Mrs. Yu, “resemble you, a person of such\npropriety!”",
        "While they indulged in chatting and laughing, the plays they had chosen\nwere all finished; whereupon the tables were cleared of the wines, and\nthe repast was served. The meal over, the whole company adjourned into\nthe garden, and came and sat in the drawing-room. After tea, they at\nlength gave orders to get ready the carriages, and they took their leave\nof Mrs. Yu’s mother. Mrs. Yu, attended by all the secondary wives,\nservants, and married women, escorted them out, while Chia Chen, along\nwith the whole bevy of young men, stood by the vehicles, waiting in a\ngroup for their arrival.",
        "After saluting mesdames Hsing and Wang, “Aunts,” they said, “you must\ncome over again to-morrow for a stroll.”",
        "“We must be excused,” observed madame Wang, “we’ve sat here the whole\nday to-day, and are, after all, feeling quite tired; besides, we shall\nneed to have some rest to-morrow.”",
        "Both of them thereupon got into their carriages and took their\ndeparture, while Chia Jui still kept a fixed gaze upon lady Feng; and it\nwas after Chia Chen had gone in that Li Kuei led round the horse, and\nthat Pao-yü mounted and went off, following in the track of mesdames\nHsing and Wang.",
        "Chia Chen and the whole number of brothers and nephews belonging to the\nfamily had, during this interval, partaken of their meal, and the whole\nparty at length broke up. But in like manner, all the inmates of the\nclan and the guests spent on the morrow another festive day, but we need\nnot advert to it with any minuteness.",
        "After this occasion, lady Feng came in person and paid frequent visits\nto Mrs. Ch’in; but as there were some days on which her ailment was\nconsiderably better, and others on which it was considerably worse, Chia\nChen, Mrs. Yu, and Chia Jung were in an awful state of anxiety.",
        "Chia Jui, it must moreover be noticed, came over, on several instances,\non a visit to the Jung mansion; but it invariably happened that he found\nthat lady Feng had gone over to the Ning mansion.",
        "This was just the thirtieth of the eleventh moon, the day on which the\nwinter solstice fell; and the few days preceding that season, dowager\nlady Chia, madame Wang and lady Feng did not let one day go by without\nsending some one to inquire about Mrs. Ch’in; and as the servants, on\ntheir return, repeatedly reported that, during the last few days,\nneither had her ailment aggravated, nor had it undergone any marked\nimprovement, madame Wang explained to dowager lady Chia, that as a\ncomplaint of this nature had reached this kind of season without getting\nany worse, there was some hope of recovery.",
        "“Of course there is!” observed the old lady; “what a dear child she is!\nshould anything happen to her, won’t it be enough to make people die\nfrom grief!” and as she spake she felt for a time quite sore at heart.\n“You and she,” continuing, she said to lady Feng, “have been friends for\never so long; to-morrow is the glorious first (and you can’t go), but\nafter to-morrow you should pay her a visit and minutely scrutinise her\nappearance: and should you find her any better, come and tell me on your\nreturn! Whatever things that dear child has all along a fancy for, do\nsend her round a few even as often as you can by some one or other!”",
        "Lady Feng assented to each of her recommendations; and when the second\narrived, she came, after breakfast, to the Ning mansion to see how Mrs.\nCh’in was getting on; and though she found her none the worse, the flesh\nall over her face and person had however become emaciated and parched\nup. She readily sat with Mrs. Ch’in for a long while, and after they had\nchatted on one thing and another, she again reiterated the assurances\nthat this illness involved no danger, and distracted her for ever so\nlong.",
        "“Whether I get well or not,” observed Mrs. Ch’in, “we’ll know in spring;\nnow winter is just over, and I’m anyhow no worse, so that possibly I may\nget all right; and yet there’s no saying; but, my dear sister-in-law, do\npress our old lady to compose her mind! yesterday, her ladyship sent me\nsome potato dumplings, with minced dates in them, and though I had two,\nthey seem after all to be very easily digested!”",
        "“I’ll send you round some more to-morrow,” lady Feng suggested; “I’m now\ngoing to look up your mother-in-law, and will then hurry back to give my\nreport to our dowager lady.”",
        "“Please, sister-in-law,” Mrs. Ch’in said, “present my best respects to\nher venerable ladyship, as well as to madame Wang.”",
        "Lady Feng signified that she would comply with her wishes, and,\nforthwith leaving the apartment, she came over and sat in Mrs. Yu’s\nsuite of rooms.",
        "“How do you, who don’t see our son’s wife very often, happen to find\nher?” inquired Mrs. Yu.\r",
        "Lady Feng drooped her head for some time. “There’s no help,” she\nventured, “for this illness! but you should likewise make every\nsubsequent preparation, for it would also be well if you could scour it\naway.”",
        "“I’ve done so much as to secretly give orders,” replied Mrs. Yu, “to get\nthings ready; but for that thing (the coffin), there’s no good timber to\nbe found, so that it will have to be looked after by and by.”",
        "Lady Feng swallowed hastily a cup of tea, and after a short chat, “I\nmust be hurrying back,” she remarked, “to deliver my message to our\ndowager lady!”",
        "“You should,” urged Mrs. Yu, “be sparse in what you tell her lady ship\nso as not to frighten an old person like her!”",
        "“I know well enough what to say,” replied lady Feng.",
        "Without any further delay, lady Feng then sped back. On her arrival at\nhome she looked up the old lady. “Brother Jung’s wife,” she explained,\n“presents her compliments, and pays obeisance to your venerable\nladyship; she says that she’s much better, and entreats you, her worthy\nsenior, to set your mind at ease! That as soon as she’s a little better\nshe will come and prostrate herself before your ladyship.”",
        "“How do you find her?” inquired dowager lady Chia.",
        "“For the present there’s nothing to fear,” continued lady Feng; “for her\nmien is still good.”",
        "After the old lady had heard these words, she was plunged for a long\nwhile in deep reflection; and as she turned towards lady Feng, “Go and\ndivest yourself of your toilette,” she said, “and have some rest.”",
        "Lady Feng in consequence signified her obedience, and walked away,\nreturning home after paying madame Wang a visit. P’ing Erh helped lady\nFeng to put on the house costume, which she had warmed by the fire, and\nlady Feng eventually took a seat and asked “whether there was anything\ndoing at home?”",
        "P’ing Erh then brought the tea, and after going over to hand the cup:\n“There’s nothing doing,” she replied; “as regards the interest on the\nthree hundred taels, Wang Erh’s wife has brought it in, and I’ve put it\naway. Besides this, Mr. Jui sent round to inquire if your ladyship was\nat home or not, as he meant to come and pay his respects and to have a\nchat.”",
        "“Heng!” exclaimed lady Feng at these words. “Why should this beast\ncompass his own death? we’ll see when he comes what is to be done.”",
        "“Why is this Mr. Jui so bent upon coming?’ P’ing Erh having inquired,\nlady Feng readily gave her an account of how she had met him in the\ncourse of the ninth moon in the Ning mansion, and of what had been said\nby him.",
        "“What a mangy frog to be bent upon eating the flesh of a heavenly\ngoose!” ejaculated P’ing Erh. “A stupid and disorderly fellow with no\nconception of relationship, to harbour such a thought! but we’ll make\nhim find an unnatural death!”",
        "“Wait till he comes,” added lady Feng, “when I feel certain I shall find\nsome way.”",
        "What happened, however, when Chia Jui came has not, as yet, been\nascertained, but listen, reader, to the explanation given in the next\nchapter.",
