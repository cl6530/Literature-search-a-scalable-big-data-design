        "Whoever looks at a map of the Gargano promontory will see that it is\nbesprinkled with Greek names of persons and places–Matthew, Mark,\nNikander, Onofrius, Pirgiano (Pyrgos) and so forth. Small wonder, for\nthese eastern regions were in touch with Constantinople from early days,\nand the spirit of Byzance still hovers over them. It was on this\nmountain that the archangel Michael, during his first flight to Western\nEurope, deigned to appear to a Greek bishop of Sipontum, Laurentius by\nname; and ever since that time a certain cavern, sanctified by the\npresence of this winged messenger of God, has been the goal of millions\nof pilgrims.",
        "The fastness of Sant’ Angelo, metropolis of European angel-worship, has\ngrown up around this “devout and honourable cave\"; on sunny days its\nhouses are clearly visible from Man-fredonia. They who wish to pay their\ndevotions at the shrine cannot do better than take with them\nGregorovius, as cicerone and mystagogue.",
        "Vainly I waited for a fine day to ascend the heights. At last I\ndetermined to have done with the trip, be the weather what it might. A\ncoachman was summoned and negotiations entered upon for starting next\nmorning.",
        "Sixty-five francs, he began by telling me, was the price paid by an\nEnglishman last year for a day’s visit to the sacred mountain. It may\nwell be true–foreigners will do anything, in Italy. Or perhaps it was\nonly said to “encourage” me. But I am rather hard to encourage,\nnowadays. I reminded the man that there was a diligence service there\nand back for a franc and a half, and even that price seemed rather\nextortionate. I had seen so many holy grottos in my life! And who, after\nall, was this Saint Michael? The Eternal Father, perchance? Nothing of\nthe kind: just an ordinary angel! We had dozens of them, in England.\nFortunately, I added, I had already received an offer to join one of the\nprivate parties who drive up, fourteen or fifteen persons behind\none diminutive pony–and that, as he well knew, would be a matter of\nonly a few pence. And even then, the threatening sky . . . Yes, on\nsecond thoughts, it was perhaps wisest to postpone the excursion\naltogether. Another day, if God wills! Would he accept this cigar as a\nrecompense for his trouble in coming?",
        "In dizzy leaps and bounds his claims fell to eight francs. It was the\ntobacco that worked the wonder; a gentleman who will give something for\nnothing (such was his logic)–well, you never know what you may not get\nout of him. Agree to his price, and chance it!",
        "He consigned the cigar to his waistcoat pocket to smoke after dinner,\nand departed–vanquished, but inwardly beaming with bright anticipation.",
        "A wretched morning was disclosed as I drew open the shutters–gusts of\nrain and sleet beating against the window-panes. No matter: the carriage\nstood below, and after that customary and hateful apology for breakfast\nwhich suffices to turn the thoughts of the sanest man towards themes of\nsuicide and murder–when will southerners learn to eat a proper\nbreakfast at proper hours?–we started on our journey. The sun came out\nin visions of tantalizing briefness, only to be swallowed up again in\ndriving murk, and of the route we traversed I noticed only the old stony\ntrack that cuts across the twenty-one windings of the new carriage-road\nhere and there. I tried to picture to myself the Norman princes, the\nemperors, popes, and other ten thousand pilgrims of celebrity crawling\nup these rocky slopes–barefoot–on such a day as this. It must have\ntried the patience even of Saint Francis of Assisi, who pilgrimaged with\nthe rest of them and, according to Pontanus, performed a little miracle\nhere en passant, as was his wont.",
        "After about three hours’ driving we reached the town of Sant’ Angelo. It\nwas bitterly cold at this elevation of 800 metres. Acting on the advice\nof the coachman, I at once descended into the sanctuary; it would be\nwarm down there, he thought. The great festival of 8 May was over, but\nflocks of worshippers were still arriving, and picturesquely pagan they\nlooked in grimy, tattered garments–their staves tipped with\npine-branches and a scrip.",
        "In the massive bronze doors of the chapel, that were made at\nConstantinople in 1076 for a rich citizen of Amalfi, metal rings are\ninserted; these, like a true pilgrim, you must clash furiously, to call\nthe attention of the Powers within to your visit; and on issuing, you\nmust once more knock as hard as you can, in order that the consummation\nof your act of worship may be duly reported: judging by the noise made,\nthe deity must be very hard of hearing. Strangely deaf they are,\nsometimes.",
        "The twenty-four panels of these doors are naively encrusted with\nrepresentations, in enamel, of angel-apparitions of many kinds; some of\nthem are inscribed, and the following is worthy of note:",
        "“I beg and implore the priests of Saint Michael to cleanse these gates\nonce a year as I have now shown them, in order that they may be always\nbright and shining.” The recommendation has plainly not been carried out\nfor a good many years past.",
        "Having entered the portal, you climb down a long stairway amid swarms of\npious, foul clustering beggars to a vast cavern, the archangel’s abode.\nIt is a natural recess in the rock, illuminated by candles. Here divine\nservice is proceeding to the accompaniment of cheerful operatic airs\nfrom an asthmatic organ; the water drops ceaselessly from the rocky\nvault on to the devout heads of kneeling worshippers that cover the\nfloor, lighted candle in hand, rocking themselves ecstatically and\ndroning and chanting. A weird scene, in truth. And the coachman was\nquite right in his surmise as to the difference in temperature. It is\nhot down here, damply hot, as in an orchid-house. But the aroma cannot\nbe described as a floral emanation: it is the bouquet, rather, of\nthirteen centuries of unwashed and perspiring pilgrims. “TERRIBILIS EST\nLOCUS ISTE,” says an inscription over the entrance of the shrine. Very\ntrue. In places like this one understands the uses, and possibly the\norigin, of incense.",
        "I lingered none the less, and my thoughts went back to the East, whence\nthese mysterious practices are derived. But an Oriental crowd of\nworshippers does not move me like these European masses of fanaticism; I\ncan never bring myself to regard without a certain amount of disquietude\nsuch passionate pilgrims. Give them their new Messiah, and all our\npainfully accumulated art and knowledge, all that reconciles civilized\nman to earthly existence, is blown to the winds. Society can deal with\nits criminals. Not they, but fond enthusiasts such as these, are the\nmenace to its stability. Bitter reflections; but then–the drive upward\nhad chilled my human sympathies, and besides–that so-called breakfast.\n. . .",
        "The grovelling herd was left behind. I ascended the stairs and,\nprofiting by a gleam of sunshine, climbed up to where, above the town,\nthere stands a proud aerial ruin known as the “Castle of\nthe Giant.” On one of its stones is inscribed the date 1491–a certain\nQueen of Naples, they say, was murdered within those now crumbling\nwalls. These sovereigns were murdered in so many castles that one\nwonders how they ever found time to be alive at all. The structure is a\nwreck and its gateway closed up; nor did I feel any great inclination,\nin that icy blast of wind, to investigate the roofless interior.",
        "I was able to observe, however, that this “feudal absurdity” bears a\nnumber like any inhabited house of Sant’ Angelo–it is No. 3.",
        "This is the latest pastime of the Italian Government: to re-number\ndwellings throughout the kingdom; and not only human habitations, but\nwalls, old ruins, stables, churches, as well as an occasional door-post\nand window. They are having no end of fun over the game, which promises\nto keep them amused for any length of time–in fact, until the next\ncraze is invented. Meanwhile, so long as the fit lasts, half a million\nbright-eyed officials, burning with youthful ardour, are employed in\naffixing these numerals, briskly entering them into ten times as many\nnote-books and registering them into thousands of municipal archives,\nall over the country, for some inscrutable but hugely important\nadministrative purposes. “We have the employes,” as a Roman deputy once\ntold me, “and therefore: they must find some occupation.”",
        "Altogether, the weather this day sadly impaired my appetite for research\nand exploration. On the way to the castle I had occasion to admire the\nfine tower and to regret that there seemed to exist no coign of vantage\nfrom which it could fairly be viewed; I was struck, also, by the number\nof small figures of Saint Michael of an ultra-youthful, almost\ninfantile, type; and lastly, by certain clean-shaven old men of the\nplace. These venerable and decorative brigands–for such they would have\nbeen, a few years ago–now stood peacefully at their thresholds, wearing\na most becoming cloak of thick brown wool, shaped like a burnous. The\ngarment interested me; it may be a legacy from the Arabs who dominated\nthis region for some little time, despoiling the holy sanctuary and\nleaving their memory to be perpetuated by the neighbouring “Monte\nSaraceno.” The costume, on the other hand, may have come over from\nGreece; it is figured on Tanagra statuettes and worn by modern Greek\nshepherds. By Sardinians, too. ... It may well be a primordial form of\nclothing with mankind.",
        "The view from this castle must be superb on clear days. Standing there,\nI looked inland and remembered all the places I had intended to\nsee–Vieste, and Lesina with its lakes, and Selva Umbra, whose very name\nis suggestive of dewy glades; how remote they were, under such\ndispiriting clouds! I shall never see them. Spring hesitates to smile\nupon these chill uplands; we are still in the grip of winter–",
        "so sang old Horace, of Garganian winds. I scanned the horizon, seeking\nfor his Mount Vulture, but all that region was enshrouded in a grey\ncurtain of vapour; only the Stagno Salso–a salt mere wherein Candelaro\nforgets his mephitic waters–shone with a steady glow, like a sheet of\npolished lead.",
        "Soon the rain fell once more and drove me to seek refuge among the\nhouses, where I glimpsed the familiar figure of my coachman, sitting\ndisconsolately under a porch. He looked up and remarked (for want of\nsomething better to say) that he had been searching for me all over the\ntown, fearing that some mischief might have happened to me. I was\ntouched by these words; touched, that is, by his child-like simplicity\nin imagining that he could bring me to believe a statement of such\nradiant improbability; so touched, that I pressed a franc into his\nreluctant palm and bade him buy with it something to eat. A whole franc.\n. . . Aha! he doubtless thought, my theory of the gentleman: it\nbegins to work.",
        "It was barely midday. Yet I was already surfeited with the angelic\nmetropolis, and my thoughts began to turn in the direction of\nManfredonia once more. At a corner of the street, however, certain\nfluent vociferations in English and Italian, which nothing would induce\nme to set down here, assailed my ears, coming up–apparently–out of the\nbowels of the earth. I stopped to listen, shocked to hear ribald\nlanguage in a holy town like this; then, impelled by curiosity,\ndescended a long flight of steps and found myself in a subterranean\nwine-cellar. There was drinking and card-playing going on here among a\nparty of emigrants–merry souls; a good half of them spoke English and,\ndespite certain irreverent phrases, they quickly won my heart with a\n“Here! You drink this, mister.”",
        "This dim recess was an instructive pendant to the archangel’s cavern. A\nnew type of pilgrim has been evolved; pilgrims who think no more of\ncrossing to Pittsburg than of a drive to Manfredonia. But their cave was\npermeated with an odour of spilt wine and tobacco-smoke instead of the\nsubtle Essence des pelerins aes Abruzzes fleuris, and alas, the\nobject of their worship was not the Chaldean angel, but another and\nequally ancient eastern shape: Mammon. They talked much of dollars; and\nI also heard several unorthodox allusions to the “angel-business,” which\nwas described as “played out,” as well as a remark to the effect that\n“only damn-fools stay in this country.” In short, these men were at the\nother end of the human scale; they were the strong, the energetic; the\nruthless, perhaps; but certainly–the intelligent.",
        "And all the while the cup circled round with genial iteration, and it\nwas universally agreed that, whatever the other drawbacks of Sant’\nAngelo might be, there was nothing to be said against its native liquor.",
        "It was, indeed, a divine product; a vino di montagna of noble\npedigree. So I thought, as I laboriously scrambled up the stairs once\nmore, solaced by this incident of the competition-grotto and slightly\ngiddy, from the tobacco-smoke. And here, leaning against the door-post,\nstood the coachman who had divined my whereabouts by some dark masonic\nintuition of sympathy. His face expanded into an inept smile, and I\nquickly saw that instead of fortifying his constitution with sound food,\nhe had tried alcoholic methods of defence against the inclement weather.\nJust a glass of wine, he explained. “But,” he added, “the horse is\nperfectly sober.”",
        "That quadruped was equal to the emergency. Gloriously indifferent to our\nfates, we glided down, in a vertiginous but masterly vol-plane, from the\nsomewhat objectionable mountain-town.",
        "An approving burst of sunshine greeted our arrival on the plain.",
