        "“How’d you sleep, Sam?”",
        "“Didn’t sleep a durn bit.”",
        "“Neither did I. I was shivering all night. I got up an’ put the spare\nblanket on, but it didn’t do any good.”",
        "“Wonder if there was a chills-and-fever fog or something?”",
        "“How’d you find it, Sappy?”",
        "“All right.”",
        "“Didn’t smell any fog?”",
        "“Nope.”",
        "The next night it was even worse. Guy slept placidly, if noisily, but\nSam and Yan tumbled about and shivered for hours. In the morning at\ndawn Sam sat up.",
        "“Well, I tell you this is no joke. Fun’s fun, but if I am going to\nhave the shivers every night I’m going home while I’m able.”",
        "Yan said nothing. He was very glum. He felt much as Sam did, but was\nless ready to give up the outing.",
        "Their blues were nearly dispelled when the warm sun came up, but still\nthey dreaded the coming night.",
        "“Wonder what it is,” said Little Beaver.",
        "“’Pears to me powerful like chills and fever and then again it don’t.\nMaybe we drink too much swamp water. I believe we’re p’isoned with\nGuy’s cooking.”",
        "“More like getting scurvy from too much meat. Let’s ask Caleb.”",
        "Caleb came around that afternoon or they would have gone after him.\nHe heard Yan’s story in silence, then, “Have ye sunned your blankets\nsense ye came?”",
        "“No.”",
        "Caleb went into the teepee, felt the blankets, then grunted: “H-m!\nJest so. They’re nigh soppin’. You turn in night after night an’ sweat\nan’ sweat in them blankets an’ wonder why they’re damp. Hain’t you\nseen your ma air the blankets every day at home? Every Injun squaw\nknows that much, an’ every other day at least she gives the blankets a\nsun roast for three hours in the middle of the day, or, failing that,\ndries them at the fire. Dry out your blankets and you won’t have no\nmore chills.”",
        "The boys set about it at once, and that night they experienced again\nthe sweet, warm sleep of healthy youth.",
        "There was another lesson they had to learn in campercraft. The\nMosquitoes were always more or less of a plague. At night they forced\nthe boys into the teepee, but they soon learned to smudge the insects\nwith a wad of green grass on the hot fire. This they would throw on\nat sundown, then go outside, closing the teepee tight and eat supper\naround the cooking fire. After that was over they would cautiously\nopen the teepee to find the grass all gone and the fire low, a dense\ncloud of smoke still in the upper part, but below it clear air.\nThey would then brush off the Mosquitoes that had alighted on their\nclothes, crawl into the lodge and close the door tight. Not a Mosquito\nwas left alive in it, and the smoke hanging about the smoke-vent was\nenough to keep them from coming in, and so they slept in peace. Thus\nthey could baffle the worst pest of the woods. But there was yet\nanother destroyer of comfort by day, and this was the Blue-bottle\nflies. There seemed more of them as time went on, and they laid masses\nof yellowish eggs on anything that smelled like meat or corruption.\nThey buzzed about the table and got into the dishes; their dead,\ndrowned and mangled bodies were polluting all the food, till Caleb\nremarked during one of his ever-increasing visits: “It’s your own\nfault. Look at all the filth ye leave scattered about.”",
        "There was no blinking the fact; for fifty feet around the teepee the\nground was strewn with scraps of paper, tins and food. To one side\nwas a mass of potato peelings, bones, fish-scales and filth, and\neverywhere were the buzzing flies, to be plagues all day, till at\nsundown the Mosquitoes relieved them and took the night shift of the\noffice of torment.",
        "“I want to learn, especially if it’s Injun,” said Little Beaver. “What\nhad we best do?”",
        "“Wall, first ye could move camp; second, ye could clean this.”",
        "As there was no other available camp ground they had no choice, and\nYan said with energy: “Boys, we got to clean this and keep it clean,\ntoo. We’ll dig a hole for everything that won’t burn.”",
        "So Yan seized the spade and began to dig in the bushes not far from\nthe teepee. Sam and Guy were gradually drawn in. They began gathering\nall the rubbish and threw it into the hole. As they tumbled in bones,\ntins and scraps of bread Yan said: “I just hate to see that bread go\nin. It doesn’t seem right when there’s so many living things would be\nglad to get it.”",
        "At this, Caleb, who was sitting on a log placidly smoking, said:",
        "“Now, if ye want to be real Injun, ye gather all the eatables ye don’t\nwant–meat, bread and anything, an’ every day put it on some\nhigh place. Most generally the Injuns has a rock–they call it\nWakan; that means sacred medicine–an’ there they leave scraps\nof food to please the good spirits. Av coorse it’s the birds and\nSquirrels gets it all; but the Injun is content as long as it’s gone,\nan’ if ye argy with them that ’tain’t the spirits gets it, but the\nbirds, they say: ’That doesn’t matter. The birds couldn’t get it if\nthe spirits didn’t want them to have it,’ or maybe the birds took it\nto carry to the spirits!”",
        "Then the Grand Council went out in a body to seek the Wakan\nRock. They found a good one in the open part of the woods, and it\nbecame a daily duty of one to carry the remnants of food to the rock.\nThey were probably less acceptable to the wood creatures than they\nwould have been half a year later, but they soon found that there were\nmany birds glad to eat at the Wakan; and moreover, that before\nlong there was a trail from the brook, only twenty-five yards away,\nthat told of four-foots also enjoying the bounty of the good spirits.",
        "Within three days of this the plague of Bluebottles was over, and the\nboys realized that, judging by its effects, the keeping of a dirty\ncamp is a crime.",
        "One other thing old Caleb insisted on: “Yan,” said he, “you didn’t\nought to drink that creek water now; it ain’t hardly runnin’. The sun\nhez it het up, an’ it’s gettin’ too crawly to be healthy.”",
        "“Well, what are we going to do?” said Sam, though he might as well\nhave addressed the brook itself.",
        "“What can we do, Mr. Clark?”",
        "“Dig a well!”",
        "“Phew! We’re out here for fun!” was Sam’s reply.",
        "“Dig an Injun well,” Caleb said. “Half an hour will do it. Here, I’ll\nshow you.”",
        "He took the spade and, seeking a dry spot, about twenty feet from the\nupper end of the pond he dug a hole some two feet square. By the time\nhe was down three feet the water was oozing in fast. He got it down\nabout four feet and then had to stop, on account of inflow. He took a\nbucket and bailed the muddy stuff out right to the bottom, and let it\nfill up to be again bailed out. After three bailings the water came in\ncold, sweet, and pure as crystal.",
        "“There,” said he, “that water is from your pond, but it is filtered\nthrough twenty feet of earth and sand. That’s the way to get cool,\npure water out of the dirtiest of swamps. That’s an Injun well.”",
