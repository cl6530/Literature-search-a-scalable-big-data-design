        "THE RUINED RIVER-PORT AND THE TATTERED FLAG.",
        "On the night of January 10 we steamed out of Las Palmas to cover the\nlong line of 940 miles between Grand Canary and Bathurst. The\nA. S. S. generously abandons the monopoly of the Gambia to its rival,\nthe B. and A., receiving in exchange the poor profits of the Isles de\nLos. Consequently the old Company’s ships, when homeward-bound, run\ndirectly from Sierra Leone to Grand Canary, a week’s work of 1,430\nknots.",
        "Hardly had we lost sight of the brown and barren island and Las Palmas\nin her magpie suit, than we ran out of the Brisa Parda, or grey\nnorth-east Trade, into calm and cool Harmatan [Footnote: The word is of\ndisputed origin. Ahalabata, or ahalalata, on the Gold Coast\nis a foreign term denoting the dry norther or north-easter that blows\nfrom January to March or April (Zimmerman). Christalier makes\nharamata, ’Spanish harmatan, an Arabic word.’] weather. We\nbegrudged the voyage this lovely season, which should have been kept for\nthe journey. After the damp warmth of Madeira the still and windless air\nfelt dry, but not too dry; cold, but not too cold; decidedly fresh in\nearly morning, and never warm except at 3 P.M. The sun was pale and\nshorn, as in England, seldom showing a fiery face before 10 A.M. or\nafter 5 P.M. The sea at night appeared slightly milky, like the white\nwaters so often seen off the western coast of India. Every traveller\ndescribes the Harmatan, and most travellers transcribe the errors\ntouching the infusoria and their coats which Ehrenberg found at sea in\nthe impalpable powder near the Cape Verde islands. The dry cold blast is\npurely local, not cosmical. There is a fine reddish-yellow sand in the\nlower air-strata; we see it, we feel it, and we know that it comes from\nthe desert-tracts of northern Africa. The air rises en masse from\nthe Great Sahara; the vacuum is speedily filled by the heavier and\ncooler indraught from the north or south, and the higher strata form the\nupper current flowing from the Equator to the Poles. But ’siliceous\ndust’ will not wholly account for the veiling of the sun and the\nopaqueness of the higher atmosphere. This arises simply from the want of\nhumidity; the air is denser, and there is no vapour to refract and\nreflect the light-rays. Hence the haze which even in England appears to\noverhang the landscape when there is unusually droughty weather; and\nhence, conversely, as all know, the view is clearest before and after\nheavy showers, when the atmosphere is saturated or supersaturated.",
        "On my return in early April we caught the northeast Trades shortly after\nturning Cape Palmas, and kept them till close upon Grand Canary. They\nwere a complete contrast with the Harmatan, the firmament looking\nexceptionally high, and the sun shining hot, while a crisp, steady gale\nmade the ’herds of Proteus’ gambol and disport themselves over the long\nridges thrown up by the cool plain of bright cerulean. The horizon, when\nclear, had a pinkish hue, and near coast and islands puffy folds of\ndazzling white, nearly 5,000 feet high, were based upon dark-grey\nstreaks of cloudland simulating continents and archipelagoes. Within the\ntropics the heavens appear lower, and we never sight blue or purple\nwater save after a tornado. The normal colour is a dirty, brassy\nyellow-brown, here and there transparent, but ever unsightly in the\nextreme. It must depend upon some unexplained atmospheric conditions;\nand the water-aspect is often at its ugliest when the skies are\nclearest. I have often seen the same tints when approaching Liverpool.",
        "Through the Harmatan-haze we failed to sight Cape Juby, opposite\nFuerteventura; and at Santa Cruz I missed Mr. Mackenzie, the energetic\nflooder of the Sahará. He has, they say, given up this impossibility and\nopened a comptoir: its presence is very unpleasant to the French\nmonopolists, who seem to ’monopole’ more every year. South of Juby comes\nhistoric Cape Bojador, the ’Gorbellied,’ and Cabo Blanco, which is to\nnorthern what Cabo Negro is to southern Africa. The sole remarkable\nevents in its life are, firstly, its being named by Ptolemy Granaria\nExtrema, whence the Canarii peoples south-west of the Moroccan Atlas and\nour corrupted ’Canaries;’ and, secondly, its rediscovery by one Gonçalez\nBaldeza in 1440.",
        "On the afternoon of Saturday (January 14) we sighted in the offing the\ntwo paps of Ovedec, or Cabo Verde, the Hesperou Keras, the Hesperium or\nArsenarium Promontorium of Pliny, the trouvaille of Diniz\nFernandez in 1446. The name is sub judice. Some would derive it\nfrom the grassy green slope clad with baobabs (Adansonia\ndigitata), megatherium-like monsters, topping the precipitous\nsea-wall which falls upon patches of yellow sand. Others would borrow it\nfrom the Sargasso (baccifera), Golfão, or Gulf-weed, which here\nbecomes a notable feature. Cape Verde, the Prasum Promontorium of West\nAfrica, is the ’Trafalgar,’ the westernmost projection, of the Dark\nContinent ’fiery yet gloomy;’ measuring 17° 3’ from the meridian of\nGreenwich. The coast is exceedingly dangerous; consequently shipwrecks\nare rare. The owners, as their national wont is, have done their best to\nmake it safe. Two lighthouses to the north of the true Cape mark and\ndefine a long shoal with a heavy break, the Almadies rocks, a ledge\nmostly sunk, but here and there rising above the foam in wicked-looking\ndiabolitos (devilings), or black fangs, of which the largest is\ndie-shaped. A third pharos, also brilliantly whitewashed, crowns the\nCape, and by its side is a lower sea-facing building, the sanatorium;\nfinally, there is a light at the mole-end of Dakar.",
        "Steaming past the Madeleine rocks, here and there capped with green and\nwhitened by sea-fowl, we sight, through an opening in the curtain of\ncoast, the red citadel and the subject town of Goree, the Gibraltar of\nwestern Africa, and the harbour of St. Louis, capital of Senegambia. The\nisland is now the only port, the headquarters having suffered from the\nsand-bar at the mouth of the Senegal. Here our quondam rivals have made\nthe splendid harbour of Dakar, whose jetties accommodate 180,000 tons of\nshipping at the same time. This powerful and warlike colony, distant\nonly twelve hours’ steaming from Bathurst, has her fleet of steamers for\nriver navigation; her Tirailleurs du Sénégal, and her large force of\nfighting native troops. Fortified stations defend the course of the\nriver, even above the falls, from the hostile and treacherous Moors. The\nsubject and protected territories exceed Algeria in extent, and the\nposition will link the French possessions in the Mediterranean with the\nrich mineral lands proposed for conquest in the south.",
        "We English hug to ourselves the idea that the French are bad colonists:\nif so, France, like China and India, is improving at a pace which\npromises trouble. Algeria, Senegambia, and Siam should considerably\nmodify the old judgment. Our neighbours have, and honestly own to, two\ngrand faults–an excessive bureaucracy and a military, or rather a\nmartinet, discipline, which interferes with civil life and which governs\ntoo much. On the other side England rules too little. She is at present\nbetween the two proverbial stools. She has lost the norm of honour,\nAristocracy; and she has lost it for ever. But she has not yet acquired\nthe full strength of democracy. This is part secret of that\ndisorganisation which is causing such wonder upon the continent of\nEurope. Moreover, Colonial England has caught the disease of\nnon-interference and the infection of economy, the spawn of Liberalism;\nwhile her savings, made by starving her establishments, are of the\ncategory popularly described as penny-wise and pound-foolish. France has\nadopted the contrary policy. She spends her money freely in making ports\nand roads and in opening communication through adjacent countries. She\nlately sent a cruiser to Madeira, proposing to connect Dakar by\ntelegraph with the Cape Verde islands. She is assiduous in forming\nfriendly, or rather peaceable, relations with the people. She begins on\nthe right principle by officering her colonies with her best men, naval\nand military. In England anyone is good enough for West Africa. She\nimpresses the natives, before beginning to treat, by an overwhelming\ndisplay of force; and, if necessary, by hard knocks. She educates the\nchildren of the chiefs, and compels all her lieges, under a penalty, to\nlearn, and if possible to speak, French. So far from practising\nnon-interference, she allows no one to fight but herself. This\nimperious, warlike, imperial attitude is what Africa wants. It reverses\nour Quaker-like ’fad’ for peace. We allow native wars to rage ad\nlibitum even at Porto Loko, almost within cannon-shot of Sierra\nLeone. On the Gambia River the natives have sneeringly declared that\nthey will submit to the French, who are men, but not to us, who are\n------. Later still, the chiefs of Futa-Jalon went, not to London, but\nto Paris.",
        "In 1854 France commenced a new and systematic course of colonial\npolicy. She first beat the Pulos (Fulahs), once so bold, and then she\norganised and gave flags to them. She checked, with a strong hand, the\nattacks of the Moors upon the gum-gatherers of the Sahará. And now,\nafter drawing away from us the Gambia trade, she has begun a railway\nintended to connect the Senegal with the Niger and completely to\noutflank us. This line will annex the native regions behind our\nsettlements, and make Bathurst and Sierra Leone insignificant\ndependencies upon the continent of Gallic rule. The total distance is at\nleast 820 miles, and the whole will be guarded by a line of forts. It\nbegins with a section of 260 kilometres, which will transport valuable\ngoods now injured by ass and camel-carriage. The natives, wearied with\nincessant petty wars, are ready to welcome the new comers. The western\nSúdán, or Niger-basin, has a population estimated at forty millions,\nready, if a market be opened, to flock to it with agricultural and\nindustrial products, including iron, copper, and gold. Meanwhile the\nJoliba (Black Water), with the Benuwe and other tributaries, offers a\nready-made waterway for thousands of miles. Sierra Leone lies only 400\nmiles, less than half, from the Niger; but what would the Colonial\nOffice say if a similar military line were proposed? Nor can we console\nourselves by the feeble excuse that Senegal has a climate superior to\nthat of our ’pest-houses.’ On the contrary, she suffers severely from\nyellow fever, which has never yet visited the British Gold Coast. Her\nmortality is excessive, but she simply replaces her slain. She has none\nof that mawkish, hysterical humanitarianism which of late years has\nbecome a salient feature in our campaigning. During the Ashanti affair\nthe main object seems to have been, not the destruction of the enemy,\nbut to save as many privates as possible from ague and fever, sunstroke\nand dysentery.",
        "Ninety miles beyond Cape Verde placed us in the Gambia waters, off the\nlands of the Guinea region. I will not again attempt a history of the\ndisputed word which Barbot derives from Ginahoa, the first negro region\nvisited by the Portuguese; others from Ghana, the modern Kano; from the\nJenneh or Jinne of Mungo Park; from Jenna, a coast-town once of note,\ngoverned by an officer under the ’King’ of Gambia-land, and, in fine,\nfrom the Italian Genoa.",
        "The s.s. Senegal spent the night of the 14th on the soft and\nslippery mud, awaiting the dawn. What can the Hydrographic Department of\nthe Admiralty be doing? What is the use of the three cruisers that still\nrepresent the old ’Coffin Squadron’? This coast has not had a survey\nsince 1830, yet it changes more or less every year, and half a century\nmakes every map and plan obsolete. But perhaps it would be wrong to risk\nseamen’s lives by exposure in open boats to ’insolation,’ showers, and\nsurf.",
        "From sunrise the sea had changed its Harmatan-grey for a dull, muddy,\ndirty green; and the leadsman, who is now too civilised to ’sing out’ in\nthe good old style, calmly announced that the channel was\nshallowing. ’Gambia,’ or ’Gambi,’ the Gamboa and Gambic of Barbot\n(Chapter VII.), is said to mean clear water, here a perfect misnomer; it\nis miry as the Mersey. The ’molten gold of the Gambia River’ is only the\nfine phrase of some poetic traveller. Low land loomed on both sides,\nwith rooty and tufted mangroves, apparently based upon the waves,\nshowing that we approached an estuary, which soon narrowed from thirty\nmiles to seven and to two. Three buoys, the outermost red, then the\n’fairway’ with chequers and cage, and lastly white without cage, all at\na considerable distance off the land, marked the river-bar, and\npresently a black pilot came on board from his cutter. We made some\neasting running along shore, and gave a wide berth to the Horseshoe Bank\nand St. Mary’s shoal portwards, to African Knoll and Middle Ground\nstarboardwards, and to a crowd of other pleasant patches, where the\nwater was dancing a breakdown in the liveliest way.",
        "As we drew in shore the now burning sun shone with a sickly African heat\nthrough the scirocco-clouds and the thick yellow swamp-reek. ’It will be\nworse when we land,’ said the normal Job’s comforter. Six knots to\nstarboard, (west), on high and healthy Cape St. Mary, rose a whitewashed\nbuilding from a dwarf red cliff. To port on the river’s proper right\nbank (east) lay Fort Bullen, an outpost upon a land-tongue, dead-green\nas paint, embosomed in tall bentangs, or bombax-trees (Pullom\nCeiba). This ’silk-cotton-tree’ differs greatly in shape from its\ncongener in Eastern Africa. The bole bears sharp, broad-based thorns;\nthe wings or flying buttresses are larger; several trunks rarely\nanastomose; the branches seldom stand out horizontally, nor are the\nleaves disposed in distinct festoons. It is, however, a noble growth,\nuseful for shade and supplying a soft wood for canoes and stuffing for\npillows. Fort Bullen, about one hour’s row from Bathurst, formerly\nlodged a garrison of seventeen men under the ’Commandant and Governor of\nthe Queen’s Possessions in the Barra Country.’ Now the unwholesome site\nhas been abandoned.",
        "The island and station of St. Mary, Bathurst, of old a graveyard, now\nstart up to starboard. The site was chosen apparently for its superior\ndevelopment of mud and mangrove, miasma and malaria. It is an island\nwithin an island. St. Mary the Greater is the northernmost of that mass\nof riverine holms and continental islands which, formed by the Cachéo\nand other great drains, extends south to the Rio Grande. Measuring some\ntwenty miles from north to south, by six from east to west, it is\nembraced by the two arms of the Gambia delta, and is marked in old maps\nas the Combo, Forni, and Felúp country. St. Mary the Less, upon which\nstands the settlement facing east, is bounded eastward by the main mouth\nand westward by Oyster Creek, a lagoon-like branch: it is a mere\nsand-patch of twenty-one square miles, clothed by potent heats and\nflooding rains with a vivid and violent vegetation. Water is found\neverywhere three feet below the surface, but it is bad and\nbrackish. There is hardly any versant or shed; in places the land sinks\nbelow the water-level; and, despite the excellent brick sewers, the\nshowers prefer to sop and sod the soil. And, lest the island should be\nbodily carried away by man, there is a penalty for removing even a\npailful of sand from the beach.",
        "Bathurst was unknown in the days of Mungo Park, when traders ran up\nstream to Jilifri, nearly opposite Fort James, and to Pisania, the end\nof river-navigation. St. Mary’s Island, together with British Combo,\nAlbreda, and the land called the ’Ceded,’ or ’English Mile,’ were bought\nfrom the Mandenga chief of the Combo province. First christened\nSt. Leopold, and then Bathurst, after the minister of that name, the\nactual town owes its existence to an order issued by Sir Charles\nMacarthy. That ill-starred Governor of Sierra Leone (1814-24) is still\nremembered in Ashanti and on the Gold Coast: he is immortalised by a\npestiferous island in the Upper Gambia well described by Winwood\nReade. The settlement, designed for the use of liberated Africans, was\nbuilt in 1816 by Lieutenant-Colonel Brereton and by Captain Alexander\nGrant. In 1821 it was made, like the Gold Coast, a dependency of Sierra\nLeone, whose jurisdiction, after the African Company was abolished in\n1820,",
        "[Footnote: The first African Company was established by Queen Elizabeth,\nand in 1688 was allowed to trade with Guinea. The Royal African Company,\nor Guinea Company of Royal Adventurers of England trading to Africa, was\nincorporated under Charles II. on January 20, 1663. A third was patented\non September 27, 1672. The ’African Company’ (1722-24) was not allowed\nto interfere with ’interlopers.’  On May 7,1820, it was abolished, after\nbankruptcy, and its possessions passed over to the Crown.]",
        "extended from N. lat. 20° to S. lat. 20°. I found it an independent\ngovernment, one of four, in 1860 to 1865. In 1866 it again passed under\nthe rule of Sierra Leone; in 1874 this ill-advised measure was\nwithdrawn, and the Gambia was placed under an Administrator and a\nLegislative Council, the former subject to the Governor-in-Chief of\nSierra Leone. A score of years ago it was garrisoned by some 300 men of\nthe West African Corps. Now it is reduced to 100 armed policemen: the\nGambia militia, composed of the Combo and Macarthy’s Island forces, is\nnever called out. The population of the twenty-one square miles is given\nby Whittaker for 1881 as 14,150, including 105 whites. The Wesleyans\nhere, as everywhere, preponderating on the Coast, number 1,405 souls;\nthe Catholics 500, and the Episcopalians 200.",
        "Another half-hour placed before us Bathurst in full view. The first\nsalient point is the graveyard, where the station began and where the\nstationed end. Wags declare that the first question is, ’Have you seen\nour burial-ground?’ A few tomb-stones, mostly without inscriptions, are\nscattered so near the shore that corpses and coffins have been washed\naway by the waves. If New Orleans be a normal ’wet grave,’ this\neverywhere save near the sea is dry with a witness, the depth and\nlooseness of the sand making the excavation a crumbling hole. Four\ngovernors, a list greatly to be prolonged, ’lie here interred.’ But\nmatters of climate are becoming too serious for over-attention to such\nplaces or subjects.",
        "The first aspect of this pest-house from afar is not unpleasant. A long\nline of scattered houses leads to the mass of the settlement, faced by\nits Marine Parade, and the tall trees give it a home-look; some have\ncompared the site with ’parts of the park at Cheltenham.’  At a nearer\nview the town of some 5,000 head suggests the idea of a small European\nwatering-place. The execrable position has none of those undulations\nwhich make heaps of men’s homes picturesque; everything is low, flat,\nand straight-lined as a yard of pump-water. The houses might be those of\nByculla, Bombay; in fact, they date from the same epoch. They are\nexcellent of their kind, large uncompact piles of masonry,\nglistening-white or dull-yellow, with blistered paint, and slates,\ntiles, or shingles, which last curl up in the sun like feathers. A\nnearer glance shows the house-walls stained and gangrened with rot and\nmildew, the river-floods often shaking hands with the rains in the\nground-floors. The European ends in beehive native huts, rising from the\nswamp and sand; and these gradually fine off and end up-stream, becoming\nsmall by degrees and hideously less.",
        "Bathurst has one compensating feature, the uncommon merit of an\nesplanade; the noble line of silk-cotton trees separating houses from\nriver is apparently the only flourishing item. We remark that while some\nof these giants are clad in their old leaves others are bright green\nwith new foliage, while others are bare and broomy as English woods in\nmidwinter. They are backed by a truly portentous vegetation of red and\nwhite mangroves, palms, plantains, and baobabs, rank guinea-grass\nfilling up every gap with stalks and blades ten feet tall.",
        "Nor was the scene in the river-harbour at all more lively. The old\nAlbert, of Nigerian fame, has returned to mother Earth; but we\nstill note H.M.S. Dover, a venerable caricature, with funnel long\nand thin, which steams up stream when not impotent–her chronic\ncondition. There are two large Frenchmen loading ground-nuts, but ne’er\nan Englishman. The foreshore is defaced by seven miserable wharves,\nshaky mangrove-piles, black with age and white with oystershells, driven\ninto the sand and loosely planked over. There is an eighth, the\ngunpowder pier, on the north face of the island; and we know by its\ndilapidation that it is Government property. These stages are intended\nnot for landing–oh, no!–but only for loading ships; stairs are\nwanting, and passengers must be carried ashore ’pick-a-back.’ The\nlabourers are mainly, if not wholly, ’Golah’ women of British Combo,\nwhose mates live upon the proceeds of their labours. To-day being\nSunday, the juvenile piscators of Bathurst muster strong upon the piers,\nand no policeman bids them move on.",
        "When the mail-bags were ready, we received a visit from the black\nhealth-officer, and we reflected severely on the exceeding ’cheek’ of\ninspecting, as a rule, new comers from old England at this yellow Home\nof Pestilence. But in the healthy time of the year we rarely see the\nlistless, emaciated whites with skins stained by unoxygenised carbon, of\nwhom travellers tell. Despite the sun, all the Bathurstians save the\nGovernment officials–now few, too few–flocked on board. Mail-days are\nhere, as in other places down-coast, high days and holidays. But times\nare changed, and the ruined river-port can no longer afford the old\ntraditional hospitality.",
        "Cameron and I landed under Brown’s Wharf, the southernmost pier opposite\nthe red roof and the congeries of buildings belonging to the late\nproprietor. We then walked up the High Street, or esplanade, which is\nopen to the river except where the shore is cumbered with boats, hides,\nlumber, and beach-negroes. This is a kind of open-air market where men\nand women sit in the shade, spinning, weaving, and selling fruits and\nvegetables with one incessant flux of tongue. Here, too, amongst the\nheaps, and intimately mixed with the naked infantry, stray small goats,\npretty and deer-shaped, and gaunt pigs, sharp-snouted and long-legged as\nthe worst Irisher.",
        "Several thoroughfares, upper and lower, run parallel with the river; all\nare connected, like a chess-board, by cross-lanes at right angles, and\ntheir grass-grown centres are lined by open drains of masonry, now\nbone-dry. The pavement is composed of stone and dust, which during the\nrains becomes mud; the trottoirs are in some places of brick, in\nothers of asphalte, in others of cracked slabs. Mostly, however, we walk\non sand and gravel, which fills our boots with something harder than\nunboiled peas. The multiplicity of useless walls, the tree-clumps, and\nthe green sward faintly suggested memories of a semi-deserted\nsingle-company station in Western India; and the decayed, tumble-down\nlook of all around was a deadly-lively illustration of the Hebrew\nIchabod.",
        "I passed, with a sense of profound sadness, the old Commissariat\nquarters, now degraded to a custom-house. The roomy, substantial edifice\nof stone and lime, with large, open verandahs, here called piazzas,\nlofty apartments, galleries, terraced roofs, and, in fact, everything an\nAfrican house should have, still stood there; but all shut up, as if the\nantique domus were in mourning for the past. What Homeric feeds,\nwhat noctes coenoeque deorum, we have had there in joyous past\ntimes! But now that most hospitable of West-Coasters, Commissary Blanc,\nhas been laid in the sandy cemetery; and where, oh! where are the rest\nof the jovial crew, Martin and Sherwood? I found only one relic of the\nbygone–and a well-favoured relic he is–Mr. W. N. Corrie, with whom to\nexchange condolences and to wail over the ruins.",
        "Passing the post-office and the French, Spanish, Portuguese, and\nAmerican consulates, poor copies of the dear old Commissariat, we halted\noutside at Mr. Goddard’s, and obtained from Mr. R. E. Cole a copy of his\nlecture, ’The River Gambia,’ read at York, September 1881. It gave me\npleasure to find in it, ’The man that is wanted throughout the West\nCoast of Africa is not the negro, but the Chinaman; and should he ever\nturn his steps in its direction he will find an extensive and\nremunerating field for the exercise of his industry and intelligence.’",
        "We then turned our attention from the town to the townspeople. They have\nnot improved in demeanour during the last twenty years. Even then the\n’liberateds’ and ’recaptives,’ chiefly Akus and Ibos, had begun the\n’high jinks,’ which we shall find at their highest in Sierra Leone. They\nhad organised ’Companies,’ the worst of trade-unions, elected headmen,\nindulged in strikes, and more than once had come into serious collision\nwith the military. The Mandengas, whom Mungo Park calls Mandingoes and\ncharacterises as a ’wild, sociable, and obliging people,’ soon waxed\nturbulent and unruly. This is to be expected; a race of warriors must be\ngoverned by the sword. They would prefer for themselves military law to\nall the blessings of a constitution or a plébiscite. But philanthropy\nwills otherwise, and in these days the English authorities do not keep\nup that state whose show secures the respect of barbarians. Where the\nGovernor walks about escortless, like a private individual, he must\nexpect to be ’treated as such.’",
        "There is no difficulty in distinguishing at first sight Moslem from\nKafir. Besides the gypsy-like Pulo, the ’brown race,’ our older Fúlahs\nand Fellalahs, whose tongue is said to be a congener of the Nubian; and\nthe wild, half-naked pagan Jolu, the principal tribes, are two, the\nMandengas and the Wólofs. The former, whom Europeans divide into the\nMarabút, who does not drink, and the Soninki, who does, inhabit a\ntriangle, its base being the line from the south of the Senegal to the\nGambia River, and its apex the Niger; it has even extended to near\nTin-Bukhtu (the Well of Bukhtu), our Timbuctoo. In old Mohammedan works\ntheir territory is called Wángara. This race of warmen and horsemen\nsurprisingly resembles the Somal, who hold the same parallels of\nlatitude in Eastern Africa, as to small heads, semi-Caucasian features,\nAsiatic above the nose-tip and African below; tall lithe figures, high\nshoulders, and long limbs, especially the forearm.",
        "There is the usual Negro-land variety in the picturesque toilette; no\ntwo men are habited alike. A Phrygian bonnet, Glengarry or Liberty-cap\nof dark, indigo-dyed cotton, and sometimes a Kan-top or ear-calotte of\nIndia and Hausa-land, surmount their clean-shaven heads. For this they\nsubstitute, when travelling, ’country umbrellas,’ thatches of plaited\npalm-leaves in umbrella-shape; further down coast we shall find the\nregular sun-hat of Madeira, with an addition of loose straw-ends which\nwould commend itself to Ophelia. The decent body-garb is a kamís,\na nightgown of long-cloth, and wide, short drawers; the whole is covered\nwith a sleeveless abá, or burnous, and sometimes with a\nhalf-sleeved caftan–here termed ’tobe’–garnished with a huge\nbreast-pocket. It is generally indigo-stained, with marblings or\nbroad-narrow stripes of lighter tint than the groundwork. An essential\narticle, hung round the neck or slung to the body, is the grigri,\nta’awíz, or talisman, a Koranic verse or a magic diagram enclosed\nin a leathern roll or in a flat square. Of these prophylactics, which\nanswer to European medals and similar fetish, a ’serious person’ will\nwear dozens; and they are held to be such ’strong medicine’ that even\npagans will barter or pay for them. Blacksmiths, weavers, and spinners\nwork out of doors. Contrary to the general Moslem rule, these Mandengas\nhonour workers in iron and leather, and the king’s blacksmith and\ncobbler are royal councillors.",
        "Some of the motley crowd sit reading what the incurious stranger tells\nyou is ’the Alcoran;’ they are perusing extracts and prayers written in\nthe square, semi-Cufic Maghrabi character, which would take a learned\nMeccan a week to decipher. Others, polluted by a license which calls\nitself liberty, squat gambling shamelessly with pegs stuck in the\nground. Now and then fighting-looking fellows ride past us, with the\nArabic ring-bit and the heavy Mandenga demi-pique. The nags are ponies\nsome ten hands high, ragged and angular, but hardy and sure-footed. As\nmost of the equines in this part of Africa, they are, when well fed,\nintensely vicious and quarrelsome. Like the Syrians, they have only\nthree paces, the walk, the lazy loping canter, and the brisk hard\ngallop; the trot is a provisional passage from slow to fast. Yet with\nall their shortcomings I should prefer them to the stunted bastard barb,\nlocally called an Arab and priced between 20l. and 40l.\nThe latter generally dies early from chills and checked\nperspiration, which bring on ’loin-disease,’ paralysis of the\nhind-quarters, or from a fatal swelling of the stomach, the result of\nbad forage. Most of the men carried knives, daggers, and crooked swords\nin curious leather scabbards. This practice should never be permitted in\nAfrica. Natives entering a station should be compelled to leave their\nweapons with the policeman at the nearest guard-house.",
        "The Wólofs, a name formerly written Joloff, also dwell in Senegambia,\nbetween the Senegal and the Gambia, and their habitat is divided into\nsundry petty kingdoms. As early as 1446 they were known to the\nPortuguese, and one Bemoy, of princely house, soon afterwards visited\nLisbon, was baptised, and did homage to D. João II. More like the\nAbyssinians than their Mandenga neighbours, they are remarkable for good\nlooks, pendent ringlets, and tasteful dress and decorations. ’Black but\ncomely,’ with long, oval faces, finely formed features, straight noses\nand glossy jetty skins, in character they are brave and dignified, and\nthey are distinctly negroids, not negroes. This small maritime tribe,\nwho make excellent sailors, is interesting and civilisable; many have\nbeen Christianised, especially by the Roman Catholic missioners. The\nonly native tongue spoken by European residents at Bathurst is the\nWólof. As M. Dard remarks in his ’Grammaire Wolof,’ the [Footnote: He\nwas Instituteur de l’École Wolof-Française du Sénégal, and published in\n1826. It is still said that no one will speak Wolof like him, the result\nof the new régíme of compulsory French instruction. I printed 226\nof his proverbs in Wit and Wisdom from West Africa (London,\nTinsleys, 1865). It is curious to compare them with those of the pagan\nnegroes further south.]",
        "language is widely spread: Mungo Park often uses expressions which he\ndeems Mandenga, but which belong to the ’Jews of West Africa,’ as the\nWólofs are sometimes called, their extensive commercial dealings between\nthe coast and the western Sudan being the only point of likeness. For\ninstance, in the tale of ’poor Nealee’ the cry ’Kang-tegi!’ (’Cut her\nthroat!’) is the Wólof ’Kung-akateke!’ (’Let her head be cut off!’), and\n’Nealee affeeleeata!’ (’Nealee is lost!’)  appears equally corrupted by\nauthor or printer from ’Nealu afeyleata!’ (’Nealee breathes no more!’)",
        "Pursuing our peregrinations, we reach No. 1 Fort, at the northern angle\nof the town, north-eastern corner of the islet St. Mary the Less. This\nold round battery is surmounted by three 32-pounders, en\nbarbette, with iron carriages and traversing platforms, but without\nracers: a single 7-inch shell would smash the whole affair. Thence we\nbent westward and passed the once neat ’Albert Market’ with its metal\nroof, built in 1854-56 by Governor Luke O’Connor and Isaac Bage. We did\nnot enter; the place swarms with both sexes in blue: African indigo\nyields a charming purple, but one soon learns to prefer white\nclothing. Nor need I describe the stuff exposed for sale: there will be\na greater variety at Sierra Leone.",
        "Passing the market we come upon the engineer’s yard, which a hand-bill\nsternly forbids us to enter. It contains a chapel, where the\nRev. Mr. Nicol officiates: this loose box is more hideous than anything\nI have yet seen, a perfect study of architectural deformity. The\ncracked bell and the nasal chant, at times rising to a howl as of\nanguish, were completely in character. As the service ended issued a\nstream of worshippers, mostly women, attired in costumes which will be\nnoticed further on; most of them led negrolings suggesting the dancing\ndog. Meanwhile the police, armed only with side-arms, sword-bayonets,\nand looking more like Sierra Leone convicts reformed and uniformed,\nfollowed a band composed of drums, cymbals, and a haughty black\nsergeant, a mulatto noncommissioned, bringing up the rear. They went\nround and round the barrack square, a vast space occupied chiefly by\ngrass and drains; in the back-ground is the large jaundiced building\nupon whose clock-tower floated, or rather depended, the flag of\nSt. George. The white building by its side is the Colonial Hospital: it\nhas also seen ’better days.’",
        "We resolved to call upon Mr. Administrator V. S. Goulsbury, M.D. and\nC.M.G. He had lately been subjected to an attack, of course anonymous,\nin the ’African Times;’ an attack the more ungentlemanly and cowardly\nbecause it reflected upon his private not public life; and consequently\nhe could neither notice it nor answer it, nor bring an action for\nlibel. This scandalous print, which has revived the old ’Satirist’ in\nits most infamous phase, habitually inserts any tissue of falsehoods\nsuggested to proceed from a ’native,’ an ’African,’ a ’negro,’ and\ncarefully writes down to the lowest level of its readers. It attracts\nattention by the cant of charity, and shows its devotion to ’the Bible,\nand nothing but the Bible,’ by proving that the earth, having ’four\ncorners,’ is flat, and that the sun, which once ’stood still,’ must move\nround its parasite. The manner of this pestilence is right worthy of its\nmatter, and the style would be scouted in a decent housekeeper’s\nroom. All well-meaning men, of either colony, declare that it has done\nmore harm in West Africa than the grossest abuse yet written. Its tactic\nis to set black against white, to pander for the public love of scandal,\nand systematically to abuse all the employés of Government. And the sole\nobject of this vile politic, loudly proclaimed to be philanthropic and\nnegrophile, has been low lucre–in fact, an attempt to butter its bread\nwith ’black brother.’",
        "We inspected the second or western fort, a similar battery of six\n32-pounders, with two 10-inch mortars, fit only to pound ’fúfú,’ or\nbanana-paste; add a single brass field-piece, useful as a morning and\nevening gun for this highly military station. Then we came to Government\nHouse, apparently deserted, flying a frayed and tattered white and blue\nflag, which might have been used on board H.M.S. Dover, but which\nought to have been supplanted on shore by a Union Jack. After waiting a\nquarter of an hour, we managed, with the assistance of a sentinel, whose\nfeet were in slippers and whose artillery carbine was top-heavy with a\nfixed sword-bayonet, to arouse a negro servant, by whom we sent in our\ncards to H.E. the Administrator. An old traveller on the Gold Coast, and\nlately returned from a long expedition into the interior, [Footnote:\nGambia: Expedition to the Upper Gambia. London: Eyre and\nSpottiswoode, 1882.] he had much to tell us. His knowledge of\nAshanti-land, however, induced him to place the Kong Mountains in that\nmeridian too far north; he held the distance from the seaboard to be at\nleast 500 miles. But he quite agreed with us about the necessity of\nimporting Chinese coolies. Here no free man works. The people say, ’When\na slave gets his liberty he will drink rainwater’–rather than draw it\nfrom a well. The chief cargo of the S.S. Senegal was Chinese\nrice, when almost every acre of the lower Gambia would produce a cereal\nsuperior in flavour and bolder in grain. Hands, however, are wanting;\nand all the women are employed in loading and unloading ships.",
        "The Residency is a fine large building in an advanced stage of\ndecomposition; the glorious vegetation around it–cotton-trees,\ncaoutchouc-figs, and magnificent oleanders–making the pile look grimmer\nand grislier. And here we realised, to the fullest extent, how\nthoroughly ruined is the hapless settlement. The annual income is about\n24,500l., the expenditure is 20,000l. in round numbers,\nand the economies are said to reach 25,000l. This sum is\nforwarded to the colonial chest, instead of being expended in local\nimprovements; and, practically, when some petty war-storm breaks it is\nwasted like water. The local officials are not to be blamed for this\nmiserable system, this niggardly colonial policy of the modern\neconomical school, which contrasts so poorly with the lavish republican\nexpenditure in French Senegambia. They have, to their honour be it said,\noften protested against the taxes raised from struggling merchants and a\nstarveling population, poor as Hindûs, being expended upon an ’imperial\npolicy.’ But economy is the order of the day at home, and an\nAdministrator inclined to parsimony gladly seizes the opportunity of\npleasing his ’office.’ The result is truly melancholy. I complained in\n1862 that the ’civil establishment’ at Bathurst cost 7,075l. I\nnow complain that it has been reduced to 2,600l. [Footnote:\nAdministrator = 1,300l;.; Chief Magistrate = 600l.;\nCollector and Treasurer = 700l. Thus there is no Colonial\nSecretary, and, curious to say, no Colonial Chaplain. I formerly\nrecommended the establishment to be reduced by at least one-half, and\nthat half to be far better paid (Wanderings in West Africa,\ni. 182).] The whole establishment is starved; decay appears in every\noffice, public and private; and ruin is writ large upon the whole\nstation. An Englishman who loves his country must blush when he walks\nthrough Bathurst. Even John Bull would be justified in wishing that he\nhad been born a Frenchman in West Africa.",
        "We returned to the s.s. Senegal anything but edified; and there\nanother displeasure awaited us. Our gallant captain must have known that\nhe could not load and depart that day. Yet, diplomatically mysterious,\nhe would not say so. Consequently we missed a visit to Cape St. Mary,\nthe breezy cliff of which I retain the most agreeable memory. The\nscenery had appeared to me positively beautiful after the foul swamps of\nSt. Mary’s Island;–stubbles of Guinea-corn, loved by quails; a velvety\nexpanse of green grass sloping inland, with here and there a goodly\npalmyra grander than the columns of Ba’albek; palms necklaced with\nwine-calabashes, and a grove of baobab and other forest trees cabled\nwith the most picturesque llianas, where birds of gorgeous plume sit and\nsing. We could easily have hired hammocks or horses, or, these failing,\nhave walked the distance, six or seven miles. True, Oyster Creek, the\nshallow western outlet of the Gambia, has still a ferry: a bridge was\nlately built, but it fell before it was finished. It would, however,\nhave been pleasurable to pass a night away from the fever-haunts of\nBathurst.",
        "During one of my many visits to Bathurst I resolved to inspect old Fort\nJames: one thirsts for a bit of antiquity in these African lands, so\nbare of all but modern ruins. Like Bance Island, further south, it is\nthe parent of the modern settlement; and so far it has the ’charm of\norigin.’ My companion was Captain Philippi, then well known at Lagos:\nthe last time we met was unexpectedly at Solingen. A boat with four\nKrumen was easily found; but our friends warned us that the\nascensus would be easy and the descensus the reverse; the\nlatter has sometimes taken a day and a night.",
        "The Gambia River here opens its mouth directly to the north; and, after\na great elbow, assumes its normal east-west course. We ran before a\nnine-knot breeze, and shortly before noon, after two hours’ southing, we\nwere off the half-way house, reef-girt Dog Island, and Dog Point, in the\nBarra country. The dull green stream sparkled in the sun, and the fringe\nof mangroves appeared deciduous: some trees were bare, as if dead;\nothers were clothed with bright foliage. Presently we passed British\nAlbreda, where our territory now ends. This small place has made a fuss\nin its day. It was founded by the French in 1700 as a dependency of\nGoree, and it carried on a slave-trade highly detrimental to English\ninterests. In 1783 the owners had abandoned all right to its occupation,\nand in 1858 they ceded it to their English rivals. The landing is bad,\nespecially when the miry ebb-tide is out. The old village of the French\ncompany was reduced when we visited it to a few huts and two whitewashed\nand red-roofed houses, occupied by a Frenchwoman in native dress and by\nan English subject, Mr. Hughes. The latter did the honours of the place\nand showed us the only ’punkah’ at that time known to the West African\ncoast.",
        "From Dog Island we bent to the east and passed the Jilifri or Grilofre\nvillage, in the Badibu country, a place well known during the days of\nPark. Then bending south-east, after a total of four hours, covering\nseventeen to eighteen knots, we landed upon James Island, the site of\nFort James. The scrap of ground has a history. First the Portuguese here\nbuilt a factory: Captain Jobson found this fact to his cost when (1621)\nhe sailed up in search of gold to Satico, then the last point of\nnavigation. A few words in the native dialects–’alcalde,’ for\ninstance–preserve the memory of the earliest owners. It passed\nalternately into the hands of the Dutch, French, and English, who\nexchanged some shrewd blows upon the matter of possession. In 1695 it\nwas destroyed by M. de Gennes, and was rebuilt by the Royal African\nCompany, which had monopolised the traffic. It fell again in 1702 to\nCapitaine de la Roque, and cost the conqueror his life. In 1709 it was\nattacked for the third time by M. Parent, commanding four privateering\nfrigates. About 1730 we have from Mr. Superintendent Francis Moore a\nnotice of it amongst the Company’s establishments on the Gambia\nRiver. The island is described as being situated in mid-stream, here\nthree to four miles broad, thirty miles from the mouth: the extent was\n200 yards long by fifty broad. The factory had a governor and a\ndeputy-governor, two officers, eight factors, thirteen writers, two\ninferior attendants, and thirty-two negro servants. The force consisted\nof a company of soldiers, besides armed sloops and shallops. Compare the\nsame with our starved establishment at the Ruined River-port! In other\nparts of the Gambia valley eight subordinate comptoirs, including\nJilifri or Gilofre, traded for hides and bees’-wax, ivory, slaves, and\ngold. When Mungo Park travelled (1795-97) the opening of the European\ntrade had reduced its exports to a gross value of 20,000l., in\nthree ships voyaging annually. After the African Company was abolished\n(1820) it passed over to the Crown, and the station was transferred to\nits graveyard, Sainte-Marie de Bathurst. Barbot [Footnote:\nLib. i. chap. vii., A Description of the Coasts of North and South\nGuinea, &c., in 1700. Printed in Churchill’s Collection. Also his\nSupplement, ibid. pp. 426-26.] tells us that Fort James was\nfounded (1664), under the names of the Duke of York and the Royal\nAfrican Company, by Commodore Holmes when expeditioning against the\nHollanders in North and South Guinea. It was the head-centre of trade\nand its principal defence. But, he says, the occupants were obliged to\nfetch fresh water from either bank. Had the cistern and the\npowder-magazine been bomb-proof, and drink as well as meat stored\nquant. suff., the fort would have been ’in a manner impregnable,\nif well defended by a suitable garrison.’ The latter in his day\nconsisted of sixty to seventy whites, besides ’Gromettoes,’ free black\nsepoys.",
        "This quasi-venerable site is a little holm a hundred yards in diameter,\nsomewhat larger than the many which line the river’s western bank. We\nfound its stony shingle glazed with a light-green sediment, which\nforbade bathing and which suggested fever. The material is conglomerate,\nfine and coarse, in an iron-reddened matrix; hence old writers call it a\n’sort of gravelly rock, a little above water.’ Salsolaceæ tapestry the\nshore, and fig-trees and young calabashes spring from the stone: the\nground is strewn with white shells, tiles, bricks and iridescent\nbottles–the invariable concomitants and memorials of civilisation. The\nmasonry, lime and ashlar, is excellent, but time and the portentous\ngrowth of the tropics have cracked and fissured the walls. Masses of\nmasonry are fallen, and others are assuming the needle-shape. The great\nquadrangle had lozenge-shaped bastions at each end, then lined with good\nbrick-work: the outliers, which run round the river-holm, were three\nhorseshoe redoubts ’with batteries along the palisades from one to\nanother.’ Four old iron guns remained out of a total of sixty to seventy\npieces. The features were those of the ancient slave-barracoon\n–dwelling-houses, tanks and cisterns, magazines, stores,\nand powder-room, all broken by the treasure-hunter.",
        "The return to Bathurst was a bitter draught. We had wind and water\nagainst us, and the thick mist prevented our taking bearings. Hungry,\nthirsty, weary, cross, and cramped, we reached the steamer at 5 A.M.,\nand slept spitefully as long as we could.",
        "The last displeasure of my latest visit to Bathurst was the crowd of\nnative passengers, daddy, mammy, and piccaninny, embarking for Sierra\nLeone, and the host of friends that came to bid them good-bye. They did\nnot fail to abscond with M. Colonna’s pet terrier and with the steward’s\npotatoes: no surveillance can keep this long-fingered lot from picking\nand stealing. It is a political as well as a social mistake to take\nnegro first-class passengers. A ruling race cannot be too particular in\nsuch matters, and the white man’s position on the Coast would be\nimproved were the black man kept in his proper place. A kind of\nfirst-class second-class might be invented for them. Nothing less\npleasant than their society. The stewards have neglected to serve soup\nto some negro, who at every meal has edged himself higher up the table,\nand whose conversation consists of whispering into the ear of a black\nneighbour, with an occasional guffaw like that of the ’laughing\njackass.’",
        "’I say, daddee, I want my soop. All de passenger he drink ’im\nsoop; me no drink my soop. What he mean dis palaver?’",
        "The sentence ends in a scream; the steward smiles, and the\nfirst-class resumes–",
        "’Ah, you larf. And what for you larf? I no larf, I no drinkee soop!’",
        "Here the dialogue ends, and men confess by their looks that travelling\nsometimes does throw us into the strangest society.",
        "Even in Sierra Leone, where the negro claims to be civilised, a dusky\nbelle, after dropping her napkin at a Government House dinner, has been\nheard to say to her neighbour, ’Please, Mr. Officer-man, pick up my\ntowel.’ The other day a dark dame who missed her parasol thus addressed\nH.E.: ’Grovernah! me come ere wid my umbrellah. Where he be,\nmy umbrellah Give me my umbrelláh: no go widout my\numbrelláh.’",
        "For our black and brown passengers, fore and aft, there is a graduated\nand descending scale of terminology: 1. European, that is, brought up in\nEngland; 2. Civilised man; 3. African; 4. Man of colour, the ’cullered\npussun’ of the United States; 5. Negro; 6. Darkey; and 7. Nigger, which\nhere means slave. All are altogether out of their assiettes. At\nhome they will eat perforce cankey, fufu, kiki, and bad fish, washing\nthem down with mimbo, bamboo-wine, and pitto, hopless beer,\nthe pombe of the East Coast. Here they abuse the best of roast\nmeat, openly sigh for ’palaver-sauce’ and ’palm-oil chop,’ and find\nfault with the claret and champagne. Chez eux they wear\nbreech-cloths and nature’s stockings–eoco tutto. Here both men\nand women must dress like Europeans, and a portentous spectacle it\nis. The horror reaches its height at Sierra Leone, where the pulpit as\nwell as the press should deprecate human beings making such caricatures\nof themselves,",
        "In West Africa we see three styles of dress. The first, or semi-nude, is\nthat of the Kru-races, a scanty pagne, or waist-wrapper, the dark\nskin appearing perfectly decent. The second is the ample flowing robe,\nat once becoming and picturesque, with the shalwar, or wide\ndrawers, of the Moslems from Morocco to the Equator. The third is the\nhideous Frank attire affected by Sierra Leone converts and ’white\nblackmen,’ as their fellow-darkies call them.",
        "Many of the costumes that made the decks of the s.s. Senegal\nhideous are de fantaisie, as if the wearers had stripped pegs in\nEast London with the view of appearing at a fancy-ball. The general\neffect was that of ’perambulating rainbows en petit surmounted by\nsable thunder-clouds.’ One youth, whose complexion unmistakably wore the\nshadowed livery of the burnished sun, crowned his wool with a scarlet\nsmoking-cap, round which he had wound a white gauze veil. The light of\nday was not intense, but his skin was doubtless of most delicate\ntexture. Another paraded the deck in a flowing cotton-velvet\ndressing-gown with huge sleeves, and in bottines of sky-blue\ncloth. Even an Aku Moslem, who read his Koran, printed in Leipzig, and\nwho should have known better, had mimicked Europeans in this most\nunbecoming fashion.",
        "Men of substance sported superfine Saxony with the broadest of\nsilk-velvet collars; but the fit suggested second-hand finery. Other\nelongated cocoa-nuts bore jauntily a black felt of ’pork-pie’ order,\nleek-green billycocks, and anything gaudy, but not neat, in the\n’tile’-line. Their bright azure ribbons and rainbow neckties and scarves\nvied in splendour with the loudest of thunder-and-lightning waistcoats\nfrom the land of Moses and Sons. Pants were worn tight, to show the\ngrand thickness of knee, the delicate leanness of calf, the manly\npurchase of heel, and the waving line of beauty which here distinguishes\nshin-bones. There were monstrous studs upon a glorious expanse of\n’biled’ shirt; a small investment of cheap, tawdry rings set off the\nchimpanzee-like fingers; and, often enough, gloves invested the hands,\nwhose horny, reticulated skin reminded me of the black fowl, or the\nscaly feet of African cranes pacing at ease over the burning sands. Each\ndandy had his badine upon whose nice conduct he prided himself;\nthe toothpick was as omnipresent as the crutch, nor was the\n’quizzing-glass’ quite absent. Lower extremities, of the same category\nas the hands, but slightly superior in point of proportional size, were\ncrammed into patent-leather boots, the latter looking as if they had\nbeen stuffed with some inanimate substance–say the halves of a calf’s\nhead. Why cannot these men adopt some modification of the Chinese\ncostume, felt hat and white shoes, drawers, and upper raiment\nhalf-shirt, half-doublet? It has more common sense than any other in the\nworld.",
        "It is hardly fair to deride a man’s ugliness, but the ugly is fair game\nwhen self-obtruded into notice by personal vanity and conceit. Moreover,\nthis form of negro folly is not to be destroyed by gentle raillery; it\nwants hard words, even as certain tumours require the knife. Such aping\nof Europeans extends from the physical to the moral man, and in general\nonly the bad habits, gambling, drinking, and debauching, are aped.",
        "The worst and not the least hideous were the mulattos, of whom the\nnegroes say they are silver and copper, not gold. It is strange, passing\nstrange, that English blood, both in Africa and in India, mixes so badly\nfor body and mind (brain) with the native. It is not so with the\nneo-Latin nations of Southern Europe and the Portuguese of the\nBrazil. For instance, compare the pretty little coloured girls of\nPondicherry and Mahé with their sister half-castes the Chichis of Bengal\nand Bombay.",
        "As for the section conventionally called ’fair,’ and unpolitely termed\nby Cato the ’chattering, finery-loving, ungovernable sex,’ I despair to\ndepict it. When returning north in the A.S.S. Winnebah, we\ncarried on board a dark novice of the Lyons sisterhood. She looked\nperfectly ladylike in her long black dress and the white wimple which\nbound her hair under the sable mantilla. But the feminines on board the\nSenegal bound for Sierra Leone outrage all our sense of fitness\nby their frightful semi-European gowns of striped cottons and chintzes;\nby their harlequin shawls and scarves thrown over jackets which show\nmore than neck and bare arms to the light of day, and by the head-gear\nwhich looks like devils seen in dreams after a heavy supper of underdone\npork. Africa lurks in the basis: the harsh and wiry hair is gathered\ninto lumps, which to the new comer suggest only bears’ ears, and into\nchignons resembling curled up hedge-hogs. Around it is twisted a\nkerchief of arsenic-green, of sanguineous-crimson, or of sulphur-yellow;\nand this would be unobjectionable if it covered the whole head, like\nthe turban of the Mina negress in Brazilian Bahia. But it must be capped\nwith a hat or bonnet of straw, velvet, satin, or other stuff, shabby in\nthe extreme, and profusely adorned with old and tattered ribbons and\nfeathers, with beads and bugles, with flowers and fruits. The tout\nensemble would scare any crow, however bold.",
        "I am aware that the sex generally is somewhat persistent in its ideas of\npersonal decoration, and that there is truth in the African proverb, ’If\nyour head is not torn off you will wear a head-dress,’ corresponding\nwith our common saying, ’Better out of the world than out of the\nfashion.’ But this nuisance, I repeat, should be abated with a strong\nhand by the preacher as well as by the pressman. The women and the\nchildren are well enough as Nature made them: they make themselves mere\ncaricatures, figures o’ fun, guys, frights. If this fact were brought\nhome to them by those whose opinions they value, they might learn a\nlittle common sense and good taste. And yet–wait a moment–may they not\nsometimes say the same of us? But our monstrosities are original, theirs\nare borrowed.",
        "The ’mammies’ at once grouped themselves upon the main-hatch, as near\nthe quarter-deck and officers’ cabins as possible. I can hardly\nunderstand how Englishmen take a pleasure in ’chaffing’ these grotesque\nbeings, who usually reply with some gross, outrageous insolence. At the\nbest they utter impertinences which, issuing from a big and barbarous\nmouth in a peculiar patois, pass for pleasantry amongst those who\nare not over-nice about the quality of that article. The tone of voice\nis peculiar; it is pitched in the usual savage key, modified by the\ntwang of the chapel and by the cantilene of the Yankee–originally\nPuritan Lancashire. Hence a ’new chum’ may hear the women talking for\nseveral days before he finds out that they are talking English. And they\nspeak two different dialects. The first, used with strangers, is\n’blackman’s English,’intelligible enough despite the liberties it takes\nwith pronunciation, grammar, and syntax. The second is a kind of ’pidgin\nEnglish,’ spoken amongst themselves, like Bolognese or Venetians when\nthey have some reason for not talking Italian. One of the Gospels was\nprinted in it; I need hardly say with what effect. The first verse runs,\n’Lo vo famili va Jesus Christus, pikien. (piccaninny) va David, dissi da\npikien va Abraham.’ [Footnote: Da Njoe Testament, &c. Translated\ninto the negro-English language by the missionaries of the Unitas\nFratrum, &c. Printed by the British and Foreign Bible Society. London:\nW. McDowall, Pemberton Row, 1829.]",
        "This ’pidgin English’ runs down West Africa, except the Gold Coast and\nabout Accra, where the natives have learnt something better. The\nprincipal affirmation is ’Enh,’ pronounced nanny-goat fashion, and they\nalways answer ’Yes’ to a negative question: e.g. Q. ’Didn’t you\ngo then?’ A. ’Yes’ (sub-audi, I did not), thus meaning ’No.’\n’Na,’ apparently an interrogative in origin, is used pleonastically on\nall occasions: ’You na go na steamer?’ ’Enty’ means indeed; ’too much,’\nvery; ’one time,’ once; and the sign of the vocative, as in the Southern\nStates of the Union, follows the, word:’ Daddy, oh!’ ’Mammy, oh!’\n’Puss,’ or ’tittle,’ is a girl, perhaps a pretty girl; ’babboh,’ a\nboy. ’Hear’ is to obey or understand; ’look,’ to see; ’catch,’ to have;\n’lib,’ to live, to be, to be found, or to enjoy good health: it is\napplied equally to inanimates. ’Done lib’ means die; ’sabby’\n(Portuguese) is to know; ’chop,’ to eat; ’cut the cry,’ to end a wake;\n’jam head,’ or ’go for jam head,’ to take counsel; ’palaver (Port.)\nset,’ to end a dispute; to ’cut yamgah’ is to withhold payment, and to\n’make nyanga’ is to junket. ’Yam’ is food; ’tummach’ (Port.) is the\nmetaphorical heart; ’cockerapeak’ is early dawn, when the cock speaks;\nall writing, as well as printing, is a ’book;’ a quarrel is a ’bob;’ and\nall presents are a ’dash,’ ’dassy’ in Barbot, and ’dashs’ in Ogilby. All\nbulls are cows, and when you would specify sex you say ’man-cow’ or\n’woman-cow.’  [Footnote: For amusing specimens of amatory epistles the\nreader will consult Mrs. Melville and the Ten Years’ Wanderings among\nthe Ethiopians (p. 19), by my old colleague, Mr. Consul Hutchinson.]",
        "These peculiarities, especially the grammatical, are not mere\ncorruptions: they literally translate the African dialects now utterly\nforgotten by the people. And they are more interesting than would at\nfirst appear. Pure English, as a language, is too difficult in all\npoints to spread far and wide. ’Pidgin English’ is not. Already the\nChinese have produced a regular lingua franca, and the Japanese\nhave reduced it to a system of grammar. If we want only a medium of\nconversation, a tongue can be reduced to its simplest expression and\nwithal remain intelligible. Thus ’me’ may serve for I, me, my. Verbs\nwant no modal change to be understood. ’Done go’ and ’done eat’\nperfectly express went and ate. Something of the kind is still wanted,\nand must be supplied if we would see our language become that of the\ncommercial world in the East as it is fast becoming in the West.",
        "We left Bathurst more than ever convinced that the sooner we got rid of\nthe wretched station, miscalled a colony, the better. It still supplies\nhides from the tipper country, ivory, bees’-wax, and a little gold. The\nprecious metal is found, they say, in the red clay hills near Macarthy’s\nIsland; but the quality is not pure, nor is the quantity sufficient to\npay labour. The Mandengas, locally called ’gold strangers,’ manage the\ntraffic with the interior, probably the still mysterious range called\nthe ’Kong Mountains.’ They are armed with knives, sabres, and muskets;\nand for viaticum they carry rude rings of pure gold, which, I am told,\nare considered more valuable than the dust.",
        "But the staple export from Bathurst–in fact, nine-tenths of the\ntotal–consists of the arachide, pistache, pea-nut, or ground-nut\n(Arachis hypoga). It is the beat quality known to West Africa;\nand, beginning some half a century ago, large quantities are shipped for\nMarseilles, to assist in making salad-oil. Why this ’olive-oil’ has not\nbeen largely manufactured in England I cannot say. Thus the French have\nmonopolised the traffic of the Gambia; they have five houses, and the\nthree English, Messrs. Brown, Goddard, and Topp, export their purchases\nin French bottoms to French ports.",
        "Moreover, the treaty of 1845, binding the ’high contracting Powers’ to\nrefrain from territorial aggrandisement (much like forbidding a growing\nboy to grow), expired in 1855. Since that time, whilst we have refrained\neven from abating the nuisance of native wars, our very lively\nneighbours have annexed the Casamansa River, with the fine coffee-lands\nextending from the Nunez southwards to the Ponga River, and have made a\ndoughty attempt to absorb Matacong, lying a few miles north of Sierra\nLeone.",
        "Whilst English Gambia is monopolised by the French, French Gaboon is, or\nrather was, in English hands. For a score of years men of sense have\nasked, ’Why not exchange the two?’ When nations so decidedly rivalistic\nmeet, assuredly it is better to separate à l’aimable. Moreover,\nso long as our economical and free-trade ’fads’ endure, it is highly\nadvisable to avoid the neighbourhood of France and invidious comparisons\nbetween its policy and our non-policy, or rather impolicy.",
        "According to the best authorities, the whole of the West African coast\nnorth of Sierra Leone might be ceded with advantage to the French on\ncondition of our occupying the Gaboon and the regions, coast and\nislands, south of it, except where the land belongs to the Portuguese\nand the Spaniards. Some years ago an energetic effort was made to effect\nthe exchange, but it was frustrated by missionary and sentimental\nconsiderations. Those who opposed the idea shuddered at the thought of\nmaking over to a Romanist Power (?) the poor converts of Protestantism;\nthe peoples who had been peaceful and happy so long under the protecting\naegis of Great Britain; the races whom we were bound, by an unwritten\ncontract, not only to defend, but to civilise, to advance in the paths\nof progress. The colonists feared to part with the old effete\npossession, lest the French should oppose, as they have done in Senegal,\nall foreign industry–in fact, ’seal up’ the Gambia. A highly\nrespectable merchant, the late Mr. Brown, contributed not a little, by\nhis persuasive pen, to defeat the proposed measure. And now it is to be\nfeared that we have heard the last of this matter; our rivals have found\nout the high value of their once despised equatorial colony. If ever the\nexchange comes again to be discussed, I hope that we shall secure by\ntreaty or purchase an exclusively British occupation of Grand Bassam and\nthe Assini valley, mere prolongations of our Protectorate on the Gold\nCoast. A future page will show the reason why our imperial policy\nrequires the measure. At present both stations are occupied by French\nhouses or companies, who will claim indemnification, and who can in\njustice demand it.",
        "We steamed out of the Ruined River-port, and left ’this old sandbank in\nAfrica they call St. Mary’s Isle,’ at 11 A.M. on January 16, with a last\nglance at the Commissariat-buildings. Accompanied by a mosquito-fleet of\ncanoes, each carrying two sails, we stood over the bar, sighting the\nheavy breakers which defend the island’s northern face, and passed Cape\nSt. Mary, gradually dimming in the distance. After Bald Cape, some sixty\nmiles south, we ran along the long low shore, distinguished only by the\nmouths and islands of the Casamansa and the Cachéo rivers. Our course\nthen led us by the huge and hideous archipelago off the delta of Jeba\nand the Bolola, the latter being the ’Rio Grande’ of Camoens, which\nPortuguese editors will print with small initials, and which translators\nmistranslate accordingly. [Footnote: The Lusiads, v. 12. I have\nnoticed this error in Camoens: his Life and his Lusiads\n(vol. i. p. 896. London: Quaritch, 1881). It was probably called Grande\nbecause it was generally believed to be the southern outlet of the\nNiger.] These islands are the Bijougas, or Bissagos, the older\n’Biziguiches,’ inhabited by the most ferocious negroes on the coast, who\nmassacred the Portuguese and who murder all castaways. They are said to\nshoot one another as Malays ’run amok,’ and some of their tribal customs\nare peculiar to themselves.",
        "Here, about 350 miles north of Sierra Leone, was established the\nunfortunate Bulama colony. Its first and last governor, the redoubtable\nCaptain Philip Beaver, R.N., has left the queerest description of the\nplace and its people. [Footnote: African Memoranda. Baldwin, London,\n1805.] Within eighteen months only six remained of 269 souls, including\nwomen and children. In 1792 the island was abandoned, despite its wealth\nof ground-nuts. After long ’palavering’ it was again occupied by\nMr. Budge, manager of Waterloo Station, Sierra Leone; but he was not a\nfixture there. It is now, I believe, once more deserted.",
        "Early next morning we were off the Isles de Los, properly Dos Idolos (of\nthe Idols). On my return northwards I had an opportunity of a nearer\nview. The triad of parallel rock-lumps, sixty miles north of Sierra\nLeone, is called Tama, or Footabar, to the west; Ruma, or Crawford, a\ncentral and smaller block of some elevation; and Factory Island, the\nlargest, five or six miles long by one broad, and nearest the\nshore. Their aspect is not unpleasant: the features are those of the\nSierra Leone peninsula, black rocks, reefs, and outliers, underlying\nridges of red soil; and the land is feathered to the summit with palms,\nrising from stubbly grass, here and there patched black by the\nbush-fire. A number of small villages, with thatched huts like beehives,\nare scattered along the shore. The census of 1880 gives the total\nfigures at 1,300 to 1,400, and of these 800 inhabit Factory\nIsland. Mr. J. M. Metzger, the civil and intelligent sub-collector and\ncustom-house officer, a Sierra Leone man, reduced the number to 600,\nhalf of them occupying the easternmost of the three. He had never heard\nof the golden treasures said to have been buried here by Roberts the\npirate, the Captain (Will.) Kidd of these regions.",
        "In our older and more energetic colonial days we had a garrison on the\nIsles de Los. They found the climate inferior to the Banana group, off\nCape Shilling. Factory Island still deserves its name. Here M. Verminck,\nof Marseille, the successor of King Heddle, has a factory on the eastern\nside, an establishment managed by an agent and six clerks, with large\nwhite dwellings, store-houses, surf-boats, and a hulk to receive his\npalm-oil. The latter produces the finest prize-cockroaches I have yet\nseen.",
        "My lack of strength did not allow me to inspect the volcanic craters\nsaid to exist in these strips, or to visit any of the ’devil-houses.’\nMr. G. Neville, agent of the steamers at Lagos, gave me an account of\nhis trip. Landing near the French factory, he walked across the island\nin fifteen minutes, followed the western coast-line, turned to the\nsouth-west, descended a hollow, and found the place of sacrifice. Large\nboulders, that looked as if shaken down by an earthquake, stood near one\nanother. There were neither idols nor signs of paganism, except that the\nfloor, which resembled the dripstone of Tenerife, was smoothed by the\nfeet of the old worshippers. When steaming round the south-western point\nwe saw–at least so it was said–the famous ’devil-house’ which gave the\nislands their Portuguese name.",
        "Factory is divided by a narrow strait from Tumbo Island, and the latter\nfaces the lands occupied by the Susus. These equestrian tribes,\ninhabiting a grassy plain, were originally Mandengas, who migrated south\nto the Mellikuri, Furikaria, and Sumbuyah countries, and who\nintermarried with the aboriginal Bulloms, Tonko-Limbas, and Baggas. All\nare Moslems, and their superior organisation enabled them to prevail\nagainst the pagan Timnis, who in 1858-59 applied to the Government of\nSierra Leone for help, and received it. Of late years the chances of war\nhave changed, and the heathenry are said to have gained the upper\nhand. The Susus are an industrious tribe, and they trade with our colony\nin gum, ground-nuts, and benni, or sesamum-seed.",
        "It is uncommonly pleasant to leave these hotbeds and once more to\nbreathe the cool, keen breath of the Trades, laden with the health of\nthe broad Atlantic.",
