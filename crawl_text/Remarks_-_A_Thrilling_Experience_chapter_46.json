        "I had a very thrilling experience the other evening. I had just filled an\nengagement in a strange city, and retired to my cozy room at the hotel.",
        "The thunders of applause had died away, and the opera house had been\nlocked up to await the arrival of an Uncle Tom’s Cabin Company. The last\nloiterer had returned to his home, and the lights in the palace of the\npork packer were extinguished.",
        "No sound was heard, save the low, tremulous swash of the sleet outside, or\nthe death-rattle in the throat of the bath-tub. Then all was still as the\nbosom of a fried chicken when the spirit has departed.",
        "The swallow-tail coat hung limp and weary in the wardrobe, and the gross\nreceipts of the evening were under my pillow. I needed sleep, for I was\nworn out with travel and anxiety, but the fear of being robbed kept me\nfrom repose. I know how desperate a man becomes when he yearns for\nanother’s gold. I know how cupidity drives a wicked man to mangle his\nvictim, that he may win precarious prosperity, and how he will often take\na short cut to wealth by means of murder, when, if he would enter\npolitics, he might accomplish his purpose as surely and much more safely.",
        "Anon, however, tired nature succumbed. I know I had succumbed, for the\nbell-boy afterward testified that he heard me do so.",
        "The gentle warmth of the steam-heated room, and the comforting assurance\nof duty well done and the approval of friends, at last lulled me into a\ngentle repose.",
        "Anyone who might have looked upon me, as I lay there in that innocent\nslumber, with the winsome mouth slightly ajar and the playful limbs cast\nwildly about, while a merry smile now and then flitted across the regular\nfeatures, would have said that no heart could be so hard as to harbor ill\nfor one so guileless and so simple.",
        "I do not know what it was that caused me to wake. Some slight sound or\nother, no doubt, broke my slumber, and I opened my eyes wildly. The room\nwas in semi-darkness.",
        "Hark!",
        "A slight movement in the corner, and the low, regular breathing of a human\nbeing! I was now wide awake. Possibly I could have opened my eyes wider,\nbut not without spilling them out of their sockets.",
        "Regularly came that soft, low breathing. Each time it seemed like a sigh\nof relief, but it did not relieve me. Evidently it was not done for that\npurpose. It sounded like a sigh of blessed relief, such as a woman might\nheave after she has returned from church and transferred herself from the\nembrace of her new Russia iron, black silk dress into a friendly wrapper.",
        "Regularly, like the rise and fall of a wave on the summer sea, it rose and\nfell, while my pale lambrequin of hair rose and fell fitfully with it.",
        "I know that people who read this will laugh at it, but there was nothing\nto laugh at. At first I feared that the sigh might be that of a woman who\nhad entered the room through a transom in order to see me, as I lay wrapt\nin slumber, and then carry the picture away to gladden her whole life.",
        "But no. That was hardly possible. It was cupidity that had driven some\ncruel villain to enter my apartments and to crouch in the gloom till the\nproper moment should come in which to spring upon me, throttle me, crowd a\nhotel pillow into each lung, and, while I did the Desdemona act, rob me of\nmy hard-earned wealth.",
        "Regularly still rose the soft breathing, as though the robber might be\ntrying to suppress it. I reached gently under the pillow, and securing the\nmoney I put it in the pocket of my robe de nuit. Then, with great care,\nI pulled out a copy of Smith & Wesson’s great work on “How to Ventilate\nthe Human Form.” I said to myself that I would sell my life as dearly as\npossible, so that whoever bought it would always regret the trade.",
        "Then I opened the volume at the first chapter and addressed a thirty-\neight calibre remark in the direction of the breath in the corner.",
        "When the echoes had died away a sigh of relief welled up from the dark\ncorner. Also another sigh of relief later on.",
        "I then decided to light the gas and fight it out. You have no doubt seen a\nman scratch a match on the leg of his pantaloons. Perhaps you have also\nseen an absent-minded man undertake to do so, forgetting that his\npantaloons were hanging on a chair at the other end of the room.",
        "However, I lit the gas with my left hand and kept my revolver pointed\ntoward the dark corner where the breath was still rising and falling.",
        "People who had heard my lecture came rushing in, hoping to find that I had\nsuicided, but they found that, instead of humoring the public in that way,\nI had shot the valve off the steam radiator.",
        "It is humiliating to write the foregoing myself, but I would rather do so\nthan have the affair garbled by careless hands.",
