        "BEYOND THE DOOR",
        "Ryder had stood stock still with amazement when the girl began to\nscream. She had gone mad, he thought for an instant, in masculine\nbewilderment, and then her madness revealed its treacherous cunning,\nfor she began crying wildly for help against an invader, an infidel,\na dog of a Christian who had stolen into her rooms.",
        "She had chucked him to the lions, Ryder perceived; one furious flash\nof lightning jealousy and Oriental anger had overthrown, in that\nwild and lawless head, every other design for him for which she had\nrisked so much.",
        "He had scorned her.... He had flouted her caprice.... He had dared\nto refuse the languors of those dangerous eyes....",
        "The hurrying footsteps appeared to him the tread of a legion in\naction, and he had no desire to rush out upon the oncomers; he had,\nindeed, distinct doubts of his ruthless ability to pass that supple,\nclawing, incensed creature at the door.",
        "He whirled and made a bolt for the window, striking at the fastened\ngrill. He heard the snapping of wooden bolts and the splintering of\nwood and out through the hole he climbed to a precipitous, head-long\nflight that fairly felt the clutching hands upon his ankle.",
        "He had meant to make a jump for it. A three-story plunge into the\nNile appeared a gentle exercise compared to the alternative within\nthe palace, but in the very act of releasing his hold he changed his\nmind.",
        "Quicker than he had ever moved before, in any vicissitude of his\nlithe and agile youth, he clambered up, not down, and crouching back\nfrom sight upon the jutting top of the window, he sent his coat\nsailing violently through space.",
        "He dared not look over for its descent upon the water, for other\nheads were peering from below and he could hear an excited outburst\nof speech, that broke sharply off.",
        "Evidently they were hurrying down to the water gate. Swiftly he\nutilized this misdirection for his own ends.",
        "The roofs. That was the refuge to make for. Flat, long-reaching\nroofs, from which one could climb off onto a wall or a palm or a\nside street.",
        "He had only a story to ascend and he made it in record time, fearful\nthat the searchers whom he heard now launching a boat below would\nturn their eyes skywards.",
        "But he gained the top without an outcry being raised and found\nhimself upon the roof where the ladies of the harem took their air\nunseen of any save the blind eyes of the muezzin in the Sultan\nmosque upon the hill. There were divans and a little taboret or two\nand a framework where an awning could be raised against the sun.",
        "There was also a trap door.",
        "And here, tempestuously he changed his mind again. He abandoned the\ngoal of outer walls and chances of escape. He wrenched violently at\nthat trap door. It was bolted but the bolt was an ancient one and\ngave at his furious exertions, letting him down into a narrow spiral\nstaircase between walls.",
        "Down he plunged in haste, before some confused searcher should dash\nup. It was no place to meet an opposing force. Nor was the corridor\nin which he found himself much better.",
        "It was black and baffling as a labyrinth, with unexpected turnings,\nand he kept gingerly close to the wall with one hand clutching a bit\nof iron which he had taken into his possession and his pocket when\nAziza had led him out of the underground walls–the very bit of\npointed iron, it was, with which the volatile creature had effected\nhis rescue.",
        "He considered it an invaluable souvenir and twice, in his nervous\napprehension, he almost brought it down upon shadows.",
        "Direction he judged vaguely by the screaming which was still going\non at a tremendous rate–evidently the girl had gone off into\ngenuine hysterics or else she had determined not to leave her\nagitation at the intrusion in any manner of question. No doubt the\noutcries were a relief to her mingled emotions–remorse at her\nimpetuosity and chagrin that her thwarted plans might conceivably be\nnow among those emotions–and since the vicinity of those shrieks\nmust be a gathering place to be avoided by him he stole on, down the\nupper hall, and finding a stair, he went down for two continuous\nflights.",
        "Aimée’s rooms, he knew, had been upon the water, and recalling the\ngeneral direction of those two lighted windows that he had seen so\nrecently from without, his excavator’s instinct led him on. Once he\nsaw the flitting figure of a turbaned woman in time to draw back\ninto a heaven-sent niche and again he flattened into a soundless\nshadow against the wall as two young serving girls ran by on\nslippered feet, their anklets tinkling, chattering to each other in\ndelighted excitement.",
        "And then the stealthy opening of a door–it was the very door by\nwhich Yussuf had precipitated himself upon the struggle at the\nsupper table some age-long hours ago–gave him a glimpse into the\nfar glooms of the reception room, where its long side of mashrubiyeh\nwindows revealed now between its fretwork tiny chinks of a paling\nsky.",
        "He could make out the dark-draped marriage throne and the pallor of\nthe disordered cloth upon the abandoned table below, and behind the\ntable the dark draperies of the remaining portières before the\ndoorway into the boudoir where he had hidden himself and into which\nhe had last seen Aimée thrust.",
        "At the other end of the great room were the entrance stairs to the\nharem, and there, he imagined, a watchman was stationed, or else\nstout bolts and bars were guarding the situation. There remained an\narched doorway into other formal rooms through which he had seen\nAimée and the guests disappear for the wedding supper, and that way\nled, he surmised, down into the service quarters.",
        "A sorry choice of exits! He could form no plan in advance but trust\nblindly to the amazing chances of adventure. And first, before he\nrushed for escape, there was Aimée to find.",
        "Yet for all the mad hazard of the situation he was elated with life.\nHe felt as if he had never fully lived until now, when every breath\nwas informed with the sharp prescience of danger. He was at once\ncool and exultant, wary yet reckless, with the joyous recklessness\nof utter desperation.",
        "With cat-like care he surveyed the drawing-room; it appeared\ndeserted but as he watched his tense nerves could see the shadows\nforming, taking furtive, crouching shape–and then dissolving\nharmlessly into a rug, a chair, or a stirring drapery. His eyes\ngrown used to the dimness he identified the mantle upon the floor in\nwhich he had come and which he had extended to Aimée in that brief\nmoment of fatuous triumph, and beyond it, across a chair, was the\nportière which the black had torn down from the doorway to wrap\nabout Ryder’s helpless form as he had carried him down to living\ndeath.",
        "That mantle, he thought, might yet be useful, and he stole forward\nand recovered it, but, as he straightened, another shadow darted out\nfrom the boudoir door and silhouetted for an instant against the\nlighted, room he saw a figure in a long, swinging military cloak.",
        "Discovery was inevitable and Ryder made a swift plunge to take the\ncloaked figure by surprise, but even as one hand shot out and\ngripped the throat while the other held his threatening iron aloft,\nhis clutch relaxed, his arm fell nervelessly at his side.",
        "For from the figure had come the broken gasp of a soft voice, and\nthe face upturned to his was a pale oval under dark, disordered\nhair.",
        "“Aimée!” he breathed in exultant, still half-incredulous joy.\n“Aimée!... Did I hurt you–?”",
        "“Oh, no, no!” came Aimée’s shaken voice. “Oh, you are safe!”",
        "He felt her trembling in his clasp and he swept her close to him.\nFor one breathless instant they clung together, in a sharp,\npassionate gladness which blurred every sense of dread or danger.\nThey were safe–they were together–and for the moment it was\nenough. Every obstacle was surmounted, every terror conquered.",
        "They clung, obliviously, like children, her pale face against his\nshoulder, her hair brushing his lips, her wild heartbeats throbbing\nagainst his own.",
        "Then the girl, remembering, lifted her head.",
        "“Quick–we must go,” she whispered. “For there I made a fire–”",
        "He fallowed her frightened, backward glance at the boudoir door and\nsuddenly saw its cracks and key hole strangely radiant with light.",
        "“He left me, to go to those screams,” she was saying rapidly. “I\ntried to run that way–and found that woman coming back. And I told\nher to wait–in her own room–and I slipped back in there–and\nsuddenly it came to me to thrust the candle about. I thought I would\nrun out and if I met any one I would call, ’Fire’, and say the\ngeneral was burning and perhaps in the confusion–”",
        "The terrible desperation of her both stirred and wrung him. She was\nso little, so helpless, so trembling in his clasp ... so made for\nlove and tenderness.... And to think of her in such fear and horror\nthat she went thrusting reckless candles into her hangings, setting\na palace on fire in the blind fury for escape....",
        "To such work had this night brought her.... This night, and three\nmen–for he and the craven Tewfick and the fanatic bey were all\nlinked in this night’s work. Yes, and another man–and he thought\nswiftly, in a lightning flash of wonder, how little that Paul\nDelcassé had known when he set his eager face toward the Old World,\nwith his wife and baby with him, that he was setting his feet into\nsuch a web ... that his wife would die, languishing in a pasha’s\nharem, and his little daughter would one night be flying in mad\nterror from the cruel beast the weak pasha had sold her to!",
        "And how little, for that matter, he had known when he had set his\nown face toward those same sands what secrets he would discover\nthere and what forbidden ways his heart would know.",
        "These thoughts all went through him like one thought, in some clear,\nremote background of his mind, while he was swiftly drawing on the\nmilitary cloak she gave him and wrapping her in the black mantle.\nThere was a veil on the mantle’s hood that she could fling across\nher face when she wished, but Ryder had no fez to complete the\ndeceptive outline of his masquerade. He must trust to the dark and\nto the concealment of the high, military collar of the cloak.",
        "“Do you know a way?” he whispered and at her shaken head, “The water\ngate,” he said, thinking swiftly.",
        "There would be a crowd now about the gate, but if they could only\nmanage to gain those cellars and hide somewhere they could steal out\nlater upon that waterman.",
        "It seemed the most feasible of all the desperate plans. The roofs\nmight be a trap. The harem entrance led into a garden and the garden\nwas guarded by an impassable wall. But if he could only get to the\nriver he knew that he was a strong enough swimmer to save Aimée, or\nhe might even terrorize the watchman into furnishing a boat.",
        "She did not question but guided him swiftly through the arch that\nled down into the banqueting hall. Twice that day she had gone down\nthose stairs. Once in her bridal state, her eyes shining, her cheeks\nglowing with the wild joy of Ryder’s arrival and dreams of escape,\nand again, scarcely an hour gone by, she had descended them, tense\nand desperate, her revolver at the general’s head, seeking vainly\nRyder’s rescue.",
        "And now a third time, a guilty, reckless fugitive in the night, she\nstole down those stairs into the many-columned hall where she had\nbeen fêted in state among her guests. Here her only knowledge was of\nthe stone corridor and the locked door through which the bey had led\nher, but Ryder knew the way that Aziza had brought him and he turned\ncautiously toward those wide, curving stairs.",
        "Keeping Aimée a few steps behind him, he went down the soft carpet\nand peered out at the bottom towards the water gate. He saw no bars;\nthe gate was open and against the pale square of the water were the\nblack silhouettes of the general and the gateman, both leaning out\nat some splashing in the river.",
        "He knew a boy’s reckless impulse to shove them both in. It was an\nunholy thought his better judgment rejected–unless driven to\nit–yet some prankish element in his roused recklessness would not\nhave deplored the necessity.",
        "If they looked about–!",
        "But they did not stir as, with Aimée’s cold hand in his, he made the\ntiptoed descent and slipped softly about the corner of the steps.\nThen, instead of going on down the hall to some hiding place in the\nruins, he took a suddenly revealed, sharper turn into a narrow\npassage just beyond the stairs.",
        "It might lead to another gate, some service entrance, perhaps, it\nran so straight and direct between its walls.",
        "Intuitively that excavator’s sense of his defined the direction.\nThey were going parallel with the river, although a little way back\nfrom the water wall, and in the direction of the men’s part of the\npalace, the selamlik.",
        "He recalled the selamlik vaguely as an irregular mass of buildings,\nand though the formal entrance was of course through the garden from\nthe avenue, there was a narrow side street or lane leading back to\nthe water’s edge between this part of the palace and the nest\nbuilding, and very likely there was some entrance on that lane.",
        "Bitterly he blamed himself for his lack of complete inspection that\nmorning. To be sure he had told himself, then, as he strolled about\nthe high garden walls and peered down the narrow lane on one side of\nthe Nile backwaters, that he didn’t need a map of the place for his\narrival at an afternoon reception; he was simply going in and out,\nand clothes and speech were his only real concern.",
        "He had even said to himself that he might not reveal himself to\nAimée–if she did not discover him. He wanted merely to see her\nagain, and be sure that she understood her own history–he had no\nnotion of attempting any further relations with her, any resumption\nof their forbidden and dangerous acquaintance.",
        "And it was true that had been the defiant and protesting surface of\nhis thoughts, but deep within himself there had always been that\nhot, hidden spark, ready to kindle to a flame at her word–and with\nit the unowned, secret longing that she would speak the word.",
        "And when she had called on him for help, when the trembling appeal\nhad sprung past her stricken pride, and he had seen the terror in\nher soft, child’s eyes, then the spark had struck its conflagration.\nHe had become nothing but a hot, headstrong fury of devotion.",
        "And he said to himself now that he might have known it was going to\nhappen, and that if he had not been so concerned that morning about\nsaving his face and preserving this fiction of indifference he would\nknow a little more about the labyrinth they were poking about\nin–the little more that tips the scale between safety and\ndestruction.",
        "But he did not know and blind Chance was his only goddess.",
        "The passage had brought him to a wall and a narrow stairs while\nanother passage led off to the right, apparently to the forward\nregions of the place.",
        "He took the stairs. He had had enough of underground regions when\nthey did not lead to water gates and the stairs promised novelty at\nleast.",
        "He wished he knew more about Turkish palaces. He supposed they had a\nfairly consistent ground plan, but beyond a few main features of\ninner courts and halls he was culpably ignorant of their intentions.\nIf it were an early Egyptian tomb or temple now! But then, perhaps\nthe Turks were more indefinite in their building and rebuilding.",
        "At the head of the stairs a door stood half ajar. Through the crack\nhe strained his eyes, but his anxious glance met only the darkness\nof utter night. Not a gleam of light. And not a sound–except the\nfar, hollow stamping of some stabled horse.",
        "Softly he pushed the door open and he and Aimée slipped within. The\nplace, whatever it was, appeared deserted, a dark, bare, backstairs\nregion–for he stumbled over a bucket–from which to the right he\ncould just discern a hall leading into the forward part of the\npalace, wanly lighted some distance on, with the pale flicker of an\nold ceiling lamp.",
        "They seemed to be at the end of the hall and the darker shadows in\nthe walls about them appeared to be a number of doors–closed, so\nhis groping hands informed him.",
        "Oh, for his excavator’s steady light, or a pocket flash! Oh, for a\nlight of any kind, even a temporary match! But he dared not risk the\nscratch, for now he caught the thud of footfalls overhead, heavy\nfootfalls, and there might be stairs unexpectedly close at hand.",
        "He turned to Aimée but the girl shook her head helplessly and\nhesitant and dashed, for all their young confidence, they wavered a\nmoment hand in hand in the dark, fearful of what a rash move might\nbring upon them. And in the beating stillness Ryder became conscious\nthat the muffled, monotonous stamping of a horse is a gloomy,\ndisheartening thing in the night, and that footsteps overhead are of\nall noises the most nervous and unsettling.",
        "What was behind those doors? Not a spark of light came from them,\nthat was one comfort. The rooms, kitchen, service, store rooms or\nwhatever they were, appeared in the same blackness and oblivion....\nBut any door might open on a roomful of sleeping gardeners and\ngrooms....",
        "Life and more than life hung on the blind goddess.",
        "It was only an instant that they hesitated there, yet it appeared an\neternity of indecision, then nearer footsteps sounded, coming down\nthat hall. No more wavering of the scales!",
        "Ryder turned to the door at his left, at the very end of the wall\nbeyond which came that far stamping, and wrenched it open, closing\nit swiftly behind him. He saw a light now, a mild, yellow ray\nthrough an opened door ahead that vaguely illumined the strange old\nvehicles of the palace, and the stables were beyond.",
        "Some one else was beyond, too, in the stables, for that very instant\nhe saw a black horse backed restively into sight, its tossing head\nevading the hands that were trying to bridle it.",
        "“The Fortieth Door!” said Ryder to himself with an involuntary\nthrust of humor.",
        "The door of the horse! The door of forbidden daring! He knew now the\nvague associations that had stirred in him as he had stared blindly\nabout that place of doors.... But he had opened so many forbidden\ndoors of late that this last was welcome as the supreme test.",
        "And nothing in the world could have been more welcome than a\nhorse–a horse with a way out behind it!",
        "“Stay back,” he said under his breath to Aimée, and clasping his bit\nof iron he moved toward the door.",
        "He could see the attendant now, who was finishing his bridling, and\nit was Yussuf, the eunuch, so busy gentling and soothing the horse\nthat he cast only one glance in the direction of the sounds he heard\nand that one glance misled him in its glimpse of the general’s\ncloak.",
        "“By your favor–but an instant,” he called out, “and he is ready–”",
        "“Stand aside,” said Ryder very clearly, emerging from the shadows at\nthe horse’s heels. “Out of the way with you. The horse is for me.”",
        "A moment Yussuf gaped. Then he dropped the bridle and his hand went\nswiftly to the knife hilt in his belt.",
        "“Fool!” said Ryder contemptuously. “Would you tempt fate? Do you\nthink I am such that your knife could harm me? Must I prove to you\nagain that walls are nothings–that I but let myself be taken to\nprove my powers?”",
        "Ethiopians are superstitious. And Yussuf knew that his brick and\nmortar had been strong.... Yet they have great trust in a crooked,\nshort-bladed knife, and Yussuf did not relax his hold upon his and\nfor all that Ryder could See there was no hesitation in the grinning\nferocity of his black face.",
        "Yet his spring was an instant delayed and in that instant Ryder\nspoke again.",
        "“Look, now at the wall behind you,” he said quickly.",
        "Yussuf looked. And as he turned his bullet head Ryder jumped close\nand brought his iron down upon it with a sickening force he thought\nscarcely short of murder.",
        "To his amazement the black did not fall, but staggered only, and\nRyder had need to send the knife spinning from his grasp and strike\nagain before the eunuch’s knees sagged and his huge bulk sank at\nRyder’s feet.",
        "This time Ryder took no chance with a shammed unconsciousness. He\nsnatched down bits of leather from the wall and bound the man’s\nhands and feet in tight security and seeing that he was breathing,\nalthough heavily, he thrust a gagging handkerchief into his mouth.",
        "Then he dragged the heavy body towards a pile of hay he saw\nin a vacant stall and concealed it effectively but not too\nsmotheringly–although Yussuf, he felt, would be no grievous loss\nto society.",
        "Vaguely in the back of his consciousness he had been aware of the\nexcited plunge of the horse and then of a low, soothing murmur of\nspeech, and now he turned to find Aimée holding the bridle and\nstroking the quivering creature with gentle, fearless hands.",
        "“Is he dead?” she asked quietly of the eunuch.",
        "“Stunned,” said Ryder, meaning reassurement and was startled by the\npassion of her cry, “Oh, I could kill them all–all!”",
        "“I will–if they try to stop us,” he promised grimly, forgetful of\nthat oath to Aziza.",
        "Hastily he glanced about the stalls. There was no other horse there,\nonly a pair of mild-eyed donkeys, and though there might conceivably\nbe other horses behind other doors there was no instant to spare in\nsearch.",
        "This luck was too prodigious to risk.",
        "The door to the street had already been unbolted and now he threw\nit back with a quick look into the dark emptiness of the narrow side\nstreet, and then, with a tight hold of the reins, he swung himself\ninto the saddle and Aimée up into his arms, her head on his\nshoulder, her arms clasping him.",
        "It was a huge Bedouin saddle with high-arched back and curved pummel\nand the slender pair no more than filled it, making apparently no\nweight at all for the spirited beast which tore out of the stalls at\nthe charging gallop beloved of Eastern horsemen.",
        "For a moment Ryder felt wildly that he might meet the fate of the\nrash youth in his patron story. He had never ridden a horse like\nthis, which, like all high-mettled Arabs, resented the authority of\nany but his master, and though a good horseman Ryder had all he\ncould do to keep his seat and Aimée in his arms.",
        "Around the corner of the lane the horse went racing, and down the\ndark, lebbek-lined avenue his flying feet struck back their sparks\nof fire. Across an open square he plunged, while irate camels\nscreamed at him and a harsh voice shouted back loud curses. It\nseemed to Ryder that other voices joined in–that there was a\npursuit, an outcry–and then they were out down an open road, wildly\ngalloping, like a mad highwayman under a pale morning sky.",
