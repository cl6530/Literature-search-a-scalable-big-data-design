        "In a lovely green hollow, surrounded by splendid old trees and velvet\nturf, stands Ightham Mote, a gem among old English moated manor-houses.\nIt is the home of Mr. J.C. Colyer-Fergusson, who allows the public to\nsee the house and grounds on Fridays, between 11 and 1, and 2 and 6. A\ncharge of 6d. is made.",
        "Crossing a bridge over the moat, one enters the courtyard of the house\nthrough the great Tudor gate illustrated here. Standing in this\ncourtyard one can scarcely imagine anything more beautiful and\npicturesque. The great square battlemented tower, through which one has\njust passed, is pierced with leaded windows, and its weather-beaten old\nwalls are relieved by all sorts of creepers, which have been allowed to\nadorn without destroying the rich detail of stone and half-timber work.\nThose who find pleasure in gazing on architectural picturesqueness can\nsatisfy themselves in the richness of colour and detail revealed in this\nbeautiful courtyard. The crypt with its fine groined roof, the chapel\nwhich dates from 1520, the drawing-room with its two hundred years old\nChinese wall-paper–believed to be one of the earliest occasions when\nwall-papers were used in this country–and many other interesting\nfeatures are shown to visitors.",
        "The original Ightham Mote seems to have been built in 1180 by Sir Ivo de\nHaut. The Hall, it is known, was built by Sir Thomas Cawne in 1340.\nRichard de Haut, who owned the place later on, was beheaded in 1484 at\nPontefract. His estate was confiscated and came into the hands of Sir\nRobert Brackenbury, governor of the Tower, who lost his life at the\nbattle of Bosworth. However, during the reign of Henry VII., Ightham\nonce more came into the possession of the de Hauts; and it should be\nmentioned that throughout the seven centuries of its existence the house\nhas always been inhabited.",
