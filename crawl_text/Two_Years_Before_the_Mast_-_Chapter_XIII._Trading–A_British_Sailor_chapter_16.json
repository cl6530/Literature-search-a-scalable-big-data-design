        "The next day, the cargo having been entered in due form, we began\ntrading.  The trade-room was fitted up in the steerage, and furnished\nout with the lighter goods, and with specimens of the rest of the\ncargo; and M––-, a young man who came out from Boston with us,\nbefore the mast, was taken out of the forecastle, and made supercargo’s\nclerk.  He was well qualified for the business, having been clerk in a\ncounting-house in Boston.  He had been troubled for some time with\nthe rheumatism, which unfitted him for the wet and exposed duty of\na sailor on the coast.  For a week or ten days all was life on board.\nThe people came off to look and to buy–men, women, and children;\nand we were continually going in the boats, carrying goods and\npassengers,–for they have no boats of their own.  Everything must\ndress itself and come aboard and see the new vessel, if it were only\nto buy a paper of pins.  The agent and his clerk managed the sales,\nwhile we were busy in the hold or in the boats.  Our cargo was an\nassorted one; that is, it consisted of everything under the sun.\nWe had spirits of all kinds, (sold by the cask,) teas, coffee, sugars,\nspices, raisins, molasses, hardware, crockery-ware, tinware, cutlery,\nclothing of all kinds, boots and shoes from Lynn, calicoes and cottons\nfrom Lowell, crepes, silks; also shawls, scarfs, necklaces, jewelry,\nand combs for the ladies; furniture; and in fact, everything that can\nbe imagined, from Chinese fire-works to English cart-wheels–of which\nwe had a dozen pairs with their iron rims on.",
        "The Californians are an idle, thriftless people, and can make \nnothing for themselves.  The country abounds in grapes, yet they\nbuy bad wines made in Boston and brought round by us, at an immense\nprice, and retail it among themselves at a real (12½ cents) by\nthe small wine-glass.  Their hides, too, which they value at two\ndollars in money, they give for something which costs seventy-five\ncents in Boston; and buy shoes (like as not, made of their own hides,\nand which have been carried twice around Cape Horn) at three or\nfour dollars, and “chicken-skin” boots at fifteen dollars apiece.\nThings sell, on an average, at an advance of nearly three hundred\nper cent upon the Boston prices.  This is partly owing to the heavy\nduties which the government, in their wisdom, with the intent, no\ndoubt, of keeping the silver in the country, has laid upon imports.\nThese duties, and the enormous expenses of so long a voyage, keep\nall merchants, but those of heavy capital, from engaging in the\ntrade.  Nearly two-thirds of all the articles imported into the\ncountry from round Cape Horn, for the last six years, have been by\nthe single house of Bryant, Sturgis & Co., to whom our vessel belonged,\nand who have a permanent agent on the coast.",
        "This kind of business was new to us, and we liked it very well for\na few days, though we were hard at work every minute from daylight\nto dark; and sometimes even later.",
        "By being thus continually engaged in transporting passengers with\ntheir goods, to and fro, we gained considerable knowledge of the\ncharacter, dress, and language of the people.  The dress of the\nmen was as I have before described it.  The women wore gowns of\nvarious texture–silks, crape, calicoes, etc.,–made after the\nEuropean style, except that the sleeves were short, leaving the arm\nbare, and that they were loose about the waist, having no corsets.\nThey wore shoes of kid, or satin; sashes or belts of bright colors;\nand almost always a necklace and ear-rings.  Bonnets they had none.\nI only saw one on the coast, and that belonged to the wife of an\nAmerican sea-captain who had settled in San Diego, and had imported\nthe chaotic mass of straw and ribbon, as a choice present to his\nnew wife.  They wear their hair (which is almost invariably black,\nor a very dark brown) long in their necks, sometimes loose,\nand sometimes in long braids; though the married women often\ndo it up on a high comb.  Their only protection against the sun\nand weather is a large mantle which they put over their heads,\ndrawing it close round their faces, when they go out of doors,\nwhich is generally only in pleasant weather.  When in the house,\nor sitting out in front of it, which they often do in fine weather,\nthey usually wear a small scarf or neckerchief of a rich pattern.\nA band, also, about the top of the head, with a cross, star, or\nother ornament in front, is common.  Their complexions are various,\ndepending–as well as their dress and manner–upon their rank; or,\nin other words, upon the amount of Spanish blood they can lay claim to.\nThose who are of pure Spanish blood, having never intermarried with\nthe aborigines, have clear brunette complexions, and sometimes, even\nas fair as those of English women.  There are but few of these families\nin California; being mostly those in official stations, or who, on the\nexpiration of their offices, have settled here upon property which they\nhave acquired; and others who have been banished for state offences.\nThese form the aristocracy; inter-marrying, and keeping up an exclusive\nsystem in every respect.  They can be told by their complexions, dress,\nmanner, and also by their speech; for, calling themselves Castilians,\nthey are very ambitious of speaking the pure Castilian language,\nwhich is spoken in a somewhat corrupted dialect by the lower\nclasses.  From this upper class, they go down by regular shades,\ngrowing more and more dark and muddy, until you come to the pure\nIndian, who runs about with nothing upon him but a small piece\nof cloth, kept up by a wide leather strap drawn round his waist.\nGenerally speaking, each person’s caste is decided by the quality\nof the blood, which shows itself, too plainly to be concealed,\nat first sight.  Yet the least drop of Spanish blood, if it be\nonly of quadroon or octoroon, is sufficient to raise them from\nthe rank of slaves, and entitle them to a suit of clothes–boots,\nhat, cloak, spurs, long knife, and all complete, though coarse\nand dirty as may be,–and to call themselves Españolos, and to\nhold property, if they can get any.",
        "The fondness for dress among the women is excessive, and is often\nthe ruin of many of them.  A present of a fine mantle, or of a\nnecklace or pair of ear-rings, gains the favor of the greater part\nof them.  Nothing is more common than to see a woman living in\na house of only two rooms, and the ground for a floor, dressed in\nspangled satin shoes, silk gown, high comb, and gilt, if not gold,\near-rings and necklace.  If their husbands do not dress them well\nenough, they will soon receive presents from others.  They used to\nspend whole days on board our vessels, examining the fine clothes\nand ornaments, and frequently made purchases at a rate which\nwould have made a seamstress or waiting-maid in Boston open\nher eyes.",
        "Next to the love of dress, I was most struck with the fineness of\nthe voices and beauty of the intonations of both sexes.  Every\ncommon ruffian-looking fellow, with a slouched hat, blanket cloak,\ndirty under-dress, and soiled leather leggins, appeared to me to be\nspeaking elegant Spanish.  It was a pleasure, simply to listen to\nthe sound of the language, before I could attach any meaning to it.\nThey have a good deal of the Creole drawl, but it is varied with an\noccasional extreme rapidity of utterance, in which they seem to skip\nfrom consonant to consonant, until, lighting upon a broad, open\nvowel, they rest upon that to restore the balance of sound.  The\nwomen carry this peculiarity of speaking to a much greater extreme\nthan the men, who have more evenness and stateliness of utterance.\nA common bullock-driver, on horseback, delivering a message, seemed\nto speak like an ambassador at an audience.  In fact, they sometimes\nappeared to me to be a people on whom a curse had fallen, and stripped\nthem of everything but their pride, their manners, and their voices.",
        "Another thing that surprised me was the quantity of silver that\nwas in circulation.  I certainly never saw so much silver at one\ntime in my life, as during the week that we were at Monterey.\nThe truth is, they have no credit system, no banks, and no way\nof investing money but in cattle.  They have no circulating medium\nbut silver and hides–which the sailors call “California bank notes.\"\nEverything that they buy they must pay for in one or the other of\nthese things.  The hides they bring down dried and doubled, in\nclumsy ox-carts, or upon mules’ backs, and the money they carry\ntied up in a handkerchief;–fifty, eighty, or an hundred dollars\nand half dollars.",
        "I had never studied Spanish while at college, and could not speak\na word, when at Juan Fernandez; but during the latter part of the\npassage out, I borrowed a grammar and dictionary from the cabin,\nand by a continual use of these, and a careful attention to every word\nthat I heard spoken, I soon got a vocabulary together, and began\ntalking for myself.  As I soon knew more Spanish than any of the\ncrew, (who indeed knew none at all,) and had been at college and\nknew Latin, I got the name of a great linguist, and was always sent\nfor by the captain and officers to get provisions, or to carry letters\nand messages to different parts of the town.  I was often sent to get\nsomething which I could not tell the name of to save my life; but\nI liked the business, and accordingly never pleaded ignorance.\nSometimes I managed to jump below and take a look at my dictionary\nbefore going ashore; or else I overhauled some English resident\non my way, and got the word from him; and then, by signs, and the\nhelp of my Latin and French, contrived to get along.  This was a\ngood exercise for me, and no doubt taught me more than I should\nhave learned by months of study and reading; it also gave me\nopportunities of seeing the customs, characters, and domestic\narrangements of the people; beside being a great relief from\nthe monotony of a day spent on board ship.",
        "Monterey, as far as my observation goes, is decidedly the pleasantest\nand most civilized-looking place in California.  In the centre\nof it is an open square, surrounded by four lines of one-story\nplastered buildings, with half a dozen cannon in the centre; some\nmounted, and others not.  This is the “Presidio,” or fort.  Every\ntown has a presidio in its centre; or rather, every presidio has a\ntown built around it; for the forts were first built by the Mexican\ngovernment, and then the people built near them for protection.  The\npresidio here was entirely open and unfortified.  There were several\nofficers with long titles, and about eighty soldiers, but they were\npoorly paid, fed, clothed, and disciplined.  The governor-general,\nor, as he is commonly called, the “general,” lives here; which makes\nit the seat of government.  He is appointed by the central government\nat Mexico, and is the chief civil and military officer.  In addition to\nhim, each town has a commandant, who is the chief military officer,\nand has charge of the fort, and of all transactions with foreigners\nand foreign vessels; and two or three alcaldes and corregidores,\nelected by the inhabitants, who are the civil officers.  Courts and\njurisprudence they have no knowledge of.  Small municipal matters are\nregulated by the alcaldes and corregidores; and everything relating\nto the general government, to the military, and to foreigners,\nby the commandants, acting under the governor-general.  Capital\ncases are decided by him, upon personal inspection, if he is near;\nor upon minutes sent by the proper officers, if the offender is at a\ndistant place.  No Protestant has any civil rights, nor can he hold\nany property, or, indeed, remain more than a few weeks on shore,\nunless he belong to some vessel.  Consequently, the Americans and\nEnglish who intend to remain here become Catholics, to a man;\nthe current phrase among them being,–\"A man must leave his\nconscience at Cape Horn.”",
        "But to return to Monterey.  The houses here, as everywhere else\nin California, are of one story, built of clay made into large bricks,\nabout a foot and a half square and three or four inches thick, and\nhardened in the sun.  These are cemented together by mortar of the\nsame material, and the whole are of a common dirt-color.  The floors\nare generally of earth, the windows grated and without glass; and\nthe doors, which are seldom shut, open directly into the common\nroom; there being no entries.  Some of the more wealthy inhabitants\nhave glass to their windows and board floors; and in Monterey\nnearly all the houses are plastered on the outside.  The better houses,\ntoo, have red tiles upon the roofs.  The common ones have two or\nthree rooms which open into each other, and are furnished with a\nbed or two, a few chairs and tables, a looking-glass, a crucifix of\nsome material or other, and small daubs of paintings enclosed in\nglass, and representing some miracle or martyrdom.  They have no\nchimneys or fire-places in the houses, the climate being such as to\nmake a fire unnecessary; and all their cooking is done in a small\ncook-house, separated from the house.  The Indians, as I have said\nbefore, do all the hard work, two or three being attached to each\nhouse; and the poorest persons are able to keep one, at least, for\nthey have only to feed them and give them a small piece of coarse\ncloth and a belt, for the males; and a coarse gown, without shoes\nor stockings, for the females.",
        "In Monterey there are a number of English and Americans (English\nor “Ingles” all are called who speak the English language) who\nhave married Californians, become united to the Catholic church,\nand acquired considerable property.  Having more industry, frugality,\nand enterprise than the natives, they soon get nearly all the\ntrade into their hands.  They usually keep shops, in which they\nretail the goods purchased in larger quantities from our vessels,\nand also send a good deal into the interior, taking hides in pay,\nwhich they again barter with our vessels.  In every town on the coast\nthere are foreigners engaged in this kind of trade, while I recollect\nbut two shops kept by natives.  The people are generally suspicious\nof foreigners, and they would not be allowed to remain, were it not\nthat they become good Catholics, and by marrying natives, and\nbringing up their children as Catholics and Mexicans, and not\nteaching them the English language, they quiet suspicion, and even\nbecome popular and leading men.  The chief alcaldes in Monterey and\nSanta Barbara were both Yankees by birth.",
        "The men in Monterey appeared to me to be always on horseback.\nHorses are as abundant here as dogs and chickens were in Juan\nFernandez. There are no stables to keep them in, but they are\nallowed to run wild and graze wherever they please, being branded,\nand having long leather ropes, called “lassos,” attached to their\nnecks and dragging along behind them, by which they can be easily\ntaken.  The men usually catch one in the morning, throw a saddle and\nbridle upon him, and use him for the day, and let him go at night,\ncatching another the next day.  When they go on long journeys,\nthey ride one horse down, and catch another, throw the saddle and\nbridle upon him, and after riding him down, take a third, and so\non to the end of the journey.  There are probably no better riders\nin the world.  They get upon a horse when only four or five years\nold, their little legs not long enough to come half way over his\nsides; and may almost be said to keep on him until they have grown\nto him.  The stirrups are covered or boxed up in front, to prevent\ntheir catching when riding through the woods; and the saddles are\nlarge and heavy, strapped very tight upon the horse, and have\nlarge pommels, or loggerheads, in front, round which the “lasso\"\nis coiled when not in use.  They can hardly go from one house to\nanother without getting on a horse, there being generally several\nstanding tied to the door-posts of the little cottages.  When they\nwish to show their activity, they make no use of their stirrups\nin mounting, but striking the horse, spring into the saddle as\nhe starts, and sticking their long spurs into him, go off on\nthe full run.  Their spurs are cruel things, having four or five\nrowels, each an inch in length, dull and rusty.  The flanks of\nthe horses are often sore from them, and I have seen men come in\nfrom chasing bullocks with their horses’ hind legs and quarters\ncovered with blood.  They frequently give exhibitions of their\nhorsemanship, in races, bull-baitings, etc.; but as we were not\nashore during any holyday, we saw nothing of it.  Monterey is also\na great place for cock-fighting, gambling of all sorts, fandangos,\nand every kind of amusement and knavery.  Trappers and hunters, who\noccasionally arrive here from over the Rocky mountains, with their\nvaluable skins and furs, are often entertained with every sort of\namusement and dissipation, until they have wasted their time and\ntheir money, and go back, stripped of everything.",
        "Nothing but the character of the people prevents Monterey from\nbecoming a great town.  The soil is as rich as man could wish;\nclimate as good as any in the world; water abundant, and situation\nextremely beautiful.  The harbor, too, is a good one, being subject\nonly to one bad wind, the north; and though the holding-ground is\nnot the best, yet I heard of but one vessel’s being driven ashore\nhere.  That was a Mexican brig, which went ashore a few months\nbefore our arrival, and was a total wreck, all the crew but one being\ndrowned.  Yet this was from the carelessness or ignorance of the\ncaptain, who paid out all his small cable before he let go his other\nanchor.  The ship Lagoda, of Boston, was there at the time, and rode\nout the gale in safety, without dragging at all, or finding it necessary\nto strike her top-gallant masts.",
        "The only vessel in port with us was the little Loriotte.  I frequently\nwent on board her, and became very well acquainted with her\nSandwich Island crew.  One of them could speak a little English,\nand from him I learned a good deal about them.  They were well\nformed and active, with black eyes, intelligent countenances,\ndark-olive, or, I should rather say, copper complexions and coarse\nblack hair, but not woolly like the negroes.  They appeared to be\ntalking continually.  In the forecastle there was a complete Babel.\nTheir language is extremely guttural, and not pleasant at first,\nbut improves as you hear it more, and is said to have great capacity.\nThey use a good deal of gesticulation, and are exceedingly animated,\nsaying with their might what their tongues find to say.  They are\ncomplete water-dogs, therefore very good in boating.  It is for this\nreason that there are so many of them on the coast of California;\nthey being very good hands in the surf.  They are also quick and\nactive in the rigging, and good hands in warm weather; but those\nwho have been with them round Cape Horn, and in high latitudes,\nsay that they are useless in cold weather.  In their dress they are\nprecisely like our sailors.  In addition to these Islanders, the vessel\nhad two English sailors, who acted as boatswains over the Islanders,\nand took care of the rigging.  One of them I shall always remember as\nthe best specimen of the thoroughbred English sailor that I ever saw.\nHe had been to sea from a boy, having served a regular apprenticeship\nof seven years, as all English sailors are obliged to do, and was\nthen about four or five and twenty.  He was tall; but you only\nperceived it when he was standing by the side of others, for the\ngreat breadth of his shoulders and chest made him appear but little\nabove the middle height.  His chest was as deep as it was wide;\nhis arm like that of Hercules; and his hand “the fist of a tar\n–every hair a rope-yarn.” With all this he had one of the pleasantest\nsmiles I ever saw.  His cheeks were of a handsome brown; his teeth\nbrilliantly white; and his hair, of a raven black, waved in loose\ncurls all over his head, and fine, open forehead; and his eyes\nhe might have sold to a duchess at the price of diamonds, for their\nbrilliancy.  As for their color, they were like the Irishman’s pig,\nwhich would not stay to be counted, every change of position and\nlight seemed to give them a new hue; but their prevailing color was\nblack, or nearly so.  Take him with his well-varnished black tarpaulin\nstuck upon the back of his head; his long locks coming down almost\ninto his eyes; his white duck trowsers and shirt; blue jacket;\nand black kerchief, tied loosely round his neck; and he was a fine\nspecimen of manly beauty.  On his broad chest he had stamped with\nIndia ink “Parting moments;\"–a ship ready to sail; a boat on the\nbeach; and a girl and her sailor lover taking their farewell.\nUnderneath were printed the initials of his own name, and two other\nletters, standing for some name which he knew better than I did.\nThis was very well done, having been executed by a man who made\nit his business to print with India ink, for sailors, at Havre.\nOn one of his broad arms, he had the crucifixion, and on the other\nthe sign of the “foul anchor.”",
        "He was very fond of reading, and we lent him most of the books\nwhich we had in the forecastle, which he read and returned\nto us the next time we fell in with him.  He had a good deal\nof information, and his captain said he was a perfect seaman,\nand worth his weight in gold on board a vessel, in fair weather\nand in foul.  His strength must have been great, and he had the\nsight of a vulture.  It is strange that one should be so minute in\nthe description of an unknown, outcast sailor, whom one may never\nsee again, and whom no one may care to hear about; but so it is.\nSome people we see under no remarkable circumstances, but whom,\nfor some reason or other, we never forget.  He called himself Bill\nJackson; and I know no one of all my accidental acquaintances to\nwhom I would more gladly give a shake of the hand than to him.\nWhoever falls in with him will find a handsome, hearty fellow,\nand a good shipmate.",
        "Sunday came again while we were at Monterey, but as before, it brought\nus no holyday.  The people on shore dressed themselves and came off in\ngreater numbers than ever, and we were employed all day in boating and\nbreaking out cargo, so that we had hardly time to eat.  Our cidevant\nsecond mate, who was determined to get liberty if it was to be had,\ndressed himself in a long coat and black hat, and polished his shoes,\nand went aft and asked to go ashore.  He could not have done a more\nimprudent thing; for he knew that no liberty would be given; and besides,\nsailors, however sure they may be of having liberty granted them always\ngo aft in their working clothes, to appear as though they had no reason\nto expect anything, and then wash, dress, and shave, after they get\ntheir liberty.  But this poor fellow was always getting into hot water,\nand if there was a wrong way of doing a thing, was sure to hit upon it.\nWe looked to see him go aft, knowing pretty well what his reception\nwould be.  The captain was walking the quarter-deck, smoking his\nmorning cigar, and F––- went as far as the break of the deck, and there\nwaited for him to notice him.  The captain took two or three turns,\nand then walking directly up to him, surveyed him from head to foot,\nand lifting up his forefinger, said a word or two, in a tone too low\nfor us to hear, but which had a magical effect upon poor F––-.\nHe walked forward, sprang into the forecastle, and in a moment more\nmade his appearance in his common clothes, and went quietly to work again.\nWhat the captain said to him, we never could get him to tell, but it\ncertainly changed him outwardly and inwardly in a most surprising manner.",
