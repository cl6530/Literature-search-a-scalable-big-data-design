        "THE COCHINEAL–THE ’GALLO’–CANARY ’SACK’–ADIEU TO THE CANARIES.",
        "I must not leave the Jezirát el-Bard (of Gold), or Jezirát el-Khálidát\n(Happy Islands), without some notice of their peculiar institutions, the\ncochineal, the gallo, and Canary ’sack.’",
        "The nopal or tunal plant (Opuntia Tuna or Cactus\ncochinellifera) is indigenous on these islands as well as on the\nmainland of Africa. But the native growth is woody and lean-leaved; and\nits cooling fruit, which we clumsily term a ’prickly pear’ or ’fig,’ is\neverywhere a favourite in hot climates. There are now sundry claimants\nto the honour of having here fathered the modern industry. Some say that\nin 1823 a retired intendant introduced from Mexico the true\nterciopelo, or velvet-leaf, together with the Mexican cochineal,\nthe coccus cacti hemipter, [Footnote: The male insect is winged\nfor flight. The female never stirs from the spot where she begins to\nfeed: she lays her eggs, which are innumerable and microscopic, and she\nleaves them in the membrane or hardened envelope which she has\nsecreted.] so called from the old Greek KÓKKOS, a berry, or the\nneo-Greek KOKKIVOS, red, scarlet. It is certain that Don Santiago\nde la Cruz brought both plant and ’bug’ from Guatemala or Honduras in\n1835; and that an Englishman, who has advanced a right even in writing,\nlabours under a not uncommon hallucination.",
        "But the early half of the present century was the palmy day of the\nvine. The people resisted the cactus-innovation as the English labourer\ndid the introduction of machinery, and tore up the plants. Enough,\nhowever, remained in the south of Tenerife for the hour of\nneed. Travellers in search of the picturesque still lament that the ugly\nstranger has ousted the trellised vine and the wild, free myrtles. But\npublic opinion changed when fortunes were made by selling the\ninsect. Greedy as the agriculturist in general, the people would refuse\nthe value of a full crop of potatoes or maize if they suspected that the\nofferer intended to grow cochineal. No dye was prepared on the islands,\nand the peasants looked upon it as a manner of mystery.",
        "The best tuneras (cochineal-plantations) lay in Grand Canary,\nwhere they could be most watered. Wherever maize thrives, producing a\ngood dark leaf and grain in plenty, there cochineal also succeeds. The\nsoil is technically called mina de tosca, a whitish, pumice-like\nstone, often forming a gravel conglomerate under a rocky stratum:\nhardening by exposure, it is good for building. Immense labour is\nrequired to prepare such ground for the cactus. The earth must be taken\nfrom below the surface-rock, as at Malta; spread in terraced beds, and\ncleared of loose stones, which are built up in walls or in\nmolleras, cubes or pyramids. Such ground sold for $150 per acre;\n$600 were paid for mètre-deep soil unencumbered by stone. Where the\nchalk predominates, it must be mixed with the volcanic sand locally\ncalled zahorra. In all cases the nopals are set at distances of\nhalf a yard, in trenches at least three feet deep. The ’streets,’ or\nintervals, must measure nearly two yards, so that water may flow freely\nand sunshine may not be arrested. Good ground, if irrigated in winter\nand kept clear of weeds by the haçada (hoe), produces a cactus\ncapable of being ’seeded’ after the second year; if poor, a third is\nrequired. The plant lasts, with manure to defend it from exhaustion, a\nfull decade. [Footnote: The compost was formerly natural, dry or liquid\nas in Switzerland; but for some years the costly guano and chemicals\nhave been introduced. Formerly also potatoes were set between the stems;\nand well-watered lands gave an annual grain-crop as well as a green\ncrop.]",
        "I now translate the memoir sent in MS. to me by my kind friend\nDundas. It is the work of Don Abel de Aguilar, Consul Impérial de\nRussie, a considerable producer of the ’bug.’",
        "The semillado, or cochineal-sowing, is divided into three\ncosechas (crops), according to the several localities in the\nislands.",
        "The abuelas (grandmothers) are those planted in\nOctober-November. Their seed gives a new growth set in February-March,\nand called madres (mothers). Thirdly, those planted in June-July,\ngathered in September-October, and serving to begin with the\nabuelas, are called la cosecha (the crop). The first and\nsecond may be planted on the seaboard; the last is confined to the\nmidlands and uplands, on account of the heat and the hot winds,\nespecially the souther and the south-south-easter, which asphyxiate the\ninsect.",
        "And now of the abuelas, as cultivated in the maritime regions\nof Santa Cruz, Tenerife.",
        "Every cochineal-plantation must have a house with windows facing the\nsouth, and freely admitting the light–an indispensable condition. The\ncuarto del semillado (breeding-room) should be heated by stoves\nto a regular temperature of 30°-32° (R.). At this season the proportion\nof seed is calculated at 30 boxes of 40 lbs. each, or a total of 1,200\nlbs. per fanega, the latter being equivalent to a half-hectare.\nThe cochineal is placed in large wooden trays lined with\ncloth, and containing about 15 lbs. of the recently gathered seed. When\nfilled without crowding, the trays are covered with squares of\ncotton-cloth (raw muslin), measuring 12-16 inches. Usually the\nfanega requires 20-30 quintals (128 lbs., or a cwt.), each\ncosting $15 to $17. The newly born insects (hijuelos) adhere to\nthe cochineal-rags, and these are carried to the tunera, in\ncovered baskets.",
        "The operation is repeated with fresh rags till the parturition is\ncompleted. The last born, after 12-15 days, are the weakest. They are\nknown by their dark colour, the earlier seed being grey-white, like\ncigar-ashes. The cochineal which has produced all its insects is known\nin the markets as ’zacatillas.’ It commanded higher prices, because the\nwatery parts had disappeared and only the colouring matter remained. Now\nits value is that of the white or cosecha.",
        "The cochineal-rags are then carried by women and girls to the\ntunera, and are attached to the cactus-leaves by passing the\ncloths round them and by pinning them on with the thorns. This\noperation, requires great care, judgment, and experience. The good\nresults of the crop depend upon the judicious distribution of the\n’bugs;’ and error is easy when making allowance for their loss by wind,\nrain, or change of temperature. The insects walk over the whole leaf,\nand choose their places sheltered as much as possible, although still\ncovered by the rags. After 8-10 days they insert the proboscis into the\ncactus, and never stir till gathered. At the end of three and a half to\nfour months they become ’grains of cochineal,’ not unlike wheat, but\nsmaller, rounder, and thicker. The sign of maturity is the appearance of\nnew insects upon the leaf. The rags are taken off, as they were put on,\nby women and girls, and the cochineal is swept into baskets with brushes\nof palm-frond. As the abuelas grow in winter there is great loss\nof life. For each pound sown the cultivator gets only two to two and a\nhalf, innumerable insects being lost either in the house or out of\ndoors.",
        "The crop thus gathered produces the madres (mothers): the latter\nare sown in February-March, and are gathered in May-June. The only\ndifference of treatment is that the rags are removed when the weather is\nsafe and the free draught benefits the insects. The produce is\ngreater–three and a half to four pounds for one.",
        "The cosecha of the madres produces most abundantly, on\naccount of the settled weather. The cochineal breeds better in the\nhouse, where there is more light and a higher temperature. The result is\nthat 8 to 10 lbs. become 100. It is cheaper too: as a lesser proportion\nof rag is wanted for the field, and it is kept on only till the insect\nadheres. Thus a small quantity goes a long way. At this season there is\nno need of the cuarto, and bags of pierced paper or of\nrengue (loose gauze), measuring 10 inches long by 2 broad, are\npreferred. A spoonful of grain, about 4 ounces, is put into each bag and\nis hung to the leaves: the young ones crawl through the holes or meshes\ntill the plant is sufficiently populated. In hot weather they may be\nchanged eight times a day with great economy of labour. This is the most\nfavourable form; the insects go straight to the leaves, and it is easy\nto estimate the proportions.",
        "So far Don Abel. He concludes with saying that cochineal, which in other\ndays made the fortune of his native islands, will soon be completely\nabandoned. Let us hope not.",
        "The cosecha-insects, shell-like in form, grey-coloured, of light\nweight, but all colouring matter, are either sold for breeding\nabuelas or are placed upon trays and killed in stoves by a heat\nof 150°-160° (Fahr.). The drying process is managed by reducing the\ntemperature to 140°. The time varies from twenty-four to forty-eight\nhours: when hurried it injures the crop. Ninety full-grown insects weigh\nsome forty-eight grains, and there is a great reduction by drying; some\n27,000 yield one pound of the prepared cochineal. The shiny black\ncochineal, which looks like small beetles, is produced by sun-drying,\nand by shaking the insect in a linen bag or in a small ’merry-go-round,’\nso as to remove the white powder. [Footnote: Mr. H. Vizetelly (p. 210)\nsays that black metallic sand is used to give it brilliancy.] The form,\nhowever, must be preserved. It sells 6d. per lb. higher than the\ncochinilla de plata, or silver cochineal. Lastly, the dried crop\nis packed in bags, covered with mats, and is then ready for exportation.",
        "The traffic began about 1835 with an export of only 1,275 lbs.; and\nbetween 1850 and 1860 the lb. was worth at least ten francs. Admiral\nRobinson [Footnote: Sea-drift, a volume published by subscription.\nPitman, London, 1852.] in 1852 makes the export one million of\nlbs. at one dollar each, or a total of 250,000l. During the\nrage of the oïdium the cultivation was profitable and raised\nthe Canaries high in the scale of material prosperity. In 1862\nthe islands exported 10,000 quintals, or hundred-weights, the\ntotal value being still one million of dollars. In 1877-78\nthe produce was contained in 20,000 to 25,000 bags, each\naveraging 175 lbs., at a value of half a crown per lb.: it was then\nstated that, owing to the increased expense of irrigation and of guano\nor chemical manures, nothing under two shillings would repay the\ncultivator. In 1878-79 the total export amounted to 5,045,007 lbs. In\n1879-80 this figure had fallen off to 4,036,871 lbs., a decrease of\n5,482 bags, or 1,008,136 lbs.; moreover the prices, which had been\nforced up by speculation, declined from 2s. 6d.-3s. 4d.\nto 1s. 8d. and 1s. 10d. [Footnote: These figures are taken\nfrom the able Consular Report of Mr. Consul Dundas, printed in Part\nviii., 1881.] When I last visited Las Palmas (April 1880), cochineal,\nunder the influence of magenta and mineral dyes, was selling at\n1s. 4d. instead of one to two dollars.",
        "It is to be feared that the palmy days of cochineal are over, and that\nits chief office, besides staining liqueurs and tooth-powders, will be\nto keep down the price of the chemicals. With regret I see this handsome\nand harmless colour being gradually superseded by the economical\nanilines, whose poisonous properties have not yet been fully recognised\nby the public. The change is a pregnant commentary upon the good and\nhomely old English saying, ’Cheap and nasty.’",
        "The fall of cochineal throughout the Canaries brought many successors\ninto the field, but none can boast of great success. Silk, woven and\nspun, was tried; unfortunately, the worms were fed on tartago (a\nricinus), instead of the plentiful red and white mulberries. The\nharvest was abundant, but not admired by manufacturers. In fact, the\nmoderns have failed where their predecessors treated the stuff so well\nthat Levantines imported silks to resell them in Italy. Formerly\nTenerife contained a manufactory whose lasting and brilliant produce was\nhighly appreciated in Spain as in Havana. At Palma crimson waist-sashes\nused to sell for an ounce of gold.",
        "Tobacco-growing was patronised by Government in 1878, probably with the\nview of mixing it in their monopoly-manufactories with the growths of\nCuba and Manilla. But on this favour being withdrawn the next year’s\nharvest fell to one-fourth (354,640 lbs. to 36,978). The best sites were\nin Hierro (Ferro) and Adejo, in the south of Tenerife. The chief\nobstacles to success are imperfect cultivation, the expense of skilled\nlabour, and deficiency of water to irrigate the deep black soil. Both\nVirginia and Havana leaves were grown, and good brands sold from eight\nto sixteen dollars per 100 lbs. The customers in order of quantity are\nGermany, England, France, South America, and the West Coast of Africa,\nwhere the cigars are now common. One brand (Republicanos) is so good\nthat I should not wish to smoke better. At home they sell for twelve\ndollars per 1,000; a price which rises, I am told, in England to one\nshilling each. They are to be procured through Messieurs Davidson, of\nSanta Cruz.",
        "The Canarians now talk of sugar-growing; but the cane will inevitably\nfare worse for want of water than either silk or tobacco.",
        "Next to cochineal in the Canary Islands, especially in Tenerife, ranks\nthe gallo, or fighting-cock. Cockfighting’ amongst ourselves is\nredolent of foul tobacco, bad beer, and ruffianism in low places. This\nis not the case in Spain and her colonies, where the classical sport of\nGreece and Rome still holds its ground. I have pleasant reminiscences of\nthe good Padre in the Argentine Republic who after mass repaired\nregularly to the pit, wearing his huge canoe-like hat and carrying under\nhis arm a well-bred bird instead of a breviary. Here too I was told that\nthe famous Derby breed of the twelfth Earl had extended in past times\nthroughout the length and breadth of the land; and the next visit to\nKnowsley convinced me that the legend was based on fact. As regards\ncruelty, all popular sports, fox-hunting and pigeon-shooting, are\ncruel. Grallus, however, has gained since the days of Cock-Mondays and\nCock-Fridays, when he was staked down to be killed by ’cock-sticks’ or\nwas whipped to his death by blindfolded carters. He leads the life of a\nfriar; he is tended carefully as any babe; he is permitted to indulge\nhis pugnacity, which it would be harsh to restrain, and at worst he dies\nfighting like a gentleman. A Tenerifan would shudder at the horror of\nour fashionable sport, where ruffians gouge or blind the pigeon with a\npin, squeeze it to torture, wrench out its tail, and thrust the upper\nthrough the lower mandible.",
        "The bird in Tenerife surpasses those of the other Canary Islands, and\nmore than once has carried off the prizes at Seville. A moderately\nwell-bred specimen may be bought for two dollars, but first-rate cocks\nbelonging to private fanciers have no price.",
        "Many proprietors, as at Hyderabad, in the Dakhan, will not part with\neven the eggs. The shape of the Canarian bird is rather that of a\npheasant than a ’rooster.’ The coat varies; it is black and red with\nyellow shanks, black and yellow, white and gold, and a grey, hen-like\ncolour, our ’duck-wing,’ locally called gallinho. Here, as in\nmany other places, the ’white feather’ is no sign of bad blood. The\ntoilet is peculiar. Comb and wattles are ’dubbed’ (clean shaven), and\nthe circumvental region is depilated or clipped with scissors, leaving\nonly the long tail-feathers springing from a naked surface. The skin is\ndaily rubbed, after negro fashion, with lemon-juice, inducing a fiery\nred hue: this is done for cleanliness, and is supposed also to harden\nthe cuticle. Altogether the appearance is coquet, sportsmanlike, and\ndecidedly appropriate.",
        "The game-chicks are sent to the country, like town-born babes in France\nor the sons of Arabian cities to the Bedawin’s black tents. The cockerel\nbegins fighting in his second, and is not a ’stale bird’ till his fifth\nor sixth, year. In early spring aspirants to the honours of the arena\nare brought to the towns for education and for training, which lasts\nsome six weeks. I was invited to visit a walk belonging to a wealthy\nproprietor at Orotava, who obligingly answered all my questions. Some\nfifty birds occupied the largest room of a deserted barrack, which\nproclaimed its later use at the distance of half a mile. The gladiators\nwere disposed in four long, parallel rows of cages, open cane-work,\nmeasuring three feet square. Each had a short wooden trestle placed\noutside during the day and serving by night as a perch. They were fed\nand watered at 2 P.M. The fattening maize was first given, and then\nwheat, with an occasional cram of bread-crumb and water by way of\nphysic. The masálá and multifarious spices of the Hindostani\ntrainer are here ignored.",
        "The birds are not allowed, as in India, to become so fierce that they\nattack men: this is supposed to render them too hot and headstrong in\ncombat. Every third day there is a Pecha, or spurring-match,\nwhich proves the likeliest lot. The pit for exercise is a matted circle\nabout 6 feet in diameter. A well-hodded bird is placed in it, and the\nassistant holds up a second, waving it to and fro and provoking No. 1 to\ntake his exercise by springing to the attack. The Indian style of\ngalloping the cock by showing a hen at either end of the walk is looked\nupon with disfavour, because the sight of the sex is supposed to cause\ndisease during high condition. The elaborate Eastern shampooing for\nhours has apparently never been heard of. After ten minutes’ hard\nrunning and springing the bird is sponged with Jamaica rum and water, to\nprevent chafing; the lotion is applied to the head and hind quarters, to\nthe tender and dangerous parts under the wings, and especially to the\nleg-joints. The lower mandible is then held firmly between the left\nthumb and forefinger, and a few drops are poured into the beak. Every\nalternate day the cage is placed on loose ground in sun and wind; and\nonce a week there is a longer sparring-bout with thick leather hods, or\nspur-pads.",
        "Cock-fighting takes place once a year, when the birds are in fittest\nfeather; it begins on Easter Sunday and ends with the following\nWednesday.",
        "  The bird that warned Peter of his fall",
        "has then, if victorious, a pleasant, easy twelve months of life before\nhim. He has won many a gold ounce for his owner: I have heard of a man\npouching 400l. in a contest between Orotava and La Laguna, which\nhas a well-merited celebrity for these exhibitions. The Canarians ignore\nall such refinements as rounds or Welsh mains; the birds are fairly\nmatched in pairs. Navajas, or spurs, either of silver or steel,\nare unused, if not unknown. The natural weapon is sharpened to a\nneedle-like point, and then blood and condition win. The cock-pit,\nsomewhat larger than the training-pit, is in the Casa de la Galera;\nthere is a ring for betters, and the spectators are ranged on upper\nseats.",
        "Lastly of the wine Canary, now unknown to the English market, where it\nhad a local habitation and a name as early as madeira and sherry, all\nclaiming ’Shakespearean recognition.’ The Elizabethans constantly allude\nto cups of cool Canary, and Mr. Vizetelly quotes Howell’s ’Familiar\nLetters,’ wherein he applies to this far-famed sack the dictum ’Good\nwine sendeth a man to heaven.’ But I cannot agree with the learned\noenologist, or with the ’tradition of Tenerife,’ when told that ’the\noriginal canary was a sweet and not a dry wine, as those who derive\n“sack” from the French word “sec” would have us believe.’ ’Sherris sack’\n(jerez seco) was a harsh, dry wine, which was sugared as we\nsweeten tea. Hence Poins addresses Falstaff as ’Sir John Sack and\nSugar;’ and the latter remarks, ’If sack and sugar be a fault, God help\nthe wicked!’ And the island probably had two growths–the saccharine\nMalvasia, [Footnote: As we find in Leake (p. 197 Researches in\nGreece) and Henderson (History of Wines) ’Malvasia’ is an\nItalian corruption of ’Monemvasia’ ([Greek: monae embasia]–a\nsingle entrance), the neo-Greek name for the Minoa promontory or island\nconnected by a bridge with the Laconian Coast. Hence the French\nMalvoisie and our Malmsey. Prof. Azevedo (loc. cit.) opines that\nthe date of the wine’s introduction disproves the legend of that\n’maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.’] whose black grape was almost a\nraisin, and a harsh produce like that of the modern Gual, with\ngreat volume and alcoholic strength, but requiring time to make it\npalatable.",
        "The Canaries mostly grew white wines; that is, the liquors were\nfermented without skins and stalks. Thus they did not contain all the\nconstituents of the fruit, and they were inferior in remedial and\nrestorative virtues to red wines. Indeed, a modern authority tells us\nthat none but the latter deserve the name, and that white wines are\nrather grape-ciders than real wines.",
        "The best Tenerife brands were produced on the northern slopes from\nSauzal and La Victoria to Garachico and Ycod de los Vinos. The latter,\nfamed for its malmsey, has lost its vines and kept its name. The\ncultivation extended some 1,500 feet above the sea, and the plant was\ntreated after the fashion of Madeira and Carniola (S. Austria). The\nlatadas, or trellises, varied in height, some being so low that\nthe peasant had to creep under them. All, however, had the same defect:\nthe fruit got the shade and the leaves the sun, unless trimmed away by\nthe cultivator, who was unwilling to remove these lungs in too great\nquantities. The French style, the pruned plant supported by a stake, was\nused only for the old and worn-out, and none dreamt of the galvanised\nwires along which Mr. Leacock, of Funchal, trains his vines. In Grand\nCanary I have seen the grape-plant thrown over swathes of black stone,\nlike those which, bare of fruit, stretch for miles across the fertile\nwastes of the Syrian Haurán. By heat and evaporation the grapes become\nraisins; and, as in Dalmatia, one pipe required as much fruit as\nsufficed for three or four of ordinary.",
        "The favourite of the Canaries is, or was, the vidonia, a juicy\nberry, mostly white, seldom black: the same is the case with the\nmuscadels. The Malvasia is rarely cultivated, as it suffered\ninordinately from the vine-disease. The valuable Verdelho,\npreferred at Madeira, is, or was, a favourite; and there are, or were,\nhalf a dozen others. The vendange usually began in the lowlands\nabout the end of August, and in the uplands a fortnight or three weeks\nlater. The grape was carried in large baskets by men, women, and\nchildren, to the lagar, or wooden press, and was there trodden\ndown, as in Madeira, Austria, and Italy. The Canarians, like other\nneo-Latins an unmechanical race, care little for economising labour. The\nvinification resembled that of the Isle of Wood, with one important\nexception–the stove. This artificial heating to hasten maturity seems\nto have been soon abandoned.",
        "Mr. Vizetelly is of opinion that the pure juice was apt to grow harsh,\nor become ropy, with age. They remedied the former defect by adding a\nlittle gloria, a thin, sweet wine kept in store from the\npreceding vendange; this was done in April or in May, when the\nvintage was received at headquarters. Ropiness was cured by repeated\nrackings and by brandying, eight gallons per pipe being the normal\nratio. That distinguished connoisseur found in an old malmsey of 1859\nall the aroma and lusciousness of a good liqueur; the ’London\nparticular’ of 1865 tasted remarkably soft, with a superior nose; an\n1871-72, made for the Russian market, had an oily richness with a\nconsiderable aroma; an 1872 was mellow and aromatic, and an 1875 had a\ngood vinous flavour.",
        "’Canary’ possessed its own especial charác-ter, as Jonathan says. If it\ndeveloped none of the highest qualities of its successful rivals, it\nbecame, after eight to twelve years’ keeping, a tolerable wine, which\nmany in England have drunk, paying for good madeira. The shorter period\nsufficed to mature it, and it was usually shipped when three to four\nyears old. It kept to advantage in wood for a quarter of a century, and\nin bottle it improved faster. My belief is that the properest use of\nTenerife was to ’lengthen out’ the finer growths. I found Canary bearing\nthe same relation to madeira as marsala bears to sherry: the best\nspecimens almost equalled the second or third-rate madeiras. Moreover,\nthese wines are even more heady and spirituous than those of the\nnorthern island; and there will be greater difficulty in converting them\nto the category vino de pasto, a light dinner-wine.",
        "Before 1810 Tenerife exported her wines not from Santa Cruz, but from\nOrotava, the centre of commerce. Here, since the days of Charles II.,\nthere was an English Factory with thirty to forty British subjects,\nProtestants, under the protection of the Captain-General; and their\ncemetery lay at the west end of El Puerto, whose palmy days were in\n1812-15. The trade was then transferred to the modern capital, where\nthere are, and have been for years, only two English wine-shipping\nfirms, Messieurs Hamilton and Messieurs Davidson. The seniors of both\nfamilies have all passed away; but their sons and grandsons still\ninhabit the picturesque old houses on the ’Marina.’  In 1812-15 the\nannual export of wine was 8,000 to 11,000 pipes. The Peace of 1815 was a\nsevere blow to the trade. Between 1830 and 1840, however, the vintage of\nthe seven chief islands averaged upwards of 46,000; of these Tenerife\nsupplied between 4,000 and 5,000, equivalent to the total produce since\nthe days of the oïdium. In 1852 Admiral Robinson reduced the number of\npipes to 20,000, worth 200,000l. In 1860-65 I saw the grape in a\npiteous plight: the huge bunches were composed of dwarfed and wilted\nberries, furred and cobwebbed with the foul mycelium. The produce fell\nto 100-150 pipes, and at present only some 200 to 300 are exported. The\nPeninsula and the West African coast take the bulk; England and Germany\nranking next, and lastly Spain, which used the import largely in\nmaking-up wines. The islanders now mostly drink the harsh, coarse\nCatalonians; they still, however, make for home consumption a cheap\nwhite wine, which improves with age. It is regretable that fears of the\noïdium and the phylloxera prevent the revival of the industry, for which\nthe Islands are admirably fitted. Potatoes and other produce have also\nsuffered; but that is no obstacle to their being replanted.",
        "I left Santa Cruz and Las Palmas, after two short visits, with the\nconviction that both are on the highway of progress, and much edified by\ntheir contrast with Funchal. The difference is that of a free port and a\nclosed port. In the former there is commercial, industrial, and literary\nactivity: Las Palmas can support two museums. In the latter there is\nneither this, that, nor the other. Madeira also suffers from repressed\nemigration. The Canaries wisely allow their sons to make gold ounces\nabroad for spending at home.",
        "Spain also, a few years ago so backward in the race, is fast regaining\nher place amongst the nations. She is now reaping the benefit of her\ntruly liberal (not Liberal) policy. Such were the abolition of the\nmorgado (primogeniture) in 1834, the closing of the 1,800\nconvents in 1836-37, and the disamortizacion, or suppression of\nChurch property and granting liberty of belief, in 1855. Finally, the\nvigour infused by a short–which will lead to a longer–trial of\ndemocracy and of republican institutions have given her a new life. She\nis no longer the Gallio of the Western world.",
