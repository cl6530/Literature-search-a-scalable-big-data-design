        "Sweden to-day is one of the peaceful kingdoms of the world, whose\npeople are prosperous, well governed, and somewhat apart from the\nclash and turmoil of other states and nations. Even the secession\nof Norway, a few years ago, was accomplished without bloodshed,\nand now the two kingdoms exist side by side as free from strife as\nthey are with Denmark, which once domineered and tyrannized over\nboth.",
        "It is difficult to believe that long ago, in the Middle Ages, the\ncities of southern Sweden were among the great commercial centers\nof the world. Stockholm and Lund ranked with London and Paris.\nThey absorbed the commerce of the northern seas, and were the\nadmiration of thousands of travelers and merchants who passed\nthrough them and trafficked with them.",
        "Much nearer to our own time, Sweden was the great military power\nof northern Europe. The ambassadors of the Swedish kings were\nreceived with the utmost deference in every court. Her soldiers\nwon great battles and ended mighty wars. The England of Cromwell\nand Charles II. was unimportant and isolated in comparison with\nthis northern kingdom, which could pour forth armies of gigantic\nblond warriors, headed by generals astute as well as brave.",
        "It was no small matter, then, in 1626, that the loyal Swedes were\nhoping that their queen would give birth to a male heir to succeed\nhis splendid father, Gustavus Adolphus, ranked by military\nhistorians as one of the six great generals whom the world had so\nfar produced. The queen, a German princess of Brandenburg, had\nalready borne two daughters, who died in infancy. The expectation\nwas wide-spread and intense that she should now become the mother\nof a son; and the king himself was no less anxious.",
        "When the event occurred, the child was seen to be completely\ncovered with hair, and for this reason the attendants at first\nbelieved that it was the desired boy. When their mistake was\ndiscovered they were afraid to tell the king, who was waiting in\nhis study for the announcement to be made. At last, when no one\nelse would go to him, his sister, the Princess Caroline,\nvolunteered to break the news.",
        "Gustavus was in truth a chivalrous, high-bred monarch. Though he\nmust have been disappointed at the advent of a daughter, he showed\nno sign of dissatisfaction or even of surprise; but, rising, he\nembraced his sister, saying:",
        "“Let us thank God. I hope this girl will be as good as a boy to\nme. May God preserve her now that He has sent her!”",
        "It is customary at almost all courts to pay less attention to the\nbirth of a princess than to that of a prince; but Gustavus\ndisplayed his chivalry toward this little daughter, whom he named\nChristina. He ordered that the full royal salute should be fired\nin every fortress of his kingdom and that displays of fireworks,\nballs of honor, and court functions should take place; “for,” as\nhe said, “this is the heir to my throne.” And so from the first he\ntook his child under his own keeping and treated her as if she\nwere a much-loved son as well as a successor.",
        "He joked about her looks when she was born, when she was mistaken\nfor a boy.",
        "“She will be clever,” he said, “for she has taken us all in!”",
        "The Swedish people were as delighted with their little princess as\nwere the people of Holland when the present Queen Wilhelmina was\nborn, to carry on the succession of the House of Orange. On one\noccasion the king and the small Christina, who were inseparable\ncompanions, happened to approach a fortress where they expected to\nspend the night. The commander of the castle was bound to fire a\nroyal salute of fifty cannon in honor of his sovereign; yet he\ndreaded the effect upon the princess of such a roaring and\nbellowing of artillery. He therefore sent a swift horseman to meet\nthe royal party at a distance and explain his perplexity. Should\nhe fire these guns or not? Would the king give an order?",
        "Gustavus thought for a moment, and then replied:",
        "“My daughter is the daughter of a soldier, and she must learn to\nlead a soldier’s life. Let the guns be fired!”",
        "The procession moved on. Presently fire spurted from the\nembrasures of the fort, and its batteries thundered in one great\nroar. The king looked down at Christina. Her face was aglow with\npleasure and excitement; she clapped her hands and laughed, and\ncried out:",
        "“More bang! More! More! More!”",
        "This is only one of a score of stories that were circulated about\nthe princess, and the Swedes were more and more delighted with the\ngirl who was to be their queen.",
        "Somewhat curiously, Christina’s mother, Queen Maria, cared little\nfor the child, and, in fact, came at last to detest her almost as\nmuch as the king loved her. It is hard to explain this dislike.\nPerhaps she had a morbid desire for a son and begrudged the honors\ngiven to a daughter. Perhaps she was a little jealous of her own\nchild, who took so much of the king’s attention. Afterward, in\nwriting of her mother, Christina excuses her, and says quite\nfrankly:",
        "She could not bear to see me, because I was a girl, and an ugly\ngirl at that. And she was right enough, for I was as tawny as a\nlittle Turk.",
        "This candid description of herself is hardly just. Christina was\nnever beautiful, and she had a harsh voice. She was apt to be\noverbearing even as a little girl. Yet she was a most interesting\nchild, with an expressive face, large eyes, an aquiline nose, and\nthe blond hair of her people. There was nothing in this to account\nfor her mother’s intense dislike for her.",
        "It was currently reported at the time that attempts were made to\nmaim or seriously injure the little princess. By what was made to\nseem an accident, she would be dropped upon the floor, and heavy\narticles of furniture would somehow manage to strike her. More\nthan once a great beam fell mysteriously close to her, either in\nthe palace or while she was passing through the streets. None of\nthese things did her serious harm, however. Most of them she\nluckily escaped; but when she had grown to be a woman one of her\nshoulders was permanently higher than the other.",
        "“I suppose,” said Christina, “that I could be straightened if I\nwould let the surgeons attend to it; but it isn’t worth while to\ntake the trouble.”",
        "When Christina was four, Sweden became involved in the great war\nthat had been raging for a dozen years between the Protestant and\nthe Catholic states of Germany. Gradually the neighboring powers\nhad been drawn into the struggle, either to serve their own ends\nor to support the faith to which they adhered. Gustavus Adolphus\ntook up the sword with mixed motives, for he was full of\nenthusiasm for the imperiled cause of the Reformation, and at the\nsame time he deemed it a favorable opportunity to assert his\ncontrol over the shores of the Baltic.",
        "The warrior king summoned his army and prepared to invade Germany.\nBefore departing he took his little daughter by the hand and led\nher among the assembled nobles and councilors of state. To them he\nintrusted the princess, making them kneel and vow that they would\nregard her as his heir, and, if aught should happen to him, as his\nsuccessor. Amid the clashing of swords and the clang of armor this\nvow was taken, and the king went forth to war.",
        "He met the ablest generals of his enemies, and the fortunes of\nbattle swayed hither and thither; but the climax came when his\nsoldiers encountered those of Wallenstein–that strange,\noverbearing, arrogant, mysterious creature whom many regarded with\na sort of awe. The clash came at Lutzen, in Saxony. The Swedish\nking fought long and hard, and so did his mighty opponent; but at\nlast, in the very midst of a tremendous onset that swept all\nbefore him, Gustavus received a mortal wound and died, even while\nWallenstein was fleeing from the field of battle.",
        "The battle of Lutzen made Christina Queen of Sweden at the age of\nsix. Of course, she could not yet be crowned, but a council of\nable ministers continued the policy of the late king and taught\nthe young queen her first lessons in statecraft. Her intellect\nsoon showed itself as more than that of a child. She understood\nall that was taking place, and all that was planned and arranged.\nHer tact was unusual. Her discretion was admired by every one; and\nafter a while she had the advice and training of the great Swedish\nchancellor, Oxenstierna, whose wisdom she shared to a remarkable\ndegree.",
        "Before she was sixteen she had so approved herself to her\ncounselors, and especially to the people at large, that there was\na wide-spread clamor that she should take the throne and govern in\nher own person. To this she gave no heed, but said:",
        "“I am not yet ready.”",
        "All this time she bore herself like a king. There was nothing\ndistinctly feminine about her. She took but slight interest in her\nappearance. She wore sword and armor in the presence of her\ntroops, and often she dressed entirely in men’s clothes. She would\ntake long, lonely gallops through the forests, brooding over\nproblems of state and feeling no fatigue or fear. And indeed why\nshould she fear, who was beloved by all her subjects?",
        "When her eighteenth year arrived, the demand for her coronation\nwas impossible to resist. All Sweden wished to see a ruling queen,\nwho might marry and have children to succeed her through the royal\nline of her great father. Christina consented to be crowned, but\nshe absolutely refused all thought of marriage. She had more\nsuitors from all parts of Europe than even Elizabeth of England;\nbut, unlike Elizabeth, she did not dally with them, give them\nfalse hopes, or use them for the political advantage of her\nkingdom.",
        "At that time Sweden was stronger than England, and was so situated\nas to be independent of alliances. So Christina said, in her\nharsh, peremptory voice:",
        "“I shall never marry; and why should you speak of my having\nchildren! I am just as likely to give birth to a Nero as to an\nAugustus.”",
        "Having assumed the throne, she ruled with a strictness of\ngovernment such as Sweden had not known before. She took the reins\nof state into her own hands and carried out a foreign policy of\nher own, over the heads of her ministers, and even against the\nwishes of her people. The fighting upon the Continent had dragged\nout to a weary length, but the Swedes, on the whole, had scored a\nmarked advantage. For this reason the war was popular, and every\none wished it to go on; but Christina, of her own will, decided\nthat it must stop, that mere glory was not to be considered\nagainst material advantages. Sweden had had enough of glory; she\nmust now look to her enrichment and prosperity through the\nchannels of peace.",
        "Therefore, in 1648, against Oxenstierna, against her generals, and\nagainst her people, she exercised her royal power and brought the\nThirty Years’ War to an end by the so-called Peace of Westphalia.\nAt this time she was twenty-two, and by her personal influence she\nhad ended one of the greatest struggles of history. Nor had she\ndone it to her country’s loss. Denmark yielded up rich provinces,\nwhile Germany was compelled to grant Sweden membership in the\nGerman diet.",
        "Then came a period of immense prosperity through commerce, through\neconomies in government, through the improvement of agriculture\nand the opening of mines. This girl queen, without intrigue,\nwithout descending from her native nobility to peep and whisper\nwith shady diplomats, showed herself in reality a great monarch, a\ntrue Semiramis of the north, more worthy of respect and reverence\nthan Elizabeth of England. She was highly trained in many arts.\nShe was fond of study, spoke Latin fluently, and could argue with\nSalmasius, Descartes, and other accomplished scholars without\nshowing any inferiority to them.",
        "She gathered at her court distinguished persons from all\ncountries. She repelled those who sought her hand, and she was\npure and truthful and worthy of all men’s admiration. Had she died\nat this time history would rank her with the greatest of women\nsovereigns. Naude, the librarian of Cardinal Mazarin, wrote of her\nto the scientist Gassendi in these words:",
        "To say truth, I am sometimes afraid lest the common saying should\nbe verified in her, that short is the life and rare the old age of\nthose who surpass the common limits. Do not imagine that she is\nlearned only in books, for she is equally so in painting,\narchitecture, sculpture, medals, antiquities, and all curiosities.\nThere is not a cunning workman in these arts but she has him\nfetched. There are as good workers in wax and in enamel,\nengravers, singers, players, dancers here as will be found\nanywhere.",
        "She has a gallery of statues, bronze and marble, medals of gold,\nsilver, and bronze, pieces of ivory, amber, coral, worked crystal,\nsteel mirrors, clocks and tables, bas-reliefs and other things of\nthe kind; richer I have never seen even in Italy; finally, a great\nquantity of pictures. In short, her mind is open to all\nimpressions.",
        "But after she began to make her court a sort of home for art and\nletters it ceased to be the sort of court that Sweden was prepared\nfor. Christina’s subjects were still rude and lacking in\naccomplishments; therefore she had to summon men of genius from\nother countries, especially from France and Italy. Many of these\nwere illustrious artists or scholars, but among them were also\nsome who used their mental gifts for harm.",
        "Among these latter was a French physician named Bourdelot–a man\nof keen intellect, of winning manners, and of a profound cynicism,\nwhich was not apparent on the surface, but the effect of which\nlast lasting. To Bourdelot we must chiefly ascribe the mysterious\nchange which gradually came over Queen Christina. With his\nassociates he taught her a distaste for the simple and healthy\nlife that she had been accustomed to lead. She ceased to think of\nthe welfare of the state and began to look down with scorn upon\nher unsophisticated Swedes. Foreign luxury displayed itself at\nStockholm, and her palaces overflowed with beautiful things.",
        "By subtle means Bourdelot undermined her principles. Having been a\nStoic, she now became an Epicurean. She was by nature devoid of\nsentiment. She would not spend her time in the niceties of love-\nmaking, as did Elizabeth; but beneath the surface she had a sort\nof tigerish, passionate nature, which would break forth at\nintervals, and which demanded satisfaction from a series of\nfavorites. It is probable that Bourdelot was her first lover, but\nthere were many others whose names are recorded in the annals of\nthe time.",
        "When she threw aside her virtue Christina ceased to care about\nappearances. She squandered her revenues upon her favorites. What\nshe retained of her former self was a carelessness that braved the\nopinion of her subjects. She dressed almost without thought, and\nit is said that she combed her hair not more than twice a month.\nShe caroused with male companions to the scandal of her people,\nand she swore like a trooper when displeased.",
        "Christina’s philosophy of life appears to have been compounded of\nan almost brutal licentiousness, a strong love of power, and a\nstrange, freakish longing for something new. Her political\nambitions were checked by the rising discontent of her people, who\nbegan to look down upon her and to feel ashamed of her shame.\nKnowing herself as she did, she did not care to marry.",
        "Yet Sweden must have an heir. Therefore she chose out her cousin\nCharles, declared that he was to be her successor, and finally\ncaused him to be proclaimed as such before the assembled estates\nof the realm. She even had him crowned; and finally, in her\ntwenty-eighth year, she abdicated altogether and prepared to leave\nSweden. When asked whither she would go, she replied in a Latin\nquotation:",
        "“The Fates will show the way.”",
        "In her act of abdication she reserved to herself the revenues of\nsome of the richest provinces in Sweden and absolute power over\nsuch of her subjects as should accompany her. They were to be her\nsubjects until the end.",
        "The Swedes remembered that Christina was the daughter of their\ngreatest king, and that, apart from personal scandals, she had\nruled them well; and so they let her go regretfully and accepted\nher cousin as their king. Christina, on her side, went joyfully\nand in the spirit of a grand adventuress. With a numerous suite\nshe entered Germany, and then stayed for a year at Brussels, where\nshe renounced Lutheranism. After this she traveled slowly into\nItaly, where she entered Borne on horseback, and was received by\nthe Pope, Alexander VII., who lodged her in a magnificent palace,\naccepted her conversion, and baptized her, giving her a new name,\nAlexandra.",
        "In Rome she was a brilliant but erratic personage, living\nsumptuously, even though her revenues from Sweden came in slowly,\npartly because the Swedes disliked her change of religion. She was\nsurrounded by men of letters, with whom she amused herself, and\nshe took to herself a lover, the Marquis Monaldeschi. She thought\nthat at last she had really found her true affinity, while\nMonaldeschi believed that he could count on the queen’s fidelity.",
        "He was in attendance upon her daily, and they were almost\ninseparable. He swore allegiance to her and thereby made himself\none of the subjects over whom she had absolute power. For a time\nhe was the master of those intense emotions which, in her,\nalternated with moods of coldness and even cruelty.",
        "Monaldeschi was a handsome Italian, who bore himself with a fine\nair of breeding. He understood the art of charming, but he did not\nknow that beyond a certain time no one could hold the affections\nof Christina.",
        "However, after she had quarreled with various cardinals and\ndecided to leave Rome for a while, Monaldeschi accompanied her to\nFrance, where she had an immense vogue at the court of Louis XIV.\nShe attracted wide attention because of her eccentricity and utter\nlack of manners. It gave her the greatest delight to criticize the\nladies of the French court–their looks, their gowns, and their\njewels. They, in return, would speak of Christina’s deformed\nshoulder and skinny frame; but the king was very gracious to her\nand invited her to his hunting-palace at Fontainebleau.",
        "While she had been winning triumphs of sarcasm the infatuated\nMonaldeschi had gradually come to suspect, and then to know, that\nhis royal mistress was no longer true to him. He had been\nsupplanted in her favor by another Italian, one Sentanelli, who\nwas the captain of her guard.",
        "Monaldeschi took a tortuous and roundabout revenge. He did not let\nthe queen know of his discovery; nor did he, like a man, send a\nchallenge to Sentanelli. Instead he began by betraying her secrets\nto Oliver Cromwell, with whom she had tried to establish a\ncorrespondence. Again, imitating the hand and seal of Sentanelli,\nhe set in circulation a series of the most scandalous and\ninsulting letters about Christina. By this treacherous trick he\nhoped to end the relations between his rival and the queen; but\nwhen the letters were carried to Christina she instantly\nrecognized their true source. She saw that she was betrayed by her\nformer favorite and that he had taken a revenge which might\nseriously compromise her.",
        "This led to a tragedy, of which the facts were long obscure. They\nwere carefully recorded, however, by the queen’s household\nchaplain, Father Le Bel; and there is also a narrative written by\none Marco Antonio Conti, which confirms the story. Both were\npublished privately in 1865, with notes by Louis Lacour.",
        "The narration of the priest is dreadful in its simplicity and\nminuteness of detail. It may be summed up briefly here, because it\nis the testimony of an eye-witness who knew Christina.",
        "Christina, with the marquis and a large retinue, was at\nFontainebleau in November, 1657. A little after midnight, when all\nwas still, the priest, Father Le Bel, was aroused and ordered to\ngo at once to the Galerie des Cerfs, or Hall of Stags, in another\npart of the palace. When he asked why, he was told:",
        "“It is by the order of her majesty the Swedish queen.”",
        "The priest, wondering, hurried on his garments. On reaching the\ngloomy hall he saw the Marquis Monaldeschi, evidently in great\nagitation, and at the end of the corridor the queen in somber\nrobes. Beside the queen, as if awaiting orders, stood three\nfigures, who could with some difficulty be made out as three\nsoldiers of her guard.",
        "The queen motioned to Father Le Bel and asked him for a packet\nwhich she had given him for safe-keeping some little time before.\nHe gave it to her, and she opened it. In it were letters and other\ndocuments, which, with a steely glance, she displayed to\nMonaldeschi. He was confused by the sight of them and by the\nincisive words in which Christina showed how he had both insulted\nher and had tried to shift the blame upon Sentanelli.",
        "Monaldeschi broke down completely. He fell at the queen’s feet and\nwept piteously, begging for pardon, only to be met by the cold\nanswer:",
        "“You are my subject and a traitor to me. Marquis, you must prepare\nto die!”",
        "Then she turned away and left the hall, in spite of the cries of\nMonaldeschi, to whom she merely added the advice that he should\nmake his peace with God by confessing to Father Le Bel.",
        "After she had gone the marquis fell into a torrent of self-\nexculpation and cried for mercy. The three armed men drew near and\nurged him to confess for the good of his soul. They seemed to have\nno malice against him, but to feel that they must obey the orders\ngiven them. At the frantic urging of the marquis their leader even\nwent to the queen to ask whether she would relent; but he returned\nshaking his head, and said:",
        "“Marquis, you must die.”",
        "Father Le Bel undertook a like mission, but returned with the\nmessage that there was no hope. So the marquis made his confession\nin French and Latin, but even then he hoped; for he did not wait\nto receive absolution, but begged still further for delay or\npardon.",
        "Then the three armed men approached, having drawn their swords.\nThe absolution was pronounced; and, following it, one of the\nguards slashed the marquis across the forehead. He stumbled and\nfell forward, making signs as if to ask that he might have his\nthroat cut. But his throat was partly protected by a coat of mail,\nso that three or four strokes delivered there had slight effect.\nFinally, however, a long, narrow sword was thrust into his side,\nafter which the marquis made no sound.",
        "Father Le Bel at once left the Galerie des Cerfs and went into the\nqueen’s apartment, with the smell of blood in his nostrils. He\nfound her calm and ready to justify herself. Was she not still\nqueen over all who had voluntarily become members of her suite?\nThis had been agreed to in her act of abdication. Wherever she set\nher foot, there, over her own, she was still a monarch, with full\npower to punish traitors at her will. This power she had\nexercised, and with justice. What mattered it that she was in\nFrance? She was queen as truly as Louis XIV. was king.",
        "The story was not long in getting out, but the truth was not\nwholly known until a much later day. It was said that Sentanelli\nhad slapped the marquis in a fit of jealousy, though some added\nthat it was done with the connivance of the queen. King Louis, the\nincarnation of absolutism, knew the truth, but he was slow to act.\nHe sympathized with the theory of Christina’s sovereignty. It was\nonly after a time that word was sent to Christina that she must\nleave Fontainebleau. She took no notice of the order until it\nsuited her convenience, and then she went forth with all the\nhonors of a reigning monarch.",
        "This was the most striking episode in all the strange story of her\nprivate life. When her cousin Charles, whom she had made king,\ndied without an heir she sought to recover her crown; but the\nestates of the realm refused her claim, reduced her income, and\nimposed restraints upon her power. She then sought the vacant\nthrone of Poland; but the Polish nobles, who desired a weak ruler\nfor their own purposes, made another choice. So at last she\nreturned to Rome, where the Pope received her with a splendid\nprocession and granted her twelve thousand crowns a year to make\nup for her lessened Swedish revenue.",
        "From this time she lived a life which she made interesting by her\npatronage of learning and exciting by her rather unseemly quarrels\nwith cardinals and even with the Pope. Her armed retinue marched\nthrough the streets with drawn swords and gave open protection to\ncriminals who had taken refuge with her. She dared to criticize\nthe pontiff, who merely smiled and said:",
        "“She is a woman!”",
        "On the whole, the end of her life was pleasant. She was much\nadmired for her sagacity in politics. Her words were listened to\nat every court in Europe. She annotated the classics, she made\nbeautiful collections, and she was regarded as a privileged person\nwhose acts no one took amiss. She died at fifty-three, and was\nburied in St. Peter’s.",
        "She was bred a man, she was almost a son to her great father; and\nyet, instead of the sonorous epitaph that is inscribed beside her\ntomb, perhaps a truer one would be the words of the vexed Pope:",
        "“E DONNA!”",
