        "Before an experienced writer takes up his pencil he has formed\ndefinitely in his mind just what he is going to write about–that\nis the simple yet startling difference between the experienced\nwriter and the novice.  Not only does the former know what his\nsubject is, but he usually knows how he is going to treat it, and\neven some striking phrases and turns of sentences are ready in his\nmind, together with the hundreds of minute points which, taken\ntogether, make up the singleness of impression of the whole.",
        "But just as it is impossible for the human mind–untrained, let\nus say, in the art of making bricks–to picture at a glance the\nvarious processes through which the clay passes before it takes\nbrick form, so it is identically as impossible for the mind of the\nnovice to comprehend in a flash the various purposes and half-purposes\nthat precede the actual work of writing anything.",
        "True as this is of writing in general, it seems to me particularly\ntrue of writing the monologue, for the monologue is one of those\nprecise forms of the art of writing that may best be compared to\nthe miniature, where every stroke must be true and unhesitating\nand where all combine unerringly to form the composite whole.",
        "In preparing monologue material the writer usually is working in\nthe sounds of spoken–and mis-spoken–words, and the humor that\nlies in the twisting of ideas into surprising conclusions.  He\nseldom deliberately searches for a theme–more often some\nlaugh-provoking incident or sentence gives him an idea and he\nbuilds it into a monologue with its subject for the theme.",
        "Anything at all in the whole range of subjects with which life\nabounds will lend itself for a monologue theme–provided the writer\ncan without straining twist it to the angle of humor; but propriety\ndemands that nothing blatantly suggestive shall be treated, and\ncommon sense dictates that no theme of merely local interest shall\nbe used, when the purpose of the monologue is to entertain the\nwhole country.  Of course if a monologue is designed to entertain\nmerely a certain class or the residents of a certain city or section\nonly, the very theme–for instance, some purely local happening\nor trade interest–that you would avoid using in a monologue planned\nfor national use, would be the happiest theme that could be chosen.\nBut, as the ambitious monologue writer does not wish to confine\nhimself to a local or a sectional subject and market, let us\nconsider here only themes that have universal appeal.",
        "      Politics                  Woman Suffrage\n      Love                      Drink\n      Marriage                  Baseball\n      Woman’s Dress             Money",
        "While there are many more themes that can be twisted to universal\ninterest–and anyone could multiply the number given–these few\nare used in whole or in part in nearly every successful monologue\nnow being presented.  And, they offer to the new writer the surest\nground to build a new monologue.  That they have all been done\nbefore is no reason why they should not be done again:  the new\nauthor has only to do them better–and a little different.  It is\nall a matter of fresh vision.  What is there in any art that is\nreally new–but treatment?",
        "Do not make the fatal mistake of supposing that these few themes\nare the only themes possessing universal interest.  Anything in\nthe whole wide world may be the subject for a monologue, when\ntransmuted by the magic of common sense and uncommon ability into\nuniversal fun.",
        "As a monologue is a collection of carefully selected and smoothly\nblended points or gags, with a suitable introduction to the routine\n[1]–each point and gag being a complete, separate entity, and the\nintroduction being as truly distinct–the monologue writer, unlike\nthe playlet writer, may begin to write anywhere.  He may even write\nthe last point or gag used in the routine before he writes the\nfirst.  Or he may write the twelfth point before he writes either\nthe first one or the last one.  But usually, he writes his\nintroduction first.",
        "[1] Routine–the entire monologue; but more often used to suggest\nits arrangement and construction.  A monologue with its gags and\npoints arranged in a certain order is one routine; a different\nroutine is used when the gags or points are arranged in a different\norder.  Thus routine means arrangement.  The word is also used to\ndescribe the arrangement of other stage offerings–for instance, a\ndance:  the same steps arranged in a different order make a new\n“dance routine.”",
        "A monologue introduction may be just one line with a point or a\ngag that will raise a snicker, or it may be a long introduction\nthat stamps the character as a “character,” and causes amusement\nbecause it introduces the entire monologue theme in a bright way.",
        "An example of the short introduction is:",
        "“D’you know me friend Casey?  He’s the guy that put the sham in\nshamrock,” then on into the first gag that stamps Casey as a\nsure-’nuff “character,” with a giggle-point to the gag.",
        "The very best example of the long introduction being done on the\nstage today is the first four paragraphs of “The German Senator.\"\nThe first line, “My dear friends and falling Citizens,” stamps the\nmonologue unquestionably as a speech.  The second line, “My heart\nfills up with vaccination to be disabled,” declares the mixed-up\ncharacter of the oration and of the German Senator himself, and\ncauses amusement.  And the end of the fourth paragraph–which you\nwill note is one long involved sentence filled with giggles–raises\nthe first laugh.",
        "Nat Wills says the introduction to the gag-monologue may often\nprofitably open with a “local\"–one about the town or some local\nhappening–as a local is pretty sure to raise a giggle, and will\ncause the audience to think the monologist “bright” and at least\nstart their relations off pleasantly.  He says:  “Work for giggles\nin your introduction, but don’t let the audience get set–with a\nbig laugh–until the fifth or sixth joke.”",
        "The introduction, therefore, is designed to establish the monologist\nwith the audience as “bright,” to stamp the character of the\n“character” delivering it–or about whom the gags are told–and\nto delay a big laugh until the monologist has “got” his audience.",
        "The “point,” you will recall, we defined as the funny observation\nof a pure monologue–in lay-conversation it means the laugh line\nof a joke; and “gag” we defined as a joke or a pun.  For the sake\nof clearness let us confine “point” to a funny observation in a\nmonologue, and “gag” to a joke in a connected series of stories.",
        "It is impossible for anyone to teach you how to write a really\nfunny point or a gag.  But, if you have a well-developed sense of\nhumor, you can, with the help of the suggestions for form given\nhere and the examples of humor printed in the appendix, and those\nyou will find in the funny papers and hear along the street or on\nthe stage, teach yourself to write saleable material.  All that\nthis chapter can hope to do for you is to show you how the best\nmonologue writes and the most successful monologists work to achieve\ntheir notable results, and thus put you in the right path to\naccomplish, with the least waste of time and energy, what they\nhave done.",
        "Therefore, let us suppose that you know what is humorous, have a\nwell-developed sense of humor, and can produce really funny points\nand gags.  Now, having your points and gags clearly framed in mind\nand ready to set down on paper, you naturally ask, How shall I\narrange them?  In what order shall I place them to secure the best\neffect for the whole monologue?",
        "Barrett Wendell, professor of English at Harvard University, [1]\nhas suggested an effective mechanical aid for determining the\nclearest and best arrangement of sentences and paragraphs in English\nprose, and his plan seems especially adapted to help the monologue\nwriter determine a perfect routine.  Briefly his method may be\nparaphrased thus:",
        "[1] English Composition, page 165.",
        "Have as many cards or slips of paper as you have points or gags.\nWrite only one point or gag on one card or slip of paper.  On the\nfirst card write “Introduction,” and always keep that card first\nin your hand.  Then take up a card and read the point or gag on\nit as following the introduction, the second card as the second\npoint or gag, and so on until you have arranged your monologue in\nan effective routine.",
        "Then try another arrangement.  Let us say the tenth joke in the\nfirst routine reads better as the first joke.  All right, place\nit in your new arrangement right after the introduction.  Perhaps\nthe fourteenth point or gag fits in well after the tenth gag–fine,\nmake that fourteenth gag the second gag; and so on through your\ncards until you have arranged a new routine.",
        "Your first arrangement can invariably be improved–maybe even your\nseventh arrangement can be made better; very good, by shuffiing\nthe cards you may make as many arrangements as you wish and\neventually arrive at the ideal routine.  And by keeping a memorandum\nof preceding arrangements you can always turn back to the older\nroutine–if that appears the best after all other arrangements\nhave been tried.",
        "But what is really the ideal arrangement of a monologue?  How may\nyou know which routine is really the best?  Frankly, you cannot\nknow until it has been tried out on an audience many, many\ntimes–and has been proved a success by actual test.  Arranging a\nroutine of untried points and gags on paper is like trying to solve\na cut-out puzzle with the key-piece missing.  Only by actually\ntrying out a monologue before an audience and fitting the points\nand gags to suit the monologist’s peculiar style (indeed, this is\nthe real work of writing a monologue and will be described later\non) can you determine what really is the best routine.  And even\nthen another arrangement may “go” better in another town.  Still\nthere are a few suggestions–a very few–that can be given here\nto aid the beginner.",
        "Like ocean waves, monologic laughs should come in threes and\nnines–proved, like most rules, by exceptions.  Note the application\nof this rule in “The German Senator.”",
        "Study the arrangement of the points in this great monologue and\nyou will see that each really big point is dependent on several\nminor points that precede it to get its own big laugh.  For instance,\ntake the following point:",
        "  And if meat goes any higher, it will be worth more than money.",
        "  Then there won’t be any money.",
        "  Instead of carrying money in your pocket, you’ll carry meat\n  around.",
        "  A sirloin steak will be worth a thousand dollar bill.",
        "  When you go down to the bank to make a deposit, instead of giving\n  the cashier a thousand dollar bill, you’ll slip him a sirloin\n  steak.",
        "  If you ask him for change, he’ll give you a hunk of bologny.\n  \nThe first line blends this point with the preceding one about\nthe high cost of eggs.  The second line awakens interest and\nprepares for the next, “Instead of carrying money in your pocket,\nyou’ll carry meat around,” which is good for a grin.  The next\nline states the premise necessary for the first point-ending\n“–you’ll slip him a sirloin steak,” which is always good for a\nlaugh.  Then the last line, “If you ask him for change, he’ll\ngive you a hunk of bologny,” tops the preceding laugh.",
        "From this example you see what is meant by monologic laughs coming\nin threes and nines.  The introduction of each new story–the line\nafter the blend-line–should awaken a grin, its development cause\na chuckle, and the point-line itself raise a laugh.",
        "Each new point should top the preceding point until with the end\nof that particular angle or situation, should come a roar of honest\nlaughter.  Then back to the grin, the chuckle, and on to the laugh\nagain, building up to the next big roar.",
        "With the end of the monologue should come complete satisfaction\nin one great burst of laughter.  This, of course, is the ideal.",
        "A monologue should run anywhere from ten to fifteen minutes.  The\nmonologist can vary his playing time at will by leaving out points\nand gags here and there, as necessity demands, so the writer should\nsupply at least a full fifteen minutes of material in his manuscript.",
        "“How shall I time my manuscript?” is the puzzling problem the new\nwriter asks himself.  The answer is that it is very difficult to\ntime a monologue exactly, because different performers work at\ndifferent speeds and laughs delay the delivery and, therefore,\nmake the monologue run longer.  But here is a very rough counting\nscale that may be given, with the warning that it is far from\nexact:",
        "For every one hundred and fifteen to one hundred and forty words\ncount one minute for delivery.  This is so inexact, depending as\nit does on the number of laughs and the monologist’s speed of\ndelivery, that it is like a rubber ruler.  At one performance it\nmay be too long, at another too short.",
        "Having given a full fifteen minutes of material, filled, let us\nhope, with good points made up of grins, chuckles and laughs, now\nchoose your very biggest laugh-point for the last.  When you wrote\nthe monologue and arranged it into the first routine, that biggest\nlaugh may have been the tenth, or the ninth, or the fifteenth, but\nyou have spotted it unerringly as the very biggest laugh you\npossess, so you blend it in as the final laugh of the completed\nmonologue.",
        "It may now be worth while thus to sum up the ideal structure:",
        "A routine is so arranged that the introduction stamps the monologist\nas bright, and the character he is impersonating or telling about\nas a real “character.”  The first four points or gags are snickers\nand the fifth or sixth is a laugh. [1] Each point or gag blends\nperfectly into the ones preceding and following it.  The introduction\nof each new story awakens a grin, its development causes a chuckle,\nand the point-line itself raises a laugh.  The final point or gag\nrounds the monologue off in the biggest burst of honest laughter.",
        "[1] It is true that some monologists strive for a laugh on the\nvery first point, but to win a big laugh at once is very rare.",
        "When a writer delivers the manuscript of a monologue to a monologist\nhis work is not ended.  It has just begun, because he must share\nwith the monologist the pains of delivering the monologue before\nan audience.  Dion Boucicault once said, “A play is not written,\nbut rewritten.”  True as this is of a play, it is, if possible,\neven more true of a monologue.",
        "Of course, not all beginners can afford to give this personal\nattention to staging a monologue, but it is advisable whenever\npossible.  For, points that the author and the monologist himself\nwere sure would “go big,” “die,” while points and gags that neither\nthought much of, “go big.”  It is for precisely this purpose of\nweeding out the good points and gags from the bad that even famous\nmonologists “hide away,” under other names, in very small houses\nfor try-outs.  And while the monologist is working on the stage\nto make the points and gags “get over,” the author is working in\nthe audience to note the effect of points and finding ways to\nchange a phrase here and a word there to build dead points into\nlife and laughter.  Then it is that they both realize that Frank\nFogarty’s wise words are true:  “There is only one way to tell a\ngag.  If you can cut one word out from any of my gags I’ll give\nyou five dollars, for it’s worth fifty to me.  Words are costly.”",
        "Some entire points and gags will be found to be dead beyond\nresurrection, and even whole series of gags and points must be\ncast away and new and better ones substituted to raise the golden\nlaughs.  So the monologue is changed and built performance after\nperformance, with both the monologist and the author working as\nthough their very lives depended on making it perfect.",
        "Then, when it is “set” to the satisfaction of both, the monologist\ngoes out on the road to try it out on different audiences and to\nwrite the author continually for new points and gags.  It may be\nsaid with perfect truth that a monologue is never finished.  Nat\nWills, the Tramp Monologist, pays James Madison a weekly salary\nto supply him with new jokes every seventh day.  So, nearly every\nmonologist retains the author to keep him up to the minute with\nmaterial, right in the forefront of the laughter-of-the-hour.",
        "The discussion of the monologue form has been exhaustive, for the\npure monologue holds within itself all the elements of the other\nallied forms.  The only difference between a pure monologue and\nany other kind is in the addition of entertainment features that\nare not connected gags and points.  Therefore, to cover the field\ncompletely it is necessary only to name a few of the many different\nkinds of single talking acts and to describe them briefly.",
        "The most common talking singles–all of whom buy material from\nvaudeville writers–are:",
        "(a) The Talking Magician–who may have only a few little tricks\nto present, but who plays them up big because he sprinkles his\nwork with laughter-provoking points.",
        "(b) The “Nut Comedian”–who does all manner of silly tricks to\nmake his audience laugh, but who has a carefully prepared routine\nof “nut” material.",
        "(c) The Parody Monologist–who opens and closes with funny\nparodies on the latest song hits and does a monologue routine\nbetween songs.",
        "(d) The “Original Talk” Impersonator–who does impersonations\nof celebrities, but adds to his offering a few clever points and\ngags.",
        "Before you seek a market [1] for your monologue, be sure that it\nfulfills all the requirements of a monologue and that it is the very\nbest work you can do.  Above all, make sure that every gag or point\nyou use is original with you, and that the angle of the subject you\nhave selected for your theme is honestly your own.  For if you have\ncopied even one gag or point that has been used before, you have laid\nyour work open to suspicion and yourself to the epithet of “chooser.”",
        "[1] See Chapter XXIV, Manuscripts and Markets.",
        "The infringer–who steals gags and points bodily–can be pursued\nand punished under the copyright law, but the chooser is a kind\nof sneak thief who works gags and points around to escape taking\ncriminal chances, making his material just enough different to\nevade the law.  A chooser damages the originator of the material\nwithout himself getting very far.  No one likes a chooser; no one\nknowingly will have dealings with a chooser.  Call a vaudeville\nman a liar and he may laugh at you–call him a chooser and you’ll\nhave to fight him.",
        "There are, of course, deliberate choosers in the vaudeville business,\njust as there are “crooks” in every line of life, but they never\nmake more than a momentary success.  Here is why they invariably\nfail:",
        "When you sit in the audience, and hear an old gag or point, you\nwhisper, “Phew, that’s old,” or you give your companion a knowing\nlook, don’t you?  Well, half the audience is doing the very same\nthing, and they, like you, receive the impression that all the\ngags are old, and merely suppose that they haven’t heard the other\nones before.",
        "The performer, whose bread and butter depends on the audience\nthinking him bright, cannot afford to have anything ancient in his\nroutine.  Two familiar gags or points will kill at least twenty-five\npercent of his applause.  He may not get even one bow, and when\naudiences do not like a monologist well enough to call him out for\na bow, he might as well say good-by to his chances of getting even\nanother week’s booking.  Therefore the performer watches the\nmaterial that is offered him with the strained attention of an\nAsiatic potentate who suspects there is poison in his breakfast\nfood.  He not only guards against old gags or points, but he takes\ngreat care that the specific form of the subject of any routine\nthat he accepts is absolutely new.",
        "Some of the deliberate choosers watch the field very closely and\nas soon as anyone strikes a new vein or angle they proceed to work\nit over.  But taking the same subject and working around it–even\nthough each gag or point is honestly new–does not and cannot pay.\nEven though the chooser secures some actor willing to use such\nmaterial, he fails ultimately for two reasons:  In the first place,\nthe copier is never as good as the originator; and, in the second\nplace, the circuit managers do not look with favor upon copy-acts.",
        "As the success of the performer depends on his cleverness and the\nnovelty of his material, in identically the same way the success\nof a vaudeville theatre lies in the cleverness and novelty of the\nacts it plays.  Individual house managers, and therefore circuit\nmanagers, cannot afford to countenance copy-acts.  For this reason\na monologist or an act is often given exclusive rights to use a\nprecise kind of subject-material over a given circuit.  A copy-act\ncannot keep going to very long with only a few segregated house\nwilling to play his act.",
        "Therefore before you offer your monologue to a possible buyer, be\nsure–absolutely sure–that your theme and every one of your points\nand gags are original.",
