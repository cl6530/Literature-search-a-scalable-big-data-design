        "More common, perhaps, than any other filed against it has been the\nobjection that Odd-Fellowship does its work secretly, this objection\nbeing not unfrequently urged by persons of candor and honest impulses.\n“If,” it is demanded, “the aims and purposes of the order be legitimate\nand praiseworthy, why shroud them in mystery rather than give them the\nbroad sunlight of publicity.”",
        "The objection is not new, nor is it urged with any increase of its\noriginal force, whatever may be the fact in the matter of vehemence.\nAnswer might be made: The order does not choose to ascend to the house\ntops for the purpose of heralding its affairs to the world.  But that\nanswer would not be satisfactory, nor is any likely to be that may be\npresented, now or hereafter.  It is nevertheless true that there are\ncertain matters pertaining to the order and its works with which the\noutside world has no sort of concern, even as with those very peculiar\nsecret societies, the individual, the family, the church and the state.\nIf other organizations prefer to resort to the newspapers, the pulpit,\nthe rostrum and other information conduits for the purpose of\nadvertising their wares, their greatness and their goodness, and the\nvast amount of humanitarian work they are doing and purposing, such is\ntheir unquestioned privilege.",
        "But if the preference of Odd-Fellowship be for quieter and less\nobtrusive methods, pray who shall fairly contest its right of choice?",
        "And then it should be remembered that there are matters in which the\nright hand is prohibited the privilege of interfering with the\nprerogatives of the left, and the left with those of the right.  Nor\nshould the fact be forgotten that there is Divine example, if not\nprecept, for the established “modus operandi” of the order.  Upon a\ncertain occasion the Great Teacher had performed a very humble service\nfor one of his disciples who was sadly at loss for the why and the\nwherefore, and the answer, received to his inquiry was: “What I do thou\nknowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.”",
        "And in the grand hereafter, when the films of ignorance and the\nwarpings of prejudice and superstition shall have melted away under the\nbright sunlight of Eternal Day, it is not impossible that our vexed,\ninquisitive, worrying opponents may be permitted to look back over the\npathway this order has traversed, glance at the work that has been\nwrought and peradventure discover how unreasonable, as well as\nfruitless, has been the warfare they have been pleased to wage with\nsuch persistent fury.  A long time to wait, maybe, but then good things\ndo not come rapidly nor all at once.  Meanwhile, to encourage them in\ntheir waiting, their watching and their worrying, let them take this\nlesson from the same Great Teacher: “The wind bloweth where it listeth,\nand thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh\nor whither it goeth.”  Ah, no! it will not do, because you can not see\nand comprehend all of everything, inside as well as outside, to\nconclude that it must necessarily be bad.  Adopt that theory, and you\nnot only fly in the face of reason, but bump your head against almost\neverything in nature, in art and in science.",
        "Secrets! yes; they are within us and without us, above us and beneath\nus and all about us, and “what are you going to do about it?”  Well\nmight Israel’s old and gifted poet king write: “We are fearfully and\nwonderfully made,” soul and body, the mortal and the immortal, the\nmaterial and the immaterial, strangely and mysteriously conjoined!\nGod’s secret, this!  Will you denounce Him and withdraw allegiance from\nHim, for the reason that He fails to make clear to you a clear and\nsatisfying revelation?  The same old singer said thousands of years\nago, “The Heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth\nHis handiwork.”  And those heavens, with that firmament, are charged\nand surcharged with mightiest and profoundest secrets.  We seize the\ntelescope and “plunge into the vast profound overhead, intent upon\nmastering the secrets of the revolving spheres.”",
        "We travel from star to star, from system to system, until we reach yon\nlonely star that appears to be performing the Guardian’s task, upon the\nverge of unmeasured and immeasurable space.  We may descry and describe\nthe form and outlines of those heavenly bodies, detect their movements\nand approximately determine their distances and dimensions.  But what\nmore?  Little that is satisfying.  When they had a beginning, what\npurposes they subserve in the sublime system of God’s stupendous\nuniverse, and when they shall have a consummation, we may not certainly\nknow.  Secrets, these, and such “Secret things belong unto God.”  We\nwould like to know these secrets, but must wait; for there, “roll those\nmighty worlds that gem the distant sky,” as distantly and dismally as\nwhen Chaldean and Egyptian astronomers and astrologers viewed their\nmovements three thousand years ago, rifled meanwhile of but few of\ntheir well kept secrets.  He that pencils the lily and paints the rose\nand gives to every blade of grass its own bright drop of dew, has been\npleased to say: “Hitherto shalt thou come and no further.”  And there\nis great unwisdom in setting up factious opposition to the fiat of\nOmnipotence.  Possess your souls in patience, O friends! wait, as we\nmust wait, before knowing all, or even knowing much.  If you can not be\nOdd-Fellows, you can at least be men, with an effort.",
