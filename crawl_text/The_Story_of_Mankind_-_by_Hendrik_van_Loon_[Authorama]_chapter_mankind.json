        "THE SCENE OF OUR HISTORY IS LAID UPON A LITTLE PLANET,\nLOST IN THE VASTNESS OF THE UNIVERSE.",
        "To JIMMIE\n\"What is the use of a book without pictures?” said Alice.",
        "For Hansje and Willem:",
        "WHEN I was twelve or thirteen years old, an uncle of\nmine who gave me my love for books and pictures promised\nto take me upon a memorable expedition. I was to go with\nhim to the top of the tower of Old Saint Lawrence in Rotterdam.",
        "And so, one fine day, a sexton with a key as large as that\nof Saint Peter opened a mysterious door. “Ring the bell,\"\nhe said, “when you come back and want to get out,” and with\na great grinding of rusty old hinges he separated us from the\nnoise of the busy street and locked us into a world of new and\nstrange experiences.",
        "For the first time in my life I was confronted by the phenomenon\nof audible silence. When we had climbed the first\nflight of stairs, I added another discovery to my limited\nknowledge of natural phenomena–that of tangible darkness. A\nmatch showed us where the upward road continued. We went\nto the next floor and then to the next and the next until I had\nlost count and then there came still another floor, and suddenly\nwe had plenty of light. This floor was on an even height with\nthe roof of the church, and it was used as a storeroom. Covered\nwith many inches of dust, there lay the abandoned symbols\nof a venerable faith which had been discarded by the good\npeople of the city many years ago. That which had meant life\nand death to our ancestors was here reduced to junk and rub-\nbish. The industrious rat had built his nest among the carved\nimages and the ever watchful spider had opened up shop between\nthe outspread arms of a kindly saint.",
        "The next floor showed us from where we had derived our\nlight. Enormous open windows with heavy iron bars made\nthe high and barren room the roosting place of hundreds of\npigeons. The wind blew through the iron bars and the air was\nfilled with a weird and pleasing music. It was the noise of the\ntown below us, but a noise which had been purified and cleansed\nby the distance. The rumbling of heavy carts and the clinking\nof horses’ hoofs, the winding of cranes and pulleys, the hissing\nsound of the patient steam which had been set to do the work\nof man in a thousand different ways–they had all been\nblended into a softly rustling whisper which provided a beautiful\nbackground for the trembling cooing of the pigeons.",
        "Here the stairs came to an end and the ladders began. And\nafter the first ladder (a slippery old thing which made one feel\nhis way with a cautious foot) there was a new and even greater\nwonder, the town-clock. I saw the heart of time. I could hear\nthe heavy pulsebeats of the rapid seconds–one–two–three–\nup to sixty. Then a sudden quivering noise when all the wheels\nseemed to stop and another minute had been chopped off eternity.\nWithout pause it began again–one–two–three–until\nat last after a warning rumble and the scraping of many wheels\na thunderous voice, high above us, told the world that it was\nthe hour of noon.",
        "On the next floor were the bells. The nice little bells and\ntheir terrible sisters. In the centre the big bell, which made\nme turn stiff with fright when I heard it in the middle of the\nnight telling a story of fire or flood. In solitary grandeur it\nseemed to reflect upon those six hundred years during which\nit had shared the joys and the sorrows of the good people of\nRotterdam. Around it, neatly arranged like the blue jars in\nan old-fashioned apothecary shop, hung the little fellows, who\ntwice each week played a merry tune for the benefit of the\ncountry-folk who had come to market to buy and sell and hear\nwhat the big world had been doing. But in a corner–all alone\nand shunned by the others–a big black bell, silent and stern,\nthe bell of death.",
        "Then darkness once more and other ladders, steeper and\neven more dangerous than those we had climbed before, and\nsuddenly the fresh air of the wide heavens. We had reached\nthe highest gallery. Above us the sky. Below us the city–\na little toy-town, where busy ants were hastily crawling hither\nand thither, each one intent upon his or her particular business,\nand beyond the jumble of stones, the wide greenness of the\nopen country.",
        "It was my first glimpse of the big world.",
        "Since then, whenever I have had the opportunity, I have\ngone to the top of the tower and enjoyed myself. It was hard\nwork, but it repaid in full the mere physical exertion of climbing\na few stairs.",
        "Besides, I knew what my reward would be. I would see the\nland and the sky, and I would listen to the stories of my kind\nfriend the watchman, who lived in a small shack, built in a\nsheltered corner of the gallery. He looked after the clock\nand was a father to the bells, and he warned of fires, but he\nenjoyed many free hours and then he smoked a pipe and\nthought his own peaceful thoughts. He had gone to school almost\nfifty years before and he had rarely read a book, but he\nhad lived on the top of his tower for so many years that he had\nabsorbed the wisdom of that wide world which surrounded him\non all sides.",
        "History he knew well, for it was a living thing with him.\n\"There,” he would say, pointing to a bend of the river, “there,\nmy boy, do you see those trees? That is where the Prince of\nOrange cut the dikes to drown the land and save Leyden.\"\nOr he would tell me the tale of the old Meuse, until the broad\nriver ceased to be a convenient harbour and became a wonderful\nhighroad, carrying the ships of De Ruyter and Tromp upon\nthat famous last voyage, when they gave their lives that the\nsea might be free to all.",
        "Then there were the little villages, clustering around the\nprotecting church which once, many years ago, had been the\nhome of their Patron Saints. In the distance we could see the\nleaning tower of Delft. Within sight of its high arches,\nWilliam the Silent had been murdered and there Grotius had\nlearned to construe his first Latin sentences. And still further\naway, the long low body of the church of Gouda, the early home\nof the man whose wit had proved mightier than the armies of\nmany an emperor, the charity-boy whom the world came to\nknow as Erasmus.",
        "Finally the silver line of the endless sea and as a contrast,\nimmediately below us, the patchwork of roofs and chimneys\nand houses and gardens and hospitals and schools and railways,\nwhich we called our home. But the tower showed us\nthe old home in a new light. The confused commotion of the\nstreets and the market-place, of the factories and the workshop,\nbecame the well-ordered expression of human energy\nand purpose. Best of all, the wide view of the glorious past,\nwhich surrounded us on all sides, gave us new courage to face\nthe problems of the future when we had gone back to our daily\ntasks.",
        "History is the mighty Tower of Experience, which Time\nhas built amidst the endless fields of bygone ages. It is no easy\ntask to reach the top of this ancient structure and get the benefit\nof the full view. There is no elevator, but young feet are\nstrong and it can be done.",
        "Here I give you the key that will open the door.",
        "When you return, you too will understand the reason for\nmy enthusiasm.\n                                   HENDRIK WILLEM VAN LOON.",
        "HIGH Up in the North in the land called Svithjod, there\nstands a rock. It is a hundred miles high and a hundred miles\nwide. Once every thousand years a little bird comes to this\nrock to sharpen its beak.",
        "When the rock has thus been worn away, then a single day\nof eternity will have gone by.",
        "THE SETTING OF THE STAGE",
        "WE live under the shadow of a gigantic question mark.",
        "Who are we?",
        "Where do we come from?",
        "Whither are we bound?",
        "Slowly, but with persistent courage, we have been pushing\nthis question mark further and further towards that distant\nline, beyond the horizon, where we hope to find our answer.",
        "We have not gone very far.",
        "We still know very little but we have reached the point\nwhere (with a fair degree of accuracy) we can guess at many\nthings.",
        "In this chapter I shall tell you how (according to our best\nbelief) the stage was set for the first appearance of man.",
        "If we represent the time during which it has been possible for\nanimal life to exist upon our planet by a line of this length,\nthen the tiny line just below indicates the age during which\nman (or a creature more or less resembling man) has lived\nupon this earth.",
        "Man was the last to come but the first to use his brain for\nthe purpose of conquering the forces of nature. That is the\nreason why we are going to study him, rather than cats or\ndogs or horses or any of the other animals, who, all in their\nown way, have a very interesting historical development behind\nthem.",
        "In the beginning, the planet upon which we live was (as far\nas we now know) a large ball of flaming matter, a tiny cloud of\nsmoke in the endless ocean of space. Gradually, in the course\nof millions of years, the surface burned itself out, and was covered\nwith a thin layer of rocks. Upon these lifeless rocks the\nrain descended in endless torrents, wearing out the hard\ngranite and carrying the dust to the valleys that lay hidden between\nthe high cliffs of the steaming earth.",
        "Finally the hour came when the sun broke through the\nclouds and saw how this little planet was covered with a few\nsmall puddles which were to develop into the mighty oceans of\nthe eastern and western hemispheres.",
        "Then one day the great wonder happened. What had been\ndead, gave birth to life.",
        "The first living cell floated upon the waters of the sea.",
        "For millions of years it drifted aimlessly with the currents.\nBut during all that time it was developing certain habits that\nit might survive more easily upon the inhospitable earth. Some\nof these cells were happiest in the dark depths of the lakes and\nthe pools. They took root in the slimy sediments which had\nbeen carried down from the tops of the hills and they became\nplants. Others preferred to move about and they grew\nstrange jointed legs, like scorpions and began to crawl along\nthe bottom of the sea amidst the plants and the pale green things\nthat looked like jelly-fishes. Still others (covered with scales)\ndepended upon a swimming motion to go from place to place\nin their search for food, and gradually they populated the ocean\nwith myriads of fishes.",
        "Meanwhile the plants had increased in number and they had\nto search for new dwelling places. There was no more room\nfor them at the bottom of the sea. Reluctantly they left the\nwater and made a new home in the marshes and on the mud-\nbanks that lay at the foot of the mountains. Twice a day the\ntides of the ocean covered them with their brine. For the rest\nof the time, the plants made the best of their uncomfortable\nsituation and tried to survive in the thin air which surrounded\nthe surface of the planet. After centuries of training, they\nlearned how to live as comfortably in the air as they had done in\nthe water. They increased in size and became shrubs and trees\nand at last they learned how to grow lovely flowers which\nattracted the attention of the busy big bumble-bees and the\nbirds who carried the seeds far and wide until the whole earth\nhad become covered with green pastures, or lay dark under the\nshadow of the big trees. But some of the fishes too\nhad begun to leave the sea, and they had learned how to breathe\nwith lungs as well as with gills. We call such creatures amphibious,\nwhich means that they are able to live with equal ease on the land\nand in the water. The first frog who crosses your path can tell you\nall about the pleasures of the double existence of the amphibian.",
        "Once outside of the water, these animals gradually adapted\nthemselves more and more to life on land. Some became reptiles\n(creatures who crawl like lizards) and they shared the\nsilence of the forests with the insects. That they might move\nfaster through the soft soil, they improved upon their legs\nand their size increased until the world was populated with\ngigantic forms (which the hand-books of biology list under\nthe names of Ichthyosaurus and Megalosaurus and Brontosaurus)\nwho grew to be thirty to forty feet long and who could have\nplayed with elephants as a full grown cat plays with her kittens.",
        "Some of the members of this reptilian family began to live in\nthe tops of the trees, which were then often more than a hundred\nfeet high. They no longer needed their legs for the purpose\nof walking, but it was necessary for them to move quickly from\nbranch to branch. And so they changed a part of their skin\ninto a sort of parachute, which stretched between the sides of\ntheir bodies and the small toes of their fore-feet, and gradually\nthey covered this skinny parachute with feathers and made\ntheir tails into a steering gear and flew from tree to tree and\ndeveloped into true birds.",
        "Then a strange thing happened. All the gigantic reptiles\ndied within a short time. We do not know the reason. Perhaps\nit was due to a sudden change in climate. Perhaps they\nhad grown so large that they could neither swim nor walk nor\ncrawl, and they starved to death within sight but not within\nreach of the big ferns and trees. Whatever the cause, the\nmillion year old world-empire of the big reptiles was over.",
        "The world now began to be occupied by very different\ncreatures. They were the descendants of the reptiles but they\nwere quite unlike these because they fed their young from the\n\"mammae” or the breasts of the mother. Wherefore modern\nscience calls these animals “mammals.” They had shed the\nscales of the fish. They did not adopt the feathers of the bird,\nbut they covered their bodies with hair. The mammals however\ndeveloped other habits which gave their race a great advantage\nover the other animals. The female of the species\ncarried the eggs of the young inside her body until they were\nhatched and while all other living beings, up to that time, had\nleft their children exposed to the dangers of cold and heat,\nand the attacks of wild beasts, the mammals kept their young\nwith them for a long time and sheltered them while they were\nstill too weak to fight their enemies. In this way the young\nmammals were given a much better chance to survive, because\nthey learned many things from their mothers, as you will know\nif you have ever watched a cat teaching her kittens to take\ncare of themselves and how to wash their faces and how to\ncatch mice.",
        "But of these mammals I need not tell you much for you\nknow them well. They surround you on all sides. They are\nyour daily companions in the streets and in your home, and you\ncan see your less familiar cousins behind the bars of the zoological\ngarden.",
        "And now we come to the parting of the ways when man\nsuddenly leaves the endless procession of dumbly living and\ndying creatures and begins to use his reason to shape the\ndestiny of his race.",
        "One mammal in particular seemed to surpass all others in\nits ability to find food and shelter. It had learned to use its\nfore-feet for the purpose of holding its prey, and by dint of\npractice it had developed a hand-like claw. After innumerable\nattempts it had learned how to balance the whole of the\nbody upon the hind legs. (This is a difficult act, which every\nchild has to learn anew although the human race has been\ndoing it for over a million years.)",
        "This creature, half ape and half monkey but superior to\nboth, became the most successful hunter and could make a\nliving in every clime. For greater safety, it usually moved\nabout in groups. It learned how to make strange grunts to\nwarn its young of approaching danger and after many hundreds\nof thousands of years it began to use these throaty noises\nfor the purpose of talking.",
        "This creature, though you may hardly believe it, was your\nfirst “man-like” ancestor.",
        "WE know very little about the first “true” men. We have\nnever seen their pictures. In the deepest layer of clay of an\nancient soil we have sometimes found pieces of their bones.\nThese lay buried amidst the broken skeletons of other animals\nthat have long since disappeared from the face of the earth.\nAnthropologists (learned scientists who devote their lives to\nthe study of man as a member of the animal kingdom) have\ntaken these bones and they have been able to reconstruct our\nearliest ancestors with a fair degree of accuracy.",
        "The great-great-grandfather of the human race was a very\nugly and unattractive mammal. He was quite small, much\nsmaller than the people of today. The heat of the sun and the\nbiting wind of the cold winter had coloured his skin a dark\nbrown. His head and most of his body, his arms and legs too,\nwere covered with long, coarse hair. He had very thin but\nstrong fingers which made his hands look like those of a monkey.\nHis forehead was low and his jaw was like the jaw of a\nwild animal which uses its teeth both as fork and knife. He\nwore no clothes. He had seen no fire except the flames of the\nrumbling volcanoes which filled the earth with their smoke\nand their lava.",
        "He lived in the damp blackness of vast forests, as the\npygmies of Africa do to this very day. When he felt the\npangs of hunger he ate raw leaves and the roots of plants or\nhe took the eggs away from an angry bird and fed them to his\nown young. Once in a while, after a long and patient chase,\nhe would catch a sparrow or a small wild dog or perhaps a\nrabbit. These he would eat raw for he had never discovered\nthat food tasted better when it was cooked.",
        "During the hours of day, this primitive human being\nprowled about looking for things to eat.",
        "When night descended upon the earth, he hid his wife and\nhis children in a hollow tree or behind some heavy boulders,\nfor he was surrounded on all sides by ferocious animals and\nwhen it was dark these animals began to prowl about, looking\nfor something to eat for their mates and their own young, and\nthey liked the taste of human beings. It was a world where\nyou must either eat or be eaten, and life was very unhappy\nbecause it was full of fear and misery.",
        "In summer, man was exposed to the scorching rays of the\nsun, and during the winter his children would freeze to death\nin his arms. When such a creature hurt itself, (and hunting\nanimals are forever breaking their bones or spraining their\nankles) he had no one to take care of him and he must die a\nhorrible death.",
        "Like many of the animals who fill the Zoo with their\nstrange noises, early man liked to jabber. That is to say, he\nendlessly repeated the same unintelligible gibberish because it\npleased him to hear the sound of his voice. In due time he\nlearned that he could use this guttural noise to warn his fellow\nbeings whenever danger threatened and he gave certain little\nshrieks which came to mean “there is a tiger!” or “here come\nfive elephants.” Then the others grunted something back at\nhim and their growl meant, “I see them,” or “let us run away\nand hide.” And this was probably the origin of all language.",
        "But, as I have said before, of these beginnings we know\nso very little. Early man had no tools and he built himself\nno houses. He lived and died and left no trace of his existence\nexcept a few collar-bones and a few pieces of his skull.\nThese tell us that many thousands of years ago the world was\ninhabited by certain mammals who were quite different from\nall the other animals–who had probably developed from another\nunknown ape-like animal which had learned to walk on\nits hind-legs and use its fore-paws as hands–and who were\nmost probably connected with the creatures who happen to be\nour own immediate ancestors.",
        "It is little enough we know and the rest is darkness.",
        "PREHISTORIC MAN BEGINS TO MAKE\nTHINGS FOR HIMSELF.",
        "EARLY man did not know what time meant. He kept\nno records of birthdays or wedding anniversaries or the hour\nof death. He had no idea of days or weeks or even years.\nBut in a general way he kept track of the seasons for he had\nnoticed that the cold winter was invariably followed by the mild\nspring–that spring grew into the hot summer when fruits\nripened and the wild ears of corn were ready to be eaten and\nthat summer ended when sudden gusts of wind swept the leaves\nfrom the trees and a number of animals were getting ready\nfor the long hibernal sleep.",
        "But now, something unusual and rather frightening had\nhappened. Something was the matter with the weather. The\nwarm days of summer had come very late. The fruits had\nnot ripened. The tops of the mountains which used to be covered\nwith grass now lay deeply hidden underneath a heavy\nburden of snow.",
        "Then, one morning, a number of wild people, different\nfrom the other creatures who lived in that neighbourhood, came\nwandering down from the region of the high peaks. They\nlooked lean and appeared to be starving. They uttered sounds\nwhich no one could understand. They seemed to say that\nthey were hungry. There was not food enough for both the\nold inhabitants and the newcomers. When they tried to stay\nmore than a few days there was a terrible battle with claw-like\nhands and feet and whole families were killed. The others fled\nback to their mountain slopes and died in the next blizzard.",
        "But the people in the forest were greatly frightened. All\nthe time the days grew shorter and the nights grew colder than\nthey ought to have been.",
        "Finally, in a gap between two high hills, there appeared a\ntiny speck of greenish ice. Rapidly it increased in size. A\ngigantic glacier came sliding downhill. Huge stones were\nbeing pushed into the valley. With the noise of a dozen thunderstorms\ntorrents of ice and mud and blocks of granite suddenly\ntumbled among the people of the forest and killed them\nwhile they slept. Century old trees were crushed into kindling\nwood. And then it began to snow.",
        "It snowed for months and months. All the plants died and\nthe animals fled in search of the southern sun. Man hoisted\nhis young upon his back and followed them. But he could not\ntravel as fast as the wilder creatures and he was forced to\nchoose between quick thinking or quick dying. He seems to\nhave preferred the former for he has managed to survive the\nterrible glacial periods which upon four different occasions\nthreatened to kill every human being on the face of the earth.",
        "In the first place it was necessary that man clothe himself\nlest he freeze to death. He learned how to dig holes and cover\nthem with branches and leaves and in these traps he caught\nbears and hyenas, which he then killed with heavy stones and\nwhose skins he used as coats for himself and his family.",
        "Next came the housing problem. This was simple. Many\nanimals were in the habit of sleeping in dark caves. Man now\nfollowed their example, drove the animals out of their warm\nhomes and claimed them for his own.",
        "Even so, the climate was too severe for most people and\nthe old and the young died at a terrible rate. Then a genius\nbethought himself of the use of fire. Once, while out hunting,\nhe had been caught in a forest-fire. He remembered that he\nhad been almost roasted to death by the flames. Thus far fire\nhad been an enemy. Now it became a friend. A dead tree\nwas dragged into the cave and lighted by means of smouldering\nbranches from a burning wood. This turned the cave into\na cozy little room.",
        "And then one evening a dead chicken fell into the fire. It\nwas not rescued until it had been well roasted. Man discovered\nthat meat tasted better when cooked and he then and there\ndiscarded one of the old habits which he had shared with the\nother animals and began to prepare his food.",
        "In this way thousands of years passed. Only the people\nwith the cleverest brains survived. They had to struggle day\nand night against cold and hunger. They were forced to invent\ntools. They learned how to sharpen stones into axes and how\nto make hammers. They were obliged to put up large stores\nof food for the endless days of the winter and they found that\nclay could be made into bowls and jars and hardened in the\nrays of the sun. And so the glacial period, which had threatened\nto destroy the human race, became its greatest teacher\nbecause it forced man to use his brain.",
        "THE EGYPTIANS INVENT THE ART OF\nWRITING AND THE RECORD OF\nHISTORY BEGINS",
        "THESE earliest ancestors of ours who lived in the great\nEuropean wilderness were rapidly learning many new things.\nIt is safe to say that in due course of time they would have\ngiven up the ways of savages and would have developed a\ncivilisation of their own. But suddenly there came an end to\ntheir isolation. They were discovered.",
        "A traveller from an unknown southland who had dared to\ncross the sea and the high mountain passes had found his way\nto the wild people of the European continent. He came from\nAfrica. His home was in Egypt.",
        "The valley of the Nile had developed a high stage of civilisation\nthousands of years before the people of the west had\ndreamed of the possibilities of a fork or a wheel or a house.\nAnd we shall therefore leave our great-great-grandfathers in\ntheir caves, while we visit the southern and eastern shores of\nthe Mediterranean, where stood the earliest school of the\nhuman race.",
        "The Egyptians have taught us many things. They were\nexcellent farmers. They knew all about irrigation. They built\ntemples which were afterwards copied by the Greeks and which\nserved as the earliest models for the churches in which we worship\nnowadays. They had invented a calendar which proved\nsuch a useful instrument for the purpose of measuring time\nthat it has survived with a few changes until today. But most\nimportant of all, the Egyptians had learned how to preserve\nspeech for the benefit of future generations. They had invented\nthe art of writing.",
        "We are so accustomed to newspapers and books and magazines\nthat we take it for granted that the world has always been\nable to read and write. As a matter of fact, writing, the most\nimportant of all inventions, is quite new. Without written\ndocuments we would be like cats and dogs, who can only teach\ntheir kittens and their puppies a few simple things and who,\nbecause they cannot write, possess no way in which they can\nmake use of the experience of those generations of cats and\ndogs that have gone before.",
        "In the first century before our era, when the Romans came\nto Egypt, they found the valley full of strange little pictures\nwhich seemed to have something to do with the history\nof the country. But the Romans were not interested in “anything\nforeign” and did not inquire into the origin of these queer\nfigures which covered the walls of the temples and the walls of\nthe palaces and endless reams of flat sheets made out of the\npapyrus reed. The last of the Egyptian priests who had\nunderstood the holy art of making such pictures had died several\nyears before. Egypt deprived of its independence had\nbecome a store-house filled with important historical documents\nwhich no one could decipher and which were of no earthly use\nto either man or beast.",
        "Seventeen centuries went by and Egypt remained a land\nof mystery. But in the year 1798 a French general by the\nname of Bonaparte happened to visit eastern Africa to prepare\nfor an attack upon the British Indian Colonies. He did\nnot get beyond the Nile, and his campaign was a failure. But,\nquite accidentally, the famous French expedition solved the\nproblem of the ancient Egyptian picture-language.",
        "One day a young French officer, much bored by the dreary\nlife of his little fortress on the Rosetta river (a mouth of the\nNile) decided to spend a few idle hours rummaging among\nthe ruins of the Nile Delta. And behold! he found a stone\nwhich greatly puzzled him. Like everything else in Egypt\nit was covered with little figures. But this particular slab of\nblack basalt was different from anything that had ever been\ndiscovered. It carried three inscriptions. One of these was\nin Greek. The Greek language was known. “All that is\nnecessary,” so he reasoned, “is to compare the Greek text with\nthe Egyptian figures, and they will at once tell their secrets.”",
        "The plan sounded simple enough but it took more than\ntwenty years to solve the riddle. In the year 1802 a French\nprofessor by the name of Champollion began to compare the\nGreek and the Egyptian texts of the famous Rosetta stone. In\nthe year 1823 he announced that he had discovered the meaning\nof fourteen little figures. A short time later he died from\noverwork, but the main principles of Egyptian writing had\nbecome known. Today the story of the valley of the Nile is\nbetter known to us than the story of the Mississippi River.\nWe possess a written record which covers four thousand years\nof chronicled history.",
        "As the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics (the word means\n\"sacred writing”) have played such a very great role in\nhistory, (a few of them in modified form have even found their\nway into our own alphabet,) you ought to know something\nabout the ingenious system which was used fifty centuries ago\nto preserve the spoken word for the benefit of the coming\ngenerations.",
        "Of course, you know what a sign language is. Every\nIndian story of our western plains has a chapter devoted to\nstrange messages writter{sic} in the form of little pictures which\ntell how many buffaloes were killed and how many hunters\nthere were in a certain party. As a rule it is not difficult to\nunderstand the meaning of such messages.",
        "Ancient Egyptian, however, was not a sign language. The\nclever people of the Nile had passed beyond that stage long\nbefore. Their pictures meant a great deal more than the object\nwhich they represented, as I shall try to explain to you now.",
        "Suppose that you were Champollion, and that you were\nexamining a stack of papyrus sheets, all covered with hieroglyphics.\nSuddenly you came across a picture of a man with\na saw. “Very well,” you would say, “that means of course that\na farmer went out to cut down a tree.” Then you take another\npapyrus. It tells the story of a queen who had died at the age\nof eighty-two. In the midst of a sentence appears the picture\nof the man with the saw. Queens of eighty-two do not handle\nsaws. The picture therefore must mean something else. But\nwhat?",
        "That is the riddle which the Frenchman finally solved.\nHe discovered that the Egyptians were the first to use what\nwe now call “phonetic writing\"–a system of characters which\nreproduce the “sound” (or phone) of the spoken word and\nwhich make it possible for us to translate all our spoken words\ninto a written form, with the help of only a few dots and dashes\nand pothooks.",
        "Let us return for a moment to the little fellow with the saw.\nThe word “saw” either means a certain tool which you will find\nin a carpenter’s shop, or it means the past tense of the verb\n\"to see.”",
        "This is what had happened to the word during the course\nof centuries. First of all it had meant only the particular tool\nwhich it represented. Then that meaning had been lost and it\nhad become the past participle of a verb. After several hundred\nyears, the Egyptians lost sight of both these meanings and\nthe picture {illust.} came to stand for a single letter, the\nletter S. A short sentence will show you what I mean. Here\nis a modern English sentence as it would have been written in\nhieroglyphics. {illust.}",
        "The {illust.} either means one of these two round objects\nin your head, which allow you to see or it means “I,” the person\nwho is talking.",
        "A {illust.} is either an insect which gathers honey, or it\nrepresents the verb “to be” which means to exist. Again, it\nmay be the first part of a verb like “be-come” or “be-have.\"\nIn this particular instance it is followed by {illust.} which\nmeans a “leaf” or “leave” or “lieve” (the sound of all three\nwords is the same).",
        "The “eye” you know all about.",
        "Finally you get the picture of a {illust.}. It is a giraffe\nIt is part of the old sign-language out of which the hieroglyphics\ndeveloped.",

        "THE history of man is the record of a hungry creature in\nsearch of food. Wherever food was plentiful, thither man has\ntravelled to make his home.",
        "The fame of the Valley of the Nile must have spread at\nan early date. From the interior of Africa and from the desert\nof Arabia and from the western part of Asia people had\nflocked to Egypt to claim their share of the rich farms.\nTogether these invaders had formed a new race which called\nitself “Remi” or “the Men” just as we sometimes call America\n\"God’s own country.” They had good reason to be grateful\nto a Fate which had carried them to this narrow strip of land.\nIn the summer of each year the Nile turned the valley into a\nshallow lake and when the waters receded all the grainfields\nand the pastures were covered with several inches of the most\nfertile clay.",
        "In Egypt a kindly river did the work of a million men and\nmade it possible to feed the teeming population of the first\nlarge cities of which we have any record. It is true that all\nthe arable land was not in the valley. But a complicated\nsystem of small canals and well-sweeps carried water from\nthe river-level to the top of the highest banks and an even\nmore intricate system of irrigation trenches spread it throughout\nthe land.",
        "While man of the prehistoric age had been obliged to spend\nsixteen hours out of every twenty-four gathering food for himself\nand the members of his tribe, the Egyptian peasant or the\ninhabitant of the Egyptian city found himself possessed of a\ncertain leisure. He used this spare time to make himself many\nthings that were merely ornamental and not in the least bit\nuseful.",
        "More than that. One day he discovered that his brain was\ncapable of thinking all kinds of thoughts which had nothing\nto do with the problems of eating and sleeping and finding a\nhome for the children. The Egyptian began to speculate upon\nmany strange problems that confronted him. Where did the\nstars come from? Who made the noise of the thunder which\nfrightened him so terribly? Who made the River Nile rise\nwith such regularity that it was possible to base the calendar\nupon the appearance and the disappearance of the annual\nfloods? Who was he, himself, a strange little creature surrounded\non all sides by death and sickness and yet happy and\nfull of laughter?",
        "He asked these many questions and certain people obligingly\nstepped forward to answer these inquiries to the best of\ntheir ability. The Egyptians called them “priests” and they\nbecame the guardians of his thoughts and gained great respect\nin the community. They were highly learned men who were\nentrusted with the sacred task of keeping the written records.\nThey understood that it is not good for man to think only of\nhis immediate advantage in this world and they drew his attention\nto the days of the future when his soul would dwell\nbeyond the mountains of the west and must give an account\nof his deeds to Osiris, the mighty God who was the Ruler of\nthe Living and the Dead and who judged the acts of men\naccording to their merits. Indeed, the priests made so much\nof that future day in the realm of Isis and Osiris that the\nEgyptians began to regard life merely as a short preparation\nfor the Hereafter and turned the teeming valley of the Nile\ninto a land devoted to the Dead.",
        "In a strange way, the Egyptians had come to believe that\nno soul could enter the realm of Osiris without the possession\nof the body which had been its place of residence in this world.\nTherefore as soon as a man was dead his relatives took his\ncorpse and had it embalmed. For weeks it was soaked in a\nsolution of natron and then it was filled with pitch. The\nPersian word for pitch was “Mumiai” and the embalmed body\nwas called a “Mummy.” It was wrapped in yards and yards\nof specially prepared linen and it was placed in a specially\nprepared coffin ready to be removed to its final home. But\nan Egyptian grave was a real home where the body was surrounded\nby pieces of furniture and musical instruments (to\nwhile away the dreary hours of waiting) and by little statues\nof cooks and bakers and barbers (that the occupant of this\ndark home might be decently provided with food and need not\ngo about unshaven).",
        "Originally these graves had been dug into the rocks of the\nwestern mountains but as the Egyptians moved northward\nthey were obliged to build their cemeteries in the desert. The\ndesert however is full of wild animals and equally wild robbers\nand they broke into the graves and disturbed the mummy or\nstole the jewelry that had been buried with the body. To prevent\nsuch unholy desecration the Egyptians used to build small\nmounds of stones on top of the graves. These little mounds\ngradually grew in size, because the rich people built higher\nmounds than the poor and there was a good deal of competition\nto see who could make the highest hill of stones. The\nrecord was made by King Khufu, whom the Greeks called\nCheops and who lived thirty centuries before our era. His\nmound, which the Greeks called a pyramid (because the\nEgyptian word for high was pir-em-us) was over five hundred\nfeet high.",

But so well did the King’s\narchitects and engineers perform their task that the narrow\npassage-way which leads to the royal tomb in the heart of the\nstone monster has never yet been pushed out of shape by the\nweight of those thousands of tons of stone which press upon\nit from all sides.",

It taught the people who lived along its\nbanks the noble art of “team-work.” They depended upon\neach other to build their irrigation trenches and keep their\ndikes in repair. In this way they learned how to get along\nwith their neighbours and their mutual-benefit-association quite\neasily developed into an organised state.",
        "Then one man grew more powerful than most of his neighbours\nand he became the leader of the community and their\ncommander-in-chief when the envious neighbours of western\nAsia invaded the prosperous valley. In due course of time\nhe became their King and ruled all the land from the Mediterranean\nto the mountains of the west.",

        "It was different however when a foreign invader came\nand robbed him of his possessions. After twenty centuries of\nindependent life, a savage Arab tribe of shepherds, called the\nHyksos, attacked Egypt and for five hundred years they were\nthe masters of the valley of the Nile. They were highly un-\npopular and great hate was also felt for the Hebrews who\ncame to the land of Goshen to find a shelter after their long\nwandering through the desert and who helped the foreign\nusurper by acting as his tax-gatherers and his civil servants.",

But in the year 525\nB.C., Cambyses, the king of the Persians, took possession of\nEgypt and in the fourth century B.C., when Persia was conquered\nby Alexander the Great, Egypt too became a Macedonian\nprovince. It regained a semblance of independence\nwhen one of Alexander’s generals set himself up as king of a\nnew Egyptian state and founded the dynasty of the Ptolemies,\nwho resided in the newly built city of Alexandria.",

Twice she\nwas successful in her attacks upon the hearts of her Roman\nconquerors. But in the year 30 B.C., Augustus, the nephew\nand heir of Caesar, landed in Alexandria. He did not share\nhis late uncle’s admiration for the lovely princess. He destroyed\nher armies, but spared her life that he might make her\nmarch in his triumph as part of the spoils of war.

But the Sumerians, the earliest\ninhabitants of Mesopotamia, who had hit upon the idea of\nscratching their words in tablets of clay, had discarded pictures\nentirely and had evolved a system of V-shaped figures which\nshowed little connection with the pictures out of which they\nhad been developed. A few examples will show you what I\nmean. In the beginning a star, when drawn with a nail into\na brick looked as follows: {illust.} This sign however was too\ncumbersome and after a short while when the meaning of\n\"heaven” was added to that of star the picture was simplified\nin this way {illust.} which made it even more of a puzzle.\nIn the same way an ox changed from {illust} into {illust.}\nand a fish changed from {illust.} into {illust.} The sun\nwas originally a plain circle {illust.} and became {illust.}\nIf we were using the Sumerian script today we would make an\n{illust.} look like {illust.}. This system of writing down our\nideas looks rather complicated but for more than thirty centuries\nit was used by the Sumerians and the Babylonians and\nthe Assyrians and the Persians and all the different races\nwhich forced their way into the fertile valley.",
        "The story of Mesopotamia is one of endless warfare and\nconquest. First the Sumerians came from the North. They\nwere a white People who had lived in the mountains. They\nhad been accustomed to worship their Gods on the tops of\nhills. After they had entered the plain they constructed artificial\nlittle hills on top of which they built their altars. They\ndid not know how to build stairs and they therefore surrounded\ntheir towers with sloping galleries. Our engineers\nhave borrowed this idea, as you may see in our big railroad\nstations where ascending galleries lead from one floor to another.\nWe may have borrowed other ideas from the Sumerians\nbut we do not know it. The Sumerians were entirely ab-\nsorbed by those races that entered the fertile valley at a later\ndate. Their towers however still stand amidst the ruins of\nMesopotamia.

A thousand years later, the Akkadians\nwere forced to submit to the rule of the Amorites, another\nSemitic desert tribe whose great King Hammurabi built himself\na magnificent palace in the holy city of Babylon and who\ngave his people a set of laws which made the Babylonian state\nthe best administered empire of the ancient world. Next the\nHittites, whom you will also meet in the Old Testament, over-\nran the Fertile Valley and destroyed whatever they could not\ncarry away. They in turn were vanquished by the followers\nof the great desert God, Ashur, who called themselves Assyrians\nand who made the city of Nineveh the center of a vast\nand terrible empire which conquered all of western Asia and\nEgypt and gathered taxes from countless subject races until\nthe end of the seventh century before the birth of Christ when\nthe Chaldeans, also a Semitic tribe, re-established Babylon and\nmade that city the most important capital of that day.\nNebuchadnezzar, the best known of their Kings, encouraged\nthe study of science, and our modern knowledge of astronomy\nand mathematics is all based upon certain first principles which\nwere discovered by the Chaldeans. In the year 538 B.C. a\ncrude tribe of Persian shepherds invaded this old land and\noverthrew the empire of the Chaldeans. Two hundred years\nlater, they in turn were overthrown by Alexander the Great,\nwho turned the Fertile Valley, the old melting-pot of so many\nSemitic races, into a Greek province.

They had wandered far and wide,\nand after many years of dreary peregrinations they had been\ngiven shelter in Egypt. For more than five centuries they\nhad dwelt among the Egyptians and when their adopted country\nhad been overrun by the Hyksos marauders (as I told\nyou in the story of Egypt) they had managed to make themselves\nuseful to the foreign invader and had been left in the\nundisturbed possession of their grazing fields. But after a\nlong war of independence the Egyptians had driven the\nHyksos out of the valley of the Nile and then the Jews had\ncome upon evil times for they had been degraded to the rank\nof common slaves and they had been forced to work on the\nroyal roads and on the Pyramids. And as the frontiers were\nguarded by the Egyptian soldiers it had been impossible for\nthe Jews to escape.",
        "After many years of suffering they were saved from their\nmiserable fate by a young Jew, called Moses, who for a long\ntime had dwelt in the desert and there had learned to appreciate\nthe simple virtues of his earliest ancestors, who had kept\naway from cities and city-life and had refused to let themselves\nbe corrupted by the ease and the luxury of a foreign\ncivilisation.",

He succeeded in evading the Egyptian\ntroops that were sent after him and led his fellow tribesmen\ninto the heart of the plain at the foot of Mount Sinai. During\nhis long and lonely life in the desert, he had learned to\nrevere the strength of the great God of the Thunder and the\nStorm, who ruled the high heavens and upon whom the shepherds\ndepended for life and light and breath. This God, one\nof the many divinities who were widely worshipped in western\nAsia, was called Jehovah, and through the teaching of Moses,\nhe became the sole Master of the Hebrew race.",
        "One day, Moses disappeared from the camp of the Jews.\nIt was whispered that he had gone away carrying two tablets\nof rough-hewn stone. That afternoon, the top of the mountain\nwas lost to sight. The darkness of a terrible storm hid it from\nthe eye of man. But when Moses returned, behold! there stood\nengraved upon the tablets the words which Jehovah had spoken\nunto the people of Israel amidst the crash of his thunder and\nthe blinding flashes of his lightning. And from that moment,\nJehovah was recognised by all the Jews as the Highest Master\nof their Fate, the only True God, who had taught them how\nto live holy lives when he bade them to follow the wise lessons\nof his Ten Commandments.",
        "They followed Moses when he bade them continue their\njourney through the desert. They obeyed him when he told\nthem what to eat and drink and what to avoid that they might\nkeep well in the hot climate. And finally after many years of\nwandering they came to a land which seemed pleasant and\nprosperous. It was called Palestine, which means the country\nof the “Pilistu” the Philistines, a small tribe of Cretans who\nhad settled along the coast after they had been driven away\nfrom their own island. Unfortunately, the mainland, Palestine,\nwas already inhabited by another Semitic race, called the\nCanaanites. But the Jews forced their way into the valleys\nand built themselves cities and constructed a mighty temple\nin a town which they named Jerusalem, the Home of Peace.\nAs for Moses, he was no longer the leader of his people. He\nhad been allowed to see the mountain ridges of Palestine from\nafar. Then he had closed his tired eyes for all time. He had\nworked faithfully and hard to please Jehovah.

Their ships went regularly to Greece and Italy and\nSpain and they even ventured beyond the straits of Gibraltar\nto visit the Scilly islands where they could buy tin.

Indeed\nthey were very unpleasant people and did not have a single\nfriend. Nevertheless they have rendered all coming generations\none service of the greatest possible value.

They borrowed a few\npictures from the Egyptians and they simplified a number of\nthe wedge-shaped figures of the Sumerians.

He liked that story\nbetter than anything else he had ever heard and he made\nup his mind, that as soon as he was big enough to leave home,\nhe would travel to Greece and “find Troy.” That he was the\nson of a poor country parson in a Mecklenburg village did\nnot bother him. He knew that he would need money but\nhe decided to gather a fortune first and do the digging afterwards.\nAs a matter of fact, he managed to get a large fortune\nwithin a very short time, and as soon as he had enough money to\nequip an expedition, he went to the northwest corner of Asia\nMinor, where he supposed that Troy had been situated.",
        "In that particular nook of old Asia Minor, stood a high\nmound covered with grainfields. According to tradition it had\nbeen the home of Priamus the king of Troy. Schliemann,\nwhose enthusiasm was somewhat greater than his knowledge,\nwasted no time in preliminary explorations. At once he began\nto dig. And he dug with such zeal and such speed that his\ntrench went straight through the heart of the city for which he\nwas looking and carried him to the ruins of another buried\ntown which was at least a thousand years older than the Troy\nof which Homer had written. Then something very interesting\noccurred. If Schliemann had found a few polished stone\nhammers and perhaps a few pieces of crude pottery, no one\nwould have been surprised. Instead of discovering such objects,\nwhich people had generally associated with the prehistoric\nmen who had lived in these regions before the coming of\nthe Greeks, Schliemann found beautiful statuettes and very\ncostly jewelry and ornamented vases of a pattern that was\nunknown to the Greeks. He ventured the suggestion that\nfully ten centuries before the great Trojan war, the coast of\nthe AEgean had been inhabited by a mysterious race of men\nwho in many ways had been the superiors of the wild Greek\ntribes who had invaded their country and had destroyed their\ncivilisation or absorbed it until it had lost all trace of originality.\nAnd this proved to be the case. In the late seventies of\nthe last century, Schliemann visited the ruins of Mycenae, ruins\nwhich were so old that Roman guide-books marvelled at their\nantiquity. There again, beneath the flat slabs of stone of a\nsmall round enclosure, Schliemann stumbled upon a wonderful\ntreasure-trove, which had been left behind by those mysterious\npeople who had covered the Greek coast with their cities and\nwho had built walls, so big and so heavy and so strong, that\nthe Greeks called them the work of the Titans, those god-like\ngiants who in very olden days had used to play ball with\nmountain peaks.",
        "A very careful study of these many relics has done away\nwith some of the romantic features of the story. The makers\nof these early works of art and the builders of these strong\nfortresses were no sorcerers, but simple sailors and traders.\nThey had lived in Crete, and on the many small islands of the\nAEgean Sea. They had been hardy mariners and they had\nturned the AEgean into a center of commerce for the exchange\nof goods between the highly civilised east and the slowly\ndeveloping wilderness of the European mainland.",
        "For more than a thousand years they had maintained an\nisland empire which had developed a very high form of art.\nIndeed their most important city, Cnossus, on the northern\ncoast of Crete, had been entirely modern in its insistence upon\nhygiene and comfort. The palace had been properly drained\nand the houses had been provided with stoves and the Cnossians\nhad been the first people to make a daily use of the hitherto\nunknown bathtub. The palace of their King had been famous\nfor its winding staircases and its large banqueting hall. The\ncellars underneath this palace, where the wine and the grain\nand the olive-oil were stored, had been so vast and had so\ngreatly impressed the first Greek visitors, that they had given\nrise to the story of the “labyrinth,” the name which we give\nto a structure with so many complicated passages that it is\nalmost impossible to find our way out, once the front door has\nclosed upon our frightened selves.",
        "But what finally became of this great AEgean Empire and\nwhat caused its sudden downfall, that I can not tell.",
        "The Cretans were familiar with the art of writing, but no\none has yet been able to decipher their inscriptions. Their\nhistory therefore is unknown to us. We have to reconstruct\nthe record of their adventures from the ruins which the\nAEgeans have left behind. These ruins make it clear that the\nAEgean world was suddenly conquered by a less civilised race\nwhich had recently come from the plains of northern Europe.\nUnless we are very much mistaken, the savages who were\nresponsible for the destruction of the Cretan and the AEgean\ncivilisation were none other than certain tribes of wandering\nshepherds who had just taken possession of the rocky peninsula\nbetween the Adriatic and the AEgean seas and who are\nknown to us as Greeks.",
        "MEANWHILE THE INDO-EUROPEAN TRIBE\nOF THE HELLENES WAS TAKING\nPOSSESSION OF GREECE",
        "THE Pyramids were a thousand years old and were beginning\nto show the first signs of decay, and Hammurabi, the\nwise king of Babylon, had been dead and buried several centuries,\nwhen a small tribe of shepherds left their homes along\nthe banks of the River Danube and wandered southward in\nsearch of fresh pastures. They called themselves Hellenes,\nafter Hellen, the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha. According\nto the old myths these were the only two human beings who\nhad escaped the great flood, which countless years before had\ndestroyed all the people of the world, when they had grown\nso wicked that they disgusted Zeus, the mighty God, who lived\non Mount Olympus.",
        "Of these early Hellenes we know nothing. Thucydides,\nthe historian of the fall of Athens, describing his earliest\nancestors, said that they “did not amount to very much,” and\nthis was probably true. They were very ill-mannered. They\nlived like pigs and threw the bodies of their enemies to the wild\ndogs who guarded their sheep. They had very little respect\nfor other people’s rights, and they killed the natives of the\nGreek peninsula (who were called the Pelasgians) and stole\ntheir farms and took their cattle and made their wives and\ndaughters slaves and wrote endless songs praising the courage\nof the clan of the Achaeans, who had led the Hellenic advance-\nguard into the mountains of Thessaly and the Peloponnesus.",
        "But here and there, on the tops of high rocks, they saw\nthe castles of the AEgeans and those they did not attack for\nthey feared the metal swords and the spears of the AEgean\nsoldiers and knew that they could not hope to defeat them with\ntheir clumsy stone axes.",
        "For many centuries they continued to wander from valley\nto valley and from mountain side to mountain side Then the\nwhole of the land had been occupied and the migration had\ncome to an end.",
        "That moment was the beginning of Greek civilisation. The\nGreek farmer, living within sight of the AEgean colonies,\nwas finally driven by curiosity to visit his haughty neighbours.\nHe discovered that he could learn many useful things from\nthe men who dwelt behind the high stone walls of Mycenae, and\nTiryns.",
        "He was a clever pupil. Within a short time he mastered\nthe art of handling those strange iron weapons which the\nAEgeans had brought from Babylon and from Thebes. He\ncame to understand the mysteries of navigation. He began\nto build little boats for his own use.",
        "And when he had learned everything the AEgeans could\nteach him he turned upon his teachers and drove them back\nto their islands. Soon afterwards he ventured forth upon the\nsea and conquered all the cities of the AEgean. Finally in the\nfifteenth century before our era he plundered and ravaged\nCnossus and ten centuries after their first appearance upon\nthe scene the Hellenes were the undisputed rulers of Greece,\nof the AEgean and of the coastal regions of Asia Minor. Troy,\nthe last great commercial stronghold of the older civilisation,\nwas destroyed in the eleventh century B.C. European history\nwas to begin in all seriousness.",
        "THE GREEK CITIES THAT WERE REALLY\nSTATES",
        "WE modern people love the sound of the word “big.” We\npride ourselves upon the fact that we belong to the “biggest\"\ncountry in the world and possess the “biggest” navy and grow\nthe “biggest” oranges and potatoes, and we love to live in\ncities of “millions” of inhabitants and when we are dead we\nare buried in the “biggest cemetery of the whole state.”",
        "A citizen of ancient Greece, could he have heard us talk,\nwould not have known what we meant. “Moderation in all\nthings” was the ideal of his life and mere bulk did not impress\nhim at all. And this love of moderation was not merely a\nhollow phrase used upon special occasions: it influenced the\nlife of the Greeks from the day of their birth to the hour of\ntheir death. It was part of their literature and it made them\nbuild small but perfect temples. It found expression in the\nclothes which the men wore and in the rings and the bracelets\nof their wives. It followed the crowds that went to the theatre\nand made them hoot down any playwright who dared to\nsin against the iron law of good taste or good sense.",
        "The Greeks even insisted upon this quality in their politicians\nand in their most popular athletes. When a powerful\nrunner came to Sparta and boasted that he could stand longer\non one foot than any other man in Hellas the people drove him\nfrom the city because he prided himself upon an accomplish-\nment at which he could be beaten by any common goose.\n\"That is all very well,” you will say, “and no doubt it is a\ngreat virtue to care so much for moderation and perfection,\nbut why should the Greeks have been the only people to develop\nthis quality in olden times?” For an answer I shall\npoint to the way in which the Greeks lived.",
        "The people of Egypt or Mesopotamia had been the “subjects\"\nof a mysterious Supreme Ruler who lived miles and\nmiles away in a dark palace and who was rarely seen by the\nmasses of the population. The Greeks on the other hand,\nwere “free citizens” of a hundred independent little “cities\"\nthe largest of which counted fewer inhabitants than a large\nmodern village. When a peasant who lived in Ur said that he\nwas a Babylonian he meant that he was one of millions of\nother people who paid tribute to the king who at that particular\nmoment happened to be master of western Asia. But when\na Greek said proudly that he was an Athenian or a Theban\nhe spoke of a small town, which was both his home and his\ncountry and which recognised no master but the will of the\npeople in the market-place.",
        "To the Greek, his fatherland was the place where he was\nborn; where he had spent his earliest years playing hide and\nseek amidst the forbidden rocks of the Acropolis; where he had\ngrown into manhood with a thousand other boys and girls,\nwhose nicknames were as familiar to him as those of your own\nschoolmates. His Fatherland was the holy soil where his father\nand mother lay buried. It was the small house within the high\ncity-walls where his wife and children lived in safety. It was\na complete world which covered no more than four or five\nacres of rocky land. Don’t you see how these surroundings\nmust have influenced a man in everything he did and said and\nthought? The people of Babylon and Assyria and Egypt\nhad been part of a vast mob. They had been lost in the multitude.\nThe Greek on the other hand had never lost touch with\nhis immediate surroundings. He never ceased to be part of a\nlittle town where everybody knew every one else. He felt\nthat his intelligent neighbours were watching him. Whatever\nhe did, whether he wrote plays or made statues out of marble\nor composed songs, he remembered that his efforts were going\nto be judged by all the free-born citizens of his home-town who\nknew about such things. This knowledge forced him to strive\nafter perfection, and perfection, as he had been taught from\nchildhood, was not possible without moderation.",
        "In this hard school, the Greeks learned to excel in many\nthings. They created new forms of government and new forms\nof literature and new ideals in art which we have never been\nable to surpass. They performed these miracles in little villages\nthat covered less ground than four or five modern city\nblocks.",
        "And look, what finally happened!",
        "In the fourth century before our era, Alexander of Macedonia\nconquered the world. As soon as he had done with\nfighting, Alexander decided that he must bestow the benefits\nof the true Greek genius upon all mankind. He took it away\nfrom the little cities and the little villages and tried to make\nit blossom and bear fruit amidst the vast royal residences of\nhis newly acquired Empire. But the Greeks, removed from\nthe familiar sight of their own temples, removed from the well-\nknown sounds and smells of their own crooked streets, at once\nlost the cheerful joy and the marvellous sense of moderation\nwhich had inspired the work of their hands and brains while\nthey laboured for the glory of their old city-states. They became\ncheap artisans, content with second-rate work. The day\nthe little city-states of old Hellas lost their independence and\nwere forced to become part of a big nation, the old Greek spirit\ndied. And it has been dead ever since.",
        "THE GREEKS WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO\nTRY THE DIFFICULT EXPERIMENT OF\nSELF-GOVERNMENT",
        "IN the beginning, all the Greeks had been equally rich and\nequally poor. Every man had owned a certain number of\ncows and sheep. His mud-hut had been his castle. He had\nbeen free to come and go as he wished. Whenever it was necessary\nto discuss matters of public importance, all the citizens\nhad gathered in the market-place. One of the older men of the\nvillage was elected chairman and it was his duty to see that\neverybody had a chance to express his views. In case of war,\na particularly energetic and self-confident villager was chosen\ncommander-in-chief, but the same people who had voluntarily\ngiven this man the right to be their leader, claimed an equal\nright to deprive him of his job, once the danger had been\naverted.",
        "But gradually the village had grown into a city. Some\npeople had worked hard and others had been lazy. A few\nhad been unlucky and still others had been just plain dishonest\nin dealing with their neighbours and had gathered wealth.\nAs a result, the city no longer consisted of a number of men\nwho were equally well-off. On the contrary it was inhabited\nby a small class of very rich people and a large class of very\npoor ones.",
        "There had been another change. The old commander-in-\nchief who had been willingly recognised as “headman” or\n\"King” because he knew how to lead his men to victory, had\ndisappeared from the scene. His place had been taken by the\nnobles–a class of rich people who during the course of time\nhad got hold of an undue share of the farms and estates.",
        "These nobles enjoyed many advantages over the common\ncrowd of freemen. They were able to buy the best weapons\nwhich were to be found on the market of the eastern Mediterranean.\nThey had much spare time in which they could prac-\ntise the art of fighting. They lived in strongly built houses\nand they could hire soldiers to fight for them. They were\nconstantly quarrelling among each other to decide who should\nrule the city. The victorious nobleman then assumed a sort of\nKingship over all his neighbours and governed the town until\nhe in turn was killed or driven away by still another ambitious\nnobleman.",
        "Such a King, by the grace of his soldiers, was called a\n\"Tyrant” and during the seventh and sixth centuries before\nour era every Greek city was for a time ruled by such Tyrants,\nmany of whom, by the way, happened to be exceedingly capa-\nble men. But in the long run, this state of affairs became\nunbearable. Then attempts were made to bring about reforms\nand out of these reforms grew the first democratic government\nof which the world has a record.",
        "It was early in the seventh century that the people of\nAthens decided to do some housecleaning and give the large\nnumber of freemen once more a voice in the government as\nthey were supposed to have had in the days of their Achaean\nancestors. They asked a man by the name of Draco to provide\nthem with a set of laws that would protect the poor against\nthe aggressions of the rich. Draco set to work. Unfortunately\nhe was a professional lawyer and very much out of touch\nwith ordinary life. In his eyes a crime was a crime and when\nhe had finished his code, the people of Athens discovered that\nthese Draconian laws were so severe that they could not\npossibly be put into effect. There would not have been rope\nenough to hang all the criminals under their new system of\njurisprudence which made the stealing of an apple a capital\noffence.",
        "The Athenians looked about for a more humane reformer.\nAt last they found some one who could do that sort of thing\nbetter than anybody else. His name was Solon. He belonged\nto a noble family and he had travelled all over the world and\nhad studied the forms of government of many other countries.\nAfter a careful study of the subject, Solon gave Athens a set\nof laws which bore testimony to that wonderful principle of\nmoderation which was part of the Greek character. He tried\nto improve the condition of the peasant without however destroying\nthe prosperity of the nobles who were (or rather who\ncould be) of such great service to the state as soldiers. To protect\nthe poorer classes against abuse on the part of the judges\n(who were always elected from the class of the nobles because\nthey received no salary) Solon made a provision whereby a\ncitizen with a grievance had the right to state his case before\na jury of thirty of his fellow Athenians.",
        "Most important of all, Solon forced the average freeman\nto take a direct and personal interest in the affairs of the city.\nNo longer could he stay at home and say “oh, I am too busy\ntoday” or “it is raining and I had better stay indoors.” He\nwas expected to do his share; to be at the meeting of the town\ncouncil; and carry part of the responsibility for the safety and\nthe prosperity of the state.",
        "This government by the “demos,” the people, was often far\nfrom successful. There was too much idle talk. There were\ntoo many hateful and spiteful scenes between rivals for official\nhonor. But it taught the Greek people to be independent and\nto rely upon themselves for their salvation and that was a very\ngood thing.",
        "HOW THE GREEKS LIVED",
        "BUT how, you will ask, did the ancient Greeks have time\nto look after their families and their business if they were\nforever running to the market-place to discuss affairs of state?\nIn this chapter I shall tell you.",
        "In all matters of government, the Greek democracy recognised\nonly one class of citizens–the freemen. Every Greek\ncity was composed of a small number of free born citizens, a\nlarge number of slaves and a sprinkling of foreigners.",
        "At rare intervals (usually during a war, when men were\nneeded for the army) the Greeks showed themselves willing to\nconfer the rights of citizenship upon the “barbarians” as they\ncalled the foreigners. But this was an exception. Citizenship\nwas a matter of birth. You were an Athenian because your\nfather and your grandfather had been Athenians before you.\nBut however great your merits as a trader or a soldier, if you\nwere born of non-Athenian parents, you remained a “foreigner\"\nuntil the end of time.",
        "The Greek city, therefore, whenever it was not ruled by a\nking or a tyrant, was run by and for the freemen, and this\nwould not have been possible without a large army of slaves\nwho outnumbered the free citizens at the rate of six or five\nto one and who performed those tasks to which we modern\npeople must devote most of our time and energy if we wish to\nprovide for our families and pay the rent of our apartments.\nThe slaves did all the cooking and baking and candlestick\nmaking of the entire city. They were the tailors and the carpenters\nand the jewelers and the school-teachers and the bookkeepers\nand they tended the store and looked after the factory\nwhile the master went to the public meeting to discuss questions\nof war and peace or visited the theatre to see the latest\nplay of AEschylus or hear a discussion of the revolutionary ideas\nof Euripides, who had dared to express certain doubts upon\nthe omnipotence of the great god Zeus.",
        "Indeed, ancient Athens resembled a modem club. All the\nfreeborn citizens were hereditary members and all the slaves\nwere hereditary servants, and waited upon the needs of their\nmasters, and it was very pleasant to be a member of the\norganisation.",
        "But when we talk about slaves. we do not mean the sort of\npeople about whom you have read in the pages of “Uncle\nTom’s Cabin.” It is true that the position of those slaves who\ntilled the fields was a very unpleasant one, but the average\nfreeman who had come down in the world and who had been\nobliged to hire himself out as a farm hand led just as miserable\na life. In the cities, furthermore, many of the slaves were\nmore prosperous than the poorer classes of the freemen. For\nthe Greeks, who loved moderation in all things, did not like to\ntreat their slaves after the fashion which afterward was so\ncommon in Rome, where a slave had as few rights as an engine\nin a modern factory and could be thrown to the wild animals\nupon the smallest pretext.",
        "The Greeks accepted slavery as a necessary institution,\nwithout which no city could possibly become the home of a truly\ncivilised people.",
        "The slaves also took care of those tasks which nowadays are\nperformed by the business men and the professional men. As\nfor those household duties which take up so much of the time\nof your mother and which worry your father when he comes\nhome from his office, the Greeks, who understood the value of\nleisure, had reduced such duties to the smallest possible minimum\nby living amidst surroundings of extreme simplicity.",
        "To begin with, their homes were very plain. Even the rich\nnobles spent their lives in a sort of adobe barn, which lacked\nall the comforts which a modern workman expects as his natural\nright. A Greek home consisted of four walls and a roof.\nThere was a door which led into the street but there were no\nwindows. The kitchen, the living rooms and the sleeping quarters\nwere built around an open courtyard in which there was a\nsmall fountain, or a statue and a few plants to make it look\nbright. Within this courtyard the family lived when it did not\nrain or when it was not too cold. In one corner of the yard the\ncook (who was a slave) prepared the meal and in another\ncorner, the teacher (who was also a slave) taught the children\nthe alpha beta gamma and the tables of multiplication and in\nstill another corner the lady of the house, who rarely left her\ndomain (since it was not considered good form for a married\nwoman to be seen on the street too often) was repairing her\nhusband’s coat with her seamstresses (who were slaves,) and\nin the little office, right off the door, the master was inspecting\nthe accounts which the overseer of his farm (who was a slave)\nhad just brought to him.",
        "When dinner was ready the family came together but the\nmeal was a very simple one and did not take much time. The\nGreeks seem to have regarded eating as an unavoidable evil\nand not a pastime, which kills many dreary hours and eventually\nkills many dreary people. They lived on bread and on\nwine, with a little meat and some green vegetables. They\ndrank water only when nothing else was available because\nthey did not think it very healthy. They loved to call on each\nother for dinner, but our idea of a festive meal, where everybody\nis supposed to eat much more than is good for him, would\nhave disgusted them. They came together at the table for\nthe purpose of a good talk and a good glass of wine and water,\nbut as they were moderate people they despised those who\ndrank too much.",
        "The same simplicity which prevailed in the dining room\nalso dominated their choice of clothes. They liked to be clean\nand well groomed, to have their hair and beards neatly cut,\nto feel their bodies strong with the exercise and the swimming\nof the gymnasium, but they never followed the Asiatic fashion\nwhich prescribed loud colours and strange patterns. They\nwore a long white coat and they managed to look as smart as\na modern Italian officer in his long blue cape.",
        "They loved to see their wives wear ornaments but they\nthought it very vulgar to display their wealth (or their wives)\nin public and whenever the women left their home they were as\ninconspicuous as possible.",
        "In short, the story of Greek life is a story not only of moderation\nbut also of simplicity. “Things,” chairs and tables and\nbooks and houses and carriages, are apt to take up a great\ndeal of their owner’s time. In the end they invariably make\nhim their slave and his hours are spent looking after their\nwants, keeping them polished and brushed and painted. The\nGreeks, before everything else, wanted to be “free,” both in\nmind and in body. That they might maintain their liberty, and\nbe truly free in spirit, they reduced their daily needs to the\nlowest possible point.",
        "THE ORIGINS OF THE THEATRE, THE FIRST\nFORM OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT",
        "AT a very early stage of their history the Greeks had begun\nto collect the poems, which had been written in honor of\ntheir brave ancestors who had driven the Pelasgians out of\nHellas and had destroyed the power of Troy. These poems were\nrecited in public and everybody came to listen to them. But\nthe theatre, the form of entertainment which has become almost\na necessary part of our own lives, did not grow out of these\nrecited heroic tales. It had such a curious origin that I must\ntell you something about it in a separate chapter",
        "The Greeks had always been fond of parades. Every\nyear they held solemn processions in honor of Dionysos the\nGod of the wine. As everybody in Greece drank wine (the\nGreeks thought water only useful for the purpose of swimming\nand sailing) this particular Divinity was as popular as a God\nof the Soda-Fountain would be in our own land.",
        "And because the Wine-God was supposed to live in the\nvineyards, amidst a merry mob of Satyrs (strange creatures\nwho were half man and half goat), the crowd that joined the\nprocession used to wear goat-skins and to hee-haw like real\nbilly-goats. The Greek word for goat is “tragos” and the\nGreek word for singer is “oidos.” The singer who meh-mehed\nlike a goat therefore was called a “tragos-oidos” or goat singer,\nand it is this strange name which developed into the modern\nword “Tragedy,” which means in the theatrical sense a piece\nwith an unhappy ending, just as Comedy (which really means\nthe singing of something “comos” or gay) is the name given\nto a play which ends happily.",
        "But how, you will ask, did this noisy chorus of masqueraders,\nstamping around like wild goats, ever develop into the\nnoble tragedies which have filled the theatres of the world for\nalmost two thousand years?",
        "The connecting link between the goat-singer and Hamlet is\nreally very simple as I shall show you in a moment.",
        "The singing chorus was very amusing in the beginning and\nattracted large crowds of spectators who stood along the side\nof the road and laughed. But soon this business of tree-hawing\ngrew tiresome and the Greeks thought dullness an evil only\ncomparable to ugliness or sickness. They asked for something\nmore entertaining. Then an inventive young poet from\nthe village of Icaria in Attica hit upon a new idea which proved\na tremendous success. He made one of the members of the\ngoat-chorus step forward and engage in conversation with the\nleader of the musicians who marched at the head of the parade\nplaying upon their pipes of Pan. This individual was allowed\nto step out of line. He waved his arms and gesticulated\nwhile he spoke (that is to say he “acted” while the others merely\nstood by and sang) and he asked a lot of questions, which the\nbandmaster answered according to the roll of papyrus upon\nwhich the poet had written down these answers before the\nshow began.",
        "This rough and ready conversation–the dialogue–which\ntold the story of Dionysos or one of the other Gods, became\nat once popular with the crowd. Henceforth every Dionysian\nprocession had an “acted scene” and very soon the “acting\"\nwas considered more important than the procession and the\nmeh-mehing.",
        "AEschylus, the most successful of all “tragedians” who wrote\nno less than eighty plays during his long life (from 526 to 455)\nmade a bold step forward when he introduced two “actors\"\ninstead of one. A generation later Sophocles increased the\nnumber of actors to three. When Euripides began to write\nhis terrible tragedies in the middle of the fifth century, B.C.,\nhe was allowed as many actors as he liked and when Aristophanes\nwrote those famous comedies in which he poked fun at\neverybody and everything, including the Gods of Mount Olympus,\nthe chorus had been reduced to the role of mere bystanders\nwho were lined up behind the principal performers\nand who sang “this is a terrible world” while the hero in the\nforeground committed a crime against the will of the Gods.",
        "This new form of dramatic entertainment demanded a\nproper setting, and soon every Greek city owned a theatre, cut\nout of the rock of a nearby hill. The spectators sat upon\nwooden benches and faced a wide circle (our present orchestra\nwhere you pay three dollars and thirty cents for a seat).\nUpon this half-circle, which was the stage, the actors and the\nchorus took their stand. Behind them there was a tent where\nthey made up with large clay masks which hid their faces and\nwhich showed the spectators whether the actors were supposed\nto be happy and smiling or unhappy and weeping. The Greek\nword for tent is “skene” and that is the reason why we talk\nof the “scenery” of the stage.",
        "When once the tragedy had become part of Greek life, the\npeople took it very seriously and never went to the theatre to\ngive their minds a vacation. A new play became as important\nan event as an election and a successful playwright was\nreceived with greater honors than those bestowed upon a general\nwho had just returned from a famous victory.",
        "HOW THE GREEKS DEFENDED EUROPE\nAGAINST ASIATIC INVASION AND DROVE\nTHE PERSIANS BACK ACROSS THE AEGEAN\nSEA",
        "THE Greeks had learned the art of trading from the\nAEgeans who had been the pupils of the Phoenicians. They\nhad founded colonies after the Phoenician pattern. They had\neven improved upon the Phoenician methods by a more general\nuse of money in dealing with foreign customers. In the sixth\ncentury before our era they had established themselves firmly\nalong the coast of Asia Minor and they were taking away\ntrade from the Phoenicians at a fast rate. This the Phoenicians\nof course did not like but they were not strong enough to\nrisk a war with their Greek competitors. They sat and waited\nnor did they wait in vain.",
        "In a former chapter, I have told you how a humble tribe\nof Persian shepherds had suddenly gone upon the warpath and\nhad conquered the greater part of western Asia. The Persians\nwere too civilised to plunder their new subjects. They\ncontented themselves with a yearly tribute. When they\nreached the coast of Asia Minor they insisted that the Greek\ncolonies of Lydia recognize the Persian Kings as their over-\nLords and pay them a stipulated tax. The Greek colonies\nobjected. The Persians insisted. Then the Greek colonies\nappealed to the home-country and the stage was set for a\nquarrel.",
        "For if the truth be told, the Persian Kings regarded the\nGreek city-states as very dangerous political institutions and\nbad examples for all other people who were supposed to be the\npatient slaves of the mighty Persian Kings.",
        "Of course, the Greeks enjoyed a certain degree of safety because\ntheir country lay hidden beyond the deep waters of the\nAEgean. But here their old enemies, the Phoenicians, stepped\nforward with offers of help and advice to the Persians. If the\nPersian King would provide the soldiers, the Phoenicians would\nguarantee to deliver the necessary ships to carry them to\nEurope. It was the year 492 before the birth of Christ, and\nAsia made ready to destroy the rising power of Europe.",
        "As a final warning the King of Persia sent messengers\nto the Greeks asking for “earth and water” as a token of their\nsubmission. The Greeks promptly threw the messengers into\nthe nearest well where they would find both “earth and water\"\nin large abundance and thereafter of course peace was impossible.",
        "But the Gods of High Olympus watched over their children\nand when the Phoenician fleet carrying the Persian troops\nwas near Mount Athos, the Storm-God blew his cheeks until\nhe almost burst the veins of his brow, and the fleet was destroyed\nby a terrible hurricane and the Persians were all\ndrowned.",
        "Two years later they returned. This time they sailed\nstraight across the AEgean Sea and landed near the village of\nMarathon. As soon as the Athenians heard this they sent\ntheir army of ten thousand men to guard the hills that\nsurrounded the Marathonian plain. At the same time they\ndespatched a fast runner to Sparta to ask for help. But Sparta\nwas envious of the fame of Athens and refused to come to her\nassistance. The other Greek cities followed her example with\nthe exception of tiny Plataea which sent a thousand men. On\nthe twelfth of September of the year 490, Miltiades, the Athenian\ncommander, threw this little army against the hordes of the\nPersians. The Greeks broke through the Persian barrage of\narrows and their spears caused terrible havoc among the disorganised\nAsiatic troops who had never been called upon to resist\nsuch an enemy.",
        "That night the people of Athens watched the sky grow\nred with the flames of burning ships. Anxiously they waited\nfor news. At last a little cloud of dust appeared upon the\nroad that led to the North. It was Pheidippides, the runner.\nHe stumbled and gasped for his end was near. Only a few\ndays before had he returned from his errand to Sparta. He\nhad hastened to join Miltiades. That morning he had taken\npart in the attack and later he had volunteered to carry the\nnews of victory to his beloved city. The people saw him fall\nand they rushed forward to support him. “We have won,\"\nhe whispered and then he died, a glorious death which made him\nenvied of all men.",
        "As for the Persians, they tried, after this defeat, to land\nnear Athens but they found the coast guarded and disappeared,\nand once more the land of Hellas was at peace.",
        "Eight years they waited and during this time the Greeks\nwere not idle. They knew that a final attack was to be expected\nbut they did not agree upon the best way to avert the danger.\nSome people wanted to increase the army. Others said that\na strong fleet was necessary for success. The two parties led by\nAristides (for the army) and Themistocles (the leader of the\nbigger-navy men) fought each other bitterly and nothing was\ndone until Aristides was exiled. Then Themistocles had his\nchance and he built all the ships he could and turned the Piraeus\ninto a strong naval base.",
        "In the year 481 B.C. a tremendous Persian army appeared\nin Thessaly, a province of northern Greece. In this hour of\ndanger, Sparta, the great military city of Greece, was elected\ncommander-in-chief. But the Spartans cared little what happened\nto northern Greece provided their own country was not\ninvaded, They neglected to fortify the passes that led into\nGreece.",
        "A small detachment of Spartans under Leonidas had been\ntold to guard the narrow road between the high mountains and\nthe sea which connected Thessaly with the southern provinces.\nLeonidas obeyed his orders. He fought and held the pass with\nunequalled bravery. But a traitor by the name of Ephialtes\nwho knew the little byways of Malis guided a regiment of Persians\nthrough the hills and made it possible for them to attack\nLeonidas in the rear. Near the Warm Wells–the Thermopylae\n–a terrible battle was fought.",
        "When night came Leonidas and his faithful soldiers lay dead\nunder the corpses of their enemies.",
        "But the pass had been lost and the greater part of Greece\nfell into the hands of the Persians. They marched upon\nAthens, threw the garrison from the rocks of the Acropolis and\nburned the city. The people fled to the Island of Salamis. All\nseemed lost. But on the 20th of September of the year 480\nThemistocles forced the Persian fleet to give battle within the\nnarrow straits which separated the Island of Salamis from the\nmainland and within a few hours he destroyed three quarters\nof the Persian ships.",
        "In this way the victory of Thermopylae came to naught.\nXerxes was forced to retire. The next year, so he decreed,\nwould bring a final decision. He took his troops to Thessaly\nand there he waited for spring.",
        "But this time the Spartans understood the seriousness of\nthe hour. They left the safe shelter of the wall which they had\nbuilt across the isthmus of Corinth and under the leadership\nof Pausanias they marched against Mardonius the Persian\ngeneral. The united Greeks (some one hundred thousand men\nfrom a dozen different cities) attacked the three hundred thou-\nsand men of the enemy near Plataea. Once more the heavy\nGreek infantry broke through the Persian barrage of arrows.\nThe Persians were defeated, as they had been at Marathon, and\nthis time they left for good. By a strange coincidence, the\nsame day that the Greek armies won their victory near Plataea,\nthe Athenian ships destroyed the enemy’s fleet near Cape Mycale\nin Asia Minor.",
        "Thus did the first encounter between Asia and Europe end.\nAthens had covered herself with glory and Sparta had fought\nbravely and well. If these two cities had been able to come to\nan agreement, if they had been willing to forget their little\njealousies, they might have become the leaders of a strong and\nunited Hellas.",
        "But alas, they allowed the hour of victory and enthusiasm\nto slip by, and the same opportunity never returned.",
        "HOW ATHENS AND SPARTA FOUGHT A LONG\nAND DISASTROUS WAR FOR THE LEADERSHIP\nOF GREECE",
        "ATHENS and Sparta were both Greek cities and their people\nspoke a common language. In every other respect they were\ndifferent. Athens rose high from the plain. It was a city\nexposed to the fresh breezes from the sea, willing to look at\nthe world with the eyes of a happy child. Sparta, on the other\nhand, was built at the bottom of a deep valley, and used the\nsurrounding mountains as a barrier against foreign thought.\nAthens was a city of busy trade. Sparta was an armed camp\nwhere people were soldiers for the sake of being soldiers. The\npeople of Athens loved to sit in the sun and discuss poetry or\nlisten to the wise words of a philosopher. The Spartans, on the\nother hand, never wrote a single line that was considered literature,\nbut they knew how to fight, they liked to fight, and they\nsacrificed all human emotions to their ideal of military preparedness.",
        "No wonder that these sombre Spartans viewed the success\nof Athens with malicious hate. The energy which the defence of\nthe common home had developed in Athens was now used for\npurposes of a more peaceful nature. The Acropolis was rebuilt\nand was made into a marble shrine to the Goddess Athena.\nPericles, the leader of the Athenian democracy, sent far and\nwide to find famous sculptors and painters and scientists to\nmake the city more beautiful and the young Athenians more\nworthy of their home. At the same time he kept a watchful\neye on Sparta and built high walls which connected Athens\nwith the sea and made her the strongest fortress of that day.",
        "An insignificant quarrel between two little Greek cities led\nto the final conflict. For thirty years the war between Athens\nand Sparta continued. It ended in a terrible disaster for\nAthens.",
        "During the third year of the war the plague had entered\nthe city. More than half of the people and Pericles, the great\nleader, had been killed. The plague was followed by a period\nof bad and untrustworthy leadership. A brilliant young fellow\nby the name of Alcibiades had gained the favor of the\npopular assembly. He suggested a raid upon the Spartan\ncolony of Syracuse in Sicily. An expedition was equipped and\neverything was ready. But Alcibiades got mixed up in a street\nbrawl and was forced to flee. The general who succeeded him\nwas a bungler. First he lost his ships and then he lost his\narmy, and the few surviving Athenians were thrown into the\nstone-quarries of Syracuse, where they died from hunger and\nthirst.",
        "The expedition had killed all the young men of Athens.\nThe city was doomed. After a long siege the town surrendered\nin April of the year 404. The high walls were demolished.\nThe navy was taken away by the Spartans. Athens ceased to\nexist as the center of the great colonial empire which it had\nconquered during the days of its prosperity. But that wonderful\ndesire to learn and to know and to investigate which\nhad distinguished her free citizens during the days of greatness\nand prosperity did not perish with the walls and the\nships. It continued to live. It became even more brilliant.",
        "Athens no longer shaped the destinies of the land of Greece.\nBut now, as the home of the first great university the city began\nto influence the minds of intelligent people far beyond\nthe narrow frontiers of Hellas.",
        "ALEXANDER THE MACEDONIAN ESTABLISHES\nA GREEK WORLD-EMPIRE, AND\nWHAT BECAME OF THIS HIGH AMBITION",
        "WHEN the Achaeans had left their homes along the banks of\nthe Danube to look for pastures new, they had spent some\ntime among the mountains of Macedonia. Ever since, the\nGreeks had maintained certain more or less formal relations\nwith the people of this northern country. The Macedonians\nfrom their side had kept themselves well informed about conditions\nin Greece.",
        "Now it happened, just when Sparta and Athens had finished\ntheir disastrous war for the leadership of Hellas, that\nMacedonia was ruled by an extraordinarily clever man by\nthe name of Philip. He admired the Greek spirit in letters and\nart but he despised the Greek lack of self-control in political\naffairs. It irritated him to see a perfectly good people waste its\nmen and money upon fruitless quarrels. So he settled the\ndifficulty by making himself the master of all Greece and then\nhe asked his new subjects to join him on a voyage which he\nmeant to pay to Persia in return for the visit which Xerxes\nhad paid the Greeks one hundred and fifty years before.",
        "Unfortunately Philip was murdered before he could start\nupon this well-prepared expedition. The task of avenging the\ndestruction of Athens was left to Philip’s son Alexander, the\nbeloved pupil of Aristotle, wisest of all Greek teachers.",
        "Alexander bade farewell to Europe in the spring of the\nyear 334 B.C. Seven years later he reached India. In the\nmeantime he had destroyed Phoenicia, the old rival of the Greek\nmerchants. He had conquered Egypt and had been worshipped\nby the people of the Nile valley as the son and heir of the\nPharaohs. He had defeated the last Persian king–he had\noverthrown the Persian empire he had given orders to rebuild\nBabylon–he had led his troops into the heart of the\nHimalayan mountains and had made the entire world a Macedonian\nprovince and dependency. Then he stopped and announced\neven more ambitious plans.",
        "The newly formed Empire must be brought under the influence\nof the Greek mind. The people must be taught the Greek\nlanguage–they must live in cities built after a Greek model.\nThe Alexandrian soldier now turned school-master. The military\ncamps of yesterday became the peaceful centres of the\nnewly imported Greek civilisation. Higher and higher did the\nflood of Greek manners and Greek customs rise, when suddenly\nAlexander was stricken with a fever and died in the old\npalace of King Hammurabi of Babylon in the year 323.",
        "Then the waters receded. But they left behind the fertile clay\nof a higher civilisation and Alexander, with all his childish\nambitions and his silly vanities, had performed a most valuable\nservice. His Empire did not long survive him. A number of\nambitious generals divided the territory among themselves.\nBut they too remained faithful to the dream of a great world\nbrotherhood of Greek and Asiatic ideas and knowledge.",
        "They maintained their independence until the Romans\nadded western Asia and Egypt to their other domains. The\nstrange inheritance of this Hellenistic civilisation (part Greek,\npart Persian, part Egyptian and Babylonian) fell to the\nRoman conquerors. During the following centuries, it got\nsuch a firm hold upon the Roman world, that we feel its influence\nin our own lives this very day.",
        "A SHORT SUMMARY OF CHAPTERS 1 to 20",
        "THUS far, from the top of our high tower we have been\nlooking eastward. But from this time on, the history of Egypt\nand Mesopotamia is going to grow less interesting and I must\ntake you to study the western landscape.",
        "Before we do this, let us stop a moment and make clear to\nourselves what we have seen.",
        "First of all I showed you prehistoric man–a creature very\nsimple in his habits and very unattractive in his manners. I\ntold you how he was the most defenceless of the many animals\nthat roamed through the early wilderness of the five continents,\nbut being possessed of a larger and better brain, he managed to\nhold his own.",
        "Then came the glaciers and the many centuries of cold\nweather, and life on this planet became so difficult that man was\nobliged to think three times as hard as ever before if he wished\nto survive. Since, however, that “wish to survive” was (and is)\nthe mainspring which keeps every living being going full tilt to\nthe last gasp of its breath, the brain of glacial man was set to\nwork in all earnestness. Not only did these hardy people manage\nto exist through the long cold spells which killed many\nferocious animals, but when the earth became warm and comfortable\nonce more, prehistoric man had learned a number of\nthings which gave him such great advantages over his less intelligent\nneighbors that the danger of extinction (a very serious\none during the first half million years of man’s residence upon\nthis planet) became a very remote one.",
        "I told you how these earliest ancestors of ours were slowly\nplodding along when suddenly (and for reasons that are not\nwell understood) the people who lived in the valley of the Nile\nrushed ahead and almost over night, created the first centre of\ncivilisation.",
        "Then I showed you Mesopotamia, “the land between the\nrivers,” which was the second great school of the human race.\nAnd I made you a map of the little island bridges of the AEgean\nSea, which carried the knowledge and the science of the old\neast to the young west, where lived the Greeks.",
        "Next I told you of an Indo-European tribe, called the Hellenes,\nwho thousands of years before had left the heart of\nAsia and who had in the eleventh century before our era pushed\ntheir way into the rocky peninsula of Greece and who, since\nthen, have been known to us as the Greeks. And I told\nyou the story of the little Greek cities that were really states,\nwhere the civilisation of old Egypt and Asia was transfigured\n(that is a big word, but you can “figure out” what it means)\ninto something quite new, something that was much nobler and\nfiner than anything that had gone before.",
        "When you look at the map you will see how by this time\ncivilisation has described a semi-circle. It begins in Egypt,\nand by way of Mesopotamia and the AEgean Islands it moves\nwestward until it reaches the European continent. The first\nfour thousand years, Egyptians and Babylonians and Phoenicians\nand a large number of Semitic tribes (please remember\nthat the Jews were but one of a large number of Semitic peoples)\nhave carried the torch that was to illuminate the world.\nThey now hand it over to the Indo-European Greeks, who become\nthe teachers of another Indo-European tribe, called the\nRomans. But meanwhile the Semites have pushed westward\nalong the northern coast of Africa and have made themselves\nthe rulers of the western half of the Mediterranean just when\nthe eastern half has become a Greek (or Indo-European) possession.",
        "This, as you shall see in a moment, leads to a terrible conflict\nbetween the two rival races, and out of their struggle arises\nthe victorious Roman Empire, which is to take this Egyptian-\nMesopotamian-Greek civilisation to the furthermost corners of\nthe European continent, where it serves as the foundation upon\nwhich our modern society is based.",
        "I know all this sounds very complicated, but if you get hold\nof these few principles, the rest of our history will become a\ngreat deal simpler. The maps will make clear what the words\nfail to tell. And after this short intermission, we go back to\nour story and give you an account of the famous war between\nCarthage and Rome.",
        "THE SEMITIC COLONY OF CARTHAGE ON THE\nNORTHERN COAST OF AFRICA AND THE\nINDO-EUROPEAN CITY OF ROME ON THE\nWEST COAST OF ITALY FOUGHT EACH\nOTHER FOR THE POSSESSION OF THE\nWESTERN MEDITERRANEAN AND CARTHAGE\nWAS DESTROYED",
        "THE little Phoenician trading post of Kart-hadshat stood\non a low hill which overlooked the African Sea, a stretch of\nwater ninety miles wide which separates Africa from Europe.\nIt was an ideal spot for a commercial centre. Almost too ideal.\nIt grew too fast and became too rich. When in the sixth century\nbefore our era, Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon destroyed\nTyre, Carthage broke off all further relations with the Mother\nCountry and became an independent state–the great western\nadvance-post of the Semitic races.",
        "Unfortunately the city had inherited many of the traits\nwhich for a thousand years had been characteristic of the\nPhoenicians. It was a vast business-house, protected by a\nstrong navy, indifferent to most of the finer aspects of life.\nThe city and the surrounding country and the distant colonies\nwere all ruled by a small but exceedingly powerful group of\nrich men, The Greek word for rich is “ploutos” and the Greeks\ncalled such a government by “rich men” a “Plutocracy.” Carthage\nwas a plutocracy and the real power of the state lay in\nthe hands of a dozen big ship-owners and mine-owners and\nmerchants who met in the back room of an office and regarded\ntheir common Fatherland as a business enterprise which ought\nto yield them a decent profit. They were however wide awake\nand full of energy and worked very hard.",
        "As the years went by the influence of Carthage upon her\nneighbours increased until the greater part of the African\ncoast, Spain and certain regions of France were Carthaginian\npossessions, and paid tribute, taxes and dividends to the mighty\ncity on the African Sea.",
        "Of course, such a “plutocracy” was forever at the mercy of\nthe crowd. As long as there was plenty of work and wages\nwere high, the majority of the citizens were quite contented,\nallowed their “betters” to rule them and asked no embarrassing\nquestions. But when no ships left the harbor, when no ore\nwas brought to the smelting-ovens, when dockworkers and\nstevedores were thrown out of employment, then there were\ngrumblings and there was a demand that the popular assembly\nbe called together as in the olden days when Carthage had\nbeen a self-governing republic.",
        "To prevent such an occurrence the plutocracy was obliged\nto keep the business of the town going at full speed. They\nhad managed to do this very successfully for almost five hun-\ndred years when they were greatly disturbed by certain rumors\nwhich reached them from the western coast of Italy. It was\nsaid that a little village on the banks of the Tiber had suddenly\nrisen to great power and was making itself the acknowledged\nleader of all the Latin tribes who inhabited central Italy.\nIt was also said that this village, which by the way was called\nRome, intended to build ships and go after the commerce of\nSicily and the southern coast of France.",
        "Carthage could not possibly tolerate such competition. The\nyoung rival must be destroyed lest the Carthaginian rulers\nlose their prestige as the absolute rulers of the western\nMediterranean. The rumors were duly investigated and in a\ngeneral way these were the facts that came to light.",
        "The west coast of Italy had long been neglected by civilisation.\nWhereas in Greece all the good harbours faced eastward\nand enjoyed a full view of the busy islands of the AEgean,\nthe west coast of Italy contemplated nothing more exciting\nthan the desolate waves of the Mediterranean. The country\nwas poor. It was therefore rarely visited by foreign merchants\nand the natives were allowed to live in undisturbed possession\nof their hills and their marshy plains.",
        "The first serious invasion of this land came from the north.\nAt an unknown date certain Indo-European tribes had managed\nto find their way through the passes of the Alps and had\npushed southward until they had filled the heel and the toe of\nthe famous Italian boot with their villages and their flocks.\nOf these early conquerors we know nothing. No Homer sang\ntheir glory. Their own accounts of the foundation of Rome\n(written eight hundred years later when the little city had become\nthe centre of an Empire) are fairy stories and do not belong\nin a history. Romulus and Remus jumping across each\nother’s walls (I always forget who jumped across whose wall)\nmake entertaining reading, but the foundation of the City of\nRome was a much more prosaic affair. Rome began as a thousand\nAmerican cities have done, by being a convenient place\nfor barter and horse-trading. It lay in the heart of the plains\nof central Italy The Tiber provided direct access to the sea.\nThe land-road from north to south found here a convenient\nford which could be used all the year around. And seven little\nhills along the banks of the river offered the inhabitants a safe\nshelter against their enemies who lived in the mountains and\nthose who lived beyond the horizon of the nearby sea.",
        "The mountaineers were called the Sabines. They were a\nrough crowd with an unholy desire for easy plunder. But they\nwere very backward. They used stone axes and wooden\nshields and were no match for the Romans with their steel\nswords. The sea-people on the other hand were dangerous\nfoes. They were called the Etruscans and they were (and\nstill are) one of the great mysteries of history. Nobody knew\n(or knows) whence they came; who they were; what had driven\nthem away from their original homes. We have found the remains\nof their cities and their cemeteries and their waterworks\nall along the Italian coast. We are familiar with their inscriptions.\nBut as no one has ever been able to decipher the Etruscan\nalphabet, these written messages are, so far, merely annoying\nand not at all useful.",
        "Our best guess is that the Etruscans came originally from\nAsia Minor and that a great war or a pestilence in that country\nhad forced them to go away and seek a new home elsewhere.\nWhatever the reason for their coming, the Etruscans played a\ngreat role in history. They carried the pollen of the ancient\ncivilisation from the east to the west and they taught the\nRomans who, as we know, came from the north, the first principles\nof architecture and street-building and fighting and art\nand cookery and medicine and astronomy.",
        "But just as the Greeks had not loved their AEgean teachers,\nin this same way did the Romans hate their Etruscan masters.\nThey got rid of them as soon as they could and the opportunity\noffered itself when Greek merchants discovered the\ncommercial possibilities of Italy and when the first Greek\nvessels reached Rome. The Greeks came to trade, but they\nstayed to instruct. They found the tribes who inhabited the\nRoman country-side (and who were called the Latins) quite\nwilling to learn such things as might be of practical use. At\nonce they understood the great benefit that could be derived\nfrom a written alphabet and they copied that of the Greeks.\nThey also understood the commercial advantages of a well-\nregulated system of coins and measures and weights. Eventually\nthe Romans swallowed Greek civilisation hook, line and\nsinker.",
        "They even welcomed the Gods of the Greeks to their\ncountry. Zeus was taken to Rome where he became known as\nJupiter and the other divinities followed him. The Roman Gods\nhowever never were quite like their cheerful cousins who had\naccompanied the Greeks on their road through life and through\nhistory. The Roman Gods were State Functionaries. Each\none managed his own department with great prudence and a\ndeep sense of justice, but in turn he was exact in demanding the\nobedience of his worshippers. This obedience the Romans rendered\nwith scrupulous care. But they never established the\ncordial personal relations and that charming friendship which\nhad existed between the old Hellenes and the mighty residents\nof the high Olympian peak.",
        "The Romans did not imitate the Greek form of government,\nbut being of the same Indo-European stock as the people\nof Hellas, the early history of Rome resembles that of\nAthens and the other Greek cities. They did not find it difficult\nto get rid of their kings, the descendants of the ancient\ntribal chieftains. But once the kings had been driven from\nthe city, the Romans were forced to bridle the power of the\nnobles, and it took many centuries before they managed to\nestablish a system which gave every free citizen of Rome a\nchance to take a personal interest in the affairs of his town.",
        "Thereafter the Romans enjoyed one great advantage over\nthe Greeks. They managed the affairs of their country without\nmaking too many speeches. They were less imaginative\nthan the Greeks and they preferred an ounce of action to a\npound of words. They understood the tendency of the multi-\ntude (the “plebe,” as the assemblage of free citizens was called)\nonly too well to waste valuable time upon mere talk. They\ntherefore placed the actual business of running the city into\nthe hands of two “consuls” who were assisted by a council of\nElders, called the Senate (because the word “senex” means an\nold man). As a matter of custom and practical advantage the\nsenators were elected from the nobility. But their power had\nbeen strictly defined.",
        "Rome at one time had passed through the same sort of\nstruggle between the poor and the rich which had forced\nAthens to adopt the laws of Draco and Solon. In Rome this\nconflict had occurred in the fifth century B. C. As a result the\nfreemen had obtained a written code of laws which protected\nthem against the despotism of the aristocratic judges by the\ninstitution of the “Tribune.” These Tribunes were city-\nmagistrates, elected by the freemen. They had the right to protect\nany citizen against those actions of the government officials\nwhich were thought to be unjust. A consul had the right to\ncondemn a man to death, but if the case had not been absolutely\nproved the Tribune could interfere and save the poor\nfellow’s life.",
        "But when I use the word Rome, I seem to refer to a little\ncity of a few thousand inhabitants. And the real strength of\nRome lay in the country districts outside her walls. And it\nwas in the government of these outlying provinces that Rome\nat an early age showed her wonderful gift as a colonising\npower.",
        "In very early times Rome had been the only strongly fortified\ncity in central Italy, but it had always offered a hospitable\nrefuge to other Latin tribes who happened to be in danger of\nattack. The Latin neighbours had recognised the advantages\nof a close union with such a powerful friend and they had tried\nto find a basis for some sort of defensive and offensive alliance.\nOther nations, Egyptians, Babylonians, Phoenicians,\neven Greeks, would have insisted upon a treaty of submission\non the part of the “barbarians,” The Romans did nothing of\nthe sort. They gave the “outsider” a chance to become partners\nin a common “res publica\"–or common-wealth.",
        "“You want to join us,” they said. “Very well, go ahead\nand join. We shall treat you as if you were full-fledged citizens\nof Rome. In return for this privilege we expect you to\nfight for our city, the mother of us all, whenever it shall be\nnecessary.”",
        "The “outsider” appreciated this generosity and he showed\nhis gratitude by his unswerving loyalty.",
        "Whenever a Greek city had been attacked, the foreign\nresidents had moved out as quickly as they could. Why defend\nsomething which meant nothing to them but a temporary\nboarding house in which they were tolerated as long as they\npaid their bills? But when the enemy was before the gates\nof Rome, all the Latins rushed to her defence. It was their\nMother who was in danger. It was their true “home” even if\nthey lived a hundred miles away and had never seen the walls\nof the sacred Hills.",
        "No defeat and no disaster could change this sentiment. In\nthe beginning of the fourth century B.C. the wild Gauls forced\ntheir way into Italy. They had defeated the Roman army near\nthe River Allia and had marched upon the city. They had\ntaken Rome and then they expected that the people would\ncome and sue for peace. They waited, but nothing happened.\nAfter a short time the Gauls found themselves surrounded by\na hostile population which made it impossible for them to obtain\nsupplies. After seven months, hunger forced them to withdraw.\nThe policy of Rome to treat the “foreigner” on equal\nterms had proved a great success and Rome stood stronger than\never before.",
        "This short account of the early history of Rome shows you\nthe enormous difference between the Roman ideal of a healthy\nstate, and that of the ancient world which was embodied in the\ntown of Carthage. The Romans counted upon the cheerful\nand hearty co-operation between a number of “equal citizens.\"\nThe Carthaginians, following the example of Egypt\nand western Asia, insisted upon the unreasoning (and therefore\nunwilling) obedience of “Subjects” and when these failed\nthey hired professional soldiers to do their fighting for them.",
        "You will now understand why Carthage was bound to fear\nsuch a clever and powerful enemy and why the plutocracy of\nCarthage was only too willing to pick a quarrel that they might\ndestroy the dangerous rival before it was too late.",
        "But the Carthaginians, being good business men, knew that\nit never pays to rush matters. They proposed to the Romans\nthat their respective cities draw two circles on the map and\nthat each town claim one of these circles as her own “sphere\nof influence” and promise to keep out of the other fellow’s\ncircle. The agreement was promptly made and was broken just\nas promptly when both sides thought it wise to send their\narmies to Sicily where a rich soil and a bad government invited\nforeign interference.",
        "The war which followed (the so-called first Punic War)\nlasted twenty-four years. It was fought out on the high seas\nand in the beginning it seemed that the experienced Car-\nthaginian navy would defeat the newly created Roman fleet.\nFollowing their ancient tactics, the Carthaginian ships would\neither ram the enemy vessels or by a bold attack from the side\nthey would break their oars and would then kill the sailors of\nthe helpless vessel with their arrows and with fire balls. But\nRoman engineers invented a new craft which carried a boarding\nbridge across which the Roman infantrymen stormed the\nhostile ship. Then there was a sudden end to Carthaginian\nvictories. At the battle of Mylae their fleet was badly defeated.\nCarthage was obliged to sue for peace, and Sicily became part\nof the Roman domains.",
        "Twenty-three years later new trouble arose. Rome (in\nquest of copper) had taken the island of Sardinia. Carthage\n(in quest of silver) thereupon occupied all of southern Spain.\nThis made Carthage a direct neighbour of the Romans. The\nlatter did not like this at all and they ordered their troops to\ncross the Pyrenees and watch the Carthaginian army of occupation.",
        "The stage was set for the second outbreak between the two\nrivals. Once more a Greek colony was the pretext for a war.\nThe Carthaginians were besieging Saguntum on the east coast\nof Spain. The Saguntians appealed to Rome and Rome, as\nusual, was willing to help. The Senate promised the help of\nthe Latin armies, but the preparation for this expedition took\nsome time, and meanwhile Saguntum had been taken and had\nbeen destroyed. This had been done in direct opposition to\nthe will of Rome. The Senate decided upon war. One Roman\narmy was to cross the African sea and make a landing on Carthaginian\nsoil. A second division was to keep the Carthaginian\narmies occupied in Spain to prevent them from rushing to the\naid of the home town. It was an excellent plan and everybody\nexpected a great victory. But the Gods had decided\notherwise.",
        "It was the fall of the year 218 before the birth of Christ\nand the Roman army which was to attack the Carthaginians in\nSpain had left Italy. People were eagerly waiting for news of\nan easy and complete victory when a terrible rumour began to\nspread through the plain of the Po. Wild mountaineers, their\nlips trembling with fear, told of hundreds of thousands of\nbrown men accompanied by strange beasts “each one as big as\na house,” who had suddenly emerged from the clouds of snow\nwhich surrounded the old Graian pass through which Hercules,\nthousands of years before, had driven the oxen of Geryon on\nhis way from Spain to Greece. Soon an endless stream of\nbedraggled refugees appeared before the gates of Rome, with\nmore complete details. Hannibal, the son of Hamilcar, with\nfifty thousand soldiers, nine thousand horsemen and thirty-\nseven fighting elephants, had crossed the Pyrenees. He had\ndefeated the Roman army of Scipio on the banks of the Rhone\nand he had guided his army safely across the mountain passes\nof the Alps although it was October and the roads were thickly\ncovered with snow and ice. Then he had joined forces with\nthe Gauls and together they had defeated a second Roman\narmy just before they crossed the Trebia and laid siege to\nPlacentia, the northern terminus of the road which connected\nRome with the province of the Alpine districts.",
        "The Senate, surprised but calm and energetic as usual,\nhushed up the news of these many defeats and sent two fresh\narmies to stop the invader. Hannibal managed to surprise\nthese troops on a narrow road along the shores of the Trasimene\nLake and there he killed all the Roman officers and most\nof their men. This time there was a panic among the people\nof Rome, but the Senate kept its nerve. A third army was\norganised and the command was given to Quintus Fabius Maximus\nwith full power to act “as was necessary to save the state.”",
        "Fabius knew that he must be very careful lest all be lost.\nHis raw and untrained men, the last available soldiers, were\nno match for Hannibal’s veterans. He refused to accept battle\nbut forever he followed Hannibal, destroyed everything eatable,\ndestroyed the roads, attacked small detachments and generally\nweakened the morale of the Carthaginian troops by a\nmost distressing and annoying form of guerilla warfare.",
        "Such methods however did not satisfy the fearsome crowds\nwho had found safety behind the walls of Rome. They wanted\n\"action.” Something must be done and must be done quickly.\nA popular hero by the name of Varro, the sort of man who\nwent about the city telling everybody how much better he could\ndo things than slow old Fabius, the “Delayer,” was made\ncommander-in-chief by popular acclamation. At the battle of\nCannae (216) he suffered the most terrible defeat of Roman\nhistory. More than seventy thousand men were killed. Hannibal\nwas master of all Italy.",
        "He marched from one end of the peninsula to the other,\nproclaiming himself the “deliverer from the yoke of Rome\"\nand asking the different provinces to join him in warfare upon\nthe mother city. Then once more the wisdom of Rome bore\nnoble fruit. With the exceptions of Capua and Syracuse, all\nRoman cities remained loyal. Hannibal, the deliverer,\nfound himself opposed by the people whose friend he pretended\nto be. He was far away from home and did not like\nthe situation. He sent messengers to Carthage to ask for fresh\nsupplies and new men. Alas, Carthage could not send him\neither.",
        "The Romans with their boarding-bridges, were the masters\nof the sea. Hannibal must help himself as best he could.\nHe continued to defeat the Roman armies that were sent out\nagainst him, but his own numbers were decreasing rapidly and\nthe Italian peasants held aloof from this self-appointed\n\"deliverer.”",
        "After many years of uninterrupted victories, Hannibal\nfound himself besieged in the country which he had just\nconquered. For a moment, the luck seemed to turn. Hasdrubal,\nhis brother, had defeated the Roman armies in Spain. He had\ncrossed the Alps to come to Hannibal’s assistance. He sent\nmessengers to the south to tell of his arrival and ask the other\narmy to meet him in the plain of the Tiber. Unfortunately the\nmessengers fell into the hands of the Romans and Hannibal\nwaited in vain for further news until his brother’s head, neatly\npacked in a basket, came rolling into his camp and told him\nof the fate of the last of the Carthaginian troops.",
        "With Hasdrubal out of the way, young Publius Scipio\neasily reconquered Spain and four years later the Romans\nwere ready for a final attack upon Carthage. Hannibal was\ncalled back. He crossed the African Sea and tried to organise\nthe defences of his home-city. In the year 202 at the battle\nof Zama, the Carthaginians were defeated. Hannibal fled to\nTyre. From there he went to Asia Minor to stir up the Syrians\nand the Macedonians against Rome. He accomplished very\nlittle but his activities among these Asiatic powers gave the\nRomans an excuse to carry their warfare into the territory of\nthe east and annex the greater part of the AEgean world.",
        "Driven from one city to another, a fugitive without a home,\nHannibal at last knew that the end of his ambitious dream had\ncome. His beloved city of Carthage had been ruined by the\nwar. She had been forced to sign a terrible peace. Her navy\nhad been sunk. She had been forbidden to make war without\nRoman permission. She had been condemned to pay the Romans\nmillions of dollars for endless years to come. Life offered\nno hope of a better future. In the year 190 B.C. Hannibal took\npoison and killed himself.",
        "Forty years later, the Romans forced their last war upon\nCarthage. Three long years the inhabitants of the old Phoenician\ncolony held out against the power of the new republic.\nHunger forced them to surrender. The few men and women\nwho had survived the siege were sold as slaves. The city was\nset on fire. For two whole weeks the store-houses and the pal-\naces and the great arsenal burned. Then a terrible curse was\npronounced upon the blackened ruins and the Roman legions\nreturned to Italy to enjoy their victory.",
        "For the next thousand years, the Mediterranean remained\na European sea. But as soon as the Roman Empire had been\ndestroyed, Asia made another attempt to dominate this great\ninland sea, as you will learn when I tell you about Mohammed.",
        "HOW ROME HAPPENED",
        "THE Roman Empire was an accident. No one planned it.\nIt “happened.” No famous general or statesman or cut-\nthroat ever got up and said “Friends, Romans, Citizens, we\nmust found an Empire. Follow me and together we shall conquer\nall the land from the Gates of Hercules to Mount Taurus.”",
        "Rome produced famous generals and equally distinguished\nstatesmen and cut-throats, and Roman armies fought all over\nthe world. But the Roman empire-making was done without\na preconceived plan. The average Roman was a very matter-\nof-fact citizen. He disliked theories about government. When\nsomeone began to recite “eastward the course of Roman Empire,\netc., etc.,” he hastily left the forum. He just continued\nto take more and more land because circumstances forced him\nto do so. He was not driven by ambition or by greed. Both\nby nature and inclination he was a farmer and wanted to stay\nat home. But when he was attacked he was obliged to defend\nhimself and when the enemy happened to cross the sea to ask\nfor aid in a distant country then the patient Roman marched\nmany dreary miles to defeat this dangerous foe and when this\nhad been accomplished, he stayed behind to adminster{sic} his\nnewly conquered provinces lest they fall into the hands of\nwandering Barbarians and become themselves a menace to\nRoman safety. It sounds rather complicated and yet to the\ncontemporaries it was so very simple, as you shall see in a moment.",
        "In the year 203 B.C. Scipio had crossed the African Sea\nand had carried the war into Africa. Carthage had called Hannibal\nback. Badly supported by his mercenaries, Hannibal\nhad been defeated near Zama. The Romans had asked for his\nsurrender and Hannibal had fled to get aid from the kings of\nMacedonia and Syria, as I told you in my last chapter.",
        "The rulers of these two countries (remnants of the Empire\nof Alexander the Great) just then were contemplating an\nexpedition against Egypt. They hoped to divide the rich Nile\nvalley between themselves. The king of Egypt had heard of\nthis and he had asked Rome to come to his support. The stage\nwas set for a number of highly interesting plots and counter-\nplots. But the Romans, with their lack of imagination, rang\nthe curtain down before the play had been fairly started.\nTheir legions completely defeated the heavy Greek phalanx\nwhich was still used by the Macedonians as their battle formation.\nThat happened in the year 197 B.C. at the battle in the\nplains of Cynoscephalae, or “Dogs’ Heads,” in central Thessaly.",
        "The Romans then marched southward to Attica and informed\nthe Greeks that they had come to “deliver the Hellenes\nfrom the Macedonian yoke.” The Greeks, having learned\nnothing in their years of semi-slavery, used their new freedom\nin a most unfortunate way. All the little city-states once more\nbegan to quarrel with each other as they had done in the good\nold days. The Romans, who had little understanding and less\nlove for these silly bickerings of a race which they rather despised,\nshowed great forebearance. But tiring of these endless\ndissensions they lost patience, invaded Greece, burned down\nCorinth (to “encourage the other Greeks”) and sent a Roman\ngovernor to Athens to rule this turbulent province. In this\nway, Macedonia and Greece became buffer states which protected\nRome’s eastern frontier.",
        "Meanwhile right across the Hellespont lay the Kingdom of\nSyria, and Antiochus III, who ruled that vast land, had shown\ngreat eagerness when his distinguished guest, General Han-\nnibal, explained to him how easy it would be to invade Italy\nand sack the city of Rome.",
        "Lucius Scipio, a brother of Scipio the African fighter who\nhad defeated Hannibal and his Carthaginians at Zama, was\nsent to Asia Minor. He destroyed the armies of the Syrian\nking near Magnesia (in the year 190 B.C.) Shortly afterwards,\nAntiochus was lynched by his own people. Asia Minor\nbecame a Roman protectorate and the small City-Republic of\nRome was mistress of most of the lands which bordered upon\nthe Mediterranean.",
        "HOW THE REPUBLIC OF ROME AFTER CENTURIES\nOF UNREST AND REVOLUTION BECAME\nAN EMPIRE",
        "WHEN the Roman armies returned from these many victorious\ncampaigns, they were received with great jubilation.\nAlas and alack! this sudden glory did not make the country any\nhappier. On the contrary. The endless campaigns had ruined\nthe farmers who had been obliged to do the hard work of Empire\nmaking. It had placed too much power in the hands of the\nsuccessful generals (and their private friends) who had used\nthe war as an excuse for wholesale robbery.",
        "The old Roman Republic had been proud of the simplicity\nwhich had characterised the lives of her famous men. The\nnew Republic felt ashamed of the shabby coats and the high\nprinciples which had been fashionable in the days of its grandfathers.\nIt became a land of rich people ruled by rich people\nfor the benefit of rich people. As such it was doomed to\ndisastrous failure, as I shall now tell you.",
        "Within less than a century and a half. Rome had become\nthe mistress of practically all the land around the Mediterranean.\nIn those early days of history a prisoner of war lost\nhis freedom and became a slave. The Roman regarded war as\na very serious business and he showed no mercy to a conquered\nfoe. After the fall of Carthage, the Carthaginian women and\nchildren were sold into bondage together with their own slaves.\nAnd a like fate awaited the obstinate inhabitants of Greece and\nMacedonia and Spain and Syria when they dared to revolt\nagainst the Roman power.",
        "Two thousand years ago a slave was merely a piece of\nmachinery. Nowadays a rich man invests his money in factories.\nThe rich people of Rome (senators, generals and war-\nprofiteers) invested theirs in land and in slaves. The land\nthey bought or took in the newly-acquired provinces. The\nslaves they bought in open market wherever they happened to\nbe cheapest. During most of the third and second centuries\nbefore Christ there was a plentiful supply, and as a result the\nlandowners worked their slaves until they dropped dead in their\ntracks, when they bought new ones at the nearest bargain-counter\nof Corinthian or Carthaginian captives.",
        "And now behold the fate of the freeborn farmer!",
        "He had done his duty toward Rome and he had fought her\nbattles without complaint. But when he came home after ten,\nfifteen or twenty years, his lands were covered with weeds and\nhis family had been ruined. But he was a strong man and\nwilling to begin life anew. He sowed and planted and waited\nfor the harvest. He carried his grain to the market together\nwith his cattle and his poultry, to find that the large landowners\nwho worked their estates with slaves could underbid him all\nalong the line. For a couple of years he tried to hold his own.\nThen he gave up in despair. He left the country and he went\nto the nearest city. In the city he was as hungry as he had been\nbefore on the land. But he shared his misery with thousands\nof other disinherited beings. They crouched together in filthy\nhovels in the suburbs of the large cities. They were apt\nto get sick and die from terrible epidemics. They were all\nprofoundly discontented. They had fought for their country and\nthis was their reward. They were always willing to listen to\nthose plausible spell-binders who gather around a public\ngrievance like so many hungry vultures, and soon they became a\ngrave menace to the safety of the state.",
        "But the class of the newly-rich shrugged its shoulders.\n\"We have our army and our policemen,” they argued, “they\nwill keep the mob in order.” And they hid themselves behind\nthe high walls of their pleasant villas and cultivated their\ngardens and read the poems of a certain Homer which a Greek\nslave had just translated into very pleasing Latin hexameters.",
        "In a few families however the old tradition of unselfish\nservice to the Commonwealth continued. Cornelia, the daughter\nof Scipio Africanus, had been married to a Roman by the\nname of Gracchus. She had two sons, Tiberius and Gaius.\nWhen the boys grew up they entered politics and tried to bring\nabout certain much-needed reforms. A census had shown\nthat most of the land of the Italian peninsula was owned by\ntwo thousand noble families. Tiberius Gracchus, having been\nelected a Tribune, tried to help the freemen. He revived two\nancient laws which restricted the number of acres which a single\nowner might possess. In this way he hoped to revive the\nvaluable old class of small and independent freeholders. The\nnewly-rich called him a robber and an enemy of the state.\nThere were street riots. A party of thugs was hired to kill the\npopular Tribune. Tiberius Gracchus was attacked when he\nentered the assembly and was beaten to death. Ten years later\nhis brother Gaius tried the experiment of reforming a nation\nagainst the expressed wishes of a strong privileged class. He\npassed a “poor law” which was meant to help the destitute\nfarmers. Eventually it made the greater part of the Roman\ncitizens into professional beggars.",
        "He established colonies of destitute people in distant parts\nof the empire, but these settlements failed to attract the right\nsort of people. Before Gaius Gracchus could do more harm he\ntoo was murdered and his followers were either killed or exiled.\nThe first two reformers had been gentlemen. The two who\ncame after were of a very different stamp. They were\nprofessional soldiers. One was called Marius. The name of the\nother was Sulla. Both enjoyed a large personal following.",
        "Sulla was the leader of the landowners. Marius, the victor\nin a great battle at the foot of the Alps when the Teutons\nand the Cimbri had been annihilated, was the popular hero\nof the disinherited freemen.",
        "Now it happened in the year 88 B.C. that the Senate of\nRome was greatly disturbed by rumours that came from Asia.\nMithridates, king of a country along the shores of the Black\nSea, and a Greek on his mother’s side, had seen the possibility\nof establishing a second Alexandrian Empire. He began his\ncampaign for world-domination with the murder of all Roman\ncitizens who happened to be in Asia Minor, men, women and\nchildren. Such an act, of course, meant war. The Senate\nequipped an army to march against the King of Pontus and\npunish him for his crime. But who was to be commander-in-\nchief? “Sulla,” said the Senate, “because he is Consul.\"\n\"Marius,” said the mob, “because he has been Consul five times\nand because he is the champion of our rights.”",
        "Possession is nine points of the law. Sulla happened to be\nin actual command of the army. He went west to defeat\nMithridates and Marius fled to Africa. There he waited\nuntil he heard that Sulla had crossed into Asia. He then\nreturned to Italy, gathered a motley crew of malcontents,\nmarched on Rome and entered the city with his professional\nhighwaymen, spent five days and five nights, slaughtering the\nenemies of the Senatorial party, got himself elected Consul and\npromptly died from the excitement of the last fortnight.",
        "There followed four years of disorder. Then Sulla, having\ndefeated Mithridates, announced that he was ready to return\nto Rome and settle a few old scores of his own. He was as\ngood as his word. For weeks his soldiers were busy executing\nthose of their fellow citizens who were suspected of democratic\nsympathies. One day they got hold of a young fellow who\nhad been often seen in the company of Marius. They were\ngoing to hang him when some one interfered. “The boy is too\nyoung,” he said, and they let him go. His name was Julius\nCaesar. You shall meet him again on the next page.",
        "As for Sulla, he became “Dictator,” which meant sole and\nsupreme ruler of all the Roman possessions. He ruled Rome\nfor four years, and he died quietly in his bed, having spent the\nlast year of his life tenderly raising his cabbages, as was the\ncustom of so many Romans who had spent a lifetime killing\ntheir fellow-men.",
        "But conditions did not grow better. On the contrary, they\ngrew worse. Another general, Gnaeus Pompeius, or Pompey,\na close friend of Sulla, went east to renew the war against the\never troublesome Mithridates. He drove that energetic potentate\ninto the mountains where Mithridates took poison and\nkilled himself, well knowing what fate awaited him as a Roman\ncaptive. Next he re-established the authority of Rome over\nSyria, destroyed Jerusalem, roamed through western Asia,\ntrying to revive the myth of Alexander the Great, and at last\n(in the year 62) returned to Rome with a dozen ship-loads of\ndefeated Kings and Princes and Generals, all of whom were\nforced to march in the triumphal procession of this enormously\npopular Roman who presented his city with the sum of forty\nmillion dollars in plunder.",
        "It was necessary that the government of Rome be placed\nin the hands of a strong man. Only a few months before, the\ntown had almost fallen into the hands of a good-for-nothing\nyoung aristocrat by the name of Catiline, who had gambled\naway his money and hoped to reimburse himself for his losses by\na little plundering. Cicero, a public-spirited lawyer, had discovered\nthe plot, had warned the Senate, and had forced Catiline\nto flee. But there were other young men with similar ambitions\nand it was no time for idle talk.",
        "Pompey organised a triumvirate which was to take charge\nof affairs. He became the leader of this Vigilante Committee.\nGaius Julius Caesar, who had made a reputation for himself\nas governor of Spain, was the second in command. The\nthird was an indifferent sort of person by the name of Crassus.\nHe had been elected because he was incredibly rich, having been\na successful contractor of war supplies. He soon went upon\nan expedition against the Parthians and was killed.",
        "As for Caesar, who was by far the ablest of the three, he\ndecided that he needed a little more military glory to become\na popular hero. He crossed the Alps and conquered that part\nof the world which is now called France. Then he hammered\na solid wooden bridge across the Rhine and invaded the land\nof the wild Teutons. Finally he took ship and visited England.\nHeaven knows where he might have ended if he had not been\nforced to return to Italy. Pompey, so he was informed, had\nbeen appointed dictator for life. This of course meant that\nCaesar was to be placed on the list of the “retired officers,” and\nthe idea did not appeal to him. He remembered that he had\nbegun life as a follower of Marius. He decided to teach the\nSenators and their “dictator” another lesson. He crossed the\nRubicon River which separated the province of Cis-alpine Gaul\nfrom Italy. Everywhere he was received as the “friend of the\npeople.” Without difficulty Caesar entered Rome and Pompey\nfled to Greece Caesar followed him and defeated his followers\nnear Pharsalus. Pompey sailed across the Mediterranean and\nescaped to Egypt. When he landed he was murdered by order\nof young king Ptolemy. A few days later Caesar arrived.\nHe found himself caught in a trap. Both the Egyptians and\nthe Roman garrison which had remained faithful to Pompey,\nattacked his camp.",
        "Fortune was with Caesar. He succeeded in setting fire to\nthe Egyptian fleet. Incidentally the sparks of the burning\nvessels fell on the roof of the famous library of Alexandria\n(which was just off the water front,) and destroyed it. Next\nhe attacked the Egyptian army, drove the soldiers into the\nNile, drowned Ptolemy, and established a new government\nunder Cleopatra, the sister of the late king. Just then word\nreached him that Pharnaces, the son and heir of Mithridates,\nhad gone on the war-path. Caesar marched northward, defeated\nPharnaces in a war which lasted five days, sent word of\nhis victory to Rome in the famous sentence “veni, vidi, vici,\"\nwhich is Latin for “I came, I saw, I conquered,” and returned\nto Egypt where he fell desperately in love with Cleopatra, who\nfollowed him to Rome when he returned to take charge of the\ngovernment, in the year 46. He marched at the head of not\nless than four different victory-parades, having won four\ndifferent campaigns.",
        "Then Caesar appeared in the Senate to report upon his\nadventures, and the grateful Senate made him “dictator” for\nten years. It was a fatal step.",
        "The new dictator made serious attempts to reform the\nRoman state. He made it possible for freemen to become\nmembers of the Senate. He conferred the rights of citizenship\nupon distant communities as had been done in the early days\nof Roman history. He permitted “foreigners” to exercise\ninfluence upon the government. He reformed the administration\nof the distant provinces which certain aristocratic families\nhad come to regard as their private possessions. In short he\ndid many things for the good of the majority of the people but\nwhich made him thoroughly unpopular with the most powerful\nmen in the state. Half a hundred young aristocrats formed a\nplot “to save the Republic.” On the Ides of March (the fifteenth\nof March according to that new calendar which Caesar\nhad brought with him from Egypt) Caesar was murdered when\nhe entered the Senate. Once more Rome was without a master.",
        "There were two men who tried to continue the tradition of\nCaesar’s glory. One was Antony, his former secretary. The\nother was Octavian, Caesar’s grand-nephew and heir to his\nestate. Octavian remained in Rome, but Antony went to Egypt\nto be near Cleopatra with whom he too had fallen in love, as\nseems to have been the habit of Roman generals.",
        "A war broke out between the two. In the battle of Actium,\nOctavian defeated Antony. Antony killed himself and\nCleopatra was left alone to face the enemy. She tried very\nhard to make Octavian her third Roman conquest. When she\nsaw that she could make no impression upon this very proud\naristocrat, she killed herself, and Egypt became a Roman province.",
        "As for Octavian, he was a very wise young man and he did\nnot repeat the mistake of his famous uncle. He knew how\npeople will shy at words. He was very modest in his demands\nwhen he returned to Rome. He did not want to be a “dictator.\"\nHe would be entirely satisfied with the title of “the Honourable.\"\nBut when the Senate, a few years later, addressed\nhim as Augustus–the Illustrious–he did not object and a few\nyears later the man in the street called him Caesar, or Kaiser,\nwhile the soldiers, accustomed to regard Octavian as their\nCommander-in-chief referred to him as the Chief, the Imperator or\nEmperor. The Republic had become an Empire, but the average\nRoman was hardly aware of the fact.",
        "In 14 A.D. his position as the Absolute Ruler of the\nRoman people had become so well established that he was made\nan object of that divine worship which hitherto had been reserved\nfor the Gods. And his successors were true “Emperors\"–the\nabsolute rulers of the greatest empire the world had\never seen.",
        "If the truth be told, the average citizen was sick and tired\nof anarchy and disorder. He did not care who ruled him provided\nthe new master gave him a chance to live quietly and\nwithout the noise of eternal street riots. Octavian assured his\nsubjects forty years of peace. He had no desire to extend the\nfrontiers of his domains, In the year 9 A.D. he had contem-\nplated an invasion of the northwestern wilderness which was\ninhabited by the Teutons. But Varrus, his general, had been\nkilled with all his men in the Teutoburg Woods, and after that\nthe Romans made no further attempts to civilise these wild\npeople.",
        "They concentrated their efforts upon the gigantic problem\nof internal reform. But it was too late to do much good. Two\ncenturies of revolution and foreign war had repeatedly killed\nthe best men among the younger generations. It had ruined\nthe class of the free farmers. It had introduced slave labor,\nagainst which no freeman could hope to compete. It had\nturned the cities into beehives inhabited by pauperized and\nunhealthy mobs of runaway peasants. It had created a large\nbureaucracy–petty officials who were underpaid and who were\nforced to take graft in order to buy bread and clothing for\ntheir families. Worst of all, it had accustomed people to violence,\nto blood-shed, to a barbarous pleasure in the pain and\nsuffering of others.",
        "Outwardly, the Roman state during the first century of our\nera was a magnificent political structure, so large that Alexander’s\nempire became one of its minor provinces. Underneath\nthis glory there lived millions upon millions of poor and tired\nhuman beings, toiling like ants who have built a nest underneath\na heavy stone. They worked for the benefit of some one\nelse. They shared their food with the animals of the fields.\nThey lived in stables. They died without hope.",
        "It was the seven hundred and fifty-third year since the\nfounding of Rome. Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus\nwas living in the palace of the Palatine Hill, busily engaged\nupon the task of ruling his empire.",
        "In a little village of distant Syria, Mary, the wife of Joseph\nthe Carpenter, was tending her little boy, born in a stable of\nBethlehem.",
        "This is a strange world.",
        "Before long, the palace and the stable were to meet in open\ncombat.",
        "And the stable was to emerge victorious.",
        "THE STORY OF JOSHUA OF NAZARETH, WHOM\nTHE GREEKS CALLED JESUS",
        "IN the autumn of the year of the city 783 (which would be\n62 A.D., in our way of counting time) AEsculapius Cultellus, a\nRoman physician, wrote to his nephew who was with the army\nin Syria as follows:",
        "My dear Nephew,",
        "A few days ago I was called in to prescribe for a sick man\nnamed Paul. He appeared to be a Roman citizen of Jewish\nparentage, well educated and of agreeable manners. I had\nbeen told that he was here in connection with a law-suit, an appeal\nfrom one of our provincial courts, Caesarea or some such\nplace in the eastern Mediterranean. He had been described to\nme as a “wild and violent” fellow who had been making\nspeeches against the People and against the Law. I found him\nvery intelligent and of great honesty.",
        "A friend of mine who used to be with the army in Asia\nMinor tells me that he heard something about him in Ephesus\nwhere he was preaching sermons about a strange new God. I\nasked my patient if this were true and whether he had told the\npeople to rebel against the will of our beloved Emperor. Paul\nanswered me that the Kingdom of which he had spoken was\nnot of this world and he added many strange utterances which\nI did not understand, but which were probably due to his\nfever.",
        "His personality made a great impression upon me and I\nwas sorry to hear that he was killed on the Ostian Road a few\ndays ago. Therefore I am writing this letter to you. When\nnext you visit Jerusalem, I want you to find out something\nabout my friend Paul and the strange Jewish prophet, who\nseems to have been his teacher. Our slaves are getting much\nexcited about this so-called Messiah, and a few of them, who\nopenly talked of the new kingdom (whatever that means) have\nbeen crucified.

        "I received your letter and I have obeyed your instructions.",
        "Two weeks ago our brigade was sent to Jerusalem. There\nhave been several revolutions during the last century and there\nis not much left of the old city. We have been here now for a\nmonth and to-morrow we shall continue our march to Petra,\nwhere there has been trouble with some of the Arab tribes. I\nshall use this evening to answer your questions, but pray do\nnot expect a detailed report.",
        "I have talked with most of the older men in this city but\nfew have been able to give me any definite information. A\nfew days ago a pedler came to the camp. I bought some of\nhis olives and I asked him whether he had ever heard of the\nfamous Messiah who was killed when he was young. He said\nthat he remembered it very clearly, because his father had\ntaken him to Golgotha (a hill just outside the city) to see\nthe execution, and to show him what became of the enemies of\nthe laws of the people of Judaea. He gave me the address of\none Joseph, who had been a personal friend of the Messiah\nand told me that I had better go and see him if I wanted to\nknow more.",
        "This morning I went to call on Joseph. He was quite an\nold man. He had been a fisherman on one of the fresh-water\nlakes. His memory was clear, and from him at last I got a\nfairly definite account of what had happened during the\ntroublesome days before I was born.",
        "Tiberius, our great and glorious emperor, was on the throne,\nand an officer of the name of Pontius Pilatus was governor of\nJudaea and Samaria. Joseph knew little about this Pilatus.\nHe seemed to have been an honest enough official who left a\ndecent reputation as procurator of the province. In the year\n755 or 756 (Joseph had forgotten when) Pilatus was called to\nJerusalem on account of a riot. A certain young man (the\nson of a carpenter of Nazareth) was said to be planning a\nrevolution against the Roman government. Strangely enough\nour own intelligence officers, who are usually well informed,\nappear to have heard nothing about it, and when they investigated\nthe matter they reported that the carpenter was an\nexcellent citizen and that there was no reason to proceed against\nhim. But the old-fashioned leaders of the Jewish faith, according\nto Joseph, were much upset. They greatly disliked his\npopularity with the masses of the poorer Hebrews. The\n\"Nazarene” (so they told Pilatus) had publicly claimed that a\nGreek or a Roman or even a Philistine, who tried to live a decent\nand honourable life, was quite as good as a Jew who spent\nhis days studying the ancient laws of Moses. Pilatus does not\nseem to have been impressed by this argument, but when the\ncrowds around the temple threatened to lynch Jesus, and kill\nall his followers, he decided to take the carpenter into custody\nto save his life.",
        "He does not appear to have understood the real nature of\nthe quarrel. Whenever he asked the Jewish priests to explain\ntheir grievances, they shouted “heresy” and “treason” and got\nterribly excited. Finally, so Joseph told me, Pilatus sent for\nJoshua (that was the name of the Nazarene, but the Greeks\nwho live in this part of the world always refer to him as Jesus)\nto examine him personally. He talked to him for several\nhours. He asked him about the “dangerous doctrines” which\nhe was said to have preached on the shores of the sea of Galilee.\nBut Jesus answered that he never referred to politics. He was\nnot so much interested in the bodies of men as in Man’s soul.\nHe wanted all people to regard their neighbours as their\nbrothers and to love one single God, who was the father of all\nliving beings.",
        "Pilatus, who seems to have been well versed in the doctrines\nof the Stoics and the other Greek philosophers, does not appear\nto have discovered anything seditious in the talk of Jesus.\nAccording to my informant he made another attempt to save\nthe life of the kindly prophet. He kept putting the execution\noff. Meanwhile the Jewish people, lashed into fury by their\npriests, got frantic with rage. There had been many riots in\nJerusalem before this and there were only a few Roman soldiers\nwithin calling distance. Reports were being sent to the\nRoman authorities in Caesarea that Pilatus had “fallen a victim\nto the teachings of the Nazarene.” Petitions were being\ncirculated all through the city to have Pilatus recalled, because\nhe was an enemy of the Emperor. You know that our governors\nhave strict instructions to avoid an open break with\ntheir foreign subjects. To save the country from civil war,\nPilatus finally sacrificed his prisoner, Joshua, who behaved\nwith great dignity and who forgave all those who hated him.\nHe was crucified amidst the howls and the laughter of the\nJerusalem mob.",
        "That is what Joseph told me, with tears running down his\nold cheeks. I gave him a gold piece when I left him, but he\nrefused it and asked me to hand it to one poorer than himself.\nI also asked him a few questions about your friend Paul. He\nhad known him slightly. He seems to have been a tent maker\nwho gave up his profession that he might preach the words of\na loving and forgiving God, who was so very different from\nthat Jehovah of whom the Jewish priests are telling us all\nthe time. Afterwards, Paul appears to have travelled much\nin Asia Minor and in Greece, telling the slaves that they were\nall children of one loving Father and that happiness awaits all,\nboth rich and poor, who have tried to live honest lives and have\ndone good to those who were suffering and miserable.",
        "I hope that I have answered your questions to your satisfaction.\nThe whole story seems very harmless to me as far as\nthe safety of the state is concerned. But then, we Romans\nnever have been able to understand the people of this province.\nI am sorry that they have killed your friend Paul. I wish that\nI were at home again, and I am, as ever,\n                         Your dutiful nephew,\n                                   GLADIUS ENSA.",
        "THE TWILIGHT OF ROME",
        "THE text-books of ancient History give the date 476 as the\nyear in which Rome fell, because in that year the last emperor\nwas driven off his throne. But Rome, which was not built in\na day, took a long time falling. The process was so slow and\nso gradual that most Romans did not realise how their old\nworld was coming to an end. They complained about the unrest\nof the times–they grumbled about the high prices of food\nand about the low wages of the workmen–they cursed the\nprofiteers who had a monopoly of the grain and the wool and\nthe gold coin. Occasionally they rebelled against an unusually\nrapacious governor. But the majority of the people during the\nfirst four centuries of our era ate and drank (whatever their\npurse allowed them to buy) and hated or loved (according to\ntheir nature) and went to the theatre (whenever there was a\nfree show of fighting gladiators) or starved in the slums of the\nbig cities, utterly ignorant of the fact that their empire had\noutlived its usefulness and was doomed to perish.",
        "How could they realise the threatened danger? Rome\nmade a fine showing of outward glory. Well-paved roads connected\nthe different provinces, the imperial police were active\nand showed little tenderness for highwaymen. The frontier\nwas closely guarded against the savage tribes who seemed to\nbe occupying the waste lands of northern Europe. The whole\nworld was paying tribute to the mighty city of Rome, and a\nscore of able men were working day and night to undo the\nmistakes of the past and bring about a return to the happier\nconditions of the early Republic.",
        "But the underlying causes of the decay of the State, of\nwhich I have told you in a former chapter, had not been\nremoved and reform therefore was impossible.",
        "Rome was, first and last and all the time, a city-state as\nAthens and Corinth had been city-states in ancient Hellas. It\nhad been able to dominate the Italian peninsula. But Rome\nas the ruler of the entire civilised world was a political\nimpossibility and could not endure. Her young men were killed in\nher endless wars. Her farmers were ruined by long military\nservice and by taxation. They either became professional\nbeggars or hired themselves out to rich landowners who gave\nthem board and lodging in exchange for their services and\nmade them “serfs,” those unfortunate human beings who are\nneither slaves nor freemen, but who have become part of the\nsoil upon which they work, like so many cows, and the trees.",
        "The Empire, the State, had become everything. The common\ncitizen had dwindled down to less than nothing. As for\nthe slaves, they had heard the words that were spoken by Paul.\nThey had accepted the message of the humble carpenter of\nNazareth. They did not rebel against their masters. On the\ncontrary, they had been taught to be meek and they obeyed\ntheir superiors. But they had lost all interest in the affairs\nof this world which had proved such a miserable place of abode.\nThey were willing to fight the good fight that they might enter\ninto the Kingdom of Heaven. But they were not willing to\nengage in warfare for the benefit of an ambitious emperor who\naspired to glory by way of a foreign campaign in the land of\nthe Parthians or the Numidians or the Scots.",
        "And so conditions grew worse as the centuries went by.\nThe first Emperors had continued the tradition of “leadership\"\nwhich had given the old tribal chieftains such a hold upon\ntheir subjects. But the Emperors of the second and third\ncenturies were Barrack-Emperors, professional soldiers, who\nexisted by the grace of their body-guards, the so-called Prae-\ntorians. They succeeded each other with terrifying rapidity,\nmurdering their way into the palace and being murdered out\nof it as soon as their successors had become rich enough to bribe\nthe guards into a new rebellion.",
        "Meanwhile the barbarians were hammering at the gates of\nthe northern frontier. As there were no longer any native\nRoman armies to stop their progress, foreign mercenaries had\nto be hired to fight the invader. As the foreign soldier happened\nto be of the same blood as his supposed enemy, he was\napt to be quite lenient when he engaged in battle. Finally,\nby way of experiment, a few tribes were allowed to settle\nwithin the confines of the Empire. Others followed. Soon\nthese tribes complained bitterly of the greedy Roman tax-\ngatherers, who took away their last penny. When they got\nno redress they marched to Rome and loudly demanded that\nthey be heard.",
        "This made Rome very uncomfortable as an Imperial residence.\nConstantine (who ruled from 323 to 337) looked for\na new capital. He chose Byzantium, the gate-way for the\ncommerce between Europe and Asia. The city was renamed\nConstantinople, and the court moved eastward. When Constantine\ndied, his two sons, for the sake of a more efficient\nadministration, divided the Empire between them. The elder\nlived in Rome and ruled in the west. The younger stayed in\nConstantinople and was master of the east.",
        "Then came the fourth century and the terrible visitation\nof the Huns, those mysterious Asiatic horsemen who for more\nthan two centuries maintained themselves in Northern Europe\nand continued their career of bloodshed until they were defeated\nnear Chalons-sur-Marne in France in the year 451.\nAs soon as the Huns had reached the Danube they had begun\nto press hard upon the Goths. The Goths, in order to save\nthemselves, were thereupon obliged to invade Rome. The\nEmperor Valens tried to stop them, but was killed near\nAdrianople in the year 378. Twenty-two years later, under\ntheir king, Alaric, these same West Goths marched westward\nand attacked Rome. They did not plunder, and destroyed\nonly a few palaces. Next came the Vandals, and showed less\nrespect for the venerable traditions of the city. Then the\nBurgundians. Then the East Goths. Then the Alemanni.\nThen the Franks. There was no end to the invasions. Rome\nat last was at the mercy of every ambitious highway robber\nwho could gather a few followers.",
        "In the year 402 the Emperor fled to Ravenna, which was\na sea-port and strongly fortified, and there, in the year 475,\nOdoacer, commander of a regiment of the German mercenaries,\nwho wanted the farms of Italy to be divided among themselves,\ngently but effectively pushed Romulus Augustulus, the\nlast of the emperors who ruled the western division, from his\nthrone, and proclaimed himself Patriarch or ruler of Rome.\nThe eastern Emperor, who was very busy with his own affairs,\nrecognised him, and for ten years Odoacer ruled what was\nleft of the western provinces.",
        "A few years later, Theodoric, King of the East Goths,\ninvaded the newly formed Patriciat, took Ravenna, murdered\nOdoacer at his own dinner table, and established a Gothic\nKingdom amidst the ruins of the western part of the Empire.\nThis Patriciate state did not last long. In the sixth century a\nmotley crowd of Longobards and Saxons and Slavs and Avars\ninvaded Italy, destroyed the Gothic kingdom, and established\na new state of which Pavia became the capital.",
        "Then at last the imperial city sank into a state of utter\nneglect and despair. The ancient palaces had been plundered\ntime and again. The schools had been burned down. The\nteachers had been starved to death. The rich people had been\nthrown out of their villas which were now inhabited by evil-\nsmelling and hairy barbarians. The roads had fallen into\ndecay. The old bridges were gone and commerce had come\nto a standstill. Civilisation–the product of thousands of years\nof patient labor on the part of Egyptians and Babylonians and\nGreeks and Romans, which had lifted man high above the\nmost daring dreams of his earliest ancestors, threatened to\nperish from the western continent.",
        "It is true that in the far east, Constantinople continued to\nbe the centre of an Empire for another thousand years. But\nit hardly counted as a part of the European continent. Its\ninterests lay in the east. It began to forget its western origin.\nGradually the Roman language was given up for the Greek.\nThe Roman alphabet was discarded and Roman law was written\nin Greek characters and explained by Greek judges. The\nEmperor became an Asiatic despot, worshipped as the god-like\nkings of Thebes had been worshipped in the valley of the\nNile, three thousand years before. When missionaries of the\nByzantine church looked for fresh fields of activity, they went\neastward and carried the civilisation of Byzantium into the\nvast wilderness of Russia.",
        "As for the west, it was left to the mercies of the Barbarians.\nFor twelve generations, murder, war, arson, plundering were\nthe order of the day. One thing–and one thing alone–saved\nEurope from complete destruction, from a return to the days\nof cave-men and the hyena.",
        "This was the church–the flock of humble men and women\nwho for many centuries had confessed themselves the followers\nof Jesus, the carpenter of Nazareth, who had been\nkilled that the mighty Roman Empire might be saved the\ntrouble of a street-riot in a little city somewhere along the\nSyrian frontier.",
        "HOW ROME BECAME THE CENTRE OF THE\nCHRISTIAN WORLD",
        "THE average intelligent Roman who lived under the Empire\nhad taken very little interest in the gods of his fathers.\nA few times a year he went to the temple, but merely as a\nmatter of custom. He looked on patiently when the people\ncelebrated a religious festival with a solemn procession. But he\nregarded the worship of Jupiter and Minerva and Neptune as\nsomething rather childish, a survival from the crude days of\nthe early republic and not a fit subject of study for a man\nwho had mastered the works of the Stoics and the Epicureans\nand the other great philosophers of Athens.",
        "This attitude made the Roman a very tolerant man. The\ngovernment insisted that all people, Romans, foreigners,\nGreeks, Babylonians, Jews, should pay a certain outward respect\nto the image of the Emperor which was supposed to stand\nin every temple, just as a picture of the President of the\nUnited States is apt to hang in an American Post Office. But\nthis was a formality without any deeper meaning. Generally\nspeaking everybody could honour, revere and adore whatever\ngods he pleased, and as a result, Rome was filled with all\nsorts of queer little temples and synagogues, dedicated to the\nworship of Egyptian and African and Asiatic divinities.",
        "When the first disciples of Jesus reached Rome and began\nto preach their new doctrine of a universal brotherhood of man,\nnobody objected. The man in the street stopped and listened\nRome, the capital of the world, had always been full of wandering\npreachers, each proclaiming his own “mystery.” Most of\nthe self-appointed priests appealed to the senses–promised\ngolden rewards and endless pleasure to the followers of their\nown particular god. Soon the crowd in the street noticed\nthat the so-called Christians (the followers of the Christ or\n\"anointed”) spoke a very different language. They did not\nappear to be impressed by great riches or a noble position.\nThey extolled the beauties of poverty and humility and meekness.\nThese were not exactly the virtues which had made\nRome the mistress of the world. It was rather interesting to\nlisten to a “mystery” which told people in the hey-day of their\nglory that their worldly success could not possibly bring them\nlasting happiness.",
        "Besides, the preachers of the Christian mystery told dreadful\nstories of the fate that awaited those who refused to listen to\nthe words of the true God. It was never wise to take chances.\nOf course the old Roman gods still existed, but were they\nstrong enough to protect their friends against the powers of\nthis new deity who had been brought to Europe from distant\nAsia? People began to have doubts. They returned to listen\nto further explanations of the new creed. After a while they\nbegan to meet the men and women who preached the words of\nJesus. They found them very different from the average\nRoman priests. They were all dreadfully poor. They were\nkind to slaves and to animals. They did not try to gain riches,\nbut gave away whatever they had. The example of their unselfish\nlives forced many Romans to forsake the old religion.\nThey joined the small communities of Christians who met in\nthe back rooms of private houses or somewhere in an open field,\nand the temples were deserted.",
        "This went on year after year and the number of Christians\ncontinued to increase. Presbyters or priests (the original\nGreek meant “elder”) were elected to guard the interests of\nthe small churches. A bishop was made the head of all the\ncommunities within a single province. Peter, who had fol-\nlowed Paul to Rome, was the first Bishop of Rome. In due\ntime his successors (who were addressed as Father or Papa)\ncame to be known as Popes.",
        "The church became a powerful institution within the Empire.\nThe Christian doctrines appealed to those who despaired\nof this world. They also attracted many strong men who\nfound it impossible to make a career under the Imperial gov-\nernment, but who could exercise their gifts of leadership among\nthe humble followers of the Nazarene teacher. At last the\nstate was obliged to take notice. The Roman Empire (I have\nsaid this before) was tolerant through indifference. It allowed\neverybody to seek salvation after his or her own fashion. But\nit insisted that the different sects keep the peace among themselves\nand obey the wise rule of “live and let live.”",
        "The Christian communities however, refused to practice any\nsort of tolerance. They publicly declared that their God, and\ntheir God alone, was the true ruler of Heaven and Earth,\nand that all other gods were imposters. This seemed unfair\nto the other sects and the police discouraged such utterances.\nThe Christians persisted.",
        "Soon there were further difficulties. The Christians refused\nto go through the formalities of paying homage to the emperor.\nThey refused to appear when they were called upon\nto join the army. The Roman magistrates threatened to\npunish them. The Christians answered that this miserable\nworld was only the ante-room to a very pleasant Heaven and\nthat they were more than willing to suffer death for their\nprinciples. The Romans, puzzled by such conduct, sometimes\nkilled the offenders, but more often they did not. There was\na certain amount of lynching during the earliest years of the\nchurch, but this was the work of that part of the mob which\naccused their meek Christian neighbours of every conceivable\ncrime, (such as slaughtering and eating babies, bringing about\nsickness and pestilence, betraying the country in times of danger)\nbecause it was a harmless sport and devoid of danger, as\nthe Christians refused to fight back.",
        "Meanwhile, Rome continued to be invaded by the Barbarians\nand when her armies failed, Christian missionaries went\nforth to preach their gospel of peace to the wild Teutons.\nThey were strong men without fear of death. They spoke a\nlanguage which left no doubt as to the future of unrepentant\nsinners. The Teutons were deeply impressed. They still\nhad a deep respect for the wisdom of the ancient city of Rome.\nThose men were Romans. They probably spoke the truth.\nSoon the Christian missionary became a power in the savage\nregions of the Teutons and the Franks. Half a dozen missionaries\nwere as valuable as a whole regiment of soldiers.\nThe Emperors began to understand that the Christian might\nbe of great use to them. In some of the provinces they were\ngiven equal rights with those who remained faithful to the old\ngods. The great change however came during the last half\nof the fourth century.",
        "Constantine, sometimes (Heaven knows why) called Constantine\nthe Great, was emperor. He was a terrible ruffian,\nbut people of tender qualities could hardly hope to survive\nin that hard-fighting age. During a long and checkered career,\nConstantine had experienced many ups and downs. Once,\nwhen almost defeated by his enemies, he thought that he would\ntry the power of this new Asiatic deity of whom everybody was\ntalking. He promised that he too would become a Christian\nif he were successful in the coming battle. He won the victory\nand thereafter he was convinced of the power of the Christian\nGod and allowed himself to be baptised.",
        "From that moment on, the Christian church was officially\nrecognised and this greatly strengthened the position of the\nnew faith.",
        "But the Christians still formed a very small minority of\nall the people, (not more than five or six percent,) and in order\nto win, they were forced to refuse all compromise. The old\ngods must be destroyed. For a short spell the emperor Julian,\na lover of Greek wisdom, managed to save the pagan Gods\nfrom further destruction. But Julian died of his wounds during\na campaign in Persia and his successor Jovian re-established\nthe church in all its glory. One after the other the doors of the\nancient temples were then closed. Then came the emperor\nJustinian (who built the church of Saint Sophia in Constantinople),\nwho discontinued the school of philosophy at Athens\nwhich had been founded by Plato.",
        "That was the end of the old Greek world, in which man\nhad been allowed to think his own thoughts and dream his own\ndreams according to his desires. The somewhat vague rules\nof conduct of the philosophers had proved a poor compass\nby which to steer the ship of life after a deluge of savagery\nand ignorance had swept away the established order of things.\nThere was need of something more positive and more definite.\nThis the Church provided.",
        "During an age when nothing was certain, the church stood\nlike a rock and never receded from those principles which it\nheld to be true and sacred. This steadfast courage gained the\nadmiration of the multitudes and carried the church of Rome\nsafely through the difficulties which destroyed the Roman state.",
        "There was however, a certain element of luck in the final\nsuccess of the Christian faith. After the disappearance of\nTheodoric’s Roman-Gothic kingdom, in the fifth century,\nItaly was comparatively free from foreign invasion. The\nLombards and Saxons and Slavs who succeeded the Goths were\nweak and backward tribes. Under those circumstances it was\npossible for the bishops of Rome to maintain the independence\nof their city. Soon the remnants of the empire, scattered\nthroughout the peninsula, recognised the Dukes of Rome (or\nbishops) as their political and spiritual rulers.",
        "The stage was set for the appearance of a strong man.\nHe came in the year 590 and his name was Gregory. He belonged\nto the ruling classes of ancient Rome, and he had\nbeen “prefect” or mayor of the city. Then he had become\na monk and a bishop and finally, and much against his will,\n(for he wanted to be a missionary and preach Christianity to\nthe heathen of England,) he had been dragged to the Church\nof Saint Peter to be made Pope. He ruled only fourteen\nyears but when he died the Christian world of western Europe\nhad officially recognised the bishops of Rome, the Popes, as\nthe head of the entire church.",
        "This power, however, did not extend to the east. In\nConstantinople the Emperors continued the old custom which had\nrecognised the successors of Augustus and Tiberius both as\nhead of the government and as High Priest of the Established\nReligion. In the year 1453 the eastern Roman Empire was\nconquered by the Turks. Constantinople was taken, and Constantine\nPaleologue, the last Roman Emperor, was killed on\nthe steps of the Church of the Holy Sophia.",
        "A few years before, Zoe, the daughter of his brother\nThomas, had married Ivan III of Russia. In this way did the\ngrand-dukes of Moscow fall heir to the traditions of Constantinople.\nThe double-eagle of old Byzantium (reminiscent of\nthe days when Rome had been divided into an eastern and a\nwestern part) became the coat of arms of modern Russia.\nThe Tsar who had been merely the first of the Russian nobles,\nassumed the aloofness and the dignity of a Roman emperor\nbefore whom all subjects, both high and low, were inconsiderable\nslaves.",
        "The court was refashioned after the oriental pattern which\nthe eastern Emperors had imported from Asia and from Egypt\nand which (so they flattered themselves) resembled the court\nof Alexander the Great. This strange inheritance which the\ndying Byzantine Empire bequeathed to an unsuspecting world\ncontinued to live with great vigour for six more centuries,\namidst the vast plains of Russia. The last man to wear the\ncrown with the double eagle of Constantinople, Tsar Nicholas,\nwas murdered only the other day, so to speak. His body was\nthrown into a well. His son and his daughters were all killed.\nAll his ancient rights and prerogatives were abolished, and the\nchurch was reduced to the position which it had held in Rome\nbefore the days of Constantine.",
        "The eastern church however fared very differently, as we\nshall see in the next chapter when the whole Christian world is\ngoing to be threatened with destruction by the rival creed of\nan Arab camel-driver.",
        "AHMED, THE CAMEL-DRIVER, WHO BECAME\nTHE PROPHET OF THE ARABIAN DESERT\nAND WHOSE FOLLOWERS ALMOST\nCONQUERED THE ENTIRE KNOWN WORLD\nFOR THE GREATER GLORY OF ALLAH, THE\nONLY TRUE GOD",
        "SINCE the days of Carthage and Hannibal we have said\nnothing of the Semitic people. You will remember how they\nfilled all the chapters devoted to the story of the Ancient World.\nThe Babylonians, the Assyrians, the Phoenicians, the Jews,\nthe Arameans, the Chaldeans, all of them Semites, had been\nthe rulers of western Asia for thirty or forty centuries. They\nhad been conquered by the Indo-European Persians who had\ncome from the east and by the Indo-European Greeks who\nhad come from the west. A hundred years after the death of\nAlexander the Great, Carthage, a colony of Semitic Phoenicians,\nhad fought the Indo-European Romans for the mastery\nof the Mediterranean. Carthage had been defeated and destroyed\nand for eight hundred years the Romans had been masters\nof the world. In the seventh century, however, another\nSemitic tribe appeared upon the scene and challenged the\npower of the west. They were the Arabs, peaceful shepherds\nwho had roamed through the desert since the beginning of time\nwithout showing any signs of imperial ambitions.",
        "Then they listened to Mohammed, mounted their horses and\nin less than a century they had pushed to the heart of Europe\nand proclaimed the glories of Allah, “the only God,” and\nMohammed, “the prophet of the only God,” to the frightened\npeasants of France.",
        "The story of Ahmed, the son of Abdallah and Aminah\n(usually known as Mohammed, or “he who will be praised,\";\nreads like a chapter in the “Thousand and One Nights.” He\nwas a camel-driver, born in Mecca. He seems to have been an\nepileptic and he suffered from spells of unconsciousness when\nhe dreamed strange dreams and heard the voice of the angel\nGabriel, whose words were afterwards written down in a book\ncalled the Koran. His work as a caravan leader carried him\nall over Arabia and he was constantly falling in with Jewish\nmerchants and with Christian traders, and he came to see that\nthe worship of a single God was a very excellent thing. His\nown people, the Arabs, still revered queer stones and trunks\nof trees as their ancestors had done, tens of thousands of\nyears before. In Mecca, their holy city, stood a little square\nbuilding, the Kaaba, full of idols and strange odds and ends\nof Hoo-doo worship.",
        "Mohammed decided to be the Moses of the Arab people. He\ncould not well be a prophet and a camel-driver at the same time.\nSo he made himself independent by marrying his employer, the\nrich widow Chadija. Then he told his neighbours in Mecca\nthat he was the long-expected prophet sent by Allah to save the\nworld. The neighbours laughed most heartily and when Mohammed\ncontinued to annoy them with his speeches they decided to kill him.\nThey regarded him as a lunatic and a public bore who deserved no mercy.\nMohammed heard of the plot and in the dark of night he fled to Medina\ntogether with Abu Bekr, his trusted pupil. This happened\nin the year 622. It is the most important date in Mohammedan\nhistory and is known as the Hegira–the year of the Great Flight.",
        "In Medina, Mohammed, who was a stranger, found it easier\nto proclaim himself a prophet than in his home city, where\nevery one had known him as a simple camel-driver. Soon he\nwas surrounded by an increasing number of followers, or\nMoslems, who accepted the Islam, “the submission to the will\nof God,” which Mohammed praised as the highest of all virtues.\nFor seven years he preached to the people of Medina. Then\nhe believed himself strong enough to begin a campaign against\nhis former neighbours who had dared to sneer at him and his\nHoly Mission in his old camel-driving days. At the head of\nan army of Medinese he marched across the desert. His followers\ntook Mecca without great difficulty, and having slaughtered\na number of the inhabitants, they found it quite easy to\nconvince the others that Mohammed was really a great prophet.",
        "From that time on until the year of his death, Mohammed\nwas fortunate in everything he undertook.",
        "There are two reasons for the success of Islam. In the\nfirst place, the creed which Mohammed taught to his followers\nwas very simple. The disciples were told that they must love\nAllah, the Ruler of the World, the Merciful and Compassionate.\nThey must honour and obey their parents. They\nwere warned against dishonesty in dealing with their neighbours\nand were admonished to be humble and charitable, to the\npoor and to the sick. Finally they were ordered to abstain\nfrom strong drink and to be very frugal in what they ate. That\nwas all. There were no priests, who acted as shepherds of\ntheir flocks and asked that they be supported at the common\nexpense. The Mohammedan churches or mosques were merely\nlarge stone halls without benches or pictures, where the faithful\ncould gather (if they felt so inclined) to read and discuss\nchapters from the Koran, the Holy Book. But the average\nMohammedan carried his religion with him and never felt\nhimself hemmed in by the restrictions and regulations of an\nestablished church. Five times a day he turned his face towards\nMecca, the Holy City, and said a simple prayer. For the\nrest of the time he let Allah rule the world as he saw fit and\naccepted whatever fate brought him with patient resignation.",
        "Of course such an attitude towards life did not encourage\nthe Faithful to go forth and invent electrical machinery or\nbother about railroads and steamship lines. But it gave every\nMohammedan a certain amount of contentment. It bade\nhim be at peace with himself and with the world in which he\nlived and that was a very good thing.",
        "The second reason which explains the success of the Moslems\nin their warfare upon the Christians, had to do with the\nconduct of those Mohammedan soldiers who went forth to do\nbattle for the true faith. The Prophet promised that those\nwho fell, facing the enemy, would go directly to Heaven.\nThis made sudden death in the field preferable to a long but\ndreary existence upon this earth. It gave the Mohammedans\nan enormous advantage over the Crusaders who were in constant\ndread of a dark hereafter, and who stuck to the good\nthings of this world as long as they possibly could. Incidentally\nit explains why even to-day Moslem soldiers will charge\ninto the fire of European machine guns quite indifferent to\nthe fate that awaits them and why they are such dangerous\nand persistent enemies.",
        "Having put his religious house in order, Mohammed now\nbegan to enjoy his power as the undisputed ruler of a large\nnumber of Arab tribes. But success has been the undoing of\na large number of men who were great in the days of adversity.\nHe tried to gain the good will of the rich people by a number\nof regulations which could appeal to those of wealth.\nHe allowed the Faithful to have four wives. As one wife\nwas a costly investment in those olden days when brides were\nbought directly from the parents, four wives became a positive\nluxury except to those who possessed camels and dromedaries\nand date orchards beyond the dreams of avarice. A religion\nwhich at first had been meant for the hardy hunters of the\nhigh skied desert was gradually transformed to suit the needs\nof the smug merchants who lived in the bazaars of the cities.\nIt was a regrettable change from the original program and it\ndid very little good to the cause of Mohammedanism. As for\nthe prophet himself, he went on preaching the truth of Allah\nand proclaiming new rules of conduct until he died, quite\nsuddenly, of a fever on June the seventh of the year 632.",
        "His successor as Caliph (or leader) of the Moslems was\nhis father-in-law, Abu-Bekr, who had shared the early dangers\nof the prophet’s life. Two years later, Abu-Bekr died and\nOmar ibn Al-Khattab followed him. In less than ten years\nhe conquered Egypt, Persia, Phoenicia, Syria and Palestine\nand made Damascus the capital of the first Mohammedan world\nempire.",
        "Omar was succeeded by Ali, the husband of Mohammed’s\ndaughter, Fatima, but a quarrel broke out upon a point of\nMoslem doctrine and Ali was murdered. After his death,\nthe caliphate was made hereditary and the leaders of the faithful\nwho had begun their career as the spiritual head of a religious\nsect became the rulers of a vast empire. They built\na new city on the shores of the Euphrates, near the ruins of\nBabylon and called it Bagdad, and organising the Arab horsemen\ninto regiments of cavalry, they set forth to bring the\nhappiness of their Moslem faith to all unbelievers. In the\nyear 700 A.D. a Mohammedan general by the name of Tarik\ncrossed the old gates of Hercules and reached the high rock\non the European side which he called the Gibel-al-tarik, the\nHill of Tarik or Gibraltar.",
        "Eleven years later in the battle of Xeres de la Frontera,\nhe defeated the king of the Visigoths and then the Moslem\narmy moved northward and following the route of Hannibal,\nthey crossed the passes of the Pyrenees. They defeated the\nDuke of Aquitania, who tried to halt them near Bordeaux,\nand marched upon Paris. But in the year 732 (one\nhundred years after the death of the prophet,) they were\nbeaten in a battle between Tours and Poitiers. On that\nday, Charles Martel (Charles with the Hammer) the Frankish\nchieftain, saved Europe from a Mohammedan con-\nquest. He drove the Moslems out of France, but they maintained\nthemselves in Spain where Abd-ar-Rahman founded the\nCaliphate of Cordova, which became the greatest centre of\nscience and art of mediaeval Europe.",
        "This Moorish kingdom, so-called because the people came\nfrom Mauretania in Morocco, lasted seven centuries. It was\nonly after the capture of Granada, the last Moslem stronghold,\nin the year 1492, that Columbus received the royal grant which\nallowed him to go upon a voyage of discovery. The Mohammedans\nsoon regained their strength in the new conquests\nwhich they made in Asia and Africa and to-day there are as\nmany followers of Mohammed as there are of Christ.",
        "HOW CHARLEMAGNE, THE KING OF THE\nFRANKS, CAME TO BEAR THE TITLE OF\nEMPEROR AND TRIED TO REVIVE THE OLD\nIDEAL OF WORLD-EMPIRE",
        "THE battle of Poitiers had saved Europe from the\nMohammedans. But the enemy within–the hopeless disorder\nwhich had followed the disappearance of the Roman police\nofficer–that enemy remained. It is true that the new converts\nof the Christian faith in Northern Europe felt a deep respect\nfor the mighty Bishop of Rome. But that poor bishop did\nnot feel any too safe when he looked toward the distant\nmountains. Heaven knew what fresh hordes of barbarians were\nready to cross the Alps and begin a new attack on Rome. It\nwas necessary–very necessary–for the spiritual head of the\nworld to find an ally with a strong sword and a powerful\nfist who was willing to defend His Holiness in case of danger.",
        "And so the Popes, who were not only very holy but\nalso very practical, cast about for a friend, and presently\nthey made overtures to the most promising of the Germanic\ntribes who had occupied north-western Europe after the fall\nof Rome. They were called the Franks. One of their earliest\nkings, called Merovech, had helped the Romans in the battle of\nthe Catalaunian fields in the year 451 when they defeated the\nHuns. His descendants, the Merovingians, had continued to\ntake little bits of imperial territory until the year 486 when\nking Clovis (the old French word for “Louis”) felt himself\nstrong enough to beat the Romans in the open. But his\ndescendants were weak men who left the affairs of state to\ntheir Prime minister, the “Major Domus” or Master of the\nPalace.",
        "Pepin the Short, the son of the famous Charles Martel,\nwho succeeded his father as Master of the Palace, hardly\nknew how to handle the situation. His royal master was a\ndevout theologian, without any interest in politics. Pepin\nasked the Pope for advice. The Pope who was a practical\nperson answered that the “power in the state belonged to him\nwho was actually possessed of it.” Pepin took the hint. He\npersuaded Childeric, the last of the Merovingians to become\na monk and then made himself king with the approval of the\nother Germanic chieftains. But this did not satisfy the shrewd\nPepin. He wanted to be something more than a barbarian\nchieftain. He staged an elaborate ceremony at which Boniface,\nthe great missionary of the European northwest, anointed\nhim and made him a “King by the grace of God.” It was\neasy to slip those words, “Del gratia,” into the coronation\nservice. It took almost fifteen hundred years to get them out\nagain.",
        "Pepin was sincerely grateful for this kindness on the part\nof the church. He made two expeditions to Italy to defend\nthe Pope against his enemies. He took Ravenna and several\nother cities away from the Longobards and presented them\nto His Holiness, who incorporated these new domains into\nthe so-called Papal State, which remained an independent\ncountry until half a century ago.",
        "After Pepin’s death, the relations between Rome and Aix-\nla-Chapelle or Nymwegen or Ingelheim, (the Frankish Kings\ndid not have one official residence, but travelled from place to\nplace with all their ministers and court officers,) became more\nand more cordial. Finally the Pope and the King took a step\nwhich was to influence the history of Europe in a most profound\nway.",
        "Charles, commonly known as Carolus Magnus or Char-\nlemagne, succeeded Pepin in the year 768. He had conquered\nthe land of the Saxons in eastern Germany and had\nbuilt towns and monasteries all over the greater part of northern\nEurope. At the request of certain enemies of Abd-ar-\nRahman, he had invaded Spain to fight the Moors. But in\nthe Pyrenees he had been attacked by the wild Basques and\nhad been forced to retire. It was upon this occasion that Roland,\nthe great Margrave of Breton, showed what a Frankish\nchieftain of those early days meant when he promised to be\nfaithful to his King, and gave his life and that of his trusted\nfollowers to safeguard the retreat of the royal army.",
        "During the last ten years of the eighth century, however,\nCharles was obliged to devote himself exclusively to affairs of\nthe South. The Pope, Leo III, had been attacked by a band\nof Roman rowdies and had been left for dead in the street.\nSome kind people had bandaged his wounds and had helped\nhim to escape to the camp of Charles, where he asked for\nhelp. An army of Franks soon restored quiet and carried Leo\nback to the Lateran Palace which ever since the days of Constantine,\nhad been the home of the Pope. That was in December\nof the year 799. On Christmas day of the next year,\nCharlemagne, who was staying in Rome, attended the service\nin the ancient church of St. Peter. When he arose from prayer,\nthe Pope placed a crown upon his head, called him Emperor of\nthe Romans and hailed him once more with the title of “Augustus\"\nwhich had not been heard for hundreds of years.",
        "Once more Northern Europe was part of a Roman Empire,\nbut the dignity was held by a German chieftain who could\nread just a little and never learned to write. But he could\nfight and for a short while there was order and even the rival\nemperor in Constantinople sent a letter of approval to his\n\"dear Brother.”",
        "Unfortunately this splendid old man died in the year 814.\nHis sons and his grandsons at once began to fight for the\nlargest share of the imperial inheritance. Twice the Carolingian\nlands were divided, by the treaties of Verdun in the\nyear 843 and by the treaty of Mersen-on-the-Meuse in the\nyear 870. The latter treaty divided the entire Frankish Kingdom\ninto two parts. Charles the Bold received the western\nhalf. It contained the old Roman province called Gaul where\nthe language of the people had become thoroughly romanized.\nThe Franks soon learned to speak this language and this\naccounts for the strange fact that a purely Germanic land\nlike France should speak a Latin tongue.",
        "The other grandson got the eastern part, the land which\nthe Romans had called Germania. Those inhospitable regions\nhad never been part of the old Empire. Augustus had\ntried to conquer this “far east,” but his legions had been\nannihilated in the Teutoburg Wood in the year 9 and the people had\nnever been influenced by the higher Roman civilisation. They\nspoke the popular Germanic tongue. The Teuton word for\n\"people” was “thiot.” The Christian missionaries therefore\ncalled the German language the “lingua theotisca” or the\n\"lingua teutisca,” the “popular dialect” and this word\n\"teutisca” was changed into “Deutsch” which accounts for the name\n\"Deutschland.”",
        "As for the famous Imperial Crown, it very soon slipped\noff the heads of the Carolingian successors and rolled back onto\nthe Italian plain, where it became a sort of plaything of a\nnumber of little potentates who stole the crown from each other\namidst much bloodshed and wore it (with or without the permission\nof the Pope) until it was the turn of some more ambitious\nneighbour. The Pope, once more sorely beset by his\nenemies, sent north for help. He did not appeal to the ruler\nof the west-Frankish kingdom, this time. His messengers\ncrossed the Alps and addressed themselves to Otto, a Saxon\nPrince who was recognised as the greatest chieftain of the\ndifferent Germanic tribes.",
        "Otto, who shared his people’s affection for the blue skies\nand the gay and beautiful people of the Italian peninsula,\nhastened to the rescue. In return for his services, the Pope,\nLeo VIII, made Otto “Emperor,” and the eastern half of\nCharles’ old kingdom was henceforth known as the “Holy\nRoman Empire of the German Nation.”",
        "This strange political creation managed to live to the ripe\nold age of eight hundred and thirty-nine years. In the year\n1801, (during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson,) it was\nmost unceremoniously relegated to the historical scrapheap.\nThe brutal fellow who destroyed the old Germanic Empire was\nthe son of a Corsican notary-public who had made a brilliant\ncareer in the service of the French Republic. He was ruler\nof Europe by the grace of his famous Guard Regiments, but\nhe desired to be something more. He sent to Rome for the\nPope and the Pope came and stood by while General Napoleon\nplaced the imperial crown upon his own head and proclaimed\nhimself heir to the tradition of Charlemagne. For history is\nlike life. The more things change, the more they remain\nthe same.",
        "WHY THE PEOPLE OF THE TENTH CENTURY\nPRAYED THE LORD TO PROTECT THEM\nFROM THE FURY OF THE NORSEMEN",
        "IN the third and fourth centuries, the Germanic tribes of\ncentral Europe had broken through the defences of the Empire\nthat they might plunder Rome and live on the fat of the\nland. In the eighth century it became the turn of the Germans\nto be the “plundered-ones.” They did not like this at all, even\nif their enemies were their first cousins, the Norsemen, who\nlived in Denmark and Sweden and Norway.",
        "What forced these hardy sailors to turn pirate we do not\nknow, but once they had discovered the advantages and pleasures\nof a buccaneering career there was no one who could stop\nthem. They would suddenly descend upon a peaceful Frankish\nor Frisian village, situated on the mouth of a river. They\nwould kill all the men and steal all the women. Then they\nwould sail away in their fast-sailing ships and when the soldiers\nof the king or emperor arrived upon the scene, the robbers\nwere gone and nothing remained but a few smouldering\nruins.",
        "During the days of disorder which followed the death of\nCharlemagne, the Northmen developed great activity. Their\nfleets made raids upon every country and their sailors established\nsmall independent kingdoms along the coast of Holland\nand France and England and Germany, and they even found\ntheir way into Italy. The Northmen were very intelligent\nThey soon learned to speak the language of their subjects and\ngave up the uncivilised ways of the early Vikings (or Sea-\nKings who had been very picturesque but also very unwashed\nand terribly cruel.",
        "Early in the tenth century a Viking by the name of Rollo\nhad repeatedly attacked the coast of France. The king of\nFrance, too weak to resist these northern robbers, tried to\nbribe them into “being good.” He offered them the province\nof Normandy, if they would promise to stop bothering the rest\nof his domains. Rollo accepted this bargain and became “Duke\nof Normandy.”",
        "But the passion of conquest was strong in the blood of his\nchildren. Across the channel, only a few hours away from the\nEuropean mainland, they could see the white cliffs and the\ngreen fields of England. Poor England had passed through\ndifficult days. For two hundred years it had been a Roman\ncolony. After the Romans left, it had been conquered by the\nAngles and the Saxons, two German tribes from Schleswig.\nNext the Danes had taken the greater part of the country\nand had established the kingdom of Cnut. The Danes had\nbeen driven away and now (it was early in the eleventh century)\nanother Saxon king, Edward the Confessor, was on the\nthrone. But Edward was not expected to live long and he\nhad no children. The circumstances favoured the ambitious\ndukes of Normandy.",

        "HOW CENTRAL EUROPE, ATTACKED FROM\nTHREE SIDES, BECAME AN ARMED CAMP\nAND WHY EUROPE WOULD HAVE PERISHED\nWITHOUT THOSE PROFESSIONAL\nSOLDIERS AND ADMINISTRATORS WHO\nWERE PART OF THE FEUDAL SYSTEM",
        "THE following, then, is the state of Europe in the year one\nthousand, when most people were so unhappy that they welcomed\nthe prophecy foretelling the approaching end of the\nworld and rushed to the monasteries, that the Day of Judgement\nmight find them engaged upon devout duties.",
        "At an unknown date, the Germanic tribes had left their old\nhome in Asia and had moved westward into Europe. By\nsheer pressure of numbers they had forced their way into the\nRoman Empire. They had destroyed the great western empire,\nbut the eastern part, being off the main route of the\ngreat migrations, had managed to survive and feebly continued\nthe traditions of Rome’s ancient glory.",
        "During the days of disorder which had followed, (the true\n\"dark ages” of history, the sixth and seventh centuries of our\nera,) the German tribes had been persuaded to accept the\nChristian religion and had recognised the Bishop of Rome\nas the Pope or spiritual head of the world. In the ninth century,\nthe organising genius of Charlemagne had revived the\nRoman Empire and had united the greater part of western\nEurope into a single state. During the tenth century this\nempire had gone to pieces. The western part had become a\nseparate kingdom, France. The eastern half was known as the\nHoly Roman Empire of the German nation, and the rulers of\nthis federation of states then pretended that they were the\ndirect heirs of Caesar and Augustus.",
        "Unfortunately the power of the kings of France did not\nstretch beyond the moat of their royal residence, while the\nHoly Roman Emperor was openly defied by his powerful\nsubjects whenever it suited their fancy or their profit.",
        "To increase the misery of the masses of the people, the\ntriangle of western Europe (look at page 128, please) was for ever\nexposed to attacks from three sides. On the south lived the\never dangerous Mohammedans. The western coast was ravaged\nby the Northmen. The eastern frontier (defenceless except\nfor the short stretch of the Carpathian mountains) was at\nthe mercy of hordes of Huns, Hungarians, Slavs and Tartars.",
        "The peace of Rome was a thing of the remote past, a dream\nof the “Good Old Days” that were gone for ever. It was a\nquestion of “fight or die,” and quite naturally people preferred\nto fight. Forced by circumstances, Europe became an armed\ncamp and there was a demand for strong leadership. Both\nKing and Emperor were far away. The frontiersmen (and\nmost of Europe in the year 1000 was “frontier”) must help\nthemselves. They willingly submitted to the representatives\nof the king who were sent to administer the outlying districts,\nPROVIDED THEY COULD PROTECT THEM AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES.",
        "Soon central Europe was dotted with small principalities,\neach one ruled by a duke or a count or a baron or a bishop, as\nthe case might be, and organised as a fighting unit. These\ndukes and counts and barons had sworn to be faithful to the\nking who had given them their “feudum” (hence our word\n\"feudal,”) in return for their loyal services and a certain\namount of taxes. But travel in those days was slow and the\nmeans of communication were exceedingly poor. The royal\nor imperial administrators therefore enjoyed great independence,\nand within the boundaries of their own province they\nassumed most of the rights which in truth belonged to the king.",
        "But you would make a mistake if you supposed that the\npeople of the eleventh century objected to this form of\ngovernment. They supported Feudalism because it was a very\npractical and necessary institution. Their Lord and Master\nusually lived in a big stone house erected on the top of a steep\nrock or built between deep moats, but within sight of his\nsubjects. In case of danger the subjects found shelter behind\nthe walls of the baronial stronghold. That is why they tried\nto live as near the castle as possible and it accounts for the\nmany European cities which began their career around a feudal\nfortress.",
        "But the knight of the early middle ages was much more\nthan a professional soldier. He was the civil servant of that\nday. He was the judge of his community and he was the\nchief of police. He caught the highwaymen and protected\nthe wandering pedlars who were the merchants of the eleventh\ncentury. He looked after the dikes so that the countryside\nshould not be flooded (just as the first noblemen had done\nin the valley of the Nile four thousand years before). He\nencouraged the Troubadours who wandered from place to place\ntelling the stories of the ancient heroes who had fought in the\ngreat wars of the migrations. Besides, he protected the churches\nand the monasteries within his territory, and although he could\nneither read nor write, (it was considered unmanly to know\nsuch things,) he employed a number of priests who kept his\naccounts and who registered the marriages and the births and\nthe deaths which occurred within the baronial or ducal domains.",
        "In the fifteenth century the kings once more became strong\nenough to exercise those powers which belonged to them because\nthey were “anointed of God.” Then the feudal knights lost\ntheir former independence. Reduced to the rank of country\nsquires, they no longer filled a need and soon they became a\nnuisance. But Europe would have perished without the “feudal\nsystem” of the dark ages. There were many bad knights\nas there are many bad people to-day. But generally speaking,\nthe rough-fisted barons of the twelfth and thirteenth century\nwere hard-working administrators who rendered a most useful\nservice to the cause of progress. During that era the noble\ntorch of learning and art which had illuminated the world of\nthe Egyptians and the Greeks and the Romans was burning\nvery low. Without the knights and their good friends, the\nmonks, civilisation would have been extinguished entirely, and\nthe human race would have been forced to begin once more\nwhere the cave-man had left off.",
        "CHIVALRY",
        "IT was quite natural that the professional fighting-men of\nthe Middle Ages should try to establish some sort of organisation\nfor their mutual benefit and protection. Out of this need\nfor close organisation, Knighthood or Chivalry was born.",
        "We know very little about the origins of Knighthood. But\nas the system developed, it gave the world something which it\nneeded very badly–a definite rule of conduct which softened\nthe barbarous customs of that day and made life more livable\nthan it had been during the five hundred years of the Dark\nAges. It was not an easy task to civilise the rough frontiersmen\nwho had spent most of their time fighting Mohammedans\nand Huns and Norsemen. Often they were guilty of backsliding,\nand having vowed all sorts of oaths about mercy and\ncharity in the morning, they would murder all their prisoners\nbefore evening. But progress is ever the result of slow and\nceaseless labour, and finally the most unscrupulous of knights\nwas forced to obey the rules of his “class” or suffer the consequences.",
        "These rules were different in the various parts of Europe,\nbut they all made much of “service” and “loyalty to duty.” The\nMiddle Ages regarded service as something very noble and\nbeautiful. It was no disgrace to be a servant, provided you\nwere a good servant and did not slacken on the job. As for\nloyalty, at a time when life depended upon the faithful per-\nformance of many unpleasant duties, it was the chief virtue\nof the fighting man.",
        "A young knight therefore was asked to swear that he would\nbe faithful as a servant to God and as a servant to his King.\nFurthermore, he promised to be generous to those whose need\nwas greater than his own. He pledged his word that he would\nbe humble in his personal behaviour and would never boast of\nhis own accomplishments and that he would be a friend of all\nthose who suffered, (with the exception of the Mohammedans,\nwhom he was expected to kill on sight).",
        "Around these vows, which were merely the Ten Commandments\nexpressed in terms which the people of the Middle Ages\ncould understand, there developed a complicated system of\nmanners and outward behaviour. The knights tried to model\ntheir own lives after the example of those heroes of Arthur’s\nRound Table and Charlemagne’s court of whom the Troubadours\nhad told them and of whom you may read in many delightful\nbooks which are enumerated at the end of this volume.\nThey hoped that they might prove as brave as Lancelot and\nas faithful as Roland. They carried themselves with dignity\nand they spoke careful and gracious words that they might be\nknown as True Knights, however humble the cut of their coat\nor the size of their purse.",
        "In this way the order of Knighthood became a school of those\ngood manners which are the oil of the social machinery. Chivalry\ncame to mean courtesy and the feudal castle showed the\nrest of the world what clothes to wear, how to eat, how to ask\na lady for a dance and the thousand and one little things of\nevery-day behaviour which help to make life interesting and\nagreeable.",
        "Like all human institutions, Knighthood was doomed to\nperish as soon as it had outlived its usefulness.",
        "The crusades, about which one of the next chapters tells,\nwere followed by a great revival of trade. Cities grew overnight.\nThe townspeople became rich, hired good school teachers\nand soon were the equals of the knights. The invention\nof gun-powder deprived the heavily armed “Chevalier” of his\nformer advantage and the use of mercenaries made it impossible\nto conduct a battle with the delicate niceties of a chess\ntournament. The knight became superfluous. Soon he became\na ridiculous figure, with his devotion to ideals that had no\nlonger any practical value. It was said that the noble Don\nQuixote de la Mancha had been the last of the true knights.\nAfter his death, his trusted sword and his armour were sold\nto pay his debts.",
        "But somehow or other that sword seems to have fallen into\nthe hands of a number of men. Washington carried it during\nthe hopeless days of Valley Forge. It was the only defence\nof Gordon, when he had refused to desert the people who had\nbeen entrusted to his care, and stayed to meet his death in the\nbesieged fortress of Khartoum.",

Your own grandfather, whom you see every day, is a\nmysterious being who lives in a different world of ideas and\nclothes and manners. I am now telling you the story of some\nof your grandfathers who are twenty-five generations removed,\nand I do not expect you to catch the meaning of what I write\nwithout re-reading this chapter a number of times.",
        "The average man of the Middle Ages lived a very simple\nand uneventful life. Even if he was a free citizen, able to\ncome and go at will, he rarely left his own neighbourhood.\nThere were no printed books and only a few manuscripts.\nHere and there, a small band of industrious monks taught\nreading and writing and some arithmetic. But science and history\nand geography lay buried beneath the ruins of Greece and\nRome.",
        "Whatever people knew about the past they had learned by\nlistening to stories and legends. Such information, which goes\nfrom father to son, is often slightly incorrect in details, but\nit will preserve the main facts of history with astonishing\naccuracy. After more than two thousand years, the mothers of\nIndia still frighten their naughty children by telling them that\n\"Iskander will get them,” and Iskander is none other than\nAlexander the Great, who visited India in the year 330 before\nthe birth of Christ, but whose story has lived through all these\nages.",
        "The people of the early Middle Ages never saw a textbook\nof Roman history. They were ignorant of many things\nwhich every school-boy to-day knows before he has entered\nthe third grade. But the Roman Empire, which is merely a\nname to you, was to them something very much alive. They\nfelt it. They willingly recognised the Pope as their spiritual\nleader because he lived in Rome and represented the idea of\nthe Roman super-power. And they were profoundly grateful\nwhen Charlemagne, and afterwards Otto the Great, revived\nthe idea of a world-empire and created the Holy Roman\nEmpire, that the world might again be as it always had been.",
        "But the fact that there were two different heirs to the\nRoman tradition placed the faithful burghers of the Middle\nAges in a difficult position. The theory behind the mediaeval\npolitical system was both sound and simple. While the worldly\nmaster (the emperor) looked after the physical well-being of\nhis subjects, the spiritual master (the Pope) guarded their\nsouls.",
        "In practice, however, the system worked very badly. The\nEmperor invariably tried to interfere with the affairs of the\nchurch and the Pope retaliated and told the Emperor how\nhe should rule his domains. Then they told each other to mind\ntheir own business in very unceremonious language and the\ninevitable end was war.",
        "Under those circumstances, what were the people to do,\nA good Christian obeyed both the Pope and his King. But\nthe Pope and the Emperor were enemies. Which side should\na dutiful subject and an equally dutiful Christian take?",
        "It was never easy to give the correct answer. When the\nEmperor happened to be a man of energy and was sufficiently\nwell provided with money to organise an army, he was very\napt to cross the Alps and march on Rome, besiege the Pope\nin his own palace if need be, and force His Holiness to obey\nthe imperial instructions or suffer the consequences.",
        "But more frequently the Pope was the stronger. Then the\nEmperor or the King together with all his subjects was\nexcommunicated. This meant that all churches were closed, that no\none could be baptised, that no dying man could be given absolution–\nin short, that half of the functions of mediaeval government\ncame to an end.",
        "More than that, the people were absolved from their oath of\nloyalty to their sovereign and were urged to rebel against their\nmaster. But if they followed this advice of the distant Pope\nand were caught, they were hanged by their near-by Lege\nLord and that too was very unpleasant.",
        "Indeed, the poor fellows were in a difficult position and\nnone fared worse than those who lived during the latter half of\nthe eleventh century, when the Emperor Henry IV of Germany\nand Pope Gregory VII fought a two-round battle which\ndecided nothing and upset the peace of Europe for almost fifty\nyears.",
        "In the middle of the eleventh century there had been a\nstrong movement for reform in the church. The election of the\nPopes, thus far, had been a most irregular affair. It was to the\nadvantage of the Holy Roman Emperors to have a well-disposed\npriest elected to the Holy See. They frequently came\nto Rome at the time of election and used their influence for\nthe benefit of one of their friends.",
        "In the year 1059 this had been changed. By a decree of\nPope Nicholas II the principal priests and deacons of the\nchurches in and around Rome were organised into the so-\ncalled College of Cardinals, and this gathering of prominent\nchurchmen (the word “Cardinal” meant principal) was given\nthe exclusive power of electing the future Popes.",
        "In the year 1073 the College of Cardinals elected a priest\nby the name of Hildebrand, the son of very simple parents in\nTuscany, as Pope, and he took the name of Gregory VII.\nHis energy was unbounded. His belief in the supreme powers\nof his Holy Office was built upon a granite rock of conviction\nand courage. In the mind of Gregory, the Pope was not only\nthe absolute head of the Christian church, but also the highest\nCourt of Appeal in all worldly matters. The Pope who had\nelevated simple German princes to the dignity of Emperor\ncould depose them at will. He could veto any law passed by\nduke or king or emperor, but whosoever should question a\npapal decree, let him beware, for the punishment would be\nswift and merciless.",
        "Gregory sent ambassadors to all the European courts to\ninform the potentates of Europe of his new laws and asked\nthem to take due notice of their contents. William the Conqueror\npromised to be good, but Henry IV, who since the age\nof six had been fighting with his subjects, had no intention of\nsubmitting to the Papal will. He called together a college of\nGerman bishops, accused Gregory of every crime under the\nsun and then had him deposed by the council of Worms.",
        "The Pope answered with excommunication and a demand\nthat the German princes rid themselves of their unworthy ruler.\nThe German princes, only too happy to be rid of Henry, asked\nthe Pope to come to Augsburg and help them elect a new Emperor.",
        "Gregory left Rome and travelled northward. Henry,\nwho was no fool, appreciated the danger of his position. At\nall costs he must make peace with the Pope, and he must do\nit at once. In the midst of winter he crossed the Alps and\nhastened to Canossa where the Pope had stopped for a short\nrest. Three long days, from the 25th to the 28th of January\nof the year 1077, Henry, dressed as a penitent pilgrim\n(but with a warm sweater underneath his monkish garb),\nwaited outside the gates of the castle of Canossa.\nThen he was allowed to enter and was pardoned for\nhis sins. But the repentance did not last long.\nAs soon as Henry had returned to Germany, he behaved\nexactly as before. Again he was excommunicated. For the\nsecond time a council of German bishops deposed Gregory,\nbut this time, when Henry crossed the Alps he was at\nthe head of a large army, besieged Rome and forced Gregory\nto retire to Salerno, where he died in exile. This first violent\noutbreak decided nothing. As soon as Henry was back in\nGermany, the struggle between Pope and Emperor was continued.",
        "The Hohenstaufen family which got hold of the Imperial\nGerman Throne shortly afterwards, were even more independent\nthan their predecessors. Gregory had claimed that the\nPopes were superior to all kings because they (the Popes) at\nthe Day of Judgement would be responsible for the behaviour\nof all the sheep of their flock, and in the eyes of God, a king\nwas one of that faithful herd.",
        "Frederick of Hohenstaufen, commonly known as Barbarossa\nor Red Beard, set up the counter-claim that the Empire\nhad been bestowed upon his predecessor “by God himself\"\nand as the Empire included Italy and Rome, he began a campaign\nwhich was to add these “lost provinces” to the northern\ncountry. Barbarossa was accidentally drowned in Asia Minor\nduring the second Crusade, but his son Frederick II, a brilliant\nyoung man who in his youth had been exposed to the civilisation\nof the Mohammedans of Sicily, continued the war. The\nPopes accused him of heresy. It is true that Frederick seems\nto have felt a deep and serious contempt for the rough Christian\nworld of the North, for the boorish German Knights and\nthe intriguing Italian priests. But he held his tongue, went\non a Crusade and took Jerusalem from the infidel and was\nduly crowned as King of the Holy City. Even this act did not\nplacate the Popes. They deposed Frederick and gave his\nItalian possessions to Charles of Anjou, the brother of that\nKing Louis of France who became famous as Saint Louis.\nThis led to more warfare. Conrad V, the son of Conrad IV,\nand the last of the Hohenstaufens, tried to regain the kingdom,\nand was defeated and decapitated at Naples. But twenty years\nlater, the French who had made themselves thoroughly unpopular\nin Sicily were all murdered during the so-called Sicilian\nVespers, and so it went.",
        "The quarrel between the Popes and the Emperors was\nnever settled, but after a while the two enemies learned to\nleave each other alone.",
        "In the year 1278, Rudolph of Hapsburg was elected Emperor.\nHe did not take the trouble to go to Rome to be\ncrowned. The Popes did not object and in turn they kept\naway from Germany. This meant peace but two entire centuries\nwhich might have been used for the purpose of internal\norganisation had been wasted in useless warfare.",
        "It is an ill wind however that bloweth no good to some one.\nThe little cities of Italy, by a process of careful balancing,\nhad managed to increase their power and their independence\nat the expense of both Emperors and Popes. When the rush\nfor the Holy Land began, they were able to handle the transportation\nproblem of the thousands of eager pilgrims who were\nclamoring for passage, and at the end of the Crusades they\nhad built themselves such strong defences of brick and of gold\nthat they could defy Pope and Emperor with equal indifference.",
        "Church and State fought each other and a third party–the\nmediaeval city–ran away with the spoils.",
        "BUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT QUARRELS\nWERE FORGOTTEN WHEN THE TURKS\nTOOK THE HOLY LAND, DESECRATED THE\nHOLY PLACES AND INTERFERED SERIOUSLY\nWITH THE TRADE FROM EAST TO\nWEST. EUROPE WENT CRUSADING",
        "DURING three centuries there had been peace between Christians\nand Moslems except in Spain and in the eastern Roman\nEmpire, the two states defending the gateways of Europe.\nThe Mohammedans having conquered Syria in the seventh\ncentury were in possession of the Holy Land. But they regarded\nJesus as a great prophet (though not quite as great\nas Mohammed), and they did not interfere with the pilgrims\nwho wished to pray in the church which Saint Helena, the\nmother of the Emperor Constantine, had built on the spot of\nthe Holy Grave. But early in the eleventh century, a Tartar\ntribe from the wilds of Asia, called the Seljuks or Turks,\nbecame masters of the Mohammedan state in western Asia and\nthen the period of tolerance came to an end. The Turks took\nall of Asia Minor away from the eastern Roman Emperors\nand they made an end to the trade between east and west.",
        "Alexis, the Emperor, who rarely saw anything of his Christian\nneighbours of the west, appealed for help and pointed to\nthe danger which threatened Europe should the Turks take\nConstantinople.",
        "The Italian cities which had established colonies along the\ncoast of Asia Minor and Palestine, in fear for their possessions,\nreported terrible stories of Turkish atrocities and Christian\nsuffering. All Europe got excited.",
        "Pope Urban II, a Frenchman from Reims, who had been\neducated at the same famous cloister of Cluny which had\ntrained Gregory VII, thought that the time had come for\naction. The general state of Europe was far from satisfactory.\nThe primitive agricultural methods of that day (unchanged\nsince Roman times) caused a constant scarcity of food. There\nwas unemployment and hunger and these are apt to lead to\ndiscontent and riots. Western Asia in older days had fed millions.\nIt was an excellent field for the purpose of immigration.",
        "Therefore at the council of Clermont in France in the year\n1095 the Pope arose, described the terrible horrors which the\ninfidels had inflicted upon the Holy Land, gave a glowing\ndescription of this country which ever since the days of Moses\nhad been overflowing with milk and honey, and exhorted the\nknights of France and the people of Europe in general to\nleave wife and child and deliver Palestine from the Turks.",
        "A wave of religious hysteria swept across the continent.\nAll reason stopped. Men would drop their hammer and saw,\nwalk out of their shop and take the nearest road to the east\nto go and kill Turks. Children would leave their homes to “go\nto Palestine” and bring the terrible Turks to their knees by\nthe mere appeal of their youthful zeal and Christian piety.\nFully ninety percent of those enthusiasts never got within\nsight of the Holy Land. They had no money. They were\nforced to beg or steal to keep alive. They became a danger\nto the safety of the highroads and they were killed by the\nangry country people.",
        "The first Crusade, a wild mob of honest Christians, defaulting\nbankrupts, penniless noblemen and fugitives from justice,\nfollowing the lead of half-crazy Peter the Hermit and Walter-\nwithout-a-Cent, began their campaign against the Infidels by\nmurdering all the Jews whom they met by the way. They\ngot as far as Hungary and then they were all killed.",
        "This experience taught the Church a lesson. Enthusiasm\nalone would not set the Holy Land free. Organisation was\nas necessary as good-will and courage. A year was spent in\ntraining and equipping an army of 200,000 men. They were\nplaced under command of Godfrey of Bouillon, Robert, duke\nof Normandy, Robert, count of Flanders, and a number of\nother noblemen, all experienced in the art of war.",
        "In the year 1096 this second crusade started upon its long\nvoyage. At Constantinople the knights did homage to the\nEmperor. (For as I have told you, traditions die hard, and\na Roman Emperor, however poor and powerless, was still held\nin great respect). Then they crossed into Asia, killed all the\nMoslems who fell into their hands, stormed Jerusalem, massacred\nthe Mohammedan population, and marched to the Holy\nSepulchre to give praise and thanks amidst tears of piety and\ngratitude. But soon the Turks were strengthened by the arrival\nof fresh troops. Then they retook Jerusalem and in turn\nkilled the faithful followers of the Cross.",
        "During the next two centuries, seven other crusades took\nplace. Gradually the Crusaders learned the technique of the\ntrip. The land voyage was too tedious and too dangerous.\nThey preferred to cross the Alps and go to Genoa or Venice\nwhere they took ship for the east. The Genoese and the Venetians\nmade this trans-Mediterranean passenger service a very\nprofitable business. They charged exorbitant rates, and when\nthe Crusaders (most of whom had very little money) could not\npay the price, these Italian “profiteers” kindly allowed them\nto “work their way across.” In return for a fare from Venice\nto Acre, the Crusader undertook to do a stated amount of\nfighting for the owners of his vessel. In this way Venice greatly\nincreased her territory along the coast of the Adriatic and in\nGreece, where Athens became a Venetian colony, and in the\nislands of Cyprus and Crete and Rhodes.",
        "All this, however, helped little in settling the question\nof the Holy Land. After the first enthusiasm had\nworn off, a short crusading trip became part of the liberal\neducation of every well-bred young man, and there\nnever was any lack of candidates for service in Palestine.\nBut the old zeal was gone. The Crusaders, who\nhad begun their warfare with deep hatred for the\nMohammedans and great love for the Christian people\nof the eastern Roman Empire and Armenia, suffered\na complete change of heart. They came to despise the\nGreeks of Byzantium, who cheated them and frequently betrayed\nthe cause of the Cross, and the Armenians and all the\nother Levantine races, and they began to appreciate the vir-\ntues of their enemies who proved to be generous and fair\nopponents.",
        "Of course, it would never do to say this openly. But when\nthe Crusader returned home, he was likely to imitate the manners\nwhich he had learned from his heathenish foe, compared\nto whom the average western knight was still a good deal of a\ncountry bumpkin. He also brought with him several new\nfood-stuffs, such as peaches and spinach which he planted in his\ngarden and grew for his own benefit. He gave up the barbarous\ncustom of wearing a load of heavy armour and appeared\nin the flowing robes of silk or cotton which were the traditional\nhabit of the followers of the Prophet and were originally worn\nby the Turks. Indeed the Crusades, which had begun as a\npunitive expedition against the Heathen, became a course of\ngeneral instruction in civilisation for millions of young Europeans.",
        "From a military and political point of view the Crusades\nwere a failure. Jerusalem and a number of cities were taken\nand lost. A dozen little kingdoms were established in Syria\nand Palestine and Asia Minor, but they were re-conquered by\nthe Turks and after the year 1244 (when Jerusalem became\ndefinitely Turkish) the status of the Holy Land was the same\nas it had been before 1095.",
        "But Europe had undergone a great change. The people of\nthe west had been allowed a glimpse of the light and the sunshine\nand the beauty of the east. Their dreary castles no\nlonger satisfied them. They wanted a broader life. Neither\nChurch nor State could give this to them.",
        "They found it in the cities.",
        "WHY THE PEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE AGES\nSAID THAT “CITY AIR IS FREE AIR”",
        "THE early part of the Middle Ages had been an era of\npioneering and of settlement. A new people, who thus far\nhad lived outside the wild range of forest, mountains and\nmarshes which protected the north-eastern frontier of the Roman\nEmpire, had forced its way into the plains of western\nEurope and had taken possession of most of the land. They\nwere restless, as all pioneers have been since the beginning of\ntime. They liked to be “on the go.” They cut down the\nforests and they cut each other’s throats with equal energy.\nFew of them wanted to live in cities. They insisted upon being\n\"free,” they loved to feel the fresh air of the hillsides fill their\nlungs while they drove their herds across the wind-swept pastures.\nWhen they no longer liked their old homes, they pulled\nup stakes and went away in search of fresh adventures.",
        "The weaker ones died. The hardy fighters and the courageous\nwomen who had followed their men into the wilderness\nsurvived. In this way they developed a strong race of\nmen. They cared little for the graces of life. They were too\nbusy to play the fiddle or write pieces of poetry. They had\nlittle love for discussions. The priest, “the learned man” of the\nvillage (and before the middle of the thirteenth century, a layman\nwho could read and write was regarded as a “sissy”) was\nsupposed to settle all questions which had no direct practical\nvalue. Meanwhile the German chieftain, the Frankish Baron,\nthe Northman Duke (or whatever their names and titles) occupied\ntheir share of the territory which once had been part of\nthe great Roman Empire and among the ruins of past glory,\nthey built a world of their own which pleased them mightily\nand which they considered quite perfect.",
        "They managed the affairs of their castle and the surrounding\ncountry to the best of their ability. They were as faithful\nto the commandments of the Church as any weak mortal could\nhope to be. They were sufficiently loyal to their king or emperor\nto keep on good terms with those distant but always dangerous\npotentates. In short, they tried to do right and to be\nfair to their neighbours without being exactly unfair to their\nown interests.",
        "It was not an ideal world in which they found themselves.\nThe greater part of the people were serfs or “villains,” farm-\nhands who were as much a part of the soil upon which they\nlived as the cows and sheep whose stables they shared. Their\nfate was not particularly happy nor was it particularly\nunhappy. But what was one to do? The good Lord who ruled\nthe world of the Middle Ages had undoubtedly ordered everything\nfor the best. If He, in his wisdom, had decided that\nthere must be both knights and serfs, it was not the duty of\nthese faithful sons of the church to question the arrangement.\nThe serfs therefore did not complain but when they were too\nhard driven, they would die off like cattle which are not fed\nand stabled in the right way, and then something would be hastily\ndone to better their condition. But if the progress of the\nworld had been left to the serf and his feudal master, we would\nstill be living after the fashion of the twelfth century, saying\n\"abracadabra” when we tried to stop a tooth-ache, and feeling\na deep contempt and hatred for the dentist who offered to help\nus with his “science,” which most likely was of Mohammedan\nor heathenish origin and therefore both wicked and useless.",
        "When you grow up you will discover that many people do\nnot believe in “progress” and they will prove to you by the\nterrible deeds of some of our own contemporaries that “the\nworld does not change.” But I hope that you will not pay\nmuch attention to such talk. You see, it took our ancestors\nalmost a million years to learn how to walk on their hind legs.\nOther centuries had to go by before their animal-like grunts\ndeveloped into an understandable language. Writing–the art\nof preserving our ideas for the benefit of future generations,\nwithout which no progress is possible was invented only four\nthousand years ago. The idea of turning the forces of nature\ninto the obedient servants of man was quite new in the days of\nyour own grandfather. It seems to me, therefore, that we are\nmaking progress at an unheard-of rate of speed. Perhaps we\nhave paid a little too much attention to the mere physical comforts\nof life. That will change in due course of time and we\nshall then attack the problems which are not related to health\nand to wages and plumbing and machinery in general.",
        "But please do not be too sentimental about the “good old\ndays.” Many people who only see the beautiful churches and\nthe great works of art which the Middle Ages have left behind\ngrow quite eloquent when they compare our own ugly civilisation\nwith its hurry and its noise and the evil smells of backfiring\nmotor trucks with the cities of a thousand years ago.\nBut these mediaeval churches were invariably surrounded by\nmiserable hovels compared to which a modern tenement house\nstands forth as a luxurious palace. It is true that the noble\nLancelot and the equally noble Parsifal, the pure young hero\nwho went in search of the Holy Grail, were not bothered by\nthe odor of gasoline. But there were other smells of the barnyard\nvariety–odors of decaying refuse which had been thrown\ninto the street–of pig-sties surrounding the Bishop’s palace–\nof unwashed people who had inherited their coats and hats\nfrom their grandfathers and who had never learned the blessing\nof soap. I do not want to paint too unpleasant a picture.\nBut when you read in the ancient chronicles that the King of\nFrance, looking out of the windows of his palace, fainted at\nthe stench caused by the pigs rooting in the streets of Paris,\nwhen an ancient manuscript recounts a few details of an epidemic\nof the plague or of small-pox, then you begin to under-\nstand that “progress” is something more than a catchword used\nby modern advertising men.",
        "No, the progress of the last six hundred years would not\nhave been possible without the existence of cities. I shall,\ntherefore, have to make this chapter a little longer than many\nof the others. It is too important to be reduced to three or\nfour pages, devoted to mere political events.",
        "The ancient world of Egypt and Babylonia and Assyria\nhad been a world of cities. Greece had been a country of City-\nStates. The history of Phoenicia was the history of two cities\ncalled Sidon and Tyre. The Roman Empire was the “hinterland\"\nof a single town. Writing, art, science, astronomy, architecture,\nliterature, the theatre–the list is endless–have all\nbeen products of the city.",
        "For almost four thousand years the wooden bee-hive which\nwe call a town had been the workshop of the world. Then came\nthe great migrations. The Roman Empire was destroyed.\nThe cities were burned down and Europe once more became a\nland of pastures and little agricultural villages. During the\nDark Ages the fields of civilisation had lain fallow.",
        "The Crusades had prepared the soil for a new crop. It\nwas time for the harvest, but the fruit was plucked by the\nburghers of the free cities.",
        "I have told you the story of the castles and the monasteries,\nwith their heavy stone enclosures–the homes of the knights\nand the monks, who guarded men’s bodies and their souls.\nYou have seen how a few artisans (butchers and bakers and an\noccasional candle-stick maker) came to live near the castle\nto tend to the wants of their masters and to find protection\nin case of danger. Sometimes the feudal lord allowed these\npeople to surround their houses with a stockade. But they\nwere dependent for their living upon the good-will of the\nmighty Seigneur of the castle. When he went about they knelt\nbefore him and kissed his hand.",
        "Then came the Crusades and many things changed. The\nmigrations had driven people from the north-east to the west.\nThe Crusades made millions of people travel from the west to\nthe highly civilised regions of the south-east. They discovered\nthat the world was not bounded by the four walls of their little\nsettlement. They came to appreciate better clothes, more\ncomfortable houses, new dishes, products of the mysterious Orient.\nAfter their return to their old homes, they insisted that they\nbe supplied with those articles. The peddler with his pack\nupon his back–the only merchant of the Dark Ages–added\nthese goods to his old merchandise, bought a cart, hired a few\nex-crusaders to protect him against the crime wave which\nfollowed this great international war, and went forth to do\nbusiness upon a more modern and larger scale. His career was\nnot an easy one. Every time he entered the domains of another\nLord he had to pay tolls and taxes. But the business\nwas profitable all the same and the peddler continued to make\nhis rounds.",
        "Soon certain energetic merchants discovered that the goods\nwhich they had always imported from afar could be made at\nhome. They turned part of their homes into a workgshop.{sic}\nThey ceased to be merchants and became manufacturers. They\nsold their products not only to the lord of the castle and to the\nabbot in his monastery, but they exported them to nearby towns.\nThe lord and the abbot paid them with products of their farms,\neggs and wines, and with honey, which in those early days was\nused as sugar. But the citizens of distant towns were obliged\nto pay in cash and the manufacturer and the merchant began to\nown little pieces of gold, which entirely changed their position\nin the society of the early Middle Ages.",
        "It is difficult for you to imagine a world without money.\nIn a modern city one cannot possible live without money. All\nday long you carry a pocket full of small discs of metal to\n\"pay your way.” You need a nickel for the street-car, a dollar\nfor a dinner, three cents for an evening paper. But many\npeople of the early Middle Ages never saw a piece of coined\nmoney from the time they were born to the day of their death.\nThe gold and silver of Greece and Rome lay buried beneath\nthe ruins of their cities. The world of the migrations, which\nhad succeeded the Empire, was an agricultural world. Every\nfarmer raised enough grain and enough sheep and enough\ncows for his own use.",
        "The mediaeval knight was a country squire and was rarely\nforced to pay for materials in money. His estates produced\neverything that he and his family ate and drank and wore on\ntheir backs. The bricks for his house were made along the\nbanks of the nearest river. Wood for the rafters of the hall\nwas cut from the baronial forest. The few articles that had to\ncome from abroad were paid for in goods–in honey–in eggs\n–in fagots.",
        "But the Crusades upset the routine of the old agricultural\nlife in a very drastic fashion. Suppose that the Duke of Hildesheim\nwas going to the Holy Land. He must travel thousands\nof miles and he must pay his passage and his hotel-bills.\nAt home he could pay with products of his farm. But he\ncould not well take a hundred dozen eggs and a cart-load of\nhams with him to satisfy the greed of the shipping agent of\nVenice or the inn-keeper of the Brenner Pass. These gentlemen\ninsisted upon cash. His Lordship therefore was obliged\nto take a small quantity of gold with him upon his voyage.\nWhere could he find this gold? He could borrow it from the\nLombards, the descendants of the old Longobards, who had\nturned professional money-lenders, who seated behind their\nexchange-table (commonly known as “banco” or bank) were\nglad to let his Grace have a few hundred gold pieces in exchange\nfor a mortgage upon his estates, that they might be repaid\nin case His Lordship should die at the hands of the Turks.",
        "That was dangerous business for the borrower. In the end,\nthe Lombards invariably owned the estates and the Knight\nbecame a bankrupt, who hired himself out as a fighting man to\na more powerful and more careful neighbour.",
        "His Grace could also go to that part of the town where the\nJews were forced to live. There he could borrow money at a\nrate of fifty or sixty percent. interest. That, too, was bad\nbusiness. But was there a way out? Some of the people of the\nlittle city which surrounded the castle were said to have money.\nThey had known the young lord all his life. His father and\ntheir fathers had been good friends. They would not be\nunreasonable in their demands. Very well. His Lordship’s\nclerk, a monk who could write and keep accounts, sent a note\nto the best known merchants and asked for a small loan. The\ntownspeople met in the work-room of the jeweller who made\nchalices for the nearby churches and discussed this demand.\nThey could not well refuse. It would serve no purpose to\nask for “interest.” In the first place, it was against the\nreligious principles of most people to take interest and in the\nsecond place, it would never be paid except in agricultural\nproducts and of these the people had enough and to spare.",
        "“But,” suggested the tailor who spent his days quietly sitting\nupon his table and who was somewhat of a philosopher,\n\"suppose that we ask some favour in return for our money.\nWe are all fond of fishing. But his Lordship won’t let us\nfish in his brook. Suppose that we let him have a hundred\nducats and that he give us in return a written guarantee allowing\nus to fish all we want in all of his rivers. Then he gets\nthe hundred which he needs, but we get the fish and it will be\ngood business all around.”",
        "The day his Lordship accepted this proposition (it seemed\nsuch an easy way of getting a hundred gold pieces) he signed\nthe death-warrant of his own power. His clerk drew up the\nagreement. His Lordship made his mark (for he could not\nsign his name) and departed for the East. Two years later\nhe came back, dead broke. The townspeople were fishing in\nthe castle pond. The sight of this silent row of anglers annoyed\nhis Lordship. He told his equerry to go and chase the crowd\naway. They went, but that night a delegation of merchants\nvisited the castle. They were very polite. They congratulated\nhis Lordship upon his safe return. They were sorry his\nLordship had been annoyed by the fishermen, but as his Lordship\nmight perhaps remember he had given them permission\nto do so himself, and the tailor produced the Charter which\nhad been kept in the safe of the jeweller ever since the master\nhad gone to the Holy Land.",
        "His Lordship was much annoyed. But once more he was\nin dire need of some money. In Italy he had signed his name\nto certain documents which were now in the possession of Salvestro\ndei Medici, the well-known banker. These documents\nwere “promissory notes” and they were due two months from\ndate. Their total amount came to three hundred and forty\npounds, Flemish gold. Under these circumstances, the noble\nknight could not well show the rage which filled his heart and\nhis proud soul. Instead, he suggested another little loan. The\nmerchants retired to discuss the matter.",
        "After three days they came back and said “yes.” They\nwere only too happy to be able to help their master in his\ndifficulties, but in return for the 345 golden pounds would he give\nthem another written promise (another charter) that they,\nthe townspeople, might establish a council of their own to be\nelected by all the merchants and free citizens of the city, said\ncouncil to manage civic affairs without interference from the\nside of the castle?",
        "His Lordship was confoundedly angry. But again,\nhe needed the money. He said yes, and signed the charter.\nNext week, he repented. He called his soldiers and went to\nthe house of the jeweller and asked for the documents which\nhis crafty subjects had cajoled out of him under the pressure\nof circumstances. He took them away and burned them.\nThe townspeople stood by and said nothing. But when next\nhis Lordship needed money to pay for the dowry of his daughter.\nhe was unable to get a single penny. After that little\naffair at the jeweller’s his credit was not considered good.\nHe was forced to eat humble-pie and offer to make certain reparations.\nBefore his Lordship got the first installment of the stipulated sum,\nthe townspeople were once more in possession of all their old charters\nand a brand new one which permitted them to build a “city-hall\"\nand a strong tower where all the charters might be kept protected\nagainst fire and theft, which really meant protected against\nfuture violence on the part of the Lord and his armed followers.",
        "This, in a very general way, is what happened during the\ncenturies which followed the Crusades. It was a slow process,\nthis gradual shifting of power from the castle to the city. There\nwas some fighting. A few tailors and jewellers were killed and\na few castles went up in smoke. But such occurrences were\nnot common. Almost imperceptibly the towns grew richer\nand the feudal lords grew poorer. To maintain themselves\nthey were for ever forced to exchange charters of civic liberty\nin return for ready cash. The cities grew. They offered an\nasylum to run-away serfs who gained their liberty after they\nhad lived a number of years behind the city walls. They came\nto be the home of the more energetic elements of the\nsurrounding country districts. They were proud of\ntheir new importance and expressed their power in the\nchurches and public buildings which they erected\naround the old market place, where centuries before\nthe barter of eggs and sheep and honey and salt\nhad taken place. They wanted their children to\nhave a better chance in life than they had enjoyed\nthemselves. They hired monks to come to their city and\nbe school teachers. When they heard of a man who could\npaint pictures upon boards of wood, they offered him a pension\nif he would come and cover the walls of their chapels and their\ntown hall with scenes from the Holy Scriptures.",
        "Meanwhile his Lordship, in the dreary and drafty halls of\nhis castle, saw all this up-start splendour and regretted the\nday when first he had signed away a single one of his sovereign\nrights and prerogatives. But he was helpless. The townspeople\nwith their well-filled strong-boxes snapped their fingers\nat him. They were free men, fully prepared to hold what they\nhad gained by the sweat of their brow and after a struggle\nwhich had lasted for more than ten generations.",
        "HOW THE PEOPLE OF THE CITIES ASSERTED\nTHEIR RIGHT TO BE HEARD IN THE\nROYAL COUNCILS OF THEIR COUNTRY",
        "As long as people were “nomads,” wandering tribes of shepherds,\nall men had been equal and had been responsible for the\nwelfare and safety of the entire community.",
        "But after they had settled down and some had become rich\nand others had grown poor, the government was apt to fall into\nthe hands of those who were not obliged to work for their living\nand who could devote themselves to politics.",
        "I have told you how this had happened in Egypt and in\nMesopotamia and in Greece and in Rome. It occurred among\nthe Germanic population of western Europe as soon as order\nhad been restored. The western European world was ruled\nin the first place by an emperor who was elected by the seven\nor eight most important kings of the vast Roman Empire of\nthe German nation and who enjoyed a great deal of imaginary\nand very little actual power. It was ruled by a number of\nkings who sat upon shaky thrones. The every-day government\nwas in the hands of thousands of feudal princelets. Their\nsubjects were peasants or serfs. There were few cities. There\nwas hardly any middle class. But during the thirteenth century\n(after an absence of almost a thousand years) the middle\nclass–the merchant class–once more appeared upon the his-\ntorical stage and its rise in power, as we saw in the last chapter,\nhad meant a decrease in the influence of the castle folk.",
        "Thus far, the king, in ruling his domains, had only paid\nattention to the wishes of his noblemen and his bishops. But the\nnew world of trade and commerce which grew out of the\nCrusades forced him to recognise the middle class or suffer\nfrom an ever-increasing emptiness of his exchequer. Their\nmajesties (if they had followed their hidden wishes) would\nhave as lief consulted their cows and their pigs as the good\nburghers of their cities. But they could not help themselves.\nThey swallowed the bitter pill because it was gilded, but not\nwithout a struggle.",
        "In England, during the absence of Richard the Lion\nHearted (who had gone to the Holy Land, but who was spending\nthe greater part of his crusading voyage in an Austrian\njail) the government of the country had been placed in the\nhands of John, a brother of Richard, who was his inferior in\nthe art of war, but his equal as a bad administrator. John had\nbegun his career as a regent by losing Normandy and the\ngreater part of the French possessions. Next, he had managed\nto get into a quarrel with Pope Innocent III, the famous\nenemy of the Hohenstaufens. The Pope had excommunicated\nJohn (as Gregory VII had excommunicated the Emperor\nHenry IV two centuries before). In the year 1213 John had\nbeen obliged to make an ignominious peace just as Henry IV\nhad been obliged to do in the year 1077.",
        "Undismayed by his lack of success, John continued to abuse\nhis royal power until his disgruntled vassals made a prisoner\nof their anointed ruler and forced him to promise that he\nwould be good and would never again interfere with the ancient\nrights of his subjects. All this happened on a little island in\nthe Thames, near the village of Runnymede, on the 15th of\nJune of the year 1215. The document to which John signed\nhis name was called the Big Charter–the Magna Carta. It\ncontained very little that was new. It re-stated in short and\ndirect sentences the ancient duties of the king and enumerated\nthe privileges of his vassals. It paid little attention to the\nrights (if any) of the vast majority of the people, the peasants,\nbut it offered certain securities to the rising class of the\nmerchants. It was a charter of great importance because it defined\nthe powers of the king with more precision than had ever been\ndone before. But it was still a purely mediaeval document. It\ndid not refer to common human beings, unless they happened to\nbe the property of the vassal, which must be safe-guarded\nagainst royal tyranny just as the Baronial woods and cows\nwere protected against an excess of zeal on the part of the\nroyal foresters.",
        "A few years later, however, we begin to hear a very different\nnote in the councils of His Majesty.",
        "John, who was bad, both by birth and inclination, solemnly\nhad promised to obey the great charter and then had broken\nevery one of its many stipulations. Fortunately, he soon died\nand was succeeded by his son Henry III, who was forced to\nrecognise the charter anew. Meanwhile, Uncle Richard, the\nCrusader, had cost the country a great deal of money and the\nking was obliged to ask for a few loans that he might pay his\nobligations to the Jewish money-lenders. The large land-owners\nand the bishops who acted as councillors to the king could\nnot provide him with the necessary gold and silver. The king\nthen gave orders that a few representatives of the cities be\ncalled upon to attend the sessions of his Great Council. They\nmade their first appearance in the year 1265. They were supposed\nto act only as financial experts who were not supposed\nto take a part in the general discussion of matters of state, but\nto give advice exclusively upon the question of taxation.",
        "Gradually, however, these representatives of the “commons\"\nwere consulted upon many of the problems and the meeting\nof noblemen, bishops and city delegates developed into a regular\nParliament, a place “ou l’on parfait,” which means in English\nwhere people talked, before important affairs of state were\ndecided upon.",
        "But the institution of such a general advisory-board with\ncertain executive powers was not an English invention, as\nseems to ke the general belief, and government by a “king and\nhis parliament” was by no means restricted to the British Isles.\nYou will find it in every part of Europe. In some countries,\nlike France, the rapid increase of the Royal power after the\nMiddle Ages reduced the influence of the “parliament” to nothing.\nIn the year 1302 representatives of the cities had been\nadmitted to the meeting of the French Parliament, but five\ncenturies had to pass before this “Parliament” was strong\nenough to assert the rights of the middle class, the so-called\nThird Estate, and break the power of the king. Then they\nmade up for lost time and during the French Revolution, abolished\nthe king, the clergy and the nobles and made the representatives\nof the common people the rulers of the land. In\nSpain the “cortex” (the king’s council) had been opened to the\ncommoners as early as the first half of the twelfth century.\nIn the Germain Empire, a number of important cities had obtained\nthe rank of “imperial cities” whose representatives must\nbe heard in the imperial diet.",
        "In Sweden, representatives of the people attended the sessions\nof the Riksdag at the first meeting of the year 1359. In\nDenmark the Daneholf, the ancient national assembly, was re-\nestablished in 1314, and, although the nobles often regained control\nof the country at the expense of the king and the people,\nthe representatives of the cities were never completely deprived\nof their power.",
        "In the Scandinavian country, the story of representative\ngovernment is particularly interesting. In Iceland, the “Althing,\"\nthe assembly of all free landowners, who managed the\naffairs of the island, began to hold regular meetings in the ninth\ncentury and continued to do so for more than a thousand\nyears.",
        "In Switzerland, the freemen of the different cantons defended\ntheir assemblies against the attempts of a number of\nfeudal neighbours with great success.",
        "Finally, in the Low Countries, in Holland, the councils of\nthe different duchies and counties were attended by representatives\nof the third estate as early as the thirteenth century.",
        "In the sixteenth century a number of these small provinces\nrebelled against their king, abjured his majesty in a solemn\nmeeting of the “Estates General,” removed the clergy from\nthe discussions, broke the power of the nobles and assumed full\nexecutive authority over the newly-established Republic of the\nUnited Seven Netherlands. For two centuries, the representatives\nof the town-councils ruled the country without a king,\nwithout bishops and without noblemen. The city had become\nsupreme and the good burghers had become the rulers of the\nland.",
        "WHAT THE PEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE AGES\nTHOUGHT OF THE WORLD IN WHICH\nTHEY HAPPENED TO LIVE",
        "DATES are a very useful invention. We could not do without\nthem but unless we are very careful, they will play tricks\nwith us. They are apt to make history too precise. For example,\nwhen I talk of the point-of-view of mediaeval man, I\ndo not mean that on the 31st of December of the year 476,\nsuddenly all the people of Europe said, “Ah, now the Roman\nEmpire has come to an end and we are living in the Middle\nAges. How interesting!”",
        "You could have found men at the Frankish court of Charlemagne\nwho were Romans in their habits, in their manners, in\ntheir out-look upon life. On the other hand, when you grow\nup you will discover that some of the people in this world have\nnever passed beyond the stage of the cave-man. All times\nand all ages overlap, and the ideas of succeeding generations\nplay tag with each other. But it is possible to study the minds\nof a good many true representatives of the Middle Ages and\nthen give you an idea of the average man’s attitude toward\nlife and the many difficult problems of living.",
        "First of all, remember that the people of the Middle Ages\nnever thought of themselves as free-born citizens, who could\ncome and go at will and shape their fate according to their\nability or energy or luck. On the contrary, they all considered\nthemselves part of the general scheme of things, which included\nemperors and serfs, popes and heretics, heroes and swashbucklers,\nrich men, poor men, beggar men and thieves. They accepted\nthis divine ordinance and asked no questions. In this,\nof course, they differed radically from modern people who accept\nnothing and who are forever trying to improve their own\nfinancial and political situation.",
        "To the man and woman of the thirteenth century, the world\nhereafter–a Heaven of wonderful delights and a Hell of brimstone\nand suffering–meant something more than empty words\nor vague theological phrases. It was an actual fact and the\nmediaeval burghers and knights spent the greater part of their\ntime preparing for it. We modern people regard a noble\ndeath after a well-spent life with the quiet calm of the ancient\nGreeks and Romans. After three score years of work and effort,\nwe go to sleep with the feeling that all will be well.",
        "But during the Middle Ages, the King of Terrors with\nhis grinning skull and his rattling bones was man’s steady\ncompanion. He woke his victims up with terrible tunes on his\nscratchy fiddle he sat down with them at dinner–he smiled\nat them from behind trees and shrubs when they took a girl\nout for a walk. If you had heard nothing but hair-raising\nyarns about cemeteries and coffins and fearful diseases when\nyou were very young, instead of listening to the fairy stories\nof Anderson and Grimm, you, too, would have lived all your\ndays in a dread of the final hour and the gruesome day of\nJudgment. That is exactly what happened to the children of\nthe Middle Ages. They moved in a world of devils and spooks\nand only a few occasional angels. Sometimes, their fear of\nthe future filled their souls with humility and piety, but often\nit influenced them the other way and made them cruel and\nsentimental. They would first of all murder all the women\nand children of a captured city and then they would devoutly\nmarch to a holy spot and with their hands gory with the blood\nof innocent victims, they would pray that a merciful heaven forgive\nthem their sins. Yea, they would do more than pray, they\nwould weep bitter tears and would confess themselves the most\nwicked of sinners. But the next day, they would once more\nbutcher a camp of Saracen enemies without a spark of mercy\nin their hearts.",
        "Of course, the Crusaders were Knights and obeyed a somewhat\ndifferent code of manners from the common men. But in\nsuch respects the common man was just the same as his master.\nHe, too, resembled a shy horse, easily frightened by a\nshadow or a silly piece of paper, capable of excellent and faithful\nservice but liable to run away and do terrible damage when\nhis feverish imagination saw a ghost.",
        "In judging these good people, however, it is wise to remember\nthe terrible disadvantages under which they lived.\nThey were really barbarians who posed as civilised people.\nCharlemagne and Otto the Great were called “Roman Emperors,\"\nbut they had as little resemblance to a real Roman Emperor\n(say Augustus or Marcus Aurelius) as “King” Wumba\nWumba of the upper Congo has to the highly educated rulers\nof Sweden or Denmark. They were savages who lived amidst\nglorious ruins but who did not share the benefits of the\ncivilisation which their fathers and grandfathers had destroyed.\nThey knew nothing. They were ignorant of almost every fact\nwhich a boy of twelve knows to-day. They were obliged to go\nto one single book for all their information. That was the\nBible. But those parts of the Bible which have influenced the\nhistory of the human race for the better are those chapters of\nthe New Testament which teach us the great moral lessons of\nlove, charity and forgiveness. As a handbook of astronomy,\nzoology, botany, geometry and all the other sciences, the venerable\nbook is not entirely reliable. In the twelfth century, a\nsecond book was added to the mediaeval library, the great\nencyclopaedia of useful knowledge, compiled by Aristotle, the\nGreek philosopher of the fourth century before Christ. Why\nthe Christian church should have been willing to accord such\nhigh honors to the teacher of Alexander the Great, whereas\nthey condemned all other Greek philosophers on account of\ntheir heathenish doctrines, I really do not know. But next to\nthe Bible, Aristotle was recognized as the only reliable teacher\nwhose works could be safely placed into the hands of true\nChristians.",
        "His works had reached Europe in a somewhat roundabout\nway. They had gone from Greece to Alexandria. They had\nthen been translated from the Greek into the Arabic language\nby the Mohammedans who conquered Egypt in the seventh\ncentury. They had followed the Moslem armies into Spain and\nthe philosophy of the great Stagirite (Aristotle was a native of\nStagira in Macedonia) was taught in the Moorish universities\nof Cordova. The Arabic text was then translated into Latin\nby the Christian students who had crossed the Pyrenees to get\na liberal education and this much travelled version of the famous\nbooks was at last taught at the different schools of northwestern\nEurope. It was not very clear, but that made it all\nthe more interesting.",
        "With the help of the Bible and Aristotle, the most brilliant\nmen of the Middle Ages now set to work to explain all things\nbetween Heaven and Earth in their relation to the expressed\nwill of God. These brilliant men, the so-called Scholasts or\nSchoolmen, were really very intelligent, but they had obtained\ntheir information exclusively from books, and never from actual\nobservation. If they wanted to lecture on the sturgeon\nor on caterpillars, they read the Old and New Testaments and\nAristotle, and told their students everything these good books\nhad to say upon the subject of caterpillars and sturgeons.\nThey did not go out to the nearest river to catch a sturgeon.\nThey did not leave their libraries and repair to the backyard\nto catch a few caterpillars and look at these animals and study\nthem in their native haunts. Even such famous scholars as\nAlbertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas did not inquire whether\nthe sturgeons in the land of Palestine and the caterpillars of\nMacedonia might not have been different from the sturgeons\nand the caterpillars of western Europe.",
        "When occasionally an exceptionally curious person like\nRoger Bacon appeared in the council of the learned and began\nto experiment with magnifying glasses and funny little telescopes\nand actually dragged the sturgen and the caterpillar\ninto the lecturing room and proved that they were different\nfrom the creatures described by the Old Testament and by\nAristotle, the Schoolmen shook their dignified heads. Bacon\nwas going too far. When he dared to suggest that an hour\nof actual observation was worth more than ten years with\nAristotle and that the works of that famous Greek might as\nwell have remained untranslated for all the good they had ever\ndone, the scholasts went to the police and said, “This man is\na danger to the safety of the state. He wants us to study\nGreek that we may read Aristotle in the original. Why should\nhe not be contented with our Latin-Arabic translation which\nhas satisfied our faithful people for so many hundred years?\nWhy is he so curious about the insides of fishes and the insides\nof insects? He is probably a wicked magician trying to upset\nthe established order of things by his Black Magic.” And so\nwell did they plead their cause that the frightened guardians\nof the peace forbade Bacon to write a single word for more\nthan ten years. When he resumed his studies he had learned\na lesson. He wrote his books in a queer cipher which made it\nimpossible for his contemporaries to read them, a trick which\nbecame common as the Church became more desperate in its\nattempts to prevent people from asking questions which would\nlead to doubts and infidelity.",
        "This, however, was not done out of any wicked desire to\nkeep people ignorant. The feeling which prompted the heretic\nhunters of that day was really a very kindly one. They firmly\nbelieved–nay, they knew–that this life was but the preparation\nfor our real existence in the next world. They felt convinced\nthat too much knowledge made people uncomfortable,\nfilled their minds with dangerous opinions and led to doubt\nand hence to perdition. A mediaeval Schoolman who saw one\nof his pupils stray away from the revealed authority of the\nBible and Aristotle, that he might study things for himself, felt\nas uncomfortable as a loving mother who sees her young child\napproach a hot stove. She knows that he will burn his little\nfingers if he is allowed to touch it and she tries to keep him\nback, if necessary she will use force. But she really loves\nthe child and if he will only obey her, she will be as good to him\nas she possibly can be. In the same way the mediaeval guardians\nof people’s souls, while they were strict in all matters\npertaining to the Faith, slaved day and night to render the\ngreatest possible service to the members of their flock. They\nheld out a helping hand whenever they could and the society\nof that day shows the influence of thousands of good men and\npious women who tried to make the fate of the average mortal\nas bearable as possible.",
        "A serf was a serf and his position would never change. But\nthe Good Lord of the Middle Ages who allowed the serf to\nremain a slave all his life had bestowed an immortal soul upon\nthis humble creature and therefore he must be protected in his\nrights, that he might live and die as a good Christian. When\nhe grew too old or too weak to work he must be taken care\nof by the feudal master for whom he had worked. The serf,\ntherefore, who led a monotonous and dreary life, was never\nhaunted by fear of to-morrow. He knew that he was “safe\"–\nthat he could not be thrown out of employment, that he would\nalways have a roof over his head (a leaky roof, perhaps, but\nroof all the same), and that he would always have something\nto eat.",
        "This feeling of “stability” and of “safety” was found in all\nclasses of society. In the towns the merchants and the artisans\nestablished guilds which assured every member of a steady income.\nIt did not encourage the ambitious to do better than\ntheir neighbours. Too often the guilds gave protection to\nthe “slacker” who managed to “get by.” But they established\na general feeling of content and assurance among the\nlabouring classes which no longer exists in our day of general\ncompetition. The Middle Ages were familiar with the dangers\nof what we modern people call “corners,” when a single rich\nman gets hold of all the available grain or soap or pickled\nherring, and then forces the world to buy from him at his own\nprice. The authorities, therefore, discouraged wholesale trading\nand regulated the price at which merchants were allowed\nto sell their goods.",
        "The Middle Ages disliked competition. Why compete and\nfill the world with hurry and rivalry and a multitude of pushing\nmen, when the Day of Judgement was near at hand, when\nriches would count for nothing and when the good serf would\nenter the golden gates of Heaven while the bad knight was\nsent to do penance in the deepest pit of Inferno?",
        "In short, the people of the Middle Ages were asked to surrender\npart of their liberty of thought and action, that they\nmight enjoy greater safety from poverty of the body and poverty\nof the soul.",
        "And with a very few exceptions, they did not object. They\nfirmly believed that they were mere visitors upon this planet–\nthat they were here to be prepared for a greater and more\nimportant life. Deliberately they turned their backs upon a\nworld which was filled with suffering and wickedness and\ninjustice. They pulled down the blinds that the rays of the\nsun might not distract their attention from that chapter in the\nApocalypse which told them of that heavenly light which was\nto illumine their happiness in all eternity. They tried to close\ntheir eyes to most of the joys of the world in which they lived\nthat they might enjoy those which awaited them in the near\nfuture. They accepted life as a necessary evil and welcomed\ndeath as the beginning of a glorious day.",
        "The Greeks and the Romans had never bothered about the\nfuture but had tried to establish their Paradise right here upon\nthis earth. They had succeeded in making life extremely pleasant\nfor those of their fellow men who did not happen to be\nslaves. Then came the other extreme of the Middle Ages,\nwhen man built himself a Paradise beyond the highest clouds\nand turned this world into a vale of tears for high and low,\nfor rich and poor, for the intelligent and the dumb. It was\ntime for the pendulum to swing back in the other direction, as\nI shall tell you in my next chapter.",
        "HOW THE CRUSADES ONCE MORE MADE THE\nMEDITERRANEAN A BUSY CENTRE OF\nTRADE AND HOW THE CITIES OF THE\nITALIAN PENINSULA BECAME THE GREAT\nDISTRIBUTING CENTRE FOR THE COMMERCE\nWITH ASIA AND AFRICA",
        "THERE were three good reasons why the Italian cities should\nhave been the first to regain a position of great importance\nduring the late Middle Ages. The Italian peninsula had been\nsettled by Rome at a very early date. There had been more\nroads and more towns and more schools than anywhere else\nin Europe.",
        "The barbarians had burned as lustily in Italy as elsewhere,\nbut there had been so much to destroy that more had been able\nto survive. In the second place, the Pope lived in Italy and\nas the head of a vast political machine, which owned land and\nserfs and buildings and forests and rivers and conducted courts\nof law, he was in constant receipt of a great deal of money.\nThe Papal authorities had to be paid in gold and silver as did\nthe merchants and ship-owners of Venice and Genoa. The\ncows and the eggs and the horses and all the other agricultural\nproducts of the north and the west must be changed into actual\ncash before the debt could be paid in the distant city of Rome.",
        "This made Italy the one country where there was a comparative\nabundance of gold and silver. Finally, during the Crusades,\nthe Italian cities had become the point of embarkation\nfor the Crusaders and had profiteered to an almost unbelievable\nextent.",
        "And after the Crusades had come to an end, these same\nItalian cities remained the distributing centres for those Oriental\ngoods upon which the people of Europe had come to depend\nduring the time they had spent in the near east.",
        "Of these towns, few were as famous as Venice. Venice was\na republic built upon a mud bank. Thither people from the\nmainland had fled during the invasions of the barbarians in the\nfourth century. Surrounded on all sides by the sea they had\nengaged in the business of salt-making. Salt had been very\nscarce during the Middle Ages, and the price had been high.\nFor hundreds of years Venice had enjoyed a monopoly of\nthis indispensable table commodity (I say indispensable, because\npeople, like sheep, fall ill unless they get a certain amount\nof salt in their food). The people had used this monopoly to\nincrease the power of their city. At times they had even dared\nto defy the power of the Popes. The town had grown rich and\nhad begun to build ships, which engaged in trade with the\nOrient. During the Crusades, these ships were used to carry\npassengers to the Holy Land, and when the passengers could\nnot pay for their tickets in cash, they were obliged to help the\nVenetians who were for ever increasing their colonies in the\nAEgean Sea, in Asia Minor and in Egypt.",
        "By the end of the fourteenth century, the population had\ngrown to two hundred thousand, which made Venice the biggest\ncity of the Middle Ages. The people were without influence\nupon the government which was the private affair of a\nsmall number of rich merchant families. They elected a senate\nand a Doge (or Duke), but the actual rulers of the city were\nthe members of the famous Council of Ten,–who maintained\nthemselves with the help of a highly organised system of secret\nservice men and professional murderers, who kept watch upon\nall citizens and quietly removed those who might be dangerous\nto the safety of their high-handed and unscrupulous Committee\nof Public Safety.",
        "The other extreme of government, a democracy of very\nturbulent habits, was to be found in Florence. This city\ncontrolled the main road from northern Europe to Rome and used\nthe money which it had derived from this fortunate economic\nposition to engage in manufacturing. The Florentines tried to\nfollow the example of Athens. Noblemen, priests and members\nof the guilds all took part in the discussions of civic affairs.\nThis led to great civic upheaval. People were forever being divided\ninto political parties and these parties fought each other\nwith intense bitterness and exiled their enemies and confiscated\ntheir possessions as soon as they had gained a victory in the\ncouncil. After several centuries of this rule by organised mobs,\nthe inevitable happened. A powerful family made itself master\nof the city and governed the town and the surrounding country\nafter the fashion of the old Greek “tyrants.” They were called\nthe Medici. The earliest Medici had been physicians (medicus\nis Latin for physician, hence their name), but later they had\nturned banker. Their banks and their pawnshops were to be\nfound in all the more important centres of trade. Even today\nour American pawn-shops display the three golden balls\nwhich were part of the coat of arms of the mighty house of\nthe Medici, who became rulers of Florence and married their\ndaughters to the kings of France and were buried in graves\nworthy of a Roman Caesar.",
        "Then there was Genoa, the great rival of Venice, where\nthe merchants specialised in trade with Tunis in Africa and\nthe grain depots of the Black Sea. Then there were more than\ntwo hundred other cities, some large and some small, each a perfect\ncommercial unit, all of them fighting their neighbours and\nrivals with the undying hatred of neighbours who are depriving\neach other of their profits.",
        "Once the products of the Orient and Africa had been\nbrought to these distributing centres, they must be prepared\nfor the voyage to the west and the north.",
        "Genoa carried her goods by water to Marseilles, from where\nthey were reshipped to the cities along the Rhone, which in\nturn served as the market places of northern and western\nFrance.",
        "Venice used the land route to northern Europe. This ancient\nroad led across the Brenner pass, the old gateway for\nthe barbarians who had invaded Italy. Past Innsbruck, the\nmerchandise was carried to Basel. From there it drifted down\nthe Rhine to the North Sea and England, or it was taken to\nAugsburg where the Fugger family (who were both bankers\nand manufacturers and who prospered greatly by “shaving\"\nthe coins with which they paid their workmen), looked after\nthe further distribution to Nuremberg and Leipzig and the\ncities of the Baltic and to Wisby (on the Island of Gotland)\nwhich looked after the needs of the Northern Baltic and dealt\ndirectly with the Republic of Novgorod, the old commercial\ncentre of Russia which was destroyed by Ivan the Terrible in\nthe middle of the sixteenth century.",
        "The little cities on the coast of north-western Europe had\nan interesting story of their own. The mediaeval world ate a\ngreat deal of fish. There were many fast days and then people\nwere not permitted to eat meat. For those who lived away\nfrom the coast and from the rivers, this meant a diet of eggs\nor nothing at all. But early in the thirteenth century a Dutch\nfisherman had discovered a way of curing herring, so that it\ncould be transported to distant points. The herring fisheries\nof the North Sea then became of great importance. But some\ntime during the thirteenth century, this useful little fish (for\nreasons of its own) moved from the North Sea to the Baltic and\nthe cities of that inland sea began to make money. All the\nworld now sailed to the Baltic to catch herring and as that fish\ncould only be caught during a few months each year (the rest\nof the time it spends in deep water, raising large families of\nlittle herrings) the ships would have been idle during the rest\nof the time unless they had found another occupation. They\nwere then used to carry the wheat of northern and central Russia\nto southern and western Europe. On the return voyage\nthey brought spices and silks and carpets and Oriental rugs\nfrom Venice and Genoa to Bruges and Hamburg and Bremen.",
        "Out of such simple beginnings there developed an important\nsystem of international trade which reached from the\nmanufacturing cities of Bruges and Ghent (where the almighty\nguilds fought pitched battles with the kings of France and\nEngland and established a labour tyranny which completely\nruined both the employers and the workmen) to the Republic\nof Novgorod in northern Russia, which was a mighty city until\nTsar Ivan, who distrusted all merchants, took the town and\nkilled sixty thousand people in less than a month’s time and\nreduced the survivors to beggary.",
        "That they might protect themselves against pirates and\nexcessive tolls and annoying legislation, the merchants of the\nnorth founded a protective league which was called the\n\"Hansa.” The Hansa, which had its headquarters in Lubeck,\nwas a voluntary association of more than one hundred cities.\nThe association maintained a navy of its own which patrolled\nthe seas and fought and defeated the Kings of England and\nDenmark when they dared to interfere with the rights and the\nprivileges of the mighty Hanseatic merchants.",
        "I wish that I had more space to tell you some of the wonderful\nstories of this strange commerce which was carried on\nacross the high mountains and across the deep seas amidst\nsuch dangers that every voyage became a glorious adventure.\nBut it would take several volumes and it cannot be done here.",
        "Besides, I hope that I have told you enough about the Middle\nAges to make you curious to read more in the excellent books\nof which I shall give you a list at the end of this volume.",
        "The Middle Ages, as I have tried to show you, had been a\nperiod of very slow progress. The people who were in power\nbelieved that “progress” was a very undesirable invention of\nthe Evil One and ought to be discouraged, and as they hap-\npened to occupy the seats of the mighty, it was easy to enforce\ntheir will upon the patient serfs and the illiterate knights.\nHere and there a few brave souls sometimes ventured forth into\nthe forbidden region of science, but they fared badly and were\nconsidered lucky when they escaped with their lives and a jail\nsentence of twenty years.",
        "In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the flood of\ninternational commerce swept over western Europe as the Nile\nhad swept across the valley of ancient Egypt. It left behind\na fertile sediment of prosperity. Prosperity meant leisure\nhours and these leisure hours gave both men and women a\nchance to buy manuscripts and take an interest in literature\nand art and music.",
        "Then once more was the world filled with that divine curiosity\nwhich has elevated man from the ranks of those other\nmammals who are his distant cousins but who have remained\ndumb, and the cities, of whose growth and development I have\ntold you in my last chapter, offered a safe shelter to these\nbrave pioneers who dared to leave the very narrow domain\nof the established order of things.",
        "They set to work. They opened the windows of their\ncloistered and studious cells. A flood of sunlight entered the\ndusty rooms and showed them the cobwebs which had gathered\nduring the long period of semi-darkness.",
        "They began to clean house. Next they cleaned their gardens.",
        "Then they went out into the open fields, outside the crumbling\ntown walls, and said, “This is a good world. We are\nglad that we live in it.”",
        "At that moment, the Middle Ages came to an end and a new\nworld began.",
        "PEOPLE ONCE MORE DARED TO BE HAPPY\nJUST BECAUSE THEY WERE ALIVE. THEY\nTRIED TO SAVE THE REMAINS OF THE\nOLDER AND MORE AGREEABLE CIVILISATION\nOF ROME AND GREECE AND THEY\nWERE SO PROUD OF THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS\nTHAT THEY SPOKE OF A RENAISSANCE\nOR RE-BIRTH OF CIVILISATION",
        "THE Renaissance was not a political or religious movement.\nIt was a state of mind.",
        "The men of the Renaissance continued to be the obedient\nsons of the mother church. They were subjects of kings and\nemperors and dukes and murmured not.",
        "But their outlook upon life was changed. They began to\nwear different clothes–to speak a different language–to live\ndifferent lives in different houses.",
        "They no longer concentrated all their thoughts and their\nefforts upon the blessed existence that awaited them in Heaven.\nThey tried to establish their Paradise upon this planet, and,\ntruth to tell, they succeeded in a remarkable degree.",
        "I have quite often warned you against the danger that\nlies in historical dates. People take them too literally. They\nthink of the Middle Ages as a period of darkness and ignor-\nance. “Click,” says the clock, and the Renaissance begins and\ncities and palaces are flooded with the bright sunlight of an\neager intellectual curiosity.",
        "As a matter of fact, it is quite impossible to draw such\nsharp lines. The thirteenth century belonged most decidedly\nto the Middle Ages. All historians agree upon that. But was\nit a time of darkness and stagnation merely? By no means.\nPeople were tremendously alive. Great states were being\nfounded. Large centres of commerce were being developed.\nHigh above the turretted towers of the castle and the peaked\nroof of the town-hall, rose the slender spire of the newly built\nGothic cathedral. Everywhere the world was in motion. The\nhigh and mighty gentlemen of the city-hall, who had just become\nconscious of their own strength (by way of their recently\nacquired riches) were struggling for more power with their\nfeudal masters. The members of the guilds who had just become\naware of the important fact that “numbers count” were\nfighting the high and mighty gentlemen of the city-hall. The\nking and his shrewd advisers went fishing in these troubled\nwaters and caught many a shining bass of profit which they\nproceeded to cook and eat before the noses of the surprised and\ndisappointed councillors and guild brethren.",
        "To enliven the scenery during the long hours of evening\nwhen the badly lighted streets did not invite further political\nand economic dispute, the Troubadours and Minnesingers told\ntheir stories and sang their songs of romance and adventure\nand heroism and loyalty to all fair women. Meanwhile youth,\nimpatient of the slowness of progress, flocked to the universities,\nand thereby hangs a story.",
        "The Middle Ages were “internationally minded.” That\nsounds difficult, but wait until I explain it to you. We modern\npeople are “nationally minded.” We are Americans or Englishmen\nor Frenchmen or Italians and speak English or French\nor Italian and go to English and French and Italian universities,\nunless we want to specialise in some particular branch\nof learning which is only taught elsewhere, and then we learn\nanother language and go to Munich or Madrid or Moscow.\nBut the people of the thirteenth or fourteenth century rarely\ntalked of themselves as Englishmen or Frenchmen or Italians.\nThey said, “I am a citizen of Sheffield or Bordeaux or Genoa.\"\nBecause they all belonged to one and the same church they felt\na certain bond of brotherhood. And as all educated men could\nspeak Latin, they possessed an international language which\nremoved the stupid language barriers which have grown up\nin modern Europe and which place the small nations at such\nan enormous disadvantage. Just as an example, take the case\nof Erasmus, the great preacher of tolerance and laughter, who\nwrote his books in the sixteenth century. He was the native\nof a small Dutch village. He wrote in Latin and all the world\nwas his audience. If he were alive to-day, he would write in\nDutch. Then only five or six million people would be able to\nread him. To be understood by the rest of Europe and America,\nhis publishers would be obliged to translate his books into\ntwenty different languages. That would cost a lot of money\nand most likely the publishers would never take the trouble\nor the risk.",
        "Six hundred years ago that could not happen. The greater\npart of the people were still very ignorant and could not read\nor write at all. But those who had mastered the difficult art\nof handling the goose-quill belonged to an international republic\nof letters which spread across the entire continent and which\nknew of no boundaries and respected no limitations of language\nor nationality. The universities were the strongholds of\nthis republic. Unlike modern fortifications, they did not follow\nthe frontier. They were to be found wherever a teacher\nand a few pupils happened to find themselves together. There\nagain the Middle Ages and the Renaissance differed from our\nown time. Nowadays, when a new university is built, the\nprocess (almost invariably) is as follows: Some rich man\nwants to do something for the community in which he lives or\na particular religious sect wants to build a school to keep its\nfaithful children under decent supervision, or a state needs doc-\ntors and lawyers and teachers. The university begins as a\nlarge sum of money which is deposited in a bank. This money\nis then used to construct buildings and laboratories and dormitories.\nFinally professional teachers are hired, entrance examinations\nare held and the university is on the way.",
        "But in the Middle Ages things were done differently. A wise man\nsaid to himself, “I have discovered a great truth. I must impart my\nknowledge to others.” And he began to preach his wisdom\nwherever and whenever he could get a few people to listen to him,\nlike a modern soap-box orator. If he was an interesting speaker, the\ncrowd came and stayed. If he was dull, they shrugged their shoulders\nand continued their way.",
        "By and by certain young men began to come regularly to hear\nthe words of wisdom of this great teacher. They brought copybooks\nwith them and a little bottle of ink and a goose quill and\nwrote down what seemed to be important. One day it rained.\nThe teacher and his pupils retired to an empty basement or\nthe room of the “Professor.” The learned man sat in his chair\nand the boys sat on the floor. That was the beginning of the\nUniversity, the “universitas,” a corporation of professors and\nstudents during the Middle Ages, when the “teacher” counted\nfor everything and the building in which he taught counted for\nvery little.",
        "As an example, let me tell you of something that happened\nin the ninth century. In the town of Salerno near Naples there\nwere a number of excellent physicians. They attracted people\ndesirous of learning the medical profession and for almost a\nthousand years (until 1817) there was a university of Salerno\nwhich taught the wisdom of Hippocrates, the great Greek doctor\nwho had practiced his art in ancient Hellas in the fifth\ncentury before the birth of Christ.",
        "Then there was Abelard, the young priest from Brittany,\nwho early in the twelfth century began to lecture on theology\nand logic in Paris. Thousands of eager young men flocked\nto the French city to hear him. Other priests who disagreed\nwith him stepped forward to explain their point of view. Paris\nwas soon filled with a clamouring multitude of Englishmen and\nGermans and Italians and students from Sweden and Hungary\nand around the old cathedral which stood on a little island in\nthe Seine there grew the famous University of Paris.\nIn Bologna in Italy, a monk by the name of Gratian had\ncompiled a text-book for those whose business it was to know\nthe laws of the church. Young priests and many laymen then\ncame from all over Europe to hear Gratian explain his ideas.\nTo protect themselves against the landlords and the innkeepers\nand the boarding-house ladies of the city, they formed a corporation\n(or University) and behold the beginning of the university\nof Bologna.",
        "Next there was a quarrel in the University of Paris. We do\nnot know what caused it, but a number of disgruntled teachers\ntogether with their pupils crossed the channel and found a\nhospitable home in n little village on the Thames called Oxford,\nand in this way the famous University of Oxford came into\nbeing. In the same way, in the year 1222, there had been a split\nin the University of Bologna. The discontented teachers (again\nfollowed by their pupils) had moved to Padua and their proud city\nthenceforward boasted of a university of its own. And so it went\nfrom Valladolid in Spain to Cracow in distant Poland and from\nPoitiers in France to Rostock in Germany.",
        "It is quite true that much of the teaching done by these\nearly professors would sound absurd to our ears, trained to\nlisten to logarithms and geometrical theorems. The point\nhowever, which I want to make is this–the Middle Ages and\nespecially the thirteenth century were not a time when the\nworld stood entirely still. Among the younger generation,\nthere was life, there was enthusiasm, and there was a restless\nif somewhat bashful asking of questions. And out of this\nturmoil grew the Renaissance.",
        "But just before the curtain went down upon the last scene\nof the Mediaeval world, a solitary figure crossed the stage, of\nwhom you ought to know more than his mere name. This\nman was called Dante. He was the son of a Florentine lawyer\nwho belonged to the Alighieri family and he saw the light of\nday in the year 1265. He grew up in the city of his ancestors\nwhile Giotto was painting his stories of the life of St. Francis\nof Assisi upon the walls of the Church of the Holy Cross, but\noften when he went to school, his frightened eyes would see the\npuddles of blood which told of the terrible and endless warfare\nthat raged forever between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines,\nthe followers of the Pope and the adherents of the Emperors.",
        "When he grew up, he became a Guelph, because his father\nhad been one before him, just as an American boy might become\na Democrat or a Republican, simply because his father\nhad happened to be a Democrat or a Republican. But after a\nfew years, Dante saw that Italy, unless united under a single\nhead, threatened to perish as a victim of the disordered jealousies\nof a thousand little cities. Then he became a Ghilbeiline.",
        "He looked for help beyond the Alps. He hoped that a\nmighty emperor might come and re-establish unity and order.\nAlas! he hoped in vain. The Ghibellines were driven out of\nFlorence in the year 1802. From that time on until the day\nof his death amidst the dreary ruins of Ravenna, in the year\n1321, Dante was a homeless wanderer, eating the bread of\ncharity at the table of rich patrons whose names would have\nsunk into the deepest pit of oblivion but for this single fact,\nthat they had been kind to a poet in his misery. During the\nmany years of exile, Dante felt compelled to justify himself\nand his actions when he had been a political leader in his\nhome-town, and when he had spent his days walking along\nthe banks of the Arno that he might catch a glimpse of the\nlovely Beatrice Portinari, who died the wife of another man, a\ndozen years before the Ghibelline disaster.",
        "He had failed in the ambitions of his career. He had\nfaithfully served the town of is birth and before a corrupt\ncourt he had been accused of stealing the public funds and\nhad been condemned to be burned alive should he venture\nback within the realm of the city of Florence. To clear\nhimself before his own conscience and before his contemporaries,\nDante then created an Imaginary World and with great\ndetail he described the circumstances which had led to\nhis defeat and depicted the hopeless condition of greed and lust\nand hatred which had turned his fair and beloved Italy into a\nbattlefield for the pitiless mercenaries of wicked and selfish\ntyrants.",
        "He tells us how on the Thursday before Easter of the year\n1300 he had lost his way in a dense forest and how he found\nhis path barred by a leopard and a lion and a wolf. He gave\nhimself up for lost when a white figure appeared amidst the\ntrees. It was Virgil, the Roman poet and philosopher, sent\nupon his errand of mercy by the Blessed Virgin and by Beatrice,\nwho from high Heaven watched over the fate of her\ntrue lover. Virgil then takes Dante through Purgatory and\nthrough Hell. Deeper and deeper the path leads them until\nthey reach the lowest pit where Lucifer himself stands frozen\ninto the eternal ice surrounded by the most terrible of sinners,\ntraitors and liars and those who have achieved fame and\nsuccess by lies and by deceit. But before the two wanderers\nhave reached this terrible spot, Dante has met all those who\nin some way or other have played a role in the history of his\nbeloved city. Emperors and Popes, dashing knights and\nwhining usurers, they are all there, doomed to eternal punishment\nor awaiting the day of deliverance, when they shall\nleave Purgatory for Heaven.",
        "It is a curious story. It is a handbook of everything the\npeople of the thirteenth century did and felt and feared and\nprayed for. Through it all moves the figure of the lonely\nFlorentine exile, forever followed by the shadow of his own\ndespair.",
        "And behold! when the gates of death were closing upon\nthe sad poet of the Middle Ages, the portals of life swung\nopen to the child who was to be the first of the men of the\nRenaissance. That was Francesco Petrarca, the son of the\nnotary public of the little town of Arezzo.",
        "Francesco’s father had belonged to the same political party\nas Dante. He too had been exiled and thus it happened that\nPetrarca (or Petrarch, as we call him) was born away from\nFlorence. At the age of fifteen he was sent to Montpellier\nin France that he might become a lawyer like his father. But\nthe boy did not want to be a jurist. He hated the law. He\nwanted to be a scholar and a poet–and because he wanted to\nbe a scholar and a poet beyond everything else, he became one,\nas people of a strong will are apt to do. He made long\nvoyages, copying manuscripts in Flanders and in the cloisters\nalong the Rhine and in Paris and Liege and finally in Rome.\nThen he went to live in a lonely valley of the wild mountains\nof Vaucluse, and there he studied and wrote and soon he had\nbecome so famous for his verse and for his learning that both\nthe University of Paris and the king of Naples invited him\nto come and teach their students and subjects. On the way\nto his new job, he was obliged to pass through Rome. The\npeople had heard of his fame as an editor of half-forgotten\nRoman authors. They decided to honour him and in the\nancient forum of the Imperial City, Petrarch was crowned with\nthe laurel wreath of the Poet.",
        "From that moment on, his life was an endless career of\nhonour and appreciation. He wrote the things which people\nwanted most to hear. They were tired of theological\ndisputations. Poor Dante could wander through hell as much as\nhe wanted. But Petrarch wrote of love and of nature and the\nsun and never mentioned those gloomy things which seemed\nto have been the stock in trade of the last generation. And\nwhen Petrarch came to a city, all the people flocked out to\nmeet him and he was received like a conquering hero. If he\nhappened to bring his young friend Boccaccio, the story teller,\nwith him, so much the better. They were both men of their\ntime, full of curiosity, willing to read everything once, digging\nin forgotten and musty libraries that they might find still another\nmanuscript of Virgil or Ovid or Lucrece or any of the\nother old Latin poets. They were good Christians. Of course\nthey were! Everyone was. But no need of going around with\na long face and wearing a dirty coat just because some day\nor other you were going to die. Life was good. People were\nmeant to be happy. You desired proof of this? Very well.\nTake a spade and dig into the soil. What did you find?\nBeautiful old statues. Beautiful old vases. Ruins of ancient\nbuildings. All these things were made by the people of the\ngreatest empire that ever existed. They ruled all the world\nfor a thousand years. They were strong and rich and handsome\n(just look at that bust of the Emperor Augustus!). Of\ncourse, they were not Christians and they would never be\nable to enter Heaven. At best they would spend their days\nin purgatory, where Dante had just paid them a visit.",
        "But who cared? To have lived in a world like that of\nancient Rome was heaven enough for any mortal being. And\nanyway, we live but once. Let us be happy and cheerful for\nthe mere joy of existence.",
        "Such, in short, was the spirit that had begun to fill the\nnarrow and crooked streets of the many little Italian cities.",
        "You know what we mean by the “bicycle craze” or the\n\"automobile craze.” Some one invents a bicycle. People who\nfor hundreds of thousands of years have moved slowly and\npainfully from one place to another go “crazy” over the prospect\nof rolling rapidly and easily over hill and dale. Then\na clever mechanic makes the first automobile. No longer is it\nnecessary to pedal and pedal and pedal. You just sit and\nlet little drops of gasoline do the work for you. Then everybody\nwants an automobile. Everybody talks about Rolls-\nRoyces and Flivvers and carburetors and mileage and oil. Explorers\npenetrate into the hearts of unknown countries that\nthey may find new supplies of gas. Forests arise in Sumatra\nand in the Congo to supply us with rubber. Rubber and oil\nbecome so valuable that people fight wars for their possession.\nThe whole world is “automobile mad” and little children can\nsay “car” before they learn to whisper “papa” and “mamma.”",
        "In the fourteenth century, the Italian people went crazy\nabout the newly discovered beauties of the buried world of\nRome. Soon their enthusiasm was shared by all the people of\nwestern Europe. The finding of an unknown manuscript became\nthe excuse for a civic holiday. The man who wrote a\ngrammar became as popular as the fellow who nowadays invents\na new spark-plug. The humanist, the scholar who devoted his\ntime and his energies to a study of “homo” or mankind (instead\nof wasting his hours upon fruitless theological investigations),\nthat man was regarded with greater honour and a deeper respect\nthan was ever bestowed upon a hero who had just conquered\nall the Cannibal Islands.",
        "In the midst of this intellectual upheaval, an event occurred\nwhich greatly favoured the study of the ancient philosophers\nand authors. The Turks were renewing their attacks upon\nEurope. Constantinople, capital of the last remnant of the\noriginal Roman Empire, was hard pressed. In the year 1393\nthe Emperor, Manuel Paleologue, sent Emmanuel Chrysoloras\nto western Europe to explain the desperate state of old Byzantium\nand to ask for aid. This aid never came. The Roman\nCatholic world was more than willing to see the Greek Catholic\nworld go to the punishment that awaited such wicked heretics.\nBut however indifferent western Europe might be to the fate\nof the Byzantines, they were greatly interested in the ancient\nGreeks whose colonists had founded the city on the Bosphorus\nten centuries after the Trojan war. They wanted to learn\nGreek that they might read Aristotle and Homer and Plato.\nThey wanted to learn it very badly, but they had no books and\nno grammars and no teachers. The magistrates of Florence\nheard of the visit of Chrysoloras. The people of their city\nwere “crazy to learn Greek.” Would he please come and\nteach them? He would, and behold! the first professor of\nGreek teaching alpha, beta, gamma to hundreds of eager young\nmen, begging their way to the city of the Arno, living in stables\nand in dingy attics that they night learn how to decline the verb\n<gr paidenw paideneis paidenei> and enter into the companionship of\nSophocles and Homer.",
        "Meanwhile in the universities, the old schoolmen, teaching\ntheir ancient theology and their antiquated logic; explaining\nthe hidden mysteries of the old Testament and discussing the\nstrange science of their Greek-Arabic-Spanish-Latin edition of\nAristotle, looked on in dismay and horror. Next, they turned\nangry. This thing was going too far. The young men were\ndeserting the lecture halls of the established universities to\ngo and listen to some wild-eyed “humanist” with his newfangled\nnotions about a “reborn civilization.”",
        "They went to the authorities. They complained. But one\ncannot force an unwilling horse to drink and one cannot\nmake unwilling ears listen to something which does not really\ninterest them. The schoolmen were losing ground rapidly. Here\nand there they scored a short victory. They combined forces\nwith those fanatics who hated to see other people enjoy a\nhappiness which was foreign to their own souls. In Florence,\nthe centre of the Great Rebirth, a terrible fight was fought\nbetween the old order and the new. A Dominican monk, sour\nof face and bitter in his hatred of beauty, was the leader of\nthe mediaeval rear-guard. He fought a valiant battle. Day\nafter day he thundered his warnings of God’s holy wrath\nthrough the wide halls of Santa Maria del Fiore. “Repent,\"\nhe cried, “repent of your godlessness, of your joy in things\nthat are not holy!” He began to hear voices and to see flaming\nswords that flashed through the sky. He preached to the\nlittle children that they might not fall into the errors of these\nways which were leading their fathers to perdition. He organised\ncompanies of boy-scouts, devoted to the service of the\ngreat God whose prophet he claimed to be. In a sudden moment\nof frenzy, the frightened people promised to do penance\nfor their wicked love of beauty and pleasure. They carried\ntheir books and their statues and their paintings to the market\nplace and celebrated a wild “carnival of the vanities” with holy\nsinging and most unholy dancing, while Savonarola applied his\ntorch to the accumulated treasures.",
        "But when the ashes cooled down, the people began to realise\nwhat they had lost. This terrible fanatic had made them destroy\nthat which they had come to love above all things. They\nturned against him, Savonarola was thrown into jail. He was\ntortured. But he refused to repent for anything he had done.\nHe was an honest man. He had tried to live a holy life. He\nhad willingly destroyed those who deliberately refused to\nshare his own point of view. It had been his duty to eradicate\nevil wherever he found it. A love of heathenish books and\nheathenish beauty in the eyes of this faithful son of the Church,\nhad been an evil. But he stood alone. He had fought the\nbattle of a time that was dead and gone. The Pope in Rome\nnever moved a finger to save him. On the contrary, he approved\nof his “faithful Florentines” when they dragged Savonarola\nto the gallows, hanged him and burned his body amidst\nthe cheerful howling and yelling of the mob.",
        "It was a sad ending, but quite inevitable. Savonarola\nwould have been a great man in the eleventh century. In the\nfifteenth century he was merely the leader of a lost cause.\nFor better or worse, the Middle Ages had come to an end when\nthe Pope had turned humanist and when the Vatican became\nthe most important museum of Roman and Greek antiquities.",
        "THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO FEEL THE NEED OF\nGIVING EXPRESSION TO THEIR NEWLY\nDISCOVERED JOY OF LIVING. THEY EXPRESSED\nTHEIR HAPPINESS IN POETRY\nAND IN SCULPTURE AND IN ARCHITECTURE\nAND IN PAINTING AND IN THE\nBOOKS THEY PRINTED",
        "IN the year 1471 there died a pious old man who had spent\nseventy-two of his ninety-one years behind the sheltering walls\nof the cloister of Mount St. Agnes near the good town of\nZwolle, the old Dutch Hanseatic city on the river Ysel. He\nwas known as Brother Thomas and because he had been born\nin the village of Kempen, he was called Thomas a Kempis.\nAt the age of twelve he had been sent to Deventer, where\nGerhard Groot, a brilliant graduate of the universities of\nParis, Cologne and Prague, and famous as a wandering\npreacher, had founded the Society of the Brothers of the\nCommon Life. The good brothers were humble laymen who\ntried to live the simple life of the early Apostles of Christ\nwhile working at their regular jobs as carpenters and house-\npainters and stone masons. They maintained an excellent\nschool, that deserving boys of poor parents might be taught\nthe wisdom of the Fathers of the church. At this school,\nlittle Thomas had learned how to conjugate Latin verbs and\nhow to copy manuscripts. Then he had taken his vows, had\nput his little bundle of books upon his back, had wandered to\nZwolle and with a sigh of relief he had closed the door upon a\nturbulent world which did not attract him.",
        "Thomas lived in an age of turmoil, pestilence and sudden\ndeath. In central Europe, in Bohemia, the devoted disciples of\nJohannus Huss, the friend and follower of John Wycliffe, the\nEnglish reformer, were avenging with a terrible warfare the death\nof their beloved leader who had been burned at the stake by order of\nthat same Council of Constance, which had promised him a safe-conduct\nif he would come to Switzerland and explain his doctrines to the Pope,\nthe Emperor, twenty-three cardinals, thirty-three archbishops and bishops,\none hundred and fifty abbots and more than a hundred princes and\ndukes who had gathered together to reform their church.",
        "In the west, France had been fighting for a hundred years that\nshe might drive the English from her territories and just then was\nsaved from utter defeat by the fortunate appearance of Joan of Arc.\nAnd no sooner had this struggle come to an end than France and Burgundy\nwere at each other’s throats, engaged upon a struggle of life and death\nfor the supremacy of western Europe.",
        "In the south, a Pope at Rome was calling the curses of\nHeaven down upon a second Pope who resided at Avignon,\nin southern France, and who retaliated in kind. In the\nfar east the Turks were destroying the last remnants of the\nRoman Empire and the Russians had started upon a final\ncrusade to crush the power of their Tartar masters.",
        "But of all this, Brother Thomas in his quiet cell never\nheard. He had his manuscripts and his own thoughts and\nhe was contented. He poured his love of God into a little\nvolume. He called it the Imitation of Christ. It has since\nbeen translated into more languages than any other book\nsave the Bible. It has been read by quite as many people\nas ever studied the Holy Scriptures. It has influenced the\nlives of countless millions. And it was the work of a man\nwhose highest ideal of existence was expressed in the simple\nwish that “he might quietly spend his days sitting in a little\ncorner with a little book.”",
        "Good Brother Thomas represented the purest ideals of the\nMiddle Ages. Surrounded on all sides by the forces of the\nvictorious Renaissance, with the humanists loudly proclaiming\nthe coming of modern times, the Middle Ages gathered\nstrength for a last sally. Monasteries were reformed. Monks\ngave up the habits of riches and vice. Simple, straightforward\nand honest men, by the example of their blameless\nand devout lives, tried to bring the people back to the ways of\nrighteousness and humble resignation to the will of God. But\nall to no avail. The new world rushed past these good people.\nThe days of quiet meditation were gone. The great era of\n\"expression” had begun.",
        "Here and now let me say that I am sorry that I must use\nso many “big words.” I wish that I could write this history in\nwords of one syllable. But it cannot be done. You cannot\nwrite a text-book of geometry without reference to a hypotenuse\nand triangles and a rectangular parallelopiped. You\nsimply have to learn what those words mean or do without\nmathematics. In history (and in all life) you will eventually\nbe obliged to learn the meaning of many strange words of\nLatin and Greek origin. Why not do it now?",
        "When I say that the Renaissance was an era of expression,\nI mean this: People were no longer contented to be the\naudience and sit still while the emperor and the pope told\nthem what to do and what to think. They wanted to be actors\nupon the stage of life. They insisted upon giving “expression\"\nto their own individual ideas. If a man happened to be interested\nin statesmanship like the Florentine historian, Niccolo\nMacchiavelli, then he “expressed” himself in his books which\nrevealed his own idea of a successful state and an efficient\nruler. If on the other hand he had a liking for painting, he\n\"expressed” his love for beautiful lines and lovely colours in\nthe pictures which have made the names of Giotto, Fra Angelico,\nRafael and a thousand others household words wherever\npeople have learned to care for those things which express\na true and lasting beauty.",
        "If this love for colour and line happened to be combined with\nan interest in mechanics and hydraulics, the result was a Leonardo\nda Vinci, who painted his pictures, experimented with\nhis balloons and flying machines, drained the marshes of the\nLombardian plains and “expressed” his joy and interest in all\nthings between Heaven and Earth in prose, in painting, in\nsculpture and in curiously conceived engines. When a man of\ngigantic strength, like Michael Angelo, found the brush and\nthe palette too soft for his strong hands, he turned to sculpture\nand to architecture, and hacked the most terrific creatures out\nof heavy blocks of marble and drew the plans for the church\nof St. Peter, the most concrete “expression” of the glories\nof the triumphant church. And so it went.",
        "All Italy (and very soon all of Europe) was filled with\nmen and women who lived that they might add their mite to\nthe sum total of our accumulated treasures of knowledge and\nbeauty and wisdom. In Germany, in the city of Mainz, Johann\nzum Gansefleisch, commonly known as Johann Gutenberg, had\njust invented a new method of copying books. He had studied\nthe old woodcuts and had perfected a system by which individual\nletters of soft lead could be placed in such a way that\nthey formed words and whole pages. It is true, he soon lost\nall his money in a law-suit which had to do with the original\ninvention of the press. He died in poverty, but the “expression\"\nof his particular inventive genius lived after him.",
        "Soon Aldus in Venice and Etienne in Paris and Plantin in\nAntwerp and Froben in Basel were flooding the world with\ncarefully edited editions of the classics printed in the Gothic\nletters of the Gutenberg Bible, or printed in the Italian type\nwhich we use in this book, or printed in Greek letters, or in\nHebrew.",
        "Then the whole world became the eager audience of those\nwho had something to say. The day when learning had been\na monopoly of a privileged few came to an end. And the\nlast excuse for ignorance was removed from this world, when\nElzevier of Haarlem began to print his cheap and popular\neditions. Then Aristotle and Plato, Virgil and Horace and\nPliny, all the goodly company of the ancient authors and\nphilosophers and scientists, offered to become man’s faithful\nfriend in exchange for a few paltry pennies. Humanism had\nmade all men free and equal before the printed word.",
        "BUT NOW THAT PEOPLE HAD BROKEN\nTHROUGH THE BONDS OF THEIR NARROW\nMEDIAEVAL LIMITATIONS, THEY HAD TO\nHAVE MORE ROOM FOR THEIR WANDERINGS.\nTHE EUROPEAN WORLD HAD\nGROWN TOO SMALL FOR THEIR AMBITIONS.\nIT WAS THE TIME OF THE GREAT\nVOYAGES OF DISCOVERY",
        "THE Crusades had been a lesson in the liberal art of travelling.\nBut very few people had ever ventured beyond the well-\nknown beaten track which led from Venice to Jaffe. In the\nthirteenth century the Polo brothers, merchants of Venice,\nhad wandered across the great Mongolian desert and after\nclimbing mountains as high as the moon, they had found their\nway to the court of the great Khan of Cathay, the mighty\nemperor of China. The son of one of the Polos, by the name\nof Marco, had written a book about their adventures, which\ncovered a period of more than twenty years. The astonished\nworld had gaped at his descriptions of the golden towers of\nthe strange island of Zipangu, which was his Italian way of\nspelling Japan. Many people had wanted to go east, that\nthey might find this gold-land and grow rich. But the trip was\ntoo far and too dangerous and so they stayed at home.",
        "Of course, there was always the possibility of making the\nvoyage by sea. But the sea was very unpopular in the Middle\nAges and for many very good reasons. In the first place, ships\nwere very small. The vessels on which Magellan made his\nfamous trip around the world, which lasted many years, were\nnot as large as a modern ferryboat. They carried from twenty\nto fifty men, who lived in dingy quarters (too low to allow any\nof them to stand up straight) and the sailors were obliged to\neat poorly cooked food as the kitchen arrangements were very\nbad and no fire could be made whenever the weather was the\nleast bit rough. The mediaeval world knew how to pickle herring\nand how to dry fish. But there were no canned goods\nand fresh vegetables were never seen on the bill of fare as\nsoon as the coast had been left behind. Water was carried in\nsmall barrels. It soon became stale and then tasted of rotten\nwood and iron rust and was full of slimy growing things. As\nthe people of the Middle Ages knew nothing about microbes\n(Roger Bacon, the learned monk of the thirteenth century\nseems to have suspected their existence, but he wisely kept\nhis discovery to himself) they often drank unclean water and\nsometimes the whole crew died of typhoid fever. Indeed the\nmortality on board the ships of the earliest navigators was\nterrible. Of the two hundred sailors who in the year 1519 left\nSeville to accompany Magellan on his famous voyage around\nthe world, only eighteen returned. As late as the seventeenth\ncentury when there was a brisk trade between western Europe\nand the Indies, a mortality of 40 percent was nothing unusual\nfor a trip from Amsterdam to Batavia and back. The greater\npart of these victims died of scurvy, a disease which is caused\nby lack of fresh vegetables and which affects the gums and\npoisons the blood until the patient dies of sheer exhaustion.",
        "Under those circumstances you will understand that the sea\ndid not attract the best elements of the population. Famous\ndiscoverers like Magellan and Columbus and Vasco da Gama\ntravelled at the head of crews that were almost entirely composed\nof ex-jailbirds, future murderers and pickpockets out\nof a Job.",
        "These navigators certainly deserve our admiration for the\ncourage and the pluck with which they accomplished their\nhopeless tasks in the face of difficulties of which the people of\nour own comfortable world can have no conception. Their\nships were leaky. The rigging was clumsy. Since the middle\nof the thirteenth century they had possessed some sort of a\ncompass (which had come to Europe from China by way of\nArabia and the Crusades) but they had very bad and incorrect\nmaps. They set their course by God and by guess. If luck\nwas with them they returned after one or two or three years.\nIn the other case, their bleeched bones remained behind on\nsome lonely beach. But they were true pioneers. They gambled\nwith luck. Life to them was a glorious adventure. And\nall the suffering, the thirst and the hunger and the pain were\nforgotten when their eyes beheld the dim outlines of a new coast\nor the placid waters of an ocean that had lain forgotten since\nthe beginning of time.",
        "Again I wish that I could make this book a thousand pages\nlong. The subject of the early discoveries is so fascinating.\nBut history, to give you a true idea of past times, should be\nlike those etchings which Rembrandt used to make. It should\ncast a vivid light on certain important causes, on those which\nare best and greatest. All the rest should be left in the shadow\nor should be indicated by a few lines. And in this chapter I\ncan only give you a short list of the most important discoveries.",
        "Keep in mind that all during the fourteenth and fifteenth\ncenturies the navigators were trying to accomplish just ONE\nTHING–they wanted to find a comfortable and safe road to the\nempire of Cathay (China), to the island of Zipangu (Japan)\nand to those mysterious islands, where grew the spices which\nthe mediaeval world had come to like since the days of the\nCrusades, and which people needed in those days before the\nintroduction of cold storage, when meat and fish spoiled very\nquickly and could only be eaten after a liberal sprinkling of\npepper or nutmeg.",
        "The Venetians and the Genoese had been the great navigators\nof the Mediterranean, but the honour for exploring the\ncoast of the Atlantic goes to the Portuguese. Spain and Portugal\nwere full of that patriotic energy which their age-old\nstruggle against the Moorish invaders had developed. Such\nenergy, once it exists, can easily be forced into new channels.\nIn the thirteenth century, King Alphonso III had conquered\nthe kingdom of Algarve in the southwestern corner of the\nSpanish peninsula and had added it to his dominions. In the\nnext century, the Portuguese had turned the tables on the\nMohammedans, had crossed the straits of Gibraltar and had\ntaken possession of Ceuta, opposite the Arabic city of Ta’Rifa\n(a word which in Arabic means “inventory” and which by way\nof the Spanish language has come down to us as “tariff,”) and\nTangiers, which became the capital of an African addition to\nAlgarve.",
        "They were ready to begin their career as explorers.",
        "In the year 1415, Prince Henry, known as Henry the\nNavigator, the son of John I of Portugal and Philippa, the\ndaughter of John of Gaunt (about whom you can read in\nRichard II, a play by William Shakespeare) began to make\npreparations for the systematic exploration of northwestern\nAfrica. Before this, that hot and sandy coast had been visited\nby the Phoenicians and by the Norsemen, who remembered it\nas the home of the hairy “wild man” whom we have come to\nknow as the gorilla. One after another, Prince Henry\nand his captains discovered the Canary Islands–re-discovered\nthe island of Madeira which a century before had been visited\nby a Genoese ship, carefully charted the Azores which had\nbeen vaguely known to both the Portuguese and the Spaniards,\nand caught a glimpse of the mouth of the Senegal River on\nthe west coast of Africa, which they supposed to be the western\nmouth of the Nile. At last, by the middle of the Fifteenth\nCentury, they saw Cape Verde, or the Green Cape, and the\nCape Verde Islands, which lie almost halfway between the\ncoast of Africa and Brazil.",
        "But Henry did not restrict himself in his investigations to\nthe waters of the Ocean. He was Grand Master of the Order\nof Christ. This was a Portuguese continuation of the crusading\norder of the Templars which had been abolished by\nPope Clement V in the year 1312 at the request of King\nPhilip the Fair of France, who had improved the occasion by\nburning his own Templars at the stake and stealing all their\npossessions. Prince Henry used the revenues of the domains\nof his religious order to equip several expeditions which explored\nthe hinterland of the Sahara and of the coast of Guinea.",
        "But he was still very much a son of the Middle Ages and\nspent a great deal of time and wasted a lot of money upon a\nsearch for the mysterious “Presser John,” the mythical Christian\nPriest who was said to be the Emperor of a vast empire\n\"situated somewhere in the east.” The story of this strange\npotentate had first been told in Europe in the middle of the\ntwelfth century. For three hundred years people had tried\nto find “Presser John” and his descendants Henry took part\nin the search. Thirty years after his death, the riddle was\nsolved.",
        "In the year 1486 Bartholomew Diaz, trying to find the land\nof Prester John by sea, had reached the southernmost point\nof Africa. At first he called it the Storm Cape, on account of\nthe strong winds which had prevented him from continuing his\nvoyage toward the east, but the Lisbon pilots who understood\nthe importance of this discovery in their quest for the India\nwater route, changed the name into that of the Cape of Good\nHope.",
        "One year later, Pedro de Covilham, provided with letters\nof credit on the house of Medici, started upon a similar mission\nby land. He crossed the Mediterranean and after leaving\nEgypt, he travelled southward. He reached Aden, and from\nthere, travelling through the waters of the Persian Gulf which\nfew white men had seen since the days of Alexander the Great,\neighteen centuries before, he visited Goa and Calicut on the\ncoast of India where he got a great deal of news about the\nisland of the Moon (Madagascar) which was supposed to lie\nhalfway between Africa and India. Then he returned, paid\na secret visit to Mecca and to Medina, crossed the Red Sea\nonce more and in the year 1490 he discovered the realm of\nPrester John, who was no one less than the Black Negus (or\nKing) of Abyssinia, whose ancestors had adopted Christianity\nin the fourth century, seven hundred years before the Christian\nmissionaries had found their way to Scandinavia.",
        "These many voyages had convinced the Portuguese geographers\nand cartographers that while the voyage to the Indies\nby an eastern sea-route was possible, it was by no means easy.\nThen there arose a great debate. Some people wanted to continue\nthe explorations east of the Cape of Good Hope. Others\nsaid, “No, we must sail west across the Atlantic and then we\nshall reach Cathay.”",
        "Let us state right here that most intelligent people of that\nday were firmly convinced that the earth was not as flat as a\npancake but was round. The Ptolemean system of the universe,\ninvented and duly described by Claudius Ptolemy, the great\nEgyptian geographer, who had lived in the second century of\nour era, which had served the simple needs of the men of the\nMiddle Ages, had long been discarded by the scientists of the\nRenaissance. They had accepted the doctrine of the Polish\nmathematician, Nicolaus Copernicus, whose studies had con-\nvinced him that the earth was one of a number of round planets\nwhich turned around the sun, a discovery which he did not venture\nto publish for thirty-six years (it was printed in 1548,\nthe year of his death) from fear of the Holy Inquisition, a\nPapal court which had been established in the thirteenth century\nwhen the heresies of the Albigenses and the Waldenses\nin France and in Italy (very mild heresies of devoutly pious\npeople who did not believe in private property and preferred\nto live in Christ-like poverty) had for a moment threatened the\nabsolute power of the bishops of Rome. But the belief in the\nroundness of the earth was common among the nautical experts\nand, as I said, they were now debating the respective\nadvantages of the eastern and the western routes.",
        "Among the advocates of the western route was a Genoese\nmariner by the name of Cristoforo Colombo. He was the son\nof a wool merchant. He seems to have been a student at the\nUniversity of Pavia where he specialised in mathematics and\ngeometry. Then he took up his father’s trade but soon we find\nhim in Chios in the eastern Mediterranean travelling on business.\nThereafter we hear of voyages to England but whether\nhe went north in search of wool or as the captain of a ship we\ndo not know. In February of the year 1477, Colombo (if we\nare to believe his own words) visited Iceland, but very likely\nhe only got as far as the Faroe Islands which are cold enough\nin February to be mistaken for Iceland by any one. Here\nColombo met the descendants of those brave Norsemen who\nin the tenth century had settled in Greenland and who had\nvisited America in the eleventh century, when Leif’s vessel\nhad been blown to the coast of Vineland, or Labrador.",
        "What had become of those far western colonies no one\nknew. The American colony of Thorfinn Karlsefne, the husband\nof the widow of Leif’s brother Thorstein, founded in the\nyear 1003, had been discontinued three years later on account\nof the hostility of the Esquimaux. As for Greenland, not a\nword had been heard from the settlers since the year 1440.\nVery likely the Greenlanders had all died of the Black Death.\nwhich had just killed half the people of Norway. However\nthat might be, the tradition of a “vast land in the distant west\"\nstill survived among the people of the Faroe and Iceland, and\nColombo must have heard of it. He gathered further information\namong the fishermen of the northern Scottish islands and\nthen went to Portugal where he married the daughter of one\nof the captains who had served under Prince Henry the\nNavigator.",
        "From that moment on (the year 1478) he devoted himself\nto the quest of the western route to the Indies. He sent his\nplans for such a voyage to the courts of Portugal and Spain.\nThe Portuguese, who felt certain that they possessed a monop-\noly of the eastern route, would not listen to his plans. In\nSpain, Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, whose\nmarriage in 1469 had made Spain into a single kingdom, were\nbusy driving the Moors from their last stronghold, Granada.\nThey had no money for risky expeditions. They needed every\npeseta for their soldiers.",
        "Few people were ever forced to fight as desperately for\ntheir ideas as this brave Italian. But the story of Colombo\n(or Colon or Columbus, as we call him,) is too well known to\nbear repeating. The Moors surrendered Granada on the second\nof January of the year 1492. In the month of April of the\nsame year, Columbus signed a contract with the King and\nQueen of Spain. On Friday, the 3rd of August, he left Palos\nwith three little ships and a crew of 88 men, many of whom\nwere criminals who had been offered indemnity of punishment\nif they joined the expedition. At two o’clock in the morning\nof Friday, the 12th of October, Columbus discovered land. On\nthe fourth of January of the year 1493, Columbus waved farewell\nto the 44 men of the little fortress of La Navidad (none\nof whom was ever again seen alive) and returned homeward.\nBy the middle of February he reached the Azores where the\nPortuguese threatened to throw him into gaol. On the fifteenth\nof March, 1493, the admiral reached Palos and together with\nhis Indians (for he was convinced that he had discovered some\noutlying islands of the Indies and called the natives red\nIndians) he hastened to Barcelona to tell his faithful patrons\nthat he had been successful and that the road to the gold and\nthe silver of Cathay and Zipangu was at the disposal of their\nmost Catholic Majesties.",
        "Alas, Columbus never knew the truth. Towards the end\nof his life, on his fourth voyage, when he had touched the mainland\nof South America, he may have suspected that all was\nnot well with his discovery. But he died in the firm belief\nthat there was no solid continent between Europe and Asia\nand that he had found the direct route to China.",
        "Meanwhile, the Portuguese, sticking to their eastern route,\nhad been more fortunate. In the year 1498, Vasco da Gama\nhad been able to reach the coast of Malabar and return safely\nto Lisbon with a cargo of spice. In the year 1502 he had\nrepeated the visit. But along the western route, the work of\nexploration had been most disappointing. In 1497 and 1498\nJohn and Sebastian Cabot had tried to find a passage to Japan\nbut they had seen nothing but the snowbound coasts and the\nrocks of Newfoundland, which had first been sighted by the\nNorthmen, five centuries before. Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine\nwho became the Pilot Major of Spain, and who gave his\nname to our continent, had explored the coast of Brazil, but\nhad found not a trace of the Indies.",
        "In the year 1513, seven years after the death of Columbus,\nthe truth at last began to dawn upon the geographers of\nEurope. Vasco Nunez de Balboa had crossed the Isthmus of\nPanama, had climbed the famous peak in Darien, and had\nlooked down upon a vast expanse of water which seemed to\nsuggest the existence of another ocean.",
        "Finally in the year 1519 a fleet of five small Spanish ships\nunder command of the Portuguese navigator, Ferdinand de\nMagellan, sailed westward (and not eastward since that route,\nwas absolutely in the hands of the Portuguese who allowed no\ncompetition) in search of the Spice Islands. Magellan crossed\nthe Atlantic between Africa and Brazil and sailed southward.\nHe reached a narrow channel between the southernmost point\nof Patagonia, the “land of the people with the big feet,” and\nthe Fire Island (so named on account of a fire, the only sign of\nthe existence of natives, which the sailors watched one night).\nFor almost five weeks the ships of Magellan were at the mercy\nof the terrible storms and blizzards which swept through the\nstraits. A mutiny broke out among the sailors. Magellan\nsuppressed it with terrible severity and sent two of his men\non shore where they were left to repent of their sins at leisure.\nAt last the storms quieted down, the channel broadened, and\nMagellan entered a new ocean. Its waves were quiet and\nplacid. He called it the Peaceful Sea, the Mare Pacifico.\nThen he continued in a western direction. He sailed for\nninety-eight days without seeing land. His people almost\nperished from hunger and thirst and ate the rats that infested\nthe ships, and when these were all gone they chewed pieces of\nsail to still their gnawing hunger.",
        "In March of the year 1521 they saw land. Magellan called\nit the land of the Ladrones (which means robbers) because the\nnatives stole everything they could lay hands on. Then further\nwestward to the Spice Islands!",
        "Again land was sighted. A group of lonely islands. Magellan\ncalled them the Philippines, after Philip, the son of his\nmaster Charles V, the Philip II of unpleasant historical memory.\nAt first Magellan was well received, but when he used\nthe guns of his ships to make Christian converts he was killed\nby the aborigines, together with a number of his captains and\nsailors. The survivors burned one of the three remaining ships\nand continued their voyage. They found the Moluccas, the\nfamous Spice Islands; they sighted Borneo and reached Tidor.\nThere, one of the two ships, too leaky to be of further use,\nremained behind with her crew. The “Vittoria,” under Sebastian\ndel Cano, crossed the Indian Ocean, missed seeing the\nnorthern coast of Australia (which was not discovered until\nthe first half of the seventeenth century when ships of the\nDutch East India Company explored this flat and inhospitable\nland), and after great hardships reached Spain.",
        "This was the most notable of all voyages. It had taken\nthree years. It had been accomplished at a great cost both of\nmen and money. But it had established the fact that the earth\nwas round and that the new lands discovered by Columbus were\nnot a part of the Indies but a separate continent. From that\ntime on, Spain and Portugal devoted all their energies to the\ndevelopment of their Indian and American trade. To prevent\nan armed conflict between the rivals, Pope Alexander VI (the\nonly avowed heathen who was ever elected to this most holy\noffice) had obligingly divided the world into two equal parts\nby a line of demarcation which followed the 50th degree of\nlongitude west of Greenwich, the so-called division of Tordesillas\nof 1494. The Portuguese were to establish their colonies\nto the east of this line, the Spaniards were to have theirs\nto the west. This accounts for the fact that the entire American\ncontinent with the exception of Brazil became Spanish and\nthat all of the Indies and most of Africa became Portuguese\nuntil the English and the Dutch colonists (who had no respect\nfor Papal decisions) took these possessions away in the seventeenth\nand eighteenth centuries.",
        "When news of the discovery of Columbus reached the\nRialto of Venice, the Wall street of the Middle Ages, there\nwas a terrible panic. Stocks and bonds went down 40 and 50\npercent. After a short while, when it appeared that Columbus\nhad failed to find the road to Cathay, the Venetian merchants\nrecovered from their fright. But the voyages of da Gama and\nMagellan proved the practical possibilities of an eastern water-\nroute to the Indies. Then the rulers of Genoa and Venice,\nthe two great commercial centres of the Middle Ages and the\nRenaissance, began to be sorry that they had refused to listen\nto Columbus. But it was too late. Their Mediterranean became\nan inland sea. The overland trade to the Indies and\nChina dwindled to insignificant proportions. The old days\nof Italian glory were gone. The Atlantic became the new\ncentre of commerce and therefore the centre of civilisation.\nIt has remained so ever since.",
        "See how strangely civilisation has progressed since those\nearly days, fifty centuries before, when the inhabitants of the\nValley of the Nile began to keep a written record of history,\nFrom the river Nile, it went to Mesopotamia, the land between\nthe rivers. Then came the turn of Crete and Greece and\nRome. An inland sea became the centre of trade and the cities\nalong the Mediterranean were the home of art and science and\nphilosophy and learning. In the sixteenth century it moved\nwestward once more and made the countries that border upon\nthe Atlantic become the masters of the earth.",
        "There are those who say that the world war and the suicide\nof the great European nations has greatly diminished the\nimportance of the Atlantic Ocean. They expect to see civilisation\ncross the American continent and find a new home in the\nPacific. But I doubt this.",
        "The westward trip was accompanied by a steady increase in\nthe size of ships and a broadening of the knowledge of the navigators.\nThe flat-bottomed vessels of the Nile and the Euphrates\nwere replaced by the sailing vessels of the Phoenicians, the\nAEgeans, the Greeks, the Carthaginians and the Romans.\nThese in turn were discarded for the square rigged vessels of\nthe Portuguese and the Spaniards. And the latter were driven\nfrom the ocean by the full-rigged craft of the English and the\nDutch.",
        "At present, however, civilisation no longer depends upon\nships. Aircraft has taken and will continue to take the place\nof the sailing vessel and the steamer. The next centre of\ncivilisation will depend upon the development of aircraft and\nwater power. And the sea once more shall be the undisturbed\nhome of the little fishes, who once upon a time shared their deep\nresidence with the earliest ancestors of the human race.",
        "CONCERNING BUDDHA AND CONFUCIUS",
        "THE discoveries of the Portuguese and the Spaniards had\nbrought the Christians of western Europe into close contact\nwith the people of India and of China. They knew of course\nthat Christianity was not the only religion on this earth. There\nwere the Mohammedans and the heathenish tribes of northern\nAfrica who worshipped sticks and stones and dead trees. But\nin India and in China the Christian conquerors found new\nmillions who had never heard of Christ and who did not want\nto hear of Him, because they thought their own religion, which\nwas thousands of years old, much better than that of the West.\nAs this is a story of mankind and not an exclusive history of\nthe people of Europe and our western hemisphere, you ought\nto know something of two men whose teaching and whose\nexample continue to influence the actions and the thoughts\nof the majority of our fellow-travellers on this earth.",
        "In India, Buddha was recognised as the great religious\nteacher. His history is an interesting one. He was born in\nthe Sixth Century before the birth of Christ, within sight of the\nmighty Himalaya Mountains, where four hundred years before\nZarathustra (or Zoroaster), the first of the great leaders of\nthe Aryan race (the name which the Eastern branch of the\nIndo-European race had given to itself), had taught his people\nto regard life as a continuous struggle between Ahriman,\nand Ormuzd, the Gods of Evil and Good. Buddha’s\nfather was Suddhodana, a mighty chief among the tribe of the\nSakiyas. His mother, Maha Maya, was the daughter of a\nneighbouring king. She had been married when she was a very\nyoung girl. But many moons had passed beyond the distant\nridge of hills and still her husband was without an heir who\nshould rule his lands after him. At last, when she was fifty\nyears old, her day came and she went forth that she might be\namong her own people when her baby should come into this\nworld.",
        "It was a long trip to the land of the Koliyans, where Maha\nMaya had spent her earliest years. One night she was resting\namong the cool trees of the garden of Lumbini. There her son\nwas born. He was given the name of Siddhartha, but we know\nhim as Buddha, which means the Enlightened One.",
        "In due time, Siddhartha grew up to be a handsome young\nprince and when he was nineteen years old, he was married to\nhis cousin Yasodhara. During the next ten years he lived\nfar away from all pain and all suffering, behind the protecting\nwalls of the royal palace, awaiting the day when he should\nsucceed his father as King of the Sakiyas.",
        "But it happened that when he was thirty years old, he drove\noutside of the palace gates and saw a man who was old and\nworn out with labour and whose weak limbs could hardly carry\nthe burden of life. Siddhartha pointed him out to his coachman,\nChanna, but Channa answered that there were lots of\npoor people in this world and that one more or less did not\nmatter. The young prince was very sad but he did not say\nanything and went back to live with his wife and his father\nand his mother and tried to be happy. A little while later he\nleft the palace a second time. His carriage met a man who\nsuffered from a terrible disease. Siddhartha asked Channa\nwhat had been the cause of this man’s suffering, but the coachman\nanswered that there were many sick people in this world\nand that such things could not be helped and did not matter\nvery much. The young prince was very sad when he heard this\nbut again he returned to his people.",
        "A few weeks passed. One evening Siddhartha ordered his\ncarriage in order to go to the river and bathe. Suddenly his\nhorses were frightened by the sight of a dead man whose rotting\nbody lay sprawling in the ditch beside the road. The young\nprince, who had never been allowed to see such things, was\nfrightened, but Channa told him not to mind such trifles. The\nworld was full of dead people. It was the rule of life that all\nthings must come to an end. Nothing was eternal. The grave\nawaited us all and there was no escape.",
        "That evening, when Siddhartha returned to his home, he\nwas received with music. While he was away his wife had\ngiven birth to a son. The people were delighted because now\nthey knew that there was an heir to the throne and they\ncelebrated the event by the beating of many drums. Siddhartha,\nhowever, did not share their joy. The curtain of life had been\nlifted and he had learned the horror of man’s existence. The\nsight of death and suffering followed him like a terrible dream.",
        "That night the moon was shining brightly. Siddhartha\nwoke up and began to think of many things. Never again\ncould he be happy until he should have found a solution to the\nriddle of existence. He decided to find it far away from all\nthose whom he loved. Softly he went into the room where\nYasodhara was sleeping with her baby. Then he called for\nhis faithful Channa and told him to follow.",
        "Together the two men went into the darkness of the night,\none to find rest for his soul, the other to be a faithful servant\nunto a beloved master.",
        "The people of India among whom Siddhartha wandered for\nmany years were just then in a state of change. Their ancestors,\nthe native Indians, had been conquered without great difficulty\nby the war-like Aryans (our distant cousins) and thereafter\nthe Aryans had been the rulers and masters of tens of\nmillions of docile little brown men. To maintain themselves in\nthe seat of the mighty, they had divided the population into\ndifferent classes and gradually a system of “caste” of the most\nrigid sort had been enforced upon the natives. The descendants\nof the Indo-European conquerors belonged to the highest\n\"caste,” the class of warriors and nobles. Next came the caste\nof the priests. Below these followed the peasants and the\nbusiness men. The ancient natives, however, who were called\nPariahs, formed a class of despised and miserable slaves and\nnever could hope to be anything else.",
        "Even the religion of the people was a matter of caste. The\nold Indo-Europeans, during their thousands of years of\nwandering, had met with many strange adventures. These had\nbeen collected in a book called the Veda. The language of\nthis book was called Sanskrit, and it was closely related to the\ndifferent languages of the European continent, to Greek and\nLatin and Russian and German and two-score others. The\nthree highest castes were allowed to read these holy scriptures.\nThe Pariah, however, the despised member of the lowest caste,\nwas not permitted to know its contents. Woe to the man of\nnoble or priestly caste who should teach a Pariah to study the\nsacred volume!",
        "The majority of the Indian people, therefore, lived in\nmisery. Since this planet offered them very little joy, salvation\nfrom suffering must be found elsewhere. They tried to\nderive a little consolation from meditation upon the bliss of\ntheir future existence.",
        "Brahma, the all-creator who was regarded by the Indian\npeople as the supreme ruler of life and death, was worshipped\nas the highest ideal of perfection. To become like Brahma, to\nlose all desires for riches and power, was recognised as the most\nexalted purpose of existence. Holy thoughts were regarded\nas more important than holy deeds, and many people went\ninto the desert and lived upon the leaves of trees and starved\ntheir bodies that they might feed their souls with the glorious\ncontemplation of the splendours of Brahma, the Wise, the\nGood and the Merciful.",
        "Siddhartha, who had often observed these solitary wanderers\nwho were seeking the truth far away from the turmoil\nof the cities and the villages, decided to follow their example.\nHe cut his hair. He took his pearls and his rubies and sent\nthem back to his family with a message of farewell, which the\never faithful Channa carried. Without a single follower, the\nyoung prince then moved into the wilderness.",
        "Soon the fame of his holy conduct spread among the mountains.\nFive young men came to him and asked that they might\nbe allowed to listen to his words of wisdom. He agreed to be\ntheir master if they would follow him. They consented, and\nhe took them into the hills and for six years he taught them\nall he knew amidst the lonely peaks of the Vindhya Mountains.\nBut at the end of this period of study, he felt that he was still\nfar from perfection. The world that he had left continued to\ntempt him. He now asked that his pupils leave him and then\nhe fasted for forty-nine days and nights, sitting upon the roots\nof an old tree. At last he received his reward. In the dusk of\nthe fiftieth evening, Brahma revealed himself to his faithful\nservant. From that moment on, Siddhartha was called Buddha\nand he was revered as the Enlightened One who had come to\nsave men from their unhappy mortal fate.",
        "The last forty-five years of his life, Buddha spent within\nthe valley of the Ganges River, teaching his simple lesson of\nsubmission and meekness unto all men. In the year 488 before\nour era, he died, full of years and beloved by millions of people.\nHe had not preached his doctrines for the benefit of a single\nclass. Even the lowest Pariah might call himself his disciple.",
        "This, however, did not please the nobles and the priests and\nthe merchants who did their best to destroy a creed which recognised\nthe equality of all living creatures and offered men the\nhope of a second life (a reincarnation) under happier circumstances.\nAs soon as they could, they encouraged the people of\nIndia to return to the ancient doctrines of the Brahmin creed\nwith its fasting and its tortures of the sinful body. But\nBuddhism could not be destroyed. Slowly the disciples of the\nEnlightened One wandered across the valleys of the Himalayas,\nand moved into China. They crossed the Yellow Sea\nand preached the wisdom of their master unto the people of\nJapan, and they faithfully obeyed the will of their great master,\nwho had forbidden them to use force. To-day more people\nrecognise Buddha as their teacher than ever before and their\nnumber surpasses that of the combined followers of Christ and Mohammed.",
        "As for Confucius, the wise old man of the Chinese, his\nstory is a simple one. He was born in the year 550 B.C. He\nled a quiet, dignified and uneventful life at a time when China\nwas without a strong central government and when the Chinese\npeople were at the mercy of bandits and robber-barons who\nwent from city to city, pillaging and stealing and murdering\nand turning the busy plains of northern and central China into\na wilderness of starving people.",
        "Confucius, who loved his people, tried to save them. He\ndid not have much faith in the use of violence. He was a very\npeaceful person. He did not think that he could make people\nover by giving them a lot of new laws. He knew that the only\npossible salvation would come from a change of heart, and he\nset out upon the seemingly hopeless task of changing the character\nof his millions of fellow men who inhabited the wide plains\nof eastern Asia. The Chinese had never been much interested\nin religion as we understand that word. They believed in\ndevils and spooks as most primitive people do. But they had\nno prophets and recognised no “revealed truth.” Confucius\nis almost the only one among the great moral leaders who did\nnot see visions, who did not proclaim himself as the messenger\nof a divine power; who did not, at some time or another, claim\nthat he was inspired by voices from above.",
        "He was just a very sensible and kindly man, rather given\nto lonely wanderings and melancholy tunes upon his faithful\nflute. He asked for no recognition. He did not demand that\nany one should follow him or worship him. He reminds us\nof the ancient Greek philosophers, especially those of the Stoic\nSchool, men who believed in right living and righteous thinking\nwithout the hope of a reward but simply for the peace of\nthe soul that comes with a good conscience.",
        "Confucius was a very tolerant man. He went out of his\nway to visit Lao-Tse, the other great Chinese leader and the\nfounder of a philosophic system called “Taoism,” which was\nmerely an early Chinese version of the Golden Rule.",
        "Confucius bore no hatred to any one. He taught the virtue\nof supreme self-possession. A person of real worth, according\nto the teaching of Confucius, did not allow himself to be\nruffled by anger and suffered whatever fate brought him with\nthe resignation of those sages who understand that everything\nwhich happens, in one way or another, is meant for the best.",
        "At first he had only a few students. Gradually the number\nincreased. Before his death, in the year 478 B.C., several of the\nkings and the princes of China confessed themselves his disciples.\nWhen Christ was born in Bethlehem, the philosophy of\nConfucius had already become a part of the mental make-up\nof most Chinamen. It has continued to influence their lives\never since. Not however in its pure, original form. Most religions\nchange as time goes on. Christ preached humility and\nmeekness and absence from worldly ambitions, but fifteen\ncenturies after Golgotha, the head of the Christian church was\nspending millions upon the erection of a building that bore\nlittle relation to the lonely stable of Bethlehem.",
        "Lao-Tse taught the Golden Rule, and in less than three\ncenturies the ignorant masses had made him into a real and\nvery cruel God and had buried his wise commandments under\na rubbish-heap of superstition which made the lives of the average\nChinese one long series of frights and fears and horrors.",
        "Confucius had shown his students the beauties of honouring\ntheir Father and their Mother. They soon began to be more\ninterested in the memory of their departed parents than in the\nhappiness of their children and their grandchildren. Deliberately\nthey turned their backs upon the future and tried to\npeer into the vast darkness of the past. The worship of the\nancestors became a positive religious system. Rather than\ndisturb a cemetery situated upon the sunny and fertile side of\na mountain, they would plant their rice and wheat upon the\nbarren rocks of the other slope where nothing could possibly\ngrow. And they preferred hunger and famine to the desecration\nof the ancestral grave.",
        "At the same time the wise words of Confucius never quite\nlost their hold upon the increasing millions of eastern Asia.\nConfucianism, with its profound sayings and shrewd observations,\nadded a touch of common-sense philosophy to the soul of\nevery Chinaman and influenced his entire life, whether he was\na simple laundry man in a steaming basement or the ruler of vast\nprovinces who dwelt behind the high walls of a secluded palace.",
        "In the sixteenth century the enthusiastic but rather uncivilised\nChristians of the western world came face to face with\nthe older creeds of the East. The early Spaniards and Portuguese\nlooked upon the peaceful statues of Buddha and contemplated\nthe venerable pictures of Confucius and did not in\nthe least know what to make of those worthy prophets with\ntheir far-away smile. They came to the easy conclusion that\nthese strange divinities were just plain devils who represented\nsomething idolatrous and heretical and did not deserve the\nrespect of the true sons of the Church. Whenever the spirit\nof Buddha or Confucius seemed to interfere with the trade in\nspices and silks, the Europeans attacked the “evil influence\"\nwith bullets and grape-shot. That system had certain very\ndefinite disadvantages. It has left us an unpleasant heritage\nof ill-will which promises little good for the immediate future.",
        "THE PROGRESS OF THE HUMAN RACE IS BEST\nCOMPARED TO A GIGANTIC PENDULUM\nWHICH FOREVER SWINGS FORWARD AND\nBACKWARD. THE RELIGIOUS INDIFFERENCE\nAND THE ARTISTIC AND LITERARY\nENTHUSIASM OF THE RENAISSANCE\nWERE FOLLOWED BY THE ARTISTIC AND\nLITERARY INDIFFERENCE AND THE RELIGIOUS\nENTHUSIASM OF THE REFORMATION",
        "OF course you have heard of the Reformation. You think\nof a small but courageous group of pilgrims who crossed the\nocean to have “freedom of religious worship.” Vaguely in the\ncourse of time (and more especially in our Protestant countries)\nthe Reformation has come to stand for the idea of\n\"liberty of thought.” Martin Luther is represented as the\nleader of the vanguard of progress. But when history is\nsomething more than a series of flattering speeches addressed\nto our own glorious ancestors, when to use the words of the\nGerman historian Ranke, we try to discover what “actually\nhappened,” then much of the past is seen in a very different\nlight.",
        "Few things in human life are either entirely good or entirely\nbad. Few things are either black or white. It is the duty of\nthe honest chronicler to give a true account of all the good and\nbad sides of every historical event. It is very difficult to do\nthis because we all have our personal likes and dislikes. But\nwe ought to try and be as fair as we can be, and must not allow\nour prejudices to influence us too much.",
        "Take my own case as an example. I grew up in the very\nProtestant centre of a very Protestant country. I never saw\nany Catholics until I was about twelve years old. Then I felt\nvery uncomfortable when I met them. I was a little bit afraid.\nI knew the story of the many thousand people who had been\nburned and hanged and quartered by the Spanish Inquisition\nwhen the Duke of Alba tried to cure the Dutch people of their\nLutheran and Calvinistic heresies. All that was very real\nto me. It seemed to have happened only the day before. It\nmight occur again. There might be another Saint Bartholomew’s\nnight, and poor little me would be slaughtered in my\nnightie and my body would be thrown out of the window, as\nhad happened to the noble Admiral de Coligny.",
        "Much later I went to live for a number of years in a Catholic\ncountry. I found the people much pleasanter and much\nmore tolerant and quite as intelligent as my former countrymen.\nTo my great surprise, I began to discover that there\nwas a Catholic side to the Reformation, quite as much as a\nProtestant.",
        "Of course the good people of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies, who actually lived through the Reformation, did\nnot see things that way. They were always right and their\nenemy was always wrong. It was a question of hang or be\nhanged, and both sides preferred to do the hanging. Which\nwas no more than human and for which they deserve no blame.",
        "When we look at the world as it appeared in the year 1500,\nan easy date to remember, and the year in which the Emperor\nCharles V was born, this is what we see. The feudal disorder\nof the Middle Ages has given way before the order of a number\nof highly centralised kingdoms. The most powerful of\nall sovereigns is the great Charles, then a baby in a cradle.\nHe is the grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella and of Maxi-\nmilian of Habsburg, the last of the mediaeval knights, and of\nhis wife Mary, the daughter of Charles the Bold, the ambitious\nBurgundian duke who had made successful war upon France\nbut had been killed by the independent Swiss peasants. The\nchild Charles, therefore, has fallen heir to the greater part of\nthe map, to all the lands of his parents, grandparents, uncles,\ncousins and aunts in Germany, in Austria, in Holland, in\nBelgium, in Italy, and in Spain, together with all their colonies\nin Asia, Africa and America. By a strange irony of fate, he\nhas been born in Ghent, in that same castle of the counts of\nFlanders, which the Germans used as a prison during their\nrecent occupation of Belgium, and although a Spanish king\nand a German emperor, he receives the training of a Fleming.",
        "As his father is dead (poisoned, so people say, but this is\nnever proved), and his mother has lost her mind (she is travelling\nthrough her domains with the coffin containing the body\nof her departed husband), the child is left to the strict\ndiscipline of his Aunt Margaret. Forced to rule Germans and\nItalians and Spaniards and a hundred strange races, Charles\ngrows up a Fleming, a faithful son of the Catholic Church,\nbut quite averse to religious intolerance. He is rather lazy,\nboth as a boy and as a man. But fate condemns him to rule\nthe world when the world is in a turmoil of religious fervour.\nForever he is speeding from Madrid to Innsbruck and from\nBruges to Vienna. He loves peace and quiet and he is always\nat war. At the age of fifty-five, we see him turn his back upon\nthe human race in utter disgust at so much hate and so much\nstupidity. Three years later he dies, a very tired and disappointed\nman.",
        "So much for Charles the Emperor. How about the Church,\nthe second great power in the world? The Church has changed\ngreatly since the early days of the Middle Ages, when it started\nout to conquer the heathen and show them the advantages of\na pious and righteous life. In the first place, the Church has\ngrown too rich. The Pope is no longer the shepherd of a flock\nof humble Christians. He lives in a vast palace and surrounds\nhimself with artists and musicians and famous literary men.\nHis churches and chapels are covered with new pictures in\nwhich the saints look more like Greek Gods than is strictly\nnecessary. He divides his time unevenly between affairs of\nstate and art. The affairs of state take ten percent of his time.\nThe other ninety percent goes to an active interest in Roman\nstatues, recently discovered Greek vases, plans for a new summer\nhome, the rehearsal of a new play. The Archbishops and\nthe Cardinals follow the example of their Pope. The Bishops\ntry to imitate the Archbishops. The village priests, however,\nhave remained faithful to their duties. They keep themselves\naloof from the wicked world and the heathenish love of beauty\nand pleasure. They stay away from the monasteries where\nthe monks seem to have forgotten their ancient vows of simplicity\nand poverty and live as happily as they dare without\ncausing too much of a public scandal.",
        "Finally, there are the common people. They are much\nbetter off than they have ever been before. They are more\nprosperous, they live in better houses, their children go to better\nschools, their cities are more beautiful than before, their\nfirearms have made them the equal of their old enemies, the\nrobber-barons, who for centuries have levied such heavy taxes\nupon their trade. So much for the chief actors in the\nReformation.",
        "Now let us see what the Renaissance has done to Europe,\nand then you will understand how the revival of learning and\nart was bound to be followed by a revival of religious interests.\nThe Renaissance began in Italy. From there it spread\nto France. It was not quite successful in Spain, where\nfive hundred years of warfare with the Moors had made the\npeople very narrow minded and very fanatical in all religious\nmatters. The circle had grown wider and wider, but once the\nAlps had been crossed, the Renaissance had suffered a change.",
        "The people of northern Europe, living in a very different\nclimate, had an outlook upon life which contrasted strangely\nwith that of their southern neighbours. The Italians lived out\nin the open, under a sunny sky. It was easy for them to laugh\nand to sing and to be happy. The Germans, the Dutch, the\nEnglish, the Swedes, spent most of their time indoors, listening\nto the rain beating on the closed windows of their comfortable\nlittle houses. They did not laugh quite so much. They\ntook everything more seriously. They were forever conscious\nof their immortal souls and they did not like to be funny about\nmatters which they considered holy and sacred. The “humanistic\"\npart of the Renaissance, the books, the studies of ancient\nauthors, the grammar and the text-books, interested them\ngreatly. But the general return to the old pagan civilisation\nof Greece and Rome, which was one of the chief results of the\nRenaissance in Italy, filled their hearts with horror.",
        "But the Papacy and the College of Cardinals was almost\nentirely composed of Italians and they had turned the Church\ninto a pleasant club where people discussed art and music and\nthe theatre, but rarely mentioned religion. Hence the split\nbetween the serious north and the more civilised but easy-going\nand indifferent south was growing wider and wider all the\ntime and nobody seemed to be aware of the danger that threatened\nthe Church.",
        "There were a few minor reasons which will explain why the\nReformation took place in Germany rather than in Sweden\nor England. The Germans bore an ancient grudge against\nRome. The endless quarrels between Emperor and Pope had\ncaused much mutual bitterness. In the other European countries\nwhere the government rested in the hands of a strong\nking, the ruler had often been able to protect his subjects\nagainst the greed of the priests. In Germany, where a shadowy\nemperor ruled a turbulent crowd of little princelings, the good\nburghers were more directly at the mercy of their bishops and\nprelates. These dignitaries were trying to collect large sums\nof money for the benefit of those enormous churches which\nwere a hobby of the Popes of the Renaissance. The Germans\nfelt that they were being mulcted and quite naturally they did\nnot like it.",
        "And then there is the rarely mentioned fact that Germany\nwas the home of the printing press. In northern Europe books\nwere cheap and the Bible was no longer a mysterious manu-\nscript owned and explained by the priest. It was a household\nbook of many families where Latin was understood by the\nfather and by the children. Whole families began to read it,\nwhich was against the law of the Church. They discovered that\nthe priests were telling them many things which, according to\nthe original text of the Holy Scriptures, were somewhat different.\nThis caused doubt. People began to ask questions. And\nquestions, when they cannot be answered, often cause a great\ndeal of trouble.",
        "The attack began when the humanists of the North opened\nfire upon the monks. In their heart of hearts they still had\ntoo much respect and reverence for the Pope to direct their\nsallies against his Most Holy Person. But the lazy, ignorant\nmonks, living behind the sheltering walls of their rich monasteries,\noffered rare sport.",
        "The leader in this warfare, curiously enough, was a very\nfaithful son of the church Gerard Gerardzoon, or Desiderius\nErasmus, as he is usually called, was a poor boy, born in\nRotterdam in Holland, and educated at the same Latin school\nof Deventer from which Thomas a Kempis had graduated.\nHe had become a priest and for a time he had lived in a monastery.\nHe had travelled a great deal and knew whereof he wrote,\nWhen he began his career as a public pamphleteer (he would\nhave been called an editorial writer in our day) the world was\ngreatly amused at an anonymous series of letters which had\njust appeared under the title of “Letters of Obscure Men.\"\nIn these letters, the general stupidity and arrogance of the\nmonks of the late Middle Ages was exposed in a strange\nGerman-Latin doggerel which reminds one of our modern\nlimericks. Erasmus himself was a very learned and serious\nscholar, who knew both Latin and Greek and gave us the first\nreliable version of the New Testament, which he translated\ninto Latin together with a corrected edition of the original\nGreek text. But he believed with Sallust, the Roman poet,\nthat nothing prevents us from “stating the truth with a smile\nupon our lips.”",
        "In the year 1500, while visiting Sir Thomas More in Eng-\nland, he took a few weeks off and wrote a funny little book,\ncalled the “Praise of Folly,” in which he attacked the monks\nand their credulous followers with that most dangerous of all\nweapons, humor. The booklet was the best seller of the sixteenth\ncentury. It was translated into almost every language\nand it made people pay attention to those other books of\nErasmus in which he advocated reform of the many abuses of\nthe church and appealed to his fellow humanists to help him\nin his task of bringing about a great rebirth of the Christian\nfaith.",
        "But nothing came of these excellent plans. Erasmus was\ntoo reasonable and too tolerant to please most of the enemies\nof the church. They were waiting for a leader of a more\nrobust nature.",
        "He came, and his name was Martin Luther.",
        "Luther was a North-German peasant with a first-class\nbrain and possessed of great personal courage. He was a\nuniversity man, a master of arts of the University of Erfurt;\nafterwards he joined a Dominican monastery. Then he became\na college professor at the theological school of Wittenberg\nand began to explain the scriptures to the indifferent ploughboys\nof his Saxon home. He had a lot of spare time and this he used\nto study the original texts of the Old and New Testaments.\nSoon he began to see the great difference which existed between\nthe words of Christ and those that were preached by the Popes and the Bishops.\nIn the year 1511, he visited Rome on official business.\nAlexander VI, of the family of Borgia, who had enriched himself\nfor the benefit of his son and daughter, was dead. But his\nsuccessor, Julius II, a man of irreproachable personal character,\nwas spending most of his time fighting and building and\ndid not impress this serious minded German theologian with\nhis piety. Luther returned to Wittenberg a much disappointed\nman. But worse was to follow.",
        "The gigantic church of St. Peter which Pope Julius had\nwished upon his innocent successors, although only half begun,\nwas already in need of repair. Alexander VI had spent every\npenny of the Papal treasury. Leo X, who succeeded Julius\nin the year 1513, was on the verge of bankruptcy. He reverted\nto an old method of raising ready cash. He began to sell\n\"indulgences.” An indulgence was a piece of parchment which\nin return for a certain sum of money, promised a sinner a decrease\nof the time which he would have to spend in purgatory.\nIt was a perfectly correct thing according to the creed of the\nlate Middle Ages. Since the church had the power to forgive\nthe sins of those who truly repented before they died, the\nchurch also had the right to shorten, through its intercession\nwith the Saints, the time during which the soul must be punfied\nin the shadowy realms of Purgatory.",
        "It was unfortunate that these Indulgences must be sold for\nmoney. But they offered an easy form of revenue and besides,\nthose who were too poor to pay, received theirs for nothing.",
        "Now it happened in the year 1517 that the exclusive territory\nfor the sale of indulgences in Saxony was given to a\nDominican monk by the name of Johan Tetzel. Brother\nJohan was a hustling salesman. To tell the truth he was a\nlittle too eager. His business methods outraged the pious\npeople of the little duchy. And Luther, who was an honest\nfellow, got so angry that he did a rash thing. On the 31st of\nOctober of the year 1517, he went to the court church and upon\nthe doors thereof he posted a sheet of paper with ninety-five\nstatements (or theses), attacking the sale of indulgences.\nThese statements had been written in Latin. Luther had no\nintention of starting a riot. He was not a revolutionist. He\nobjected to the institution of the Indulgences and he wanted his\nfellow professors to know what he thought about them. But\nthis was still a private affair of the clerical and professorial\nworld and there was no appeal to the prejudices of the community\nof laymen.",
        "Unfortunately, at that moment when the whole world had\nbegun to take an interest in the religious affairs of the day\nit was utterly impossible to discuss anything, without at once\ncreating a serious mental disturbance. In less than two\nmonths, all Europe was discussing the ninety-five theses of\nthe Saxon monk. Every one must take sides. Every obscure\nlittle theologian must print his own opinion. The papal\nauthorities began to be alarmed. They ordered the Wittenberg\nprofessor to proceed to Rome and give an account of his action.\nLuther wisely remembered what had happened to Huss. He\nstayed in Germany and he was punished with excommunication.\nLuther burned the papal bull in the presence of an\nadmiring multitude and from that moment, peace between himself\nand the Pope was no longer possible.",
        "Without any desire on his part, Luther had become the\nleader of a vast army of discontented Christians. German\npatriots like Ulrich von Hutten, rushed to his defence. The\nstudents of Wittenberg and Erfurt and Leipzig offered to\ndefend him should the authorities try to imprison him. The\nElector of Saxony reassured the eager young men. No harm\nwould befall Luther as long as he stayed on Saxon ground.",
        "All this happened in the year 1520. Charles V was twenty\nyears old and as the ruler of half the world, was forced to\nremain on pleasant terms with the Pope. He sent out calls\nfor a Diet or general assembly in the good city of Worms on\nthe Rhine and commanded Luther to be present and give an\naccount of his extraordinary behaviour. Luther, who now\nwas the national hero of the Germans, went. He refused to\ntake back a single word of what he had ever written or said.\nHis conscience was controlled only by the word of God. He\nwould live and die for his conscience",
        "The Diet of Worms, after due deliberation, declared\nLuther an outlaw before God and man, and forbade all Germans\nto give him shelter or food or drink, or to read a single\nword of the books which the dastardly heretic had written.\nBut the great reformer was in no danger. By the majority\nof the Germans of the north the edict was denounced as a most\nunjust and outrageous document. For greater safety, Luther\nwas hidden in the Wartburg, a castle belonging to the Elector\nof Saxony, and there he defied all papal authority by translating\nthe entire Bible into the German language, that all the\npeople might read and know the word of God for themselves.",
        "By this time, the Reformation was no longer a spiritual\nand religious affair. Those who hated the beauty of the modern\nchurch building used this period of unrest to attack and\ndestroy what they did not like because they did not understand\nit. Impoverished knights tried to make up for past losses by\ngrabbing the territory which belonged to the monasteries.\nDiscontented princes made use of the absence of the Emperor\nto increase their own power. The starving peasants, following\nthe leadership of half-crazy agitators, made the best of\nthe opportunity and attacked the castles of their masters and\nplundered and murdered and burned with the zeal of the old\nCrusaders.",
        "A veritable reign of disorder broke loose throughout the\nEmpire. Some princes became Protestants (as the “protesting\"\nadherents of Luther were called) and persecuted their\nCatholic subjects. Others remained Catholic and hanged their\nProtestant subjects. The Diet of Speyer of the year 1526\ntried to settle this difficult question of allegiance by ordering\nthat “the subjects should all be of the same religious denomination\nas their princes.” This turned Germany into a checkerboard\nof a thousand hostile little duchies and principalities and\ncreated a situation which prevented the normal political\ngrowth for hundreds of years.",
        "In February of the year 1546 Luther died and was put\nto rest in the same church where twenty-nine years before he\nhad proclaimed his famous objections to the sale of Indulgences.\nIn less than thirty years, the indifferent, joking and\nlaughing world of the Renaissance had been transformed into\nthe arguing, quarrelling, back-biting, debating-society of the\nReformation. The universal spiritual empire of the Popes\ncame to a sudden end and the whole Western Europe was\nturned into a battle-field, where Protestants and Catholics\nkilled each other for the greater glory of certain theological\ndoctrines which are as incomprehensible to the present generation\nas the mysterious inscriptions of the ancient Etruscans.",
        "THE AGE OF THE GREAT RELIGIOUS\nCONTROVERSIES",
        "THE sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the age of\nreligious controversy.",
        "If you will notice you will find that almost everybody\naround you is forever “talking economics” and discussing\nwages and hours of labor and strikes in their relation to the\nlife of the community, for that is the main topic of interest\nof our own time.",
        "The poor little children of the year 1600 or 1650 fared\nworse. They never heard anything but “religion.” Their\nheads were filled with “predestination,” “transubstantition,\"\n\"free will,” and a hundred other queer words, expressing\nobscure points of “the true faith,” whether Catholic or\nProtestant. According to the desire of their parents they were\nbaptised Catholics or Lutherans or Calvinists or Zwinglians\nor Anabaptists. They learned their theology from the Augsburg\ncatechism, composed by Luther, or from the “institutes\nof Christianity,” written by Calvin, or they mumbled the\nThirty-Nine Articles of Faith which were printed in the English\nBook of Common Prayer, and they were told that these\nalone represented the “True Faith.”",
        "They heard of the wholesale theft of church property\nperpetrated by King Henry VIII, the much-married monarch of\nEngland, who made himself the supreme head of the English\nchurch, and assumed the old papal rights of appointing bishops\nand priests. They had a nightmare whenever some one\nmentioned the Holy Inquisition, with its dungeons and its\nmany torture chambers, and they were treated to equally horrible\nstories of how a mob of outraged Dutch Protestants had\ngot hold of a dozen defenceless old priests and hanged them\nfor the sheer pleasure of killing those who professed\na different faith. It was unfortunate that the two\ncontending parties were so equally matched. Otherwise\nthe struggle would have come to a quick solution.\nNow it dragged on for eight generations, and\nit grew so complicated that I can only tell you the most\nimportant details, and must ask you to get the\nrest from one of the many histories of the Reformation.",
        "The great reform movement of the Protestants\nhad been followed by a thoroughgoing reform\nwithin the bosom of the Church. Those popes who\nhad been merely amateur humanists and dealers in Roman\nand Greek antiquities, disappeared from the scene and\ntheir place was taken by serious men who spent twenty hours\na day administering those holy duties which had been placed\nin their hands.",
        "The long and rather disgraceful happiness of the monasteries\ncame to an end. Monks and nuns were forced to be up\nat sunrise, to study the Church Fathers, to tend the sick and\nconsole the dying. The Holy Inquisition watched day and\nnight that no dangerous doctrines should be spread by way of\nthe printing press. Here it is customary to mention poor\nGalileo, who was locked up because he had been a little too\nindiscreet in explaining the heavens with his funny little\ntelescope and had muttered certain opinions about the behaviour\nof the planets which were entirely opposed to the official views\nof the church. But in all fairness to the Pope, the clergy and\nthe Inquisition, it ought to be stated that the Protestants were\nquite as much the enemies of science and medicine as the Catholics\nand with equal manifestations of ignorance and intolerance\nregarded the men who investigated things for themselves\nas the most dangerous enemies of mankind.",
        "And Calvin, the great French reformer and the tyrant\n(both political and spiritual) of Geneva, not only assisted the\nFrench authorities when they tried to hang Michael Servetus\n(the Spanish theologian and physician who had become famous\nas the assistant of Vesalius, the first great anatomist), but\nwhen Servetus had managed to escape from his French jail and\nhad fled to Geneva, Calvin threw this brilliant man into prison\nand after a prolonged trial, allowed him to be burned at the\nstake on account of his heresies, totally indifferent to his fame\nas a scientist.",
        "And so it went. We have few reliable statistics upon the\nsubject, but on the whole, the Protestants tired of this game\nlong before the Catholics, and the greater part of honest men\nand women who were burned and hanged and decapitated on\naccount of their religious beliefs fell as victims of the very\nenergetic but also very drastic church of Rome.",
        "For tolerance (and please remember this when you grow\nolder), is of very recent origin and even the people of our own\nso-called “modern world” are apt to be tolerant only upon such\nmatters as do not interest them very much. They are tolerant\ntowards a native of Africa, and do not care whether he becomes\na Buddhist or a Mohammedan, because neither Buddhism nor\nMohammedanism means anything to them. But when they\nhear that their neighbour who was a Republican and believed\nin a high protective tariff, has joined the Socialist party and\nnow wants to repeal all tariff laws, their tolerance ceases and\nthey use almost the same words as those employed by a kindly\nCatholic (or Protestant) of the seventeenth century, who was\ninformed that his best friend whom he had always respected\nand loved had fallen a victim to the terrible heresies of the\nProtestant (or Catholic) church.",
        "“Heresy” until a very short time ago was regarded as a\ndisease. Nowadays when we see a man neglecting the personal\ncleanliness of his body and his home and exposing himself\nand his children to the dangers of typhoid fever or another\npreventable disease, we send for the board-of-health and the\nhealth officer calls upon the police to aid him in removing this\nperson who is a danger to the safety of the entire community.\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a heretic, a man\nor a woman who openly doubted the fundamental principles\nupon which his Protestant or Catholic religion had been\nfounded, was considered a more terrible menace than a typhoid\ncarrier. Typhoid fever might (very likely would) destroy the\nbody. But heresy, according to them, would positively destroy\nthe immortal soul. It was therefore the duty of all good and\nlogical citizens to warn the police against the enemies of the\nestablished order of things and those who failed to do so were\nas culpable as a modern man who does not telephone to the\nnearest doctor when he discovers that his fellow-tenants are\nsuffering from cholera or small-pox.",
        "In the years to come you will hear a great deal about\npreventive medicine. Preventive medicine simply means that our\ndoctors do not wait until their patients are sick, then step\nforward and cure them. On the contrary, they study the patient\nand the conditions under which he lives when he (the patient)\nis perfectly well and they remove every possible cause of illness\nby cleaning up rubbish, by teaching him what to eat and what\nto avoid, and by giving him a few simple ideas of personal\nhygiene. They go even further than that, and these good\ndoctors enter the schools and teach the children how to use\ntooth-brushes and how to avoid catching colds.",
        "The sixteenth century which regarded (as I have tried to\nshow you) bodily illness as much less important than sickness\nwhich threatened the soul, organised a system of spiritual\npreventive medicine. As soon as a child was old enough to spell\nhis first words, he was educated in the true (and the “only\ntrue”) principles of the Faith. Indirectly this proved to be a\ngood thing for the general progress of the people of Europe.\nThe Protestant lands were soon dotted with schools. They\nused a great deal of very valuable time to explain the Catechism,\nbut they gave instruction in other things besides theology.\nThey encouraged reading and they were responsible\nfor the great prosperity of the printing trade.",
        "But the Catholics did not lag behind. They too devoted\nmuch time and thought to education. The Church, in this matter,\nfound an invaluable friend and ally in the newly-founded\norder of the Society of Jesus. The founder of this remarkable\norganisation was a Spanish soldier who after a life of unholy\nadventures had been converted and thereupon felt himself\nbound to serve the church just as many former sinners, who\nhave been shown the errors of their way by the Salvation Army,\ndevote the remaining years of their lives to the task of aiding\nand consoling those who are less fortunate.",
        "The name of this Spaniard was Ignatius de Loyola. He\nwas born in the year before the discovery of America. He had\nbeen wounded and lamed for life and while he was in the hospital\nhe had seen a vision of the Holy Virgin and her Son, who\nbade him give up the wickedness of his former life. He decided\nto go to the Holy Land and finish the task of the Crusades.\nBut a visit to Jerusalem had shown him the impossibility\nof the task and he returned west to help in the warfare\nupon the heresies of the Lutherans.",
        "In the year 1534 he was studying in Paris at the Sorbonne.\nTogether with seven other students he founded a fraternity.\nThe eight men promised each other that they would lead holy\nlives, that they would not strive after riches but after righteousness,\nand would devote themselves, body and soul, to the service\nof the Church. A few years later this small fraternity\nhad grown into a regular organisation and was recognised by\nPope Paul III as the Society of Jesus.",
        "Loyola had been a military man. He believed in discipline,\nand absolute obedience to the orders of the superior dignitaries\nbecame one of the main causes for the enormous success of the\nJesuits. They specialised in education. They gave their\nteachers a most thorough-going education before they allowed\nthem to talk to a single pupil. They lived with their students\nand they entered into their games. They watched them with\ntender care. And as a result they raised a new generation of\nfaithful Catholics who took their religious duties as seriously\nas the people of the early Middle Ages.",
        "The shrewd Jesuits, however, did not waste all their efforts\nupon the education of the poor. They entered the palaces\nof the mighty and became the private tutors of future emperors\nand kings. And what this meant you will see for yourself\nwhen I tell you about the Thirty Years War. But before\nthis terrible and final outbreak of religious fanaticism, a great\nmany other things had happened.",
        "Charles V was dead. Germany and Austria had been left\nto his brother Ferdinand. All his other possessions, Spain and\nthe Netherlands and the Indies and America had gone to his\nson Philip. Philip was the son of Charles and a Portuguese\nprincess who had been first cousin to her own husband. The\nchildren that are born of such a union are apt to be rather\nqueer. The son of Philip, the unfortunate Don Carlos, (murdered\nafterwards with his own father’s consent,) was crazy.\nPhilip was not quite crazy, but his zeal for the Church bordered\nclosely upon religious insanity. He believed that Heaven had\nappointed him as one of the saviours of mankind. Therefore,\nwhosoever was obstinate and refused to share his Majesty’s\nviews, proclaimed himself an enemy of the human race and\nmust be exterminated lest his example corrupt the souls of\nhis pious neighbours.",
        "Spain, of course, was a very rich country. All the gold and\nsilver of the new world flowed into the Castilian and Aragonian\ntreasuries. But Spain suffered from a curious eco-\nnomic disease. Her peasants were hard working men and\neven harder working women. But the better classes maintained\na supreme contempt for any form of labour, outside of\nemployment in the army or navy or the civil service. As for\nthe Moors, who had been very industrious artisans, they had\nbeen driven out of the country long before. As a result, Spain,\nthe treasure chest of the world, remained a poor country because\nall her money had to be sent abroad in exchange for the\nwheat and the other necessities of life which the Spaniards\nneglected to raise for themselves.",
        "Philip, ruler of the most powerful nation of the\nsixteenth century, depended for his revenue upon the taxes\nwhich were gathered in the busy commercial bee-hive of\nthe Netherlands. But these Flemings and Dutchmen were\ndevoted followers of the doctrines of Luther and Calvin\nand they had cleansed their churches of all images and holy\npaintings and they had informed the Pope that they no\nlonger regarded him as their shepherd but intended to follow\nthe dictates of their consciences and the commands of their\nnewly translated Bible.",
        "This placed the king in a very difficult position. He could\nnot possibly tolerate the heresies of his Dutch subjects, but\nhe needed their money. If he allowed them to be Protestants\nand took no measures to save their souls he was deficient in\nhis duty toward God. If he sent the Inquisition to the Netherlands\nand burned his subjects at the stake, he would lose the\ngreater part of his income.",
        "Being a man of uncertain will-power he hesitated a long\ntime. He tried kindness and sternness and promises and\nthreats. The Hollanders remained obstinate, and continued to\nsing psalms and listen to the sermons of their Lutheran and\nCalvinist preachers. Philip in his despair sent his “man of\niron,” the Duke of Alba, to bring these hardened sinners to\nterms. Alba began by decapitating those leaders who had not\nwisely left the country before his arrival. In the year 1572\n(the same year that the French Protestant leaders were all\nkilled during the terrible night of Saint Bartholomew), he\nattacked a number of Dutch cities and massacred the inhabitants\nas an example for the others. The next year he laid siege\nto the town of Leyden, the manufacturing center of Holland.",
        "Meanwhile, the seven small provinces of the northern\nNetherlands had formed a defensive union, the so-called union\nof Utrecht, and had recognised William of Orange, a German\nprince who had been the private secretary of the Emperor\nCharles V, as the leader of their army and as commander of\ntheir freebooting sailors, who were known as the Beggars of\nthe Sea. William, to save Leyden, cut the dykes, created a\nshallow inland sea, and delivered the town with the help of a\nstrangely equipped navy consisting of scows and flat-bottomed\nbarges which were rowed and pushed and pulled through the\nmud until they reached the city walls.",
        "It was the first time that an army of the invincible Spanish\nking had suffered such a humiliating defeat. It surprised the\nworld just as the Japanese victory of Mukden, in the Russian-\nJapanese war, surprised our own generation. The Protestant\npowers took fresh courage and Philip devised new means for\nthe purpose of conquering his rebellious subjects. He hired\na poor half-witted fanatic to go and murder William of\nOrange. But the sight of their dead leader did not bring the\nSeven Provinces to their knees. On the contrary it made them\nfuriously angry. In the year 1581, the Estates General (the\nmeeting of the representatives of the Seven Provinces) came\ntogether at the Hague and most solemnly abjured their\n\"wicked king Philip” and themselves assumed the burden\nof sovereignty which thus far had been invested in their\n\"King by the Grace of God.”",
        "This is a very important event in the history of the great\nstruggle for political liberty. It was a step which reached\nmuch further than the uprising of the nobles which ended with\nthe signing of the Magna Carta. These good burghers said\n\"Between a king and his subjects there is a silent understanding\nthat both sides shall perform certain services and shall\nrecognise certain definite duties. If either party fails to live\nup to this contract, the other has the right to consider it ter-\nminated.” The American subjects of King George III in\nthe year 1776 came to a similar conclusion. But they had three\nthousand miles of ocean between themselves and their ruler\nand the Estates General took their decision (which meant a\nslow death in case of defeat) within hearing of the Spanish\nguns and although in constant fear of an avenging Spanish\nfleet.",
        "The stories about a mysterious Spanish fleet that was to conquer\nboth Holland and England, when Protestant Queen\nElizabeth had succeeded Catholic “Bloody Mary” was an old\none. For years the sailors of the waterfront had talked\nabout it. In the eighties of the sixteenth century, the\nrumour took a definite shape. According to pilots who had\nbeen in Lisbon, all the Spanish and Portuguese wharves were\nbuilding ships. And in the southern Netherlands (in Belgium)\nthe Duke of Parma was collecting a large expeditionary\nforce to be carried from Ostend to London and Amsterdam\nas soon as the fleet should arrive.",
        "In the year 1586 the Great Armada set sail for the north.\nBut the harbours of the Flemish coast were blockaded by a\nDutch fleet and the Channel was guarded by the English, and\nthe Spaniards, accustomed to the quieter seas of the south, did\nnot know how to navigate in this squally and bleak northern\nclimate. What happened to the Armada once it was attacked\nby ships and by storms I need not tell you. A few ships, by\nsailing around Ireland, escaped to tell the terrible story of\ndefeat. The others perished and lie at the bottom of the North\nSea.",
        "Turn about is fair play. The British nod the Dutch Prot-\nestants now carried the war into the territory of the enemy.\nBefore the end of the century, Houtman, with the help of a\nbooklet written by Linschoten (a Hollander who had been in\nthe Portuguese service), had at last discovered the route to\nthe Indies. As a result the great Dutch East India Company\nwas founded and a systematic war upon the Portuguese and\nSpanish colonies in Asia and Africa was begun in all seriousness.",
        "It was during this early era of colonial conquest that a\ncurious lawsuit was fought out in the Dutch courts. Early in\nthe seventeenth century a Dutch Captain by the name of van\nHeemskerk, a man who had made himself famous as the head\nof an expedition which had tried to discover the North Eastern\nPassage to the Indies and who had spent a winter on the frozen\nshores of the island of Nova Zembla, had captured a Portuguese\nship in the straits of Malacca. You will remember that\nthe Pope had divided the world into two equal shares, one of\nwhich had been given to the Spaniards and the other to the\nPortuguese. The Portuguese quite naturally regarded the\nwater which surrounded their Indian islands as part of their\nown property and since, for the moment, they were not at war\nwith the United Seven Netherlands, they claimed that the\ncaptain of a private Dutch trading company had no right to\nenter their private domain and steal their ships. And they\nbrought suit. The directors of the Dutch East India Company\nhired a bright young lawyer, by the name of De Groot or\nGrotius, to defend their case. He made the astonishing plea\nthat the ocean is free to all comers. Once outside the distance\nwhich a cannon ball fired from the land can reach, the sea is\nor (according to Grotius) ought to be, a free and open highway\nto all the ships of all nations. It was the first time that this\nstartling doctrine had been publicly pronounced in a court\nof law. It was opposed by all the other seafaring people. To\ncounteract the effect of Grotius’ famous plea for the “Mare\nLiberum,” or “Open Sea,” John Selden, the Englishman,\nwrote his famous treatise upon the “Mare Clausum” or “Closed\nSea” which treated of the natural right of a sovereign to regard\nthe seas which surrounded his country as belonging to his territory.\nI mention this here because the question had not yet\nbeen decided and during the last war caused all sorts of\ndifficulties and complications.",
        "To return to the warfare between Spaniard and Hollander\nand Englishman, before twenty years were over the most\nvaluable colonies of the Indies and the Cape of Good Hope and\nCeylon and those along the coast of China and even Japan were\nin Protestant hands. In 1621 a West Indian Company was\nfounded which conquered Brazil and in North America built\na fortress called Nieuw Amsterdam at the mouth of the river\nwhich Henry Hudson had discovered in the year 1609",
        "These new colonies enriched both England and the Dutch\nRepublic to such an extent that they could hire foreign soldiers\nto do their fighting on land while they devoted themselves\nto commerce and trade. To them the Protestant revolt meant\nindependence and prosperity. But in many other parts of\nEurope it meant a succession of horrors compared to which the\nlast war was a mild excursion of kindly Sunday-school boys.",
        "The Thirty Years War which broke out in the year 1618\nand which ended with the famous treaty of Westphalia in 1648\nwas the perfectly natural result of a century of ever increasing\nreligious hatred. It was, as I have said, a terrible war. Everybody\nfought everybody else and the struggle ended only when\nall parties had been thoroughly exhausted and could fight no\nlonger.",
        "In less than a generation it turned many parts of central\nEurope into a wilderness, where the hungry peasants fought\nfor the carcass of a dead horse with the even hungrier wolf.\nFive-sixths of all the German towns and villages were destroyed.\nThe Palatinate, in western Germany, was plundered\ntwenty-eight times. And a population of eighteen million\npeople was reduced to four million.",
        "The hostilities began almost as soon as Ferdinand II of\nthe House of Habsburg had been elected Emperor. He was\nthe product of a most careful Jesuit training and was a most\nobedient and devout son of the Church. The vow which he had\nmade as a young man, that he would eradicate all sects and\nall heresies from his domains, Ferdinand kept to the best of\nhis ability. Two days before his election, his chief opponent,\nFrederick, the Protestant Elector of the Palatinate and a\nson-in-law of James I of England, had been made King of\nBohemia, in direct violation of Ferdinand’s wishes.",
        "At once the Habsburg armies marched into Bohemia. The\nyoung king looked in vain for assistance against this formidable\nenemy. The Dutch Republic was willing to help, but,\nengaged in a desperate war of its own with the Spanish branch\nof the Habsburgs, it could do little. The Stuarts in England\nwere more interested in strengthening their own absolute power\nat home than spending money and men upon a forlorn adventure\nin far away Bohemia. After a struggle of a few months,\nthe Elector of the Palatinate was driven away and his domains\nwere given to the Catholic house of Bavaria. This was the beginning\nof the great war.",
        "Then the Habsburg armies, under Tilly and Wallenstein,\nfought their way through the Protestant part of Germany\nuntil they had reached the shores of the Baltic. A Catholic\nneighbour meant serious danger to the Protestant king of\nDenmark. Christian IV tried to defend himself by attacking\nhis enemies before they had become too strong for him. The\nDanish armies marched into Germany but were defeated.\nWallenstein followed up his victory with such energy and violence\nthat Denmark was forced to sue for peace. Only one\ntown of the Baltic then remained in the hands of the Protestants.\nThat was Stralsund.",
        "There, in the early summer of the year 1630, landed King\nGustavus Adolphus of the house of Vasa, king of Sweden,\nand famous as the man who had defended his country against\nthe Russians. A Protestant prince of unlimited ambition,\ndesirous of making Sweden the centre of a great Northern\nEmpire, Gustavus Adolphus was welcomed by the Protestant\nprinces of Europe as the saviour of the Lutheran cause. He\ndefeated Tilly, who had just successfully butchered the Protestant\ninhabitants of Magdeburg. Then his troops began their\ngreat march through the heart of Germany in an attempt to\nreach the Habsburg possessions in Italy. Threatened in the\nrear by the Catholics, Gustavus suddenly veered around and\ndefeated the main Habsburg army in the battle of Lutzen.\nUnfortunately the Swedish king was killed when he strayed\naway from his troops. But the Habsburg power had been\nbroken.",
        "Ferdinand, who was a suspicious sort of person, at once\nbegan to distrust his own servants. Wallenstein, his commander-\nin-chief, was murdered at his instigation. When the\nCatholic Bourbons, who ruled France and hated their Habsburg\nrivals, heard of this, they joined the Protestant Swedes.\nThe armies of Louis XIII invaded the eastern part of Germany,\nand Turenne and Conde added their fame to that of\nBaner and Weimar, the Swedish generals, by murdering, pillaging\nand burning Habsburg property. This brought great\nfame and riches to the Swedes and caused the Danes to become\nenvious. The Protestant Danes thereupon declared war upon\nthe Protestant Swedes who were the allies of the Catholic\nFrench, whose political leader, the Cardinal de Richelieu, had\njust deprived the Huguenots (or French Protestants) of those\nrights of public worship which the Edict of Nantes of the year\n1598 had guaranteed them.",
        "The war, after the habit of such encounters, did not decide\nanything, when it came to an end with the treaty of Westphalia\nin 1648. The Catholic powers remained Catholic and\nthe Protestant powers stayed faithful to the doctrines of\nLuther and Calvin and Zwingli. The Swiss and Dutch Protestants\nwere recognised as independent republics. France\nkept the cities of Metz and Toul and Verdun and a part of the\nAlsace. The Holy Roman Empire continued to exist as a sort\nof scare-crow state, without men, without money, without hope\nand without courage.",
        "The only good the Thirty Years War accomplished was a\nnegative one. It discouraged both Catholics and Protestants\nfrom ever trying it again. Henceforth they left each other in\npeace. This however did not mean that religious feeling and\ntheological hatred had been removed from this earth. On the\ncontrary. The quarrels between Catholic and Protestant\ncame to an end, but the disputes between the different Protestant\nsects continued as bitterly as ever before. In Holland\na difference of opinion as to the true nature of predestination\n(a very obscure point of theology, but exceedingly important\nthe eyes of your great-grandfather) caused a quarrel which\nended with the decapitation of John of Oldenbarneveldt, the\nDutch statesman, who had been responsible for the success of\nthe Republic during the first twenty years of its independence,\nand who was the great organising genius of her Indian trading\ncompany. In England, the feud led to civil war.",
        "But before I tell you of this outbreak which led to the first\nexecution by process-of-law of a European king, I ought to\nsay something about the previous history of England. In this\nbook I am trying to give you only those events of the past\nwhich can throw a light upon the conditions of the present\nworld. If I do not mention certain countries, the cause is not\nto be found in any secret dislike on my part. I wish that I\ncould tell you what happened to Norway and Switzerland and\nSerbia and China. But these lands exercised no great influence\nupon the development of Europe in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries. I therefore pass them by with a polite\nand very respectful bow. England however is in a different\nposition. What the people of that small island have done during\nthe last five hundred years has shaped the course of history\nin every corner of the world. Without a proper knowledge of\nthe background of English history, you cannot understand\nwhat you read in the newspapers. And it is therefore necessary\nthat you know how England happened to develop a parliamentary\nform of government while the rest of the European continent\nwas still ruled by absolute monarchs.",
        "HOW THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE “DIVINE\nRIGHT” OF KINGS AND THE LESS DIVINE\nBUT MORE REASONABLE “RIGHT OF\nPARLIAMENT” ENDED DISASTROUSLY FOR\nKING CHARLES II",
        "CAESAR, the earliest explorer of north-western Europe, had\ncrossed the Channel in the year 55 B.C. and had conquered\nEngland. During four centuries the country then remained\na Roman province. But when the Barbarians began to\nthreaten Rome, the garrisons were called back from the frontier\nthat they might defend the home country and Britannia\nwas left without a government and without protection.",
        "As soon as this became known among the hungry Saxon\ntribes of northern Germany, they sailed across the North Sea\nand made themselves at home in the prosperous island. They\nfounded a number of independent Anglo-Saxon kingdoms\n(so called after the original Angles or English and the Saxon\ninvaders) but these small states were for ever quarrelling with\neach other and no King was strong enough to establish himself\nas the head of a united country. For more than five hundred\nyears, Mercia and Northumbria and Wessex and Sussex\nand Kent and East Anglia, or whatever their names, were\nexposed to attacks from various Scandinavian pirates. Finally\nin the eleventh century, England, together with Norway and\nnorthern Germany became part of the large Danish Empire\nof Canute the Great and the last vestiges of independence\ndisappeared.",
        "The Danes, in the course of time, were driven away but no\nsooner was England free, than it was conquered for the fourth\ntime. The new enemies were the descendants of another tribe\nof Norsemen who early in the tenth century had invaded\nFrance and had founded the Duchy of Normandy. William,\nDuke of Normandy, who for a long time had looked across the\nwater with an envious eye, crossed the Channel in October\nof the year 1066. At the battle of Hastings, on October the\nfourteenth of that year, he destroyed the weak forces of Harold\nof Wessex, the last of the Anglo-Saxon Kings and established\nhimself as King of England. But neither William nor his\nsuccessors of the House of Anjou and Plantagenet regarded\nEngland as their true home. To them the island was merely a\npart of their great inheritance on the continent–a sort of\ncolony inhabited by rather backward people upon whom they\nforced their own language and civilisation. Gradually however\nthe “colony” of England gained upon the “Mother\ncountry” of Normandy. At the same time the Kings of\nFrance were trying desperately to get rid of the powerful Norman-\nEnglish neighbours who were in truth no more than disobedient\nservants of the French crown. After a century of war\nfare the French people, under the leadership of a young girl by\nthe name of Joan of Arc, drove the “foreigners” from their\nsoil. Joan herself, taken a prisoner at the battle of Compiegne\nin the year 1430 and sold by her Burgundian captors to the\nEnglish soldiers, was burned as a witch. But the English\nnever gained foothold upon the continent and their Kings were\nat last able to devote all their time to their British possessions.\nAs the feudal nobility of the island had been engaged in one of\nthose strange feuds which were as common in the middle ages\nas measles and small-pox, and as the greater part of the old\nlanded proprietors had been killed during these so-called Wars\nof the Roses, it was quite easy for the Kings to increase their\nroyal power. And by the end of the fifteenth century, England\nwas a strongly centralised country, ruled by Henry VII\nof the House of Tudor, whose famous Court of Justice, the\n\"Star Chamber” of terrible memory, suppressed all attempts\non the part of the surviving nobles to regain their old influence\nupon the government of the country with the utmost severity.",
        "In the year 1509 Henry VII was succeeded by his son\nHenry VIII, and from that moment on the history of England\ngained a new importance for the country ceased to be a\nmediaeval island and became a modern state.",
        "Henry had no deep interest in religion. He gladly used a\nprivate disagreement with the Pope about one of his many\ndivorces to declare himself independent of Rome and make\nthe church of England the first of those “nationalistic churches\"\nin which the worldly ruler also acts as the spiritual head of his\nsubjects. This peaceful reformation of 1034 not only gave\nthe house of Tudor the support of the English clergy, who\nfor a long time had been exposed to the violent attacks of many\nLutheran propagandists, but it also increased the Royal power\nthrough the confiscation of the former possessions of the\nmonasteries. At the same time it made Henry popular with the\nmerchants and tradespeople, who as the proud and prosperous\ninhabitants of an island which was separated from the rest of\nEurope by a wide and deep channel, had a great dislike for\neverything “foreign” and did not want an Italian bishop to rule\ntheir honest British souls.",
        "In 1517 Henry died. He left the throne to his small son,\naged ten. The guardians of the child, favoring the modern\nLutheran doctrines, did their best to help the cause of Protestantism.\nBut the boy died before he was sixteen, and was succeeded\nby his sister Mary, the wife of Philip II of Spain, who\nburned the bishops of the new “national church” and in other\nways followed the example of her royal Spanish husband",
        "Fortunately she died, in the year 1558, and was succeeded\nby Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn,\nthe second of his six wives, whom he had decapitated when she\nno longer pleased him. Elizabeth, who had spent some time in\nprison, and who had been released only at the request of the\nHoly Roman Emperor, was a most cordial enemy of everything\nCatholic and Spanish. She shared her father’s indifference\nin the matter of religion but she inherited his ability as a\nvery shrewd judge of character, and spent the forty-five years\nof her reign in strengthening the power of the dynasty and in\nincreasing the revenue and possessions of her merry islands.\nIn this she was most ably assisted by a number of men who\ngathered around her throne and made the Elizabethan age a\nperiod of such importance that you ought to study it in detail\nin one of the special books of which I shall tell you in the\nbibliography at the end of this volume.",
        "Elizabeth, however, did not feel entirely safe upon her\nthrone. She had a rival and a very dangerous one. Mary,\nof the house of Stuart, daughter of a French duchess and a\nScottish father, widow of king Francis II of France and\ndaughter-in-law of Catherine of Medici (who had organised\nthe murders of Saint Bartholomew’s night), was the mother of\na little boy who was afterwards to become the first Stuart king\nof England. She was an ardent Catholic and a willing friend\nto those who were the enemies of Elizabeth. Her own lack\nof political ability and the violent methods which she employed\nto punish her Calvinistic subjects, caused a revolution in Scotland\nand forced Mary to take refuge on English territory. For\neighteen years she remained in England, plotting forever and\na day against the woman who had given her shelter and who\nwas at last obliged to follow the advice of her trusted councilors\n\"to cutte off the Scottish Queen’s heade.”",
        "The head was duly “cutte off” in the year 1587 and caused\na war with Spain. But the combined navies of England and\nHolland defeated Philip’s Invincible Armada, as we have already\nseen, and the blow which had been meant to destroy the\npower of the two great anti-Catholic leaders was turned into a\nprofitable business adventure.",
        "For now at last, after many years of hesitation, the English\nas well as the Dutch thought it their good right to invade\nthe Indies and America and avenge the ills which their Protes-\ntent brethren had suffered at the hands of the Spaniards. The\nEnglish had been among the earliest successors of Columbus.\nBritish ships, commanded by the Venetian pilot Giovanni Caboto\n(or Cabot), had been the first to discover and explore the\nnorthern American continent in 1496. Labrador and Newfoundland\nwere of little importance as a possible colony. But\nthe banks of Newfoundland offered a rich reward to the\nEnglish fishing fleet. A year later, in 1497, the same Cabot\nhad explored the coast of Florida.",
        "Then had come the busy years of Henry VII and Henry\nVIII when there had been no money for foreign explorations.\nBut under Elizabeth, with the country at peace and Mary\nStuart in prison, the sailors could leave their harbour without\nfear for the fate of those whom they left behind. While Elizabeth\nwas still a child, Willoughby had ventured to sail past the\nNorth Cape and one of his captains, Richard Chancellor, pushing\nfurther eastward in his quest of a possible road to the Indies,\nhad reached Archangel, Russia, where he had established\ndiplomatic and commercial relations with the mysterious rulers\nof this distant Muscovite Empire. During the first years of\nElizabeth’s rule this voyage had been followed up by many\nothers. Merchant adventurers, working for the benefit of a\n\"joint stock Company” had laid the foundations of trading\ncompanies which in later centuries were to become colonies.\nHalf pirate, half diplomat, willing to stake everything on a\nsingle lucky voyage, smugglers of everything that could be\nloaded into the hold of a vessel, dealers in men and merchandise\nwith equal indifference to everything except their profit, the\nsailors of Elizabeth had carried the English flag and the fame\nof their Virgin Queen to the four corners of the Seven Seas.\nMeanwhile William Shakespeare kept her Majesty amused at\nhome, and the best brains and the best wit of England co-operated\nwith the queen in her attempt to change the feudal inheritance\nof Henry VIII into a modern national state.",
        "In the year 1603 the old lady died at the age of seventy.\nHer cousin, the great-grandson of her own grandfather Henry\nVII and son of Mary Stuart, her rival and enemy, succeeded\nher as James I. By the Grace of God, he found himself the\nruler of a country which had escaped the fate of its continental\nrivals. While the European Protestants and Catholics were\nkilling each other in a hopeless attempt to break the power of\ntheir adversaries and establish the exclusive rule of their own\nparticular creed, England was at peace and “reformed” at\nleisure without going to the extremes of either Luther or\nLoyola. It gave the island kingdom an enormous advantage in\nthe coming struggle for colonial possessions. It assured England\na leadership in international affairs which that country\nhas maintained until the present day. Not even the disastrous\nadventure with the Stuarts was able to stop this normal development.",
        "The Stuarts, who succeeded the Tudors, were “foreigners\"\nin England. They do not seem to have appreciated or understood\nthis fact. The native house of Tudor could steal a horse,\nbut the “foreign” Stuarts were not allowed to look at the\nbridle without causing great popular disapproval. Old Queen\nBess had ruled her domains very much as she pleased. In\ngeneral however, she had always followed a policy which meant\nmoney in the pocket of the honest (and otherwise) British\nmerchants. Hence the Queen had been always assured of the\nwholehearted support of her grateful people. And small liberties\ntaken with some of the rights and prerogatives of Parliament\nwere gladly overlooked for the ulterior benefits which\nwere derived from her Majesty’s strong and successful foreign\npolicies.",
        "Outwardly King James continued the same policy. But he\nlacked that personal enthusiasm which had been so very typical\nof his great predecessor. Foreign commerce continued to be\nencouraged. The Catholics were not granted any liberties.\nBut when Spain smiled pleasantly upon England in an effort\nto establish peaceful relations, James was seen to smile back.\nThe majority of the English people did not like this, but\nJames was their King and they kept quiet.",
        "Soon there were other causes of friction. King James and\nhis son, Charles I, who succeeded him in the year 1625 both\nfirmly believed in the principle of their “divine right” to\nadminister their realm as they thought fit without consulting the\nwishes of their subjects. The idea was not new. The Popes,\nwho in more than one way had been the successors of the\nRoman Emperors (or rather of the Roman Imperial ideal of\na single and undivided state covering the entire known world),\nhad always regarded themselves and had been publicly recognised\nas the “Vice-Regents of Christ upon Earth.” No one\nquestioned the right of God to rule the world as He saw fit.\nAs a natural result, few ventured to doubt the right of the\ndivine “Vice-Regent” to do the same thing and to demand the\nobedience of the masses because he was the direct representative\nof the Absolute Ruler of the Universe and responsible\nonly to Almighty God.",
        "When the Lutheran Reformation proved successful, those\nrights which formerly had been invested in the Papacy were\ntaken over by the many European sovereigns who became\nProtestants. As head of their own national or dynastic\nchurches they insisted upon being “Christ’s Vice-Regents\"\nwithin the limit of their own territory. The people did not question\nthe right of their rulers to take such a step. They accepted\nit, just as we in our own day accept the idea of a representative\nsystem which to us seems the only reasonable and just\nform of government. It is unfair therefore to state that either\nLutheranism or Calvinism caused the particular feeling of\nirritation which greeted King-James’s oft and loudly repeated\nassertion of his “Divine Right.” There must have been other\ngrounds for the genuine English disbelief in the Divine Right\nof Kings.",
        "The first positive denial of the “Divine Right” of sovereigns\nhad been heard in the Netherlands when the Estates General\nabjured their lawful sovereign King Philip II of Spain, in the\nyear 1581. “The King,” so they said, “has broken his contract\nand the King therefore is dismissed like any other unfaithful\nservant.” Since then, this particular idea of a king’s\nresponsibilities towards his subjects had spread among many of the\nnations who inhabited the shores of the North Sea. They were\nin a very favourable position. They were rich. The poor people\nin the heart of central Europe, at the mercy of their\nRuler’s body-guard, could not afford to discuss a problem\nwhich would at once land them in the deepest dungeon of the\nnearest castle. But the merchants of Holland and England\nwho possessed the capital necessary for the maintenance of\ngreat armies and navies, who knew how to handle the almighty\nweapon called “credit,” had no such fear. They were willing\nto pit the “Divine Right” of their own good money against\nthe “Divine Right” of any Habsburg or Bourbon or Stuart.\nThey knew that their guilders and shillings could beat the\nclumsy feudal armies which were the only weapons of the King.\nThey dared to act, where others were condemned to suffer\nin silence or run the risk of the scaffold.",
        "When the Stuarts began to annoy the people of England\nwith their claim that they had a right to do what they pleased\nand never mind the responsibility, the English middle classes\nused the House of Commons as their first line of defence\nagainst this abuse of the Royal Power. The Crown refused to\ngive in and the King sent Parliament about its own business.\nEleven long years, Charles I ruled alone. He levied taxes\nwhich most people regarded as illegal and he managed his\nBritish kingdom as if it had been his own country estate. He\nhad capable assistants and we must say that he had the courage\nof his convictions.",
        "Unfortunately, instead of assuring himself of the support\nof his faithful Scottish subjects, Charles became involved in\na quarrel with the Scotch Presbyterians. Much against his\nwill, but forced by his need for ready cash, Charles was at\nlast obliged to call Parliament together once more. It met in\nApril of 1640 and showed an ugly temper. It was dissolved\na few weeks later. A new Parliament convened in November.\nThis one was even less pliable than the first one. The members\nunderstood that the question of “Government by Divine\nRight” or “Government by Parliament” must be fought out\nfor good and all. They attacked the King in his chief councillors\nand executed half a dozen of them. They announced that\nthey would not allow themselves to be dissolved without their\nown approval. Finally on December 1, 1641, they presented\nto the King a “Grand Remonstrance” which gave a detailed\naccount of the many grievances of the people against their Ruler.",
        "Charles, hoping to derive some support for his own policy\nin the country districts, left London in January of 1642. Each\nside organised an army and prepared for open warfare between\nthe absolute power of the crown and the absolute power\nof Parliament. During this struggle, the most powerful religious\nelement of England, called the Puritans, (they were\nAnglicans who had tried to purify their doctrines to the most\nabsolute limits), came quickly to the front. The regiments of\n\"Godly men,” commanded by Oliver Cromwell, with their\niron discipline and their profound confidence in the holiness of\ntheir aims, soon became the model for the entire army of the\nopposition. Twice Charles was defeated. After the battle\nof Naseby, in 1645, he fled to Scotland. The Scotch sold him\nto the English.",
        "There followed a period of intrigue and an uprising\nof the Scotch Presbyterians against the English Puritan.\nIn August of the year 1648 after the three-days’ battle of\nPreston Pans, Cromwell made an end to this second civil war,\nand took Edinburgh. Meanwhile his soldiers, tired of further\ntalk and wasted hours of religious debate, had decided to act\non their own initiative. They removed from Parliament all\nthose who did not agree with their own Puritan views. Thereupon\nthe “Rump,” which was what was left of the old Parliament,\naccused the King of high treason. The House of Lords\nrefused to sit as a tribunal. A special tribunal was appointed\nand it condemned the King to death. On the 30th of January\nof the year 1649, King Charles walked quietly out of a window\nof White Hall onto the scaffold. That day, the Sovereign\nPeople, acting through their chosen representatives, for the\nfirst time executed a ruler who had failed to understand his own\nposition in the modern state.",
        "The period which followed the death of Charles is usually\ncalled after Oliver Cromwell. At first the unofficial Dictator\nof England, he was officially made Lord Protector in the year\n1653. He ruled five years. He used this period to continue\nthe policies of Elizabeth. Spain once more became the arch\nenemy of England and war upon the Spaniard was made a national\nand sacred issue.",
        "The commerce of England and the interests of the traders\nwere placed before everything else, and the Protestant creed of\nthe strictest nature was rigourously maintained. In maintaining\nEngland’s position abroad, Cromwell was successful. As a\nsocial reformer, however, he failed very badly. The world is\nmade up of a number of people and they rarely think alike.\nIn the long run, this seems a very wise provision. A government\nof and by and for one single part of the entire community\ncannot possibly survive. The Puritans had been a great\nforce for good when they tried to correct the abuse of the\nroyal power. As the absolute Rulers of England they became\nintolerable.",
        "When Cromwell died in 1658, it was an easy matter for the\nStuarts to return to their old kingdom. Indeed, they were\nwelcomed as “deliverers” by the people who had found the\nyoke of the meek Puritans quite as hard to bear as that of autocratic\nKing Charles. Provided the Stuarts were willing to forget\nabout the Divine Right of their late and lamented father\nand were willing to recognise the superiority of Parliament, the\npeople promised that they would be loyal and faithful subjects.",
        "Two generations tried to make a success of this new arrangement.\nBut the Stuarts apparently had not learned their\nlesson and were unable to drop their bad habits. Charles II,\nwho came back in the year 1660, was an amiable but worthless\nperson. His indolence and his constitutional insistence upon\nfollowing the easiest course, together with his conspicuous success\nas a liar, prevented an open outbreak between himself and\nhis people. By the act of Uniformity in 1662 he broke the\npower of the Puritan clergy by banishing all dissenting clergymen\nfrom their parishes. By the so-called Conventicle Act of\n1664 he tried to prevent the Dissenters from attending religious\nmeetings by a threat of deportation to the West Indies. This\nlooked too much like the good old days of Divine Right. People\nbegan to show the old and well-known signs of impatience,\nand Parliament suddenly experienced difficulty in providing\nthe King with funds.",
        "Since he could not get money from an unwilling Parliament,\nCharles borrowed it secretly from his neighbour and cousin\nKing Louis of France. He betrayed his Protestant allies in\nreturn for 200,000 pounds per year, and laughed at the poor\nsimpletons of Parliament.",
        "Economic independence suddenly gave the King great faith\nin his own strength. He had spent many years of exile among\nhis Catholic relations and he had a secret liking for their\nreligion. Perhaps he could bring England back to Rome! He\npassed a Declaration of Indulgence which suspended the old\nlaws against the Catholics and Dissenters. This happened just\nwhen Charles’ younger brother James was said to have become\na Catholic. All this looked suspicious to the man in the street\nPeople began to fear some terrible Popish plot. A new spirit\nof unrest entered the land. Most of the people wanted to prevent\nanother outbreak of civil war. To them Royal Oppression\nand a Catholic King–yea, even Divine Right,–were\npreferable to a new struggle between members of the same\nrace. Others however were less lenient. They were the much-\nfeared Dissenters, who invariably had the courage of their\nconvictions. They were led by several great noblemen who did\nnot want to see a return of the old days of absolute royal\npower.",
        "For almost ten years, these two great parties, the Whigs\n(the middle class element, called by this derisive name be-\ncause in the year 1640 a lot of Scottish Whiggamores or horse-\ndrovers headed by the Presbyterian clergy, had marched to\nEdinburgh to oppose the King) and the Tories (an epithet\noriginally used against the Royalist Irish adherents but now\napplied to the supporters of the King) opposed each other, but\nneither wished to bring about a crisis. They allowed Charles to\ndie peacefully in his bed and permitted the Catholic James II\nto succeed his brother in 1685. But when James, after threatening\nthe country with the terrible foreign invention of a “standing\narmy” (which was to be commanded by Catholic Frenchmen),\nissued a second Declaration of Indulgence in 1688, and\nordered it to be read in all Anglican churches, he went just a\ntrifle beyond that line of sensible demarcation which can only be\ntransgressed by the most popular of rulers under very\nexceptional circumstances. Seven bishops refused to comply\nwith the Royal Command. They were accused of “seditious\nlibel.” They were brought before a court. The jury which\npronounced the verdict of “not guilty” reaped a rich harvest\nof popular approval.",
        "At this unfortunate moment, James (who in a second marriage\nhad taken to wife Maria of the Catholic house of Modena-\nEste) became the father of a son. This meant that the throne\nwas to go to a Catholic boy rather than to his older sisters,\nMary and Anne, who were Protestants. The man in the street\nagain grew suspicious. Maria of Modena was too old to have\nchildren! It was all part of a plot! A strange baby had been\nbrought into the palace by some Jesuit priest that England\nmight have a Catholic monarch. And so on. It looked as if\nanother civil war would break out. Then seven well-known\nmen, both Whigs and Tories, wrote a letter asking the husband\nof James’s oldest daughter Mary, William III the Stadtholder\nor head of the Dutch Republic, to come to England and\ndeliver the country from its lawful but entirely undesirable\nsovereign.",
        "On the fifth of November of the year 1688, William landed\nat Torbay. As he did not wish to make a martyr out of his\nfather-in-law, he helped him to escape safely to France. On\nthe 22nd of January of 1689 he summoned Parliament. On\nthe 13th of February of the same year he and his wife Mary\nwere proclaimed joint sovereigns of England and the country\nwas saved for the Protestant cause.",
        "Parliament, having undertaken to be something more than\na mere advisory body to the King, made the best of its\nopportunities. The old Petition of Rights of the year 1628 was\nfished out of a forgotten nook of the archives. A second and\nmore drastic Bill of Rights demanded that the sovereign of\nEngland should belong to the Anglican church. Furthermore\nit stated that the king had no right to suspend the laws or\npermit certain privileged citizens to disobey certain laws. It\nstipulated that “without consent of Parliament no taxes could\nbe levied and no army could be maintained.” Thus in the year\n1689 did England acquire an amount of liberty unknown in\nany other country of Europe.",
        "But it is not only on account of this great liberal measure\nthat the rule of William in England is still remembered. During\nhis lifetime, government by a “responsible” ministry first\ndeveloped. No king of course can rule alone. He needs a few\ntrusted advisors. The Tudors had their Great Council which\nwas composed of Nobles and Clergy. This body grew too\nlarge. It was restricted to the small “Privy Council.” In the\ncourse of time it became the custom of these councillors to meet\nthe king in a cabinet in the palace. Hence they were called\nthe “Cabinet Council.” After a short while they were known\nas the “Cabinet.”",
        "William, like most English sovereigns before him, had\nchosen his advisors from among all parties. But with the increased\nstrength of Parliament, he had found it impossible to\ndirect the politics of the country with the help of the Tories\nwhile the Whigs had a majority in the house of Commons.\nTherefore the Tories had been dismissed and the Cabinet Council\nhad been composed entirely of Whigs. A few years later\nwhen the Whigs lost their power in the House of Commons, the\nking, for the sake of convenience, was obliged to look for his\nsupport among the leading Tories. Until his death in 1702,\nWilliam was too busy fighting Louis of France to bother much\nabout the government of England. Practically all important\naffairs had been left to his Cabinet Council. When William’s\nsister-in-law, Anne, succeeded him in 1702 this condition of\naffairs continued. When she died in 1714 (and unfortunately\nnot a single one of her seventeen children survived her) the\nthrone went to George I of the House of Hanover, the son of\nSophie, grand-daughter of James I.",
        "This somewhat rustic monarch, who never learned a word\nof English, was entirely lost in the complicated mazes of England’s\npolitical arrangements. He left everything to his Cabinet\nCouncil and kept away from their meetings, which bored\nhim as he did not understand a single sentence. In this way\nthe Cabinet got into the habit of ruling England and Scotland\n(whose Parliament had been joined to that of England\nin 1707) without bothering the King, who was apt to spend\na great deal of his time on the continent.",
        "During the reign of George I and George II, a succession of\ngreat Whigs (of whom one, Sir Robert Walpole, held office for\ntwenty-one years) formed the Cabinet Council of the King.\nTheir leader was finally recognised as the official leader not\nonly of the actual Cabinet but also of the majority party in\npower in Parliament. The attempts of George III to take\nmatters into his own hands and not to leave the actual business\nof government to his Cabinet were so disastrous that\nthey were never repeated. And from the earliest years of the\neighteenth century on, England enjoyed representative government,\nwith a responsible ministry which conducted the affairs\nof the land.",
        "To be quite true, this government did not represent all\nclasses of society. Less than one man in a dozen had the right\nto vote. But it was the foundation for the modern representative\nform of government. In a quiet and orderly fashion it\ntook the power away from the King and placed it in the hands\nof an ever increasing number of popular representatives. It did\nnot bring the millenium to England, but it saved that country\nfrom most of the revolutionary outbreaks which proved so\ndisastrous to the European continent in the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries.",
        "IN FRANCE ON THE OTHER HAND THE “DIVINE\nRIGHT OF KINGS” CONTINUED WITH\nGREATER POMP AND SPLENDOUR THAN\nEVER BEFORE AND THE AMBITION OF\nTHE RULER WAS ONLY TEMPERED BY\nTHE NEWLY INVENTED LAW OF THE\n\"BALANCE OF POWER”",
        "As a contrast to the previous chapter, let me tell you what\nhappened in France during the years when the English people\nwere fighting for their liberty. The happy combination\nof the right man in the right country at the right moment is very\nrare in History. Louis XIV was a realisation of this ideal, as\nfar as France was concerned, but the rest of Europe would\nhave been happier without him.",
        "The country over which the young king was called to rule\nwas the most populous and the most brilliant nation of that\nday. Louis came to the throne when Mazarin and Richelieu,\nthe two great Cardinals, had just hammered the ancient French\nKingdom into the most strongly centralised state of the seventeenth\ncentury. He was himself a man of extraordinary ability.\nWe, the people of the twentieth century, are still\nsurrounded by the memories of the glorious age of the Sun King.\nOur social life is based upon the perfection of manners and the\nelegance of expression attained at the court of Louis. In\ninternational and diplomatic relations, French is still the official\nlanguage of diplomacy and international gatherings because\ntwo centuries ago it reached a polished elegance and a purity\nof expression which no other tongue had as yet been able to\nequal. The theatre of King Louis still teaches us lessons\nwhich we are only too slow in learning. During his reign the\nFrench Academy (an invention of Richelieu) came to occupy\na position in the world of letters which other countries have\nflattered by their imitation. We might continue this list for\nmany pages. It is no matter of mere chance that our modern\nbill-of-fare is printed in French. The very difficult art of\ndecent cooking, one of the highest expressions of civilisation,\nwas first practiced for the benefit of the great Monarch. The\nage of Louis XIV was a time of splendour and grace which can\nstill teach us a lot.",
        "Unfortunately this brilliant picture has another side which\nwas far less encouraging. Glory abroad too often means\nmisery at home, and France was no exception to this rule\nLouis XIV succeeded his father in the year 1643. He died in\nthe year 1715. That means that the government of France\nwas in the hands of one single man for seventy-two years,\nalmost two whole generations.",
        "It will be well to get a firm grasp of this idea, “one single\nman.” Louis was the first of a long list of monarchs who in\nmany countries established that particular form of highly efficient\nautocracy which we call “enlightened despotism.” He\ndid not like kings who merely played at being rulers and\nturned official affairs into a pleasant picnic. The Kings of\nthat enlightened age worked harder than any of their subjects.\nThey got up earlier and went to bed later than anybody else,\nand felt their “divine responsibility” quite as strongly as their\n\"divine right” which allowed them to rule without consulting\ntheir subjects.",
        "Of course, the king could not attend to everything in person.\nHe was obliged to surround himself with a few helpers\nand councillors. One or two generals, some experts upon foreign\npolitics, a few clever financiers and economists would do\nfor this purpose. But these dignitaries could act only through\ntheir Sovereign. They had no individual existence. To the\nmass of the people, the Sovereign actually represented in his\nown sacred person the government of their country. The\nglory of the common fatherland became the glory of a single\ndynasty. It meant the exact opposite of our own American\nideal. France was ruled of and by and for the House of Bourbon.",
        "The disadvantages of such a system are clear. The King\ngrew to be everything. Everybody else grew to be nothing at\nall. The old and useful nobility was gradually forced to give\nup its former shares in the government of the provinces. A little\nRoyal bureaucrat, his fingers splashed with ink, sitting behind\nthe greenish windows of a government building in faraway\nParis, now performed the task which a hundred years\nbefore had been the duty of the feudal Lord. The feudal Lord,\ndeprived of all work, moved to Paris to amuse himself as best\nhe could at the court. Soon his estates began to suffer from\nthat very dangerous economic sickness, known as “Absentee\nLandlordism.” Within a single generation, the industrious\nand useful feudal administrators had become the well-mannered\nbut quite useless loafers of the court of Versailles.",
        "Louis was ten years old when the peace of Westphalia was\nconcluded and the House of Habsburg, as a result of the\nThirty Years War, lost its predominant position in Europe.\nIt was inevitable that a man with his ambition should use so\nfavourable a moment to gain for his own dynasty the honours\nwhich had formerly been held by the Habsburgs. In the year\n1660 Louis had married Maria Theresa, daughter of the King\nof Spain. Soon afterward, his father-in-law, Philip IV, one\nof the half-witted Spanish Habsburgs, died. At once Louis\nclaimed the Spanish Netherlands (Belgium) as part of his\nwife’s dowry. Such an acquisition would have been disastrous\nto the peace of Europe, and would have threatened the safety\nof the Protestant states. Under the leadership of Jan de Witt,\nRaadpensionaris or Foreign Minister of the United Seven\nNetherlands, the first great international alliance, the Triple\nAlliance of Sweden, England and Holland, of the year 1661,\nwas concluded. It did not last long. With money and fair\npromises Louis bought up both King Charles and the Swedish\nEstates. Holland was betrayed by her allies and was left to\nher own fate. In the year 1672 the French invaded the low\ncountries. They marched to the heart of the country. For a\nsecond time the dikes were opened and the Royal Sun of\nFrance set amidst the mud of the Dutch marshes. The peace\nof Nimwegen which was concluded in 1678 settled nothing but\nmerely anticipated another war.",
        "A second war of aggression from 1689 to 1697, ending with\nthe Peace of Ryswick, also failed to give Louis that position in\nthe affairs of Europe to which he aspired. His old enemy,\nJan de Witt, had been murdered by the Dutch rabble, but his\nsuccessor, William III (whom you met in the last chapter),\nhad checkmated all efforts of Louis to make France the ruler of\nEurope.",
        "The great war for the Spanish succession, begun in the\nyear 1701, immediately after the death of Charles II, the last\nof the Spanish Habsburgs, and ended in 1713 by the Peace\nof Utrecht, remained equally undecided, but it had ruined the\ntreasury of Louis. On land the French king had been victorious,\nbut the navies of England and Holland had spoiled all\nhope for an ultimate French victory; besides the long struggle\nhad given birth to a new and fundamental principle of international\npolitics, which thereafter made it impossible for one\nsingle nation to rule the whole of Europe or the whole of the\nworld for any length of time.",
        "That was the so-called “balance of power.” It was not a\nwritten law but for three centuries it has been obeyed as closely\nas are the laws of nature. The people who originated the idea\nmaintained that Europe, in its nationalistic stage of development,\ncould only survive when there should be an absolute balance\nof the many conflicting interests of the entire continent.\nNo single power or single dynasty must ever be allowed to\ndominate the others. During the Thirty Years War, the\nHabsburgs had been the victims of the application of this law.\nThey, however, had been unconscious victims. The issues during\nthat struggle were so clouded in a haze of religious strife\nthat we do not get a very clear view of the main tendencies\nof that great conflict. But from that time on, we begin to see\nhow cold, economic considerations and calculations prevail in\nall matters of international importance. We discover the\ndevelopment of a new type of statesman, the statesman with the\npersonal feelings of the slide-rule and the cash-register. Jan\nde Witt was the first successful exponent of this new school\nof politics. William III was the first great pupil. And Louis\nXIV with all his fame and glory, was the first conscious victim.\nThere have been many others since.",

        "IN the year 1492, as you know, Columbus discovered America.\nEarly in the year, a Tyrolese by the name of Schnups,\ntravelling as the head of a scientific expedition for the\nArchbishop of Tyrol, and provided with the best letters\nof introduction and excellent credit tried to reach the mythical\ntown of Moscow. He did not succeed. When he reached the\nfrontiers of this vast Moscovite state which was vaguely supposed\nto exist in the extreme Eastern part of Europe, he was\nfirmly turned back. No foreigners were wanted. And\nSchnups went to visit the heathen Turk in Constantinople, in\norder that he might have something to report to his clerical\nmaster when he came back from his explorations.",
        "Sixty-one years later, Richard Chancellor, trying to discover\nthe North-eastern passage to the Indies, and blown by\nan ill wind into the White Sea, reached the mouth of the Dwina\nand found the Moscovite village of Kholmogory, a few hours\nfrom the spot where in 1584 the town of Archangel was founded.\nThis time the foreign visitors were requested to come\nto Moscow and show themselves to the Grand Duke. They\nwent and returned to England with the first commercial treaty\never concluded between Russia and the western world. Other\nnations soon followed and something became known of this\nmysterious land.",

        "While the Roman Empire was founded, grew in power and\ndisappeared again, Slavic tribes, who had long since left their\nhomes in Central Asia, wandered aimlessly through the forests\nand plains of the region between the Dniester and Dnieper\nrivers. The Greeks had sometimes met these Slavs and a few\ntravellers of the third and fourth centuries mention them.\nOtherwise they were as little known as were the Nevada Indians\nin the year 1800.",
        "Unfortunately for the peace of these primitive peoples, a\nvery convenient trade-route ran through their country. This\nwas the main road from northern Europe to Constantinople.\nIt followed the coast of the Baltic until the Neva was reached.\nThen it crossed Lake Ladoga and went southward along the\nVolkhov river. Then through Lake Ilmen and up the small\nLovat river. Then there was a short portage until the Dnieper\nwas reached. Then down the Dnieper into the Black Sea.",
        "The Norsemen knew of this road at a very early date. In\nthe ninth century they began to settle in northern Russia, just\nas other Norsemen were laying the foundation for independent\nstates in Germany and France. But in the year 862, three\nNorsemen, brothers, crossed the Baltic and founded three small\ndynasties. Of the three brothers, only one, Rurik, lived for a\nnumber of years. He took possession of the territory of his\nbrothers, and twenty years after the arrival of this first\nNorseman, a Slavic state had been established with Kiev as its\ncapital.",
        "From Kiev to the Black Sea is a short distance. Soon the\nexistence of an organised Slavic State became known in\nConstantinople. This meant a new field for the zealous\nmissionaries of the Christian faith. Byzantine monks followed the\nDnieper on their way northward and soon reached the heart of\nRussia. They found the people worshipping strange gods\nwho were supposed to dwell in woods and rivers and in mountain\ncaves. They taught them the story of Jesus. There was\nno competition from the side of Roman missionaries. These\ngood men were too busy educating the heathen Teutons to\nbother about the distant Slavs. Hence Russia received its religion\nand its alphabet and its first ideas of art and architecture\nfrom the Byzantine monks and as the Byzantine empire (a\nrelic of the eastern Roman empire) had become very oriental\nand had lost many of its European traits, the Russians suffered\nin consequence.",
        "Politically speaking these new states of the great Russian\nplains did not fare well. It was the Norse habit to divide\nevery inheritance equally among all the sons. No sooner had\na small state been founded but it was broken up among eight\nor nine heirs who in turn left their territory to an ever increasing\nnumber of descendants. It was inevitable that these small\ncompeting states should quarrel among themselves. Anarchy\nwas the order of the day. And when the red glow of the eastern\nhorizon told the people of the threatened invasion of a savage\nAsiatic tribe, the little states were too weak and too divided\nto render any sort of defence against this terrible enemy.",
        "It was in the year 1224 that the first great Tartar invasion\ntook place and that the hordes of Jenghiz Khan, the conqueror\nof China, Bokhara, Tashkent and Turkestan made their first\nappearance in the west. The Slavic armies were beaten near\nthe Kalka river and Russia was at the mercy of the Mongolians.\nJust as suddenly as they had come they disappeared.\nThirteen years later, in 1237, however, they returned. In less\nthan five years they conquered every part of the vast Russian\nplains. Until the year 1380 when Dmitry Donskoi, Grand\nDuke of Moscow, beat them on the plains of Kulikovo, the\nTartars were the masters of the Russian people.",
        "All in all, it took the Russians two centuries to deliver\nthemselves from this yoke. For a yoke it was and a most\noffensive and objectionable one. It turned the Slavic peasants\ninto miserable slaves. No Russian could hope to survive un-\nless he was willing to creep before a dirty little yellow man who\nsat in a tent somewhere in the heart of the steppes of southern\nRussia and spat at him. It deprived the mass of the people of\nall feeling of honour and independence. It made hunger and\nmisery and maltreatment and personal abuse the normal state\nof human existence. Until at last the average Russian, were he\npeasant or nobleman, went about his business like a neglected\ndog who has been beaten so often that his spirit has been broken\nand he dare not wag his tail without permission.",
        "There was no escape. The horsemen of the Tartar Khan\nwere fast and merciless. The endless prairie did not give a\nman a chance to cross into the safe territory of his neighbour.\nHe must keep quiet and bear what his yellow master decided\nto inflict upon him or run the risk of death. Of course, Europe\nmight have interfered. But Europe was engaged upon business\nof its own, fighting the quarrels between the Pope and\nthe emperor or suppressing this or that or the other heresy.\nAnd so Europe left the Slav to his fate, and forced him to\nwork out his own salvation.",
        "The final saviour of Russia was one of the many small states,\nfounded by the early Norse rulers. It was situated in the heart\nof the Russian plain. Its capital, Moscow, was upon a steep\nhill on the banks of the Moskwa river. This little principality,\nby dint of pleasing the Tartar (when it was necessary to\nplease), and opposing him (when it was safe to do so), had,\nduring the middle of the fourteenth century made itself the\nleader of a new national life. It must be remembered that the\nTartars were wholly deficient in constructive political ability.\nThey could only destroy. Their chief aim in conquering new\nterritories was to obtain revenue. To get this revenue in the\nform of taxes, it was necessary to allow certain remnants of\nthe old political organization to continue. Hence there were\nmany little towns, surviving by the grace of the Great Khan,\nthat they might act as tax-gatherers and rob their neighbours\nfor the benefit of the Tartar treasury.",
        "The state of Moscow, growing fat at the expense of the\nsurrounding territory, finally became strong enough to risk\nopen rebellion against its masters, the Tartars. It was successful\nand its fame as the leader in the cause of Russian independence\nmade Moscow the natural centre for all those who\nstill believed in a better future for the Slavic race. In the year\n1458, Constantinople was taken by the Turks. Ten years\nlater, under the rule of Ivan III, Moscow informed the\nwestern world that the Slavic state laid claim to the worldly\nand spiritual inheritance of the lost Byzantine Empire, and\nsuch traditions of the Roman empire as had survived in\nConstantinople. A generation afterwards, under Ivan the Terrible,\nthe grand dukes of Moscow were strong enough to adopt the\ntitle of Caesar, or Tsar, and to demand recognition by the western\npowers of Europe.",
        "In the year 1598, with Feodor the First, the old Muscovite\ndynasty, descendants of the original Norseman Rurik, came to\nan end. For the next seven years, a Tartar half-breed, by the\nname of Boris Godunow, reigned as Tsar. It was during\nthis period that the future destiny of the large masses of the\nRussian people was decided. This Empire was rich in land\nbut very poor in money. There was no trade and there were\nno factories. Its few cities were dirty villages. It was composed\nof a strong central government and a vast number of\nilliterate peasants. This government, a mixture of Slavic,\nNorse, Byzantine and Tartar influences, recognised nothing\nbeyond the interest of the state. To defend this state, it\nneeded an army. To gather the taxes, which were necessary\nto pay the soldiers, it needed civil servants. To pay these many\nofficials it needed land. In the vast wilderness on the east\nand west there was a sufficient supply of this commodity. But\nland without a few labourers to till the fields and tend the\ncattle, has no value. Therefore the old nomadic peasants\nwere robbed of one privilege after the other, until finally, during\nthe first year of the sixteenth century, they were formally\nmade a part of the soil upon which they lived. The Russian\npeasants ceased to be free men. They became serfs or slaves\nand they remained serfs until the year 1861, when their fate\nhad become so terrible that they were beginning to die out.",
        "In the seventeenth century, this new state with its growing\nterritory which was spreading quickly into Siberia, had become\na force with which the rest of Europe was obliged to\nreckon. In 1618, after the death of Boris Godunow, the\nRussian nobles had elected one of their own number to be\nTsar. He was Michael, the son of Feodor, of the Moscow family\nof Romanow who lived in a little house just outside the\nKremlin.",
        "In the year 1672 his great-grandson, Peter, the son of another\nFeodor, was born. When the child was ten years old,\nhis step-sister Sophia took possession of the Russian throne.\nThe little boy was allowed to spend his days in the suburbs of\nthe national capital, where the foreigners lived. Surrounded\nby Scotch barkeepers, Dutch traders, Swiss apothecaries, Italian\nbarbers, French dancing teachers and German school-masters,\nthe young prince obtained a first but rather extraordinary\nimpression of that far-away and mysterious Europe where\nthings were done differently.",
        "When he was seventeen years old, he suddenly pushed\nSister Sophia from the throne. Peter himself became the ruler\nof Russia. He was not contented with being the Tsar of a\nsemi-barbarous and half-Asiatic people. He must be the sovereign\nhead of a civilised nation. To change Russia overnight\nfrom a Byzantine-Tartar state into a European empire was no\nsmall undertaking. It needed strong hands and a capable\nhead. Peter possessed both. In the year 1698, the great\noperation of grafting Modern Europe upon Ancient Russia was\nperformed. The patient did not die. But he never got over\nthe shock, as the events of the last five years have shown very\nplainly.",
        "RUSSIA AND SWEDEN FIGHT MANY WARS TO\nDECIDE WHO SHALL BE THE LEADING\nPOWER OF NORTH-EASTERN EUROPE",
        "IN the year 1698, Tsar Peter set forth upon his first\nvoyage to western Europe. He travelled by way of Berlin and\nwent to Holland and to England. As a child he had almost\nbeen drowned sailing a homemade boat in the duck pond of\nhis father’s country home. This passion for water remained\nwith him to the end of his life. In a practical way it showed\nitself in his wish to give his land-locked domains access to\nthe open sea.",
        "While the unpopular and harsh young ruler was away\nfrom home, the friends of the old Russian ways in Moscow set\nto work to undo all his reforms. A sudden rebellion among\nhis life-guards, the Streltsi regiment, forced Peter to hasten\nhome by the fast mail. He appointed himself executioner-in-\nchief and the Streltsi were hanged and quartered and killed to\nthe last man. Sister Sophia, who had been the head of the\nrebellion, was locked up in a cloister and the rule of Peter be-\ngan in earnest. This scene was repeated in the year 1716 when\nPeter had gone on his second western trip. That time the\nreactionaries followed the leadership of Peter’s half-witted\nson, Alexis. Again the Tsar returned in great haste. Alexis\nwas beaten to death in his prison cell and the friends of the\nold fashioned Byzantine ways marched thousands of dreary\nmiles to their final destination in the Siberian lead mines.\nAfter that, no further outbreaks of popular discontent took\nplace. Until the time of his death, Peter could reform in peace.",
        "It is not easy to give you a list of his reforms in chronological\norder. The Tsar worked with furious haste. He followed\nno system. He issued his decrees with such rapidity that it is\ndifficult to keep count. Peter seemed to feel that everything\nthat had ever happened before was entirely wrong. The whole\nof Russia therefore must be changed within the shortest possible\ntime. When he died he left behind a well-trained army of\n200,000 men and a navy of fifty ships. The old system of government\nhad been abolished over night. The Duma, or convention\nof Nobles, had been dismissed and in its stead, the Tsar\nhad surrounded himself with an advisory board of state officials,\ncalled the Senate.",
        "Russia was divided into eight large “governments” or provinces.\nRoads were constructed. Towns were built. Industries\nwere created wherever it pleased the Tsar, without any regard\nfor the presence of raw material. Canals were dug and mines\nwere opened in the mountains of the east. In this land of illiterates,\nschools were founded and establishments of higher learning,\ntogether with Universities and hospitals and professional\nschools. Dutch naval engineers and tradesmen and artisans\nfrom all over the world were encouraged to move to Russia.\nPrinting shops were established, but all books must be first read\nby the imperial censors. The duties of each class of society\nwere carefully written down in a new law and the entire system\nof civil and criminal laws was gathered into a series of printed\nvolumes. The old Russian costumes were abolished by Imperial\ndecree, and policemen, armed with scissors, watching\nall the country roads, changed the long-haired Russian mou-\njiks suddenly into a pleasing imitation of smooth-shaven west.\nEuropeans.",
        "In religious matters, the Tsar tolerated no division of\npower. There must be no chance of a rivalry between an\nEmperor and a Pope as had happened in Europe. In the year\n1721, Peter made himself head of the Russian Church. The\nPatriarchate of Moscow was abolished and the Holy Synod\nmade its appearance as the highest source of authority in all\nmatters of the Established Church.",
        "Since, however, these many reforms could not be success-\nful while the old Russian elements had a rallying point in the\ntown of Moscow, Peter decided to move his government to a\nnew capital. Amidst the unhealthy marshes of the Baltic Sea\nthe Tsar built this new city. He began to reclaim the land in\nthe year 1703. Forty thousand peasants worked for years\nto lay the foundations for this Imperial city. The Swedes\nattacked Peter and tried to destroy his town and illness and\nmisery killed tens of thousands of the peasants. But the work\nwas continued, winter and summer, and the ready-made town\nsoon began to grow. In the year 1712, it was officially de-\nclared to be the “Imperial Residence.” A dozen years later\nit had 75,000 inhabitants. Twice a year the whole city was\nflooded by the Neva. But the terrific will-power of the Tsar\ncreated dykes and canals and the floods ceased to do harm.\nWhen Peter died in 1725 he was the owner of the largest city\nin northern Europe.",
        "Of course, this sudden growth of so dangerous a rival had\nbeen a source of great worry to all the neighbours. From his\nside, Peter had watched with interest the many adventures of\nhis Baltic rival, the kingdom of Sweden. In the year 1654,\nChristina, the only daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, the hero\nof the Thirty Years War, had renounced the throne and had\ngone to Rome to end her days as a devout Catholic. A Protestant\nnephew of Gustavus Adolphus had succeeded the last\nQueen of the House of Vasa. Under Charles X and Charles\nXI, the new dynasty had brought Sweden to its highest point\nof development. But in 1697, Charles XI died suddenly and\nwas succeeded by a boy of fifteen, Charles XII.",
        "This was the moment for which many of the northern states\nhad waited. During the great religious wars of the seventeenth\ncentury, Sweden had grown at the expense of her neighbours.\nThe time had come, so the owners thought, to balance the account.\nAt once war broke out between Russia, Poland, Denmark\nand Saxony on the one side, and Sweden on the other.\nThe raw and untrained armies of Peter were disastrously beaten\nby Charles in the famous battle of Narva in November of\nthe year 1700. Then Charles, one of the most interesting military\ngeniuses of that century, turned against his other enemies\nand for nine years he hacked and burned his way through the\nvillages and cities of Poland, Saxony, Denmark and the Baltic\nprovinces, while Peter drilled and trained his soldiers in distant\nRussia.",
        "As a result, in the year 1709, in the battle of Poltawa, the\nMoscovites destroyed the exhausted armies of Sweden. Charles\ncontinued to be a highly picturesque figure, a wonderful hero\nof romance, but in his vain attempt to have his revenge, he\nruined his own country. In the year 1718, he was accidentally\nkilled or assassinated (we do not know which) and when peace\nwas made in 1721, in the town of Nystadt, Sweden had lost all\nof her former Baltic possessions except Finland. The new\nRussian state, created by Peter, had become the leading power\nof northern Europe. But already a new rival was on the\nway. The Prussian state was taking shape.",
        "THE EXTRAORDINARY RISE OF A LITTLE\nSTATE IN A DREARY PART OF NORTHERN\nGERMANY, CALLED PRUSSIA",
        "THE history of Prussia is the history of a frontier district.\nIn the ninth century, Charlemagne had transferred the old\ncentre of civilisation from the Mediterranean to the wild regions\nof northwestern Europe. His Frankish soldiers had pushed\nthe frontier of Europe further and further towards the east.\nThey had conquered many lands from the heathenish Slavs and\nLithuanians who were living in the plain between the Baltic\nSea and the Carpathian Mountains, and the Franks administered\nthose outlying districts just as the United States used\nto administer her territories before they achieved the dignity\nof statehood.",
        "The frontier state of Brandenburg had been originally\nfounded by Charlemagne to defend his eastern possessions\nagainst raids of the wild Saxon tribes. The Wends, a Slavic\ntribe which inhabited that region, were subjugated during the\ntenth century and their market-place, by the name of Brennabor,\nbecame the centre of and gave its name to the new province\nof Brandenburg.",
        "During the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth\ncenturies, a succession of noble families exercised the functions of\nimperial governor in this frontier state. Finally in the\nfifteenth century, the House of Hohenzollern made its appear-\nance, and as Electors of Brandenburg, commenced to change a\nsandy and forlorn frontier territory into one of the most efficient\nempires of the modern world.",
        "These Hohenzollerns, who have just been removed from\nthe historical stage by the combined forces of Europe and\nAmerica, came originally from southern Germany. They were\nof very humble origin. In the twelfth century a certain Frederick\nof Hohenzollern had made a lucky marriage and had been\nappointed keeper of the castle of Nuremberg. His descendants\nhad used every chance and every opportunity to improve their\npower and after several centuries of watchful grabbing, they\nhad been appointed to the dignity of Elector, the name given to\nthose sovereign princes who were supposed to elect the Emperors\nof the old German Empire. During the Reformation,\nthey had taken the side of the Protestants and the early\nseventeenth century found them among the most powerful of the\nnorth German princes.",
        "During the Thirty Years War, both Protestants and\nCatholics had plundered Brandenburg and Prussia with equal\nzeal. But under Frederick William, the Great Elector, the\ndamage was quickly repaired and by a wise and careful use of\nall the economic and intellectual forces of the country, a state\nwas founded in which there was practically no waste.",
        "Modern Prussia, a state in which the individual and his\nwishes and aspirations have been entirely absorbed by the\ninterests of the community as a whole this Prussia dates back\nto the father of Frederick the Great. Frederick William I was\na hard working, parsimonious Prussian sergeant, with a great\nlove for bar-room stories and strong Dutch tobacco, an intense\ndislike of all frills and feathers, (especially if they were of\nFrench origin,) and possessed of but one idea. That idea was\nDuty. Severe with himself, he tolerated no weakness in his\nsubjects, whether they be generals or common soldiers. The\nrelation between himself and his son Frederick was never cordial,\nto say the least. The boorish manners of the father offended\nthe finer spirit of the son. The son’s love for French\nmanners, literature, philosophy and music was rejected by the\nfather as a manifestation of sissy-ness. There followed a terrible\noutbreak between these two strange temperaments. Frederick\ntried to escape to England. He was caught and court-\nmartialed and forced to witness the decapitation of his best\nfriend who had tried to help him. Thereupon as part of his\npunishment, the young prince was sent to a little fortress\nsomewhere in the provinces to be taught the details of his future\nbusiness of being a king. It proved a blessing in disguise.\nWhen Frederick came to the throne in 1740, he knew how his\ncountry was managed from the birth certificate of a pauper’s\nson to the minutest detail of a complicated annual Budget.",
        "As an author, especially in his book called the “Anti-\nMacchiavelli,” Frederick had expressed his contempt for the\npolitical creed of the ancient Florentine historian, who had\nadvised his princely pupils to lie and cheat whenever it was\nnecessary to do so for the benefit of their country. The ideal\nruler in Frederick’s volume was the first servant of his people,\nthe enlightened despot after the example of Louis XIV. In\npractice, however, Frederick, while working for his people\ntwenty hours a day, tolerated no one to be near him as a\ncounsellor. His ministers were superior clerks. Prussia was his\nprivate possession, to be treated according to his own wishes.\nAnd nothing was allowed to interfere with the interest of the\nstate.",
        "In the year 1740 the Emperor Charles VI, of Austria,\ndied. He had tried to make the position of his only daughter,\nMaria Theresa, secure through a solemn treaty, written black\non white, upon a large piece of parchment. But no sooner had\nthe old emperor been deposited in the ancestral crypt of the\nHabsburg family, than the armies of Frederick were marching\ntowards the Austrian frontier to occupy that part of Silesia for\nwhich (together with almost everything else in central Europe)\nPrussia clamored, on account of some ancient and very\ndoubtful rights of claim. In a number of wars, Frederick\nconquered all of Silesia, and although he was often very near\ndefeat, he maintained himself in his newly acquired territories\nagainst all Austrian counter-attacks.",
        "Europe took due notice of this sudden appearance of a\nvery powerful new state. In the eighteenth century, the Germans\nwere a people who had been ruined by the great religious\nwars and who were not held in high esteem by any one. Frederick,\nby an effort as sudden and quite as terrific as that of\nPeter of Russia, changed this attitude of contempt into one\nof fear. The internal affairs of Prussia were arranged so\nskillfully that the subjects had less reason for complaint than\nelsewhere. The treasury showed an annual surplus instead of a\ndeficit. Torture was abolished. The judiciary system was\nimproved. Good roads and good schools and good universities,\ntogether with a scrupulously honest administration, made the\npeople feel that whatever services were demanded of them,\nthey (to speak the vernacular) got their money’s worth.",
        "After having been for several centuries the battle field of\nthe French and the Austrians and the Swedes and the Danes\nand the Poles, Germany, encouraged by the example of Prussia,\nbegan to regain self-confidence. And this was the work of\nthe little old man, with his hook-nose and his old uniforms covered\nwith snuff, who said very funny but very unpleasant things\nabout his neighbours, and who played the scandalous game of\neighteenth century diplomacy without any regard for the truth,\nprovided he could gain something by his lies. This in spite of\nhis book, “Anti-Macchiavelli.” In the year 1786 the end\ncame. His friends were all gone. Children he had never had.\nHe died alone, tended by a single servant and his faithful\ndogs, whom he loved better than human beings because, as he\nsaid, they were never ungrateful and remained true to their\nfriends.",
        "HOW THE NEWLY FOUNDED NATIONAL OR\nDYNASTIC STATES OF EUROPE TRIED TO\nMAKE THEMSELVES RICH AND WHAT WAS\nMEANT BY THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM",
        "WE have seen how, during the sixteenth and the seventeenth\ncenturies, the states of our modern world began to take shape.\nTheir origins were different in almost every case. Some had\nbeen the result of the deliberate effort of a single king. Others\nhad happened by chance. Still others had been the result of\nfavourable natural geographic boundaries. But once they had\nbeen founded, they had all of them tried to strengthen their\ninternal administration and to exert the greatest possible influence\nupon foreign affairs. All this of course had cost a great\ndeal of money. The mediaeval state with its lack of centralised\npower did not depend upon a rich treasury. The king got his\nrevenues from the crown domains and his civil service paid for\nitself. The modern centralised state was a more complicated\naffair. The old knights disappeared and hired government\nofficials or bureaucrats took their place. Army, navy, and\ninternal administration demanded millions. The question then\nbecame where was this money to be found?",
        "Gold and silver had been a rare commodity in the middle\nages. The average man, as I have told you, never saw a gold\npiece as long as he lived. Only the inhabitants of the large\ncities were familiar with silver coin. The discovery of America\nand the exploitation of the Peruvian mines changed all this.\nThe centre of trade was transferred from the Mediterranean to\nthe Atlantic seaboard. The old “commercial cities” of Italy lost\ntheir financial importance. New “commercial nations” took\ntheir place and gold and silver were no longer a curiosity.",
        "Through Spain and Portugal and Holland and England,\nprecious metals began to find their way to Europe The sixteenth\ncentury had its own writers on the subject of political\neconomy and they evolved a theory of national wealth which\nseemed to them entirely sound and of the greatest possible\nbenefit to their respective countries. They reasoned that both\ngold and silver were actual wealth. Therefore they believed\nthat the country with the largest supply of actual cash in the\nvaults of its treasury and its banks was at the same time the\nrichest country. And since money meant armies, it followed\nthat the richest country was also the most powerful and could\nrule the rest of the world.",
        "We call this system the “mercantile system,” and it was\naccepted with the same unquestioning faith with which the\nearly Christians believed in Miracles and many of the present-\nday American business men believe in the Tariff. In practice,\nthe Mercantile system worked out as follows: To get the\nlargest surplus of precious metals a country must have a\nfavourable balance of export trade. If you can export more to\nyour neighbour than he exports to your own country, he will\nowe you money and will be obliged to send you some of his\ngold. Hence you gain and he loses. As a result of this creed,\nthe economic program of almost every seventeenth century\nstate was as follows:",
        "Try to get possession of as many precious metals as you can.",
        "Encourage foreign trade in preference to domestic trade.",
        "Encourage those industries which change raw materials into exportable finished products.",
        "Encourage a large population, for you will need workmen for your factories and an agricultural community does not raise enough workmen.",
        "Let the State watch this process and interfere whenever it is necessary to do so.",
        "Instead of regarding International Trade as something\nakin to a force of nature which would always obey certain natural\nlaws regardless of man’s interference, the people of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries tried to regulate their\ncommerce by the help of official decrees and royal laws and financial\nhelp on the part of the government.",
        "In the sixteenth century Charles V adopted this Mercantile\nSystem (which was then something entirely new) and introduced\nit into his many possessions. Elizabeth of England\nflattered him by her imitation. The Bourbons, especially King\nLouis XIV, were fanatical adherents of this doctrine and Colbert,\nhis great minister of finance, became the prophet of Mercantilism\nto whom all Europe looked for guidance.",
        "The entire foreign policy of Cromwell was a practical\napplication of the Mercantile System. It was invariably directed\nagainst the rich rival Republic of Holland. For the Dutch\nshippers, as the common-carriers of the merchandise of Europe,\nhad certain leanings towards free-trade and therefore had\nto be destroyed at all cost.",
        "It will be easily understood how such a system must affect\nthe colonies. A colony under the Mercantile System became\nmerely a reservoir of gold and silver and spices, which was\nto be tapped for the benefit of the home country. The Asiatic,\nAmerican and African supply of precious metals and the raw\nmaterials of these tropical countries became a monopoly of\nthe state which happened to own that particular colony. No\noutsider was ever allowed within the precincts and no native\nwas permitted to trade with a merchant whose ship flew a\nforeign flag.",
        "Undoubtedly the Mercantile System encouraged the development\nof young industries in certain countries where there\nnever had been any manufacturing before. It built roads\nand dug canals and made for better means of transportation.\nIt demanded greater skill among the workmen and gave the\nmerchant a better social position, while it weakened the power\nof the landed aristocracy.",
        "On the other hand, it caused very great misery. It made\nthe natives in the colonies the victims of a most shameless\nexploitation. It exposed the citizens of the home country to an\neven more terrible fate. It helped in a great measure to turn\nevery land into an armed camp and divided the world into little\nbits of territory, each working for its own direct benefit,\nwhile striving at all times to destroy the power of its neighbours\nand get hold of their treasures. It laid so much stress\nupon the importance of owning wealth that “being rich” came\nto be regarded as the sole virtue of the average citizen. Economic\nsystems come and go like the fashions in surgery and\nin the clothes of women, and during the nineteenth century the\nMercantile System was discarded in favor of a system of free\nand open competition. At least, so I have been told.",
        "AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\nEUROPE HEARD STRANGE REPORTS OF\nSOMETHING WHICH HAD HAPPENED IN\nTHE WILDERNESS; OF THE NORTH AMERICAN\nCONTINENT. THE DESCENDANTS\nOF THE MEN WHO HAD PUNISHED KING\nCHARLES FOR HIS INSISTENCE UPON HIS\n\"DIVINE RIGHTS” ADDED A NEW CHAPTER\nTO THE OLD STORY OF THE STRUGGLE\nFOR SELF-GOVERNMENT",
        "FOR the sake of convenience, we ought to go back a\nfew centuries and repeat the early history of the great\nstruggle for colonial possessions.",
        "As soon as a number of European nations had been\ncreated upon the new basis of national or dynastic interests,\nthat is to say, during and immediately after the Thirty\nYears War, their rulers, backed up by the capital of\ntheir merchants and the ships of their trading companies,\ncontinued the fight for more territory in Asia, Africa and America.",
        "The Spaniards and the Portuguese had been exploring the\nIndian Sea and the Pacific Ocean for more than a century ere\nHolland and England appeared upon the stage. This proved\nan advantage to the latter. The first rough work had already\nbeen done. What is more, the earliest navigators had so often\nmade themselves unpopular with the Asiatic and American and\nAfrican natives that both the English and the Dutch were\nwelcomed as friends and deliverers. We cannot claim any\nsuperior virtues for either of these two races. But they were\nmerchants before everything else. They never allowed religious\nconsiderations to interfere with their practical common sense.\nDuring their first relations with weaker races, all European\nnations have behaved with shocking brutality. The English and\nthe Dutch, however, knew better where to draw the dine. Provided\nthey got their spices and their gold and silver and their taxes,\nthey were willing to let the native live as it best pleased him.",
        "It was not very difficult for them therefore to establish\nthemselves in the richest parts of the world. But as soon as\nthis had been accomplished, they began to fight each other for\nstill further possessions. Strangely enough, the colonial wars\nwere never settled in the colonies themselves. They were decided\nthree thousand miles away by the navies of the contending\ncountries. It is one of the most interesting principles of ancient\nand modern warfare (one of the few reliable laws of\nhistory) that “the nation which commands the sea is also the\nnation which commands the land.” So far this law has never\nfailed to work, but the modern airplane may have changed it.\nIn the eighteenth century, however, there were no flying machines\nand it was the British navy which gained for England\nher vast American and Indian and African colonies.",
        "The series of naval wars between England and Holland in\nthe seventeenth century does not interest us here. It ended as\nall such encounters between hopelessly ill-matched powers will\nend. But the warfare between England and France (her other\nrival) is of greater importance to us, for while the superior\nBritish fleet in the end defeated the French navy, a great deal\nof the preliminary fighting was done on our own American\ncontinent. In this vast country, both France and England\nclaimed everything which had been discovered and a lot more\nwhich the eye of no white man had ever seen. In 1497 Cabot\nhad landed in the northern part of America and twenty-seven\nyears later, Giovanni Verrazano had visited these coasts. Cabot\nhad flown the English flag. Verrazano had sailed under the\nFrench flag. Hence both England and France proclaimed\nthemselves the owners of the entire continent.",
        "During the seventeenth century, some ten small English\ncolonies had been founded between Maine and the Carolinas.\nThey were usually a haven of refuge for some particular sect\nof English dissenters, such as the Puritans, who in the year\n1620 went to New England, or the Quakers, who settled in\nPennsylvania in 1681. They were small frontier communities,\nnestling close to the shores of the ocean, where people had\ngathered to make a new home and begin life among happier\nsurroundings, far away from royal supervision and interference.",
        "The French colonies, on the other hand, always remained\na possession of the crown. No Huguenots or Protestants were\nallowed in these colonies for fear that they might contaminate\nthe Indians with their dangerous Protestant doctrines and\nwould perhaps interfere with the missionary work of the Jesuit\nfathers. The English colonies, therefore, had been founded\nupon a much healthier basis than their French neighbours and\nrivals. They were an expression of the commercial energy of\nthe English middle classes, while the French settlements were\ninhabited by people who had crossed the ocean as servants of the\nking and who expected to return to Paris at the first possible chance.",
        "Politically, however, the position of the English colonies\nwas far from satisfactory. The French had discovered the\nmouth of the Saint Lawrence in the sixteenth century. From\nthe region of the Great Lakes they had worked their way southward,\nhad descended the Mississippi and had built several fortifications\nalong the Gulf of Mexico. After a century of exploration,\na line of sixty French forts cut off the English settlements\nalong the Atlantic seaboard from the interior.",
        "The English land grants, made to the different colonial\ncompanies had given them “all land from sea to sea.” This\nsounded well on paper, but in practice, British territory\nended where the line of French fortifications began. To break\nthrough this barrier was possible but it took both men and\nmoney and caused a series of horrible border wars in which\nboth sides murdered their white neighbours, with the help of the\nIndian tribes.",
        "As long as the Stuarts had ruled England there had been\nno danger of war with France. The Stuarts needed the Bourbons\nin their attempt to establish an autocratic form of government\nand to break the power of Parliament. But in 1689 the\nlast of the Stuarts had disappeared from British soil and Dutch\nWilliam, the great enemy of Louis XIV succeeded him. From\nthat time on, until the Treaty of Paris of 1763, France and\nEngland fought for the possession of India and North America.",
        "During these wars, as I have said before, the English navies\ninvariably beat the French. Cut off from her colonies, France\nlost most of her possessions, and when peace was declared, the\nentire North American continent had fallen into British hands\nand the great work of exploration of Cartier, Champlain, La\nSalle, Marquette and a score of others was lost to France.",
        "Only a very small part of this vast domain was inhabited.\nFrom Massachusetts in the north, where the Pilgrims (a sect\nof Puritans who were very intolerant and who therefore had\nfound no happiness either in Anglican England or Calvinist\nHolland) had landed in the year 1620, to the Carolinas and\nVirginia (the tobacco-raising provinces which had been founded\nentirely for the sake of profit), stretched a thin line of\nsparsely populated territory. But the men who lived in this\nnew land of fresh air and high skies were very different from\ntheir brethren of the mother country. In the wilderness they\nhad learned independence and self-reliance. They were the\nsons of hardy and energetic ancestors. Lazy and timourous\npeople did not cross the ocean in those days. The American\ncolonists hated the restraint and the lack of breathing space\nwhich had made their lives in the old country so very unhappy.\nThey meant to be their own masters. This the ruling classes\nof England did not seem to understand. The government annoyed\nthe colonists and the colonists, who hated to be bothered\nin this way, began to annoy the British government.",
        "Bad feeling caused more bad feeling. It is not necessary\nto repeat here in detail what actually happened and what might\nhave been avoided if the British king had been more intelligent\nthan George III or less given to drowsiness and indifference\nthan his minister, Lord North. The British colonists,\nwhen they understood that peaceful arguments would not\nsettle the difficulties, took to arms. From being loyal subjects,\nthey turned rebels, who exposed themselves to the punishment\nof death when they were captured by the German\nsoldiers, whom George hired to do his fighting after the pleasant\ncustom of that day, when Teutonic princes sold whole\nregiments to the highest bidder.",
        "The war between England and her American colonies\nlasted seven years. During most of that time, the final success\nof the rebels seemed very doubtful. A great number of\nthe people, especially in the cities, had remained loyal to their\nking. They were in favour of a compromise, and would have\nbeen willing to sue for peace. But the great figure of Washington\nstood guard over the cause of the colonists.",
        "Ably assisted by a handful of brave men, he used his steadfast\nbut badly equipped armies to weaken the forces of the king.\nTime and again when defeat seemed unavoidable, his strategy\nturned the tide of battle. Often his men were ill-fed. During\nthe winter they lacked shoes and coats and were forced to live\nin unhealthy dug-outs. But their trust in their great leader\nwas absolute and they stuck it out until the final hour of victory.",
        "But more interesting than the campaigns of Washington\nor the diplomatic triumphs of Benjamin Franklin who was\nin Europe getting money from the French government and\nthe Amsterdam bankers, was an event which occurred early in\nthe revolution. The representatives of the different colonies\nhad gathered in Philadelphia to discuss matters of common\nimportance. It was the first year of the Revolution. Most\nof the big towns of the sea coast were still in the hands of the\nBritish. Reinforcements from England were arriving by the\nship load. Only men who were deeply convinced of the righteousness\nof their cause would have found the courage to take\nthe momentous decision of the months of June and July of\nthe year 1776.",
        "In June, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia proposed a motion\nto the Continental Congress that “these united colonies\nare, and of right ought to be, free and independent states, that\nthey are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and\nthat all political connection between them and the state of\nGreat Britain is and ought to be, totally dissolved.”",
        "The motion was seconded by John Adams of Massachusetts.\nIt was carried on July the second and on July fourth,\nit was followed by an official Declaration of Independence,\nwhich was the work of Thomas Jefferson, a serious and exceedingly\ncapable student of both politics and government and\ndestined to be one of the most famous of our American presidents.",
        "When news of this event reached Europe, and was followed\nby the final victory of the colonists and the adoption of\nthe famous Constitution of the year 1787 (the first of all written\nconstitutions) it caused great interest. The dynastic system\nof the highly centralised states which had been developed\nafter the great religious wars of the seventeenth century had\nreached the height of its power. Everywhere the palace of\nthe king had grown to enormous proportions, while the cities\nof the royal realm were being surrounded by rapidly growing\nacres of slums. The inhabitants of those slums were showing\nsigns of restlessness. They were quite helpless. But the\nhigher classes, the nobles and the professional men, they too\nwere beginning to have certain doubts about the economic and\npolitical conditions under which they lived. The success of\nthe American colonists showed them that many things were\npossible which had been held impossible only a short time\nbefore.",
        "According to the poet, the shot which opened the battle\nof Lexington was “heard around the world.” That was a bit\nof an exaggeration. The Chinese and the Japanese and the\nRussians (not to speak of the Australians, who had just been\nre-discovered by Captain Cook, whom they killed for his\ntrouble,) never heard of it at all. But it carried across the\nAtlantic Ocean. It landed in the powder house of European\ndiscontent and in France it caused an explosion which rocked\nthe entire continent from Petrograd to Madrid and buried the\nrepresentatives of the old statecraft and the old diplomacy\nunder several tons of democratic bricks.",
        "THE GREAT FRENCH REVOLUTION PROCLAIMS\nTHE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY,\nFRATERNITY AND EQUALITY UNTO ALL\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH",
        "BEFORE we talk about a revolution it is just as well that\nwe explain just what this word means. In the terms of a\ngreat Russian writer (and Russians ought to know what they\nare talking about in this field) a revolution is “a swift overthrow,\nin a few years, of institutions which have taken centuries\nto root in the soil, and seem so fixed and immovable that\neven the most ardent reformers hardly dare to attack them in\ntheir writings. It is the fall, the crumbling away in a brief\nperiod, of all that up to that time has composed the essence\nof social, religious, political and economic life in a nation.”",
        "Such a revolution took place in France in the eighteenth\ncentury when the old civilisation of the country had grown\nstale. The king in the days of Louis XIV had become\nEVERYTHING and was the state. The Nobility, formerly\nthe civil servant of the federal state, found itself without any\nduties and became a social ornament of the royal court.",
        "This French state of the eighteenth century, however, cost\nincredible sums of money. This money had to be produced\nin the form of taxes. Unfortunately the kings of France had\nnot been strong enough to force the nobility and the clergy\nto pay their share of these taxes. Hence the taxes were paid\nentirely by the agricultural population. But the peasants\nliving in dreary hovels, no longer in intimate contact with their\nformer landlords, but victims of cruel and incompetent land\nagents, were going from bad to worse. Why should they\nwork and exert themselves? Increased returns upon their\nland merely meant more taxes and nothing for themselves\nand therefore they neglected their fields as much as they dared.",
        "Hence we have a king who wanders in empty splendour\nthrough the vast halls of his palaces, habitually followed by\nhungry office seekers, all of whom live upon the revenue obtained\nfrom peasants who are no better than the beasts of the\nfields. It is not a pleasant picture, but it is not exaggerated.\nThere was, however, another side to the so-called “Ancien\nRegime” which we must keep in mind.",
        "A wealthy middle class, closely connected with the nobility\n(by the usual process of the rich banker’s daughter marrying\nthe poor baron’s son) and a court composed of all the most\nentertaining people of France, had brought the polite art of\ngraceful living to its highest development. As the best brains\nof the country were not allowed to occupy themselves with\nquestions of political economics, they spent their idle hours\nupon the discussion of abstract ideas.",
        "As fashions in modes of thought and personal behaviour\nare quite as likely to run to extremes as fashion in dress, it\nwas natural that the most artificial society of that day should\ntake a tremendous interest in what they considered “the simple\nlife.” The king and the queen, the absolute and unquestioned\nproprietors of this country galled France, together with all its\ncolonies and dependencies, went to live in funny little country\nhouses all dressed up as milk-maids and stable-boys and played\nat being shepherds in a happy vale of ancient Hellas. Around\nthem, their courtiers danced attendance, their court-musicians\ncomposed lovely minuets, their court barbers devised more\nand more elaborate and costly headgear, until from sheer boredom\nand lack of real jobs, this whole artificial world of Versailles\n(the great show place which Louis XIV had built far\naway from his noisy and restless city) talked of nothing but\nthose subjects which were furthest removed from their own\nlives, just as a man who is starving will talk of nothing except\nfood.",
        "When Voltaire, the courageous old philosopher, playwright,\nhistorian and novelist, and the great enemy of all\nreligious and political tyranny, began to throw his bombs of\ncriticism at everything connected with the Established Order\nof Things, the whole French world applauded him and his\ntheatrical pieces played to standing room only. When Jean\nJacques Rousseau waxed sentimental about primitive man\nand gave his contemporaries delightful descriptions of the\nhappiness of the original inhabitants of this planet, (about\nwhom he knew as little as he did about the children, upon whose\neducation he was the recognised authority,) all France read\nhis “Social Contract” and this society in which the king and\nthe state were one, wept bitter tears when they heard Rousseau’s\nappeal for a return to the blessed days when the real\nsovereignty had lain in the hands of the people and when the\nking had been merely the servant of his people.",
        "When Montesquieu published his “Persian Letters” in\nwhich two distinguished Persian travellers turn the whole existing\nsociety of France topsy-turvy and poke fun at everything\nfrom the king down to the lowest of his six hundred\npastry cooks, the book immediately went through four\neditions and assured the writer thousands of readers for his\nfamous discussion of the “Spirit of the Laws” in which the\nnoble Baron compared the excellent English system with the\nbackward system of France and advocated instead of an absolute\nmonarchy the establishment of a state in which the Executive,\nthe Legislative and the Judicial powers should be in\nseparate hands and should work independently of each other.\nWhen Lebreton, the Parisian book-seller, announced that\nMessieurs Diderot, d’Alembert, Turgot and a score of other\ndistinguished writers were going to publish an Encyclopaedia\nwhich was to contain “all the new ideas and the new science\nand the new knowledge,” the response from the side of the\npublic was most satisfactory, and when after twenty-two years\nthe last of the twenty-eight volumes had been finished, the\nsomewhat belated interference of the police could not repress\nthe enthusiasm with which French society received this most\nimportant but very dangerous contribution to the discussions\nof the day.",
        "Here, let me give you a little warning. When you read a\nnovel about the French revolution or see a play or a movie,\nyou will easily get the impression that the Revolution was the\nwork of the rabble from the Paris slums. It was nothing\nof the kind. The mob appears often upon the “evolutionary\nstage, but invariably at the instigation and under the\nleadership of those middle-class professional men who used the\nhungry multitude as an efficient ally in their warfare upon\nthe king and his court. But the fundamental ideas which\ncaused the revolution were invented by a few brilliant minds,\nand they were at first introduced into the charming drawing-rooms\nof the “Ancien Regime” to provide amiable diversion\nfor the much-bored ladies and gentlemen of his Majesty’s court.\nThese pleasant but careless people played with the dangerous\nfireworks of social criticism until the sparks fell through\nthe cracks of the floor, which was old and rotten just\nlike the rest of the building. Those sparks unfortunately\nlanded in the basement where age-old rubbish lay in great\nconfusion. Then there was a cry of fire. But the owner of\nthe house who was interested in everything except the management\nof his property, did not know how to put the small blaze\nout. The flame spread rapidly and the entire edifice was consumed\nby the conflagration, which we call the Great French Revolution.",
        "For the sake of convenience, we can divide the French\nRevolution into two parts. From 1789 to 1791 there was a\nmore or less orderly attempt to introduce a constitutional\nmonarchy. This failed, partly through lack of good faith and\nstupidity on the part of the monarch himself, partly through\ncircumstances over which nobody had any control.",
        "From 1792 to 1799 there was a Republic and a first effort\nto establish a democratic form of government. But the actual\noutbreak of violence had been preceded by many years of\nunrest and many sincere but ineffectual attempts at reform.",
        "When France had a debt of 4000 million francs and the\ntreasury was always empty and there was not a single thing\nupon which new taxes could be levied, even good King Louis\n(who was an expert locksmith and a great hunter but a very\npoor statesman) felt vaguely that something ought to be done.\nTherefore he called for Turgot, to be his Minister of Finance.\nAnne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de l’Aulne, a man in the\nearly sixties, a splendid representative of the fast disappearing\nclass of landed gentry, had been a successful governor of a\nprovince and was an amateur political economist of great ability.\nHe did his best. Unfortunately, he could not perform\nmiracles. As it was impossible to squeeze more taxes out of\nthe ragged peasants, it was necessary to get the necessary funds\nfrom the nobility and clergy who had never paid a centime.\nThis made Turgot the best hated man at the court of Versailles.\nFurthermore he was obliged to face the enmity of Marie\nAntoinette, the queen, who was against everybody who dared\nto mention the word “economy” within her hearing. Soon\nTurgot was called an “unpractical visionary” and a “theoretical-\nprofessor” and then of course his position became untenable.\nIn the year 1776 he was forced to resign.",
        "After the “professor” there came a man of Practical Business\nSense. He was an industrious Swiss by the name of\nNecker who had made himself rich as a grain speculator and\nthe partner in an international banking house. His ambitious\nwife had pushed him into the government service that she\nmight establish a position for her daughter who afterwards as\nthe wife of the Swedish minister in Paris, Baron de Stael,\nbecame a famous literary figure of the early nineteenth century.",
        "Necker set to work with a fine display of zeal just as Turgot\nhad done. In 1781 he published a careful review of the French\nfinances. The king understood nothing of this “Compte\nRendu.” He had just sent troops to America to help the colonists\nagainst their common enemies, the English. This expedition\nproved to be unexpectedly expensive and Necker was\nasked to find the necessary funds. When instead of producing\nrevenue, he published more figures and made statistics\nand began to use the dreary warning about “necessary economies\"\nhis days were numbered. In the year 1781 he was\ndismissed as an incompetent servant.",
        "After the Professor and the Practical Business Man came\nthe delightful type of financier who will guarantee everybody\n100 per cent. per month on their money if only they will\ntrust his own infallible system.",
        "He was Charles Alexandre de Calonne, a pushing official,\nwho had made his career both by his industry and his\ncomplete lack of honesty and scruples. He found the country\nheavily indebted, but he was a clever man, willing to oblige\neverybody, and he invented a quick remedy. He paid the\nold debts by contracting new ones. This method is not new.\nThe result since time immemorial has been disastrous. In\nless than three years more than 800,000,000 francs had been\nadded to the French debt by this charming Minister of Finance\nwho never worried and smilingly signed his name to every\ndemand that was made by His Majesty and by his lovely\nQueen, who had learned the habit of spending during the days\nof her youth in Vienna.",
        "At last even the Parliament of Paris (a high court of justice\nand not a legislative body) although by no means lacking\nin loyalty to their sovereign, decided that something must be\ndone. Calonne wanted to borrow another 80,000,000 francs.\nIt had been a bad year for the crops and the misery and hunger\nin the country districts were terrible. Unless something sensible\nwere done, France would go bankrupt. The King as always\nwas unaware of the seriousness of the situation. Would it not\nbe a good idea to consult the representatives of the people?\nSince 1614 no Estates General had been called together. In\nview of the threatening panic there was a demand that the\nEstates be convened. Louis XVI however, who never could\ntake a decision, refused to go as far as that.",
        "To pacify the popular clamour he called together a meeting\nof the Notables in the year 1787. This merely meant a gathering\nof the best families who discussed what could and should\nbe done, without touching their feudal and clerical privilege\nof tax-exemption. It is unreasonable to expect that a certain\nclass of society shall commit political and economic suicide for\nthe benefit of another group of fellow-citizens. The 127\nNotables obstinately refused to surrender a single one of their\nancient rights. The crowd in the street, being now exceedingly\nhungry, demanded that Necker, in whom they had confidence,\nbe reappointed. The Notables said “No.” The crowd\nin the street began to smash windows and do other unseemly\nthings. The Notables fled. Calonne was dismissed.",
        "A new colourless Minister of Finance, the Cardinal\nLomenie de Brienne, was appointed and Louis, driven by the\nviolent threats of his starving subjects, agreed to call together\nthe old Estates General as “soon as practicable.” This vague\npromise of course satisfied no one.",
        "No such severe winter had been experienced for almost a\ncentury. The crops had been either destroyed by floods or had\nbeen frozen to death in the fields. All the olive trees of the\nProvence had been killed. Private charity tried to do some-\nthing but could accomplish little for eighteen million starving\npeople. Everywhere bread riots occurred. A generation before\nthese would have been put down by the army. But the\nwork of the new philosophical school had begun to bear fruit.\nPeople began to understand that a shotgun is no effective\nremedy for a hungry stomach and even the soldiers (who came\nfrom among the people) were no longer to be depended upon.\nIt was absolutely necessary that the king should do something\ndefinite to regain the popular goodwill, but again he hesitated.",
        "Here and there in the provinces, little independent Republics\nwere established by followers of the new school. The cry\nof “no taxation without representation” (the slogan of the\nAmerican rebels a quarter of a century before) was heard\namong the faithful middle classes. France was threatened with\ngeneral anarchy. To appease the people and to increase the\nroyal popularity, the government unexpectedly suspended the\nformer very strict form of censorship of books. At once a\nflood of ink descended upon France. Everybody, high or\nlow, criticised and was criticised. More than 2000\npamphlets were published. Lomenie de Brienne was swept away\nby a storm of abuse. Necker was hastily called back to placate,\nas best he could, the nation-wide unrest. Immediately the stock\nmarket went up thirty per cent. And by common consent, people\nsuspended judgment for a little while longer. In May of\n1789 the Estates General were to assemble and then the wisdom\nof the entire nation would speedily solve the difficult problem\nof recreating the kingdom of France into a healthy and happy\nstate.",
        "This prevailing idea, that the combined wisdom of the\npeople would be able to solve all difficulties, proved disastrous.\nIt lamed all personal effort during many important months.\nInstead of keeping the government in his own hands at this\ncritical moment, Necker allowed everything to drift. Hence\nthere was a new outbreak of the acrimonious debate upon the\nbest ways to reform the old kingdom. Everywhere the power\nof the police weakened. The people of the Paris suburbs,\nunder the leadership of professional agitators, gradually began\nto discover their strength, and commenced to play the role\nwhich was to be theirs all through the years of the great unrest,\nwhen they acted as the brute force which was used by the actual\nleaders of the Revolution to secure those things which could\nnot be obtained in a legitimate fashion.",
        "As a sop to the peasants and the middle class, Necker de-\ncided that they should be allowed a double representation in\nthe Estates General. Upon this subject, the Abbe Sieyes then\nwrote a famous pamphlet, “To what does the Third Estate\nAmount?” in which he came to the conclusion that the Third\nEstate (a name given to the middle class) ought to amount to\neverything, that it had not amounted to anything in the past,\nand that it now desired to amount to something. He expressed\nthe sentiment of the great majority of the people who had the\nbest interests of the country at heart.",
        "Finally the elections took place under the worst conditions\nimaginable. When they were over, 308 clergymen, 285 noblemen\nand 621 representatives of the Third Estate packed their\ntrunks to go to Versailles. The Third Estate was obliged to\ncarry additional luggage. This consisted of voluminous reports\ncalled “cahiers” in which the many complaints and grievances\nof their constituents had been written down. The stage\nwas set for the great final act that was to save France.",
        "The Estates General came together on May 5th, 1789.\nThe king was in a bad humour. The Clergy and the Nobility\nlet it be known that they were unwilling to give up a single one\nof their privileges. The king ordered the three groups of\nrepresentatives to meet in different rooms and discuss their\ngrievances separately. The Third Estate refused to obey the royal\ncommand. They took a solemn oath to that effect in a squash\ncourt (hastily put in order for the purpose of this illegal meeting)\non the 20th of June, 1789. They insisted that all three\nEstates, Nobility, Clergy and Third Estate, should meet together\nand so informed His Majesty. The king gave in.",
        "As the “National Assembly,” the Estates General began\nto discuss the state of the French kingdom. The King got\nangry. Then again he hesitated. He said that he would never\nsurrender his absolute power. Then he went hunting, forgot\nall about the cares of the state and when he returned from the\nchase he gave in. For it was the royal habit to do the right\nthing at the wrong time in the wrong way. When the people\nclamoured for A, the king scolded them and gave them nothing.\nThen, when the Palace was surrounded by a howling multitude\nof poor people, the king surrendered and gave his subjects\nwhat they had asked for. By this time, however, the people\nwanted A plus B. The comedy was repeated. When the king\nsigned his name to the Royal Decree which granted his beloved\nsubjects A and B they were threatening to kill the entire royal\nfamily unless they received A plus B plus C. And so on,\nthrough the whole alphabet and up to the scaffold.",
        "Unfortunately the king was always just one letter behind.\nHe never understood this. Even when he laid his head under\nthe guillotine, he felt that he was a much-abused man who had\nreceived a most unwarrantable treatment at the hands of people\nwhom he had loved to the best of his limited ability.",
        "Historical “ifs,” as I have often warned you, are never of\nany value. It is very easy for us to say that the monarchy\nmight have been saved “if” Louis had been a man of greater\nenergy and less kindness of heart. But the king was not alone.\nEven “if” he had possessed the ruthless strength of Napoleon,\nhis career during these difficult days might have been easily\nruined by his wife who was the daughter of Maria Theresa of\nAustria and who possessed all the characteristic virtues and\nvices of a young girl who had been brought up at the most\nautocratic and mediaeval court of that age.",
        "She decided that some action must be taken and planned a\ncounter-revolution. Necker was suddenly dismissed and loyal\ntroops were called to Paris. The people, when they heard of\nthis, stormed the fortress of the Bastille prison, and on the\nfourteenth of July of the year 1789, they destroyed this\nfamiliar but much-hated symbol of Autocratic Power\nwhich had long since ceased to be a political prison and\nwas now used as the city lock-up for pickpockets and second-\nstory men. Many of the nobles took the hint and left the\ncountry. But the king as usual did nothing. He had been\nhunting on the day of the fall of the Bastille and he had shot\nseveral deer and felt very much pleased.",
        "The National Assembly now set to work and on the 4th of\nAugust, with the noise of the Parisian multitude in their ears,\nthey abolished all privileges. This was followed on the 27th\nof August by the “Declaration of the Rights of Man,” the\nfamous preamble to the first French constitution. So far so\ngood, but the court had apparently not yet learned its lesson.\nThere was a wide-spread suspicion that the king was again\ntrying to interfere with these reforms and as a result, on the\n5th of October, there was a second riot in Paris. It spread to\nVersailles and the people were not pacified until they had\nbrought the king back to his palace in Paris. They did not\ntrust him in Versailles. They liked to have him where they\ncould watch him and control his correspondence with his relatives\nin Vienna and Madrid and the other courts of Europe.",
        "In the Assembly meanwhile, Mirabeau, a nobleman who\nhad become leader of the Third Estate, was beginning to put\norder into chaos. But before he could save the position of the\nking he died, on the 2nd of April of the year 1791. The king,\nwho now began to fear for his own life, tried to escape on the\n21st of June. He was recognised from his picture on a coin,\nwas stopped near the village of Varennes by members of the\nNational Guard, and was brought back to Paris,",
        "In September of 1791, the first constitution of France was\naccepted, and the members of the National Assembly went\nhome. On the first of October of 1791, the legislative assembly\ncame together to continue the work of the National\nAssembly. In this new gathering of popular representatives\nthere were many extremely revolutionary elements. The\nboldest among these were known as the Jacobins, after the old\nJacobin cloister in which they held their political meetings.\nThese young men (most of them belonging to the professional\nclasses) made very violent speeches and when the newspapers\ncarried these orations to Berlin and Vienna, the King of\nPrussia and the Emperor decided that they must do something\nto save their good brother and sister. They were very busy\njust then dividing the kingdom of Poland, where rival political\nfactions had caused such a state of disorder that the country\nwas at the mercy of anybody who wanted to take a couple of\nprovinces. But they managed to send an army to invade\nFrance and deliver the king.",
        "Then a terrible panic of fear swept throughout the land\nof France. All the pent-up hatred of years of hunger and\nsuffering came to a horrible climax. The mob of Paris stormed\nthe palace of the Tuilleries. The faithful Swiss bodyguards\ntried to defend their master, but Louis, unable to make up his\nmind, gave order to “cease firing” just when the crowd was\nretiring. The people, drunk with blood and noise and cheap\nwine, murdered the Swiss to the last man, then invaded the\npalace, and went after Louis who had escaped into the meeting\nhall of the Assembly, where he was immediately suspended of\nhis office, and from where he was taken as a prisoner to the\nold castle of the Temple.",
        "But the armies of Austria and Prussia continued their advance\nand the panic changed into hysteria and turned men and\nwomen into wild beasts. In the first week of September of\nthe year 1792, the crowd broke into the jails and murdered all\nthe prisoners. The government did not interfere. The Jacobins,\nheaded by Danton, knew that this crisis meant either the\nsuccess or the failure of the revolution, and that only the most\nbrutal audacity could save them. The Legislative Assembly\nwas closed and on the 21st of September of the year 1792, a\nnew National Convention came together. It was a body composed\nalmost entirely of extreme revolutionists. The king was\nformally accused of high treason and was brought before the\nConvention. He was found guilty and by a vote of 361 to 360\n(the extra vote being that of his cousin the Duke of Orleans)\nhe was condemned to death. On the 21st of January of the\nyear 1793, he quietly and with much dignity suffered himself\nto be taken to the scaffold. He had never understood what all\nthe shooting and the fuss had been about. And he had been too\nproud to ask questions.",
        "Then the Jacobins turned against the more moderate element\nin the convention, the Girondists, called after their southern\ndistrict, the Gironde. A special revolutionary tribunal was\ninstituted and twenty-one of the leading Girondists were\ncondemned to death. The others committed suicide. They were\ncapable and honest men but too philosophical and too moderate\nto survive during these frightful years.",
        "In October of the year 1793 the Constitution was\nsuspended by the Jacobins “until peace should have been\ndeclared.” All power was placed in the hands of a small committee\nof Public Safety, with Danton and Robespierre as its\nleaders. The Christian religion and the old chronology were\nabolished. The “Age of Reason” (of which Thomas Paine had\nwritten so eloquently during the American Revolution) had\ncome and with it the “Terror” which for more than a year killed\ngood and bad and indifferent people at the rate of seventy or\neighty a day.",
        "The autocratic rule of the King had been destroyed. It\nwas succeeded by the tyranny of a few people who had such a\npassionate love for democratic virtue that they felt compelled\nto kill all those who disagreed with them. France was turned\ninto a slaughter house. Everybody suspected everybody else.\nNo one felt safe. Out of sheer fear, a few members of the old\nConvention, who knew that they were the next candidates for\nthe scaffold, finally turned against Robespierre, who had\nalready decapitated most of his former colleagues. Robespierre,\n\"the only true and pure Democrat,” tried to kill himself\nbut failed His shattered jaw was hastily bandaged and\nhe was dragged to the guillotine. On the 27th of July, of the\nyear 1794 (the 9th Thermidor of the year II, according to the\nstrange chronology of the revolution), the reign of Terror came\nto an end, and all Paris danced with joy.",
        "The dangerous position of France, however, made it necessary\nthat the government remain in the hands of a few strong\nmen, until the many enemies of the revolution should have been\ndriven from the soil of the French fatherland. While the\nhalf-clad and half-starved revolutionary armies fought their\ndesperate battles of the Rhine and Italy and Belgium and\nEgypt, and defeated every one of the enemies of the Great\nRevolution, five Directors were appointed, and they ruled\nFrance for four years. Then the power was vested in the hands\nof a successful general by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte,\nwho became “First Consul” of France in the year 1799. And\nduring the next fifteen years, the old European continent became\nthe laboratory of a number of political experiments, the\nlike of which the world had never seen before.",
        "NAPOLEON",
        "NAPOLEON was born in the year 1769, the third son\nof Carlo Maria Buonaparte, an honest notary public of\nthe city of Ajaccio in the island of Corsica, and his good\nwife, Letizia Ramolino. He therefore was not a Frenchman,\nbut an Italian whose native island (an old Greek, Carthaginian\nand Roman colony in the Mediterranean Sea) had\nfor years been struggling to regain its independence,\nfirst of all from the Genoese, and after the middle of the\neighteenth century from the French, who had kindly offered\nto help the Corsicans in their struggle for freedom and had\nthen occupied the island for their own benefit.",
        "During the first twenty years of his life, young Napoleon\nwas a professional Corsican patriot–a Corsican Sinn Feiner,\nwho hoped to deliver his beloved country from the yoke of the\nbitterly hated French enemy. But the French revolution had\nunexpectedly recognised the claims of the Corsicans and gradually\nNapoleon, who had received a good training at the military\nschool of Brienne, drifted into the service of his adopted country.\nAlthough he never learned to spell French correctly or\nto speak it without a broad Italian accent, he became a Frenchman.\nIn due time he came to stand as the highest expression\nof all French virtues. At present he is regarded as the symbol\nof the Gallic genius.",
        "Napoleon was what is called a fast worker. His career\ndoes not cover more than twenty years. In that short span\nof time he fought more wars and gained more victories and\nmarched more miles and conquered more square kilometers and\nkilled more people and brought about more reforms and generally\nupset Europe to a greater extent than anybody (including\nAlexander the Great and Jenghis Khan) had ever managed\nto do.",
        "He was a little fellow and during the first years of his life\nhis health was not very good. He never impressed anybody\nby his good looks and he remained to the end of his days very\nclumsy whenever he was obliged to appear at a social function.\nHe did not enjoy a single advantage of breeding or birth or\nriches. For the greater part of his youth he was desperately\npoor and often he had to go without a meal or was obliged\nto make a few extra pennies in curious ways.",
        "He gave little promise as a literary genius. When he competed\nfor a prize offered by the Academy of Lyons, his essay\nwas found to be next to the last and he was number 15 out of\n16 candidates. But he overcame all these difficulties through\nhis absolute and unshakable belief in his own destiny, and in\nhis own glorious future. Ambition was the main-spring of his\nlife. The thought of self, the worship of that capital letter\n\"N” with which he signed all his letters, and which recurred\nforever in the ornaments of his hastily constructed palaces, the\nabsolute will to make the name Napoleon the most important\nthing in the world next to the name of God, these desires carried\nNapoleon to a pinnacle of fame which no other man has\never reached.",
        "When he was a half-pay lieutenant, young Bonaparte was\nvery fond of the “Lives of Famous Men” which Plutarch, the\nRoman historian, had written. But he never tried to live up\nto the high standard of character set by these heroes of the\nolder days. Napoleon seems to have been devoid of all those\nconsiderate and thoughtful sentiments which make men\ndifferent from the animals. It will be very difficult to decide\nwith any degree of accuracy whether he ever loved anyone\nbesides himself. He kept a civil tongue to his mother, but\nLetizia had the air and manners of a great lady and after the\nfashion of Italian mothers, she knew how to rule her brood of\nchildren and command their respect. For a few years he was\nfond of Josephine, his pretty Creole wife, who was the daughter\nof a French officer of Martinique and the widow of the\nVicomte de Beauharnais, who had been executed by Robespierre\nwhen he lost a battle against the Prussians. But\nthe Emperor divorced her when she failed to give him a son\nand heir and married the daughter of the Austrian Emperor,\nbecause it seemed good policy.",
        "During the siege of Toulon, where he gained great fame\nas commander of a battery, Napoleon studied Macchiavelli\nwith industrious care. He followed the advice of the Florentine\nstatesman and never kept his word when it was to his\nadvantage to break it. The word “gratitude” did not occur in\nhis personal dictionary. Neither, to be quite fair, did he expect\nit from others. He was totally indifferent to human suffering.\nHe executed prisoners of war (in Egypt in 1798) who had\nbeen promised their lives, and he quietly allowed his wounded\nin Syria to be chloroformed when he found it impossible to\ntransport them to his ships. He ordered the Duke of Enghien\nto be condemned to death by a prejudiced court-martial and to\nbe shot contrary to all law on the sole ground that the\n\"Bourbons needed a warning.” He decreed that those German\nofficers who were made prisoner while fighting for their\ncountry’s independence should be shot against the nearest wall,\nand when Andreas Hofer, the Tyrolese hero, fell into his hands\nafter a most heroic resistance, he was executed like a common\ntraitor.",
        "In short, when we study the character of the Emperor, we\nbegin to understand those anxious British mothers who used\nto drive their children to bed with the threat that “Bonaparte,\nwho ate little boys and girls for breakfast, would come and get\nthem if they were not very good.” And yet, having said these\nmany unpleasant things about this strange tyrant, who looked\nafter every other department of his army with the utmost care,\nbut neglected the medical service, and who ruined his uniforms\nwith Eau de Cologne because he could not stand the smell of\nhis poor sweating soldiers; having said all these unpleasant\nthings and being fully prepared to add many more, I must\nconfess to a certain lurking feeling of doubt.",
        "Here I am sitting at a comfortable table loaded heavily\nwith books, with one eye on my typewriter and the other on\nLicorice the cat, who has a great fondness for carbon paper,\nand I am telling you that the Emperor Napoleon was a most\ncontemptible person. But should I happen to look out of\nthe window, down upon Seventh Avenue, and should the endless\nprocession of trucks and carts come to a sudden halt, and\nshould I hear the sound of the heavy drums and see the little\nman on his white horse in his old and much-worn green uniform,\nthen I don’t know, but I am afraid that I would leave\nmy books and the kitten and my home and everything else to\nfollow him wherever he cared to lead. My own grandfather\ndid this and Heaven knows he was not born to be a hero.\nMillions of other people’s grandfathers did it. They received\nno reward, but they expected none. They cheerfully\ngave legs and arms and lives to serve this foreigner, who took\nthem a thousand miles away from their homes and marched\nthem into a barrage of Russian or English or Spanish or\nItalian or Austrian cannon and stared quietly into space while\nthey were rolling in the agony of death.",
        "If you ask me for an explanation, I must answer that I\nhave none. I can only guess at one of the reasons. Napoleon\nwas the greatest of actors and the whole European continent\nwas his stage. At all times and under all circumstances\nhe knew the precise attitude that would impress the spectators\nmost and he understood what words would make the deepest\nimpression. Whether he spoke in the Egyptian desert, before\nthe backdrop of the Sphinx and the pyramids, or addressed\nhis shivering men on the dew-soaked plains of Italy, made no\ndifference. At all times he was master of the situation. Even\nat the end, an exile on a little rock in the middle of the Atlantic,\na sick man at the mercy of a dull and intolerable British governor,\nhe held the centre of the stage.",
        "After the defeat of Waterloo, no one outside of a few\ntrusted friends ever saw the great Emperor. The people of\nEurope knew that he was living on the island of St. Helena–\nthey knew that a British garrison guarded him day and night\n–they knew that the British fleet guarded the garrison which\nguarded the Emperor on his farm at Longwood. But he was\nnever out of the mind of either friend or enemy. When illness\nand despair had at last taken him away, his silent eyes continued\nto haunt the world. Even to-day he is as much of a force\nin the life of France as a hundred years ago when people\nfainted at the mere sight of this sallow-faced man who stabled\nhis horses in the holiest temples of the Russian Kremlin, and\nwho treated the Pope and the mighty ones of this earth as if\nthey were his lackeys.",
        "To give you a mere outline of his life would demand\ncouple of volumes. To tell you of his great political reform\nof the French state, of his new codes of laws which were\nadopted in most European countries, of his activities in every\nfield of public activity, would take thousands of pages. But\nI can explain in a few words why he was so successful during\nthe first part of his career and why he failed during the last\nten years. From the year 1789 until the year 1804, Napoleon\nwas the great leader of the French revolution. He was not\nmerely fighting for the glory of his own name. He defeated\nAustria and Italy and England and Russia because he, himself,\nand his soldiers were the apostles of the new creed of\n\"Liberty, Fraternity and Equality” and were the enemies of\nthe courts while they were the friends of the people.",
        "But in the year 1804, Napoleon made himself Hereditary\nEmperor of the French and sent for Pope Pius VII to come\nand crown him, even as Leo III, in the year 800 had crowned\nthat other great King of the Franks, Charlemagne, whose example\nwas constantly before Napoleon’s eyes.",
        "Once upon the throne, the old revolutionary chieftain became\nan unsuccessful imitation of a Habsburg monarch. He\nforgot his spiritual Mother, the Political Club of the Jacobins.\nHe ceased to be the defender of the oppressed. He became the\nchief of all the oppressors and kept his shooting squads ready\nto execute those who dared to oppose his imperial will. No\none had shed a tear when in the year 1806 the sad remains of\nthe Holy Roman Empire were carted to the historical dustbin\nand when the last relic of ancient Roman glory was destroyed\nby the grandson of an Italian peasant. But when the Napoleonic\narmies had invaded Spain, had forced the Spaniards to\nrecognise a king whom they detested, had massacred the poor\nMadrilenes who remained faithful to their old rulers, then\npublic opinion turned against the former hero of Marengo and\nAusterlitz and a hundred other revolutionary battles. Then\nand only then, when Napoleon was no longer the hero of the\nrevolution but the personification of all the bad traits of the\nOld Regime, was it possible for England to give direction to\nthe fast-spreading sentiment of hatred which was turning all\nhonest men into enemies of the French Emperor.",
        "The English people from the very beginning had felt\ndeeply disgusted when their newspapers told them the gruesome\ndetails of the Terror. They had staged their own great\nrevolution (during the reign of Charles I) a century before.\nIt had been a very simple affair compared to the upheaval of\nParis. In the eyes of the average Englishman a Jacobin was\na monster to be shot at sight and Napoleon was the Chief Devil.\nThe British fleet had blockaded France ever since the year\n1798. It had spoiled Napoleon’s plan to invade India by way\nof Egypt and had forced him to beat an ignominious retreat,\nafter his victories along the banks of the Nile. And finally,\nin the year 1805, England got the chance it had waited for so\nlong.",
        "Near Cape Trafalgar on the southwestern coast of Spain,\nNelson annihilated the Napoleonic fleet, beyond a possible\nchance of recovery. From that moment on, the Emperor was\nlandlocked. Even so, he would have been able to maintain\nhimself as the recognised ruler of the continent had he understood\nthe signs of the times and accepted the honourable peace\nwhich the powers offered him. But Napoleon had been blinded\nby the blaze of his own glory. He would recognise no equals.\nHe could tolerate no rivals. And his hatred turned against\nRussia, the mysterious land of the endless plains with its\ninexhaustible supply of cannon-fodder.",
        "As long as Russia was ruled by Paul I, the half-witted son\nof Catherine the Great, Napoleon had known how to deal with\nthe situation. But Paul grew more and more irresponsible\nuntil his exasperated subjects were obliged to murder him\n(lest they all be sent to the Siberian lead-mines) and the son of\nPaul, the Emperor Alexander, did not share his father’s affection\nfor the usurper whom he regarded as the enemy of mankind,\nthe eternal disturber of the peace. He was a pious man\nwho believed that he had been chosen by God to deliver the\nworld from the Corsican curse. He joined Prussia and England\nand Austria and he was defeated. He tried five times\nand five times he failed. In the year 1812 he once more taunted\nNapoleon until the French Emperor, in a blind rage, vowed\nthat he would dictate peace in Moscow. Then, from far and\nwide, from Spain and Germany and Holland and Italy and\nPortugal, unwilling regiments were driven northward, that the\nwounded pride of the great Emperor might be duly avenged.\nThe rest of the story is common knowledge. After a march\nof two months, Napoleon reached the Russian capital and\nestablished his headquarters in the holy Kremlin. On the night\nof September 15 of the year 1812, Moscow caught fire. The\ntown burned four days. When the evening of the fifth day\ncame, Napoleon gave the order for the retreat. Two weeks\nlater it began to snow. The army trudged through mud and\nsleet until November the 26th when the river Berezina was\nreached. Then the Russian attacks began in all seriousness.\nThe Cossacks swarmed around the “Grande Armee” which\nwas no longer an army but a mob. In the middle of December\nthe first of the survivors began to be seen in the German cities\nof the East.",
        "Then there were many rumours of an impending revolt.\n\"The time has come,” the people of Europe said, “to free ourselves\nfrom this insufferable yoke.” And they began to look\nfor old shotguns which had escaped the eye of the ever-present\nFrench spies. But ere they knew what had happened, Napoleon\nwas back with a new army. He had left his defeated soldiers\nand in his little sleigh had rushed ahead to Paris, making\na final appeal for more troops that he might defend the sacred\nsoil of France against foreign invasion.",
        "Children of sixteen and seventeen followed him when he\nmoved eastward to meet the allied powers. On October 16,\n18, and 19 of the year 1813, the terrible battle of Leipzig took\nplace where for three days boys in green and boys in blue\nfought each other until the Elbe ran red with blood. On the\nafternoon of the 17th of October, the massed reserves of Russian\ninfantry broke through the French lines and Napoleon\nfled.",
        "Back to Paris he went. He abdicated in favour of his small\nson, but the allied powers insisted that Louis XVIII, the\nbrother of the late king Louis XVI, should occupy the French\nthrone, and surrounded by Cossacks and Uhlans, the dull-eyed\nBourbon prince made his triumphal entry into Paris.",
        "As for Napoleon he was made the sovereign ruler of the\nlittle island of Elba in the Mediterranean where he organised\nhis stable boys into a miniature army and fought battles on a\nchess board.",
        "But no sooner had he left France than the people began\nto realise what they had lost. The last twenty years, however\ncostly, had been a period of great glory. Paris had been the\ncapital of the world. The fat Bourbon king who had learned\nnothing and had forgotten nothing during the days of his\nexile disgusted everybody by his indolence.",
        "On the first of March of the year 1815, when the representatives\nof the allies were ready to begin the work of unscrambling\nthe map of Europe, Napoleon suddenly landed near\nCannes. In less than a week the French army had deserted\nthe Bourbons and had rushed southward to offer their swords\nand bayonets to the “little Corporal.” Napoleon marched\nstraight to Paris where he arrived on the twentieth of March.\nThis time he was more cautious. He offered peace, but the\nallies insisted upon war. The whole of Europe arose against\nthe “perfidious Corsican.” Rapidly the Emperor marched\nnorthward that he might crush his enemies before they should\nbe able to unite their forces. But Napoleon was no longer his\nold self. He felt sick. He got tired easily. He slept when he\nought to have been up directing the attack of his advance-\nguard. Besides, he missed many of his faithful old generals.\nThey were dead.",
        "Early in June his armies entered Belgium. On the 16th\nof that month he defeated the Prussians under Blucher. But\na subordinate commander failed to destroy the retreating army\nas he had been ordered to do.",
        "Two days later, Napoleon met Wellington near Waterloo.\nIt was the 18th of June, a Sunday. At two o’clock of the\nafternoon, the battle seemed won for the French. At three a\nspeck of dust appeared upon the eastern horizon. Napoleon\nbelieved that this meant the approach of his own cavalry who\nwould now turn the English defeat into a rout. At four o’clock\nhe knew better. Cursing and swearing, old Blucher drove\nhis deathly tired troops into the heart of the fray. The shock\nbroke the ranks of the guards. Napoleon had no further reserves.\nHe told his men to save themselves as best they could,\nand he fled.",
        "For a second time, he abdicated in favor of his son. Just\none hundred days after his escape from Elba, he was making\nfor the coast. He intended to go to America. In the year\n1803, for a mere song, he had sold the French colony of\nLouisiana (which was in great danger of being captured by\nthe English) to the young American Republic. “The Americans,\"\nso he said, “will be grateful and will give me a little bit\nof land and a house where I may spend the last days of my life\nin peace and quiet.” But the English fleet was watching all\nFrench harbours. Caught between the armies of the Allies\nand the ships of the British, Napoleon had no choice. The\nPrussians intended to shoot him. The English might be more\ngenerous. At Rochefort he waited in the hope that something\nmight turn up. One month after Waterloo, he received orders\nfrom the new French government to leave French soil inside\nof twenty-four hours. Always the tragedian, he wrote a letter\nto the Prince Regent of England (George IV, the king, was\nin an insane asylum) informing His Royal Highness of his\nintention to “throw himself upon the mercy of his enemies and\nlike Themistocles, to look for a welcome at the fireside of his\nfoes . . .",
        "On the 15th of July he went on board the “Bellerophon,\"\nand surrendered his sword to Admiral Hotham. At Plymouth\nhe was transferred to the “Northumberland” which carried him\nto St. Helena. There he spent the last seven years of his\nlife. He tried to write his memoirs, he quarrelled with his\nkeepers and he dreamed of past times. Curiously enough he\nreturned (at least in his imagination) to his original point of\ndeparture. He remembered the days when he had fought the\nbattles of the Revolution. He tried to convince himself that\nhe had always been the true friend of those great principles of\n\"Liberty, Fraternity and Equality” which the ragged soldiers\nof the convention had carried to the ends of the earth. He\nliked to dwell upon his career as Commander-in-Chief and\nConsul. He rarely spoke of the Empire. Sometimes he\nthought of his son, the Duke of Reichstadt, the little eagle,\nwho lived in Vienna, where he was treated as a “poor relation\"\nby his young Habsburg cousins, whose fathers had trembled at\nthe very mention of the name of Him. When the end came,\nhe was leading his troops to victory. He ordered Ney to attack\nwith the guards. Then he died.",
        "But if you want an explanation of this strange career, if\nyou really wish to know how one man could possibly rule so\nmany people for so many years by the sheer force of his will,\ndo not read the books that have been written about him. Their\nauthors either hated the Emperor or loved him. You will\nlearn many facts, but it is more important to “feel history\"\nthan to know it. Don’t read, but wait until you have a chance\nto hear a good artist sing the song called “The Two Grenadiers.\"\nThe words were written by Heine, the great German\npoet who lived through the Napoleonic era. The music was\ncomposed by Schumann, a German who saw the Emperor,\nthe enemy of his country, whenever he came to visit his imperial\nfather-in-law. The song therefore is the work of two\nmen who had every reason to hate the tyrant.",
        "Go and hear it. Then you will understand what a thousand\nvolumes could not possibly tell you.",

The victory was duly celebrated with\ndinners, garden parties and balls at which the new and very\nshocking “waltz” was danced to the great scandal of the ladies\nand gentlemen who remembered the minuet of the old Regime.",
        "For almost a generation they had lived in retirement. At\nlast the danger was over. They were very eloquent upon the\nsubject of the terrible hardships which they had suffered.\nAnd they expected to be recompensed for every penny they\nhad lost at the hands of the unspeakable Jacobins who had\ndared to kill their anointed king, who had abolished wigs and\nwho had discarded the short trousers of the court of Versailles\nfor the ragged pantaloons of the Parisian slums.",
        "You may think it absurd that I should mention such a\ndetail. But, if you please, the Congress of Vienna was one\nlong succession of such absurdities and for many months the\nquestion of “short trousers vs. long trousers” interested the\ndelegates more than the future settlement of the Saxon or\nSpanish problems. His Majesty the King of Prussia went so\nfar as to order a pair of short ones, that he might give public\nevidence of his contempt for everything revolutionary.",
        "Another German potentate, not to be outdone in this noble\nhatred for the revolution, decreed that all taxes which his subjects\nhad paid to the French usurper should be paid a second\ntime to the legitimate ruler who had loved his people from afar\nwhile they were at the mercy of the Corsican ogre. And so on.\nFrom one blunder to another, until one gasps and exclaims\n\"but why in the name of High Heaven did not the people\nobject?” Why not indeed? Because the people were utterly\nexhausted, were desperate, did not care what happened or how\nor where or by whom they were ruled, provided there was\npeace. They were sick and tired of war and revolution and\nreform.",
        "In the eighties of the previous century they had all danced\naround the tree of liberty. Princes had embraced their cooks\nand Duchesses had danced the Carmagnole with their lackeys\nin the honest belief that the Millennium of Equality and\nFraternity had at last dawned upon this wicked world. Instead of\nthe Millennium they had been visited by the Revolutionary\ncommissary who had lodged a dozen dirty soldiers in their parlor\nand had stolen the family plate when he returned to Paris to\nreport to his government upon the enthusiasm with which the\n\"liberated country” had received the Constitution, which the\nFrench people had presented to their good neighbours.",
        "When they had heard how the last outbreak of revolutionary\ndisorder in Paris had been suppressed by a young officer, called\nBonaparte, or Buonaparte, who had turned his guns upon the\nmob, they gave a sigh of relief. A little less liberty, fraternity\nand equality seemed a very desirable thing. But ere long, the\nyoung officer called Buonaparte or Bonaparte became one of\nthe three consuls of the French Republic, then sole consul and\nfinally Emperor. As he was much more efficient than any\nruler that had ever been seen before, his hand pressed heavily\nupon his poor subjects. He showed them no mercy. He impressed\ntheir sons into his armies, he married their daughters\nto his generals and he took their pictures and their statues to\nenrich his own museums. He turned the whole of Europe\ninto an armed camp and killed almost an entire generation of\nmen.",
        "Now he was gone, and the people (except a few professional\nmilitary men) had but one wish. They wanted to be let alone.\nFor awhile they had been allowed to rule themselves, to vote\nfor mayors and aldermen and judges. The system had been a\nterrible failure. The new rulers had been inexperienced and\nextravagant. From sheer despair the people turned to the\nrepresentative men of the old Regime. “You rule us,” they\nsaid, “as you used to do. Tell us what we owe you for taxes\nand leave us alone. We are busy repairing the damage of the\nage of liberty.”",
        "The men who stage-managed the famous congress certainly\ndid their best to satisfy this longing for rest and quiet.\nThe Holy Alliance, the main result of the Congress, made the\npoliceman the most important dignitary of the State and held\nout the most terrible punishment to those who dared criticise a\nsingle official act.",

        "The three most important men at Vienna were the Emperor\nAlexander of Russia, Metternich, who represented the\ninterests of the Austrian house of Habsburg, and Talleyrand,\nthe erstwhile bishop of Autun, who had managed to live\nthrough the different changes in the French government by\nthe sheer force of his cunning and his intelligence and who\nnow travelled to the Austrian capital to save for his country\nwhatever could be saved from the Napoleonic ruin. Like the\ngay young man of the limerick, who never knew when he was\nslighted, this unbidden guest came to the party and ate just as\nheartily as if he had been really invited.

        "Before he had been in Vienna twenty-four hours he knew\nthat the allies were divided into two hostile camps. On the\none side were Russia, who wanted to take Poland, and Prussia,\nwho wanted to annex Saxony; and on the other side were\nAustria and England, who were trying to prevent this grab\nbecause it was against their own interest that either Prussia or\nRussia should be able to dominate Europe. Talleyrand played\nthe two sides against each other with great skill and it was due\nto his efforts that the French people were not made to suffer\nfor the ten years of oppression which Europe had endured at\nthe hands of the Imperial officials. He argued that the French\npeople had been given no choice in the matter. Napoleon had\nforced them to act at his bidding. But Napoleon was gone and\nLouis XVIII was on the throne. “Give him a chance,” Talleyrand\npleaded. And the Allies, glad to see a legitimate king\nupon the throne of a revolutionary country, obligingly yielded\nand the Bourbons were given their chance, of which they\nmade such use that they were driven out after fifteen years.",
        "The second man of the triumvirate of Vienna was Metternich,\nthe Austrian prime minister, the leader of the foreign\npolicy of the house of Habsburg. Wenzel Lothar, Prince of\nMetternich-Winneburg, was exactly what the name suggests.\nHe was a Grand Seigneur, a very handsome gentleman with\nvery fine manners, immensely rich, and very able, but the\nproduct of a society which lived a thousand miles away from\nthe sweating multitudes who worked and slaved in the cities\nand on the farms. As a young man, Metternich had been\nstudying at the University of Strassburg when the French\nRevolution broke out. Strassburg, the city which gave birth\nto the Marseillaise, had been a centre of Jacobin activities.\nMetternich remembered that his pleasant social life had been\nsadly interrupted, that a lot of incompetent citizens had suddenly\nbeen called forth to perform tasks for which they were\nnot fit, that the mob had celebrated the dawn of the new liberty\nby the murder of perfectly innocent persons. He had failed to\nsee the honest enthusiasm of the masses, the ray of hope in the\neyes of women and children who carried bread and water to\nthe ragged troops of the Convention, marching through the\ncity on their way to the front and a glorious death for the\nFrench Fatherland.",
        "The whole thing had filled the young Austrian with disgust.\nIt was uncivilised. If there were any fighting to be done it\nmust be done by dashing young men in lovely uniforms, charging\nacross the green fields on well-groomed horses. But to\nturn an entire country into an evil-smelling armed camp where\ntramps were overnight promoted to be generals, that was both\nwicked and senseless. “See what came of all your fine ideas,\"\nhe would say to the French diplomats whom he met at a quiet\nlittle dinner given by one of the innumerable Austrian grand-\ndukes. “You wanted liberty, equality and fraternity and you\ngot Napoleon. How much better it would have been if you\nhad been contented with the existing order of things.” And\nhe would explain his system of “stability.” He would advocate\na return to the normalcy of the good old days before the\nwar, when everybody was happy and nobody talked nonsense\nabout “everybody being as good as everybody else.” In this\nattitude he was entirely sincere and as he was an able man of\ngreat strength of will and a tremendous power of persuasion,\nhe was one of the most dangerous enemies of the Revolutionary\nideas. He did not die until the year 1859, and he therefore\nlived long enough to see the complete failure of all his policies\nwhen they were swept aside by the revolution of the year 1848.\nHe then found himself the most hated man of Europe and\nmore than once ran the risk of being lynched by angry crowds\nof outraged citizens. But until the very last, he remained steadfast\nin his belief that he had done the right thing.",
        "He had always been convinced that people preferred peace\nto liberty and he had tried to give them what was best for them.\nAnd in all fairness, it ought to be said that his efforts to\nestablish universal peace were fairly successful. The great powers\ndid not fly at each other’s throat for almost forty years, indeed\nnot until the Crimean war between Russia and England,\nFrance and Italy and Turkey, in the year 1854. That means\na record for the European continent.",
        "The third hero of this waltzing congress was the Emperor\nAlexander. He had been brought up at the court of his grand-\nmother, the famous Catherine the Great. Between the lessons\nof this shrewd old woman, who taught him to regard the glory\nof Russia as the most important thing in life, and those of his\nprivate tutor, a Swiss admirer of Voltaire and Rousseau, who\nfilled his mind with a general love of humanity, the boy grew\nup to be a strange mixture of a selfish tyrant and a sentimental\nrevolutionist. He had suffered great indignities during the\nlife of his crazy father, Paul I. He had been obliged to wit-\nness the wholesale slaughter of the Napoleonic battle-fields.\nThen the tide had turned. His armies had won the day for the\nAllies. Russia had become the saviour of Europe and the Tsar\nof this mighty people was acclaimed as a half-god who would\ncure the world of its many ills.",
        "But Alexander was not very clever. He did not know\nmen and women as Talleyrand and Metternich knew them.\nHe did not understand the strange game of diplomacy. He\nwas vain (who would not be under the circumstances?) and\nloved to hear the applause of the multitude and soon he had\nbecome the main “attraction” of the Congress while Metternich\nand Talleyrand and Castlereagh (the very able British\nrepresentative) sat around a table and drank a bottle of Tokay\nand decided what was actually going to be done. They needed\nRussia and therefore they were very polite to Alexander, but\nthe less he had personally to do with the actual work of the\nCongress, the better they were pleased. They even encouraged\nhis plans for a Holy Alliance that he might be fully occupied\nwhile they were engaged upon the work at hand.",
        "Alexander was a sociable person who liked to go to parties\nand meet people. Upon such occasions he was happy and gay\nbut there was a very different element in his character. He\ntried to forget something which he could not forget. On the\nnight of the 23rd of March of the year 1801 he had been sitting\nin a room of the St. Michael Palace in Petersburg, waiting for\nthe news of his father’s abdication. But Paul had refused to\nsign the document which the drunken officers had placed before\nhim on the table, and in their rage they had put a scarf\naround his neck and had strangled him to death. Then they\nhad gone downstairs to tell Alexander that he was Emperor of\nall the Russian lands.",
        "The memory of this terrible night stayed with the Tsar\nwho was a very sensitive person. He had been educated in\nthe school of the great French philosophers who did not believe\nin God but in Human Reason. But Reason alone could\nnot satisfy the Emperor in his predicament. He began to\nhear voices and see things. He tried to find a way by which\nhe could square himself with his conscience. He became very\npious and began to take an interest in mysticism, that strange\nlove of the mysterious and the unknown which is as old as the\ntemples of Thebes and Babylon.",
        "The tremendous emotion of the great revolutionary era\nhad influenced the character of the people of that day in a\nstrange way. Men and women who had lived through twenty\nyears of anxiety and fear were no longer quite normal. They\njumped whenever the door-bell rang. It might mean the news\nof the “death on the field of honour” of an only son. The\nphrases about “brotherly love” and “liberty” of the Revolution\nwere hollow words in the ears of sorely stricken peasants.\nThey clung to anything that might give them a new hold on\nthe terrible problems of life. In their grief and misery they\nwere easily imposed upon by a large number of imposters\nwho posed as prophets and preached a strange new doctrine\nwhich they dug out of the more obscure passages of the Book\nof Revelations.",
        "In the year 1814, Alexander, who had already consulted a\nlarge number of wonder-doctors, heard of a new seeress who\nwas foretelling the coming doom of the world and was exhorting\npeople to repent ere it be too late. The Baroness von\nKrudener, the lady in question, was a Russian woman of uncertain\nage and similar reputation who had been the wife of a\nRussian diplomat in the days of the Emperor Paul. She had\nsquandered her husband’s money and had disgraced him by\nher strange love affairs. She had lived a very dissolute life\nuntil her nerves had given way and for a while she was not in\nher right mind. Then she had been converted by the sight of\nthe sudden death of a friend. Thereafter she despised all\ngaiety. She confessed her former sins to her shoemaker, a\npious Moravian brother, a follower of the old reformer John\nHuss, who had been burned for his heresies by the Council of\nConstance in the year 1415.",
        "The next ten years the Baroness spent in Germany making\na specialty of the “conversion” of kings and princes. To convince\nAlexander, the Saviour of Europe, of the error of his\nways was the greatest ambition of her life. And as Alexander,\nin his misery, was willing to listen to anybody who brought him\na ray of hope, the interview was easily arranged. On the evening\nof the fourth of June of the year 1815, she was admitted\nto the tent of the Emperor. She found him reading his Bible.\nWe do not know what she said to Alexander, but when she\nleft him three hours later, he was bathed in tears, and vowed\nthat “at last his soul had found peace.” From that day on the\nBaroness was his faithful companion and his spiritual adviser.\nShe followed him to Paris and then to Vienna and the time\nwhich Alexander did not spend dancing he spent at the\nKrudener prayer-meetings.",
        "You may ask why I tell you this story in such great detail?\nAre not the social changes of the nineteenth century of greater\nimportance than the career of an ill-balanced woman who had\nbetter be forgotten? Of course they are, but there exist any\nnumber of books which will tell you of these other things with\ngreat accuracy and in great detail. I want you to learn something\nmore from this history than a mere succession of facts.\nI want you to approach all historical events in a frame of mind\nthat will take nothing for granted. Don’t be satisfied with\nthe mere statement that “such and such a thing happened then\nand there.” Try to discover the hidden motives behind every\naction and then you will understand the world around you\nmuch better and you will have a greater chance to help others,\nwhich (when all is said and done) is the only truly satisfactory\nway of living.",
        "I do not want you to think of the Holy Alliance as a piece\nof paper which was signed in the year 1815 and lies dead and\nforgotten somewhere in the archives of state. It may be forgotten\nbut it is by no means dead. The Holy Alliance was\ndirectly responsible for the promulgation of the Monroe\nDoctrine, and the Monroe Doctrine of America for the Americans\nhas a very distinct bearing upon your own life. That is\nthe reason why I want you to know exactly how this document\nhappened to come into existence and what the real motives were\nunderlying this outward manifestation of piety and Christian\ndevotion to duty.",
        "The Holy Alliance was the joint labour of an unfortunate\nman who had suffered a terrible mental shock and who was\ntrying to pacify his much-disturbed soul, and of an ambitious\nwoman who after a wasted life had lost her beauty and her\nattraction and who satisfied her vanity and her desire for\nnotoriety by assuming the role of self-appointed Messiah of a\nnew and strange creed. I am not giving away any secrets\nwhen I tell you these details. Such sober minded people as\nCastlereagh, Metternich and Talleyrand fully understood\nthe limited abilities of the sentimental Baroness. It would have\nbeen easy for Metternich to send her back to her German\nestates. A few lines to the almighty commander of the imperial\npolice and the thing was done.",
        "But France and England and Austria depended upon the\ngood-will of Russia. They could not afford to offend Alexander.\nAnd they tolerated the silly old Baroness because they\nhad to. And while they regarded the Holy Alliance as utter\nrubbish and not worth the paper upon which it was written,\nthey listened patiently to the Tsar when he read them the first\nrough draft of this attempt to create the Brotherhood of Men\nupon a basis of the Holy Scriptures. For this is what the\nHoly Alliance tried to do, and the signers of the document\nsolemnly declared that they would “in the administration of\ntheir respective states and in their political relations with every\nother government take for their sole guide the precepts of that\nHoly Religion, namely the precepts of Justice, Christian\nCharity and Peace, which far from being applicable only to\nprivate concerns must have an immediate influence on the\ncouncils of princes, and must guide all their steps as being the\nonly means of consolidating human institutions and remedying\ntheir imperfections.” They then proceeded to promise each\nother that they would remain united “by the bonds of a true\nand indissoluble fraternity, and considering each other as\nfellow-countrymen, they would on all occasions and in all places\nlend each other aid and assistance.” And more words to the\nsame effect.",
        "Eventually the Holy Alliance was signed by the Emperor\nof Austria, who did not understand a word of it. It was signed\nby the Bourbons who needed the friendship of Napoleon’s old\nenemies. It was signed by the King of Prussia, who hoped to\ngain Alexander for his plans for a “greater Prussia,” and by\nall the little nations of Europe who were at the mercy of Russia.\nEngland never signed, because Castlereagh thought the\nwhole thing buncombe. The Pope did not sign because he\nresented this interference in his business by a Greek-Orthodox\nand a Protestant. And the Sultan did not sign because he\nnever heard of it.",
        "The general mass of the European people, however, soon\nwere forced to take notice. Behind the hollow phrases of the\nHoly Alliance stood the armies of the Quintuple Alliance\nwhich Metternich had created among the great powers. These\narmies meant business. They let it be known that the peace\nof Europe must not be disturbed by the so-called liberals who\nwere in reality nothing but disguised Jacobins, and hoped for\na return of the revolutionary days. The enthusiasm for the\ngreat wars of liberation of the years 1812, 1818, 1814 and\n1815 had begun to wear off. It had been followed by a sincere\nbelief in the coming of a happier day. The soldiers who had\nborne the brunt of the battle wanted peace and they said so.",
        "But they did not want the sort of peace which the Holy\nAlliance and the Council of the European powers had now\nbestowed upon them. They cried that they had been betrayed.\nBut they were careful lest they be heard by a secret-police spy.\nThe reaction was victorious. It was a reaction caused by men\nwho sincerely believed that their methods were necessary for\nthe good of humanity. But it was just as hard to bear as if\ntheir intentions had been less kind. And it caused a great deal\nof unnecessary suffering and greatly retarded the orderly\nprogress of political development.",
        "THEY TRIED TO ASSURE THE WORLD AN ERA\nOF UNDISTURBED PEACE BY SUPPRESSING\nALL NEW IDEAS. THEY MADE THE\nPOLICE-SPY THE HIGHEST FUNCTIONARY\nIN THE STATE AND SOON THE PRISONS\nOF ALL COUNTRIES WERE FILLED WITH\nTHOSE WHO CLAIMED THAT PEOPLE\nHAVE THE RIGHT TO GOVERN THEMSELVES\nAS THEY SEE FIT",
        "To undo the damage done by the great Napoleonic flood\nwas almost impossible. Age-old fences had been washed away.\nThe palaces of two score dynasties had been damaged to such\nan extent that they had to be condemned as uninhabitable.\nOther royal residences had been greatly enlarged at the expense\nof less fortunate neighbours. Strange odds and ends\nof revolutionary doctrine had been left behind by the receding\nwaters and could not be dislodged without danger to the entire\ncommunity. But the political engineers of the Congress did\nthe best they could and this is what they accomplished.",
        "France had disturbed the peace of the world for so many\nyears that people had come to fear that country almost\ninstinctively. The Bourbons, through the mouth of Talleyrand,\nhad promised to be good, but the Hundred Days had taught\nEurope what to expect should Napoleon manage to escape for\na second time. The Dutch Republic, therefore, was changed\ninto a Kingdom, and Belgium (which had not joined the Dutch\nstruggle for independence in the sixteenth century and since\nthen had been part of the Habsburg domains, firs t under Spanish\nrule and thereafter under Austrian rule) was made part\nof this new kingdom of the Netherlands. Nobody wanted this\nunion either in the Protestant North or in the Catholic South,\nbut no questions were asked. It seemed good for the peace\nof Europe and that was the main consideration.",
        "Poland had hoped for great things because a Pole, Prince\nAdam Czartoryski, was one of the most intimate friends of\nTsar Alexander and had been his constant advisor during the\nwar and at the Congress of Vienna. But Poland was made a\nsemi-independent part of Russia with Alexander as her king.\nThis solution pleased no one and caused much bitter feeling\nand three revolutions.",
        "Denmark, which had remained a faithful ally of Napoleon\nuntil the end, was severely punished. Seven years before, an\nEnglish fleet had sailed down the Kattegat and without a\ndeclaration of war or any warning had bombarded Copenhagen\nand had taken away the Danish fleet, lest it be of value to\nNapoleon. The Congress of Vienna went one step further.\nIt took Norway (which since the union of Calmar of the year\n1397 had been united with Denmark) away from Denmark\nand gave it to Charles XIV of Sweden as a reward for his betrayal\nof Napoleon, who had set him up in the king business.\nThis Swedish king, curiously enough, was a former French general\nby the name of Bernadotte, who had come to Sweden as one\nof Napolean’s{sic} adjutants, and had been invited to the throne of\nthat good country when the last of the rulers of the house of\nHollstein-Gottorp had died without leaving either son or\ndaughter. From 1815 until 1844 he ruled his adopted country\n(the language of which he never learned) width great ability. He\nwas a clever man and enjoyed the respect of both his Swedish\nand his Norwegian subjects, but he did not succeed in joining\ntwo countries which nature and history had put asunder. The\ndual Scandinavian state was never a success and in 1905,\nNorway, in a most peaceful and orderly manner, set up as an\nindependent kingdom and the Swedes bade her “good speed\"\nand very wisely let her go her own way.",
        "The Italians, who since the days of the Renaissance had\nbeen at the mercy of a long series of invaders, also had put\ngreat hopes in General Bonaparte. The Emperor Napoleon,\nhowever, had grievously disappointed them. Instead of the\nUnited Italy which the people wanted, they had been divided\ninto a number of little principalities, duchies, republics and\nthe Papal State, which (next to Naples) was the worst governed\nand most miserable region of the entire peninsula. The\nCongress of Vienna abolished a few of the Napoleonic republics\nand in their place resurrected several old principalities\nwhich were given to deserving members, both male and female,\nof the Habsburg family.",
        "The poor Spaniards, who had started the great nationalistic\nrevolt against Napoleon, and who had sacrificed the best blood\nof the country for their king, were punished severely when the\nCongress allowed His Majesty to return to his domains. This\nvicious creature, known as Ferdinand VII, had spent the last\nfour years of his life as a prisoner of Napoleon. He had improved\nhis days by knitting garments for the statues of his\nfavourite patron saints. He celebrated his return by re-introducing\nthe Inquisition and the torture-chamber, both of which\nhad been abolished by the Revolution. He was a disgusting\nperson, despised as much by his subjects as by his four wives,\nbut the Holy Alliance maintained him upon his legitimate\nthrone and all efforts of the decent Spaniards to get rid of this\ncurse and make Spain a constitutional kingdom ended in\nbloodshed and executions.",
        "Portugal had been without a king since the year 1807 when\nthe royal family had fled to the colonies in Brazil. The country\nhad been used as a base of supply for the armies of\nWellington during the Peninsula war, which lasted from 1808\nuntil 1814. After 1815 Portugal continued to be a sort of\nBritish province until the house of Braganza returned to the\nthrone, leaving one of its members behind in Rio de Janeiro\nas Emperor of Brazil, the only American Empire which lasted\nfor more than a few years, and which came to an end in 1889\nwhen the country became a republic.",
        "In the east, nothing was done to improve the terrible conditions\nof both the Slavs and the Greeks who were still subjects\nof the Sultan. In the year 1804 Black George, a Servian\nswineherd, (the founder of the Karageorgevich dynasty) had\nstarted a revolt against the Turks, but he had been defeated\nby his enemies and had been murdered by one of his supposed\nfriends, the rival Servian leader, called Milosh Obrenovich,\n(who became the founder of the Obrenovich dynasty) and the\nTurks had continued to be the undisputed masters of the\nBalkans.",
        "The Greeks, who since the loss of their independence, two\nthousand years before, had been subjects of the Macedonians,\nthe Romans, the Venetians and the Turks, had hoped that their\ncountryman, Capo d’Istria, a native of Corfu and together\nwith Czartoryski, the most intimate personal friends of\nAlexander, would do something for them. But the Congress\nof Vienna was not interested in Greeks, but was very much\ninterested in keeping all “legitimate” monarchs, Christian,\nMoslem and otherwise, upon their respective thrones. Therefore\nnothing was done.",
        "The last, but perhaps the greatest blunder of the Congress\nwas the treatment of Germany. The Reformation and the\nThirty Years War had not only destroyed the prosperity of the\ncountry, but had turned it into a hopeless political rubbish\nheap, consisting of a couple of kingdoms, a few grand-duchies,\na large number of duchies and hundreds of margravates, principalities,\nbaronies, electorates, free cities and free villages,\nruled by the strangest assortment of potentates that was ever\nseen off the comic opera stage. Frederick the Great had\nchanged this when he created a strong Prussia, but this state\nhad not survived him by many years.",
        "Napoleon had blue-penciled the demand for independence\nof most of these little countries, and only fifty-two out of a\ntotal of more than three hundred had survived the year 1806.\nDuring the years of the great struggle for independence, many\na young soldier had dreamed of a new Fatherland that should\nbe strong and united. But there can be no union without a\nstrong leadership, and who was to be this leader?",
        "There were five kingdoms in the German speaking lands.\nThe rulers of two of these, Austria and Prussia, were kings by\nthe Grace of God. The rulers of three others, Bavaria, Saxony\nand Wurtemberg, were kings by the Grace of Napoleon, and\nas they had been the faithful henchmen of the Emperor, their\npatriotic credit with the other Germans was therefore not very\ngood.",
        "The Congress had established a new German Confederation,\na league of thirty-eight sovereign states, under the chairmanship\nof the King of Austria, who was now known as the\nEmperor of Austria. It was the sort of make-shift arrangement\nwhich satisfied no one. It is true that a German Diet,\nwhich met in the old coronation city of Frankfort. had been\ncreated to discuss matters of “common policy and importance.\"\nBut in this Diet, thirty-eight delegates represented thirty-eight\ndifferent interests and as no decision could be taken without a\nunanimous vote (a parliamentary rule which had in previous\ncenturies ruined the mighty kingdom of Poland), the famous\nGerman Confederation became very soon the laughing stock\nof Europe and the politics of the old Empire began to resemble\nthose of our Central American neighbours in the forties and\nthe fifties of the last century.",
        "It was terribly humiliating to the people who had sacrificed\neverything for a national ideal. But the Congress was not\ninterested in the private feelings of “subjects,” and the debate\nwas closed.",
        "Did anybody object? Most assuredly. As soon as the first\nfeeling of hatred against Napoleon had quieted down–as soon\nas the enthusiasm of the great war had subsided–as soon as\nthe people came to a full realisation of the crime that had been\ncommitted in the name of “peace and stability” they began to\nmurmur. They even made threats of open revolt. But what\ncould they do? They were powerless. They were at the mercy\nof the most pitiless and efficient police system the world had\never seen.",
        "The members of the Congress of Vienna honestly and sincerely\nbelieved that “the Revolutionary Principle had led to\nthe criminal usurpation of the throne by the former emperor\nNapoleon.” They felt that they were called upon to eradicate\nthe adherents of the so-called “French ideas” just as Philip II\nhad only followed the voice of his conscience when he burned\nProtestants or hanged Moors. In the beginning of the sixteenth\ncentury a man who did not believe in the divine right\nof the Pope to rule his subjects as he saw fit was a “heretic\"\nand it was the duty of all loyal citizens to kill him. In the\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, on the continent of Europe,\na man who did not believe in the divine right of his king to\nrule him as he or his Prime Minister saw fit, was a “heretic,” and\nit was the duty of all loyal citizens to denounce him to the nearest\npoliceman and see that he got punished.",
        "But the rulers of the year 1815 had learned efficiency in\nthe school of Napoleon and they performed their task much\nbetter than it had been done in the year 1517. The period\nbetween the year 1815 and the year 1860 was the great era of\nthe political spy. Spies were everywhere. They lived in palaces\nand they were to be found in the lowest gin-shops. They\npeeped through the key-holes of the ministerial cabinet and\nthey listened to the conversations of the people who were taking\nthe air on the benches of the Municipal Park. They guarded\nthe frontier so that no one might leave without a duly viseed\npassport and they inspected all packages, that no books with\ndangerous “French ideas” should enter the realm of their\nRoyal masters. They sat among the students in the lecture\nhall and woe to the Professor who uttered a word against the\nexisting order of things. They followed the little boys and\ngirls on their way to church lest they play hookey.",
        "In many of these tasks they were assisted by the clergy.\nThe church had suffered greatly during the days of the\nrevolution. The church property had been confiscated. Several\npriests had been killed and the generation that had learned its\ncathechism from Voltaire and Rousseau and the other French\nphilosophers had danced around the Altar of Reason when\nthe Committee of Public Safety had abolished the worship of\nGod in October of the year 1793. The priests had followed the\n\"emigres” into their long exile. Now they returned in the\nwake of the allied armies and they set to work with a vengeance.",
        "Even the Jesuits came back in 1814 and resumed their\nformer labours of educating the young. Their order had been\na little too successful in its fight against the enemies of the\nchurch. It had established “provinces” in every part of the\nworld, to teach the natives the blessings of Christianity, but\nsoon it had developed into a regular trading company which\nwas for ever interfering with the civil authorities. During the\nreign of the Marquis de Pombal, the great reforming minister\nof Portugal, they had been driven out of the Portuguese lands\nand in the year 1773 at the request of most of the Catholic\npowers of Europe, the order had been suppressed by Pope\nClement XIV. Now they were back on the job, and preached\nthe principles of “obedience” and “love for the legitimate\ndynasty” to children whose parents had hired shopwindows that\nthey might laugh at Marie Antoinette driving to the scaffold\nwhich was to end her misery.",
        "But in the Protestant countries like Prussia, things were\nnot a whit better. The great patriotic leaders of the year 1812,\nthe poets and the writers who had preached a holy war upon the\nusurper, were now branded as dangerous “demagogues.” Their\nhouses were searched. Their letters were read. They were\nobliged to report to the police at regular intervals and give an\naccount of themselves. The Prussian drill master was let loose\nin all his fury upon the younger generation. When a party of\nstudents celebrated the tercentenary of the Reformation with\nnoisy but harmless festivities on the old Wartburg, the Prussian\nbureaucrats had visions of an imminent revolution. When\na theological student, more honest than intelligent, killed a\nRussian government spy who was operating in Germany, the\nuniversities were placed under police-supervision and professors\nwere jailed or dismissed without any form of trial.",
        "Russia, of course, was even more absurd in these anti-\nrevolutionary activities. Alexander had recovered from his attack\nof piety. He was gradually drifting toward melancholia. He\nwell knew his own limited abilities and understood how at\nVienna he had been the victim both of Metternich and the\nKrudener woman. More and more he turned his back upon the\nwest and became a truly Russian ruler whose interests lay in\nConstantinople, the old holy city that had been the first teacher\nof the Slavs. The older he grew, the harder he worked and the\nless he was able to accomplish. And while he sat in his study,\nhis ministers turned the whole of Russia into a land of military\nbarracks.",
        "It is not a pretty picture. Perhaps I might have shortened\nthis description of the Great Reaction. But it is just as well\nthat you should have a thorough knowledge of this era. It was\nnot the first time that an attempt had been made to set the\nclock of history back. The result was the usual one.",
        "THE LOVE OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE,\nHOWEVER WAS TOO STRONG TO BE\nDESTROYED IN THIS WAY. THE SOUTH\nAMERICANS WERE THE FIRST TO REBEL\nAGAINST THE REACTIONARY MEASURES\nOF THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA, GREECE\nAND BELGIUM AND SPAIN AND A LARGE\nNUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE\nEUROPEAN CONTINENT FOLLOWED SUIT\nAND THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WAS\nFILLED WITH THE RUMOUR OF MANY\nWARS OF INDEPENDENCE",
        "IT will serve no good purpose to say “if only the Congress\nof Vienna had done such and such a thing instead of taking\nsuch and such a course, the history of Europe in the nineteenth\ncentury would have been different.” The Congress of Vienna\nwas a gathering of men who had just passed through a great\nrevolution and through twenty years of terrible and almost\ncontinuous warfare. They came together for the purpose of\ngiving Europe that “peace and stability” which they thought\nthat the people needed and wanted. They were what we call\nreactionaries. They sincerely believed in the inability of the\nmass of the people to rule themselves. They re-arranged the\nmap of Europe in such a way as seemed to promise the greatest\npossibility of a lasting success. They failed, but not through\nany premeditated wickedness on their part. They were, for the\ngreater part, men of the old school who remembered the happier\ndays of their quiet youth and ardently wished a return of that\nblessed period. They failed to recognise the strong hold which\nmany of the revolutionary principles had gained upon the people\nof the European continent. That was a misfortune but\nhardly a sin. But one of the things which the French Revolution\nhad taught not only Europe but America as well, was the\nright of people to their own “nationality.”",
        "Napoleon, who respected nothing and nobody, was utterly\nruthless in his dealing with national and patriotic aspirations.\nBut the early revolutionary generals had proclaimed the new\ndoctrine that “nationality was not a matter of political\nfrontiers or round skulls and broad noses, but a matter of the\nheart and soul.” While they were teaching the French children\nthe greatness of the French nation, they encouraged Spaniards\nand Hollanders and Italians to do the same thing. Soon\nthese people, who all shared Rousseau’s belief in the superior\nvirtues of Original Man, began to dig into their past and found,\nburied beneath the ruins of the feudal system, the bones of the\nmighty races of which they supposed themselves the feeble\ndescendants.",
        "The first half of the nineteenth century was the era of the\ngreat historical discoveries. Everywhere historians were busy\npublishing mediaeval charters and early mediaeval chronicles\nand in every country the result was a new pride in the old\nfatherland. A great deal of this sentiment was based upon the\nwrong interpretation of historical facts. But in practical politics,\nit does not matter what is true, but everything depends\nupon what the people believe to be true. And in most countries\nboth the kings and their subjects firmly believed in the glory\nand fame of their ancestors.",
        "The Congress of Vienna was not inclined to be sentimental.\nTheir Excellencies divided the map of Europe according to the\nbest interests of half a dozen dynasties and put “national\naspirations” upon the Index, or list of forbidden books, together\nwith all other dangerous “French doctrines.”",
        "But history is no respecter of Congresses. For some reason\nor other (it may be an historical law, which thus far has\nescaped the attention of the scholars) “nations” seemed to be\nnecessary for the orderly development of human society and\nthe attempt to stem this tide was quite as unsuccessful as the\nMetternichian effort to prevent people from thinking.",
        "Curiously enough the first trouble began in a very distant\npart of the world, in South America. The Spanish colonies\nof that continent had been enjoying a period of relative independence\nduring the many years of the great Napoleonic wars.\nThey had even remained faithful to their king when he was\ntaken prisoner by the French Emperor and they had refused\nto recognise Joseph Bonaparte, who had in the year 1808 been\nmade King of Spain by order of his brother.",
        "Indeed, the only part of America to get very much upset\nby the Revolution was the island of Haiti, the Espagnola of\nColumbus’ first trip. Here in the year 1791 the French Convention,\nin a sudden outburst of love and human brotherhood,\nhad bestowed upon their black brethren all the privileges hitherto\nenjoyed by their white masters. Just as suddenly they had\nrepented of this step, but the attempt to undo the original\npromise led to many years of terrible warfare between General\nLeclerc, the brother-in-law of Napoleon, and Toussaint l’Ouverture,\nthe negro chieftain. In the year 1801, Toussaint was\nasked to visit Leclerc and discuss terms of peace. He received\nthe solemn promise that he would not be molested. He trusted\nhis white adversaries, was put on board a ship and shortly\nafterwards died in a French prison. But the negroes gained\ntheir independence all the same and founded a Republic.\nIncidentally they were of great help to the first great South\nAmerican patriot in his efforts to deliver his native country\nfrom the Spanish yoke.",
        "Simon Bolivar, a native of Caracas in Venezuela, born in\nthe year 1783, had been educated in Spain, had visited Paris\nwhere he had seen the Revolutionary government at work, had\nlived for a while in the United States and had returned to his\nnative land where the widespread discontent against Spain,\nthe mother country, was beginning to take a definite form.\nIn the year 1811, Venezuela declared its independence and\nBolivar became one of the revolutionary generals. Within\ntwo months, the rebels were defeated and Bolivar fled.",
        "For the next five years he was the leader of an apparently\nlost cause. He sacrificed all his wealth and he would not have\nbeen able to begin his final and successful expedition without\nthe support of the President of Haiti. Thereafter the revolt\nspread all over South America and soon it appeared that Spain\nwas not able to suppress the rebellion unaided. She asked for\nthe support of the Holy Alliance.",
        "This step greatly worried England. The British shippers\nhad succeeded the Dutch as the Common Carriers of the world\nand they expected to reap heavy profits from a declaration of\nindependence on the part of all South America. They had\nhopes that the United States o America would interfere but\nthe Senate had no such plans and in the House, too, there were\nmany voices which declared that Spain ought to be given a\nfree hand.",
        "Just then, there was a change of ministers in England.\nThe Whigs went out and the Tories came in. George Canning\nbecame secretary of State. He dropped a hint that England\nwould gladly back up the American government with all the\nmight of her fleet, if said government would declare its\ndisapproval of the plans of the Holy Alliance in regard to the\nrebellious colonies of the southern continent. President Monroe\nthereupon, on the 2nd of December of the year 1823, addressed\nCongress and stated that: “America would consider\nany attempt on the part of the allied powers to extend their\nsystem to any portion of this western hemisphere as dangerous\nto our peace and safety,” and gave warning that “the American\ngovernment would consider such action on the part of the\nHoly Alliance as a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition\ntoward the United States.” Four weeks later, the text of the\n\"Monroe Doctrine” was printed in the English newspapers and\nthe members of the Holy Alliance were forced to make their\nchoice.",
        "Metternich hesitated. Personally he would have been willing\nto risk the displeasure of the United States (which had\nallowed both its army and navy to fall into neglect since the end\nof the Anglo-American war of the year 1812.) But Canning’s\nthreatening attitude and trouble on the continent forced him\nto be careful. The expedition never took place and South\nAmerica and Mexico gained their independence.",
        "As for the troubles on the continent of Europe, they were\ncoming fast and furious. The Holy Alliance had sent French\ntroops to Spain to act as guardians of the peace in the year\n1820. Austrian troops had been used for a similar purpose in\nItaly when the “Carbonari” (the secret society of the Charcoal\nBurners) were making propaganda for a united Italy and had\ncaused a rebellion against the unspeakable Ferdinand of\nNaples.",
        "Bad news also came from Russia where the death of Alexander\nhad been the sign for a revolutionary outbreak in St.\nPetersburg, a short but bloody upheaval, the so-called Dekaberist\nrevolt (because it took place in December,) which ended\nwith the hanging of a large number of good patriots who had\nbeen disgusted by the reaction of Alexander’s last years and\nhad tried to give Russia a constitutional form of government.",
        "But worse was to follow. Metternich had tried to assure\nhimself of the continued support of the European courts by a\nseries of conferences at Aix-la-Chapelle at Troppau at\nLaibach and finally at Verona. The delegates from the\ndifferent powers duly travelled to these agreeable watering\nplaces where the Austrian prime minister used to spend\nhis summers. They always promised to do their best\nto suppress revolt but they were none too certain of their\nsuccess. The spirit of the people was beginning to be ugly and\nespecially in France the position of the king was by no means\nsatisfactory.",
        "The real trouble however began in the Balkans, the gateway\nto western Europe through which the invaders of that\ncontinent had passed since the beginning of time. The first\noutbreak was in Moldavia, the ancient Roman province of\nDacia which had been cut off from the Empire in the third\ncentury. Since then, it had been a lost land, a sort of Atlantis,\nwhere the people had continued to speak the old Roman tongue\nand still called themselves Romans and their country Roumania.\nHere in the year 1821, a young Greek, Prince Alexander\nYpsilanti, began a revolt against the Turks. He told his followers\nthat they could count upon the support of Russia. But\nMetternich’s fast couriers were soon on their way to St Petersburg\nand the Tsar, entirely persuaded by the Austrian arguments\nin favor of “peace and stability,” refused to help. Ypsilanti\nwas forced to flee to Austria where he spent the next seven\nyears in prison.",
        "In the same year, 1821, trouble began in Greece. Since\n1815 a secret society of Greek patriots had been preparing\nthe way for a revolt. Suddenly they hoisted the flag of\nindependence in the Morea (the ancient Peloponnesus) and drove\nthe Turkish garrisons away. The Turks answered in the usual\nfashion. They took the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople,\nwho was regarded as their Pope both by the Greeks and by\nmany Russians, and they hanged him on Easter Sunday of the\nyear 1821, together with a number of his bishops. The Greeks\ncame back with a massacre of all the Mohammedans in\nTripolitsa, the capital of the Morea and the Turks retaliated\nby an attack upon the island of Chios, where they murdered\n25,000 Christians and sold 45,000 others as slaves into Asia and\nEgypt.",
        "Then the Greeks appealed to the European courts, but\nMetternich told them in so many words that they could “stew\nin their own grease,” (I am not trying to make a pun, but I\nam quoting His Serene Highness who informed the Tsar that\nthis “fire of revolt ought to burn itself out beyond the pale\nof civilisation) and the frontiers were closed to those volunteers\nwho wished to go to the rescue of the patriotic Hellenes.\nTheir cause seemed lost. At the request of Turkey, an Egyptian\narmy was landed in the Morea and soon the Turkish flag\nwas again flying from the Acropolis, the ancient stronghold of\nAthens. The Egyptian army then pacified the country “a la\nTurque,” and Metternich followed the proceedings with quiet\ninterest, awaiting the day when this “attempt against the peace\nof Europe” should be a thing of the past.",
        "Once more it was England which upset his plans. The\ngreatest glory of England does not lie in her vast colonial\npossessions, in her wealth or her navy, but in the quiet heroism\nand independence of her average citizen. The Englishman\nobeys the law because he knows that respect for the rights of\nothers marks the difference between a dog-kennel and civilised\nsociety. But he does not recognize the right of others to interfere\nwith his freedom of thought. If his country does something\nwhich he believes to be wrong, he gets up and says so\nand the government which he attacks will respect him and will\ngive him full protection against the mob which to-day, as in\nthe time of Socrates, often loves to destroy those who surpass\nit in courage or intelligence. There never has been a good\ncause, however unpopular or however distant, which has not\ncounted a number of Englishmen among its staunchest adherents.\nThe mass of the English people are not different from\nthose in other lands. They stick to the business at hand and\nhave no time for unpractical “sporting ventures.” But they\nrather admire their eccentric neighbour who drops everything\nto go and fight for some obscure people in Asia or Africa and\nwhen he has been killed they give him a fine public funeral and\nhold him up to their children as an example of valor and chivalry.",
        "Even the police spies of the Holy Alliance were powerless\nagainst this national characteristic. In the year 1824, Lord\nByron, a rich young Englishman who wrote the poetry over\nwhich all Europe wept, hoisted the sails of his yacht and started\nsouth to help the Greeks. Three months later the news spread\nthrough Europe that their hero lay dead in Missolonghi,\nthe last of the Greek strongholds. His lonely death\ncaught the imagination of the people. In all countries, societies\nwere formed to help the Greeks. Lafayette, the grand old\nman of the American revolution, pleaded their cause in France.\nThe king of Bavaria sent hundreds of his officers. Money and\nsupplies poured in upon the starving men of Missolonghi.",
        "In England, George Canning, who had defeated the plans\nof the Holy Alliance in South America, was now prime minis-\nter. He saw his chance to checkmate Metternich for a second\ntime. The English and Russian fleets were already in the\nMediterranean. They were sent by governments which dared\nno longer suppress the popular enthusiasm for the cause of the\nGreek patriots. The French navy appeared because France,\nsince the end of the Crusades, had assumed the role of the\ndefender of the Christian faith in Mohammedan lands. On October\n20 of the year 1827, the ships of the three nations attacked\nthe Turkish fleet in the bay of Navarino and destroyed it.\nRarely has the news of a battle been received with such general\nrejoicing. The people of western Europe and Russia who\nenjoyed no freedom at home consoled themselves by fighting\nan imaginary war of liberty on behalf of the oppressed Greeks.\nIn the year 1829 they had their reward. Greece became an\nindependent nation and the policy of reaction and stability\nsuffered its second great defeat.",
        "It would be absurd were I to try, in this short volume, to\ngive you a detailed account of the struggle for national\nindependence in all other countries. There are a large number of\nexcellent books devoted to such subjects. I have described the\nstruggle for the independence of Greece because it was the first\nsuccessful attack upon the bulwark of reaction which the Congress\nof Vienna had erected to “maintain the stability of Europe.\"\nThat mighty fortress of suppression still held out and\nMetternich continued to be in command. But the end was\nnear.",
        "In France the Bourbons had established an almost unbearable\nrule of police officials who were trying to undo the work\nof the French revolution, with an absolute disregard of the\nregulations and laws of civilised warfare. When Louis\nXVIII died in the year 1824, the people had enjoyed nine\nyears of “peace” which had proved even more unhappy than\nthe ten years of war of the Empire. Louis was succeeded by\nhis brother, Charles X.",
        "Louis had belonged to that famous Bourbon family which,\nalthough it never learned anything, never forgot anything.\nThe recollection of that morning in the town of Hamm, when\nnews had reached him of the decapitation of his brother,\nremained a constant warning of what might happen to those\nkings who did not read the signs of the times aright. Charles,\non the other hand, who had managed to run up private debts of\nfifty million francs before he was twenty years of age, knew\nnothing, remembered nothing and firmly intended to learn\nnothing. As soon as he had succeeded his brother, he established\na government “by priests, through priests and for\npriests,” and while the Duke of Wellington, who made this remark,\ncannot be called a violent liberal, Charles ruled in such\na way that he disgusted even that trusted friend of law and\norder. When he tried to suppress the newspapers which dared\nto criticise his government, and dismissed the Parliament because\nit supported the Press, his days were numbered.",
        "On the night of the 27th of July of the year 1830, a revolution\ntook place in Paris. On the 30th of the same month, the\nking fled to the coast and set sail for England. In this way\nthe “famous farce of fifteen years” came to an end and the\nBourbons were at last removed from the throne of France.\nThey were too hopelessly incompetent. France then might\nhave returned to a Republican form of government, but such\na step would not have been tolerated by Metternich.",
        "The situation was dangerous enough. The spark of rebellion\nhad leaped beyond the French frontier and had set fire to\nanother powder house filled with national grievances. The new\nkingdom of the Netherlands had not been a success. The Belgian\nand the Dutch people had nothing in common and their\nking, William of Orange (the descendant of an uncle of William\nthe Silent), while a hard worker and a good business man,\nwas too much lacking in tact and pliability to keep the peace\namong his uncongenial subjects. Besides, the horde of priests\nwhich had descended upon France, had at once found its way\ninto Belgium and whatever Protestant William tried to do was\nhowled down by large crowds of excited citizens as a fresh attempt\nupon the “freedom of the Catholic church.” On the 25th\nof August there was a popular outbreak against the Dutch\nauthorities in Brussels. Two months later, the Belgians\ndeclared themselves independent and elected Leopold of Coburg,\nthe uncle of Queen Victoria of England, to the throne.\nThat was an excellent solution of the difficulty. The two\ncountries, which never ought to have been united, parted their\nways and thereafter lived in peace and harmony and behaved\nlike decent neighbours.",
        "News in those days when there were only a few short railroads,\ntravelled slowly, but when the success of the French\nand the Belgian revolutionists became known in Poland there\nwas an immediate clash between the Poles and their Russian\nrulers which led to a year of terrible warfare and ended with a\ncomplete victory for the Russians who “established order along\nthe banks of the Vistula” in the well-known Russian fashion\nNicholas the first, who had succeeded his brother Alexander in\n1825, firmly believed in the Divine Right of his own family,\nand the thousands of Polish refugees who had found shelter\nin western Europe bore witness to the fact that the principles\nof the Holy Alliance were still more than a hollow phrase in\nHoly Russia.",
        "In Italy too there was a moment of unrest. Marie Louise\nDuchess of Parma and wife of the former Emperor Napoleon,\nwhom she had deserted after the defeat of Waterloo, was\ndriven away from her country, and in the Papal state the\nexasperated people tried to establish an independent Republic.\nBut the armies of Austria marched to Rome and soon every\nthing was as of old. Metternich continued to reside at the Ball\nPlatz, the home of the foreign minister of the Habsburg\ndynasty, the police spies returned to their job, and peace\nreigned supreme. Eighteen more years were to pass before a\nsecond and more successful attempt could be made to deliver\nEurope from the terrible inheritance of the Vienna Congress.",
        "Again it was France, the revolutionary weather-cock of\nEurope, which gave the signal of revolt. Charles X had been\nsucceeded by Louis Philippe, the son of that famous Duke of\nOrleans who had turned Jacobin, had voted for the death of his\ncousin the king, and had played a role during the early days\nof the revolution under the name of “Philippe Egalite” or\n\"Equality Philip.” Eventually he had been killed when\nRobespierre tried to purge the nation of all “traitors,” (by\nwhich name he indicated those people who did not share his own\nviews) and his son had been forced to run away from the\nrevolutionary army. Young Louis Philippe thereupon had\nwandered far and wide. He had taught school in Switzerland\nand had spent a couple of years exploring the unknown “far\nwest” of America. After the fall of Napoleon he had returned\nto Paris. He was much more intelligent than his Bourbon\ncousins. He was a simple man who went about in the public\nparks with a red cotton umbrella under his arm, followed by a\nbrood of children like any good housefather. But France had\noutgrown the king business and Louis did not know this until\nthe morning of the 24th of February, of the year 1848, when\na crowd stormed the Tuilleries and drove his Majesty away and\nproclaimed the Republic.",
        "When the news of this event reached Vienna, Metternich\nexpressed the casual opinion that this was only a repetition\nof the year 1793 and that the Allies would once more be obliged\nto march upon Paris and make an end to this very unseemly\ndemocratic row. But two weeks later his own Austrian capital\nwas in open revolt. Metternich escaped from the mob through\nthe back door of his palace, and the Emperor Ferdinand was\nforced to give his subjects a constitution which embodied most\nof the revolutionary principles which his Prime Minister had\ntried to suppress for the last thirty-three years.",
        "This time all Europe felt the shock. Hungary declared itself\nindependent, and commenced a war against the Habsburgs\nunder the leadership of Louis Kossuth. The unequal\nstruggle lasted more than a year. It was finally suppressed by\nthe armies of Tsar Nicholas who marched across the Carpathian\nmountains and made Hungary once more safe for autocracy.\nThe Habsburgs thereupon established extraordinary\ncourt-martials and hanged the greater part of the Hungarian\npatriots whom they had not been able to defeat in open battle.",
        "As for Italy, the island of Sicily declared itself independent\nfrom Naples and drove its Bourbon king away. In the Papal\nstates the prime minister, Rossi, was murdered and the Pope\nwas forced to flee. He returned the next year at the head of a\nFrench army which remained in Rome to protect His Holiness\nagainst his subjects until the year 1870. Then it was\ncalled back to defend France against the Prussians, and\nRome became the capital of Italy. In the north, Milan and\nVenice rose against their Austrian masters. They were supported\nby king Albert of Sardinia, but a strong Austrian army\nunder old Radetzky marched into the valley of the Po, defeated\nthe Sardinians near Custozza and Novara and forced\nAlbert to abdicate in favour of his son, Victor Emanuel, who\na few years later was to be the first king of a united Italy.",
        "In Germany the unrest of the year 1848 took the form of a\ngreat national demonstration in favour of political unity and a\nrepresentative form of government. In Bavaria, the king who\nhad wasted his time and money upon an Irish lady who posed as\na Spanish dancer–(she was called Lola Montez and lies buried\nin New York’s Potter’s Field)–was driven away by the enraged\nstudents of the university. In Prussia, the king was\nforced to stand with uncovered head before the coffins of those\nwho had been killed during the street fighting and to promise a\nconstitutional form of government. And in March of the year\n1849, a German parliament, consisting of 550 delegates from\nall parts of the country came together in Frankfort and proposed\nthat king Frederick William of Prussia should be the\nEmperor of a United Germany.",
        "Then, however, the tide began to turn. Incompetent Ferdinand\nhad abdicated in favour of his nephew Francis Joseph.\nThe well-drilled Austrian army had remained faithful to their\nwar-lord. The hangman was given plenty of work and the\nHabsburgs, after the nature of that strangely cat-like family,\nonce more landed upon their feet and rapidly strengthened\ntheir position as the masters of eastern and western Europe.\nThey played the game of politics very adroitly and used the\njealousies of the other German states to prevent the elevation\nof the Prussian king to the Imperial dignity. Their long train-\ning in the art of suffering defeat had taught them the value of\npatience. They knew how to wait. They bided their time\nand while the liberals, utterly untrained in practical politics,\ntalked and talked and talked and got intoxicated by their own\nfine speeches, the Austrians quietly gathered their forces, dismissed\nthe Parliament of Frankfort and re-established the old\nand impossible German confederation which the Congress of\nVienna had wished upon an unsuspecting world.",
        "But among the men who had attended this strange Parliament\nof unpractical enthusiasts, there was a Prussian country\nsquire by the name of Bismarck, who had made good use of his\neyes and ears. He had a deep contempt for oratory. He knew\n(what every man of action has always known) that nothing\nis ever accomplished by talk. In his own way he was a sincere\npatriot. He had been trained in the old school of diplomacy\nand he could outlie his opponents just as he could outwalk\nthem and outdrink them and outride them.",
        "Bismarck felt convinced that the loose confederation\nof little states must be changed into a strong united country\nif it would hold its own against the other European powers.\nBrought up amidst feudal ideas of loyalty, he decided that\nthe house of Hohenzollern, of which he was the most faithful\nservant, should rule the new state, rather than the incompetent\nHabsburgs. For this purpose he must first get rid of the\nAustrian influence, and he began to make the necessary\npreparations for this painful operation.",
        "Italy in the meantime had solved her own problem, and had\nrid herself of her hated Austrian master. The unity of Italy\nwas the work of three men, Cavour, Mazzini and Garibaldi.\nOf these three, Cavour, the civil-engineer with the short-sighted\neyes and the steel-rimmed glasses, played the part of the careful\npolitical pilot. Mazzini, who had spent most of his days\nin different European garrets, hiding from the Austrian police,\nwas the public agitator, while Garibaldi, with his band of red-\nshirted rough-riders, appealed to the popular imagination.",
        "Mazzini and Garibaldi were both believers in the Republican\nform of government. Cavour, however, was a monarch-\nist, and the others who recognised his superior ability in such\nmatters of practical statecraft, accepted his decision and sacrificed\ntheir own ambitions for the greater good of their beloved\nFatherland.",
        "Cavour felt towards the House of Sardinia as Bismarck\ndid towards the Hohenzollern family. With infinite care and\ngreat shrewdness he set to work to jockey the Sardinian King\ninto a position from which His Majesty would be able to assume\nthe leadership of the entire Italian people. The unsettled\npolitical conditions in the rest of Europe greatly helped him in\nhis plans and no country contributed more to the independence\nof Italy than her old and trusted (and often distrusted)\nneighbour, France.",
        "In that turbulent country, in November of the year 1852,\nthe Republic had come to a sudden but not unexpected end.\nNapoleon III the son of Louis Bonaparte the former King of\nHolland, and the small nephew of a great uncle, had re-\nestablished an Empire and had made himself Emperor “by the\nGrace of God and the Will of the People.”",
        "This young man, who had been educated in Germany and\nwho mixed his French with harsh Teutonic gutturals (just\nas the first Napoleon had always spoken the language of his\nadopted country with a strong Italian accent) was trying very\nhard to use the Napoleonic tradition for his own benefit. But\nhe had many enemies and did not feel very certain of his hold\nupon his ready-made throne. He had gained the friendship\nof Queen Victoria but this had not been a difficult task, as the\ngood Queen was not particularly brilliant and was very susceptible\nto flattery. As for the other European sovereigns,\nthey treated the French Emperor with insulting haughtiness\nand sat up nights devising new ways in which they could show\ntheir upstart “Good Brother” how sincerely they despised him.",
        "Napoleon was obliged to find a way in which he could break\nthis opposition, either through love or through fear. He well\nknew the fascination which the word “glory” still held for his\nsubjects. Since he was forced to gamble for his throne he\ndecided to play the game of Empire for high stakes. He used\nan attack of Russia upon Turkey as an excuse for bringing\nabout the Crimean war in which England and France combined\nagainst the Tsar on behalf of the Sultan. It was a very\ncostly and exceedingly unprofitable enterprise. Neither\nFrance nor England nor Russia reaped much glory.",
        "But the Crimean war did one good thing. It gave Sardinia\na chance to volunteer on the winning side and when peace was\ndeclared it gave Cavour the opportunity to lay claim to the\ngratitude of both England and France.",
        "Having made use of the international situation to get Sardinia\nrecognised as one of the more important powers of Europe,\nthe clever Italian then provoked a war between Sardinia\nand Austria in June of the year 1859. He assured himself of\nthe support of Napoleon in exchange for the provinces of\nSavoy and the city of Nice, which was really an Italian town.\nThe Franco-Italian armies defeated the Austrians at Magenta\nand Solferino, and the former Austrian provinces and duchies\nwere united into a single Italian kingdom. Florence became\nthe capital of this new Italy until the year 1870 when the\nFrench recalled their troops from Home to defend France\nagainst the Germans. As soon as they were gone, the Italian\ntroops entered the eternal city and the House of Sardinia took\nup its residence in the old Palace of the Quirinal which an\nancient Pope had built on the ruins of the baths of the Emperor\nConstantine.",
        "The Pope, however, moved across the river Tiber and hid\nbehind the walls of the Vatican, which had been the home of\nmany of his predecessors since their return from the exile of\nAvignon in the year 1377. He protested loudly against this\nhigh-handed theft of his domains and addressed letters of appeal\nto those faithful Catholics who were inclined to sympathise\nwith him in his loss. Their number, however, was small,\nand it has been steadily decreasing. For, once delivered from\nthe cares of state, the Pope was able to devote all his time to\nquestions of a spiritual nature. Standing high above the petty\nquarrels of the European politicians, the Papacy assumed a new\ndignity which proved of great benefit to the church and made\nit an international power for social and religious progress\nwhich has shown a much more intelligent appreciation of modern\neconomic problems than most Protestant sects.",
        "In this way, the attempt of the Congress of Vienna to\nsettle the Italian question by making the peninsula an\nAustrian province was at last undone.",
        "The German problem however remained as yet unsolved.\nIt proved the most difficult of all. The failure of the revolution\nof the year 1848 had led to the wholesale migration of the more\nenergetic and liberal elements among the German people.\nThese young fellows had moved to the United States of America,\nto Brazil, to the new colonies in Asia and America. Their\nwork was continued in Germany but by a different sort of men.",
        "In the new Diet which met at Frankfort, after the collapse\nof the German Parliament and the failure of the Liberals to\nestablish a united country, the Kingdom of Prussia was represented\nby that same Otto von Bismarck from whom we parted\na few pages ago. Bismarck by now had managed to gain the\ncomplete confidence of the king of Prussia. That was all he\nasked for. The opinion of the Prussian parliament or of the\nPrussian people interested him not at all. With his own eyes\nhe had seen the defeat of the Liberals. He knew that he\nwould not be able to get rid of Austria without a war and he\nbegan by strengthening the Prussian army. The Landtag, exasperated\nat his high-handed methods, refused to give him the\nnecessary credits. Bismarck did not even bother to discuss\nthe matter. He went ahead and increased his army with the\nhelp of funds which the Prussian house of Peers and the king\nplaced at his disposal. Then he looked for a national cause\nwhich could be used for the purpose of creating a great wave\nof patriotism among all the German people.",
        "In the north of Germany there were the Duchies of Schleswig\nand Holstein which ever since the middle ages had been a\nsource of trouble. Both countries were inhabited by a certain\nnumber of Danes and a certain number of Germans, but although\nthey were governed by the King of Denmark, they\nwere not an integral part of the Danish State and this led to\nendless difficulties. Heaven forbid that I should revive this\nforgotten question which now seems settled by the acts of the\nrecent Congress of Versailles. But the Germans in Holstein\nwere very loud in their abuse of the Danes and the Danes in\nSchleswig made a great ado of their Danishness, and all Europe\nwas discussing the problem and German Mannerchors\nand Turnvereins listened to sentimental speeches about the\n\"lost brethren” and the different chancelleries were trying to\ndiscover what it was all about, when Prussia mobilised her\narmies to “save the lost provinces.” As Austria, the official\nhead of the German Confederation, could not allow Prussia\nto act alone in such an important matter, the Habsburg troops\nwere mobilised too and the combined armies of the two great\npowers crossed the Danish frontiers and after a very brave\nresistance on the part of the Danes, occupied the two duchies.\nThe Danes appealed to Europe, but Europe was otherwise\nengaged and the poor Danes were left to their fate.",
        "Bismarck then prepared the scene for the second number\nupon his Imperial programme. He used the division of the\nspoils to pick a quarrel with Austria. The Habsburgs fell into\nthe trap. The new Prussian army, the creation of Bismarck and\nhis faithful generals, invaded Bohemia and in less than six\nweeks, the last of the Austrian troops had been destroyed at\nKoniggratz and Sadowa and the road to Vienna lay open. But\nBismarck did not want to go too far. He knew that he would\nneed a few friends in Europe. He offered the defeated\nHabsburgs very decent terms of peace, provided they would\nresign their chairmanship of the Confederation. He was less\nmerciful to many of the smaller German states who had taken\nthe side of the Austrians, and annexed them to Prussia. The\ngreater part of the northern states then formed a new organisation,\nthe so-called North German Confederacy, and victorious\nPrussia assumed the unofficial leadership of the German\npeople.",
        "Europe stood aghast at the rapidity with which the work of\nconsolidation had been done. England was quite indifferent\nbut France showed signs of disapproval. Napoleon’s hold\nupon the French people was steadily diminishing. The Crimean\nwar had been costly and had accomplished nothing.",
        "A second adventure in the year 1863, when a French army\nhad tried to force an Austrian Grand-Duke by the name of\nMaximilian upon the Mexican people as their Emperor, had\ncome to a disastrous end as soon as the American Civil War had\nbeen won by the North. For the Government at Washington\nhad forced the French to withdraw their troops and this had\ngiven the Mexicans a chance to clear their country of the enemy\nand shoot the unwelcome Emperor.",
        "It was necessary to give the Napoleonic throne a new\ncoat of glory-paint. Within a few years the North German\nConfederation would be a serious rival of France. Napoleon\ndecided that a war with Germany would be a good thing for his\ndynasty. He looked for an excuse and Spain, the poor victim\nof endless revolutions, gave him one.",
        "Just then the Spanish throne happened to be vacant. It\nhad been offered to the Catholic branch of the house of Hohenzollern.\nThe French government had objected and the Hohenzollerns\nhad politely refused to accept the crown. But\nNapoleon, who was showing signs of illness, was very much\nunder the influence of his beautiful wife, Eugenie de Montijo,\nthe daughter of a Spanish gentleman and the grand-daughter\nof William Kirkpatrick, an American consul at Malaga, where\nthe grapes come from. Eugenie, although shrewd enough, was\nas badly educated as most Spanish women of that day. She\nwas at the mercy of her spiritual advisers and these worthy\ngentlemen felt no love for the Protestant King of Prussia. “Be\nbold,” was the advice of the Empress to her husband, but she\nomitted to add the second half of that famous Persian proverb\nwhich admonishes the hero to “be bold but not too bold.\"\nNapoleon, convinced of the strength of his army, addressed\nhimself to the king of Prussia and insisted that the king give\nhim assurances that “he would never permit another candidature\nof a Hohenzollern prince to the Spanish crown.” As\nthe Hohenzollerns had just declined the honour, the demand\nwas superfluous, and Bismarck so informed the French government.\nBut Napoleon was not satisfied.",
        "It was the year 1870 and King William was taking the\nwaters at Ems. There one day he was approached by the\nFrench minister who tried to re-open the discussion. The king\nanswered very pleasantly that it was a fine day and that the\nSpanish question was now closed and that nothing more\nremained to be said upon the subject. As a matter of\nroutine, a report of this interview was telegraphed to\nBismarck, who handled all foreign affairs. Bismarck edited\nthe dispatch for the benefit of the Prussian and French\npress. Many people have called him names for doing\nthis. Bismarck however could plead the excuse that the doctoring\nof official news, since time immemorial, had been one\nof the privileges of all civilised governments. When the “edited\"\ntelegram was printed, the good people in Berlin felt that\ntheir old and venerable king with his nice white whiskers had\nbeen insulted by an arrogant little Frenchman and the equally\ngood people of Paris flew into a rage because their perfectly\ncourteous minister had been shown the door by a Royal Prussian\nflunkey.",
        "And so they both went to war and in less than two months,\nNapoleon and the greater part of his army were prisoners of\nthe Germans. The Second Empire had come to an end and the\nThird Republic was making ready to defend Paris against the\nGerman invaders. Paris held out for five long months. Ten\ndays before the surrender of the city, in the nearby palace of\nVersailles, built by that same King Louis XIV who had been\nsuch a dangerous enemy to the Germans, the King of Prussia\nwas publicly proclaimed German Emperor and a loud booming\nof guns told the hungry Parisians that a new German Empire\nhad taken the place of the old harmless Confederation of Teutonic\nstates and stateless.",
        "In this rough way, the German question was finally settled.\nBy the end of the year 1871, fifty-six years after the memorable\ngathering at Vienna, the work of the Congress had been entirely\nundone. Metternich and Alexander and Talleyrand had tried\nto give the people of Europe a lasting peace. The methods\nthey had employed had caused endless wars and revolutions and\nthe feeling of a common brotherhood of the eighteenth century\nwas followed by an era of exaggerated nationalism which has\nnot yet come to an end.",
        "BUT WHILE THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE WERE\nFIGHTING FOR THEIR NATIONAL\nINDEPENDENCE, THE WORLD IN WHICH THEY\nLIVED HAD BEEN ENTIRELY CHANGED\nBY A SERIES OF INVENTIONS, WHICH HAD\nMADE THE CLUMSY OLD STEAM ENGINE\nOF THE 18TH CENTURY THE MOST FAITHFUL\nAND EFFICIENT SLAVE OF MAN",
        "THE greatest benefactor of the human race died more than\nhalf a million years ago. He was a hairy creature with a low\nbrow and sunken eyes, a heavy jaw and strong tiger-like teeth.\nHe would not have looked well in a gathering of modern scientists,\nbut they would have honoured him as their master. For\nhe had used a stone to break a nut and a stick to lift up a heavy\nboulder. He was the inventor of the hammer and the lever, our\nfirst tools, and he did more than any human being who came\nafter him to give man his enormous advantage over the other\nanimals with whom he shares this planet.",
        "Ever since, man has tried to make his life easier by the use\nof a greater number of tools. The first wheel (a round disc\nmade out of an old tree) created as much stir in the communities\nof 100,000 B.C. as the flying machine did only a few years\nago.",
        "In Washington, the story is told of a director of the Patent\nOffice who in the early thirties of the last century suggested\nthat the Patent Office be abolished, because “everything that\npossibly could be invented had been invented.” A similar\nfeeling must have spread through the prehistoric world when\nthe first sail was hoisted on a raft and the people were able\nto move from place to place without rowing or punting or\npulling from the shore.",
        "Indeed one of the most interesting chapters of history is\nthe effort of man to let some one else or something else do his\nwork for him, while he enjoyed his leisure, sitting in the sun\nor painting pictures on rocks, or training young wolves and\nlittle tigers to behave like peaceful domestic animals.",
        "Of course in the very olden days; it was always possible\nto enslave a weaker neighbour and force him to do the unpleasant\ntasks of life. One of the reasons why the Greeks and\nRomans, who were quite as intelligent as we are, failed to\ndevise more interesting machinery, was to be found in the wide-\nspread existence of slavery. Why should a great mathematician\nwaste his time upon wires and pulleys and cogs and fill\nthe air with noise and smoke when he could go to the marketplace\nand buy all the slaves he needed at a very small expense?",
        "And during the middle-ages, although slavery had been\nabolished and only a mild form of serfdom survived, the guilds\ndiscouraged the idea of using machinery because they thought\nthis would throw a large number of their brethren out of\nwork. Besides, the Middle-Ages were not at all interested\nin producing large quantities of goods. Their tailors and butchers\nand carpenters worked for the immediate needs of the small\ncommunity in which they lived and had no desire to compete\nwith their neighbours, or to produce more than was strictly\nnecessary.",
        "During the Renaissance, when the prejudices of the Church\nagainst scientific investigations could no longer be enforced as\nrigidly as before, a large number of men began to devote their\nlives to mathematics and astronomy and physics and chemistry.\nTwo years before the beginning of the Thirty Years War,\nJohn Napier, a Scotchman, had published his little book which\ndescribed the new invention of logarithms. During the war it-\nself, Gottfried Leibnitz of Leipzig had perfected the system of\ninfinitesimal calculus. Eight years before the peace of Westphalia,\nNewton, the great English natural philosopher, was\nborn, and in that same year Galileo, the Italian astronomer,\ndied. Meanwhile the Thirty Years War had destroyed the prosperity\nof central Europe and there was a sudden but very general\ninterest in “alchemy,” the strange pseudo-science of the\nmiddle-ages by which people hoped to turn base metals into\ngold. This proved to be impossible but the alchemists in their\nlaboratories stumbled upon many new ideas and greatly helped\nthe work of the chemists who were their successors.",
        "The work of all these men provided the world with a solid\nscientific foundation upon which it was possible to build even\nthe most complicated of engines, and a number of practical\nmen made good use of it. The Middle-Ages had used wood for\nthe few bits of necessary machinery. But wood wore out\neasily. Iron was a much better material but iron was scarce\nexcept in England. In England therefore most of the smelting\nwas done. To smelt iron, huge fires were needed. In the\nbeginning, these fires had been made of wood, but gradually\nthe forests had been used up. Then “stone coal” (the petrified\ntrees of prehistoric times) was used. But coal as you\nknow has to be dug out of the ground and it has to be transported\nto the smelting ovens and the mines have to be kept\ndry from the ever invading waters.",
        "These were two problems which had to be solved at once.\nFor the time being, horses could still be used to haul the coal-\nwagons, but the pumping question demanded the application\nof special machinery. Several inventors were busy trying to\nsolve the difficulty. They all knew that steam would have to\nbe used in their new engine. The idea of the steam engine was\nvery old. Hero of Alexandria, who lived in the first century\nbefore Christ, has described to us several bits of machinery\nwhich were driven by steam. The people of the Renaissance\nhad played with the notion of steam-driven war chariots. The\nMarquis of Worcester, a contemporary of Newton, in his book\nof inventions, tells of a steam engine. A little later, in the year\n1698, Thomas Savery of London applied for a patent for a\npumping engine. At the same time, a Hollander, Christian\nHuygens, was trying to perfect an engine in which gun-powder\nwas used to cause regular explosions in much the same way as\nwe use gasoline in our motors.",
        "All over Europe, people were busy with the idea. Denis\nPapin, a Frenchman, friend and assistant of Huygens, was\nmaking experiments with steam engines in several countries.\nHe invented a little wagon that was driven by steam, and a\npaddle-wheel boat. But when he tried to take a trip in his\nvessel, it was confiscated by the authorities on a complaint of\nthe boatmen’s union, who feared that such a craft would deprive\nthem of their livelihood. Papin finally died in London in\ngreat poverty, having wasted all his money on his inventions.\nBut at the time of his death, another mechanical enthusiast,\nThomas Newcomen, was working on the problem of a new\nsteam-pump. Fifty years later his engine was improved upon\nby James Watt, a Glasgow instrument maker. In the year\n1777, he gave the world the first steam engine that proved of\nreal practical value.",
        "But during the centuries of experiments with a “heat-engine,\"\nthe political world had greatly changed. The British\npeople had succeeded the Dutch as the common-carriers of the\nworld’s trade. They had opened up new colonies. They took\nthe raw materials which the colonies produced to England,\nand there they turned them into finished products, and then\nthey exported the finished goods to the four corners of the\nworld. During the seventeenth century, the people of Georgia\nand the Carolinas had begun to grow a new shrub which gave\na strange sort of woolly substance, the so-called “cotton wool.\"\nAfter this had been plucked, it was sent to England and there\nthe people of Lancastershire wove it into cloth. This weaving\nwas done by hand and in the homes of the workmen. Very soon\na number of improvements were made in the process of weaving.\nIn the year 1730, John Kay invented the “fly shuttle.\"\nIn 1770, James Hargreaves got a patent on his “spinning\njenny.” Eli Whitney, an American, invented the cotton-gin,\nwhich separated the cotton from its seeds, a job which had\npreviously been done by hand at the rate of only a pound a day.\nFinally Richard Arkwright and the Reverend Edmund Cartwright\ninvented large weaving machines, which were driven by\nwater power. And then, in the eighties of the eighteenth\ncentury, just when the Estates General of France had begun\nthose famous meetings which were to revolutionise the political\nsystem of Europe, the engines of Watt were arranged in such\na way that they could drive the weaving machines of Arkwright,\nand this created an economic and social revolution\nwhich has changed human relationship in almost every part\nof the world.",
        "As soon as the stationary engine had proved a success, the\ninventors turned their attention to the problem of propelling\nboats and carts with the help of a mechanical contrivance.\nWatt himself designed plans for a “steam locomotive,” but\nere he had perfected his ideas, in the year 1804, a locomotive\nmade by Richard Trevithick carried a load of twenty tons at\nPen-y-darran in the Wales mining district.",
        "At the same time an American jeweller and portrait-painter\nby the name of Robert Fulton was in Paris, trying to convince\nNapoleon that with the use of his submarine boat, the\n\"Nautilus,” and his “steam-boat,” the French might be able to\ndestroy the naval supremacy of England.",
        "Fulton’s idea of a steamboat was not original. He had\nundoubtedly copied it from John Fitch, a mechanical genius of\nConnecticut whose cleverly constructed steamer had first navigated\nthe Delaware river as early as the year 1787. But Napoleon\nand his scientific advisers did not believe in the practical\npossibility of a self-propelled boat, and although the Scotch-\nbuilt engine of the little craft puffed merrily on the Seine, the\ngreat Emperor neglected to avail himself of this formidable\nweapon which might have given him his revenge for Trafalgar.",
        "As for Fulton, he returned to the United States and, being\na practical man of business, he organised a successful steamboat\ncompany together with Robert R. Livingston, a signer of\nthe Declaration of Independence, who was American Minister\nto France when Fulton was in Paris, trying to sell his invention.\nThe first steamer of this new company, the “Clermont,\"\nwhich was given a monopoly of all the waters of New York\nState, equipped with an engine built by Boulton and Watt of\nBirmingham in England, began a regular service between New\nYork and Albany in the year 1807.",
        "As for poor John Fitch, the man who long before any one\nelse had used the “steam-boat” for commercial purposes, he\ncame to a sad death. Broken in health and empty of purse, he\nhad come to the end of his resources when his fifth boat, which\nwas propelled by means of a screw-propeller, had been destroyed.\nHis neighbours jeered at him as they were to laugh a\nhundred years later when Professor Langley constructed his\nfunny flying machines. Fitch had hoped to give his country\nan easy access to the broad rivers of the west and his countrymen\npreferred to travel in flat-boats or go on foot. In the year\n1798, in utter despair and misery, Fitch killed himself by taking\npoison.",
        "But twenty years later, the “Savannah,” a steamer of 1850\ntons and making six knots an hour, (the Mauretania goes just\nfour times as fast,) crossed the ocean from Savannah to Liverpool\nin the record time of twenty-five days. Then there was\nan end to the derision of the multitude and in their enthusiasm\nthe people gave the credit for the invention to the wrong man.",
        "Six years later, George Stephenson, a Scotchman, who had\nbeen building locomotives for the purpose of hauling coal from\nthe mine-pit to smelting ovens and cotton factories, built his\nfamous “travelling engine” which reduced the price of coal by\nalmost seventy per cent and which made it possible to establish\nthe first regular passenger service between Manchester and\nLiverpool, when people were whisked from city to city at the\nunheard-of speed of fifteen miles per hour. A dozen years\nlater, this speed had been increased to twenty miles per hour.\nAt the present time, any well-behaved flivver (the direct descendant\nof the puny little motor-driven machines of Daimler\nand Levassor of the eighties of the last century) can do better\nthan these early “Puffing Billies.”",
        "But while these practically-minded engineers were improving\nupon their rattling “heat engines,” a group of “pure\"\nscientists (men who devote fourteen hours of each day to the\nstudy of those “theoretical” scientific phenomena without which\nno mechanical progress would be possible) were following a\nnew scent which promised to lead them into the most secret and\nhidden domains of Nature.",
        "Two thousand years ago, a number of Greek and Roman\nphilosophers (notably Thales of Miletus and Pliny who was\nkilled while trying to study the eruption of Vesuvius of the\nyear 79 when Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried beneath\nthe ashes) had noticed the strange antics of bits of straw and of\nfeather which were held near a piece of amber which was being\nrubbed with a bit of wool. The schoolmen of the Middle Ages\nhad not been interested in this mysterious “electric” power.\nBut immediately after the Renaissance, William Gilbert, the\nprivate physician of Queen Elizabeth, wrote his famous treatise\non the character and behaviour of Magnets. During the\nThirty Years War Otto von Guericke, the burgomaster of\nMagdeburg and the inventor of the air-pump, constructed the\nfirst electrical machine. During the next century a large number\nof scientists devoted themselves to the study of electricity.\nNot less than three professors invented the famous Leyden\nJar in the year 1795. At the same time, Benjamin Franklin,\nthe most universal genius of America next to Benjamin Thomson\n(who after his flight from New Hampshire on account of\nhis pro-British sympathies became known as Count Rumford)\nwas devoting his attention to this subject. He discovered that\nlightning and the electric spark were manifestations of the same\nelectric power and continued his electric studies until the end of\nhis busy and useful life. Then came Volta with his famous\n\"electric pile” and Galvani and Day and the Danish professor\nHans Christian Oersted and Ampere and Arago and Faraday,\nall of them diligent searchers after the true nature of the electric\nforces.",
        "They freely gave their discoveries to the world and Samuel\nMorse (who like Fulton began his career as an artist) thought\nthat he could use this new electric current to transmit messages\nfrom one city to another. He intended to use copper\nwire and a little machine which he had invented. People\nlaughed at him. Morse therefore was obliged to finance his\nown experiments and soon he had spent all his money and\nthen he was very poor and people laughed even louder. He\nthen asked Congress to help him and a special Committee on\nCommerce promised him their support. But the members of\nCongress were not at all interested and Morse had to wait\ntwelve years before he was given a small congressional appropriation.\nHe then built a “telegraph” between Baltimore and\nWashington. In the year 1887 he had shown his first successful\n\"telegraph” in one of the lecture halls of New York\nUniversity. Finally, on the 24th of May of the year 1844 the\nfirst long-distance message was sent from Washington to\nBaltimore and to-day the whole world is covered with telegraph\nwires and we can send news from Europe to Asia in a few\nseconds. Twenty-three years later Alexander Graham Bell used\nthe electric current for his telephone. And half a century\nafterwards Marconi improved upon these ideas by inventing a\nsystem of sending messages which did away entirely with the old-\nfashioned wires.",
        "While Morse, the New Englander, was working on his\n\"telegraph,” Michael Faraday, the Yorkshire-man, had constructed\nthe first “dynamo.” This tiny little machine was completed\nin the year 1881 when Europe was still trembling as a\nresult of the great July revolutions which had so severely upset\nthe plans of the Congress of Vienna. The first dynamo grew\nand grew and grew and to-day it provides us with heat and\nwith light (you know the little incandescent bulbs which Edison,\nbuilding upon French and English experiments of the forties\nand fifties, first made in 1878) and with power for all sorts\nof machines. If I am not mistaken the electric-engine will\nsoon entirely drive out the “heat engine” just as in the olden\ndays the more highly-organised prehistoric animals drove out\ntheir less efficient neighbours.",
        "Personally (but I know nothing about machinery) this will\nmake me very happy. For the electric engine which can be run\nby waterpower is a clean and companionable servant of mankind\nbut the “heat-engine,” the marvel of the eighteenth century,\nis a noisy and dirty creature for ever filling the world with\nridiculous smoke-stacks and with dust and soot and asking\nthat it be fed with coal which has to be dug out of mines at\ngreat inconvenience and risk to thousands of people.",
        "And if I were a novelist and not a historian, who must stick\nto facts and may not use his imagination, I would describe the\nhappy day when the last steam locomotive shall be taken to the\nMuseum of Natural History to be placed next to the skeleton\nof the Dynosaur and the Pteredactyl and the other extinct\ncreatures of a by-gone age.",
        "BUT THE NEW ENGINES WERE VERY\nEXPENSIVE AND ONLY PEOPLE OF WEALTH\nCOULD AFFORD THEM. THE OLD CARPENTER\nOR SHOEMAKER WHO HAD BEEN HIS\nOWN MASTER IN HIS LITTLE WORKSHOP\nWAS OBLIGED TO HIRE HIMSELF OUT TO\nTHE OWNERS OF THE BIG MECHANICAL\nTOOLS, AND WHILE HE MADE MORE\nMONEY THAN BEFORE, HE LOST HIS\nFORMER INDEPENDENCE AND HE DID NOT\nLIKE THAT",
        "IN the olden days the work of the world had been done by\nindependent workmen who sat in their own little workshops in\nthe front of their houses, who owned their tools, who boxed the\nears of their own apprentices and who, within the limits prescribed\nby their guilds, conducted their business as it pleased\nthem. They lived simple lives, and were obliged to work very\nlong hours, but they were their own masters. If they got up\nand saw that it was a fine day to go fishing, they went fishing\nand there was no one to say “no.”",
        "But the introduction of machinery changed this. A machine\nis really nothing but a greatly enlarged tool. A railroad\ntrain which carries you at the speed of a mile a minute is\nin reality a pair of very fast legs, and a steam hammer which\nflattens heavy plates of iron is just a terrible big fist, made of\nsteel.",
        "But whereas we can all afford a pair of good legs and a\ngood strong fist, a railroad train and a steam hammer and a\ncotton factory are very expensive pieces of machinery and they\nare not owned by a single man, but usually by a company of\npeople who all contribute a certain sum and then divide the\nprofits of their railroad or cotton mill according to the amount\nof money which they have invested.",
        "Therefore, when machines had been improved until they\nwere really practicable and profitable, the builders of those\nlarge tools, the machine manufacturers, began to look for customers\nwho could afford to pay for them in cash.",
        "During the early middle ages, when land had been almost\nthe only form of wealth, the nobility were the only people\nwho were considered wealthy. But as I have told you in a\nprevious chapter, the gold and silver which they possessed\nwas quite insignificant and they used the old system of barter,\nexchanging cows for horses and eggs for honey. During\nthe crusades, the burghers of the cities had been able to gather\nriches from the reviving trade between the east and the west,\nand they had been serious rivals of the lords and the knights.",
        "The French revolution had entirely destroyed the wealth\nof the nobility and had enormously increased that of the middle\nclass or “bourgeoisie.” The years of unrest which followed the\nGreat Revolution had offered many middle-class people a\nchance to get more than their share of this world’s goods. The\nestates of the church had been confiscated by the French Convention\nand had been sold at auction. There had been a terrific\namount of graft. Land speculators had stolen thousands\nof square miles of valuable land, and during the Napoleonic\nwars, they had used their capital to “profiteer” in grain and\ngun-powder, and now they possessed more wealth than they\nneeded for the actual expenses of their households, and they\ncould afford to build themselves factories and to hire men and\nwomen to work the machines.",
        "This caused a very abrupt change in the lives of hundreds\nof thousands of people. Within a few years, many cities\ndoubled the number of their inhabitants and the old civic centre\nwhich had been the real “home” of the citizens was surrounded\nwith ugly and cheaply built suburbs where the workmen slept\nafter their eleven or twelve hours, or thirteen hours, spent in the\nfactories and from where they returned to the factory as soon\nas the whistle blew.",
        "Far and wide through the countryside there was talk of the\nfabulous sums of money that could be made in the towns. The\npeasant boy, accustomed to a life in the open, went to the city.\nHe rapidly lost his old health amidst the smoke and dust and\ndirt of those early and badly ventilated workshops, and the\nend, very often, was death in the poor-house or in the hospital.",
        "Of course the change from the farm to the factory on the\npart of so many people was not accomplished without a certain\namount of opposition. Since one engine could do as much\nwork as a hundred men, the ninety-nine others who were\nthrown out of employment did not like it. Frequently they attacked\nthe factory-buildings and set fire to the machines, but\nInsurance Companies had been organised as early as the 17th\ncentury and as a rule the owners were well protected against loss.",
        "Soon, newer and better machines were installed, the factory\nwas surrounded with a high wall and then there was an\nend to the rioting. The ancient guilds could not possibly survive\nin this new world of steam and iron. They went out of\nexistence and then the workmen tried to organise regular labour\nunions. But the factory-owners, who through their wealth\ncould exercise great influence upon the politicians of the different\ncountries, went to the Legislature and had laws passed\nwhich forbade the forming of such trade unions because they\ninterfered with the “liberty of action” of the working man.",
        "Please do not think that the good members of Parliament\nwho passed these laws were wicked tyrants. They were\nthe true sons of the revolutionary period when everybody\ntalked of “liberty” and when people often killed their neighbours\nbecause they were not quite as liberty-loving as they\nought to have been. Since “liberty” was the foremost virtue\nof man, it was not right that labour-unions should dictate to\ntheir members the hours during which they could work and\nthe wages which they must demand. The workman must at\nall times, be “free to sell his services in the open market,” and\nthe employer must be equally “free” to conduct his business\nas he saw fit. The days of the Mercantile System, when\nthe state had regulated the industrial life of the entire\ncommunity, were coming to an end. The new idea of “freedom\"\ninsisted that the state stand entirely aside and let commerce\ntake its course.",
        "The last half of the 18th century had not merely been a\ntime of intellectual and political doubt, but the old economic\nideas, too, had been replaced by new ones which better suited the\nneed of the hour. Several years before the French revolution,\nTurgot, who had been one of the unsuccessful ministers of\nfinance of Louis XVI, had preached the novel doctrine of\n\"economic liberty.” Turgot lived in a country which had\nsuffered from too much red-tape, too many regulations, too\nmany officials trying to enforce too many laws. “Remove this\nofficial supervision,” he wrote, “let the people do as they please,\nand everything will be all right.” Soon his famous advice of\n\"laissez faire” became the battle-cry around which the economists\nof that period rallied,",
        "At the same time in England, Adam Smith was working\non his mighty volumes on the “Wealth of Nations,” which made\nanother plea for “liberty” and the “natural rights of trade.\"\nThirty years later, after the fall of Napoleon, when the reactionary\npowers of Europe had gained their victory at Vienna,\nthat same freedom which was denied to the people in their\npolitical relations was forced upon them in their industrial\nlife.",
        "The general use of machinery, as I have said at the beginning\nof this chapter, proved to be of great advantage to the\nstate. Wealth increased rapidly. The machine made it possible\nfor a single country, like England, to carry all the burdens\nof the great Napoleonic wars. The capitalists (the people\nwho provided the money with which machines were bought)\nreaped enormous profits. They became ambitious and began\nto take an interest in politics. They tried to compete with the\nlanded aristocracy which still exercised great influence upon\nthe government of most European countries.",
        "In England, where the members of Parliament were still\nelected according to a Royal Decree of the year 1265, and\nwhere a large number of recently created industrial centres were\nwithout representation, they brought about the passing of the\nReform Bill of the year 1882, which changed the electoral\nsystem and gave the class of the factory-owners more influence\nupon the legislative body. This however caused great\ndiscontent among the millions of factory workers, who were\nleft without any voice in the government. They too began\nan agitation for the right to vote. They put their demands\ndown in a document which came to be known as the “People’s\nCharter.” The debates about this charter grew more and\nmore violent. They had not yet come to an end when the revolutions\nof the year 1848 broke out. Frightened by the threat\nof a new outbreak or Jacobinism and violence, the English\ngovernment placed the Duke of Wellington, who was now in\nhis eightieth year, at the head of the army, and called for\nVolunteers. London was placed in a state of siege and\npreparations were made to suppress the coming revolution.",
        "But the Chartist movement killed itself through bad leadership\nand no acts of violence took place. The new class of\nwealthy factory owners, (I dislike the word “bourgeoisie\"\nwhich has been used to death by the apostles of a new social\norder,) slowly increased its hold upon the government, and\nthe conditions of industrial life in the large cities continued to\ntransform vast acres of pasture and wheat-land into dreary\nslums, which guard the approach of every modern European\ntown.",
        "THE GENERAL INTRODUCTION OF MACHINERY\nDID NOT BRING ABOUT THE ERA OF\nHAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY WHICH\nHAD BEEN PREDICTED BY THE GENERATION\nWHICH SAW THE STAGE COACH REPLACED\nBY THE RAILROAD. SEVERAL\nREMEDIES WERE SUGGESTED BUT NONE\nOF THESE QUITE SOLVED THE PROBLEM",
        "IN the year 1831, just before the passing of the first Reform\nBill Jeremy Bentham, the great English student of legislative\nmethods and the most practical political reformer of that\nday, wrote to a friend: “The way to be comfortable is to\nmake others comfortable. The way to make others comfortable\nis to appear to love them. The way to appear to love them\nis to love them in reality.” Jeremy was an honest man. He\nsaid what he believed to be true. His opinions were shared by\nthousands of his countrymen. They felt responsible for the\nhappiness of their less fortunate neighbours and they tried\ntheir very best to help them. And Heaven knows it was time\nthat something be done!",
        "The ideal of “economic freedom” (the “laissez faire” of\nTurgot) had been necessary in the old society where mediaeval\nrestrictions lamed all industrial effort. But this “liberty of\naction” which had been the highest law of the land had led to\na terrible, yea, a frightful condition. The hours in the fac-\ntory were limited only by the physical strength of the workers.\nAs long as a woman could sit before her loom, without\nfainting from fatigue, she was supposed to work. Children of\nfive and six were taken to the cotton mills, to save them from\nthe dangers of the street and a life of idleness. A law had\nbeen passed which forced the children of paupers to go to work\nor be punished by being chained to their machines. In return\nfor their services they got enough bad food to keep them alive\nand a sort of pigsty in which they could rest at night. Often\nthey were so tired that they fell asleep at their job. To keep\nthem awake a foreman with a whip made the rounds and beat\nthem on the knuckles when it was necessary to bring them back\nto their duties. Of course, under these circumstances thousands\nof little children died. This was regrettable and the employers,\nwho after all were human beings and not without a heart, sincerely\nwished that they could abolish “child labour.” But since\nman was “free” it followed that children were “free” too.\nBesides, if Mr. Jones had tried to work his factory without the\nuse of children of five and six, his rival, Mr. Stone, would have\nhired an extra supply of little boys and Jones would have been\nforced into bankruptcy. It was therefore impossible for Jones\nto do without child labour until such time as an act of Parliament\nshould forbid it for all employers.",
        "But as Parliament was no longer dominated by the old\nlanded aristocracy (which had despised the upstart factory-\nowners with their money bags and had treated them with open\ncontempt), but was under control of the representatives from\nthe industrial centres, and as long as the law did not allow\nworkmen to combine in labour-unions, very little was accomplished.\nOf course the intelligent and decent people of that\ntime were not blind to these terrible conditions. They were\njust helpless. Machinery had conquered the world by surprise\nand it took a great many years and the efforts of thousands\nof noble men and women to make the machine what it\nought to be, man’s servant, and not his master.",
        "Curiously enough, the first attack upon the outrageous\nsystem of employment which was then common in all parts of\nthe world, was made on behalf of the black slaves of Africa\nand America. Slavery had been introduced into the American\ncontinent by the Spaniards. They had tried to use the\nIndians as labourers in the fields and in the mines, but the\nIndians, when taken away from a life in the open, had lain down\nand died and to save them from extinction a kind-hearted priest\nhad suggested that negroes be brought from Africa to do the\nwork. The negroes were strong and could stand rough treatment.\nBesides, association with the white man would give\nthem a chance to learn Christianity and in this way, they would\nbe able to save their souls, and so from every possible point of\nview, it would be an excellent arrangement both for the kindly\nwhite man and for his ignorant black brother. But with the\nintroduction of machinery there had been a greater demand for\ncotton and the negroes were forced to work harder than ever\nbefore, and they too, like the Indians, began to die under the\ntreatment which they received at the hands of the overseers.",
        "Stories of incredible cruelty constantly found their way to\nEurope and in all countries men and women began to agitate\nfor the abolition of slavery. In England, William Wilberforce\nand Zachary Macaulay, (the father of the great historian whose\nhistory of England you must read if you want to know how\nwonderfully interesting a history-book can be,) organised a\nsociety for the suppression of slavery. First of all they got a\nlaw passed which made “slave trading” illegal. And after the\nyear 1840 there was not a single slave in any of the British\ncolonies. The revolution of 1848 put an end to slavery in the\nFrench possessions. The Portuguese passed a law in the year\n1858 which promised all slaves their liberty in twenty years\nfrom date. The Dutch abolished slavery in 1863 and in the\nsame year Tsar Alexander II returned to his serfs that liberty\nwhich had been taken away from them more than two centuries\nbefore.",
        "In the United States of America the question led to grave\ndifficulties and a prolonged war. Although the Declaration\nof Independence had laid down the principle that “all men\nwere created free and equal,” an exception had been made for\nthose men and women whose skins were dark and who worked\non the plantations of the southern states. As time went on, the\ndislike of the people of the North for the institution of slavery\nincreased and they made no secret of their feelings. The southerners\nhowever claimed that they could not grow their cotton\nwithout slave-labour, and for almost fifty years a mighty debate\nraged in both the Congress and the Senate.",
        "The North remained obdurate and the South would not give\nin. When it appeared impossible to reach a compromise, the\nsouthern states threatened to leave the Union. It was a most\ndangerous point in the history of the Union. Many things\n\"might” have happened. That they did not happen was the\nwork of a very great and very good man.",
        "On the sixth of November of the year 1860, Abraham Lincoln,\nan Illinois lawyer, and a man who had made his own intellectual\nfortune, had been elected president by the Republicans\nwho were very strong in the anti-slavery states. He\nknew the evils of human bondage at first hand and his shrewd\ncommon-sense told him that there was no room on the northern\ncontinent for two rival nations. When a number of southern\nstates seceded and formed the “Confederate States of America,\"\nLincoln accepted the challenge. The Northern states\nwere called upon for volunteers. Hundreds of thousands of\nyoung men responded with eager enthusiasm and there followed\nfour years of bitter civil war. The South, better prepared\nand following the brilliant leadership of Lee and Jackson,\nrepeatedly defeated the armies of the North. Then the\neconomic strength of New England and the West began to\ntell. An unknown officer by the name of Grant arose from obscurity\nand became the Charles Martel of the great slave war.\nWithout interruption he hammered his mighty blows upon the\ncrumbling defences of the South. Early in the year 1863,\nPresident Lincoln issued his “Emancipation Proclamation\"\nwhich set all slaves free. In April of the year 1865 Lee\nsurrendered the last of his brave armies at Appomattox. A few\ndays later, President Lincoln was murdered by a lunatic. But\nhis work was done. With the exception of Cuba which was\nstill under Spanish domination, slavery had come to an end in\nevery part of the civilised world.",
        "But while the black man was enjoying an increasing amount\nof liberty, the “free” workmen of Europe did not fare quite so\nwell. Indeed, it is a matter of surprise to many contemporary\nwriters and observers that the masses of workmen (the so-\ncalled proletariat) did not die out from sheer misery. They\nlived in dirty houses situated in miserable parts of the slums.\nThey ate bad food. They received just enough schooling to\nfit them for their tasks. In case of death or an accident, their\nfamilies were not provided for. But the brewery and distillery\ninterests, (who could exercise great influence upon the Legislature,)\nencouraged them to forget their woes by offering them\nunlimited quantities of whisky and gin at very cheap rates.",
        "The enormous improvement which has taken place since the\nthirties and the forties of the last century is not due to the efforts\nof a single man. The best brains of two generations devoted\nthemselves to the task of saving the world from the disastrous\nresults of the all-too-sudden introduction of machinery.\nThey did not try to destroy the capitalistic system. This would\nhave been very foolish, for the accumulated wealth of other\npeople, when intelligently used, may be of very great benefit\nto all mankind. But they tried to combat the notion that true\nequality can exist between the man who has wealth and owns\nthe factories and can close their doors at will without the risk\nof going hungry, and the labourer who must take whatever job\nis offered, at whatever wage he can get, or face the risk of\nstarvation for himself, his wife and his children.",
        "They endeavoured to introduce a number of laws which regulated\nthe relations between the factory owners and the factory\nworkers. In this, the reformers have been increasingly\nsuccessful in all countries. To-day, the majority of the labourers\nare well protected; their hours are being reduced to the\nexcellent average of eight, and their children are sent to the\nschools instead of to the mine pit and to the carding-room of\nthe cotton mills.",
        "But there were other men who also contemplated the sight\nof all the belching smoke-stacks, who heard the rattle of the\nrailroad trains, who saw the store-houses filled with a surplus\nof all sorts of materials, and who wondered to what ultimate\ngoal this tremendous activity would lead in the years to come.\nThey remembered that the human race had lived for hundreds\nof thousands of years without commercial and industrial competition.\nCould they change the existing order of things and\ndo away with a system of rivalry which so often sacrificed human\nhappiness to profits?",
        "This idea–this vague hope for a better day–was not restricted\nto a single country. In England, Robert Owen, the\nowner of many cotton mills, established a so-called “socialistic\ncommunity” which was a success. But when he died, the prosperity\nof New Lanark came to an end and an attempt of Louis\nBlanc, a French journalist, to establish “social workshops\"\nall over France fared no better. Indeed, the increasing number\nof socialistic writers soon began to see that little individual\ncommunities which remained outside of the regular industrial\nlife, would never be able to accomplish anything at all. It\nwas necessary to study the fundamental principles underlying\nthe whole industrial and capitalistic society before useful remedies\ncould be suggested.",
        "The practical socialists like Robert Owen and Louis\nBlanc and Francois Fournier were succeeded by theoretical\nstudents of socialism like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Of\nthese two, Marx is the best known. He was a very brilliant\nJew whose family had for a long time lived in Germany. He\nhad heard of the experiments of Owen and Blanc and he began\nto interest himself in questions of labour and wages and\nunemployment. But his liberal views made him very unpopular\nwith the police authorities of Germany, and he was forced to\nflee to Brussels and then to London, where he lived a poor and\nshabby life as the correspondent of the New York Tribune.",
        "No one, thus far, had paid much attention to his books on\neconomic subjects. But in the year 1864 he organised the first\ninternational association of working men and three years later\nin 1867, he published the first volume of his well-known trea-\ntise called “Capital.” Marx believed that all history was a\nlong struggle between those who “have” and those who “don’t\nhave.” The introduction and general use of machinery had\ncreated a new class in society, that of the capitalists who used\ntheir surplus wealth to buy the tools which were then used by\nthe labourers to produce still more wealth, which was again used\nto build more factories and so on, until the end of time. Meanwhile,\naccording to Marx, the third estate (the bourgeoisie)\nwas growing richer and richer and the fourth estate (the proletariat)\nwas growing poorer and poorer, and he predicted that\nin the end, one man would possess all the wealth of the world\nwhile the others would be his employees and dependent upon\nhis good will.",
        "To prevent such a state of affairs, Marx advised working\nmen of all countries to unite and to fight for a number of political\nand economic measures which he had enumerated in a Manifesto\nin the year 1848, the year of the last great European\nrevolution.",
        "These views of course were very unpopular with the governments\nof Europe, many countries, especially Prussia, passed\nsevere laws against the Socialists and policemen were ordered\nto break up the Socialist meetings and to arrest the speakers.\nBut that sort of persecution never does any good. Martyrs\nare the best possible advertisements for an unpopular cause.\nIn Europe the number of socialists steadily increased and it\nwas soon clear that the Socialists did not contemplate a violent\nrevolution but were using their increasing power in the different\nParliaments to promote the interests of the labouring\nclasses. Socialists were even called upon to act as Cabinet\nMinisters, and they co-operated with progressive Catholics and\nProtestants to undo the damage that had been caused by the\nIndustrial Revolution and to bring about a fairer division of\nthe many benefits which had followed the introduction of machinery\nand the increased production of wealth.",
        "BUT THE WORLD HAD UNDERGONE ANOTHER\nCHANGE WHICH WAS OF GREATER\nIMPORTANCE THAN EITHER THE POLITICAL\nOR THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS.\nAFTER GENERATIONS OF OPPRESSION\nAND PERSECUTION, THE SCIENTIST HAD\nAT LAST GAINED LIBERTY OF ACTION\nAND HE WAS NOW TRYING TO DISCOVER\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS WHICH GOVERN\nTHE UNIVERSE",
        "THE Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Chaldeans, the Greeks\nand the Romans, had all contributed something to the first\nvague notions of science and scientific investigation. But the\ngreat migrations of the fourth century had destroyed the classical\nworld of the Mediterranean, and the Christian Church, which\nwas more interested in the life of the soul than in the life of the\nbody, had regarded science as a manifestation of that human arrogance\nwhich wanted to pry into divine affairs which belonged\nto the realm of Almighty God, and which therefore was closely\nrelated to the seven deadly sins.",
        "The Renaissance to a certain but limited extent had broken\nthrough this wall of Mediaeval prejudices. The Reformation,\nhowever, which had overtaken the Renaissance in the early 16th\ncentury, had been hostile to the ideals of the “new civilisation,\"\nand once more the men of science were threatened with severe\npunishment, should they try to pass beyond the narrow limits\nof knowledge which had been laid down in Holy Writ.",
        "Our world is filled with the statues of great generals, atop\nof prancing horses, leading their cheering soldiers to glorious\nvictory. Here and there, a modest slab of marble announces\nthat a man of science has found his final resting place. A thousand\nyears from now we shall probably do these things differently,\nand the children of that happy generation shall know\nof the splendid courage and the almost inconceivable devotion\nto duty of the men who were the pioneers of that abstract\nknowledge, which alone has made our modern world a practical\npossibility.",
        "Many of these scientific pioneers suffered poverty and contempt\nand humiliation. They lived in garrets and died in dungeons.\nThey dared not print their names on the title-pages of\ntheir books and they dared not print their conclusions in the\nland of their birth, but smuggled the manuscripts to some secret\nprinting shop in Amsterdam or Haarlem. They were exposed\nto the bitter enmity of the Church, both Protestant and Catholic,\nand were the subjects of endless sermons, inciting the parishioners\nto violence against the “heretics.”",
        "Here and there they found an asylum. In Holland, where\nthe spirit of tolerance was strongest, the authorities, while\nregarding these scientific investigations with little favour, yet\nrefused to interfere with people’s freedom of thought. It became\na little asylum for intellectual liberty where French and\nEnglish and German philosophers and mathematicians and\nphysicians could go to enjoy a short spell of rest and get a\nbreath of free air.",
        "In another chapter I have told you how Roger Bacon, the\ngreat genius of the thirteenth century, was prevented for years\nfrom writing a single word, lest he get into new troubles with\nthe authorities of the church. And five hundred years later, the\ncontributors to the great philosophic “Encyclopaedia” were under\nthe constant supervision of the French gendarmerie. Half\na century afterwards, Darwin, who dared to question the story\nof the creation of man, as revealed in the Bible, was denounced\nfrom every pulpit as an enemy of the human race.",
        "Even to-day, the persecution of those who venture into the\nunknown realm of science has not entirely come to an end.\nAnd while I am writing this Mr. Bryan is addressing a vast\nmultitude on the “Menace of Darwinism,” warning his hearers\nagainst the errors of the great English naturalist.",
        "All this, however, is a mere detail. The work that has to\nbe done invariably gets done, and the ultimate profit of the\ndiscoveries and the inventions goes to the mass of those same people\nwho have always decried the man of vision as an unpractical idealist.",
        "The seventeenth century had still preferred to investigate\nthe far off heavens and to study the position of our\nplanet in relation to the solar system. Even so, the Church had\ndisapproved of this unseemly curiosity, and Copernicus who\nfirst of all had proved that the sun was the centre of the universe,\ndid not publish his work until the day of his death. Galileo\nspent the greater part of his life under the supervision of the\nclerical authorities, but he continued to use his telescope and\nprovided Isaac Newton with a mass of practical observations,\nwhich greatly helped the English mathematician when he dis-\ncovered the existence of that interesting habit of falling objects\nwhich came to be known as the Law of Gravitation.",
        "That, for the moment at least, exhausted the interest in the\nHeavens, and man began to study the earth. The invention\nof a workable microscope, (a strange and clumsy little thing,)\nby Anthony van Leeuwenhoek during the last half of the 17th\ncentury, gave man a chance to study the “microscopic” creatures\nwho are responsible for so many of his ailments. It laid\nthe foundations of the science of “bacteriology” which in the\nlast forty years has delivered the world from a great number of\ndiseases by discovering the tiny organisms which cause the\ncomplaint. It also allowed the geologists to make a more\ncareful study of different rocks and of the fossils (the petrified\nprehistoric plants) which they found deep below the surface of\nthe earth. These investigations convinced them that the earth\nmust be a great deal older than was stated in the book of\nGenesis and in the year 1830, Sir Charles Lyell published his\n\"Principles of Geology” which denied the story of creation as\nrelated in the Bible and gave a far more wonderful description\nof slow growth and gradual development.",
        "At the same time, the Marquis de Laplace was working on\na new theory of creation, which made the earth a little blotch\nin the nebulous sea out of which the planetary system had\nbeen formed and Bunsen and Kirchhoff, by the use of the\nspectroscope, were investigating the chemical composition of the\nstars and of our good neighbour, the sun, whose curious spots\nhad first been noticed by Galileo.",
        "Meanwhile after a most bitter and relentless warfare with\nthe clerical authorities of Catholic and Protestant lands, the\nanatomists and physiologists had at last obtained permission\nto dissect bodies and to substitute a positive knowledge of our\norgans and their habits for the guesswork of the mediaeval\nquack.",
        "Within a single generation (between 1810 and 1840) more\nprogress was made in every branch of science than in all the\nhundreds of thousands of years that had passed since man first\nlooked at the stars and wondered why they were there. It\nmust have been a very sad age for the people who had been\neducated under the old system. And we can understand their\nfeeling of hatred for such men as Lamarck and Darwin, who\ndid not exactly tell them that they were “descended from\nmonkeys,” (an accusation which our grandfathers seemed to\nregard as a personal insult,) but who suggested that the proud\nhuman race had evolved from a long series of ancestors who\ncould trace the family-tree back to the little jelly-fishes who\nwere the first inhabitants of our planet.",
        "The dignified world of the well-to-do middle class, which\ndominated the nineteenth century, was willing to make use\nof the gas or the electric light, of all the many practical applications\nof the great scientific discoveries, but the mere investigator,\nthe man of the “scientific theory” without whom no\nprogress would be possible, continued to be distrusted until\nvery recently. Then, at last, his services were recognised. Today\nthe rich people who in past ages donated their wealth for\nthe building of a cathedral, construct vast laboratories where\nsilent men do battle upon the hidden enemies of mankind and\noften sacrifice their lives that coming generations may enjoy\ngreater happiness and health.",
        "Indeed it has come to pass that many of the ills of this\nworld, which our ancestors regarded as inevitable “acts of\nGod,” have been exposed as manifestations of our own ignorance\nand neglect. Every child nowadays knows that he can\nkeep from getting typhoid fever by a little care in the choice of\nhis drinking water. But it took years and years of hard\nwork before the doctors could convince the people of this fact.\nFew of us now fear the dentist chair. A study of the microbes\nthat live in our mouth has made it possible to keep our\nteeth from decay. Must perchance a tooth be pulled, then we\ntake a sniff of gas, and go our way rejoicing. When the newspapers\nof the year 1846 brought the story of the “painless\noperation” which had been performed in America with the help\nof ether, the good people of Europe shook their heads. To\nthem it seemed against the will of God that man should escape\nthe pain which was the share of all mortals, and it took a long\ntime before the practice of taking ether and chloroform for\noperations became general.",
        "But the battle of progress had been won. The breach in the\nold walls of prejudice was growing larger and larger, and as\ntime went by, the ancient stones of ignorance came crumbling\ndown. The eager crusaders of a new and happier social order\nrushed forward. Suddenly they found themselves facing a new\nobstacle. Out of the ruins of a long-gone past, another citadel\nof reaction had been erected, and millions of men had to give\ntheir lives before this last bulwark was destroyed.",
        "A CHAPTER OF ART",
        "WHEN a baby is perfectly healthy and has had enough to eat\nand has slept all it wants, then it hums a little tune to show how\nhappy it is. To grown-ups this humming means nothing. It\nsounds like “goo-zum, goo-zum, goo-o-o-o-o,” but to the baby\nit is perfect music. It is his first contribution to art.",
        "As soon as he (or she) gets a little older and is able to sit\nup, the period of mud-pie making begins. These mud-pies do\nnot interest the outside world. There are too many million\nbabies, making too many million mud-pies at the same time.\nBut to the small infant they represent another expedition into\nthe pleasant realm of art. The baby is now a sculptor.",
        "At the age of three or four, when the hands begin to obey\nthe brain, the child becomes a painter. His fond mother gives\nhim a box of coloured chalks and every loose bit of paper is\nrapidly covered with strange pothooks and scrawls which represent\nhouses and horses and terrible naval battles.",
        "Soon however this happiness of just “making things\"\ncomes to an end. School begins and the greater part of the\nday is filled up with work. The business of living, or rather\nthe business of “making a living,” becomes the most important\nevent in the life of every boy and girl. There is little time left\nfor “art” between learning the tables of multiplication and the\npast participles of the irregular French verbs. And unless\nthe desire for making certain things for the mere pleasure of\ncreating them without any hope of a practical return be very\nstrong, the child grows into manhood and forgets that the\nfirst five years of his life were mainly devoted to art.",
        "Nations are not different from children. As soon as the\ncave-man had escaped the threatening dangers of the long and\nshivering ice-period, and had put his house in order, he began\nto make certain things which he thought beautiful, although\nthey were of no earthly use to him in his fight with the wild\nanimals of the jungle. He covered the walls of his grotto with\npictures of the elephants and the deer which he hunted, and\nout of a piece of stone, he hacked the rough figures of those\nwomen he thought most attractive.",
        "As soon as the Egyptians and the Babylonians and the\nPersians and all the other people of the east had founded\ntheir little countries along the Nile and the Euphrates, they\nbegan to build magnificent palaces for their kings, invented\nbright pieces of jewellery for their women and planted gardens\nwhich sang happy songs of colour with their many bright flowers.",
        "Our own ancestors, the wandering nomads from the distant\nAsiatic prairies, enjoying a free and easy existence as\nfighters and hunters, composed songs which celebrated the\nmighty deeds of their great leaders and invented a form of\npoetry which has survived until our own day. A thousand years\nlater, when they had established themselves on the Greek mainland,\nand had built their “city-states,” they expressed their\njoy (and their sorrows) in magnificent temples, in statues, in\ncomedies and in tragedies, and in every conceivable form of\nart.",
        "The Romans, like their Carthaginian rivals, were too busy\nadministering other people and making money to have much\nlove for “useless and unprofitable” adventures of the spirit.\nThey conquered the world and built roads and bridges but they\nborrowed their art wholesale from the Greeks. They invented\ncertain practical forms of architecture which answered the\ndemands of their day and age. But their statues and their histories\nand their mosaics and their poems were mere Latin imi-\ntations of Greek originals. Without that vague and hard-to-\ndefine something which the world calls “personality,” there can\nbe no art and the Roman world distrusted that particular sort\nof personality. The Empire needed efficient soldiers and\ntradesmen. The business of writing poetry or making pictures\nwas left to foreigners.",
        "Then came the Dark Ages. The barbarian was the proverbial\nbull in the china-shop of western Europe. He had no use\nfor what he did not understand. Speaking in terms of the year\n1921, he liked the magazine covers of pretty ladies, but threw\nthe Rembrandt etchings which he had inherited into the ash-\ncan. Soon he came to learn better. Then he tried to undo the\ndamage which he had created a few years before. But the ash-\ncans were gone and so were the pictures.",
        "But by this time, his own art, which he had brought with\nhim from the east, had developed into something very beautiful\nand he made up for his past neglect and indifference by the so-\ncalled “art of the Middle Ages” which as far as northern Europe\nis concerned was a product of the Germanic mind and had\nborrowed but little from the Greeks and the Latins and nothing\nat all from the older forms of art of Egypt and Assyria, not\nto speak of India and China, which simply did not exist, as far\nas the people of that time were concerned. Indeed, so little\nhad the northern races been influenced by their southern neighbours\nthat their own architectural products were completely\nmisunderstood by the people of Italy and were treated by\nthem with downright and unmitigated contempt.",
        "You have all heard the word Gothic. You probably associate\nit with the picture of a lovely old cathedral, lifting its slender\nspires towards high heaven. But what does the word really\nmean?",
        "It means something “uncouth” and “barbaric\"–something\nwhich one might expect from an “uncivilised Goth,” a rough\nbackwoods-man who had no respect for the established rules of\nclassical art and who built his “modern horrors” to please his\nown low tastes without a decent regard for the examples of\nthe Forum and the Acropolis.",
        "And yet for several centuries this form of Gothic architecture\nwas the highest expression of the sincere feeling for art\nwhich inspired the whole northern continent. From a previous\nchapter, you will remember how the people of the late Middle\nAges lived. Unless they were peasants and dwelt in villages,\nthey were citizens of a “city” or “civitas,” the old Latin name\nfor a tribe. And indeed, behind their high walls and their deep\nmoats, these good burghers were true tribesmen who shared\nthe common dangers and enjoyed the common safety and prosperity\nwhich they derived from their system of mutual protection.",
        "In the old Greek and Roman cities the market-place, where\nthe temple stood, had been the centre of civic life. During\nthe Middle Ages, the Church, the House of God, became such a\ncentre. We modern Protestant people, who go to our church\nonly once a week, and then for a few hours only, hardly know\nwhat a mediaeval church meant to the community. Then, before\nyou were a week old, you were taken to the Church to be\nbaptised. As a child, you visited the Church to learn the holy\nstories of the Scriptures. Later on you became a member\nof the congregation, and if you were rich enough you built\nyourself a separate little chapel sacred to the memory of the\nPatron Saint of your own family. As for the sacred edifice,\nit was open at all hours of the day and many of the night. In\na certain sense it resembled a modern club, dedicated to all the\ninhabitants of the town. In the church you very likely caught\na first glimpse of the girl who was to become your bride at a\ngreat ceremony before the High Altar. And finally, when the\nend of the journey had come, you were buried beneath the\nstones of this familiar building, that all your children and their\ngrandchildren might pass over your grave until the Day of\nJudgement.",
        "Because the Church was not only the House of God but\nalso the true centre of all common life, the building had to be\ndifferent from anything that had ever been constructed by\nthe hands of man. The temples of the Egyptians and the\nGreeks and the Romans had been merely the shrine of a local\ndivinity. As no sermons were preached before the images of\nOsiris or Zeus or Jupiter, it was not necessary that the interior\noffer space for a great multitude. All the religious processions\nof the old Mediterranean peoples took place in the open. But\nin the north, where the weather was usually bad,\nmost functions were held under the roof of the church.",
        "During many centuries the architects struggled with\nthis problem of constructing a building that was large\nenough. The Roman tradition taught them how to build heavy\nstone walls with very small windows lest the walls lose\ntheir strength. On the top of this they then placed a\nheavy stone roof. But in the twelfth century, after the\nbeginning of the Crusades, when the architects had seen the\npointed arches of the Mohammedan builders, the western builders\ndiscovered a new style which gave them their first chance to make\nthe sort of building which those days of an intense religious\nlife demanded. And then they developed this strange style upon\nwhich the Italians bestowed the contemptuous name of “Gothic\"or barbaric.\nThey achieved their purpose by inventing a vaulted roof which\nwas supported by “ribs.” But such a roof, if it became\ntoo heavy, was apt to break the walls, just as a man\nof three hundred pounds sitting down upon a child’s chair\nwill force it to collapse. To overcome this difficulty, certain\nFrench architects then began to re-enforce the walls with\n\"buttresses” which were merely heavy masses of stone against\nwhich the walls could lean while they supported the roof. And\nto assure the further safety of the roof they supported the ribs\nof the roof by so-called “flying buttresses,” a very simple\nmethod of construction which you will understand at once when\nyou look at our picture.",
        "This new method of construction allowed the introduction\nof enormous windows. In the twelfth century, glass was still\nan expensive curiosity, and very few private buildings possessed\nglass windows. Even the castles of the nobles were\nwithout protection and this accounts for the eternal drafts\nand explains why people of that day wore furs in-doors as\nwell as out.",
        "Fortunately, the art of making coloured glass, with which\nthe ancient people of the Mediterranean had been familiar,\nhad not been entirely lost. There was a revival of stained\nglass-making and soon the windows of the Gothic churches\ntold the stories of the Holy Book in little bits of brilliantly\ncoloured window-pane, which were caught in a long framework\nof lead.",
        "Behold, therefore, the new and glorious house of God,\nfilled with an eager multitude, “living” its religion as no people\nhave ever done either before or since! Nothing is considered\ntoo good or too costly or too wondrous for this House of God\nand Home of Man. The sculptors, who since the destruction\nof the Roman Empire have been out of employment, haltingly\nreturn to their noble art. Portals and pillars and buttresses\nand cornices are all covered with carven images of Our Lord\nand the blessed Saints. The embroiderers too are set to work\nto make tapestries for the walls. The jewellers offer their\nhighest art that the shrine of the altar may be worthy of complete\nadoration. Even the painter does his best. Poor man,\nhe is greatly handicapped by lack of a suitable medium.",
        "And thereby hangs a story.",
        "The Romans of the early Christian period had covered the\nfloors and the walls of their temples and houses with mosaics;\npictures made of coloured bits of glass. But this art had been\nexceedingly difficult. It gave the painter no chance to express\nall he wanted to say, as all children know who have ever tried to\nmake figures out of coloured blocks of wood. The art of\nmosaic painting therefore died out during the late Middle\nAges except in Russia, where the Byzantine mosaic painters\nhad found a refuge after the fall of Constantinople and continued\nto ornament the walls of the orthodox churches until\nthe day of the Bolsheviki, when there was an end to the building\nof churches.",
        "Of course, the mediaeval painter could mix his colours with\nthe water of the wet plaster which was put upon the walls of\nthe churches. This method of painting upon “fresh plaster\"\n(which was generally called “fresco” or “fresh” painting)\nwas very popular for many centuries. To-day, it is as rare\nas the art of painting miniatures in manuscripts and among\nthe hundreds of artists of our modern cities there is perhaps\none who can handle this medium successfully. But during the\nMiddle Ages there was no other way and the artists were\n\"fresco” workers for lack of something better. The method\nhowever had certain great disadvantages. Very often the\nplaster came off the walls after only a few years, or dampness\nspoiled the pictures, just as dampness will spoil the pattern\nof our wall paper. People tried every imaginable expedient\nto get away from this plaster background. They tried to mix\ntheir colours with wine and vinegar and with honey and with\nthe sticky white of egg, but none of these methods were satisfactory.\nFor more than a thousand years these experiments\ncontinued. In painting pictures upon the parchment leaves\nof manuscripts the mediaeval artists were very successful. But\nwhen it came to covering large spaces of wood or stone with\npaint which would stick, they did not succeed very well.",
        "At last, during the first half of the fifteenth century, the\nproblem was solved in the southern Netherlands by Jan and\nHubert van Eyck. The famous Flemish brothers mixed their\npaint with specially prepared oils and this allowed them to use\nwood and canvas or stone or anything else as a background for\ntheir pictures.",
        "But by this time the religious ardour of the early Middle\nAges was a thing of the past. The rich burghers of the cities\nwere succeeding the bishops as patrons of the arts. And as\nart invariably follows the full dinner-pail, the artists now began\nto work for these worldly employers and painted pictures for\nkings, for grand-dukes and for rich bankers. Within a very\nshort time, the new method of painting with oil spread through\nEurope and in every country there developed a school of\nspecial painting which showed the characteristic tastes of the\npeople for whom these portraits and landscapes were made.",
        "In Spain, for example, Velasquez painted court-dwarfs\nand the weavers of the royal tapestry-factories, and all sorts\nof persons and subjects connected with the king and his court.\nBut in Holland, Rembrandt and Frans Hals and Vermeer\npainted the barnyard of the merchant’s house, and they painted\nhis rather dowdy wife and his healthy but bumptious children\nand the ships which had brought him his wealth. In Italy on\nthe other hand, where the Pope remained the largest patron\nof the arts, Michelangelo and Correggio continued to paint\nMadonnas and Saints, while in England, where the aristocracy\nwas very rich and powerful and in France where the\nkings had become uppermost in the state, the artists painted\ndistinguished gentlemen who were members of the government,\nand very lovely ladies who were friends of His Majesty.",
        "The great change in painting, which came about with the\nneglect of the old church and the rise of a new class in society,\nwas reflected in all other forms of art. The invention of printing\nhad made it possible for authors to win fame and reputation\nby writing books for the multitudes. In this way arose\nthe profession of the novelist and the illustrator. But the\npeople who had money enough to buy the new books were not\nthe sort who liked to sit at home of nights, looking at the ceiling\nor just sitting. They wanted to be amused. The few minstrels\nof the Middle Ages were not sufficient to cover the demand for\nentertainment. For the first time since the early Greek city-\nstates of two thousand years before, the professional playwright\nhad a chance to ply his trade. The Middle Ages had\nknown the theatre merely as part of certain church celebrations.\nThe tragedies of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\nhad told the story of the suffering of our Lord. But\nduring the sixteenth century the worldly theatre made its\nreappearance. It is true that, at first, the position of the\nprofessional playwright and actor was not a very high one.\nWilliam Shakespeare was regarded as a sort of circus-fellow\nwho amused his neighbours with his tragedies and comedies.\nBut when he died in the year 1616 he had begun to enjoy the\nrespect of his neighbours and actors were no longer subjects\nof police supervision.",
        "William’s contemporary, Lope de Vega, the incredible\nSpaniard who wrote no less than 1800 worldly and 400 religious\nplays, was a person of rank who received the papal approval\nupon his work. A century later, Moliere, the Frenchman,\nwas deemed worthy of the companionship of none less\nthan King Louis XIV.",
        "Since then, the theatre has enjoyed an ever increasing\naffection on the part of the people. To-day a “theatre” is part\nof every well-regulated city, and the “silent drama” of the\nmovies has penetrated to the tiniest of our prairie hamlets.",
        "Another art, however, was to become the most popular of\nall. That was music. Most of the old art-forms demanded a\ngreat deal of technical skill. It takes years and years of practice\nbefore our clumsy hand is able to follow the commands of\nthe brain and reproduce our vision upon canvas or in marble.\nIt takes a life-time to learn how to act or how to write a good\nnovel. And it takes a great deal of training on the part of the\npublic to appreciate the best in painting and writing and\nsculpture. But almost any one, not entirely tone-deaf, can\nfollow a tune and almost everybody can get enjoyment out of\nsome sort of music. The Middle Ages had heard a little music\nbut it had been entirely the music of the church. The holy\nchants were subject to very severe laws of rhythm and harmony\nand soon these became monotonous. Besides, they could not\nwell be sung in the street or in the market-place.",
        "The Renaissance changed this. Music once more came\ninto its own as the best friend of man, both in his happiness and\nin his sorrows.",
        "The Egyptians and the Babylonians and the ancient Jews\nhad all been great lovers of music. They had even combined\ndifferent instruments into regular orchestras. But the Greeks\nhad frowned upon this barbaric foreign noise. They liked to\nhear a man recite the stately poetry of Homer and Pindar.\nThey allowed him to accompany himself upon the lyre (the\npoorest of all stringed instruments). That was as far as any\none could go without incurring the risk of popular disapproval.\nThe Romans on the other hand had loved orchestral music at\ntheir dinners and parties and they had invented most of the\ninstruments which (in VERY modified form) we use to-day.\nThe early church had despised this music which smacked too\nmuch of the wicked pagan world which had just been destroyed.\nA few songs rendered by the entire congregation were\nall the bishops of the third and fourth centuries would tolerate.\nAs the congregation was apt to sing dreadfully out of key without\nthe guidance of an instrument, the church had afterwards allowed\nthe use of an organ, an invention of the second century of our era\nwhich consisted of a combination of the old pipes of Pan and\na pair of bellows.",
        "Then came the great migrations. The last of the Roman\nmusicians were either killed or became tramp-fiddlers going\nfrom city to city and playing in the street, and begging for\npennies like the harpist on a modern ferry-boat.",
        "But the revival of a more worldly civilisation in the cities\nof the late Middle Ages had created a new demand for musicians.\nInstruments like the horn, which had been used only\nas signal-instruments for hunting and fighting, were remodelled\nuntil they could reproduce sounds which were agreeable in the\ndance-hall and in the banqueting room. A bow strung with\nhorse-hair was used to play the old-fashioned guitar and before\nthe end of the Middle Ages this six-stringed instrument\n(the most ancient of all string-instruments which dates back\nto Egypt and Assyria) had grown into our modern four-\nstringed fiddle which Stradivarius and the other Italian violin-\nmakers of the eighteenth century brought to the height of perfection.",
        "And finally the modern piano was invented, the most wide-\nspread of all musical instruments, which has followed man into\nthe wilderness of the jungle and the ice-fields of Greenland.\nThe organ had been the first of all keyed instruments but the\nperformer always depended upon the co-operation of some one\nwho worked the bellows, a job which nowadays is done by electricity.\nThe musicians therefore looked for a handier and less\ncircumstantial instrument to assist them in training the pupils\nof the many church choirs. During the great eleventh century,\nGuido, a Benedictine monk of the town of Arezzo (the\nbirthplace of the poet Petrarch) gave us our modern system\nof musical annotation. Some time during that century, when\nthere was a great deal of popular interest in music, the first\ninstrument with both keys and strings was built. It must\nhave sounded as tinkly as one of those tiny children’s pianos\nwhich you can buy at every toy-shop. In the city of Vienna,\nthe town where the strolling musicians of the Middle Ages\n(who had been classed with jugglers and card sharps) had\nformed the first separate Guild of Musicians in the year 1288,\nthe little monochord was developed into something which we\ncan recognise as the direct ancestor of our modern Steinway.\nFrom Austria the “clavichord” as it was usually called in those\ndays (because it had “craves” or keys) went to Italy. There\nit was perfected into the “spinet” which was so called after\nthe inventor, Giovanni Spinetti of Venice. At last during\nthe eighteenth century, some time between 1709 and 1720,\nBartolomeo Cristofori made a “clavier” which allowed the\nperformer to play both loudly and softly or as it was said in\nItalian, “piano” and “forte.” This instrument with certain\nchanges became our “pianoforte” or piano.",
        "Then for the first time the world possessed an easy and convenient\ninstrument which could be mastered in a couple of years\nand did not need the eternal tuning of harps and fiddles and\nwas much pleasanter to the ears than the mediaeval tubas, clarinets,\ntrombones and oboes. Just as the phonograph has given\nmillions of modern people their first love of music so did the\nearly “pianoforte” carry the knowledge of music into much\nwider circles. Music became part of the education of every well-\nbred man and woman. Princes and rich merchants maintained\nprivate orchestras. The musician ceased to be a wandering\n\"jongleur” and became a highly valued member of the community.\nMusic was added to the dramatic performances of\nthe theatre and out of this practice, grew our modern Opera.\nOriginally only a few very rich princes could afford the expenses\nof an “opera troupe.” But as the taste for this sort of\nentertainment grew, many cities built their own theatres where\nItalian and afterwards German operas were given to the unlimited\njoy of the whole community with the exception of a few\nsects of very strict Christians who still regarded music with\ndeep suspicion as something which was too lovely to be entirely\ngood for the soul.",
        "By the middle of the eighteenth century the musical life\nof Europe was in full swing. Then there came forward a\nman who was greater than all others, a simple organist of the\nThomas Church of Leipzig, by the name of Johann Sebastian\nBach. In his compositions for every known instrument, from\ncomic songs and popular dances to the most stately of sacred\nhymns and oratorios, he laid the foundation for all our modern\nmusic. When he died in the year 1750 he was succeeded by\nMozart, who created musical fabrics of sheer loveliness which\nremind us of lace that has been woven out of harmony and\nrhythm. Then came Ludwig van Beethoven, the most tragic\nof men, who gave us our modern orchestra, yet heard none of\nhis greatest compositions because he was deaf, as the result of a\ncold contracted during his years of poverty.",
        "Beethoven lived through the period of the great French\nRevolution. Full of hope for a new and glorious day, he had\ndedicated one of his symphonies to Napoleon. But he lived\nto regret the hour. When he died in the year 1827, Napoleon\nwas gone and the French Revolution was gone, but the steam\nengine had come and was filling the world with a sound that\nhad nothing in common with the dreams of the Third Symphony.",
        "Indeed, the new order of steam and iron and coal and large\nfactories had little use for art, for painting and sculpture and\npoetry and music. The old protectors of the arts, the Church\nand the princes and the merchants of the Middle Ages and the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries no longer existed. The\nleaders of the new industrial world were too busy and had too\nlittle education to bother about etchings and sonatas and bits\nof carved ivory, not to speak of the men who created those\nthings, and who were of no practical use to the community in\nwhich they lived. And the workmen in the factories listened\nto the drone of their engines until they too had lost all taste\nfor the melody of the flute or fiddle of their peasant ancestry.\nThe arts became the step-children of the new industrial era.\nArt and Life became entirely separated. Whatever paintings\nhad been left, were dying a slow death in the museums. And\nmusic became a monopoly of a few “virtuosi” who took the\nmusic away from the home and carried it to the concert-hall.",
        "But steadily, although slowly, the arts are coming back into\ntheir own. People begin to understand that Rembrandt and\nBeethoven and Rodin are the true prophets and leaders of\ntheir race and that a world without art and happiness resembles\na nursery without laughter.",
        "A CHAPTER WHICH OUGHT TO GIVE YOU A\nGREAT DEAL OF POLITICAL INFORMATION\nABOUT THE LAST FIFTY YEARS, BUT\nWHICH REALLY CONTAINS SEVERAL EXPLANATIONS\nAND A FEW APOLOGIES",
        "IF I had known how difficult it was to write a History of\nthe World, I should never have undertaken the task. Of course,\nany one possessed of enough industry to lose himself for half\na dozen years in the musty stacks of a library, can compile a\nponderous tome which gives an account of the events in every\nland during every century. But that was not the purpose of\nthe present book. The publishers wanted to print a history\nthat should have rhythm–a story which galloped rather than\nwalked. And now that I have almost finished I discover that\ncertain chapters gallop, that others wade slowly through the\ndreary sands of long forgotten ages–that a few parts do not\nmake any progress at all, while still others indulge in a veritable\njazz of action and romance. I did not like this and I suggested\nthat we destroy the whole manuscript and begin once\nmore from the beginning. This, however, the publishers would\nnot allow.",
        "As the next best solution of my difficulties, I took the type-\nwritten pages to a number of charitable friends and asked them\nto read what I had said, and give me the benefit of their advice.\nThe experience was rather disheartening. Each and every\nman had his own prejudices and his own hobbies and preferences.\nThey all wanted to know why, where and how I dared\nto omit their pet nation, their pet statesman, or even their most\nbeloved criminal. With some of them, Napoleon and Jenghiz\nKhan were candidates for high honours. I explained that I\nhad tried very hard to be fair to Napoleon, but that in my\nestimation he was greatly inferior to such men as George\nWashington, Gustavus Wasa, Augustus, Hammurabi or\nLincoln, and a score of others all of whom were obliged to\ncontent themselves with a few paragraphs, from sheer lack of\nspace. As for Jenghiz Khan, I only recognise his superior\nability in the field of wholesale murder and I did not intend to\ngive him any more publicity than I could help.",
        "“This is very well as far as it goes,” said the next critic,\n\"but how about the Puritans? We are celebrating the tercentenary\nof their arrival at Plymouth. They ought to have\nmore space.” My answer was that if I were writing a history\nof America, the Puritans would get fully one half of the first\ntwelve chapters; that however this was a history of mankind\nand that the event on Plymouth rock was not a matter of far-\nreaching international importance until many centuries later;\nthat the United States had been founded by thirteen colonies\nand not by a single one; that the most prominent leaders of the\nfirst twenty years of our history had been from Virginia, from\nPennsylvania, and from the island of Nevis, rather than from\nMassachusetts; and that therefore the Puritans ought to content\nthemselves with a page of print and a special map.",
        "Next came the prehistoric specialist. Why in the name of\nthe great Tyrannosaur had I not devoted more space to the\nwonderful race of Cro-Magnon men, who had developed such\na high stage of civilisation 10,000 years ago?",
        "Indeed, and why not? The reason is simple. I do not take\nas much stock in the perfection of these early races as some of\nour most noted anthropologists seem to do. Rousseau and\nthe philosophers of the eighteenth century created the “noble\nsavage” who was supposed to have dwelt in a state of perfect\nhappiness during the beginning of time. Our modern scientists\nhave discarded the “noble savage,” so dearly beloved by\nour grandfathers, and they have replaced him by the “splendid\nsavage” of the French Valleys who 35,000 years ago made an\nend to the universal rule of the low-browed and low-living\nbrutes of the Neanderthal and other Germanic neighbourhoods.\nThey have shown us the elephants the Cro-Magnon painted\nand the statues he carved and they have surrounded him with\nmuch glory.",

        "Then there were other critics, who accused me of direct\nunfairness. Why did I leave out such countries as Ireland\nand Bulgaria and Siam while I dragged in such other countries\nas Holland and Iceland and Switzerland? My answer\nwas that I did not drag in any countries. They pushed themselves\nin by main force of circumstances, and I simply could\nnot keep them out. And in order that my point may be understood,\nlet me state the basis upon which active membership to\nthis book of history was considered.",
        "There was but one rule. “Did the country or the person\nin question produce a new idea or perform an original act\nwithout which the history of the entire human race would have\nbeen different?” It was not a question of personal taste.

No race\never played a more picturesque role in history than the Mongolians,\nand no race, from the point of view of achievement or\nintelligent progress, was of less value to the rest of mankind.",
        "The career of Tiglath-Pileser, the Assyrian, is full of\ndramatic episodes. But as far as we are concerned, he might just\nas well never have existed at all.

        "When we visit a doctor, we find out before hand whether\nhe is a surgeon or a diagnostician or a homeopath or a faith\nhealer, for we want to know from what angle he will look at\nour complaint.

        "In the preface to this book, I told you that I should not be\nan infallible guide and now that we have almost reached the\nend, I repeat the warning. I was born and educated in an\natmosphere of the old-fashioned liberalism which had followed\nthe discoveries of Darwin and the other pioneers of the nineteenth\ncentury. As a child, I happened to spend most of my\nwaking hours with an uncle who was a great collector of the\nbooks written by Montaigne, the great French essayist of the\nsixteenth century. Because I was born in Rotterdam and\neducated in the city of Gouda, I ran continually across\nErasmus and for some unknown reason this great exponent\nof tolerance took hold of my intolerant self.

        "After this short but necessary excursion, we return to the\nhistory of the last fifty years. Many things happened during\nthis period but very little occurred which at the time seemed\nto be of paramount importance. The majority of the greater\npowers ceased to be mere political agencies and became large\nbusiness enterprises. They built railroads. They founded and\nsubsidized steam-ship lines to all parts of the world. They\nconnected their different possessions with telegraph wires.\nAnd they steadily increased their holdings in other continents.\nEvery available bit of African or Asiatic territory was claimed\nby one of the rival powers. France became a colonial nation\nwith interests in Algiers and Madagascar and Annam and\nTonkin (in eastern Asia). Germany claimed parts of southwest\nand east Africa, built settlements in Kameroon on the\nwest coast of Africa and in New Guinea and many of the\nislands of the Pacific, and used the murder of a few missionaries\nas a welcome excuse to take the harbour of Kisochau on the\nYellow Sea in China. Italy tried her luck in Abyssinia, was\ndisastrously defeated by the soldiers of the Negus, and consoled\nherself by occupying the Turkish possessions in Tripoli\nin northern Africa. Russia, having occupied all of Siberia,\ntook Port Arthur away from China. Japan, having defeated\nChina in the war of 1895, occupied the island of Formosa and\nin the year 1905 began to lay claim to the entire empire of\nCorea. In the year 1883 England, the largest colonial empire\nthe world has ever seen, undertook to “protect” Egypt. She\nperformed this task most efficiently and to the great material\nbenefit of that much neglected country, which ever since the\nopening of the Suez canal in 1868 had been threatened with a\nforeign invasion. During the next thirty years she fought a\nnumber of colonial wars in different parts of the world and in\n1902 (after three years of bitter fighting) she conquered the\nindependent Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange\nFree State. Meanwhile she had encouraged Cecil Rhodes to\nlay the foundations for a great African state, which reached\nfrom the Cape almost to the mouth of the Nile, and had faithfully\npicked up such islands or provinces as had been left without\na European owner.",

        "This famous conference was entirely dominated by the personality\nof Disraeli. Even Bismarck feared the clever old\nman with his well-oiled curly hair and his supreme arrogance,\ntempered by a cynical sense of humor and a marvellous gift\nfor flattery. At Berlin the British prime-minister carefully\nwatched over the fate of his friends the Turks. Montenegro,\nSerbia and Roumania were recognised as independent kingdoms.\nThe principality of Bulgaria was given a semi-independent\nstatus under Prince Alexander of Battenberg, a\nnephew of Tsar Alexander II. But none of those countries\nwere given the chance to develop their powers and their resources\nas they would have been able to do, had England been\nless anxious about the fate of the Sultan, whose domains were\nnecessary to the safety of the British Empire as a bulwark\nagainst further Russian aggression.",
        "To make matters worse, the congress allowed Austria to\ntake Bosnia and Herzegovina away from the Turks to be\n\"administered” as part of the Habsburg domains. It is true\nthat Austria made an excellent job of it. The neglected provinces\nwere as well managed as the best of the British colonies,\nand that is saying a great deal. But they were inhabited by\nmany Serbians. In older days they had been part of the great\nSerbian empire of Stephan Dushan, who early in the fourteenth\ncentury had defended western Europe against the invasions\nof the Turks and whose capital of Uskub had been a\ncentre of civilisation one hundred and fifty years before Columbus\ndiscovered the new lands of the west. The Serbians remem-\nbered their ancient glory as who would not? They resented\nthe presence of the Austrians in two provinces, which, so they\nfelt, were theirs by every right of tradition.",
        "And it was in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, that the\narchduke Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne, was murdered\non June 28 of the year 1914. The assassin was a Serbian\nstudent who had acted from purely patriotic motives.",
        "But the blame for this terrible catastrophe which was the\nimmediate, though not the only cause of the Great World War\ndid not lie with the half-crazy Serbian boy or his Austrian\nvictim. It must be traced back to the days of the famous\nBerlin Conference when Europe was too busy building a material\ncivilisation to care about the aspirations and the dreams\nof a forgotten race in a dreary corner of the old Balkan\npeninsula.",
        "THE GREAT WAR WHICH WAS REALLY THE\nSTRUGGLE FOR A NEW AND\nBETTER WORLD",
        "THE Marquis de Condorcet was one of the noblest characters\namong the small group of honest enthusiasts who were\nresponsible for the outbreak of the great French Revolution.\nHe had devoted his life to the cause of the poor and the unfortunate.\nHe had been one of the assistants of d’Alembert and\nDiderot when they wrote their famous Encyclopedie. During\nthe first years of the Revolution he had been the leader of the\nModerate wing of the Convention.",
        "His tolerance, his kindliness, his stout common sense, had\nmade him an object of suspicion when the treason of the king\nand the court clique had given the extreme radicals their chance\nto get hold of the government and kill their opponents.\nCondorcet was declared “hors de loi,” or outlawed, an outcast\nwho was henceforth at the mercy of every true patriot. His\nfriends offered to hide him at their own peril. Condorcet\nrefused to accept their sacrifice. He escaped and tried to reach\nhis home, where he might be safe. After three nights in the\nopen, torn and bleeding, he entered an inn and asked for some\nfood. The suspicious yokels searched him and in his pockets\nthey found a copy of Horace, the Latin poet. This showed\nthat their prisoner was a man of gentle breeding and had no\nbusiness upon the highroads at a time when every educated\nperson was regarded as an enemy of the Revolutionary state.\nThey took Condorcet and they bound him and they gagged\nhim and they threw him into the village lock-up, but in the\nmorning when the soldiers came to drag him back to Paris and\ncut his head off, behold! he was dead.",
        "This man who had given all and had received nothing had\ngood reason to despair of the human race. But he has written\na few sentences which ring as true to-day as they did one\nhundred and thirty years ago. I repeat them here for your\nbenefit.",
        "“Nature has set no limits to our hopes,” he wrote, “and\nthe picture of the human race, now freed from its chains and\nmarching with a firm tread on the road of truth and virtue\nand happiness, offers to the philosopher a spectacle which\nconsoles him for the errors, for the crimes and the injustices\nwhich still pollute and afflict this earth.”",
        "The world has just passed through an agony of pain compared\nto which the French Revolution was a mere incident.\nThe shock has been so great that it has killed the last spark of\nhope in the breasts of millions of men. They were chanting a\nhymn of progress, and four years of slaughter followed their\nprayers for peace. “Is it worth while,” so they ask, “to work\nand slave for the benefit of creatures who have not yet passed\nbeyond the stage of the earliest cave men?”",
        "There is but one answer.",
        "That answer is “Yes!”",
        "The World War was a terrible calamity. But it did not\nmean the end of things. On the contrary it brought about the\ncoming of a new day.",
        "It is easy to write a history of Greece and Rome or the\nMiddle Ages. The actors who played their parts upon that\nlong-forgotten stage are all dead. We can criticize them with\na cool head. The audience that applauded their efforts has\ndispersed. Our remarks cannot possibly hurt their feelings.",
        "But it is very difficult to give a true account of contemporary\nevents. The problems that fill the minds of the people\nwith whom we pass through life, are our own problems, and\nthey hurt us too much or they please us too well to be described\nwith that fairness which is necessary when we are writing\nhistory and not blowing the trumpet of propaganda. All\nthe same I shall endeavour to tell you why I agree with poor\nCondorcet when he expressed his firm faith in a better future.",
        "Often before have I warned you against the false impression\nwhich is created by the use of our so-called historical\nepochs which divide the story of man into four parts, the ancient\nworld, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Reformation,\nand Modern Time. The last of these terms is the most\ndangerous. The word “modern” implies that we, the people\nof the twentieth century, are at the top of human achievement.\nFifty years ago the liberals of England who followed the leadership\nof Gladstone felt that the problem of a truly representative\nand democratic form of government had been solved forever\nby the second great Reform Bill, which gave workmen\nan equal share in the government with their employers. When\nDisraeli and his conservative friends talked of a dangerous\n\"leap in the dark” they answered “No.” They felt certain of\ntheir cause and trusted that henceforth all classes of society\nwould co-operate to make the government of their common\ncountry a success. Since then many things have happened,\nand the few liberals who are still alive begin to understand\nthat they were mistaken.",
        "There is no definite answer to any historical problem.",
        "Every generation must fight the good fight anew or perish\nas those sluggish animals of the prehistoric world have\nperished.",
        "If you once get hold of this great truth you will get a new\nand much broader view of life. Then, go one step further\nand try to imagine yourself in the position of your own great-\ngreat-grandchildren who will take your place in the year\n10,000. They too will learn history. But what will they\nthink of those short four thousand years during which we have\nkept a written record of our actions and of our thoughts?\nThey will think of Napoleon as a contemporary of Tiglath\nPileser, the Assyrian conqueror. Perhaps they will confuse\nhim with Jenghiz Khan or Alexander the Macedonian. The\ngreat war which has just come to an end will appear in the light\nof that long commercial conflict which settled the supremacy\nof the Mediterranean when Rome and Carthage fought during\none hundred and twenty-eight years for the mastery of the sea.\nThe Balkan troubles of the 19th century (the struggle for\nfreedom of Serbia and Greece and Bulgaria and Montenegro)\nto them will seem a continuation of the disordered conditions\ncaused by the Great Migrations. They will look at pictures\nof the Rheims cathedral which only yesterday was destroyed\nby German guns as we look upon a photograph of the Acropolis\nruined two hundred and fifty years ago during a war\nbetween the Turks and the Venetians. They will regard the\nfear of death, which is still common among many people, as a\nchildish superstition which was perhaps natural in a race of\nmen who had burned witches as late as the year 1692. Even\nour hospitals and our laboratories and our operating rooms\nof which we are so proud will look like slightly improved\nworkshops of alchemists and mediaeval surgeons.",
        "And the reason for all this is simple. We modern men and\nwomen are not “modern” at all. On the contrary we still\nbelong to the last generations of the cave-dwellers. The foundation\nfor a new era was laid but yesterday. The human race\nwas given its first chance to become truly civilised when it took\ncourage to question all things and made “knowledge and\nunderstanding” the foundation upon which to create a more\nreasonable and sensible society of human beings. The Great\nWar was the “growing-pain” of this new world.",
        "For a long time to come people will write mighty books to\nprove that this or that or the other person brought about the\nwar. The Socialists will publish volumes in which they will ac-\ncuse the “capitalists” of having brought about the war for “commercial\ngain.” The capitalists will answer that they lost infinitely\nmore through the war than they made–that their children\nwere among the first to go and fight and be killed–and\nthey will show how in every country the bankers tried their\nvery best to avert the outbreak of hostilities. French historians\nwill go through the register of German sins from the\ndays of Charlemagne until the days of William of Hohenzollern\nand German historians will return the compliment and\nwill go through the list of French horrors from the days of\nCharlemagne until the days of President Poincare. And\nthen they will establish to their own satisfaction that the other\nfellow was guilty of “causing the war.” Statesmen, dead and\nnot yet dead, in all countries will take to their typewriters and\nthey will explain how they tried to avert hostilities and how\ntheir wicked opponents forced them into it.",
        "The historian, a hundred years hence, will not bother about\nthese apologies and vindications. He will understand the real\nnature of the underlying causes and he will know that personal\nambitions and personal wickedness and personal greed had very\nlittle to do with the final outburst. The original mistake, which\nwas responsible for all this misery, was committed when our\nscientists began to create a new world of steel and iron and\nchemistry and electricity and forgot that the human mind is\nslower than the proverbial turtle, is lazier than the well-known\nsloth, and marches from one hundred to three hundred years\nbehind the small group of courageous leaders.",
        "A Zulu in a frock coat is still a Zulu. A dog trained to ride\na bicycle and smoke a pipe is still a dog. And a human being\nwith the mind of a sixteenth century tradesman driving a 1921\nRolls-Royce is still a human being with the mind of a sixteenth\ncentury tradesman.",
        "If you do not understand this at first, read it again. It\nwill become clearer to you in a moment and it will explain\nmany things that have happened these last six years.",
        "Perhaps I may give you another, more familiar, example,\nto show you what I mean. In the movie theatres, jokes and\nfunny remarks are often thrown upon the screen. Watch the\naudience the next time you have a chance. A few people seem\nalmost to inhale the words. It takes them but a second to read\nthe lines. Others are a bit slower. Still others take from\ntwenty to thirty seconds. Finally those men and women who\ndo not read any more than they can help, get the point when\nthe brighter ones among the audience have already begun to\ndecipher the next cut-in. It is not different in human life,\nas I shall now show you.",
        "In a former chapter I have told you how the idea of the\nRoman Empire continued to live for a thousand years after\nthe death of the last Roman Emperor. It caused the establishment\nof a large number of “imitation empires.” It gave the\nBishops of Rome a chance to make themselves the head of the\nentire church, because they represented the idea of Roman\nworld-supremacy. It drove a number of perfectly harmless\nbarbarian chieftains into a career of crime and endless warfare\nbecause they were for ever under the spell of this magic\nword “Rome.” All these people, Popes, Emperors and plain\nfighting men were not very different from you or me. But\nthey lived in a world where the Roman tradition was a vital\nissue something living–something which was remembered\nclearly both by the father and the son and the grandson. And\nso they struggled and sacrificed themselves for a cause which\nto-day would not find a dozen recruits.",
        "In still another chapter I have told you how the great religious\nwars took place more than a century after the first open\nact of the Reformation and if you will compare the chapter\non the Thirty Years War with that on Inventions, you will see\nthat this ghastly butchery took place at a time when the first\nclumsy steam engines were already puffing in the laboratories\nof a number of French and German and English scientists.\nBut the world at large took no interest in these strange\ncontraptions, and went on with a grand theological discussion\nwhich to-day causes yawns, but no anger.",
        "And so it goes. A thousand years from now, the historian\nwill use the same words about Europe of the out-going nine-\nteenth century, and he will see how men were engaged upon\nterrific nationalistic struggles while the laboratories all around\nthem were filled with serious folk who cared not one whit for\npolitics as long as they could force nature to surrender a few\nmore of her million secrets.",
        "You will gradually begin to understand what I am driving\nat. The engineer and the scientist and the chemist, within a\nsingle generation, filled Europe and America and Asia with\ntheir vast machines, with their telegraphs, their flying machines,\ntheir coal-tar products. They created a new world in which\ntime and space were reduced to complete insignificance. They\ninvented new products and they made these so cheap that almost\nevery one could buy them. I have told you all this before\nbut it certainly will bear repeating.",
        "To keep the ever increasing number of factories going, the\nowners, who had also become the rulers of the land, needed raw\nmaterials and coal. Especially coal. Meanwhile the mass of\nthe people were still thinking in terms of the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries and clinging to the old notions of the\nstate as a dynastic or political organisation. This clumsy mediaeval\ninstitution was then suddenly called upon to handle the\nhighly modern problems of a mechanical and industrial world.\nIt did its best, according to the rules of the game which had\nbeen laid down centuries before. The different states created\nenormous armies and gigantic navies which were used for the\npurpose of acquiring new possessions in distant lands. Whereever{sic}\nthere was a tiny bit of land left, there arose an English or\na French or a German or a Russian colony. If the natives\nobjected, they were killed. In most cases they did not object,\nand were allowed to live peacefully, provided they did not\ninterfere with the diamond mines or the coal mines or the oil\nmines or the gold mines or the rubber plantations, and they\nderived many benefits from the foreign occupation.",
        "Sometimes it happened that two states in search of raw\nmaterials wanted the same piece of land at the same time.\nThen there was a war. This occurred fifteen years ago when\nRussia and Japan fought for the possession of certain terri-\ntories which belonged to the Chinese people. Such conflicts,\nhowever, were the exception. No one really desired to fight.\nIndeed, the idea of fighting with armies and battleships and\nsubmarines began to seem absurd to the men of the early 20th\ncentury. They associated the idea of violence with the long-\nago age of unlimited monarchies and intriguing dynasties.\nEvery day they read in their papers of still further inventions,\nof groups of English and American and German scientists who\nwere working together in perfect friendship for the purpose\nof an advance in medicine or in astronomy. They lived in a\nbusy world of trade and of commerce and factories. But only\na few noticed that the development of the state, (of the gigantic\ncommunity of people who recognise certain common ideals,)\nwas lagging several hundred years behind. They tried to warn\nthe others. But the others were occupied with their own\naffairs.",
        "I have used so many similes that I must apologise for bringing\nin one more. The Ship of State (that old and trusted\nexpression which is ever new and always picturesque,) of the\nEgyptians and the Greeks and the Romans and the Venetians\nand the merchant adventurers of the seventeenth century had\nbeen a sturdy craft, constructed of well-seasoned wood, and\ncommanded by officers who knew both their crew and their\nvessel and who understood the limitations of the art of navigating\nwhich had been handed down to them by their ancestors.",
        "Then came the new age of iron and steel and machinery.\nFirst one part, then another of the old ship of state was\nchanged. Her dimensions were increased. The sails were discarded\nfor steam. Better living quarters were established, but\nmore people were forced to go down into the stoke-hole, and\nwhile the work was safe and fairly remunerative, they did not\nlike it as well as their old and more dangerous job in the\nrigging. Finally, and almost imperceptibly, the old wooden\nsquare-rigger had been transformed into a modern ocean liner.\nBut the captain and the mates remained the same. They were\nappointed or elected in the same way as a hundred years before.\nThey were taught the same system of navigation which\nhad served the mariners of the fifteenth century. In their\ncabins hung the same charts and signal flags which had done\nservice in the days of Louis XIV and Frederick the Great.\nIn short, they were (through no fault of their own) completely\nincompetent.",
        "The sea of international politics is not very broad. When\nthose Imperial and Colonial liners began to try and outrun\neach other, accidents were bound to happen. They did happen.\nYou can still see the wreckage if you venture to pass\nthrough that part of the ocean.",
        "And the moral of the story is a simple one. The world is\nin dreadful need of men who will assume the new leadership–\nwho will have the courage of their own visions and who will\nrecognise clearly that we are only at the beginning of the\nvoyage, and have to learn an entirely new system of seamanship.",
        "They will have to serve for years as mere apprentices.\nThey will have to fight their way to the top against every possible\nform of opposition. When they reach the bridge, mutiny\nof an envious crew may cause their death. But some day, a\nman will arise who will bring the vessel safely to port, and he\nshall be the hero of the ages.",
        "“The more I think of the problems of our lives, the more I am\n\"persuaded that we ought to choose Irony and Pity for our\n\"assessors and judges as the ancient Egyptians called upon\n\"the Goddess Isis and the Goddess Nephtys on behalf of their\n\"dead.\n\"Irony and Pity are both of good counsel; the first with her\n\"smiles makes life agreeable; the other sanctifies it with her\n\"tears.\n\"The Irony which I invoke is no cruel Deity. She mocks\n\"neither love nor beauty. She is gentle and kindly disposed.\n\"Her mirth disarms and it is she who teaches us to laugh at\n\"rogues and fools, whom but for her we might be so weak as\n\"to despise and hate.”",
