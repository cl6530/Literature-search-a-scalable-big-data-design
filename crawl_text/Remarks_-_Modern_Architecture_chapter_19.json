        "It may be premature, perhaps, but I desire to suggest to anyone who may be\ncontemplating the erection of a summer residence for me, as a slight\ntestimonial of his high regard for my sterling worth and symmetrical\nescutcheon–a testimonial more suggestive of earnest admiration and warm\npersonal friendship than of great intrinsic value, etc., etc., etc., that\nI hope he will not construct it on the modern plan of mental hallucination\nand morbid delirium tremens peculiar to recent architecture.",
        "Of course, a man ought not to look a gift house in the gable end, but if\nmy friends don’t know me any better than to build me a summer cottage and\nthrow in odd windows that nobody else wanted, and then daub it up with\ncolors they have bought at auction and applied to the house after dark\nwith a shotgun, I think it is time that we had a better understanding.",
        "Such a structure does not come within either of the three classes of\nrenaissance. It is neither Florentine, Roman, or Venetian. Any man can\noriginate such a style if he will only drink the right kind of whiskey\nlong enough and then describe the feelings to an amanuensis.",
        "Imagine the sensation that one of these modern, sawed-off cottages would\ncreate a hundred years from now, if it should survive! But that is\nimpossible. The only cheering feature of the whole matter is that these\ncreatures of a disordered imagination must soon pass away, and the bright\nsunlight of hard horse sense shine in through the shattered dormers and\ngables and gnawed-off architecture of the average summer resort.",
        "A friend of mine a few days ago showed me his new house with much pride.\nHe asked me what I thought of it. I told him I liked it first-rate. Then I\nwent home and wept all night. It was my first falsehood.",
        "The house, taken as a whole, looked to me like a skating rink that had\nstarted out to make money, and then suddenly changed its mind and resolved\nto become a tannery. Then ten feet higher it lost all self-respect and\nblossomed into a full-blown drunk and disorderly, surrounded by the\nsmokestack of a foundry and the bright future of thirty days ahead with\nthe chain gang. That’s the way it looked to me.",
        "The roofs were made of little odds and ends of misfit rafters and\ndistorted shingles that somebody had purchased at a sheriff’s sale, and\nthe rooms and stairs were giddy in the extreme.",
        "I went in and rambled around among the cross-eyed staircases and other\nnight-mares till reason tottered on her throne. Then I came out and stood\non the architectural wart, called the side porch, to get fresh air. This\nporch was painted a dull red, and it had wooden rosettes at the corners\nthat looked like a new carbuncle on the nose of a social wreck.",
        "Farther up on the demoralized lumber pile I saw, now and then, places\nwhere the workman’s mind had wandered and he had nailed on his clapboards\nwrong side up, and then painted them with Paris green that he had intended\nto use on something else.",
        "It was an odd looking structure, indeed. If my friend got all the material\nfor nothing from people who had fragments of paint and lumber left over\nafter they failed, and then if the workmen constructed it of night for\nmental relaxation and intellectual repose, without charge, of course the\nscheme was a financial success, but architecturally the house is a gross\nviolation of the statutes in such cases made and provided, and against the\npeace and dignity of the State.",
        "There is a look of extreme poverty about the structure which a man might\nstruggle for years to acquire and then fail. No one could look upon it\nwithout a feeling of heartache for the man who built that house, and\nprobably struggled on year after year, building a little at a time as he\ncould steal the lumber, getting a new workman each year, building a knob\nhere and a protuberance there, putting in a three-cornered window at one\npoint and a yellow tile or a wad of broken glass and other debris at\nanother, patiently filling in around the ranch with any old rubbish that\nother people had got through with, painting it as he went along, taking\nwhat was left in the bottom of the pots after his neighbors had painted\ntheir bob-sleds or their tree boxes–little favors thankfully\nreceived–and then surmounting the whole pile with a potpourri of roof,\nand grand farewell incubus of humps and hollows for the rain to wander\nthrough and seek out the different cells where the lunatics live who\ninhabit it.",
        "I did tell my friend one thing that I thought would improve the looks of\nhis house. He asked me eagerly what it could be. I said it would take a\nman of great courage to do it for him. He said he didn’t care for that. He\nwould do it himself. If it only needed one thing he would never rest till\nhe had it, whatever that might be.",
        "Then I told him that if he had a friend–one he could trust–who would\nsteal in there some night while the family were away, and scratch a match\non the leg of his breeches, or on the breeches of any other gentleman who\nhappened to be present, and hold it where it would ignite the alleged\nhouse, and then remain near there to see that the fire department did not\nmeddle with it, he would confer a great favor on one who would cheerfully\nretaliate in kind on call.",
