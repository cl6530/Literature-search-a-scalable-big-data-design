        "IN THE DESERT",
        "Clinging to that plunging horse Ryder made little attempt at first\nto guide the flight. It was enough to keep himself in the saddle and\nAimée in his arms while every galloping moment flung a farther\ndistance between them and that palace of horror.",
        "His heart was beating in a wild, triumphant exultation. Glorious to\nbe out under the free sky, the wind in his face, the open world\nahead! He felt one with that dashing creature beneath him.",
        "And Aimée was in his arms, untouched, unhurt, out from the power of\nthat sinister man and the expectation of dread things.",
        "The moment was a supreme and glorious emotion.",
        "They were headed south. And to Ryder’s exhilaration this seemed\ngood. Cairo offered no hiding place for that fugitive girl. Even the\nharbor that McLean could give would not be proof against the legal\nforces of the Turks. Law and order, power and police were all in the\nhands of the husband or father. Even now the alarm might be given,\nthe telephones ringing.",
        "Aimée must be hidden until she could be smuggled to France–or\nuntil the French authorities could get out their protective\ndocuments. The hiding place that occurred to Ryder was a wild and\ndesperate expedient.",
        "The American hospital at Siut. The isolation ward–the pretense of\ncontagious illness. And then later travel north, in the care of\nnurses–",
        "All this, if he could win over one of the doctors. At that moment\nwinning over a doctor appeared a sane and simple thing to Ryder’s\nmind. The only difficulty he recognized was getting Aimée into that\nhospital.",
        "But they would not be looking for him in the south. He could manage\nit, he felt jubilantly. He could smuggle her into his diggings at\nnight and then make his arrangements. Anything, everything was\npossible, now that the nightmare of a palace was left behind them.",
        "South they went then, at a quieter pace, the Arab’s rhythmic\nfootfalls ringing through the still, gray world of before dawn.\nAcross the Nile they made their way, working out on sandbars to the\nnarrow depths, where Ryder swam beside the swimming horse while\nAimée clung to the saddle. Then south again along the river road.",
        "The sky was light now. And the river was light. Only the palms and\nthe villages and the flat dhurra fields were dark. And in the east\nbehind the Mokattam hills a thin band of gold began to brighten.",
        "Life was stirring. Small black boys on huge black buffaloes\nsplashed in the river. Veiled girls with water jars on their\nhigh-held heads from which the shawls trailed down to the dust filed\npast from the villages like a Parthenon frieze. On the high banks\nthe naked fellaheen were already stooping to the incessant dipping\nof the shadouf, while from the fields came the plaintive creaking of\nthe well sweep, as some harnessed camel or bullock began its eternal\nround.",
        "A flock of sheep came down the river road, driven by their ragged\nshepherds, and a string of camels, burdened beyond all semblance to\nthemselves, bobbed by like rhythmic haystacks, led by a black-robed,\nbare-footed child, carrying a live turkey in her arms while before\nher rode her father, in shining pongee robes on a white donkey\nstrung with beads of blue.",
        "And by these travelers there passed in that brightening dawn two\nother travelers from the north, a pair on a powerful but tired black\nhorse, a man in a military cloak and a green and gold turban about\nhis bronzed head, and behind him, on a pillion, a black-mantled,\nblack-veiled girl, with bare, dangling feet.",
        "It was Aimée who had evolved the disguise, constructing the turban\nfrom the negligee beneath her mantle, and it was Aimée who bargained\nwith the villagers for their breakfast, eggs and goats’ milk and\nbread and rice, while her lord, as befitted his dignity, stayed\naloof upon his steed, returning a courteous response of ’Allah\nsalimak–God bless you” to their greetings.",
        "Then as the day brightened and the last soft veil of mist was\nburned away before a blood-red sun, that pair of travelers left the\nhighroad and turned west upon a byway that led past fields of corn\nand yellow water and mud villages where goats and naked babies and\nragged women squatted idly in the dust, and on through low,\nred-granite hills swirled about with yellow sand drift and out into\nthe desert beyond.",
        "Here fresh vigor came to the Arab horse, and tossing his mane and\nstretching out his nostrils to the dry air he broke into a gallop\nthat sent sand and pebbles flying from his hoofs. To right and left\nthe startled desert hares scattered, and from the clumps of spiky\nhelga the black vultures rose in heavy-winged flight.",
        "Then the breeze dropped, and the swift-coming heat rushed at them\nlike a furnace breath, and slower and slower they made their way,\nRyder leading the jaded horse and Aimée nodding in the saddle, mere\ncrawling specks across the immensity of sand.",
        "Then, in the shade of a huge clump of gray-green mit minan beside\na jutting boulder they stopped at last to rest. The horse sank on\nhis knees; Ryder spread out his cloak and Aimée dropped down upon\nits folds, lost in exhausted sleep as soon as her head touched the\nsands. Ryder, his back against the rock, kept watch.",
        "It was not the exultant Ryder of that first hour of flight. The\nexcitement of the night had subsided and withdrawn its wild\nstimulation. It was a hot and tired and immensely sobered young man\nwho sat there with eyes that burned from lack of sleep and a brow\nknit into a taut and anxious line.",
        "Realization flooded him with the sun. Responsibility burned in upon\nhim with the heat.",
        "Alone in the Libyan desert he sat there, and at his feet there slept\nthe young girl whose life he had snapped utterly off from its roots.",
        "He was overwhelmingly responsible for her. If she had never met him,\nif he had never continued to thrust himself upon her, she would have\ngone on her predestined way, safe, secluded, luxurious–vaguely\nunhappy and mutinous at times, perhaps, in the secret stirrings of\nher blood, but still an indulged and wealthy little Moslem.",
        "And now–she lay there, like a sleeping child, the dark tendrils of\nhair clinging to her moist, sun-flushed cheeks, her long lashes\nmingling their shadows with the purple underlining of the night’s\nterrors, homeless, exhausted, resourceless but for that anxious-eyed\nyoung man.",
        "Desperately he hoped that she would not wake to regret. Even a\nsardonic tyrant in a palace might be preferable in the merciless\ndaylight to a helpless young man in the Libyan desert.",
        "And she was so slight, so delicate, so made for rich and lovely\nluxury.... Looking down at her he felt a lump in his throat ... a\nlump of queer, choking tenderness....",
        "He wanted to protect her, to save her, to spend himself for her....\nHe felt for her a reverent wonder, a stirring that was at once\nprotective and possessive and denying of all self.",
        "He would die to save her. He tried to tell himself reassuringly that\nhe had saved her.... If only he could keep her safe....",
        "He thought of the life before her. He thought of that family in\nFrance in whose name he had urged his interference. That unknown\nDelcassé aunt who had sent out her agents for her lost heirs–would\nshe welcome and endow this lovely girl?",
        "He could not doubt it.... Aimée’s youth and beauty would be treasure\ntrove to a jaded lonely woman with money to invest in futures. Aimée\nwould be a belle, an heiress....",
        "He looked down at her with a sudden darkness in his young eyes....\nAnd still she slept, wrapped in the sorry mantle of his masquerade,\nthe torn chiffons of her negligée fluttering over her slim, bare\nfeet.",
