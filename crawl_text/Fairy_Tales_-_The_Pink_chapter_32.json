        "There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\nEvery morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\nbestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to\nher and said: ’Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of\nwishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he\nhave.’ Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and\nwhen the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was\nfilled with gladness.",
        "Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild\nbeasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It\nhappened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in\nher arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that\nthe child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a\nhen, and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the\nqueen’s apron and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a\nsecret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to\nthe king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken\nfrom her by the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron,\nhe believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high\ntower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had\nhis wife put into it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven\nyears without meat or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two\nangels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to her\ntwice a day, and carried her food until the seven years were over.",
        "The cook, however, thought to himself: ’If the child has the power of\nwishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.’ So\nhe left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to\nspeak, and said to him: ’Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with\na garden, and all else that pertains to it.’ Scarcely were the words\nout of the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished\nfor. After a while the cook said to him: ’It is not well for you to be\nso alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.’ Then the king’s son\nwished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more\nbeautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played\ntogether, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook\nwent out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him,\nhowever, that the king’s son might some day wish to be with his\nfather, and thus bring him into great peril. So he went out and took\nthe maiden aside, and said: ’Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his\nbed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and\ntongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life.’ Thereupon\nhe went away, and when he returned next day she had not done it, and\nsaid: ’Why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never\nharmed anyone?’ The cook once more said: ’If you do not do it, it\nshall cost you your own life.’ When he had gone away, she had a little\nhind brought to her, and ordered her to be killed, and took her heart\nand tongue, and laid them on a plate, and when she saw the old man\ncoming, she said to the boy: ’Lie down in your bed, and draw the\nclothes over you.’ Then the wicked wretch came in and said: ’Where are\nthe boy’s heart and tongue?’ The girl reached the plate to him, but\nthe king’s son threw off the quilt, and said: ’You old sinner, why did\nyou want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence. You shall\nbecome a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck, and\nshall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your\nthroat.’ And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\ninto a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\nwere ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\nflames broke forth from his throat. The king’s son remained there a\nshort while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she\nwere still alive. At length he said to the maiden: ’I will go home to\nmy own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.’ ’Ah,’\nshe replied, ’the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange\nland where I am unknown?’ As she did not seem quite willing, and as\nthey could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be\nchanged into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went\naway to his own country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went\nto the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high,\nhe wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he\nmounted up and looked inside, and cried: ’Beloved mother, Lady Queen,\nare you still alive, or are you dead?’ She answered: ’I have just\neaten, and am still satisfied,’ for she thought the angels were there.\nSaid he: ’I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have\ntorn from your arms; but I am alive still, and will soon set you\nfree.’ Then he descended again, and went to his father, and caused\nhimself to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could\noffer him service. The king said yes, if he was skilful and could get\ngame for him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up\ntheir quarters in any part of the district or country. Then the\nhuntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly\nuse at the royal table. So he summoned all the huntsmen together, and\nbade them go out into the forest with him. And he went with them and\nmade them form a great circle, open at one end where he stationed\nhimself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more came running\ninside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them. Then they were\nall placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the king, and\nfor once he was able to deck his table with game, after having had\nnone at all for years.",
        "Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\nhousehold should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When\nthey were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: ’As you are\nso clever, you shall sit by me.’ He replied: ’Lord King, your majesty\nmust excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.’ But the king insisted on it,\nand said: ’You shall sit by me,’ until he did it. Whilst he was\nsitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one\nof the king’s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and\nwould ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she\nwere alive still, or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than\nthe marshal began, and said: ’Your majesty, we live joyously here, but\nhow is the queen living in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she\ndied?’ But the king replied: ’She let my dear son be torn to pieces by\nwild beasts; I will not have her named.’ Then the huntsman arose and\nsaid: ’Gracious lord father she is alive still, and I am her son, and\nI was not carried away by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old\ncook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her\napron with the blood of a chicken.’ Thereupon he took the dog with the\ngolden collar, and said: ’That is the wretch!’ and caused live coals\nto be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before the\nsight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat. On this the\nhuntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true\nshape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in the which he\nstood immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side.\nWhen the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be\ncast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman spoke further and\nsaid: ’Father, will you see the maiden who brought me up so tenderly\nand who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it, though her own\nlife depended on it?’ The king replied: ’Yes, I would like to see\nher.’ The son said: ’Most gracious father, I will show her to you in\nthe form of a beautiful flower,’ and he thrust his hand into his\npocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,\nand it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.\nThen the son said: ’Now will I show her to you in her own form,’ and\nwished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so\nbeautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.",
        "And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,\nto fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was\nled in she ate nothing, and said: ’The gracious and merciful God who\nhas supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.’ She lived three\ndays more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two\nwhite doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels\nof heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The\naged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief\nconsumed the king’s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the\nbeautiful maiden whom he had brought with him as a flower in his\npocket, and whether they are still alive or not, is known to God.",
