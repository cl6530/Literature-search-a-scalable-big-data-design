        "SLANG",
        "Origin–American Slang–Foreign Slang",
        "Slang is more or less common in nearly all ranks of society and in every\nwalk of life at the present day. Slang words and expressions have crept\ninto our everyday language, and so insiduously, that they have not been\ndetected by the great majority of speakers, and so have become part and\nparcel of their vocabulary on an equal footing with the legitimate words\nof speech. They are called upon to do similar service as the ordinary\nwords used in everyday conversation–to express thoughts and desires and\nconvey meaning from one to another. In fact, in some cases, slang has\nbecome so useful that it has far outstripped classic speech and made for\nitself such a position in the vernacular that it would be very hard in\nsome cases to get along without it. Slang words have usurped the place of\nregular words of language in very many instances and reign supreme in\ntheir own strength and influence.",
        "Cant and slang are often confused in the popular mind, yet they are not\nsynonymous, though very closely allied, and proceeding from a common\nGypsy origin. Cant is the language of a certain class–the peculiar\nphraseology or dialect of a certain craft, trade or profession, and is\nnot readily understood save by the initiated of such craft, trade or\nprofession. It may be correct, according to the rules of grammar, but it\nis not universal; it is confined to certain parts and localities and is\nonly intelligible to those for whom it is intended. In short, it is an\nesoteric language which only the initiated can understand. The jargon, or\npatter, of thieves is cant and it is only understood by thieves who have\nbeen let into its significance; the initiated language of professional\ngamblers is cant, and is only intelligible to gamblers.",
        "On the other hand, slang, as it is nowadays, belongs to no particular class\nbut is scattered all over and gets entre into every kind of society and\nis understood by all where it passes current in everyday expression. Of\ncourse, the nature of the slang, to a great extent, depends upon the\nlocality, as it chiefly is concerned with colloquialisms or words and\nphrases common to a particular section. For instance, the slang of London\nis slightly different from that of New York, and some words in the one city\nmay be unintelligible in the other, though well understood in that in which\nthey are current. Nevertheless, slang may be said to be universally\nunderstood. “To kick the bucket,” “to cross the Jordan,” “to hop the twig\"\nare just as expressive of the departing from life in the backwoods of\nAmerica or the wilds of Australia as they are in London or Dublin.",
        "Slang simply consists of words and phrases which pass current but are not\nrefined, nor elegant enough, to be admitted into polite speech or\nliterature whenever they are recognized as such. But, as has been said, a\ngreat many use slang without their knowing it as slang and incorporate it\ninto their everyday speech and conversation.",
        "Some authors purposely use slang to give emphasis and spice in familiar and\nhumorous writing, but they should not be imitated by the tyro. A master,\nsuch as Dickens, is forgivable, but in the novice it is unpardonable.",
        "There are several kinds of slang attached to different professions and\nclasses of society. For instance, there is college slang, political\nslang, sporting slang, etc. It is the nature of slang to circulate freely\namong all classes, yet there are several kinds of this current form of\nlanguage corresponding to the several classes of society. The two great\ndivisions of slang are the vulgar of the uneducated and coarse-minded,\nand the high-toned slang of the so-called upper classes–the educated and\nthe wealthy. The hoyden of the gutter does not use the same slang as my\nlady in her boudoir, but both use it, and so expressive is it that the\none might readily understand the other if brought in contact. Therefore,\nthere are what may be styled an ignorant slang and an educated slang–the\none common to the purlieus and the alleys, the other to the parlor and\nthe drawing-room.",
        "In all cases the object of slang is to express an idea in a more vigorous,\npiquant and terse manner than standard usage ordinarily admits. A school\ngirl, when she wants to praise a baby, exclaims: “Oh, isn’t he awfully\ncute!” To say that he is very nice would be too weak a way to express her\nadmiration. When a handsome girl appears on the street an enthusiastic\nmasculine admirer, to express his appreciation of her beauty, tells you:\n“She is a peach, a bird, a cuckoo,” any of which accentuates his\nestimation of the young lady and is much more emphatic than saying: “She\nis a beautiful girl,” “a handsome maiden,” or “lovely young woman.”",
        "When a politician defeats his rival he will tell you “it was a cinch,” he\nhad a “walk-over,” to impress you how easy it was to gain the victory.",
        "Some slang expressions are of the nature of metaphors and are highly\nfigurative. Such are “to pass in your checks,” “to hold up,” “to pull the\nwool over your eyes,” “to talk through your hat,” “to fire out,” “to go\nback on,” “to make yourself solid with,” “to have a jag on,” “to be\nloaded,” “to freeze on to,” “to bark up the wrong tree,” “don’t monkey\nwith the buzz-saw,” and “in the soup.” Most slang had a bad origin. The\ngreater part originated in the cant of thieves’ Latin, but it broke away\nfrom this cant of malefactors in time and gradually evolved itself from\nits unsavory past until it developed into a current form of expressive\nspeech. Some slang, however, can trace its origin back to very\nrespectable sources.",
        "“Stolen fruits are sweet” may be traced to the Bible in sentiment.\nProverbs, ix:17 has it: “Stolen waters are sweet.” “What are you giving\nme,” supposed to be a thorough Americanism, is based upon Genesis,\nxxxviii:16. The common slang, “a bad man,” in referring to Western\ndesperadoes, in almost the identical sense now used, is found in\nSpenser’s Faerie Queen, Massinger’s play “A New Way to Pay Old\nDebts,” and in Shakespeare’s “King Henry VIII.” The expression “to\nblow on,” meaning to inform, is in Shakespeare’s “As You Like it.\"\n“It’s all Greek to me” is traceable to the play of “Julius Caesar.\"\n“All cry and no wool” is in Butler’s “Hudibras.” “Pious frauds,\"\nmeaning hypocrites, is from the same source. “Too thin,” referring to an\nexcuse, is from Smollett’s ’Peregrine Pickle.” Shakespeare also used\nit.",
        "America has had a large share in contributing to modern slang. “The\nheathen Chinee,” and “Ways that are dark, and tricks that are vain,” are\nfrom Bret Harte’s Truthful James. “Not for Joe,” arose during the Civil\nWar when one soldier refused to give a drink to another. “Not if I know\nmyself” had its origin in Chicago. “What’s the matter with––? He’s all\nright,” had its beginning in Chicago also and first was “What’s the\nmatter with Hannah.” referring to a lazy domestic servant. “There’s\nmillions in it,” and “By a large majority” come from Mark Twain’s Gilded\nAge. “Pull down your vest,” “jim-jams,” “got ’em bad,” “that’s what’s\nthe matter,” “go hire a hall,” “take in your sign,” “dry up,” “hump\nyourself,” “it’s the man around the corner,” “putting up a job,” “put a\nhead on him,” “no back talk,” “bottom dollar,” “went off on his ear,\"\n“chalk it down,” “staving him off,” “making it warm,” “dropping him\ngently,” “dead gone,” “busted,” “counter jumper,” “put up or shut up,\"\n“bang up,” “smart Aleck,” “too much jaw,” “chin-music,” “top heavy,\"\n“barefooted on the top of the head,” “a little too fresh,” “champion\nliar,” “chief cook and bottle washer,” “bag and baggage,” “as fine as\nsilk,” “name your poison,” “died with his boots on,” “old hoss,” “hunkey\ndorey,” “hold your horses,” “galoot” and many others in use at present\nare all Americanisms in slang.",
        "California especially has been most fecund in this class of figurative\nlanguage. To this State we owe “go off and die,” “don’t you forget it,\"\n“rough deal,” “square deal,” “flush times,” “pool your issues,” “go bury\nyourself,” “go drown yourself,” “give your tongue a vacation,” “a bad\negg,” “go climb a tree,” “plug hats,” “Dolly Vardens,” “well fixed,\"\n“down to bed rock,” “hard pan,” “pay dirt,” “petered out,” “it won’t\nwash,” “slug of whiskey,” “it pans out well,” and “I should smile.\"\n“Small potatoes, and few in the hill,” “soft snap,” “all fired,” “gol\ndurn it,” “an up-hill job,” “slick,” “short cut,” “guess not,” “correct\nthing” are Bostonisms. The terms “innocent,” “acknowledge the corn,\"\n“bark up the wrong tree,” “great snakes,” “I reckon,” “playing ’possum,\"\n“dead shot,” had their origin in the Southern States. “Doggone it,” “that\nbeats the Dutch,” “you bet,” “you bet your boots,” sprang from New York.\n“Step down and out” originated in the Beecher trial, just as\n“brain-storm” originated in the Thaw trial.",
        "Among the slang phrases that have come directly to us from England may be\nmentioned “throw up the sponge,” “draw it mild,” “give us a rest,” “dead\nbeat,” “on the shelf,” “up the spout,” “stunning,” “gift of the gab,\"\netc.",
        "The newspapers are responsible for a large part of the slang. Reporters,\nstaff writers, and even editors, put words and phrases into the mouths of\nindividuals which they never utter. New York is supposed to be the\nheadquarters of slang, particularly that portion of it known as the\nBowery. All transgressions and corruptions of language are supposed to\noriginate in that unclassic section, while the truth is that the laws of\npolite English are as much violated on Fifth Avenue. Of course, the\nforeign element mincing their “pidgin” English have given the Bowery an\nunenviable reputation, but there are just as good speakers of the\nvernacular on the Bowery as elsewhere in the greater city. Yet every\ninexperienced newspaper reporter thinks that it is incumbent on him to\nhold the Bowery up to ridicule and laughter, so he sits down, and out of\nhis circumscribed brain, mutilates the English tongue (he can rarely coin\na word), and blames the mutilation on the Bowery.",
        "’Tis the same with newspapers and authors, too, detracting the Irish\nrace. Men and women who have never seen the green hills of Ireland, paint\nIrish characters as boors and blunderers and make them say ludicrous\nthings and use such language as is never heard within the four walls of\nIreland. ’Tis very well known that Ireland is the most learned country on\nthe face of the earth–is, and has been. The schoolmaster has been abroad\nthere for hundreds, almost thousands, of years, and nowhere else in the\nworld to-day is the king’s English spoken so purely as in the cities and\ntowns of the little Western Isle.",
        "Current events, happenings of everyday life, often give rise to slang\nwords, and these, after a time, come into such general use that they take\ntheir places in everyday speech like ordinary words and, as has been\nsaid, their users forget that they once were slang. For instance, the\ndays of the Land League in Ireland originated the word boycott, which\nwas the name of a very unpopular landlord, Captain Boycott. The people\nrefused to work for him, and his crops rotted on the ground. From this\ntime any one who came into disfavor and whom his neighbors refused to\nassist in any way was said to be boycotted. Therefore to boycott means to\npunish by abandoning or depriving a person of the assistance of others.\nAt first it was a notoriously slang word, but now it is standard in the\nEnglish dictionaries.",
        "Politics add to our slang words and phrases. From this source we get\n“dark horse,” “the gray mare is the better horse,” “barrel of money,\"\n“buncombe,” “gerrymander,” “scalawag,” “henchman,” “logrolling,” “pulling\nthe wires,” “taking the stump,” “machine,” “slate,” etc.",
        "The money market furnishes us with “corner,” “bull,” “bear,” “lamb,\"\n“slump,” and several others.",
        "The custom of the times and the requirements of current expression require\nthe best of us to use slang words and phrases on occasions. Often we do\nnot know they are slang, just as a child often uses profane words without\nconsciousness of their being so. We should avoid the use of slang as much\nas possible, even when it serves to convey our ideas in a forceful\nmanner. And when it has not gained a firm foothold in current speech it\nshould be used not at all. Remember that most all slang is of vulgar\norigin and bears upon its face the bend sinister of vulgarity. Of the\nslang that is of good birth, pass it by if you can, for it is like a\nbroken-down gentleman, of little good to any one. Imitate the great\nmasters as much as you will in classical literature, but when it comes to\ntheir slang, draw the line. Dean Swift, the great Irish satirist, coined\nthe word “phiz” for face. Don’t imitate him. If you are speaking or\nwriting of the beauty of a lady’s face don’t call it her “phiz.” The\nDean, as an intellectual giant, had a license to do so–you haven’t.\nShakespeare used the word “flush” to indicate plenty of money. Well, just\nremember there was only one Shakespeare, and he was the only one that had\na right to use that word in that sense. You’ll never be a Shakespeare,\nthere will never be such another–Nature exhausted herself in producing\nhim. Bulwer used the word “stretch” for hang, as to stretch his neck.\nDon’t follow his example in such use of the word. Above all, avoid the\nlow, coarse, vulgar slang, which is made to pass for wit among the\nriff-raff of the street. If you are speaking or writing of a person\nhaving died last night don’t say or write: “He hopped the twig,” or “he\nkicked the bucket.” If you are compelled to listen to a person discoursing\non a subject of which he knows little or nothing, don’t say “He is\ntalking through his hat.” If you are telling of having shaken hands with\nMr. Roosevelt don’t say “He tipped me his flipper.” If you are speaking\nof a wealthy man don’t say “He has plenty of spondulix,” or “the long\ngreen.” All such slang is low, coarse and vulgar and is to be frowned\nupon on any and every occasion.",
        "If you use slang use the refined kind and use it like a gentleman, that\nit will not hurt or give offense to any one. Cardinal Newman defined a\ngentleman as he who never inflicts pain. Be a gentleman in your slang–\nnever inflict pain.",
