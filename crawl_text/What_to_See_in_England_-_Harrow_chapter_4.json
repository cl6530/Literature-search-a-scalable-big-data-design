        "Harrow, from its high position, 200 feet above the sea, was selected by\nthe Romans as an important military station. By the Saxons it was called\nHereways, and was purchased in 822 by Wilfred, Archbishop of Canterbury.\nThe ancient manor-house, of which no traces now remain, was formerly the\nresidence of the Archbishops of Canterbury, and it was here that Thomas\nà Becket resided during his banishment from Court. Cardinal Wolsey, who\nwas once Rector of Harrow, resided at Pinner, and is said to have\nentertained Henry VIII. during his visit to Harrow. The manor was\nexchanged by Archbishop Cranmer with the king for other lands, and was\nsubsequently given to Sir Edmund Dudley, afterwards Lord North.",
        "At the bottom of the hill, and spreading rapidly in all directions, are\nquantities of modern houses and villas, but the point of greatest\ninterest in Harrow is the celebrated school, wonderfully situated on the\nvery summit of the hill, with views extending over thirteen counties.\nFounded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by John Lyon, a yeoman of the\nparish, the school has now grown enormously, the oldest portion being\nthat near the church, which was erected three years after the founder’s\ndeath. In the wainscotting of the famous schoolroom are the carvings cut\nby many generations of Harrovians, among them being the names of Peel,\nByron, Sheridan, the Marquess of Hastings, Lord Normanby, and many\nothers.",
        "The church stands on the extreme summit of the hill, and from the\nchurchyard the view is simply magnificent. In the building are some\ninteresting tombs and brasses, and a monument to John Lyon, the founder\nof the school.",
        "The grave shown on the opposite page is known as “Byron’s tomb,” on\naccount of his fondness for the particular spot it occupied in the\nchurchyard, from whence the fascinating view just mentioned can be seen,\nfrom the shade of the trees growing on either side.",
