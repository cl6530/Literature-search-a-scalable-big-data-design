        "Sam",
        "Sam Raften turned out to be more congenial than he looked. His slow,\ndrawling speech had given a wrong impression of stupidity, and, after\na formal showing of the house under Mr. Raften, a real investigation\nwas headed by Sam. “This yer’s the paaar-le-r,” said he, unlocking a\nsort of dark cellar aboveground and groping to open what afterward\nproved to be a dead, buried and almost forgotten window. In Sanger\nsettlement the farmhouse parlour is not a room; it is an institution.\nIt is kept closed all the week except when the minister calls, and\nthe one at Raften’s was the pure type. Its furniture consisted of six\npainted chairs (fifty cents each), two rockers ($1.49), one melodeon\n(thirty-two bushels of wheat–the agent asked forty), a sideboard made\nat home of the case the melodeon came in, one rag carpet woofed at\nhome and warped and woven in exchange for wool, one center-table\nvarnished (!) ($9.00 cash, $11.00 catalogue). On the center-table was\none tintype album, a Bible, and some large books for company use.\nThough dusted once a week, they were never moved, and it was years\nlater before they were found to have settled permanently into the\nvarnish of the table. In extremely uncostly frames on the wall were\nthe coffin-plates of the departed members of the family. It was the\ncustom at Sanger to honour the dead by bringing back from the funeral\nthe name-plate and framing it on a black background with some supposed\nappropriate scripture text.",
        "The general atmosphere of the room was dusty and religious as it\nwas never opened except on Sundays or when the parson called, which\ninstituted a sort of temporary Sunday, and the two small windows were\nkept shut and plugged as well as muffled always, with green paper\nblinds and cotton hangings. It was a thing apart from the rest of the\nhouse–a sort of family ghost-room: a chamber of horrors, seen but\nonce a week.",
        "But it contained one thing at least of interest–something that at\nonce brought Sam and Yan together. This was a collection of a score\nof birds’ eggs. They were all mixed together in an old glass-topped\ncravat box, half full of bran. None of them were labelled or properly\nblown. A collector would not have given it a second glance, but it\nproved an important matter. It was as though two New Yorkers, one\ndisguised as a Chinaman and the other as a Negro, had accidently\nmet in Greenland and by chance one had made the sign of the secret\nbrotherhood to which they both belonged.",
        "“Do you like these things?” said Yan, with sudden interest and warmth,\nin spite of the depressing surroundings.",
        "“You bet,” said Sam. “And I’d a-had twice as many only Da said it was\ndoing no good and birds was good for the farm.”",
        "“Well, do you know their names?”",
        "“Wall, I should say so. I know every Bird that flies and all about it,\nor putty near it,” drawled Sam, with an unusual stretch for him, as he\nwas not given to bragging.",
        "“I wish I did. Can’t I get some eggs to take home?”",
        "“No; Da said if I wouldn’t take any more he’d lend me his Injun Chief\ngun to shoot Rabbits with.”",
        "“What? Are there Rabbits here?”",
        "“Wall, I should say so. I got three last winter.”",
        "“But I mean now,” said Yan, with evident disappointment.",
        "“They ain’t so easy to get at now, but we can try. Some day\nwhen all the work’s done I’ll ask Da for his gun.”",
        "“When all the work’s done,” was a favourite expression of the Raftens\nfor indefinitely shelving a project, it sounded so reasonable and was\nreally so final.",
        "Sam opened up the lower door of the sideboard and got out some flint\narrow-heads picked up in the ploughing, the teeth of a Beaver dating\nfrom the early days of the settlement, and an Owl very badly stuffed.\nThe sight of these precious things set Yan all ablaze. “Oh!” was all\nhe could say. Sam was gratified to see such effect produced by the\nfamily possessions and explained, “Da shot that off’n the barn an’ the\nhired man stuffed it.”",
        "The boys were getting on well together now. They exchanged\nconfidences all day as they met in doing chores. In spite of the long\ninterruptions, they got on so well that Sam said after supper, “Say,\nYan, I’m going to show you something, but you must promise never\nto tell–Swelpye!” Of course Yan promised and added the absolutely\nbinding and ununderstandable word–\"Swelpme.”",
        "“Le’s both go to the barn,” said Sam.",
        "When they were half way he said: “Now I’ll let on I went back\nfor something. You go on an’ round an’ I’ll meet you under the\n’rusty-coat’ in the orchard.” When they met under the big russet apple\ntree, Sam closed one of his melancholy eyes and said in a voice of\nunnecessary hush, “Follow me.” He led to the other end of the orchard\nwhere stood the old log house that had been the home before the\nbuilding of the brick one. It was now used as a tool house. Sam led up\na ladder to the loft (this was all wholly delightful). There at the\nfar end, and next the little gable pane, he again cautioned secrecy,\nthen when on invitation Yan had once more “swelped” himself, he\nrummaged in a dirty old box and drew out a bow, some arrows, a rusty\nsteel trap, an old butcher knife, some fish-hooks, a flint and steel,\na box full of matches, and some dirty, greasy-looking stuff that he\nsaid-was dried meat. “You see,” he explained, “I always wanted to be a\nhunter, and Da was bound I’d be a dentist. Da said there was no money\nin hunting, but one day he had to go to the dentist an’ it cost four\ndollars, an’ the man wasn’t half a day at the job, so he wanted me to\nbe a dentist, but I wanted to be a hunter, an’ one day he licked me\nand Bud (Bud, that’s my brother that died a year ago. If you hear Ma\ntalk you’ll think he was an angel, but I always reckoned he was a\ncrazy galoot, an’ he was the worst boy in school by odds). Wall, Da\nlicked us awful for not feeding the hogs, so Bud got ready to clear\nout, an’ at first I felt just like he did an’ said I’d go too, an’\nwe’d j’ine the Injuns. Anyhow, I’d sure go if ever I was licked again,\nan’ this was the outfit we got together. Bud wanted to steal Da’s gun\nan’ I wouldn’t. I tell you I was hoppin’ mad that time, an’ Bud was\nwuss–but I cooled off an’ talked to Bud. I says, ’Say now, Bud, it\nwould take about a month of travel to get out West, an’ if the Injuns\ndidn’t want nothin’ but our scalps that wouldn’t be no fun, an’ Da\nain’t really so bad, coz we sho’ly did starve them pigs so one of\n’em died.’ I reckon we deserved all we got–anyhow, it was all dumb\nfoolishness about skinnin’ out, though I’d like mighty well to be a\nhunter. Well, Bud died that winter. You seen the biggest coffin plate\non the wall? Well, that’s him. I see Ma lookin’ at it an’ cryin’ the\nother day. Da says he’ll send me to college if I’ll be a dentist or a\nlawyer–lawyers make lots of money: Da had a lawsuit once–an’ if I\ndon’t, he says I kin go to–you know.”",
        "Here was Yan’s own kind of mind, and he opened his heart. He told all\nabout his shanty in the woods and how he had laboured at and loved it.\nHe was full of enthusiasm as of old, boiling over with purpose and\nenergy, and Sam, he realized, had at least two things that he had\nnot–ability with tools and cool judgment. It was like having the best\nparts of his brother Rad put into a real human being. And remembering\nthe joy of his Glen, Yan said:",
        "“Let’s build a shanty in the woods by the creek; your father won’t\ncare, will he?”",
        "“Not he, so long as the work’s done.”",
