        "The pensiveness of a summer evening on the Beau Cheval was like a veil\nhung over all the world.  While yet the sun was shining, there was the\ntremor of life in the sadness; but when the last glint of amethyst and\ngold died away behind Mont Violet, and the melancholy swish of the river\nagainst the osiered banks rose out of the windless dusk, all the region\naround Manor Cartier, with its cypresses, its firs, its beeches, and its\nelms, became gently triste.  Even the weather-vane on the Manor–the gold\nCock of Beaugard, as it was called–did not move; and the stamping of a\nhorse in the stable was like the thunderous knock of a traveller from\nBeyond.  The white mill and the grey manor stood out with ghostly\nvividness in the light of the rising moon.  Yet there were times\ninnumerable when they looked like cool retreats for those who wanted\nrest; when, in the summer solstice, they offered the pleasant peace of\nthe happy fireside.  How often had Jean Jacques stood off from it all of\na summer night and said to himself: “Look at that, my Jean Jacques.  It\nis all yours, Manor and mills and farms and factory–all.”",
        "“Growing, growing, fattening, while I drone in my feather bed,” he had\nas often said, with the delighted observation of the philosopher.  “And\nme but a young man yet–but a mere boy,” he would add.  “I have piled it\nup–I have piled it up, and it keeps on growing, first one thing and then\nanother.”",
        "Could such a man be unhappy?  Finding within himself his satisfaction,\nhis fountain of appeasement, why should not his days be days of\npleasantness and peace?  So it appeared to him during that summer, just\npassed, when he had surveyed the World and his world within the World,\nand it seemed to his innocent mind that he himself had made it all.\nThere he was, not far beyond forty, and eligible to become a member\nof Parliament, or even a count of the Holy Roman Empire!  He had thought\nof both these honours, but there was so much to occupy him–he never had\na moment to himself, except at night; and then there was planning and\naccounting to do, his foremen to see, or some knotty thing to\ndisentangle.  But when the big clock in the Manor struck ten, and he took\nout his great antique silver watch, to see if the two marched to the\nsecond, he would go to the door, look out into the night, say, “All’s\nwell, thank the good God,” and would go to bed, very often forgetting to\nkiss Carmen, and even forgetting his darling little Zoe.",
        "After all, a mind has to be very big and to have very many tentacles to\nhold so many things all at once, and also to remember to do the right\nthing at the right moment every time.  He would even forget to ask Carmen\nto play on the guitar, which in the first days of their married life was\nthe recreation of every evening.  Seldom with the later years had he\nasked her to sing, because he was so busy; and somehow his ear had not\nthat keenness of sound once belonging to it.  There was a time when he\nhimself was wont to sing, when he taught his little Zoe the tunes of the\nChansons Canadiennes; but even that had dropped away, except at rare\nintervals, when he would sing Le Petit Roger Bontemps, with Petite Fleur\nde Bois, and a dozen others; but most he would sing–indeed there was\nnever a sing-song in the Manor Cartier but he would burst forth with A la\nClaire Fontaine and its haunting refrain:",
        "                   “Il y a longtemps que je t’aime,\n                    Jamais je ne t’oublierai.”",
        "But this very summer, when he had sung it on the birthday of the little\nZoe, his voice had seemed out of tune.  At first he had thought that\nCarmen was playing his accompaniment badly on the guitar, but she had\nsharply protested against that, and had appealed to M. Fille, who was\npresent at the pretty festivity.  He had told the truth, as a Clerk of\nthe Court should.  He said that Jean Jacques’ voice was not as he had so\noften heard it; but he would also frankly admit that he did not think\nmadame played the song as he had heard her play it aforetime, and that\ncovered indeed twelve years or more–in fact, since the birth of the\nrenowned Zoe.",
        "M. Fille had wondered much that night of June at the listless manner and\nlistless playing of Carmen Barbille.  For a woman of such spirit and fire\nit would seem as though she must be in ill-health to play like that.  Yet\nwhen he looked at her he saw only the comeliness of a woman whom the life\nof the haut habitant had not destroyed or, indeed, dimmed.  Her skin was\nsmooth, she had no wrinkles, and her neck was a pillar of softly moulded\nwhite flesh, around which a man might well string unset jewels, if he had\nthem; for the tint and purity of her skin would be a better setting than\nplatinum or fine gold.  But the Clerk of the Court was really\nunsophisticated, or he would have seen that Carmen played the guitar\nbadly because she was not interested in Jean Jacques’ singing.  He would\nhave known that she had come to that stage in her married life when the\ntenure is pitifully insecure.  He would have seen that the crisis was\nnear.  If he had had any real observation he would have noticed that\nCarmen’s eyes at once kindled, and that the guitar became a different\nthing, when M. Colombin, the young schoolmaster, one of the guests,\ncaught up the refrain of A la Claire Fontaine, and in a soft tenor voice\nsang it with Jean Jacques to the end, and then sang it again with Zoe.\nThen Carmen’s dark eyes deepened with the gathering light in them, her\nbody seemed to vibrate and thrill with emotion; and when M. Colombin and\nZoe ceased, with her eyes fixed on the distance, and as though\nunconscious of them all, she began to sing a song of Cadiz which she had\nnot sung since boarding the Antoine at Bordeaux.  Her mind had, suddenly\nflown back out of her dark discontent to the days when all life was\nbefore her, and, with her Gonzales, she had moved in an atmosphere of\nromance, adventure and passion.",
        "In a second she was transformed from the wife of the brown money-master\nto the girl she was when she came to St. Saviour’s from the plaza, where\nher Carvillho Gonzales was shot, with love behind her and memory blazoned\nin the red of martyrdom.  She sang now as she had not sung for some\nyears.  Her guitar seemed to leap into life, her face shone with the hot\npassion of memory, her voice rang with the pain of a disappointed life:",
        "              “Granada, Granada, thy gardens are gay,\n               And bright are thy stars, the high stars above;\n               But as flowers that fade and are gray,\n               But as dusk at the end of the day,\n               Are ye to the light in the eyes of my love\n               In the eyes, in the soul, of my love.",
        "              “Granada, Granada, oh, when shall I see\n               My love in thy gardens, there waiting for me?",
        "              “Beloved, beloved, have pity, and make\n               Not the sun shut its eyes, its hot, envious eyes,\n               And the world in the darkness of night\n               Be debtor to thee for its light.\n               Turn thy face, turn thy face from the skies\n               To the love, to the pain in my eyes.",
        "              “Granada, Granada, oh, when shall I see\n               My love in thy gardens, there waiting for me!”",
        "From that night forward she had been restless and petulant and like one\nwatching and waiting.  It seemed to her that she must fly from the life\nwhich was choking her.  It was all so petty and so small.  People went\nabout sneaking into other people’s homes like detectives; they turned\nyellow and grew scrofulous from too much salt pork, green tea, native\ntobacco, and the heat of feather beds.  The making of a rag carpet was an\nevent, the birth of a baby every year till the woman was forty-five was a\ncommonplace; but the exit of a youth to a seminary to become a priest, or\nthe entrance to the novitiate of a young girl, were matters as important\nas a battle to Napoleon the Great.",
        "How had she gone through it all so long, she asked herself?  The presence\nof Jean Jacques had become almost unbearable when, the day done, he\nretired to the feather bed which she loathed, though he would have looked\nupon discarding it like the abdication of his social position.  A feather\nbed was a sign of social position; it was as much the dais to his honour\nas is the woolsack to the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords.",
        "She was waiting for something.  There was a restless, vagrant spirit\nalive in her now.  She had been so long inactive, tied by the leg,\nwith wings clipped; now her mind roamed into pleasant places of the\nimagination where life had freedom, where she could renew the impulses\nof youth.  A true philosopher-a man of the world-would have known for\nwhat she was waiting with that vague, disordered expectancy and yearning;\nbut there was no man of the world to watch and guide her this fateful\nsummer, when things began to go irretrievably wrong.",
        "Then George Masson came.  He was a man of the world in his way; he saw\nand knew better than the philosopher of the Manor Cartier.  He grasped\nthe situation with the mind of an artist in his own sphere, and with the\nknowledge got by experience.  Thus there had been the thing which the\nClerk of the Court saw from Mont Violet behind the Manor; and so it was\nthat as Jean Jacques helped Carmen down from the red wagon on their\nreturn from Vilray, she gave him a smile which was meant to deceive; for\nthough given to him it was really given to another man in her mind’s eye.\nAt sunset she gave it again to George Masson on the river-bank, only\nwarmer and brighter still, with eyes that were burning, with hands that\ntrembled, and with an agitated bosom more delicately ample than it was on\nthe day the Antoine was wrecked.",
        "Neither of these two adventurers into a wild world of feeling noticed\nthat a man was sitting on a little knoll under a tree, not far away from\ntheir meeting-place, busy with pencil and paper.",
        "It was Jean Jacques, who had also come to the river-bank to work out a\nbusiness problem which must be settled on the morrow.  He had stolen out\nimmediately after supper from neighbours who wished to see him, and had\ncome here by a roundabout way, because he wished to be alone.",
        "George Masson and Carmen were together for a few moments only, but Jean\nJacques heard his wife say, “Yes, to-morrow–for sure,” and then he saw\nher kiss the master-carpenter–kiss him twice, thrice.  After which they\nvanished, she in one direction, and the invader and marauder in another.",
        "If either of these two had seen the face of the man with a pencil\nand paper under the spreading beechtree, they would not have been so\nimpatient for tomorrow, and Carmen would not have said “for sure.”",
        "Jean Jacques was awake at last, man as well as philosopher.",
