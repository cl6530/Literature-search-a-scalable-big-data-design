        "Tamerlane was the son of the chief of a Mongolian tribe in Central\nAsia.  His real name was Timour, but as he was lamed in battle\nwhen a youth he was generally called Timour the Lame, and this name\nwas gradually changed to Tamerlane.  He was born in 1333, so that\nhe lived in the time of the English king, Edward III, when the\nBlack Prince was winning his victories over the French.  He was a\ndescendant of a celebrated Tatar soldier, Genghis (jen’-ghis) Khan,\nwho conquered Persia, China, and other countries of Asia.  When\ntwenty-four years old Tamerlane became the head of his tribe, and\nin a few years he made himself the leader of the whole Mongolian\nrace.",
        "He was a tall, stern-looking man, of great strength, and, although\nlame in his right leg, could ride a spirited horse at full gallop\nand do all the work of an active soldier.  He was as brave as a\nlion—and as cruel.",
        "He chose the ancient city of Samarcand (Sa-mar-cand’), in Turkistan\n(Tur-kis-tan’), for his capital; and here he built a beautiful\nmarble palace, where he lived in the greatest luxury.",
        "After he had enjoyed for some time the honors which fell to him as\nchief ruler of the Mongolians, he began to desire further conquests.\nHe determined to make himself master of all the countries of Central\nAsia.",
        "“As there is but one God in heaven,” he said, “there ought to be\nbut one ruler on the earth.”",
        "So he gathered an immense army from all parts of his dominion, and\nfor weeks his subjects were busy making preparations for war.  At\nlength he started for Persia in command of a splendid army.  After\ngaining some brilliant victories he forced the Persian king to flee\nfrom his capital.",
        "All the rich country belonging to Persia, from the Tigris to the\nEuphrates, submitted to the Mongolian conqueror.",
        "Tamerlane celebrated his Persian conquest by magnificent festivities\nwhich continued for a week.  Then orders were given to march into\nthe great Tatar empire of the North.  Here Tamerlane was victorious\nover the principal chiefs and made them his vassals.  In pursuing\nthe Tatars he entered Russia and sacked and burned some of the\nRussian cities.  He did not, however, continue his invasion of this\ncountry, but turned in the direction of India.",
        "At last his army stood before the city of Delhi, and after a fierce\nassault forced it to surrender.  Other cities of India were taken\nand the authority of Tamerlane was established over a large extent\nof the country.",
        "Bajazet (baj-a-zet’), sultan of Turkey, now determined to stop\nTamerlane’s eastward march.",
        "News of this reached the conqueror’s ears.  Leaving India, he\nmarched to meet the sultan.  Bajazet was a famous warrior.  He was\nso rapid in his movements in war that he was called “the lightning.”",
        "Tamerlane entered the sultan’s dominions and devastated them.  He\nstormed Bagdad, and after capturing the place killed thousands of\nthe inhabitants.",
        "At length the rivals and their armies faced each other.  A great\nbattle followed.  It raged four or five hours and then the Turks\nwere totally defeated.  Bajazet was captured.",
        "Tamerlane then ordered a great iron cage to be made and forced the\nsultan to enter it.  The prisoner was chained to the iron bars of\nthe cage and was thus exhibited to the Mongol soldiers, who taunted\nhim as he was carried along the lines.",
        "As the army marched from place to place the sultan in his cage was\nshown to the people.  How long the fallen monarch had to bear this\nhumiliating punishment is not known.",
        "Tamerlane’s dominions now embraced a large part of Asia.  He\nretired to his palace at Samarcand and for several weeks indulged\nin festivities.",
        "He could not, however, long be content away from the field of\nbattle.  So he made up his mind to invade the Empire of China.  At\nthe head of a great army of two hundred thousand soldiers he marched\nfrom the city of Samarcand towards China.  He had gone about three\nhundred miles on the way when, in February, 1405, he was taken\nsick and died.  His army was disbanded and all thought of invading\nChina was given up.",
        "Thus passed away one of the greatest conquerors of the Middle Ages.\nHe was a soldier of genius but he cannot be called a truly great\nman.  His vast empire speedily fell to pieces after his death.  Since\nhis day there has been no leader like him in that part of Asia.",
