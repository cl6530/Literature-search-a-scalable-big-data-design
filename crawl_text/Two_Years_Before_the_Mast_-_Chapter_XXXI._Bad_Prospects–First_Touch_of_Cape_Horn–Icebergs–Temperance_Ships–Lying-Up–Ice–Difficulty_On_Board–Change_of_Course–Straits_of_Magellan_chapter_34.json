        "There now began to be a decided change in the appearance of things.\nThe days became shorter and shorter; the sun running lower in its\ncourse each day, and giving less and less heat; and the nights so\ncold as to prevent our sleeping on deck; the Magellan Clouds in\nsight, of a clear night; the skies looking cold and angry; and,\nat times, a long, heavy, ugly sea, setting in from the southwards\ntold us what we were coming to.  Still, however, we had a fine,\nstrong breeze, and kept on our way, under as much sail as our\nship would bear.  Toward the middle of the week, the wind hauled\nto the southward, which brought us upon a taught bowline, made the\nship meet, nearly head on, the heavy swell which rolled from that\ndirection; and there was something not at all encouraging in the\nmanner in which she met it.  Being so deep and heavy, she wanted\nthe buoyancy which should have carried her over the seas, and she\ndropped heavily into them, the water washing over the decks; and\nevery now and then, when an unusually large sea met her fairly\nupon the bows, she struck it with a sound as dead and heavy as\nthat with which a sledge-hammer falls upon the pile, and took\nthe whole of it in upon the forecastle, and rising, carried it\naft in the scuppers, washing the rigging off the pins, and carrying\nalong with it everything which was loose on deck.  She had been\nacting in this way all of our forenoon watch below; as we could\ntell by the washing of the water over our heads, and the heavy\nbreaking of the seas against her bows, (with a sound as though\nshe were striking against a rock,) only the thickness of the\nplank from our heads, as we lay in our berths, which are directly\nagainst the bows.  At eight bells, the watch was called, and we\ncame on deck, one hand going aft to take the wheel, and another\ngoing to the galley to get the grub for dinner.  I stood on the\nforecastle, looking at the seas, which were rolling high, as far\nas the eye could reach, their tops white with foam, and the body\nof them of a deep indigo blue, reflecting the bright rays of the\nsun.  Our ship rose slowly over a few of the largest of them,\nuntil one immense fellow came rolling on, threatening to cover\nher, and which I was sailor enough to know, by “the feeling of\nher” under my feet, she would not rise over.  I sprang upon the\nknight-heads, and seizing hold of the fore-stay with my hands,\ndrew myself upon it.  My feet were just off the stanchion, when\nshe struck fairly into the middle of the sea, and it washed her\nfore and aft, burying her in the water.  As soon as she rose out\nof it, I looked aft, and everything forward of the main-mast,\nexcept the long-boat, which was griped and double-lashed down\nto the ring-bolts, was swept off clear.  The galley, the pig-sty,\nthe hen-coop, and a large sheep-pen which had been built upon the\nforehatch, were all gone, in the twinkling of an eye–leaving the\ndeck as clean as a chin new-reaped–and not a stick left, to show\nwhere they had stood.  In the scuppers lay the galley, bottom up,\nand a few boards floating about, the wreck of the sheep-pen,–and\nhalf a dozen miserable sheep floating among them, wet through,\nand not a little frightened at the sudden change that had come\nupon them.  As soon as the sea had washed by, all hands sprung\nout of the forecastle to see what had become of the ship and in\na few moments the cook and old Bill crawled out from under the\ngalley, where they had been lying in the water, nearly smothered,\nwith the galley over them.  Fortunately, it rested against the\nbulwarks, or it would have broken some of their bones.  When the\nwater ran off, we picked the sheep up, and put them in the long-\nboat, got the galley back in its place, and set things a little\nto rights; but, had not our ship had uncommonly high bulwarks and\nrail, everything must have been washed overboard, not excepting\nOld Bill and the cook.",
        "Bill had been standing at the galley-door, with the kid of beef in his\nhand for the forecastle mess, when, away he went, kid, beef, and all.\nHe held on to the kid till the last, like a good fellow, but the beef\nwas gone, and when the water had run off, we saw it lying high and dry,\nlike a rock at low tide–nothing could hurt that.  We took the loss\nof our beef very easily, consoling ourselves with the recollection\nthat the cabin had more to lose than we; and chuckled not a little\nat seeing the remains of the chicken-pie and pan-cakes floating in\nthe scuppers.  “This will never do!” was what some said, and every\none felt.  Here we were, not yet within a thousand miles of the\nlatitude of Cape Horn, and our decks swept by a sea not one half\nso high as we must expect to find there.  Some blamed the captain\nfor loading his ship so deep, when he knew what he must expect;\nwhile others said that the wind was always southwest, off the Cape,\nin the winter; and that, running before it, we should not mind the\nseas so much.  When we got down into the forecastle, Old Bill, who\nwas somewhat of a croaker,–having met with a great many accidents\nat sea–said that if that was the way she was going to act, we might\nas well make our wills, and balance the books at once, and put on\na clean shirt.  “’Vast there, you bloody old owl!  You’re always\nhanging out blue lights!  You’re frightened by the ducking you got\nin the scuppers, and can’t take a joke!  What’s the use in being\nalways on the look-out for Davy Jones?”  “Stand by!” says another,\n“and we’ll get an afternoon watch below, by this scrape;” but in\nthis they were disappointed, for at two bells, all hands were\ncalled and set to work, getting lashings upon everything on deck;\nand the captain talked of sending down the long top-gallant masts;\nbut, as the sea went down toward night, and the wind hauled abeam,\nwe left them standing, and set the studding-sails. ",
        "The next day, all hands were turned-to upon unbending the old\nsails, and getting up the new ones; for a ship, unlike people\non shore, puts on her best suit in bad weather.  The old sails\nwere sent down, and three new topsails, and new fore and main\ncourses, jib, and fore-topmast staysail, which were made on\nthe coast, and never had been used, were bent, with a complete\nset of new earings, robands and reef-points; and reef-tackles\nwere rove to the courses, and spilling-lines to the top-sails.\nThese, with new braces and clew-lines, fore and aft, gave us a\ngood suit of running rigging.",
        "The wind continued westerly, and the weather and sea less rough\nsince the day on which we shipped the heavy sea, and we were\nmaking great progress under studding-sails, with our light sails\nall set, keeping a little to the eastward of south; for the captain,\ndepending upon westerly winds off the Cape, had kept so far to the\nwestward, that though we were within about five hundred miles of\nthe latitude of Cape Horn, we were nearly seventeen hundred miles\nto the westward of it.  Through the rest of the week, we continued\non with a fair wind, gradually, as we got more to the southward,\nkeeping a more easterly course, and bringing the wind on our\nlarboard quarter, until–",
        "Sunday, June 26th, when, having a fine, clear day, the captain\ngot a lunar observation, as well as his meridian altitude, which\nmade us in lat. 47° 50’ S., long. 113° 49’ W.; Cape Horn bearing,\naccording to my calculation, E. S. E. 1/2 E., and distant eighteen\nhundred miles.",
        "Monday, June 27th.  During the first part of this day, the wind\ncontinued fair, and, as we were going before it, it did not feel\nvery cold, so that we kept at work on deck, in our common clothes\nand round jackets.  Our watch had an afternoon watch below, for the\nfirst time since leaving San Diego, and having inquired of the third\nmate what the latitude was at noon, and made our usual guesses as\nto the time she would need, to be up with the Horn, we turned-\nin, for a nap.  We were sleeping away “at the rates of knots,\"\nwhen three knocks on the scuttle, and “All hands ahoy!” started\nus from our berths.  What could be the matter?  It did not appear\nto be blowing hard, and looking up through the scuttle, we could\nsee that it was a clear day, overhead; yet the watch were taking\nin sail.",
        "We thought there must be a sail in sight, and that we were about\nto heave-to and speak her; and were just congratulating ourselves\nupon it–for we had seen neither sail nor land since we had\nleft port–when we heard the mate’s voice on deck, (he turned-in\n“all standing,” and was always on deck the moment he was called,)\nsinging out to the men who were taking in the studding-sails, and\nasking where his watch were.  We did not wait for a second call,\nbut tumbled up the ladder; and there, on the starboard bow, was a\nbank of mist, covering sea and sky, and driving directly for us.\nI had seen the same before, in my passage round in the Pilgrim,\nand knew what it meant, and that there was no time to be lost.\nWe had nothing on but thin clothes, yet there was not a moment\nto spare, and at it we went.",
        "The boys of the other watch were in the tops, taking in the top-\ngallant studding-sails, and the lower and topmast studding-sails\nwere coming down by the run.  It was nothing but “haul down and\nclew up,” until we got all the studding-sails in, and the royals,\nflying-jib, and mizen top-gallant sail furled, and the ship kept\noff a little, to take the squall.  The fore and main top-gallant\nsails were still on her, for the “old man” did not mean to be\nfrightened in broad daylight, and was determined to carry sail\ntill the last minute.",
        "We all stood waiting for its coming, when the first blast showed\nus that it was not be trifled with.  Rain, sleet, snow, and wind,\nenough to take our breath from us, and make the toughest turn his\nback to windward!  The ship lay nearly over on her beam-ends; the\nspars and rigging snapped and cracked; and her top-gallant masts\nbent like whip-sticks.  “Clew up the fore and main top-gallant\nsails!” shouted the captain, and all hands sprang to the clewlines.\nThe decks were standing nearly at an angle of forty-five degrees,\nand the ship going like a mad steed through the water, the whole\nforward part of her in a smother of foam.  The halyards were let\ngo and the yard clewed down, and the sheets started, and in a few\nminutes the sails smothered and kept in by clewlines and buntlines.\n–\"Furl ’em, sir?” asked the mate.–\"Let go the topsail halyards,\nfore and aft!” shouted the captain, in answer, at the top of his voice. \nDown came the topsail yards, the reef-tackles were manned and\nhauled out, and we climbed up to windward, and sprang into the\nweather rigging.  The violence of the wind, and the hail and sleet,\ndriving nearly horizontally across the ocean, seemed actually\nto pin us down to the rigging.  It was hard work making head\nagainst them.  One after another, we got out upon the yards.\nAnd here we had work to do; for our new sails, which had hardly\nbeen bent long enough to get the starch out of them, were as stiff\nas boards, and the new earings and reef-points, stiffened with the\nsleet, knotted like pieces of iron wire.  Having only our round\njackets and straw hats on, we were soon wet through, and it was\nevery moment growing colder.  Our hands were soon stiffened and\nnumbed, which, added to the stiffness of everything else, kept us\na good while on the yard.  After we had got the sail hauled upon\nthe yard, we had to wait a long time for the weather earing to\nbe passed; but there was no fault to be found, for French John\nwas at the earing, and a better sailor never laid out on a yard;\nso we leaned over the yard, and beat our hands upon the sail to\nkeep them from freezing.  At length the word came–\"Haul out\nto leeward,\"–and we seized the reef-points and hauled the band\ntaught for the lee earing.  “Taught band–Knot away,” and we got\nthe first reef fast, and were just going to lay down, when–\"Two\nreefs–two reefs!” shouted the mate, and we had a second reef to\ntake, in the same way.  When this was fast, we laid down on deck,\nmanned the halyards to leeward, nearly up to our knees in water,\nset the topsail, and then laid aloft on the main topsail yard,\nand reefed that sail in the same manner; for, as I have before\nstated, we were a good deal reduced in numbers, and, to make\nit worse, the carpenter, only two days before, cut his leg with\nan axe, so that he could not go aloft.  This weakened us so that\nwe could not well manage more than one topsail at a time, in such\nweather as this, and, of course, our labor was doubled.  From the\nmain topsail yard, we went upon the main yard, and took a reef in\nthe mainsail.  No sooner had we got on deck, than–\"Lay aloft there,\nmizen-top-men, and close-reef the mizen topsail!”  This called me;\nand being nearest to the rigging, I got first aloft, and out to\nthe weather earing.  English Ben was on the yard just after me,\nand took the lee earing, and the rest of our gang were soon on\nthe yard, and began to fist the sail, when the mate considerately\nsent up the cook and steward, to help us.  I could now account\nfor the long time it took to pass the other earings, for, to do\nmy best, with a strong hand to help me at the dog’s ear, I could\nnot get it passed until I heard them beginning to complain in the\nbunt.  One reef after another we took in, until the sail was close-\nreefed, when we went down and hoisted away at the halyards.  In the\nmean time, the jib had been furled and the staysail set, and the\nship, under her reduced sail, had got more upright and was under\nmanagement; but the two top-gallant sails were still hanging in\nthe buntlines, and slatting and jerking as though they would take\nthe masts out of her.  We gave a look aloft, and knew that our work\nwas not done yet; and, sure enough, no sooner did the mate see that\nwe were on deck, than–\"Lay aloft there, four of you, and furl the\ntop-gallant sails!” This called me again, and two of us went aloft,\nup the fore rigging, and two more up the main, upon the top-gallant\nyards.",
        "The shrouds were now iced over, the sleet having formed a crust\nor cake round all the standing rigging, and on the weather side\nof the masts and yards.  When we got upon the yard, my hands were\nso numb that I could not have cast off the knot of the gasket to\nhave saved my life.  We both lay over the yard for a few seconds,\nbeating our hands upon the sail, until we started the blood into\nour fingers’ ends, and at the next moment our hands were in a\nburning heat.  My companion on the yard was a lad, who came out\nin the ship a weak, puny boy, from one of the Boston schools,–\n“no larger than a spritsail sheet knot,” nor “heavier than a\npaper of lamp-black,” and “not strong enough to haul a shad\noff a gridiron,” but who was now “as long as a spare topmast,\nstrong enough to knock down an ox, and hearty enough to eat him.\"\nWe fisted the sail together, and after six or eight minutes of hard\nhauling and pulling and beating down the sail, which was as stiff\nas sheet iron, we managed to get it furled; and snugly furled it\nmust be, for we knew the mate well enough to be certain that if\nit got adrift again, we should be called up from our watch below,\nat any hour of the night, to furl it.",
        "I had been on the look-out for a moment to jump below and clap on\na thick jacket and south-wester; but when we got on deck we found\nthat eight bells had been struck, and the other watch gone below,\nso that there were two hours of dog watch for us, and a plenty of\nwork to do.  It had now set in for a steady gale from the south-west;\nbut we were not yet far enough to the southward to make a fair wind\nof it, for we must give Terra del Fuego a wide berth.  The decks\nwere covered with snow, and there was a constant driving of sleet.\nIn fact, Cape Horn had set in with good earnest.  In the midst of\nall this, and before it became dark, we had all the studding-sails\nto make up and stow away, and then to lay aloft and rig in all the\nbooms, fore and aft, and coil away the tacks, sheets, and halyards.\nThis was pretty tough work for four or five hands, in the face of\na gale which almost took us off the yards, and with ropes so stiff\nwith ice that it was almost impossible to bend them.  I was nearly\nhalf an hour out on the end of the fore yard, trying to coil away\nand stop down the topmast studding-sail tack and lower halyards.\nIt was after dark when we got through, and we were not a little\npleased to hear four bells struck, which sent us below for two\nhours, and gave us each a pot of hot tea with our cold beef and\nbread, and, what was better yet, a suit of thick, dry clothing,\nfitted for the weather, in place of our thin clothes, which were\nwet through and now frozen stiff.",
        "This sudden turn, for which we were so little prepared, was as\nunacceptable to me as to any of the rest; for I had been troubled\nfor several days with a slight tooth-ache, and this cold weather,\nand wetting and freezing, were not the best things in the world\nfor it.",
        "I soon found that it was getting strong hold, and running over all\nparts of my face; and before the watch was out I went aft to the\nmate, who had charge of the medicine-chest, to get something for it. ",
        "But the chest showed like the end of a long voyage, for there was\nnothing that would answer but a few drops of laudanum, which must\nbe saved for any emergency; so I had only to bear the pain as well\nas I could.",
        "When we went on deck at eight bells, it had stopped snowing, and\nthere were a few stars out, but the clouds were still black, and it\nwas blowing a steady gale.  Just before midnight, I went aloft and\nsent down the mizen royal yard, and had the good luck to do it to\nthe satisfaction of the mate, who said it was done “out of hand\nand ship-shape.”  The next four hours below were but little relief\nto me, for I lay awake in my berth, the whole time, from the pain\nin my face, and heard every bell strike, and, at four o’clock,\nturned out with the watch, feeling little spirit for the hard\nduties of the day.",
        "Bad weather and hard work at sea can be borne up against very\nwell, if one only has spirit and health; but there is nothing\nbrings a man down, at such a time, like bodily pain and want\nof sleep.",
        "There was, however, too much to do to allow time to think;\nfor the gale of yesterday, and the heavy seas we met with a\nfew days before, while we had yet ten degrees more southing to\nmake, had convinced the captain that we had something before us\nwhich was not to be trifled with, and orders were given to send\ndown the long top-gallant masts.  The top-gallant and royal yards\nwere accordingly struck, the flying jib-boom rigged in, and the\ntop-gallant masts sent down on deck, and all lashed together by\nthe side of the long-boat.",
        "The rigging was then sent down and coiled away below, and everything\nwas made snug aloft.  There was not a sailor in the ship who was not\nrejoiced to see these sticks come down; for, so long as the yards\nwere aloft, on the least sign of a lull, the top-gallant sails were\nloosed, and then we had to furl them again in a snow-squall, and shin\nup and down single ropes caked with ice, and send royal yards down in\nthe teeth of a gale coming right from the south pole.  It was an\ninteresting sight, too, to see our noble ship, dismantled of all\nher top-hamper of long tapering masts and yards, and boom pointed\nwith spear-head, which ornamented her in port; and all that canvas,\nwhich a few days before had covered her like a cloud, from the\ntruck to the water’s edge, spreading far out beyond her hull on\neither side, now gone; and she, stripped, like a wrestler for\nthe fight.  It corresponded, too, with the desolate character\nof her situation;–alone, as she was, battling with storms,\nwind, and ice, at this extremity of the globe, and in almost\nconstant night.",
        "Friday, July 1st.  We were now nearly up to the latitude of Cape\nHorn, and having over forty degrees of easting to make, we squared\naway the yards before a strong westerly gale, shook a reef out of the\nfore-topsail, and stood on our way, east-by-south, with the prospect\nof being up with the Cape in a week or ten days.  As for myself,\nI had had no sleep for forty-eight hours; and the want of rest,\ntogether with constant wet and cold, had increased the swelling,\nso that my face was nearly as large as two, and I found it impossible\nto get my mouth open wide enough to eat.  In this state, the steward\napplied to the captain for some rice to boil for me, but he only\ngot a–\"No! d–- you! Tell him to eat salt junk and hard bread,\nlike the rest of them.”  For this, of course, I was much obliged\nto him, and in truth it was just what I expected.  However, I did\nnot starve, for the mate, who was a man as well as a sailor, and\nhad always been a good friend to me, smuggled a pan of rice into\nthe galley, and told the cook to boil it for me, and not let the\n“old man” see it.  Had it been fine weather, or in port, I should\nhave gone below and lain by until my face got well; but in such\nweather as this, and short-handed as we were, it was not for me\nto desert my post; so I kept on deck, and stood my watch and did\nmy duty as well as I could.",
        "Saturday, July 2nd.  This day the sun rose fair, but it ran too\nlow in the heavens to give any heat, or thaw out our sails and\nrigging; yet the sight of it was pleasant; and we had a steady\n“reef topsail breeze” from the westward.  The atmosphere, which had\npreviously been clear and cold, for the last few hours grew damp,\nand had a disagreeable, wet chilliness in it; and the man who came\nfrom the wheel said he heard the captain tell “the passenger” that\nthe thermometer had fallen several degrees since morning, which he\ncould not account for in any other way than by supposing that there\nmust be ice near us; though such a thing had never been heard of\nin this latitude, at this season of the year.  At twelve o’clock\nwe went below, and had just got through dinner, when the cook put\nhis head down the scuttle and told us to come on deck and see the\nfinest sight that we had ever seen.  “Where away, cook?” asked\nthe first man who was up.  “On the larboard bow.”  And there lay,\nfloating in the ocean, several miles off, an immense, irregular mass,\nits top and points covered with snow, and its center of a deep indigo\ncolor.",
        "This was an iceberg, and of the largest size, as one of our men said\nwho had been in the Northern ocean.  As far as the eye could reach,\nthe sea in every direction was of a deep blue color, the waves\nrunning high and fresh, and sparkling in the light, and in the\nmidst lay this immense mountain-island, its cavities and valleys\nthrown into deep shade, and its points and pinnacles glittering\nin the sun.",
        "All hands were soon on deck, looking at it, and admiring in various\nways its beauty and grandeur.  But no description can give any idea\nof the strangeness, splendor, and, really, the sublimity, of the sight. ",
        "Its great size;–for it must have been from two to three miles\nin circumference, and several hundred feet in height;–its\nslow motion, as its base rose and sank in the water, and its\nhigh points nodded against the clouds; the dashing of the waves\nupon it, which, breaking high with foam, lined its base with\na white crust; and the thundering sound of the cracking of\nthe mass, and the breaking and tumbling down of huge pieces;\ntogether with its nearness and approach, which added a slight\nelement of fear,–all combined to give to it the character of\ntrue sublimity.  The main body of the mass was, as I have said,\nof an indigo color, its base crusted with frozen foam; and as it\ngrew thin and transparent toward the edges and top, its color\nshaded off from a deep blue to the whiteness of snow.",
        "It seemed to be drifting slowly toward the north, so that we kept\naway and avoided it.  It was in sight all the afternoon; and when we\ngot to leeward of it, the wind died away, so that we lay-to quite\nnear it for a greater part of the night.  Unfortunately, there was\nno moon, but it was a clear night, and we could plainly mark the\nlong, regular heaving of the stupendous mass, as its edges moved\nslowly against the stars.  Several times in our watch loud cracks\nwere heard, which sounded as though they must have run through the\nwhole length of the iceberg, and several pieces fell down with a\nthundering crash, plunging heavily into the sea.  Toward morning,\na strong breeze sprang up, and we filled away, and left it astern,\nand at daylight it was out of sight.  The next day, which was",
        "Sunday, July 3d, the breeze continued strong, the air exceedingly\nchilly, and the thermometer low.  In the course of the day we saw\nseveral icebergs, of different sizes, but none so near as the\none which we saw the day before.  Some of them, as well as we\ncould judge, at the distance at which we were, must have been\nas large as that, if not larger.  At noon we were in latitude\n55° 12’ south, and supposed longitude 89° 5’ west.  Toward night\nthe wind hauled to the southward, and headed us off our course\na little, and blew a tremendous gale; but this we did not mind,\nas there was no rain nor snow, and we were already under close\nsail.",
        "Monday, July 4th.  This was “independence day” in Boston.\nWhat firing of guns, and ringing of bells, and rejoicings of\nall sorts, in every part of our country!  The ladies (who have\nnot gone down to Nahant, for a breath of cool air, and sight of\nthe ocean) walking the streets with parasols over their heads,\nand the dandies in their white pantaloons and silk stockings!\nWhat quantities of ice-cream have been eaten, and what quantities\nof ice brought into the city from a distance, and sold out by the\nlump and the pound!  The smallest of the islands which we saw\ntoday would have made the fortune of poor Jack, if he had had it\nin Boston; and I dare say he would have had no objection to being\nthere with it.  This, to be sure, was no place to keep the fourth\nof July.  To keep ourselves warm, and the ship out of the ice,\nwas as much as we could do.  Yet no one forgot the day; and many\nwere the wishes, and conjectures, and comparisons, both serious and\nludicrous, which were made among all hands.  The sun shone bright\nas long as it was up, only that a scud of black clouds was ever\nand anon driving across it.  At noon we were in lat. 54° 27’ S.,\nand long. 85° 5’ W., having made a good deal of easting, but having\nlost in our latitude by the heading of the wind.  Between daylight\nand dark–that is, between nine o’clock and three–we saw thirty-\nfour ice islands, of various sizes; some no bigger than the hull\nof our vessel, and others apparently nearly as large as the one\nthat we first saw; though, as we went on, the islands became\nsmaller and more numerous; and, at sundown of this day, a man at\nthe mast-head saw large fields of floating ice called “field-ice\"\nat the south-east.  This kind of ice is much more dangerous than\nthe large islands, for those can be seen at a distance, and kept\naway from; but the field-ice, floating in great quantities, and\ncovering the ocean for miles and miles, in pieces of every size-\n-large, flat, and broken cakes, with here and there an island\nrising twenty and thirty feet, and as large as the ship’s hull;–\nthis, it is very difficult to sheer clear of.  A constant look-out\nwas necessary; for any of these pieces, coming with the heave\nof the sea, were large enough to have knocked a hole in the ship,\nand that would have been the end of us; for no boat (even if we\ncould have got one out) could have lived in such a sea; and no man\ncould have lived in a boat in such weather.  To make our condition\nstill worse, the wind came out due east, just after sundown, and it\nblew a gale dead ahead, with hail and sleet, and a thick fog, so that\nwe could not see half the length of the ship.  Our chief reliance,\nthe prevailing westerly gales, was thus cut off; and here we were,\nnearly seven hundred miles to the westward of the Cape, with a gale\ndead from the eastward, and the weather so thick that we could not\nsee the ice with which we were surrounded, until it was directly\nunder our bows.",
        "At four, P. M. (it was then quite dark) all hands were called, and sent\naloft in a violent squall of hail and rain, to take in sail.  We had\nnow all got on our “Cape Horn rig\"–thick boots, south-westers coming\ndown over our neck and ears, thick trowsers and jackets, and some with\noil-cloth suits over all.  Mittens, too, we wore on deck, but it would\nnot do to go aloft with them on, for it was impossible to work with\nthem, and, being wet and stiff, they might let a man slip overboard,\nfor all the hold he could get upon a rope; so, we were obliged to\nwork with bare hands, which, as well as our faces, were often cut\nwith the hail-stones, which fell thick and large.  Our ship was\nnow all cased with ice,–hull, spars, and standing rigging;–and\nthe running rigging so stiff that we could hardly bend it so as\nto belay it, or, still worse, take a knot with it; and the sails\nnearly as stiff as sheet iron.  One at a time, (for it was a long\npiece of work and required many hands,) we furled the courses,\nmizen topsail, and fore-topmast staysail, and close-reefed the\nfore and main topsails, and hove the ship to under the fore,\nwith the main hauled up by the clewlines and buntlines, and ready\nto be sheeted home, if we found it necessary to make sail to get\nto windward of an ice island.  A regular look-out was then set,\nand kept by each watch in turn, until the morning.  It was a tedious\nand anxious night.  It blew hard the whole time, and there was an\nalmost constant driving of either rain, hail, or snow.  In addition\nto this, it was “as thick as muck,” and the ice was all about us.\nThe captain was on deck nearly the whole night, and kept the\ncook in the galley, with a roaring fire, to make coffee for him,\nwhich he took every few hours, and once or twice gave a little to\nhis officers; but not a drop of anything was there for the crew.\nThe captain, who sleeps all the daytime, and comes and goes at\nnight as he chooses, can have his brandy and water in the cabin,\nand his hot coffee at the galley; while Jack, who has to stand\nthrough everything, and work in wet and cold, can have nothing\nto wet his lips or warm his stomach.",
        "This was a “temperance ship,” and, like too many such ships, the\ntemperance was all in the forecastle.  The sailor, who only takes\nhis one glass as it is dealt out to him, is in danger of being drunk;\nwhile the captain, who has all under his hand, and can drink as much\nas he chooses, and upon whose self-possession and cool judgment the\nlives of all depend, may be trusted with any amount, to drink at\nhis will.  Sailors will never be convinced that rum is a dangerous\nthing, by taking it away from them, and giving it to the officers;\nnor that, that temperance is their friend, which takes from them\nwhat they have always had, and gives them nothing in the place of\nit.  By seeing it allowed to their officers, they will not be\nconvinced that it is taken from them for their good; and by\nreceiving nothing in its place, they will not believe that\nit is done in kindness.  On the contrary, many of them look\nupon the change as a new instrument of tyranny.  Not that\nthey prefer rum. I never knew a sailor, in my life, who would\nnot prefer a pot of hot coffee or chocolate, in a cold night,\nto all the rum afloat. They all say that rum only warms them for\na time; yet, if they can get nothing better, they will miss what\nthey have lost. The momentary warmth and glow from drinking it;\nthe break and change which is made in a long, dreary watch by\nthe mere calling all hands aft and serving of it out; and the\nsimply having some event to look forward to, and to talk about;\ngive it an importance and a use which no one can appreciate who\nhas not stood his watch before the mast. On my passage round Cape\nHorn before, the vessel that I was in was not under temperance\narticles, and grog was served out every middle and morning watch,\nand after every reefing of topsails; and though I had never drank\nrum before, and never intend to again, I took my allowance then\nat the capstan, as the rest did, merely for the momentary warmth\nit gave the system, and the change in our feelings and aspect of\nour duties on the watch.  At the same time, as I have stated,\nthere was not a man on board who would not have pitched the rum\nto the dogs, (I have heard them say so, a dozen times) for a\npot of coffee or chocolate; or even for our common beverage–\n“water bewitched, and tea begrudged,” as it was.(1)",
        "–––––––-\n1.  The proportions of the ingredients of the tea that was made for\nus (and ours, as I have before stated, was a favorable specimen of\nAmerican merchantmen) were, a pint of tea, and a pint and a half\nof molasses, to about three gallons of water.",
        "These are all boiled down together in the “coppers,” and before\nserving it out, the mess is stirred up with a stick, so as to give\neach man his fair share of sweetening and tea-leaves.  The tea\nfor the cabin is, of course, made in the usual way, in a tea-pot,\nand drank with sugar.\n–––––––-",
        "The temperance reform is the best thing that ever was undertaken\nfor the sailor; but when the grog is taken from him, he ought to\nhave something in its place.  As it is now, in most vessels, it is a\nmere saving to the owners; and this accounts for the sudden increase\nof temperance ships, which surprised even the best friends of the\ncause.  If every merchant, when he struck grog from the list of\nthe expenses of his ship, had been obliged to substitute as much\ncoffee, or chocolate, as would give each man a pot-full when he\ncame off the topsail yard, on a stormy night;–I fear Jack might\nhave gone to ruin on the old road.(2)  But this is not doubling",
        "–––––––-\n(2) I do not wish these remarks, so far as they relate to the\nsaving of expense in the outfit, to be applied to the owners\nof our ship, for she was supplied with an abundance of stores,\nof the best kind that are given to seamen;, though the dispensing\nof them is necessarily left to the captain, Indeed, so high was\nthe reputation of “the employ” among men and officers, for the\ncharacter and outfit of their vessels, and for their liberality\nin conducting their voyages, that when it was known that they had\na ship fitting out for a long voyage, and that hands were to be\nshipped at a certain time,–a half hour before the time, as one of\nthe crew told me, numbers of sailors were steering down the wharf,\nhopping over the barrels, like flocks of sheep.\n–––––––-",
        "Cape Horn.  Eight hours of the night, our watch was on deck, and\nduring the whole of that time we kept a bright look-out: one man\non each bow, another in the bunt of the fore yard, the third mate\non the scuttle, one on each quarter, and a man always standing by\nthe wheel.  The chief mate was everywhere, and commanded the ship\nwhen the captain was below.",
        "When a large piece of ice was seen in our way, or drifting near us,\nthe word was passed along, and the ship’s head turned one way and\nanother; and sometimes the yards squared or braced up.  There was\nlittle else to do than to look out; and we had the sharpest eyes in\nthe ship on the forecastle.  The only variety was the monotonous\nvoice of the look-out forward–\"Another island!\"–\"Ice ahead!\"–\n“Ice on the lee bow!\"–\"Hard up the helm!\"–\"Keep her off a\nlittle!\"–\"Stead-y!”",
        "In the meantime, the wet and cold had brought my face into such\na state that I could neither eat nor sleep; and though I stood it\nout all night, yet, when it became light, I was in such a state,\nthat all hands told me I must go below, and lie-by for a day or\ntwo, or I should be laid up for a long time, and perhaps have the\nlock-jaw.",
        "When the watch was changed I went into the steerage, and took off\nmy hat and comforter, and showed my face to the mate, who told me\nto go below at once, and stay in my berth until the swelling went\ndown, and gave the cook orders to make a poultice for me, and said\nhe would speak to the captain.",
        "I went below and turned-in, covering myself over with blankets\nand jackets, and lay in my berth nearly twenty-four hours, half\nasleep and half awake, stupid, from the dull pain.  I heard the\nwatch called, and the men going up and down, and sometimes a\nnoise on deck, and a cry of “ice,” but I gave little attention\nto anything.  At the end of twenty-four hours the pain went down,\nand I had a long sleep, which brought me back to my proper state;\nyet my face was so swollen and tender, that I was obliged to keep\nto my berth for two or three days longer.  During the two days I\nhad been below, the weather was much the same that it had been,\nhead winds, and snow and rain; or, if the wind came fair, too foggy,\nand the ice too thick, to run.  At the end of the third day the ice\nwas very thick; a complete fog-bank covered the ship.  It blew a\ntremendous gale from the eastward, with sleet and snow, and there\nwas every promise of a dangerous and fatiguing night.  At dark,\nthe captain called all hands aft, and told them that not a man was\nto leave the deck that night; that the ship was in the greatest\ndanger; any cake of ice might knock a hole in her, or she might\nrun on an island and go to pieces.  No one could tell whether she\nwould be a ship the next morning.  The look-outs were then set,\nand every man was put in his station.  When I heard what was the\nstate of things, I began to put on my clothes to stand it out\nwith the rest of them, when the mate came below, and looking at\nmy face, ordered me back to my berth, saying that if we went down,\nwe should all go down together, but if I went on deck I might lay\nmyself up for life.  This was the first word I had heard from aft;\nfor the captain had done nothing, nor inquired how I was, since I\nwent below.",
        "In obedience to the mate’s orders, I went back to my berth; but a\nmore miserable night I never wish to spend.  I never felt the curse\nof sickness so keenly in my life.  If I could only have been on deck\nwith the rest, where something was to be done, and seen, and heard;\nwhere there were fellow-beings for companions in duty and danger–but\nto be cooped up alone in a black hole, in equal danger, but without the\npower to do, was the hardest trial.  Several times, in the course of\nthe night, I got up, determined to go on deck; but the silence which\nshowed that there was nothing doing, and the knowledge that I might\nmake myself seriously ill, for nothing, kept me back.  It was not\neasy to sleep, lying, as I did, with my head directly against the\nbows, which might be dashed in by an island of ice, brought down\nby the very next sea that struck her.  This was the only time I\nhad been ill since I left Boston, and it was the worst time it\ncould have happened.  I felt almost willing to bear the plagues\nof Egypt for the rest of the voyage, if I could but be well and\nstrong for that one night.  Yet it was a dreadful night for those\non deck.",
        "A watch of eighteen hours, with wet, and cold, and constant anxiety,\nnearly wore them out; and when they came below at nine o’clock for\nbreakfast, they almost dropped asleep on their chests, and some\nof them were so stiff that they could with difficulty sit down.\nNot a drop of anything had been given them during the whole time,\n(though the captain, as on the night that I was on deck, had his\ncoffee every four hours,) except that the mate stole a potful of\ncoffee for two men to drink behind the galley, while he kept a\nlook-out for the captain.  Every man had his station, and was not\nallowed to leave it; and nothing happened to break the monotony\nof the night, except once setting the main topsails to run clear\nof a large island to leeward, which they were drifting fast upon.\nSome of the boys got so sleepy and stupefied, that they actually\nfell asleep at their posts; and the young third mate, whose station\nwas the exposed one of standing on the fore scuttle, was so stiff,\nwhen he was relieved, that he could not bend his knees to get down.\nBy a constant look-out, and a quick shifting of the helm, as the\nislands and pieces came in sight, the ship went clear of everything\nbut a few small pieces, though daylight showed the ocean covered for\nmiles.  At daybreak it fell a dead calm, and with the sun, the fog\ncleared a little, and a breeze sprung up from the westward, which soon\ngrew into a gale.  We had now a fair wind, daylight, and comparatively\nclear weather; yet, to the surprise of every one, the ship continued\nhove-to.  Why does not he run?  What is the captain about? was asked\nby every one; and from questions, it soon grew into complaints and\nmurmurings.  When the daylight was so short, it was too bad to\nlose it, and a fair wind, too, which every one had been praying\nfor.  As hour followed hour, and the captain showed no sign of\nmaking sail, the crew became impatient, and there was a good deal\nof talking and consultation together, on the forecastle.  They had\nbeen beaten out with the exposure and hardship, and impatient to\nget out of it, and this unaccountable delay was more than they\ncould bear in quietness, in their excited and restless state.\nSome said that the captain was frightened,–completely cowed,\nby the dangers and difficulties that surrounded us, and was afraid\nto make sail; while others said that in his anxiety and suspense\nhe had made a free use of brandy and opium, and was unfit for\nhis duty.  The carpenter, who was an intelligent man, and a\nthorough seaman, and had great influence with the crew,\ncame down into the forecastle, and tried to induce the crew to\ngo aft and ask the captain why he did not run, or request him,\nin the name of all hands, to make sail.  This appeared to be a\nvery reasonable request, and the crew agreed that if he did not\nmake sail before noon, they would go aft.  Noon came, and no sail\nwas made.  A consultation was held again, and it was proposed to\ntake the ship from the captain and give the command of her to the\nmate, who had been heard to say that, if he could have his way,\nthe ship would have been half the distance to the Cape before\nnight,–ice or no ice.  And so irritated and impatient had the\ncrew become, that even this proposition, which was open mutiny,\npunishable with state prison, was entertained, and the carpenter\nwent to his berth, leaving it tacitly understood that something\nserious would be done, if things remained as they were many hours\nlonger.  When the carpenter left, we talked it all over, and I gave\nmy advice strongly against it.  Another of the men, too, who had\nknown something of the kind attempted in another ship by a crew\nwho were dissatisfied with their captain, and which was followed\nwith serious consequences, was opposed to it.  S––-, who soon\ncame down, joined us, and we determined to have nothing to do\nwith it.  By these means, they were soon induced to give it up,\nfor the present, though they said they would not lie where they\nwere much longer without knowing the reason.",
        "The affair remained in this state until four o’clock, when an\norder came forward for all hands to come aft upon the quarter-\ndeck.  In about ten minutes they came forward again, and the\nwhole affair had been blown.  The carpenter, very prematurely,\nand without any authority from the crew, had sounded the mate\nas to whether he would take command of the ship, and intimated\nan intention to displace the captain; and the mate, as in duty\nbound, had told the whole to the captain, who immediately sent\nfor all hands aft.  Instead of violent measures, or, at least,\nan outbreak of quarter-deck bravado, threats, and abuse, which\nthey had every reason to expect, a sense of common danger and\ncommon suffering seemed to have tamed his spirit, and begotten\nsomething like a humane fellow-feeling; for he received the crew\nin a manner quiet, and even almost kind.  He told them what he\nhad heard, and said that he did not believe that they would try\nto do any such thing as was intimated; that they had always been\ngood men,–obedient, and knew their duty, and he had no fault to\nfind with them; and asked them what they had to complain of–said\nthat no one could say that he was slow to carry sail, (which was\ntrue enough;) and that, as soon as he thought it was safe and\nproper, he should make sail.  He added a few words about their\nduty in their present situation, and sent them forward, saying\nthat he should take no further notice of the matter; but, at the\nsame time, told the carpenter to recollect whose power he was in,\nand that if he heard another word from him he would have cause to\nremember him to the day of his death.",
        "This language of the captain had a very good effect upon the crew,\nand they returned quietly to their duty. ",
        "For two days more the wind blew from the southward and eastward;\nor in the short intervals when it was fair, the ice was too thick\nto run; yet the weather was not so dreadfully bad, and the crew had\nwatch and watch.  I still remained in my berth, fast recovering,\nyet still not well enough to go safely on deck.  And I should\nhave been perfectly useless; for, from having eaten nothing for\nnearly a week, except a little rice, which I forced into my mouth\nthe last day or two, I was as weak as an infant.  To be sick in a\nforecastle is miserable indeed.  It is the worst part of a dog’s\nlife; especially in bad weather.  The forecastle, shut up tight\nto keep out the water and cold air;–the watch either on deck,\nor asleep in their berths;–no one to speak to;–the pale light of\nthe single lamp, swinging to and fro from the beam, so dim that\none can scarcely see, much less read by it;–the water dropping\nfrom the beams and carlines, and running down the sides; and the\nforecastle so wet, and dark, and cheerless, and so lumbered up\nwith chests and wet clothes, that sitting up is worse than lying\nin the berth!  These are some of the evils.  Fortunately, I needed\nno help from any one, and no medicine; and if I had needed help,\nI don’t know where I should have found it.  Sailors are willing\nenough; but it is true, as is often said–No one ships for nurse\non board a vessel.  Our merchant ships are always under-manned,\nand if one man is lost by sickness, they cannot spare another\nto take care of him.  A sailor is always presumed to be well,\nand if he’s sick, he’s a poor dog.  One has to stand his wheel,\nand another his lookout, and the sooner he gets on deck again,\nthe better.",
        "Accordingly, as soon as I could possibly go back to my duty,\nI put on my thick clothes and boots and south-wester, and made\nmy appearance on deck.  Though I had been but a few days below,\nyet everything looked strangely enough.  The ship was cased in\nice,–decks, sides, masts, yards, and rigging.  Two close-reefed\ntop-sails were all the sail she had on, and every sail and rope\nwas frozen so stiff in its place, that it seemed as though it\nwould be impossible to start anything.  Reduced, too, to her top-\nmasts, she had altogether a most forlorn and crippled appearance.\nThe sun had come up brightly; the snow was swept off the decks,\nand ashes thrown upon them, so that we could walk, for they had\nbeen as slippery as glass.",
        "It was, of course, too cold to carry on any ship’s work, and we had\nonly to walk the deck and keep ourselves warm.  The wind was still\nahead, and the whole ocean, to the eastward, covered with islands\nand field-ice.  At four bells the order was given to square away\nthe yards; and the man who came from the helm said that the captain\nhad kept her off to N. N. E.  What could this mean?  Some said that\nhe was going to put into Valparaiso, and winter, and others that\nhe was going to run out of the ice and cross the Pacific, and go\nhome round the Cape of Good Hope.  Soon, however, it leaked out,\nand we found that we were running for the straits of Magellan.\nThe news soon spread through the ship, and all tongues were at\nwork, talking about it.  No one on board had been through the\nstraits, but I had in my chest an account of the passage of the\nship A. J. Donelson, of New York, through those straits, a few\nyears before.",
        "The account was given by the captain, and the representation was\nas favorable as possible.  It was soon read by every one on board,\nand various opinions pronounced.  The determination of our captain\nhad at least this good effect; it gave every one something to\nthink and talk about, made a break in our life, and diverted our\nminds from the monotonous dreariness of the prospect before us.\nHaving made a fair wind of it, we were going off at a good rate,\nand leaving the thickest of the ice behind us.  This, at least,\nwas something.",
        "Having been long enough below to get my hands well warmed and\nsoftened, the first handling of the ropes was rather tough; but a\nfew days hardened them, and as soon as I got my mouth open wide\nenough to take in a piece of salt beef and hard bread, I was all\nright again.",
        "Sunday, July 10th.  Lat. 54° 10’, long. 79° 07’.  This was our\nposition at noon.  The sun was out bright; the ice was all left\nbehind, and things had quite a cheering appearance.  We brought\nour wet pea-jackets and trowsers on deck, and hung them up in\nthe rigging, that the breeze and the few hours of sun might dry\nthem a little; and, by the permission of the cook, the galley\nwas nearly filled with stockings and mittens, hung round to be\ndried.  Boots, too, were brought up; and having got a little tar\nand slush from below, we gave them a thick coat.  After dinner,\nall hands were turned-to, to get the anchors over the bows,\nbend on the chains, etc. The fish-tackle was got up, fish-davit\nrigged out, and after two or three hours of hard and cold work,\nboth the anchors were ready for instant use, a couple of kedges\ngot up, a hawser coiled away upon the fore-hatch, and the deep-sea-\nlead-line overhauled and got ready.  Our spirits returned with having\nsomething to do; and when the tackle was manned to bowse the anchor\nhome, notwithstanding the desolation of the scene, we struck up\n“Cheerily ho!” in full chorus.  This pleased the mate, who rubbed\nhis hands and cried out–\"That’s right, my boys; never say die!\nThat sounds like the old crew!” and the captain came up, on hearing\nthe song, and said to the passenger, within hearing of the man at\nthe wheel,–\"That sounds like a lively crew.  They’ll have their\nsong so long as there’re enough left for a chorus!”",
        "This preparation of the cable and anchors was for the passage\nof the straits; for, being very crooked, and with a variety of\ncurrents, it is necessary to come frequently to anchor.  This was\nnot, by any means, a pleasant prospect, for, of all the work that\na sailor is called upon to do in cold weather, there is none so\nbad as working the ground-tackle.  The heavy chain cables to be\nhauled and pulled about the decks with bare hands; wet hawsers,\nslip-ropes, and buoy-ropes to be hauled aboard, dripping in water,\nwhich is running up your sleeves, and freezing; clearing hawse\nunder the bows; getting under weigh and coming-to, at all hours\nof the night and day, and a constant look-out for rocks and sands\nand turns of tides;–these are some of the disagreeables of such\na navigation to a common sailor.  Fair or foul, he wants to have\nnothing to do with the ground-tackle between port and port.  One of\nour hands, too, had unluckily fallen upon a half of an old newspaper\nwhich contained an account of the passage, through the straits, of a\nBoston brig, called, I think, the Peruvian, in which she lost every\ncable and anchor she had, got aground twice, and arrived at\nValparaiso in distress.  This was set off against the account of\nthe A. J. Donelson, and led us to look forward with less confidence\nto the passage, especially as no one on board had ever been through,\nand the captain had no very perfect charts.  However, we were spared\nany further experience on the point; for the next day, when we must\nhave been near the Cape of Pillars, which is the south-west point\nof the mouth of the straits, a gale set in from the eastward, with a\nheavy fog, so that we could not see half of the ship’s length ahead.\nThis, of course, put an end to the project, for the present; for a\nthick fog and a gale blowing dead ahead are not the most favorable\ncircumstances for the passage of difficult and dangerous straits.\nThis weather, too, seemed likely to last for some time, and we\ncould not think of beating about the mouth of the straits for a\nweek or two, waiting for a favorable opportunity; so we braced up\non the larboard tack, put the ship’s head due south, and struck\nher off for Cape Horn again.",
