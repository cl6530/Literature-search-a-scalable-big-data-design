        "Sunday, November 1st.  Sailed this day, (Sunday again,) for\nSanta Barbara, where we arrived on the 5th.  Coming round St.\nBuenaventura, and nearing the anchorage, we saw two vessels in port,\na large full-rigged, and a small hermaphrodite brig.  The former,\nthe crew said must be the Pilgrim; but I had been too long in the\nPilgrim to be mistaken in her, and I was right in differing from\nthem; for, upon nearer approach, her long, low shear, sharp bows,\nand raking masts, told quite another story.  “Man-of-war brig,\"\nsaid some of them; “Baltimore clipper,” said others; the Ayacucho,\nthought I; and soon the broad folds of the beautiful banner of\nSt. George,–white field with blood-red border and cross,–were\ndisplayed from her peak.  A few minutes put it beyond a doubt,\nand we were lying by the side of the Ayacucho, which had sailed\nfrom San Diego about nine months before, while we were lying there\nin the Pilgrim.  She had since been to Valparaiso, Callao, and the\nSandwich Islands, and had just come upon the coast.  Her boat came\non board, bringing Captain Wilson; and in half an hour the news was\nall over the ship that there was a war between the United States\nand France.  Exaggerated accounts reached the forecastle.\nBattles had been fought, a large French fleet was in the Pacific,\netc., etc.; and one of the boat’s crew of the Ayacucho said that\nwhen they left Callao, a large French frigate and the American\nfrigate Brandywine, which were lying there, were going outside to\nhave a battle, and that the English frigate Blonde was to be umpire,\nand see fair play.  Here was important news for us.  Alone, on an\nunprotected coast, without an American man-of-war within some\nthousands of miles, and the prospect of a voyage home through the\nwhole length of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans!  A French prison\nseemed a much more probable place of destination than the good port\nof Boston.  However, we were too salt to believe every yarn that\ncomes into the forecastle, and waited to hear the truth of the\nmatter from higher authority.  By means of a supercargo’s clerk,\nI got the account of the matter, which was, that the governments\nhad had difficulty about the payment of a debt; that war had been\nthreatened and prepared for, but not actually declared, although it\nwas pretty generally anticipated.  This was not quite so bad, yet\nwas no small cause of anxiety.  But we cared very little about the\nmatter ourselves.  “Happy go lucky” with Jack!  We did not believe\nthat a French prison would be much worse than “hide-droghing” on\nthe coast of California; and no one who has not been on a long,\ndull voyage, shut up in one ship, can conceive of the effect of\nmonotony upon one’s thoughts and wishes.  The prospect of a change\nis like a green spot in a desert, and the remotest probability\nof great events and exciting scenes gives a feeling of delight,\nand sets life in motion, so as to give a pleasure, which any one\nnot in the same state would be entirely unable to account for.\nIn fact, a more jovial night we had not passed in the forecastle\nfor months.  Every one seemed in unaccountably high spirits.\nAn undefined anticipation of radical changes, of new scenes,\nand great doings, seemed to have possessed every one, and the\ncommon drudgery of the vessel appeared contemptible.  Here was a\nnew vein opened; a grand theme of conversation, and a topic for all\nsorts of discussions.  National feeling was wrought up.  Jokes were\ncracked upon the only Frenchman in the ship, and comparisons made\nbetween “old horse” and “soup meagre,” etc., etc.",
        "We remained in uncertainty as to this war for more than two months,\nwhen an arrival from the Sandwich Islands brought us the news of an\namicable arrangement of the difficulties. ",
        "The other vessel which we found in port was the hermaphrodite brig\nAvon, from the Sandwich Islands.  She was fitted up in handsome style;\nfired a gun and ran her ensign up and down at sunrise and sunset; had a\nband of four or five pieces of music on board, and appeared rather like\na pleasure yacht than a trader; yet, in connection with the Loriotte,\nClementine, Bolivar, Convoy, and other small vessels, belonging to\nsundry Americans at Oahu, she carried on a great trade–legal and\nillegal–in otter skins, silks, teas, specie, etc.",
        "The second day after our arrival, a full-rigged brig came round\nthe point from the northward, sailed leisurely through the bay,\nand stood off again for the south-east, in the direction of the\nlarge island of Catalina.  The next day the Avon got under weigh,\nand stood in the same direction, bound for San Pedro.  This might\ndo for marines and Californians, but we knew the ropes too well.\nThe brig was never again seen on the coast, and the Avon arrived\nat San Pedro in about a week, with a full cargo of Canton and\nAmerican goods.",
        "This was one of the means of escaping the heavy duties the Mexicans\nlay upon all imports.  A vessel comes on the coast, enters a\nmoderate cargo at Monterey, which is the only custom-house,\nand commences trading.  In a month or more, having sold a large\npart of her cargo, she stretches over to Catalina, or other of the\nlarge uninhabited islands which lie off the coast, in a trip from\nport to port, and supplies herself with choice goods from a vessel\nfrom Oahu, which has been lying off and on the islands, waiting for\nher.  Two days after the sailing of the Avon, the Loriotte came\nin from the leeward, and without doubt had also a snatch at the\nbrig’s cargo.",
        "Tuesday, Nov. 10th.  Going ashore, as usual, in the gig, just\nbefore sundown, to bring off the captain, we found, upon taking\nin the captain and pulling off again, that our ship, which lay\nthe farthest out, had run up her ensign.  This meant “Sail ho!\"\nof course, but as we were within the point we could see nothing.\n“Give way, boys!  Give way!  Lay out on your oars, and long stroke!\"\nsaid the captain; and stretching to the whole length of our arms,\nbending back again, so that our backs touched the thwarts, we sent\nher through the water like a rocket.  A few minutes of such pulling\nopened the islands, one after another, in range of the point, and gave\nus a view of the Canal, where was a ship, under top-gallant sails,\nstanding in, with a light breeze, for the anchorage.  Putting the\nboat’s head in the direction of the ship, the captain told us to lay\nout again; and we needed no spurring, for the prospect of boarding a\nnew ship, perhaps from home, hearing the news and having something\nto tell of when we got back, was excitement enough for us, and we\ngave way with a will.  Captain Nye, of the Loriotte, who had\nbeen an old whaleman, was in the stern-sheets, and fell mightily\ninto the spirit of it.  “Bend your backs and break your oars!\"\nsaid he.  “Lay me on, Captain Bunker!”  “There she flukes!” and\nother exclamations, peculiar to whalemen.  In the meantime, it\nfell flat calm, and being within a couple of miles of the ship,\nwe expected to board her in a few moments, when a sudden breeze\nsprung up, dead ahead for the ship, and she braced up and stood\noff toward the islands, sharp on the larboard tack, making good\nway through the water.  This, of course, brought us up, and we\nhad only to “ease larboard oars; pull round starboard!” and go\naboard the Alert, with something very like a flea in the ear.\nThere was a light land-breeze all night, and the ship did not come\nto anchor until the next morning.  As soon as her anchor was down,\nwe went aboard, and found her to be the whaleship, Wilmington and\nLiverpool Packet, of New Bedford, last from the “off-shore ground,\"\nwith nineteen hundred barrels of oil.  A “spouter” we knew her to\nbe as soon as we saw her, by her cranes and boats, and by her stump\ntop-gallant masts, and a certain slovenly look to the sails, rigging,\nspars and hull; and when we got on board, we found everything to\ncorrespond,–spouter fashion.  She had a false deck, which was\nrough and oily, and cut up in every direction by the chimes of\noil casks; her rigging was slack and turning white; no paint on\nthe spars or blocks; clumsy seizings and straps without covers,\nand homeward-bound splices in every direction.  Her crew, too,\nwere not in much better order.  Her captain was a slab-sided,\nshamble-legged Quaker, in a suit of brown, with a broad-brimmed\nhat, and sneaking about decks, like a sheep, with his head down;\nand the men looked more like fishermen and farmers than they did\nlike sailors.",
        "Though it was by no means cold weather, (we having on only our red\nshirts and duck trowsers,) they all had on woollen trowsers–not blue\nand shipshape–but of all colors–brown, drab, grey, aye, and green,\nwith suspenders over their shoulders, and pockets to put their hands\nin.  This, added to guernsey frocks, striped comforters about the\nneck, thick cowhide boots, woollen caps, and a strong, oily smell,\nand a decidedly green look, will complete the description.  Eight or\nten were on the fore-topsail yard, and as many more in the main,\nfurling the topsails, while eight or ten were hanging about the\nforecastle, doing nothing.  This was a strange sight for a vessel\ncoming to anchor; so we went up to them, to see what was the matter.\nOne of them, a stout, hearty-looking fellow, held out his leg and\nsaid he had the scurvy; another had cut his hand; and others had\ngot nearly well, but said that there were plenty aloft to furl the\nsails, so they were sogering on the forecastle.  There was only one\n“splicer” on board, a fine-looking old tar, who was in the bunt of\nthe fore-topsail.  He was probably the only sailor in the ship,\nbefore the mast.  The mates, of course, and the boat-steerers,\nand also two or three of the crew, had been to sea before, but\nonly whaling voyages; and the greater part of the crew were raw\nhands, just from the bush, as green as cabbages, and had not yet\ngot the hay-seed out of their heads.  The mizen topsail hung in\nthe bunt-lines until everything was furled forward.  Thus a crew\nof thirty men were half an hour in doing what would have been\ndone in the Alert with eighteen hands to go aloft, in fifteen\nor twenty minutes.",
        "We found they had been at sea six or eight months, and had no news\nto tell us; so we left them, and promised to get liberty to come\non board in the evening, for some curiosities, etc.  Accordingly,\nas soon as we were knocked off in the evening and had got supper,\nwe obtained leave, took a boat, and went aboard and spent an hour\nor two.  They gave us pieces of whalebone, and the teeth and other\nparts of curious sea animals, and we exchanged books with them–a\npractice very common among ships in foreign ports, by which you\nget rid of the books you have read and re-read, and a supply of\nnew ones in their stead, and Jack is not very nice as to their\ncomparative value.",
        "Thursday, Nov. 12th.  This day was quite cool in the early part,\nand there were black clouds about; but as it was often so in the\nmorning, nothing was apprehended, and all the captains went\nashore together, to spend the day.  Towards noon, the clouds\nhung heavily over the mountains, coming half way down the\nhills that encircle the town of Santa Barbara, and a heavy\nswell rolled in from the south-east.  The mate immediately\nordered the gig’s crew away, and at the same time, we saw boats\npulling ashore from the other vessels.  Here was a grand chance\nfor a rowing match, and every one did his best.  We passed the\nboats of the Ayacucho and Loriotte, but could gain nothing upon,\nand indeed, hardly hold our own with, the long, six-oared boat of\nthe whale-ship.  They reached the breakers before us; but here\nwe had the advantage of them, for, not being used to the surf,\nthey were obliged to wait to see us beach our boat, just as,\nin the same place, nearly a year before, we, in the Pilgrim,\nwere glad to be taught by a boat’s crew of Kanakas.",
        "We had hardly got the boats beached, and their heads out, before our\nold friend, Bill Jackson, the handsome English sailor, who steered\nthe Loriotte’s boat, called out that the brig was adrift; and, sure\nenough, she was dragging her anchors, and drifting down into the\nbight of the bay.  Without waiting for the captain, (for there\nwas no one on board but the mate and steward,) he sprung into\nthe boat, called the Kanakas together, and tried to put off.\nBut the Kanakas, though capital water-dogs, were frightened by\ntheir vessel’s being adrift, and by the emergency of the case,\nand seemed to lose their faculties.  Twice, their boat filled,\nand came broadside upon the beach.  Jackson swore at them for\na parcel of savages, and promised to flog every one of them.\nThis made the matter no better; when we came forward, told the\nKanakas to take their seats in the boat, and, going two on each\nside, walked out with her till it was up to our shoulders, and gave\nthem a shove, when, giving way with their oars, they got her safely\ninto the long, regular swell.  In the mean time, boats had put off\nfrom our ships and the whaler, and coming all on board the brig\ntogether, they let go the other anchor, paid out chain, braced the\nyards to the wind, and brought the vessel up.",
        "In a few minutes, the captains came hurrying down, on the run;\nand there was no time to be lost, for the gale promised to be a\nsevere one, and the surf was breaking upon the beach, three deep,\nhigher and higher every instant.  The Ayacucho’s boat, pulled by four\nKanakas, put off first, and as they had no rudder or steering oar,\nwould probably never have got off, had we not waded out with them,\nas far as the surf would permit.  The next that made the attempt was\nthe whale-boat, for we, being the most experienced “beach-combers,\"\nneeded no help, and staid till the last.  Whalemen make the best\nboats’ crews in the world for a long pull, but this landing was\nnew to them, and notwithstanding the examples they had had, they\nslued round and were hove up–boat, oars, and men–altogether,\nhigh and dry upon the sand.  The second time, they filled, and had\nto turn their boat over, and set her off again.  We could be of no\nhelp to them, for they were so many as to be in one another’s way,\nwithout the addition of our numbers.  The third time, they got off,\nthough not without shipping a sea which drenched them all, and half\nfilled their boat, keeping them baling, until they reached their\nship.  We now got ready to go off, putting the boat’s head out;\nEnglish Ben and I, who were the largest, standing on each side of\nthe bows, to keep her “head on” to the sea, two more shipping and\nmanning the two after oars, and the captain taking the steering\noar.  Two or three Spaniards, who stood upon the beach looking\nat us, wrapped their cloaks about them, shook their heads, and\nmuttered “Caramba!”  They had no taste for such doings; in fact,\nthe hydrophobia is a national malady, and shows itself in their\npersons as well as their actions.",
        "Watching for a “smooth chance,” we determined to show the other\nboats the way it should be done; and, as soon as ours floated,\nran out with her, keeping her head on, with all our strength, and\nthe help of the captain’s oar, and the two after oarsmen giving\nway regularly and strongly, until our feet were off the ground,\nwe tumbled into the bows, keeping perfectly still, from fear of\nhindering the others.  For some time it was doubtful how it would\ngo.  The boat stood nearly up and down in the water, and the sea,\nrolling from under her, let her fall upon the water with a force\nwhich seemed almost to stave her bottom in.  By quietly sliding\ntwo oars forward, along the thwarts, without impeding the rowers,\nwe shipped two bow oars, and thus, by the help of four oars and\nthe captain’s strong arm, we got safely off, though we shipped\nseveral seas, which left us half full of water.  We pulled\nalongside of the Loriotte, put her skipper on board, and found\nher making preparations for slipping, and then pulled aboard our\nown ship.  Here Mr. Brown, always “on hand,” had got everything\nready, so that we had only to hook on the gig and hoist it up,\nwhen the order was given to loose the sails.  While we were on\nthe yards, we saw the Loriotte under weigh, and before our yards\nwere mast-headed, the Ayacucho had spread her wings, and, with yards\nbraced sharp up, was standing athwart our hawse.  There is no prettier\nsight in the world than a full-rigged, clipper-built brig, sailing sharp\non the wind.  In a moment, our slip-rope was gone, the head-yards filled\naway, and we were off.  Next came the whaler; and in a half an hour from\nthe time when four vessels were lying quietly at anchor, without a\nrag out, or a sign of motion, the bay was deserted, and four white\nclouds were standing off to sea.  Being sure of clearing the point,\nwe stood off with our yards a little braced in, while the Ayacucho\nwent off with a taught bowline, which brought her to windward of us.\nDuring all this day, and the greater part of the night, we had the\nusual south-easter entertainment, a gale of wind, variegated and\nfinally topped off with a drenching rain of three or four hours.\nAt daybreak, the clouds thinned off and rolled away, and the sun\ncame up clear.  The wind, instead of coming out from the northward,\nas is usual, blew steadily and freshly from the anchoring-ground.\nThis was bad for us, for, being “flying light,” with little more\nthan ballast trim, we were in no condition for showing off on a\ntaught bowline, and had depended upon a fair wind, with which,\nby the help of our light sails and studding-sails, we meant to\nhave been the first at the anchoring-ground; but the Ayacucho\nwas a good league to windward of us, and was standing in, in fine\nstyle.  The whaler, however, was as far to leeward of us, and the\nLoriotte was nearly out of sight, among the islands, up the Canal.\nBy hauling every brace and bowline, and clapping watch-tackles upon\nall the sheets and halyards, we managed to hold our own, and drop\nthe leeward vessels a little in every tack.  When we reached the\nanchoring-ground, the Ayacucho had got her anchor, furled her\nsails, squared her yards, and was lying as quietly as if nothing\nhad happened for the last twenty-four hours.",
        "We had our usual good luck in getting our anchor without letting go\nanother, and were all snug, with our boats at the boom-ends, in half\nan hour.  In about two hours more, the whaler came in, and made a\nclumsy piece of work in getting her anchor, being obliged to let\ngo her best bower, and finally, to get out a kedge and a hawser.\nThey were heave-ho-ing, stopping and unstopping, pawling, catting,\nand fishing, for three hours; and the sails hung from the yards all\nthe afternoon, and were not furled until sundown.  The Loriotte came\nin just after dark, and let go her anchor, making no attempt to pick\nup the other until the next day.",
        "This affair led to a great dispute as to the sailing of our ship\nand the Ayacucho.  Bets were made between the captains, and the\ncrews took it up in their own way; but as she was bound to leeward\nand we to windward, and merchant captains cannot deviate, a trial\nnever took place; and perhaps it was well for us that it did not,\nfor the Ayacucho had been eight years in the Pacific, in every part\nof it–Valparaiso, Sandwich Islands, Canton, California, and all,\nand was called the fastest merchantman that traded in the Pacific,\nunless it was the brig John Gilpin, and perhaps the ship Ann McKim\nof Baltimore.",
        "Saturday, Nov. 14th.  This day we got under weigh, with the agent\nand several Spaniards of note, as passengers, bound up to Monterey.\nWe went ashore in the gig to bring them off with their baggage,\nand found them waiting on the beach, and a little afraid about\ngoing off, as the surf was running very high.  This was nuts to\nus; for we liked to have a Spaniard wet with salt water; and then\nthe agent was very much disliked by the crew, one and all; and we\nhoped, as there was no officer in the boat, to have a chance to\nduck them; for we knew that they were such “marines” that they\nwould not know whether it was our fault or not.  Accordingly,\nwe kept the boat so far from shore as to oblige them to wet their\nfeet in getting into her; and then waited for a good high comber,\nand letting the head slue a little round, sent the whole force of\nthe sea into the stern-sheets, drenching them from head to feet.\nThe Spaniards sprang out of the boat, swore, and shook themselves\nand protested against trying it again; and it was with the greatest\ndifficulty that the agent could prevail upon them to make another\nattempt.  The next time we took care, and went off easily enough,\nand pulled aboard.  The crew came to the side to hoist in their\nbaggage, and we gave them the wink, and they heartily enjoyed the\nhalf-drowned looks of the company.",
        "Everything being now ready, and the passengers aboard, we ran up\nthe ensign and broad pennant, (for there was no man-of-war, and\nwe were the largest vessel on the coast,) and the other vessels\nran up their ensigns.  Having hove short, cast off the gaskets,\nand made the bunt of each sail fast by the jigger, with a man on\neach yard; at the word, the whole canvas of the ship was loosed,\nand with the greatest rapidity possible, everything was sheeted\nhome and hoisted up, the anchor tripped and catheaded, and the\nship under headway.  We were determined to show the “spouter” how\nthings could be done in a smart ship, with a good crew, though not\nmore than half their number.  The royal yards were all crossed at\nonce, and royals and skysails set, and, as we had the wind free,\nthe booms were run out, and every one was aloft, active as cats,\nlaying out on the yards and booms, reeving the studding-sail gear;\nand sail after sail the captain piled upon her, until she was covered\nwith canvas, her sails looking like a great white cloud resting\nupon a black speck.  Before we doubled the point, we were going\nat a dashing rate, and leaving the shipping far astern.  We had\na fine breeze to take us through the Canal, as they call this bay\nof forty miles long by ten wide.  The breeze died away at night,\nand we were becalmed all day on Sunday, about half way between\nSanta Barbara and Point Conception.  Sunday night we had a light,\nfair wind, which set us up again; and having a fine sea-breeze on\nthe first part of Monday, we had the prospect of passing, without\nany trouble, Point Conception,–the Cape Horn of California,\nwhere it begins to blow the first of January, and blows all the\nyear round.  Toward the latter part of the afternoon, however,\nthe regular northwest wind, as usual, set in, which brought in our\nstudding-sails, and gave us the chance of beating round the Point,\nwhich we were now just abreast of, and which stretched off into the\nPacific, high, rocky and barren, forming the central point of the\ncoast for hundreds of miles north and south.  A cap-full of wind\nwill be a bag-full here, and before night our royals were furled,\nand the ship was laboring hard under her top-gallant sails.  At eight\nbells our watch went below, leaving her with as much sail as she\ncould stagger under, the water flying over the forecastle at every\nplunge.  It was evidently blowing harder, but then there was not a\ncloud in the sky, and the sun had gone down bright.",
        "We had been below but a short time, before we had the usual\npremonitions of a coming gale: seas washing over the whole\nforward part of the vessel, and her bows beating against them\nwith a force and sound like the driving of piles.  The watch,\ntoo, seemed very busy trampling about decks, and singing out at\nthe ropes.  A sailor can always tell, by the sound, what sail is\ncoming in, and, in a short time, we heard the top-gallant sails\ncome in, one after another, and then the flying jib.  This seemed\nto ease her a good deal, and we were fast going off to the land\nof Nod, when–bang, bang, bang–on the scuttle, and “All hands,\nreef topsails, ahoy!” started us out of our berths; and, it not\nbeing very cold weather, we had nothing extra to put on, and were\nsoon on deck.  I shall never forget the fineness of the sight.\nIt was a clear, and rather a chilly night; the stars were twinkling\nwith an intense brightness, and as far as the eye could reach,\nthere was not a cloud to be seen.  The horizon met the sea in a\ndefined line.  A painter could not have painted so clear a sky.\nThere was not a speck upon it.  Yet it was blowing great guns from\nthe north-west.  When you can see a cloud to windward, you feel that\nthere is a place for the wind to come from; but here it seemed to\ncome from nowhere.  No person could have told, from the heavens,\nby their eyesight alone, that it was not a still summer’s night.\nOne reef after another, we took in the topsails, and before\nwe could get them hoisted up, we heard a sound like a short,\nquick rattling of thunder, and the jib was blown to atoms out of\nthe bolt-rope.  We got the topsails set, and the fragments of the\njib stowed away, and the fore-topmast staysail set in its place,\nwhen the great mainsail gaped open, and the sail ripped from head\nto foot.  “Lay up on that main-yard and furl the sail, before it\nblows to tatters!” shouted the captain; and in a moment, we were\nup, gathering the remains of it upon the yard.  We got it wrapped,\nround the yard, and passed gaskets over it as snugly as possible,\nand were just on deck again, when, with another loud rent,\nwhich was heard throughout the ship, the fore-topsail, which had\nbeen double-reefed, split in two, athwartships, just below the\nreefband, from earing to earing.  Here again it was down yard,\nhaul out reef-tackles, and lay out upon the yard for reefing.\nBy hauling the reef-tackles chock-a-block, we took the strain\nfrom the other earings, and passing the close-reef earing,\nand knotting the points carefully, we succeeded in setting\nthe sail, close-reefed.",
        "We had but just got the rigging coiled up, and were waiting to\nhear “go below the watch!” when the main royal worked loose from\nthe gaskets, and blew directly out to leeward, flapping, and shaking\nthe mast like a wand.  Here was a job for somebody.  The royal must\ncome in or be cut adrift, or the mast would be snapped short off.\nAll the light hands in the starboard watch were sent up, one after\nanother, but they could do nothing with it.  At length, John,\nthe tall Frenchman, the head of the starboard watch, (and a better\nsailor never stepped upon a deck,) sprang aloft, and, by the help\nof his long arms and legs, succeeded, after a hard struggle,–the\nsail blowing over the yard-arm to leeward, and the skysail blowing\ndirectly over his head–in smothering it, and frapping it with long\npieces of sinnet.  He came very near being blown or shaken from\nthe yard, several times, but he was a true sailor, every finger\na fish-hook.  Having made the sail snug, he prepared to send the\nyard down, which was a long and difficult job; for, frequently,\nhe was obliged to stop and hold on with all his might, for several\nminutes, the ship pitching so as to make it impossible to do\nanything else at that height.  The yard at length came down\nsafe, and after it, the fore and mizen royal-yards were sent\ndown.  All hands were then sent aloft, and for an hour or two\nwe were hard at work, making the booms well fast; unreeving the\nstudding-sail and royal and skysail gear; getting rolling-ropes\non the yards; setting up the weather breast-backstays; and making\nother preparations for a storm.  It was a fine night for a gale;\njust cool and bracing enough for quick work, without being cold,\nand as bright as day.  It was sport to have a gale in such weather\nas this.  Yet it blew like a hurricane.  The wind seemed to come\nwith a spite, an edge to it, which threatened to scrape us off\nthe yards.  The mere force of the wind was greater than I had\never seen it before; but darkness, cold, and wet are the worst\nparts of a storm to a sailor.",
        "Having got on deck again, we looked round to see what time of\nnight it was, and whose watch.  In a few minutes the man at the\nwheel struck four bells, and we found that the other watch was out,\nand our own half out.  Accordingly, the starboard watch went below,\nand left the ship to us for a couple of hours, yet with orders to\nstand by for a call.",
        "Hardly had they got below, before away went the fore-topmast staysail,\nblown to ribbons.  This was a small sail, which we could manage in\nthe watch, so that we were not obliged to call up the other watch.\nWe laid out upon the bowsprit, where we were under water half the\ntime, and took in the fragments of the sail, and as she must have\nsome head sail on her, prepared to bend another staysail.  We got\nthe new one out, into the nettings; seized on the tack, sheets,\nand halyards, and the hanks; manned the halyards, cut adrift the\nfrapping lines, and hoisted away; but before it was half way up\nthe stay, it was blown all to pieces.  When we belayed the halyards,\nthere was nothing left but the bolt-rope.  Now large eyes began to\nshow themselves in the foresail, and knowing that it must soon go,\nthe mate ordered us upon the yard to furl it.  Being unwilling to\ncall up the watch who had been on deck all night, he roused out the\ncarpenter, sailmaker, cook, steward, and other idlers, and,\nwith their help, we manned the foreyard, and after nearly half an\nhour’s struggle, mastered the sail, and got it well furled round\nthe yard.  The force of the wind had never been greater than at\nthis moment.  In going up the rigging, it seemed absolutely to pin\nus down to the shrouds; and on the yard, there was no such thing\nas turning a face to windward.  Yet here was no driving sleet,\nand darkness, and wet, and cold, as off Cape Horn; and instead of\na stiff oil-cloth suit, south-wester caps, and thick boots, we had\non hats, round jackets, duck trowsers, light shoes, and everything\nlight and easy.  All these things make a great difference to a\nsailor.  When we got on deck, the man at the wheel struck eight\nbells, (four o’clock in the morning,) and “All starbowlines,\nahoy!” brought the other watch up.  But there was no going below\nfor us.  The gale was now at its height, “blowing like scissors\nand thumb-screws;” the captain was on deck; the ship, which was\nlight, rolling and pitching as though she would shake the long\nsticks out of her; and the sail gaping open and splitting, in\nevery direction.  The mizen topsail, which was a comparatively\nnew sail, and close-reefed, split, from head to foot, in the\nbunt; the fore-topsail went, in one rent, from clew to earing,\nand was blowing to tatters; one of the chain bobstays parted;\nthe spritsail-yard sprung in the slings; the martingale had slued\naway off to leeward; and, owing to the long dry weather, the lee\nrigging hung in large bights, at every lurch.  One of the main\ntop-gallant shrouds had parted; and, to crown all, the galley had\ngot adrift, and gone over to leeward, and the anchor on the lee\nbow had worked loose, and was thumping the side.  Here was work\nenough for all hands for half a day.  Our gang laid out on the\nmizen topsail yard, and after more than half an hour’s hard work,\nfurled the sail, though it bellied out over our heads, and again,\nby a slant of the wind, blew in under the yard, with a fearful\njerk, and almost threw us off from the foot-ropes.",
        "Double gaskets were passed round the yards, rolling tackles and\nother gear bowsed taught, and everything made as secure as could\nbe.  Coming down, we found the rest of the crew just coming down\nthe fore rigging, having furled the tattered topsail, or, rather,\nswathed it round the yard, which looked like a broken limb, bandaged.\nThere was no sail now on the ship but the spanker and the close-reefed\nmain topsail, which still held good.  But this was too much after\nsail; and order was given to furl the spanker.  The brails were\nhauled up, and all the light hands in the starboard watch sent\nout on the gaff to pass the gaskets; but they could do nothing\nwith it.  The second mate swore at them for a parcel of “sogers,\"\nand sent up a couple of the best men; but they could do no better,\nand the gaff was lowered down.  All hands were now employed in\nsetting up the lee rigging, fishing the spritsail-yard, lashing\nthe galley, and getting tackles upon the martingale, to bowse it\nto windward.  Being in the larboard watch, my duty was forward,\nto assist in setting up the martingale.  Three of us were out on\nthe martingale guys and back-ropes for more than half an hour,\ncarrying out, hooking and unhooking the tackles, several times\nburied in the seas, until the mate ordered us in, from fear of\nour being washed off.  The anchors were then to be taken up on\nthe rail, which kept all hands on the forecastle for an hour,\nthough every now and then the seas broke over it, washing the\nrigging off to leeward, filling the lee scuppers breast high,\nand washing chock aft to the taffrail.",
        "Having got everything secure again, we were promising ourselves\nsome breakfast, for it was now nearly nine o’clock in the forenoon,\nwhen the main topsail showed evident signs of giving way.  Some sail\nmust be kept on the ship, and the captain ordered the fore and main\nspencer gaffs to be lowered down, and the two spencers (which were\nstorm sails, bran new, small, and made of the strongest canvas)\nto be got up and bent; leaving the main topsail to blow away,\nwith a blessing on it, if it would only last until we could set\nthe spencers.  These we bent on very carefully, with strong robands\nand seizings, and making tackles fast to the clews, bowsed them down\nto the water-ways.  By this time the main topsail was among the\nthings that have been, and we went aloft to stow away the remnant\nof the last sail of all those which were on the ship twenty-four\nhours before.  The spencers were now the only whole sails on the\nship, and, being strong and small, and near the deck, presenting\nbut little surface to the wind above the rail, promised to hold\nout well.  Hove-to under these, and eased by having no sail above\nthe tops, the ship rose and fell, and drifted off to leeward like\na line-of-battle ship.",
        "It was now eleven o’clock, and the watch was sent below to\nget breakfast, and at eight bells (noon), as everything was\nsnug, although the gale had not in the least abated, the watch\nwas set, and the other watch and idlers sent below.  For three\ndays and three nights, the gale continued with unabated fury,\nand with singular regularity.  There was no lulls, and very\nlittle variation in its fierceness.  Our ship, being light,\nrolled so as almost to send the fore yard-arm under water,\nand drifted off bodily, to leeward.  All this time there was\nnot a cloud to be seen in the sky, day or night;–no, not so\nlarge as a man’s hand.  Every morning the sun rose cloudless\nfrom the sea, and set again at night, in the sea, in a flood of\nlight.  The stars, too, came out of the blue, one after another,\nnight after night, unobscured, and twinkled as clear as on a still\nfrosty night at home, until the day came upon them.  All this time,\nthe sea was rolling in immense surges, white with foam, as far as\nthe eye could reach, on every side, for we were now leagues and\nleagues from shore.",
        "The between-decks being empty, several of us slept there in hammocks,\nwhich are the best things in the world to sleep in during a storm;\nit not being true of them, as it is of another kind of bed, “when the\nwind blows, the cradle will rock;” for it is the ship that rocks,\nwhile they always hang vertically from the beams.  During these\nseventy-two hours we had nothing to do, but to turn in and out,\nfour hours on deck, and four below, eat, sleep, and keep watch.\nThe watches were only varied by taking the helm in turn, and now\nand then, by one of the sails, which were furled, blowing out of\nthe gaskets, and getting adrift, which sent us up on the yards;\nand by getting tackles on different parts of the rigging, which were\nslack.  Once, the wheel-rope parted, which might have been fatal\nto us, had not the chief mate sprung instantly with a relieving\ntackle to windward, and kept the tiller up, till a new one could\nbe rove.  On the morning of the twentieth, at daybreak, the gale\nhad evidently done its worst, and had somewhat abated; so much so,\nthat all hands were called to bend new sails, although it was still\nblowing as hard as two common gales.  One at a time, and with great\ndifficulty and labor, the old sails were unbent and sent down\nby the bunt-lines, and three new topsails, made for the homeward\npassage round Cape Horn, and which had never been bent, were got\nup from the sailroom, and under the care of the sailmaker, were\nfitted for bending, and sent up by the halyards into the tops, and,\nwith stops and frapping lines, were bent to the yards, close-reefed,\nsheeted home, and hoisted.  These were done one at a time, and with\nthe greatest care and difficulty.  Two spare courses were then\ngot up and bent in the same manner and furled, and a storm-jib,\nwith the bonnet off, bent and furled to the boom.  It was twelve\no’clock before we got through; and five hours of more exhausting\nlabor I never experienced; and no one of that ship’s crew, I will\nventure to say, will ever desire again to unbend and bend five large\nsails, in the teeth of a tremendous north-wester.  Towards night,\na few clouds appeared in the horizon, and as the gale moderated,\nthe usual appearance of driving clouds relieved the face of the sky.\nThe fifth day after the commencement of the storm, we shook a reef\nout of each topsail, and set the reefed foresail, jib and spanker;\nbut it was not until after eight days of reefed topsails that we\nhad a whole sail on the ship; and then it was quite soon enough,\nfor the captain was anxious to make up for leeway, the gale having\nblown us half the distance to the Sandwich Islands.",
        "Inch by inch, as fast as the gale would permit, we made sail on the\nship, for the wind still continued a-head, and we had many days’\nsailing to get back to the longitude we were in when the storm\ntook us.  For eight days more we beat to windward under a stiff\ntop-gallant breeze, when the wind shifted and became variable.\nA light south-easter, to which we could carry a reefed topmast\nstudding-sail, did wonders for our dead reckoning.",
        "Friday, December 4th, after a passage of twenty days, we arrived\nat the mouth of the bay of San Francisco.",
