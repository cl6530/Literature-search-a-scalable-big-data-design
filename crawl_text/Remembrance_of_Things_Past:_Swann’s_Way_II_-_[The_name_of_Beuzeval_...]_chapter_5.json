        "The name of Beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the\nsame district, Beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen, a\nsecond name, to wit Bréauté, which he had often seen on maps, but without\never previously remarking that it was the same name as that borne by his\nfriend M. de Bréauté, whom the anonymous letter accused of having been\nOdette’s lover. After all, when it came to M. de Bréauté, there was\nnothing improbable in the charge; but so far as Mme. Verdurin was\nconcerned, it was a sheer impossibility. From the fact that Odette did\noccasionally tell a lie, it was not fair to conclude that she never, by\nany chance, told the truth, and in these bantering conversations with Mme.\nVerdurin which she herself had repeated to Swann, he could recognize those\nmeaningless and dangerous pleasantries which, in their inexperience of\nlife and ignorance of vice, women often utter (thereby certifying their\nown innocence), who–as, for instance, Odette,–would be the last people\nin the world to feel any undue affection for one another. Whereas, on the\nother hand, the indignation with which she had scattered the suspicions\nwhich she had unintentionally brought into being, for a moment, in his\nmind by her story, fitted in with everything that he knew of the tastes,\nthe temperament of his mistress. But at that moment, by an inspiration of\njealousy, analogous to the inspiration which reveals to a poet or a\nphilosopher, who has nothing, so far, but an odd pair of rhymes or a\ndetached observation, the idea or the natural law which will give power,\nmastery to his work, Swann recalled for the first time a remark which\nOdette had made to him, at least two years before: “Oh, Mme. Verdurin, she\nwon’t hear of anything just now but me. I’m a ’love,’ if you please, and\nshe kisses me, and wants me to go with her everywhere, and call her by her\nChristian name.” So far from seeing in these expressions any connection\nwith the absurd insinuations, intended to create an atmosphere of vice,\nwhich Odette had since repeated to him, he had welcomed them as a proof of\nMme. Verdurin’s warm-hearted and generous friendship. But now this old\nmemory of her affection for Odette had coalesced suddenly with his more\nrecent memory of her unseemly conversation. He could no longer separate\nthem in his mind, and he saw them blended in reality, the affection\nimparting a certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which,\nin return, spoiled the affection of its innocence. He went to see Odette.\nHe sat down, keeping at a distance from her. He did not dare to embrace\nher, not knowing whether in her, in himself, it would be affection or\nanger that a kiss would provoke. He sat there silent, watching their love\nexpire. Suddenly he made up his mind.",
        "“Odette, my darling,” he began, “I know, I am being simply odious, but I\nmust ask you a few questions. You remember what I once thought about you\nand Mme. Verdurin? Tell me, was it true? Have you, with her or anyone\nelse, ever?”",
        "She shook her head, pursing her lips together; a sign which people\ncommonly employ to signify that they are not going, because it would bore\nthem to go, when some one has asked, “Are you coming to watch the\nprocession go by?”, or “Will you be at the review?”. But this shake of the\nhead, which is thus commonly used to decline participation in an event\nthat has yet to come, imparts for that reason an element of uncertainty to\nthe denial of participation in an event that is past. Furthermore, it\nsuggests reasons of personal convenience, rather than any definite\nrepudiation, any moral impossibility. When he saw Odette thus make him a\nsign that the insinuation was false, he realised that it was quite\npossibly true.",
        "“I have told you, I never did; you know quite well,” she added, seeming\nangry and uncomfortable.",
        "“Yes, I know all that; but are you quite sure? Don’t say to me, ’You know\nquite well’; say, ’I have never done anything of that sort with any\nwoman.’”",
        "She repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote, and as though she\nhoped, thereby, to be rid of him: “I have never done anything of that sort\nwith any woman.”",
        "“Can you swear it to me on your Laghetto medal?”",
        "Swann knew that Odette would never perjure herself on that.",
        "“Oh, you do make me so miserable,” she cried, with a jerk of her body as\nthough to shake herself free of the constraint of his question. “Have you\nnearly done? What is the matter with you to-day? You seem to have made up\nyour mind that I am to be forced to hate you, to curse you! Look, I was\nanxious to be friends with you again, for us to have a nice time together,\nlike the old days; and this is all the thanks I get!”",
        "However, he would not let her go, but sat there like a surgeon who waits\nfor a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not\nmake him abandon it.",
        "“You are quite wrong in supposing that I bear you the least ill-will in\nthe world, Odette,” he began with a persuasive and deceitful gentleness.\n“I never speak to you except of what I already know, and I always know a\ngreat deal more than I say. But you alone can mollify by your confession\nwhat makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by other\npeople. My anger with you is never due to your actions–I can and do\nforgive you everything because I love you–but to your untruthfulness, the\nridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in denying things which\nI know to be true. How can you expect that I shall continue to love you,\nwhen I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know\nto be false? Odette, do not prolong this moment which is torturing us\nboth. If you are willing to end it at once, you shall be free of it for\never.  Tell me, upon your medal, yes or no, whether you have ever done\nthose things.”",
        "“How on earth can I tell?” she was furious. “Perhaps I have, ever so long\nago, when I didn’t know what I was doing, perhaps two or three times.”",
        "Swann had prepared himself for all possibilities. Reality must, therefore,\nbe something which bears no relation to possibilities, any more than the\nstab of a knife in one’s body bears to the gradual movement of the clouds\noverhead, since those words “two or three times” carved, as it were, a\ncross upon the living tissues of his heart. A strange thing, indeed, that\nthose words, “two or three times,” nothing more than a few words, words\nuttered in the air, at a distance, could so lacerate a man’s heart, as if\nthey had actually pierced it, could sicken a man, like a poison that he\nhad drunk. Instinctively Swann thought of the remark that he had heard at\nMme. de Saint-Euverte’s: “I have never seen anything to beat it since the\ntable-turning.” The agony that he now suffered in no way resembled what he\nhad supposed. Not only because, in the hours when he most entirely\nmistrusted her, he had rarely imagined such a culmination of evil, but\nbecause, even when he did imagine that offence, it remained vague,\nuncertain, was not clothed in the particular horror which had escaped with\nthe words “perhaps two or three times,” was not armed with that specific\ncruelty, as different from anything that he had known as a new malady by\nwhich one is attacked for the first time. And yet this Odette, from whom\nall this evil sprang, was no less dear to him, was, on the contrary, more\nprecious, as if, in proportion as his sufferings increased, there\nincreased at the same time the price of the sedative, of the antidote\nwhich this woman alone possessed. He wished to pay her more attention, as\none attends to a disease which one discovers, suddenly, to have grown more\nserious. He wished that the horrible thing which, she had told him, she\nhad done “two or three times” might be prevented from occurring again. To\nensure that, he must watch over Odette. People often say that, by pointing\nout to a man the faults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening\nhis attachment to her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more\nso if he does! But, Swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect\nher? He might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of\nany one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how\ninsane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when he had\nfailed to find Odette at the Verdurins’) to desire the possession–as if\nthat were ever possible–of another person. Happily for Swann, beneath the\nmass of suffering which had invaded his soul like a conquering horde of\nbarbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older, more placid, and\nsilently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ which at once set\nto work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles of a paralysed limb\nwhich tend to recover their former movements. These older, these\nautochthonous in-dwellers in his soul absorbed all Swann’s strength, for a\nwhile, in that obscure task of reparation which gives one an illusory\nsense of repose during convalescence, or after an operation. This time it\nwas not so much–as it ordinarily was–in Swann’s brain that the\nslackening of tension due to exhaustion took effect, it was rather in his\nheart. But all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur,\nand, like a dying animal that is once more stirred by the throes of a\nconvulsion which was, apparently, ended, upon Swann’s heart, spared for a\nmoment only, the same agony returned of its own accord to trace the same\ncross again. He remembered those moonlit evenings, when, leaning back in\nthe victoria that was taking him to the Rue La Pérouse, he would cultivate\nwith voluptuous enjoyment the emotions of a man in love, ignorant of the\npoisoned fruit that such emotions must inevitably bear. But all those\nthoughts lasted for no more than a second, the time that it took him to\nraise his hand to his heart, to draw breath again and to contrive to\nsmile, so as to dissemble his torment. Already he had begun to put further\nquestions. For his jealousy, which had taken an amount of trouble, such as\nno enemy would have incurred, to strike him this mortal blow, to make him\nforcibly acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known, his\njealousy was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to\nexpose his bosom to an even deeper wound. Like an evil deity, his jealousy\nwas inspiring Swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. It was not\nhis fault, but Odette’s alone, if at first his punishment was not more\nsevere.",
        "“My darling,” he began again, “it’s all over now; was it with anyone I\nknow?”",
        "“No, I swear it wasn’t; besides, I think I exaggerated, I never really\nwent as far as that.”",
        "He smiled, and resumed with: “Just as you like. It doesn’t really matter,\nbut it’s unfortunate that you can’t give me any name. If I were able to\nform an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking of her\nagain. I say it for your own sake, because then I shouldn’t bother you any\nmore about it. It’s so soothing to be able to form a clear picture of\nthings in one’s mind. What is really terrible is what one cannot imagine.\nBut you’ve been so sweet to me; I don’t want to tire you. I do thank you,\nwith all my heart, for all the good that you have done me. I’ve quite\nfinished now.  Only one word more: how many times?”",
        "“Oh, Charles! can’t you see, you’re killing me? It’s all ever so long ago.\nI’ve never given it a thought. Anyone would say that you were positively\ntrying to put those ideas into my head again. And then you’d be a lot\nbetter off!” she concluded, with unconscious stupidity but with\nintentional malice.",
        "“I only wished to know whether it had been since I knew you. It’s only\nnatural. Did it happen here, ever? You can’t give me any particular\nevening, so that I can remind myself what I was doing at the time? You\nunderstand, surely, that it’s not possible that you don’t remember with\nwhom, Odette, my love.”",
        "“But I don’t know; really, I don’t. I think it was in the Bois, one\nevening when you came to meet us on the Island. You had been dining with\nthe Princesse des Laumes,” she added, happy to be able to furnish him with\nan exact detail, which testified to her veracity. “At the next table there\nwas a woman whom I hadn’t seen for ever so long. She said to me, ’Come\nalong round behind the rock, there, and look at the moonlight on the\nwater!’ At first I just yawned, and said, ’No, I’m too tired, and I’m\nquite happy where I am, thank you.’ She swore there’d never been anything\nlike it in the way of moonlight. ’I’ve heard that tale before,’ I said to\nher; you see, I knew quite well what she was after.” Odette narrated this\nepisode almost as if it were a joke, either because it appeared to her to\nbe quite natural, or because she thought that she was thereby minimising\nits importance, or else so as not to appear ashamed. But, catching sight\nof Swann’s face, she changed her tone, and:",
        "“You are a fiend!” she flung at him, “you enjoy tormenting me, making me\ntell you lies, just so that you’ll leave me in peace.”",
        "This second blow struck at Swann was even more excruciating than the\nfirst. Never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair, hidden\nfrom his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it, not in a past\nwhich he had never known, but in evenings which he so well remembered,\nwhich he had lived through with Odette, of which he had supposed himself\nto have such an intimate, such an exhaustive knowledge, and which now\nassumed, retrospectively, an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty. In\nthe midst of them parted, suddenly, a gaping chasm, that moment on the\nIsland in the Bois de Boulogne. Without being intelligent, Odette had the\ncharm of being natural. She had recounted, she had acted the little scene\nwith so much simplicity that Swann, as he gasped for breath, could vividly\nsee it: Odette yawning, the “rock there,”... He could hear her\nanswer–alas, how lightheartedly–\"I’ve heard that tale before!” He felt\nthat she would tell him nothing more that evening, that no further\nrevelation was to be expected for the present. He was silent for a time,\nthen said to her:",
        "“My poor darling, you must forgive me; I know, I am hurting you\ndreadfully, but it’s all over now; I shall never think of it again.”",
        "But she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not\nknow, and on that past era of their love, monotonous and soothing in his\nmemory because it was vague, and now rent, as with a sword-wound, by the\nnews of that minute on the Island in the Bois, by moonlight, while he was\ndining with the Princesse des Laumes. But he had so far acquired the habit\nof finding life interesting–of marvelling at the strange discoveries that\nthere were to be made in it–that even while he was suffering so acutely\nthat he did not believe it possible to endure such agony for any length of\ntime, he was saying to himself: “Life is indeed astonishing, and holds\nsome fine surprises; it appears that vice is far more common than one has\nbeen led to believe. Here is a woman in whom I had absolute confidence,\nwho looks so simple, so honest, who, in any case, even allowing that her\nmorals are not strict, seemed quite normal and healthy in her tastes and\ninclinations. I receive a most improbable accusation, I question her, and\nthe little that she admits reveals far more than I could ever have\nsuspected.” But he could not confine himself to these detached\nobservations.  He sought to form an exact estimate of the importance of\nwhat she had just told him, so as to know whether he might conclude that\nshe had done these things often, and was likely to do them again. He\nrepeated her words to himself: “I knew quite well what she was after.\"\n“Two or three times.” “I’ve heard that tale before.” But they did not\nreappear in his memory unarmed; each of them held a knife with which it\nstabbed him afresh.  For a long time, like a sick man who cannot restrain\nhimself from attempting, every minute, to make the movement that, he\nknows, will hurt him, he kept on murmuring to himself: “I’m quite happy\nwhere I am, thank you,” “I’ve heard that tale before,” but the pain was so\nintense that he was obliged to stop. He was amazed to find that actions\nwhich he had always, hitherto, judged so lightly, had dismissed, indeed,\nwith a laugh, should have become as serious to him as a disease which\nmight easily prove fatal. He knew any number of women whom he could ask to\nkeep an eye on Odette, but how was he to expect them to adjust themselves\nto his new point of view, and not to remain at that which for so long had\nbeen his own, which had always guided him in his voluptuous existence; not\nto say to him with a smile: “You jealous monster, wanting to rob other\npeople of their pleasure!” By what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he\n(who had never found, in the old days, in his love for Odette, any but the\nmost refined of pleasures) been precipitated into this new circle of hell\nfrom which he could not see how he was ever to escape. Poor Odette! He\nwished her no harm. She was but half to blame. Had he not been told that\nit was her own mother who had sold her, when she was still little more\nthan a child, at Nice, to a wealthy Englishman? But what an agonising\ntruth was now contained for him in those lines of Alfred de Vigny’s\nJournal d’un Poète which he had previously read without emotion: “When\none feels oneself smitten by love for a woman, one ought to say to\noneself, ’What are ’her surroundings? What has been her life?’ All one’s\nfuture happiness lies in the answer.” Swann was astonished that such\nsimple phrases, spelt over in his mind as, “I’ve heard that tale before,\"\nor “I knew quite well what she was after,” could cause him so much pain.\nBut he realised that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed\nparts of the panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that\nhe had felt while Odette was telling her story. For it was the same\nanguish that he now was feeling afresh. It was no good, his knowing\nnow,–indeed, it was no good, as time went on, his having partly forgotten\nand altogether forgiven the offence–whenever he repeated her words his\nold anguish refashioned him as he had been before Odette began to speak:\nignorant, trustful; his merciless jealousy placed him once again, so that\nhe might be effectively wounded by Odette’s admission, in the position of\na man who does not yet know the truth; and after several months this old\nstory would still dumbfounder him, like a sudden revelation. He marvelled\nat the terrible recreative power of his memory. It was only by the\nweakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes as age\ncreeps over one, that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments. But,\nas soon as the power that any one of Odette’s sentences had to make Swann\nsuffer seemed to be nearly exhausted, lo and behold another, one of those\nto which he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a new sentence, came\nto relieve the first, and to strike at him with undiminished force. The\nmemory of the evening on which he had dined with the Princesse des Laumes\nwas painful to him, but it was no more than the centre, the core of his\npain. That radiated vaguely round about it, overflowing into all the\npreceding and following days. And on whatever point in it he might intend\nhis memory to rest, it was the whole of that season, during which the\nVerdurins had so often gone to dine upon the Island in the Bois, that\nsprang back to hurt him.  So violently, that by slow degrees the curiosity\nwhich his jealousy was ever exciting in him was neutralised by his fear of\nthe fresh tortures which he would be inflicting upon himself were he to\nsatisfy it. He recognised that all the period of Odette’s life which had\nelapsed before she first met him, a period of which he had never sought to\nform any picture in his mind, was not the featureless abstraction which he\ncould vaguely see, but had consisted of so many definite, dated years,\neach crowded with concrete incidents. But were he to learn more of them,\nhe feared lest her past, now colourless, fluid and supportable, might\nassume a tangible, an obscene form, with individual and diabolical\nfeatures. And he continued to refrain from seeking a conception of it, not\nany longer now from laziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. He hoped\nthat, some day, he might be able to hear the Island in the Bois, or the\nPrincesse des Laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old\nrending pain; meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke Odette into\nfurnishing him with fresh sentences, with the names of more places and\npeople and of different events, which, when his malady was still scarcely\nhealed, would make it break out again in another form.",
        "But, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded, now,\nto learn, it was Odette herself who, spontaneously and without thought of\nwhat she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her vices made\nbetween her actual life and the comparatively innocent life which Swann\nhad believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead, was far wider\nthan she knew. A vicious person, always affecting the same air of virtue\nbefore people whom he is anxious to keep from having any suspicion of his\nvices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which he may ascertain bow\nfar those vices (their continuous growth being imperceptible by himself)\nhave gradually segregated him from the normal ways of life. In the course\nof their cohabitation, in Odette’s mind, with the memory of those of her\nactions which she concealed from Swann, her other, her innocuous actions\nwere gradually coloured, infected by these, without her being able to\ndetect anything strange in them, without their causing any explosion in\nthe particular region of herself in which she made them live, but when she\nrelated them to Swann, he was overwhelmed by the revelation of the\nduplicity to which they pointed. One day, he was trying–without hurting\nOdette–to discover from her whether she had ever had any dealings with\nprocuresses. He was, as a matter of fact, convinced that she had not; the\nanonymous letter had put the idea into his mind, but in a purely\nmechanical way; it had been received there with no credulity, but it had,\nfor all that, remained there, and Swann, wishing to be rid of the\nburden–a dead weight, but none the less disturbing–of this suspicion,\nhoped that Odette would now extirpate it for ever.",
        "“Oh dear, no! Not that they don’t simply persecute me to go to them,” her\nsmile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it was\nimpossible should appear legitimate to Swann. “There was one of them\nwaited more than two hours for me yesterday, said she would give me any\nmoney I asked. It seems, there’s an Ambassador who said to her, ’I’ll kill\nmyself if you don’t bring her to me’–meaning me! They told her I’d gone\nout, but she waited and waited, and in the end I had to go myself and\nspeak to her, before she’d go away. I do wish you could have seen the way\nI tackled her; my maid was in the next room, listening, and told me I\nshouted fit to bring the house down:–’But when you hear me say that I\ndon’t want to! The idea of such a thing, I don’t like it at all! I should\nhope I’m still free to do as I please and when I please and where I\nplease! If I needed the money, I could understand...’ The porter has\norders not to let her in again; he will tell her that I am out of town.\nOh, I do wish I could have had you hidden somewhere in the room while I\nwas talking to her.  I know, you’d have been pleased, my dear. There’s\nsome good in your little Odette, you see, after all, though people do say\nsuch dreadful things about her.”",
        "Besides, her very admissions–when she made any–of faults which she\nsupposed him to have discovered, rather served Swann as a starting-point\nfor fresh doubts than they put an end to the old. For her admissions never\nexactly coincided with his doubts. In vain might Odette expurgate her\nconfession of all its essential part, there would remain in the\naccessories something which Swann had never yet imagined, which crushed\nhim anew, and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his\njealousy.  And these admissions he could never forget. His spirit carried\nthem along, cast them aside, then cradled them again in its bosom, like\ncorpses in a river. And they poisoned it.",
        "She spoke to him once of a visit that Forcheville had paid her on the day\nof the Paris-Murcie Fête. “What! you knew him as long ago as that?  Oh,\nyes, of course you did,” he corrected himself, so as not to shew that he\nhad been ignorant of the fact. And suddenly he began to tremble at the\nthought that, on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête, when he had received\nthat letter which he had so carefully preserved, she had been having\nluncheon, perhaps, with Forcheville at the Maison d’Or. She swore that she\nhad not. “Still, the Maison d’Or reminds me of something or other which, I\nknew at the time, wasn’t true,” he pursued, hoping to frighten her. “Yes\nthat I hadn’t been there at all that evening when I told you I had just\ncome from there, and you had been looking for me at Prévost’s,” she\nreplied (judging by his manner that he knew) with a firmness that was\nbased not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity, a fear of crossing\nSwann, which her own self-respect made her anxious to conceal, and a\ndesire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if she chose. And so\nshe struck him with all the sharpness and force of a headsman wielding his\naxe, and yet could not be charged with cruelty, since she was quite\nunconscious of hurting him; she even began to laugh, though this may\nperhaps, it is true, have been chiefly to keep him from thinking that she\nwas ashamed, at all, or confused. “It’s quite true, I hadn’t been to the\nMaison Dorée. I was coming away from Forcheville’s. I had, really, been to\nPrévost’s–that wasn’t a story–and he met me there and asked me to come\nin and look at his prints. But some one else came to see him. I told you\nthat I was coming from the Maison d’Or because I was afraid you might be\nangry with me. It was rather nice of me, really, don’t you see? I admit, I\ndid wrong, but at least I’m telling you all about it now, a’n’t I? What\nhave I to gain by not telling you, straight, that I lunched with him on\nthe day of the Paris-Murcie Fête, if it were true? Especially as at that\ntime we didn’t know one another quite so well as we do now, did we, dear?”",
        "He smiled back at her with the sudden, craven weakness of the utterly\nspiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him. And so,\neven in the months of which he had never dared to think again, because\nthey had been too happy, in those months when she had loved him, she was\nalready lying to him! Besides that moment (that first evening on which\nthey had “done a cattleya”) when she had told him that she was coming from\nthe Maison Dorée, how many others must there have been, each of them\ncovering a falsehood of which Swann had had no suspicion.  He recalled how\nshe had said to him once: “I need only tell Mme. Verdurin that my dress\nwasn’t ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.” From\nhimself too, probably, many times when she had glibly uttered such words\nas explain a delay or justify an alteration of the hour fixed for a\nmeeting, those moments must have hidden, without his having the least\ninkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had had with some other\nman, some man to whom she had said: “I need only tell Swann that my dress\nwasn’t ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.” And\nbeneath all his most pleasant memories, beneath the simplest words that\nOdette had ever spoken to him in those old days, words which he had\nbelieved as though they were the words of a Gospel, beneath her daily\nactions which she had recounted to him, beneath the most ordinary places,\nher dressmaker’s flat, the Avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he could feel\n(dissembled there, by virtue of that temporal superfluity which, after the\nmost detailed account of how a day has been spent, always leaves something\nover, that may serve as a hiding place for certain unconfessed actions),\nhe could feel the insinuation of a possible undercurrent of falsehood\nwhich debased for him all that had remained most precious, his happiest\nevenings, the Rue La Pérouse itself, which Odette must constantly have\nbeen leaving at other hours than those of which she told him; extending\nthe power of the dark horror that had gripped him when he had heard her\nadmission with regard to the Maison Dorée, and, like the obscene creatures\nin the ’Desolation of Nineveh,’ shattering, stone by stone, the whole\nedifice of his past.... If, now, he turned aside whenever his memory\nrepeated the cruel name of the Maison Dorée it was because that name\nrecalled to him, no longer, as, such a little time since, at Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte’s party, the good fortune which he long had lost, but a\nmisfortune of which he was now first aware. Then it befell the Maison\nDorée, as it had befallen the Island in the Bois, that gradually its name\nceased to trouble him. For what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy\nare, neither of them, single, continuous and individual passions. They are\ncomposed of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each\nof which is ephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give\nus the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity.  The life of\nSwann’s love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of\ninfidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which had\nOdette for their object. If he had remained for any length of time without\nseeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by others. But\nthe presence of Odette continued to sow in Swann’s heart alternate seeds\nof love and suspicion.",
        "On certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of\nwhich she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage,\nunder penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; he must\ninstantly accompany her home, to “do a cattleya,” and the desire which she\npretended to have for him was so sudden, so inexplicable, so imperious,\nthe kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative and so\nunfamiliar, that this brutal and unnatural fondness made Swann just as\nunhappy as any lie or unkind action. One evening when he had thus, in\nobedience to her command, gone home with her, and while she was\ninterspersing her kisses with passionate words, in strange contrast to her\nhabitual coldness, he thought suddenly that he heard a sound; he rose,\nsearched everywhere and found nobody, but he had not the courage to return\nto his place by her side; whereupon she, in a towering rage, broke a vase,\nwith “I never can do anything right with you, you impossible person!” And\nhe was left uncertain whether she had not actually had some man concealed\nin the room, whose jealousy she had wished to wound, or else to inflame\nhis senses.",
        "Sometimes he repaired to ’gay’ houses, hoping to learn something about\nOdette, although he dared not mention her name. “I have a little thing\nhere, you’re sure to like,” the ’manageress’ would greet him, and he would\nstay for an hour or so, talking dolefully to some poor girl who sat there\nastonished that he went no further. One of them, who was still quite young\nand attractive, said to him once, “Of course, what I should like would be\nto find a real friend, then he might be quite certain, I should never go\nwith any other men again.” “Indeed, do you think it possible for a woman\nreally to be touched by a man’s being in love with her, and never to be\nunfaithful to him?” asked Swann anxiously. “Why, surely! It all depends on\ntheir characters!” Swann could not help making the same remarks to these\ngirls as would have delighted the Princesse des Laumes. To the one who was\nin search of a friend he said, with a smile: “But how nice of you, you’ve\nput on blue eyes, to go with your sash.” “And you too, you’ve got blue\ncuffs on.” “What a charming conversation we are having, for a place of\nthis sort! I’m not boring you, am I; or keeping you?” “No, I’ve nothing to\ndo, thank you. If you bored me I should say so. But I love hearing you\ntalk.” “I am highly flattered.... Aren’t we behaving prettily?” he asked\nthe ’manageress,’ who had just looked in. “Why, yes, that’s just what I\nwas saying to myself, how sensibly they’re behaving! But that’s how it is!\nPeople come to my house now, just to talk. The Prince was telling me, only\nthe other day, that he’s far more comfortable here than with his wife.  It\nseems that, nowadays, all the society ladies are like that; a perfect\nscandal, I call it. But I’ll leave you in peace now, I know when I’m not\nwanted,” she ended discreetly, and left Swann with the girl who had the\nblue eyes. But presently he rose and said good-bye to her. She had ceased\nto interest him. She did not know Odette.",
        "The painter having been ill, Dr. Cottard recommended a sea-voyage; several\nof the ’faithful’ spoke of accompanying him; the Verdurins could not face\nthe prospect of being left alone in Paris, so first of all hired, and\nfinally purchased a yacht; thus Odette was constantly going on a cruise.\nWhenever she had been away for any length of time, Swann would feel that\nhe was beginning to detach himself from her, but, as though this moral\ndistance were proportionate to the physical distance between them,\nwhenever he heard that Odette had returned to Paris, he could not rest\nwithout seeing her. Once, when they had gone away, as everyone thought,\nfor a month only, either they succumbed to a series of temptations, or\nelse M.  Verdurin had cunningly arranged everything beforehand, to please\nhis wife, and disclosed his plans to the ’faithful’ only as time went on;\nanyhow, from Algiers they flitted to Tunis; then to Italy, Greece,\nConstantinople, Asia Minor. They had been absent for nearly a year, and\nSwann felt perfectly at ease and almost happy. Albeit M. Verdurin had\nendeavoured to persuade the pianist and Dr. Cottard that their respective\naunt and patients had no need of them, and that, in any event, it was most\nrash to allow Mme. Cottard to return to Paris, where, Mme. Verdurin\nassured him, a revolution had just broken out, he was obliged to grant\nthem their liberty at Constantinople. And the painter came home with them.\nOne day, shortly after the return of these four travellers, Swann, seeing\nan omnibus approach him, labelled ’Luxembourg,’ and having some business\nthere, had jumped on to it and had found himself sitting opposite Mme.\nCottard, who was paying a round of visits to people whose ’day’ it was, in\nfull review order, with a plume in her hat, a silk dress, a muff, an\numbrella (which do for a parasol if the rain kept off), a card-case, and a\npair of white gloves fresh from the cleaners. Wearing these badges of\nrank, she would, in fine weather, go on foot from one house to another in\nthe same neighbourhood, but when she had to proceed to another district,\nwould make use of a transfer-ticket on the omnibus. For the first minute\nor two, until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched\nsurface of the doctor’s-wife, not being certain, either, whether she ought\nto mention the Verdurins before Swann, she produced, quite naturally, in\nher slow and awkward, but not unattractive voice, which, every now and\nthen, was completely drowned by the rattling of the omnibus, topics\nselected from those which she had picked up and would repeat in each of\nthe score of houses up the stairs of which she clambered in the course of\nan afternoon.",
        "“I needn’t ask you, M. Swann, whether a man so much in the movement as\nyourself has been to the Mirlitons, to see the portrait by Machard that\nthe whole of Paris is running after. Well, and what do you think of it?\nWhose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse? It’s the same\nin every house in Paris now, no one will speak of anything else but\nMachard’s portrait; you aren’t smart, you aren’t really cultured, you\naren’t up-to-date unless you give an opinion on Machard’s portrait.”",
        "Swann having replied that he had not seen this portrait, Mme. Cottard was\nafraid that she might have hurt his feelings by obliging him to confess\nthe omission.",
        "“Oh, that’s quite all right! At least you have the courage to be quite\nfrank about it. You don’t consider yourself disgraced because you haven’t\nseen Machard’s portrait. I do think that so nice of you. Well now, I have\nseen it; opinion is divided, you know, there are some people who find it\nrather laboured, like whipped cream, they say; but I think it’s just\nideal.  Of course, she’s not a bit like the blue and yellow ladies that\nour friend Biche paints. That’s quite clear. But I must tell you,\nperfectly frankly (you’ll think me dreadfully old-fashioned, but I always\nsay just what I think), that I don’t understand his work. I can quite see\nthe good points there are in his portrait of my husband; oh, dear me, yes;\nand it’s certainly less odd than most of what he does, but even then he\nhad to give the poor man a blue moustache! But Machard! Just listen to\nthis now, the husband of my friend, I am on my way to see at this very\nmoment (which has given me the very great pleasure of your company), has\npromised her that, if he is elected to the Academy (he is one of the\nDoctor’s colleagues), he will get Machard to paint her portrait. So she’s\ngot something to look forward to! I have another friend who insists that\nshe’d rather have Leloir.  I’m only a wretched Philistine, and I’ve no\ndoubt Leloir has perhaps more knowledge of painting even than Machard. But\nI do think that the most important thing about a portrait, especially when\nit’s going to cost ten thousand francs, is that it should be like, and a\npleasant likeness, if you know what I mean.”",
        "Having exhausted this topic, to which she had been inspired by the\nloftiness of her plume, the monogram on her card-case, the little number\ninked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner, and the difficulty of\nspeaking to Swann about the Verdurins, Mme. Cottard, seeing that they had\nstill a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the Rue\nBonaparte, where the conductor was to set her down, listened to the\npromptings of her heart, which counselled other words than these.",
        "“Your ears must have been burning,” she ventured, “while we were on the\nyacht with Mme. Verdurin. We were talking about you all the time.”",
        "Swann was genuinely astonished, for he supposed that his name was never\nuttered in the Verdurins’ presence.",
        "“You see,” Mme. Cottard went on, “Mme. de Crécy was there; need I say\nmore? When Odette is anywhere it’s never long before she begins talking\nabout you. And you know quite well, it isn’t nasty things she says.  What!\nyou don’t believe me!” she went on, noticing that Svrann looked sceptical.\nAnd, carried away by the sincerity of her conviction, without putting any\nevil meaning into the word, which she used purely in the sense in which\none employs it to speak of the affection that unites a pair of friends:\n“Why, she adores you! No, indeed; I’m sure it would never do to say\nanything against you when she was about; one would soon be taught one’s\nplace! Whatever we might be doing, if we were looking at a picture, for\ninstance, she would say, ’If only we had him here, he’s the man who could\ntell us whether it’s genuine or not. There’s no one like him for that.’\nAnd all day long she would be saying, ’What can he be doing just now?  I\ndo hope, he’s doing a little work! It’s too dreadful that a fellow with\nsuch gifts as he has should be so lazy.’ (Forgive me, won’t you.) ’I can\nsee him this very moment; he’s thinking of us, he’s wondering where we\nare.’ Indeed, she used an expression which I thought very pretty at the\ntime.  M. Verdurin asked her, ’How in the world can you see what he’s\ndoing, when he’s a thousand miles away?’ And Odette answered, ’Nothing is\nimpossible to the eye of a friend.’",
        "“No, I assure you, I’m not saying it just to flatter you; you have a true\nfriend in her, such as one doesn’t often find. I can tell you, besides, in\ncase you don’t know it, that you’re the only one. Mme. Verdurin told me as\nmuch herself on our last day with them (one talks more freely, don’t you\nknow, before a parting), ’I don’t say that Odette isn’t fond of us, but\nanything that we may say to her counts for very little beside what Swann\nmight say.’ Oh, mercy, there’s the conductor stopping for me; here have I\nbeen chatting away to you, and would have gone right past the Rue\nBonaparte, and never noticed... Will you be so very kind as to tell me\nwhether my plume is straight?”",
        "And Mme. Cottard withdrew from her muff, to offer it to Swann, a\nwhite-gloved hand from which there floated, with a transier-ticket, an\natmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with the\nharsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. And Swann felt himself overflowing\nwith gratitude to her, as well as to Mme. Verdurin (and almost to Odette,\nfor the feeling that he now entertained for her was no longer tinged with\npain, was scarcely even to be described, now, as love), while from the\nplatform of the omnibus he followed her with loving eyes, as she gallantly\nthreaded her way along the Rue Bonaparte, her plume erect, her skirt held\nup in one hand, while in the other she clasped her umbrella and her\ncard-case, so that its monogram could be seen, her muff dancing in the air\nbefore her as she went.",
        "To compete with and so to stimulate the moribund feelings that Swann had\nfor Odette, Mme. Cottard, a wiser physician, in this case, than ever her\nhusband would have been, had grafted among them others more normal,\nfeelings of gratitude, of friendship, which in Swann’s mind were to make\nOdette seem again more human (more like other women, since other women\ncould inspire the same feelings in him), were to hasten her final\ntransformation back into that Odette, loved with an undisturbed affection,\nwho had taken him home one evening after a revel at the painter’s, to\ndrink orangeade with Forcheville, that Odette with whom Swann had\ncalculated that he might live in happiness.",
        "In former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come\nwhen he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had determined to keep a\nsharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to escape\nhim, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. But now, to the faintness\nof his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in his desire to\nremain her lover. For a man cannot change, that is to say become another\nperson, while he continues to obey the dictates of the self which he has\nceased to be. Occasionally the name, if it caught his eye in a newspaper,\nof one of the men whom he supposed to have been Odette’s lovers,\nreawakened his jealousy. But it was very slight, and, inasmuch as it\nproved to him that he had not completely emerged from that period in which\nhe had so keenly suffered–though in it he had also known a way of feeling\nso intensely happy–and that the accidents of his course might still\nenable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily and at a distance,\nof its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything, an agreeable thrill,\nas to the sad Parisian, when he has left Venice behind him and must return\nto France, a last mosquito proves that Italy and summer are still not too\nremote. But, as a rule, with this particular period of his life from which\nhe was emerging, when he made an effort, if not to remain in it, at least\nto obtain, while still he might, an uninterrupted view of it, he\ndiscovered that already it was too late; he would have looked back to\ndistinguish, as it might be a landscape that was about to disappear, that\nlove from which he had departed, but it is so difficult to enter into a\nstate of complete duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle\nof a feeling which one has ceased to possess, that very soon, the clouds\ngathering in his brain, he could see nothing, he would abandon the\nattempt, would take the glasses from his nose and wipe them; and he told\nhimself that he would do better to rest for a little, that there would be\ntime enough later on, and settled back into his corner with as little\ncuriosity, with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap\ndown over his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway-carriage that is\ndrawing him, he feels, faster and faster, out of the country in which he\nhas lived for so long, and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip\naway from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. Indeed, like\nthe same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the frontier\nand is again in France, when Swann happened to alight, close at hand, upon\nsomething which proved that Forcheville had been Odette’s lover, he\ndiscovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now utterly remote,\nand he regretted that he had had no warning of the moment in which he had\nemerged from it for ever. And just as, before kissing Odette for the first\ntime, he had sought to imprint upon his memory the face that for so long\nhad been familiar, before it was altered by the additional memory of their\nkiss, so he could have wished–in thought at least–to have been in a\nposition to bid farewell, while she still existed, to that Odette who had\ninspired love in him and jealousy, to that Odette who had caused him so to\nsuffer, and whom now he would never see again.  He was mistaken. He was\ndestined to see her once again, a few weeks later.  It was while he was\nasleep, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr.\nCottard, a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter,\nOdette, Napoleon III and my grandfather, along a path which followed the\nline of the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a\nfew feet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of\nthe party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to\nthose who were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was\nfailing, and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on\nthem. Now and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and Swann could\nfeel on his cheek a shower of freezing spray. Odette told him to wipe this\noff, but he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as\nwell as because he was in his nightshirt. He hoped that, in the darkness,\nthis might pass unnoticed; Mme. Verdurin, however, fixed her astonished\ngaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change its\nshape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy\nmoustache. He turned away to examine Odette; her cheeks were pale, with\nlittle fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she\nlooked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach\nthemselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he loved\nher so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him at once.\nSuddenly Odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch, and said: “I\nmust go.” She took leave of everyone, in the same formal manner, without\ntaking Swann aside, without telling him where they were to meet that\nevening, or next day. He dared not ask, he would have liked to follow her,\nhe was obliged, without turning back in her direction, to answer with a\nsmile some question by Mme. Verdurin; but his heart was frantically\nbeating, he felt that he now hated Odette, he would gladly have crushed\nthose eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly, have torn the\nblood into those lifeless cheeks. He continued to climb with Mme.\nVerdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from Odette, who\nwas going downhill, and in the other direction. A second passed and it was\nmany hours since she had left him. The painter remarked to Swann that\nNapoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. “They had\nobviously arranged it between them,” he added; “they must have agreed to\nmeet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn’t say good-bye together; it\nmight have looked odd. She is his mistress.” The strange young man burst\ninto tears. Swann endeavoured to console him. “After all, she is quite\nright,” he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off\nthe fez to make him feel more at ease. “I’ve advised her to do that,\nmyself, a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to\nunderstand her.” So Swann reasoned with himself, for the young man whom he\nhad failed, at first, to identify, was himself also; like certain\nnovelists, he had distributed his own personality between two characters,\nhim who was the ’first person’ in the dream, and another whom he saw\nbefore him, capped with a fez.",
        "As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association of\nideas, then a certain modification of the Baron’s usual physiognomy, and\nlastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his breast, had\nmade Swann give that name; but actually, and in everything that the person\nwho appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him, it was indeed\nForcheville. For, from an incomplete and changing set of images, Swann in\nhis sleep drew false deductions, enjoying, at the same time, such creative\npower that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple act of division,\nlike certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he felt in his own palm\nhe modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought that he was\nclasping, and out of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet\nconscious, he brought about sudden vicissitudes which, by a chain of\nlogical sequences, would produce, at definite points in his dream, the\nperson required to receive his love or to startle him awake. In an instant\nnight grew black about him; an alarum rang, the inhabitants ran past him,\nescaping from their blazing houses; he could hear the thunder of the\nsurging waves, and also of his own heart, which, with equal violence, was\nanxiously beating in his breast. Suddenly the speed of these palpitations\nredoubled, he felt a pain, a nausea that were inexplicable; a peasant,\ndreadfully burned, flung at him as he passed: “Come and ask Charlus where\nOdette spent the night with her friend. He used to go about with her, and\nshe tells him everything. It was they that started the fire.” It was his\nvalet, come to awaken him, and saying:–-",
        "“Sir, it is eight o’clock, and the barber is here. I have told him to call\nagain in an hour.”",
        "But these words, as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which\nSwann was submerged, did not reach his consciousness without undergoing\nthat refraction which turns a ray of light, at the bottom of a bowl of\nwater, into another sun; just as, a moment earlier, the sound of the\ndoor-bell, swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the clangour\nof an alarum, had engendered the episode of the fire. Meanwhile the\nscenery of his dream-stage scattered in dust, he opened his eyes, heard\nfor the last time the boom of a wave in the sea, grown very distant. He\ntouched his cheek. It was dry. And yet he could feel the sting of the cold\nspray, and the taste of salt on his lips. He rose, and dressed himself. He\nhad made the barber come early because he had written, the day before, to\nmy grandfather, to say that he was going, that afternoon, to Combray,\nhaving learned that Mme. de Cambremer–Mlle. Legrandin that had been–was\nspending a few days there. The association in his memory of her young and\ncharming face with a place in the country which he had not visited for so\nlong, offered him a combined attraction which had made him decide at last\nto leave Paris for a while. As the different changes and chances that\nbring us into the company of certain other people in this life do not\ncoincide with the periods in which we are in love with those people, but,\noverlapping them, may occur before love has begun, and may be repeated\nafter love is ended, the earliest appearances, in our life, of a creature\nwho is destined to afford us pleasure later on, assume retrospectively in\nour eyes a certain value as an indication, a warning, a presage. It was in\nthis fashion that Swann had often carried back his mind to the image of\nOdette, encountered in the theatre, on that first evening when he had no\nthought of ever seeing her again–and that he now recalled the party at\nMme. de Saint-Euverte’s, at which he had introduced General de\nFrober-ville to Mme. de Cambremer. So manifold are our interests in life\nthat it is not uncommon that, on a single occasion, the foundations of a\nhappiness which does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with\naggravations of a grief from which we are still suffering. And, no doubt,\nthat might have occurred to Swann elsewhere than at Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte’s. Who, indeed, can say whether, in the event of his having\ngone, that evening, somewhere else, other happinesses, other griefs would\nnot have come to him, which, later, would have appeared to have been\ninevitable? But what did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had\nindeed taken place, and he was not far short of seeing something\nprovidential in the fact that he had at last decided to go to Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte’s that evening, because his mind, anxious to admire the\nrichness of invention that life shews, and incapable of facing a difficult\nproblem for any length of time, such as to discover what, actually, had\nbeen most to be wished for, came to the conclusion that the sufferings\nthrough which he had passed that evening, and the pleasures, at that time\nunsuspected, which were already being brought to birth,–the exact balance\nbetween which was too difficult to establish–were linked by a sort of\nconcatenation of necessity.",
        "But while, an hour after his awakening, he was giving instructions to the\nbarber, so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become disarranged on\nthe journey, he thought once again of his dream; he saw once again, as he\nhad felt them close beside him, Odette’s pallid complexion, her too thin\ncheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, all the things which–in the\ncourse of those successive bursts of affection which had made of his\nenduring love for Odette a long oblivion of the first impression that he\nhad formed of her–he had ceased to observe after the first few days of\ntheir intimacy, days to which, doubtless, while he slept, his memory had\nreturned to seek the exact sensation of those things. And with that old,\nintermittent fatuity, which reappeared in him now that he was no longer\nunhappy, and lowered, at the same time, the average level of his morality,\nhe cried out in his heart: “To think that I have wasted years of my life,\nthat I have longed for death, that the greatest love that I have ever\nknown has been for a woman who did not please me, who was not in my\nstyle!”",
