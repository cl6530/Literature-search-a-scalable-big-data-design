        "There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\ndaughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was\nher own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,\nbecause she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty\napron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and\ntold her mother that she must and would have that apron. ’Be quiet, my\nchild,’ said the old woman, ’and you shall have it. Your stepsister\nhas long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and\ncut her head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the\nbed, and push her well to the front.’ It would have been all over with\nthe poor girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and\nheard everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when\nbedtime had come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to\nlie at the far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her\ngently to the front, and took for herself the place at the back, close\nby the wall. In the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an\naxe in her right hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were\nlying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe with both hands,\nand cut her own child’s head off.",
        "When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart,\nwho was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she\nsaid to him: ’Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my\nstepmother wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When\ndaylight comes, and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.’\n’But,’ said Roland, ’I counsel you first to take away her magic wand,\nor we cannot escape if she pursues us.’ The maiden fetched the magic\nwand, and she took the dead girl’s head and dropped three drops of\nblood on the ground, one in front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and\none on the stairs. Then she hurried away with her lover.",
        "When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\nwanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch\ncried: ’Where are you?’ ’Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’ answered\nthe first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the\nstairs, and cried again: ’Where are you?’ ’Here in the kitchen, I am\nwarming myself,’ cried the second drop of blood. She went into the\nkitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: ’Where are you?’ ’Ah,\nhere in the bed, I am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood. She\nwent into the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,\nwhose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into a\npassion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far\ninto the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her\nsweetheart Roland. ’That shall not help you,’ cried she, ’even if you\nhave got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.’ She put on\nher many-league boots, in which she covered an hour’s walk at every\nstep, and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however,\nwhen she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her\nmagic wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck\nswimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,\nthrew breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;\nbut the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to\ngo home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart\nRoland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the\nwhole night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a\nbeautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her\nsweetheart Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch\ncame striding up towards them, and said to the musician: ’Dear\nmusician, may I pluck that beautiful flower for myself?’ ’Oh, yes,’ he\nreplied, ’I will play to you while you do it.’ As she was hastily\ncreeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower,\nknowing perfectly well who the flower was, he began to play, and\nwhether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a\nmagical dance. The faster he played, the more violent springs was she\nforced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and\npricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she\nhad to dance till she lay dead on the ground.",
        "As they were now set free, Roland said: ’Now I will go to my father\nand arrange for the wedding.’ ’Then in the meantime I will stay here\nand wait for you,’ said the girl, ’and that no one may recognize me, I\nwill change myself into a red stone landmark.’ Then Roland went away,\nand the girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her\nbeloved. But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another,\nwho so fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl\nremained there a long time, but at length, as he did not return at\nall, she was sad, and changed herself into a flower, and thought:\n’Someone will surely come this way, and trample me down.’",
        "It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and\nsaw the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him,\nand laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things\nhappened in the shepherd’s house. When he arose in the morning, all\nthe work was already done, the room was swept, the table and benches\ncleaned, the fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was\nfetched, and at noon, when he came home, the table was laid, and a\ngood dinner served. He could not conceive how this came to pass, for\nhe never saw a human being in his house, and no one could have\nconcealed himself in it. He was certainly pleased with this good\nattendance, but still at last he was so afraid that he went to a wise\nwoman and asked for her advice. The wise woman said: ’There is some\nenchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if anything is\nmoving in the room, and if you see anything, no matter what it is,\nthrow a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be stopped.’",
        "The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,\nhe saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he sprang\ntowards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the\ntransformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,\nwho admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this\ntime she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,\nand as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she\nanswered: ’No,’ for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart\nRoland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not\nto go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.",
        "And now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated,\nand then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced\nthat all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the\nbridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad\nthat she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,\nbut the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to\nsing, she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and\nthen she could not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached\nRoland’s ears, he sprang up and cried: ’I know the voice, that is the\ntrue bride, I will have no other!’ Everything he had forgotten, and\nwhich had vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his\nheart. Then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart\nRoland, and grief came to an end and joy began.",
