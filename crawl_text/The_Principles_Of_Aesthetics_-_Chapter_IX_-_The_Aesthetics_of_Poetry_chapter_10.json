        "Our study of music in the preceding chapter has prepared us for the\nstudy of poetry, for the two arts are akin. Both are arts of sound and\nboth employ rhythm as a principle of order in sound. They had a twin\nbirth in song, and although they have grown far apart, they come\ntogether again in song. In many ways, music is the standard for verse.\nYet, despite these resemblances, the differences between the arts are\nstriking. In place of music’s disembodied feelings, poetry offers us\nconcrete intuitions of life,–the rehearsal of emotions attached to\nreal things and clean-cut ideas. Poetry is a music with a definite\nmeaning, and that is no music at all. Much of poetry, gnomic and\nnarrative, probably grew out of speech by regularizing its natural\nrhythm, independent of music. To-day poetry is written to be read, not\nto be sung; it is an art of speech, not of song.",
        "All speech is communication, an utterance from a speaker to a hearer.\nIn the case of ordinary speech, the aim is to effect some change of\nmind in the interlocutor that will lead to an action beneficial to one\nor both of the persons concerned. Ordinary speech is practical; its\nend is to influence conduct; it is command, exhortation, prayer, or\nthreat. Poetry, on the other hand, is “the spontaneous overflow of\npowerful feelings\"; its purpose is to express life for the sake of the\nvalues which expression itself may create, and to communicate them to\nothers.  [Footnote: Compare F. N. Scott, “The Most Fundamental\nDifferentia of Poetry and Prose,” in Modern Language Association\nPublications, V. 19, pp. 250-269.] The values are given in the\nutterance itself; they do not have to be waited for to come from\nsomething which may develop subsequently. They are the universal\naesthetic values which may result from any free expression of life–the\ncontemplative reliving of its joys, or the mastery of its pains through\nthe courageous facing of them in reflection.",
        "Since the appeal of poetry is to the sympathy and thoughtfulness which\nall men possess, there is no need that it be directed, as ordinary\nspeech is, to particular men and women whose help or advantage is\nsought. The poet addresses himself to man in general, and only so to\nyou and me. Even when ostensibly directed to some particular person,\na poem has an audience which is really universal. Except in the first\nmoment of creative fervor, the friend invoked is never intended to be\nthe sole recipient of the poet’s words. Oftentimes the poet appeals\nto the dead or to natural objects which cannot hear him. One might\nperhaps infer from this that there is no genuine impulse to\ncommunication in poetry; that it is pure expression, a dialogue with\nself. But this would be a false inference; for there is always some\nhint in every poem that a vague background of possible auditors is\nbespoken. No matter how intimate and spontaneous, no poem can escape\nbeing social, and hence, in varying degrees, self-conscious. Art is\nautonomous expression meant to be contagious.",
        "The appeal of scientific expression is also to something universal in\nmen–to their love of knowledge and understanding. But there is this\ndifference between poetry and science: science seeks merely the\nintellectual mastery of things and ideas, and so is careless of their\nvalues; while poetry, even when descriptive or thoughtful, ever has\nlife as its theme–the way man reacts to his environment and his\nthought. Poetry is never purely descriptive or dialectical. And this\ndifference in the substance of the expression determines a difference\nin the direction of interest within the expression. In scientific\nexpression, words lead us away to things–pure description, or to their\nmeanings–mathematics and dialectic; but in poetry, since the values\nwhich we attach to things and ideas come from within out of ourselves\nand are embodied in the words, they keep us to themselves; we dwell\nin the expression itself, in the verbal experience–its total content\nof sounds which we hear, ideas which we understand, and feelings which\nwe appreciate, is of worth to us.",
        "Since poetry is an art of speech, we can understand it only through\na study of words, which are its media. A single word is seldom an\nintegral element of speech; yet it may fairly be called the atom, the\nultimate constituent of speech. Now a word is a structure of a\npotentially fourfold complexity. First, it is a phenomenon of sound\nand movement–something heard and uttered. Its sound, and the\nmovement-sensations from vocal cords and tongue and lips which accompany\nits production, are the sensuous shell of the word. Second, embodied\nin this as the speaker utters it, associated to it as the hearer\nunderstands it, is its meaning. The meaning is either an idea of a\nconcrete thing or situation, or an abstraction. This is the irreducible\nminimum of a word, but is seldom all. For, in poetry, some emotional\nresponse to the object meant by the word impels to its utterance, and\nthis is embodied in it when it is uttered, and a similar feeling is\nawakened in the auditor when it is heard or read. A word not only\nmirrors a situation through its meaning, but preserves something of\nthe mind’s response; it communicates the total experience,–the self\nas well as the object. Finally, the meaning of a word may not remain\na mere idea, but may grow out into one or more of the concrete images\nof which it is the residuum. When, for example, I utter the word\n“ocean,” I may not only know what I mean and re-experience my joy in\nthe sea, but my meaning may be clothed in images of the sight and touch\nand odor of the sea–vicariously, through these images, all my sense\nexperiences of the sea may be present in the mind. A word, therefore,\nsounds and is articulated, means, expresses feeling, and evokes images.\nAll understanding of poetry depends upon the knowledge and proper\nevaluation of the functioning of these aspects of a word. Let us\nconsider in a general way each one of them.",
        "In ordinary speech, the sound and articulation of a word, although\nindispensable to utterance, and therefore a necessary part of it, are\nof little or no value in themselves; for our interest is centered upon\nthe meaning or upon the action which is expected to result from its\nunderstanding. We do not attend to the quality and rhythm of the word-\nsounds which we utter or hear, and the articulatory sensations, although\nfelt, have only a shadowy existence in “the fringe of inattention.\"\nBut in poetry, which is speech made beautiful, the mere sound of the\nwords has value. In hearing poetry, we not only understand, but listen;\nwe appreciate not only the ideas and emotions conveyed, but the\nword-sounds and their rhythms as well. Even in silent reading, poetry\nis a voice which we delight to hear.  [Footnote: And for many this\n“inner speech” consists quite as much of articulation as of sound. The\n“sound” of a word is really a complex of actual sounds plus associated\narticulation impulses. Throughout the remainder of this chapter, when\nI refer to the sound of words, I shall have in mind this entire complex.\nWe may therefore say that in silent reading poetry is a voice which\nwe delight both to hear and to use.]",
        "Yet, despite the importance which sound acquires in poetry, it never\nachieves first place; it never becomes independent, as in music; but\nshares hegemony with the other aspects of the word. In practical or\nscientific speech, the chief aspect is meaning; for it is the meaning\nwhich gives us knowledge and guides our acts. Indeed, for all practical\npurposes, the meaning of words consists in the actions which are to\nbe performed on hearing them. If I ask a man the way and he tells me,\nthe quality of his voice, the interest which he takes in telling me,\nand the images which float across his mind are of no importance to me,\nso long as I can follow his directions. But in poetry the situation\nalters once more. For there, since expression itself has become the\nend, and all action upon it is inhibited, the feeling which prompts\nit becomes a significant part of what I appreciate. In poetry the\nmeanings are secondary to emotions. Yet the meanings are still\nindispensable; for they indicate the concrete objects or ideas towards\nwhich emotion is directed. In ordinary speech, meanings are guides to\naction; in aesthetic speech, they are formulations of feelings. And\njust in this power of a word to fixate emotion lies the chief difference\nbetween poetry and music, where feeling, being aroused by sound alone,\nis vague and objectless.",
        "Ideally, every word in a poem should be charged with feeling; but\nactually this is not the case, for many words, taken by themselves,\nare too abstract or commonplace to possess any. Words all too familiar,\nor connectives, like “and” and “but” and “or,” are examples of this;\nthe former may be avoided by the poet, but the latter are indispensable.\nOriginally, no doubt, every word had an emotional coloring, if only\nthat of a child’s curiosity; and some words have meanings too deeply\nrooted in feeling ever to lose it. No amount of familiarity can deprive\nsuch words as “death” and “love” and “God” of their emotional value.\nWords like these must forever recur in the vocabulary of poets. Yet,\nsince in living discourse a meaning is seldom complete in a single\nword, but requires several words in a phrase or sentence, a word which\nby itself would be cold may participate in the general warmth of the\nwhole of which it is a part. Consider, for example, the last line of\nthe final stanza of Wordsworth’s “The Lost Love”:–",
        "  She lived unknown, and few could know\n     When Lucy ceased to be;\n  But she is in her grave, and O!\n     The difference to me!",
        "The first three words, by themselves, are completely bare of emotional\ncoloring, yet, taken together with the last, and in connection with\nthe whole stanza, and in the setting of the entire poem, they are aglow\nwith the most poignant passion.",
        "As for the image, the last of the aspects of a word, the judgment of\nEdmund Burke, in his “Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful” still remains\ntrue: in reading words or in listening to them, we get the sound and\nthe meaning and their “impressions” (emotions), but the images which\nfloat across the mind, if there are any, are often too vague or too\ninconstant to be of much relevance to the experience. They are,\nmoreover, highly individual in nature, differing in kind and clearness\nfrom person to person. The recent researches into imageless thinking\nare a striking confirmation of Burke’s observation. It is now pretty\nclearly established that the meaning of words is something more than\nthe images, visual or other, which they arouse. Probably the meaning\nis always carried by some sort of imagery, differing with the mental\nmake-up of the reader, but the meaning cannot be equated to the imagery.\nFor example, you and I both understand the word “ocean\"; but when I\nread the word, I get a visual image of green water and sunlight, while\nyou perhaps get an auditory image of the sound of the waves as they\nbreak upon the shore. Sound, meaning, feeling, these are the essential\nconstituents of discourse; imagery is variable and accidental. It is\nimpossible, therefore, to found the theory of poetry on the image-making\npower of words.  [Footnote: For the opposite view, consult Max Eastman:\nThe Enjoyment of Poetry.] And yet, imagery plays a primary role\nin poetic speech. For, as we have observed so often, feelings are more\nvital and permanent when embedded in concrete sensations and images\nthan when attached to abstract meanings. Through the image, the poet\nconfers upon his art some of the sensuousness which it would otherwise\nlack. It is not necessary that the image appear clear in the mind; for\nits emotional value can be conveyed even when it is obscure and\nmarginal. When, for example, we read,",
        "  Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,\n  Thou dost not bite so nigh\n  As benefits forgot,",
        "the word “bitter” may arouse no vivid gustatory image, the word “bite\"\nno clear image of pain; yet even when these images are very dim, they\nserve none the less to establish the feeling of intense disagreeableness\nwhich the poet wishes to convey. Poetry, therefore, because it is more\nemotional than ordinary speech, is more abundantly imaginal.",
        "Having distinguished in a general way the four elements of\nspeech–sound, meaning, feeling, and imagery–we are prepared to study\nthem singly in greater detail. We want to build out of a study of these\nelements a synthetic view of the nature and function of poetry, and\napply our results to some of its newer and more clamant forms. Let us\nbegin with sound. In our first chapter we observed that the medium of\nan art tends to become expressive in itself,–that in poetry the mere\nsound and articulation of words, quite apart from anything which they\nmean, may arouse and communicate feelings. What we have called the\nprimary expressiveness of the medium is nowhere better illustrated\nthan in poetry. But just what is expressed through sound, and how?",
        "Every lover of poetry is aware of the large share which the mere sound\nof the words contributes to its beauty. This is true even when we\nabstract from rhythm, which we shall neglect for the time being, and\nthink only of euphony, alliteration, assonance, and rime. There is a\njoy truly surprising in the mere repetition of vowels and consonants.\nFor myself, I find a pleasure in the mere repetition of vowels and\nconsonants all out of proportion to what, a priori, I should be led\nto expect from so slight a cause. And yet we have the familiar analogies\nby means of which we can understand this seemingly so strange delight,\nthe repeat in a pattern, consonance in chord and melody. If the\nrepetition of the same color or line in painting, the same tone in\nmusic, can delight us, why not the repetition of the same word-sound?\nIn all cases a like feeling of harmony is produced. And the same general\nprinciple applies to explain it. All word-sounds as we utter or hear\nthem leave memory traces in the mind, which are not pure images (no\nmemory traces are), but also motor sets, tendencies or impulses to the\nremaking of the sounds. The doing of any deed–a word is also a\ndeed–creates a will to its doing again; hence the satisfaction when\nthat will is fulfilled in the repeated sound, when the image melts\nwith the fact. And the same law that rules in music and design holds\nhere also: there must not be too much of consonance, of repetition,\nelse the will becomes satiated and fatigued; there must be difference\nas well as identity,–the novelty and surprise which accompany the\narousal of a still fresh and unappeased impulse. This is well provided\nfor in alternate rimes, where the will to one kind of sound is suspended\nby the emergence of a different sound with its will, and where the\nfulfillment of the one balances the fulfillment of the other. All these\nfacts are illustrated in such a stanza as this:–",
        "  Fear no more the heat o’ the sun\n    Nor the furious winter’s rages;\n   Thou thy worldly task hast done,\n    Home art gone and ta’en thy wages;\n   Golden lads and girls all must,\n    As chimney sweepers, come to dust.",
        "Here, for example, the “f\"-sound in “fear” finds harmonious fulfillment\nin “furious\"; the “t\"-sound in “task,” its mate in “ta’en\"; the\n“g\"-sound in “golden,” its match in “girls\"; “sun” and “done,” “rages\"\nand “wages,” illustrate a balance of harmonies; while in the consonance\nof “must” and “dust,” the whole movement of the stanza comes to full\nand finished harmony.",
        "Thus taken together, word-sounds, as mere sounds, are expressive of\nthe general form-feelings of harmony and balance. But can they express\nanything singly? Is there anything in poetry comparable to the\nexpressiveness of single tones or of colors like red and blue and\nyellow? To this, I think, the answer must be, little or nothing. Almost\nall the expressiveness of single words comes from their meaning. At\nall events, the sound and meaning of a word are so inextricably fused\nthat, even when we suspect that it may have some expressiveness on its\nown account, we are nearly incapable of disentangling it. As William\nJames has remarked, a word-sound, when taken by itself apart from its\nmeaning, gives an impression of mere queerness. And when it does seem\nto have some distinctive quality, we do not know how much really belongs\nto the sound and how much to some lingering bit of meaning which we\nhave failed to separate in our analysis. For example, because of its\ninitial “s\"-sound and its hard consonants, the word “struggle” seems\nto express, in the effort required to pronounce it, something of the\nemotional tone of struggle itself; but how do we know that this is not\ndue to the association with its meaning, which we have been unable to\nabstract from? Even true onomatopoetic words like “bang” or “crack\"\nderive, I suspect, most of their specific quality from their meaning.\nThey do have, to be sure, a certain mimetic impressiveness as mere\nsounds; but that is very vague; the meaning makes it specific. The\nsheer length of the word “multitudinous” in Shakespeare’s line, “the\nmultitudinous seas incarnadine,” seems to express something of the\nvastness and prolixity of the seas; but would it if it were not used\nas an adjective describing the seas, and if it did not have just the\nmeaning that it has? Of course, in this case, the mere sound is\neffective, but it gets most of its effectiveness because it happens\nto have a certain meaning. Moreover, even the very sound quality of\nwords depends much upon their meaning; we pronounce them in a certain\nway, with a certain slowness or swiftness, a certain emphasis upon\nparticular syllables, with a high or low intonation, in accordance\nwith the emotion which we feel into them. This is true of the word\n“struggle” just cited. Or consider another example. Take the word\n“blow.” Who, in reading this word in “Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\"\nwould not increase its explosiveness just in order to make its\nexpressiveness correspond to its meaning?",
        "There is, therefore, a fundamental difference in this respect between\nsingle word-sounds and single colors or tones; they are not sufficiently\nimpressive in themselves, not sufficiently separable from their\nmeanings, to have anything except the slightest value as mere sounds.\nIn collocation, however, and quite apart from rhythm and alliteration,\nthis minute expressiveness may add up to a considerable amount. In\nMatthew Arnold’s lines,",
        "  Swept by confused alarms of struggle and flight\n  Where ignorant armies crash by night,",
        "the hardness and difficulty of the consonants in their cumulative force\nbecome an independent element of expressiveness, strengthening that\nof the meaning of the words. Or in Tennyson’s oft-quoted line, “the\nmurmuring of innumerable bees,” the sounds taken together have a genuine\nimitative effect, in which something of the drowsy feeling of the hive\nis present.",
        "Following the general law of harmony between form and content, the\nbeauty of sound should be functional; that is, it should never be\ndeveloped for its own sake alone, but also to intensify, through\nre-expression, the mood of the thoughts. The sound-values are too\nlacking in independence to be purely ornamental. Poetry does indeed\npermit of embellishment–the pleasurable elaboration of sensation–yet\nshould never degenerate into a mere tintinnabulation of sounds. The\nrimes in binding words should bind thoughts also; the tonalities or\ncontrasts of vowel and consonant should echo harmonies or strains in\npervasive moods.",
        "It is by rhythm, however, that the chief expressiveness of the mere\nmedium is imparted to verse. But here again we shall find sound and\nmeaning intertwined–a rhythm in thought governing a rhythm in sound.",
        "Only as a result of recent investigations can a satisfactory theory\nof modern verse be constructed. The making of this theory has been\nlargely hampered, on the one hand, by the application of the\nquantitative principles of classical verse to our poetry; and, on the\nother hand, by forcing the analogy between music and verse. The\ninsufficiency of the quantitative scheme for English verse is not\ndifficult to perceive. Such a scheme presupposes that syllables have\na fixed quantity of duration, as either long or short, and that rhythm\nconsists in the regularity of their distribution. But, although there\nare differences in the duration of syllables, some being longer than\nothers, there are no fixed rules to determine whether a syllable is\nshort or long; and, what is a more serious objection, it is impossible\nto find any regularity in the occurrence of shorts and longs in normal\nEnglish verse,–in all verse that has not been written with the explicit\npurpose of imitating the Greek or Latin. An examination of any line\nof verse will verify these statements. Take, for example, the first\nthree lines of Shakespeare’s song,",
        "  Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\n  Thou art not so unkind\n     As man’s ingratitude.",
        "Here the quantitative scansion is perhaps as follows:–",
        "  - - - - U -\n  - - U x U -\n  U - U - U -",
        "I have given the word “so” a double scansion because I conceive it\nimpossible to determine whether it is really long or short. At any\nrate, there is certainly no regularity in the distribution of shorts\nand longs, except in the last of the three lines, and no correspondence,\nexcept in that line, between the quantitative scansion and the\nrhythmical movement of the verses. And whenever such a correspondence\nexists, it is due either to the fact that the incidence of stress tends\nto lengthen a syllable or to the fact that, oftentimes, in polysyllabic\nwords, mere length will produce a stress. This is the modicum of truth\nin the quantitative view. But obviously stress governs, quantity obeys.",
        "Although the quantitative theory of modern verse has been pretty\ngenerally abandoned, it cannot be said that the ordinary view which\nregards the foot as the unit of verse and its rhythm as determined by\na regular distribution of accented and unaccented syllables, is in a\nmuch better case. For in the first place, by accent is usually meant\nword-accent; but monosyllabic words have no word-accent; hence, in\na succession of such syllables, the accent must be determined by some\nother factor; and, granting this, there is the further fact to be\nreckoned with, that poetic accent is relative–the supposedly unaccented\nsyllable is often very highly accented, more highly in fact than some\nof the so-called accented ones. Consider, for example, the line, “From\nsullen earth sings hymns at heaven’s gate,” where the word “sings,\"\nwhich in accordance with the conventional iambic scansion would be an\nunaccented syllable, is really strongly accented, more strongly, indeed,\nthan “earth” which has an accent. As for the division of the line into\nfeet, that is a pure artifice: who, in the actual reading of the above\nline, would divide the words “sullen” and “heaven” into two parts?",
        "The basis of rhythm is, therefore, not word-accent. Value stress is\nthe basis. [Footnote: Throughout the discussion of rhythm I borrow from\nMark H. Liddell: An Introduction to the Study of Poetry.] Certain\nwords, because of their logical or emotional importance, have a greater\nclaim upon the attention, and this inner stress finds outward expression\nin an increased loudness, duration, and explosiveness of sound. Stress\ncoincides with the word-accent of polysyllabic words because the accent\nis placed on those syllables, usually the root-syllables, which carry\nthe essential meaning. And this stress is not simply present or absent\nin a syllable, but greater in some than in others; in iambic rhythm,\nusually greater in the even than in the preceding odd syllable; in\ntrochaic, greater in the odd than in the immediately preceding even\none. The rhythm is rather an undulation of stresses than an alternation\nof stress and lack of stress, something, therefore, far more complex\nand variegated than the old scheme would imply. And of this undulation,\nnot the foot, but the line is the unit. The character of the undulation\nof the whole line determines the type of the rhythm, which may be very\ndifferent in the case of lines of precisely the same kind of “feet.\"\nFor example, the line quoted above, “From sullen earth sings hymns at\nheaven’s gate,” has a distinctly different rhythm from such another\niambic line as “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” This difference\nis due, in part at least, to the fact that the highest peaks of the\nwave in the former are in the center of the line, in “sings” and\n“hymns,” while in the latter they are at the end, in “summer’s” and\n“day.” This undulation of stress is present in prose and in ordinary\nspeech; for there also there is a rise and fall of stress corresponding\nto the varying values of the words and syllables; but in prose, the\nundulation is irregular, while in poetry, it is regularized.",
        "From the foregoing it is clear that rhythm does not exist in the mere\nsound of the words alone, but in the thought back of them as well. The\nsounds, as such, have no rhythm in themselves; they acquire rhythm\nthrough the subjective processes of significant utterance or listening.\nThe rhythm is primarily in these activities, and from them is\ntransferred to the sounds in which they are embodied. This comes out\nwith additional force when we go farther into the analysis of the\nrhythm of verse. We have just seen that the line is one unit of the\nrhythm (this is true even when there are run-over lines, because we\nmake a slight pause after the ends of such lines too); but within the\nline itself there are sub-units. These sub-units are units of thought.\nEvery piece of written or spoken language is a continuous flow of\nthought. But the movement is not perfectly fluid; for it is broken up\ninto elementary pulses of ideas, following discontinuously upon each\nother. In prose the succession of pulses is complex and irregular,\nwithout any obvious pattern; but in poetry the movement is simple and\nregular and the pattern is clear. Just as in poetry there is a rhythm\nof stress which represents a regularizing of the natural undulations\nin the stress of speech, so there is also a more deep-lying rhythm,\nwhich arises through a simplification and regularizing of the movement\nof thought-pulsations. The fundamental rhythm consists in an alternation\nof subject-group and predicate-group.",
        "This duality, although always retained as basal, may, however, be\nbroken up into a three- or four-part movement whenever the connecting\nlinks between the subject-idea and the predicate-idea acquire sufficient\nimportance, or whenever the one or the other of the two becomes\nsufficiently complex to consist of lesser parts. For example, in\nShakespeare’s thirty-first sonnet, the thought-divisions are three for\neach of the following lines:–",
        "  Thy bosom | is endeared | with all hearts\n  Which I by lacking | have supposed | dead;\n  And there | reigns love, | and all love’s loving parts,\n  And all those friends | which I thought | buried.",
        "These divisions are marked by pauses or casuras.",
        "Here, then, in the regularizing of the number of thought-pulsations,\nwe have another type of rhythm in poetry, and a rhythm which, coming\nfrom within, finds outward expression in sound. Cutting across the\nrhythm of stress, it breaks up the latter with its pauses, and imparts\nto the whole movement variety and richness.",
        "But speech has not only its natural rhythm of stress-undulation and\nthought-pulsations; it has also, as we saw in the last chapter, a\nmelody. The rise and fall of stress goes hand and hand with a rise and\nfall of pitch. The different forms of discourse, and the different\nemotions that accompany them, are each expressed with characteristic\nvariations in pitch. Accepting Wundt’s summary of the facts, we find\nthat, generally speaking, in the declarative statement and the command,\nthe pitch rises in the first thought-division, to fall in the second;\nwhile in the question and the condition, the pitch rises and falls in\nthe first, and then rises again in the second. Doubt, expectation,\ntension, excitement–all the forward looking moods of\nincompleteness–tend to find expression in a rising melody; while\nassurance, repose, relaxation, fulfillment, are embodied in a falling\nmelody. The high tones are dynamic and stimulating; the low tones,\nstatic and peaceful. Now in ordinary speech and prose, the change from\none tone to another is constant and irregular, following the variation\nof mood in the substance of the discourse. How is it with verse? There\nis a simplification and tonality–identity in tone–which is absent\nfrom prose. The melody is more obvious and distinctive, because there\nis a greater simplicity in sentence structure and a higher unity of\nmood. Yet there is no absolute regularity; and the amount of it differs\nwith the different kinds of poetry: there is more in the simple lyric\nthan in the complex narrative; more, for example, in Shakespeare’s\nsonnets than in his dramas. The inexpressible beauty of some lines of\nverse comes doubtless from a fugitive melody which we now grasp, now\nlose.",
        "The existence of speech melody and the tonalities of rime, assonance,\nand alliteration suggest an analogy between verse and music. For some\npeople, this analogy is decisive. Yet the fundamental difference between\nmusic and verse must be insisted on with equal force; the purity of\ntone and fixity of intervals between tones, which is distinctive of\nmusic, is absent from verse. In comparison with music, the melodiousness\nof verse is confused and chaotic; and this condemns to failure any\nattempt to identify the laws of the two arts. Still, we are not yet\nat the end of the analogy. Those who interpret verse in terms of music\nbelieve that, underlying or supplanting the rhythm of stress, there\nis another rhythm, similar to time in music, and capable of expression\nin musical language. There is, it is claimed, an equality of duration\nbetween one line and another, and between one foot in a line and\nanother; these larger and lesser stretches of duration being divided\nup between syllables and pauses, each syllable and pause occupying a\nfixed quantity of time; just as in music each bar is divided up between\nnotes and rests of definite value. Lanier, for example writes the first\nline of Poe’s “Raven” as follows:– [Footnote: The Science of English\nVerse, p. 128.]",
        "  Once up | on a | mid-night | drear-y;",
        "Fascinating as this procedure is, it is nevertheless a distortion of\nthe facts. Poetry is meant to be read, not to be sung; when it is put\nto music and sung, it acquires a character which otherwise does not\nbelong to it. We must not be misled by the historical connection between\nverse and song, nor by the frequency with which some verses are set\nto music. Our poetry must be understood as we experience it to-day,\nnot as it was experienced in its origins. And there is surely much\npoetry which no one wants to sing. No one wants to sing a sonnet or\nMiltonic blank verse. The attempt to apply musical notation to verse\nis a tour de force. Careful observation and experience show that the\nsyllables in verse have no fixed duration values, and that there is no\nconstant ratio between them.",
        "Nevertheless, musical time is not wholly absent from verse. You cannot\nset it to the metronome or express it in musical notation, yet it is\nthere. When lines have the same number of syllables, the time required\nto read them is approximately the same, and we tend to make the duration\nof the thought-divisions equal. Our time-sense is so fallible, we do\nnot notice the departures from exactness; and when the durations of\nprocesses are nearly equal and the values which we attach to them are\nequal, then we are conscious of them as equal. Attention-value and\ntime-value are subjectively equivalent. Words which weigh with us give\nus pause, and we reckon in the time of the pause to make up for a\ndeficiency in the time required to read or utter the syllables. And\nso time-rhythm enters as still another factor in the complex rhythm\nof verse.",
        "The importance of this rhythm differs, however, with the different\nkinds of verse. In lyric poetry closely allied to song, it is clear\nand strong; while in the more reflective and dramatic poetry, it is\nonly an undertone. In some cases, as in the nursery rime,",
        "  Hot cross buns, hot cross buns,\n  If your daughters don’t like ’em,\n  Give ’em to your sons.\n  One a penny, two a penny,\n  Hot cross buns,",
        "there is almost no rhythm of stress, but there is a rhythm of time;\nfor despite the inequality in the number of syllables, each line has\napproximately the same duration, even the last line with its three\nmonosyllabic words being lengthened out into equality with the others.\nThe variety in the rhythm is secured through the unequal number of\nsyllables in the same stretch of duration, the more rapid movement of\nmany syllables being set off over against the slower movement of the\nfew. Similarly, Tennyson’s poem, which should be scanned as I shall\nindicate, has a rhythm which is chiefly musical.",
        "  Break, | break, | break,\n  On thy cold, | grey stones, | O sea!\n  And I would | that my tongue | might utter\n  The thoughts | That arise | in me.",
        "The stresses are nearly even throughout; the meter cannot be accurately\ndescribed as iambic, trochaic, or anapestic; yet there is a rhythm in\nthe approximate temporal equality of the thought-moments. These verses\nare, however, rather songs than poems. The failure to distinguish\nbetween verses which are songs and those which are poems accounts, I\nbelieve, for the extremes to which the musical theory of verse has\nbeen carried.",
        "Still another element of poetry which allies it to music is the\nrepetition of the thought-content. Why repetition should be musical\nwe already know: music is an art which seeks to draw out and elaborate\npure emotion; repetition serves this end by constantly bringing the\nmind back to dwell upon the same theme. Moreover, repetition involves\nretardation; for a movement cannot progress rapidly if it has to return\nupon itself; and this slowness gives time for the full value of a\nfeeling to be worked out. In all the more emotional and lyric poetry\nwe find, therefore, recurrence of theme: the thought is repeated again\nand again; in new forms, perhaps, yet still the same in essence,\nsuccessive lines or stanzas taking up the same burden; sometimes there\nis exact recurrence of thought, as in the refrain. And this repetition\nin the thought is embodied in a repetition of the elements of the\nsound-pattern; the wave type is repeated from verse to verse or recurs\nagain and again; there is recurrence of melodic form or parallelism\nbetween contrasted melodies in different stanzas; there is tonality\nof vowel and consonant sounds in rime and assonance and alliteration;\nthere may be an approach to identity in the time-duration of the various\nunits. Parallelism or repetition is the fundamental scheme of such\npoetry. But between repetition with its retardation of movement and\nprogress towards a goal there is a necessary antagonism; hence in the\nmore dramatic and narrative forms of poetry, although recurrence is\nnever entirely absent, there is less of it, and the movement\napproximates to that of prose. Emotion demands repetition, but action\ndemands progression.",
        "After our analysis of the rhythm of poetry, we are in a position to\ninquire into what can be expressed through it, and how psychologically\nthis expression can be explained.",
        "The expressiveness of rhythm is like that of music, vague and\nobjectless, for which reason rhythm is properly called the music of\nverse. Almost everything in a general way which we have said about the\nexpressiveness of music applies to poetic rhythm. This expressiveness\ncannot be translated into words with any exactness; the most that can\nbe done is to find a set of words into which it will roughly fit,\nleaving much vacant space of meaning. That the emotional values of\nrhythms have character is, however, proved by the fact that some rhythms\nare better vehicles for certain kinds of thought than others are. Yet\nit often happens that, just as, in song or opera, the same melody is\nused to express joy or grief, love or religious emotion, so\napproximately the same rhythmic form is employed in the expression of\napparently antagonistic emotions. Nevertheless, this fact is not fatal\nto expression; for, in the first place, there is much variety of rhythm\nwithin a given metrical form, so that what superficially may seem to\nbe the same rhythm is really a different one; and, in the second place,\nas we have already observed in the case of music, there is much–in\nform and energy of movement–which contrasting emotions have in common,\nand this may be expressed in the rhythmic type. Think of the wide sweep\nof emotions which have been expressed in the sonnet form! Yet consider\nwhat varieties of rhythm and speech melodies are possible within this\nform, and how, nevertheless, there is an identity of character in all\nsonnets–how they are all thoughtful, all restrained, yet unfaltering\nin their movement!",
        "Without going into details, which would lie beyond the scope of general\nsthetics, it is possible to state the following broad facts (compare\nthe similar facts relating to melody) with reference to poetic rhythms:\na rising rhythm expresses striving or restlessness; a falling rhythm,\nquiet, steadfastness. There is, however, no absolute contrast between\nthe two kinds, because a falling rhythm is still a rhythm, and that\nmeans a movement which necessarily contains something of instability\nand unrest. The contrast is sharpest in the anapestic and dactylic,\nless sharp in the trochaic and iambic. Many a trochaic rhythm becomes\nin effect iambic when the division of the thought moments and the\ndistribution of the pauses make the rhythm rise after the first few\nwords; and conversely, many an iambic rhythm becomes trochaic through\na similar shift in the attention. Within a single line, therefore,\nthere may be both rising and falling pulsations. Much of the rare\nbeauty of poetry comes from such subtle combinations of rhythmic\nqualities.",
        "Through time and tempo also, poetic rhythm is expressive, much after\nthe manner of music; by these means too, in addition to the mode of\nstress-undulation, it imitates the temporal and dynamic course of\naction and emotion, and so tends to arouse congruous types of feeling\nin the mind; it is swift or slow, gliding or abrupt, retarded or\naccelerated. Compare the slow and retarded rhythm of “When I have fears\nthat I may cease to be,” so well adapted to express the gravity of the\nthought, with the rapid and accelerated movement of “Hail to thee,\nblithe spirit!” so full of a quick joyousness. Or compare the light\nlegato movement of “Bird of the wilderness, blithesome and cumberless,\"\nwith the heavy staccato movement of “Waste endless and boundless and\nflowerless.”",
        "Yet, for all its expressiveness, the music of verse can never stand\nalone. It is too bare and tenuous by itself to win and keep the\nattention or to evoke much feeling. It does not possess the purity of\ncolor, the loudness, force, or volume of sound that belong to music\nand make music, almost alone of the arts, capable of existing as mere\nform. The rhythm of poetry, derived very largely from a rhythm of\nthought, has need of thought for significance. The thought and the\nmusic are one. For this reason poetry is better, I think, when read\nto oneself than when read aloud; for then the sound and the sense are\nmore intimate; the attention is not drawn off to the former away from\nthe latter. Moreover, try as he will, the poet can never make his\nword-sounds fully harmonious; some roughness and dissonance will remain;\nbut in silent reading these qualities disappear. However, although by\nitself of small significance, the musical element in verse makes all\nthe difference between poetry and prose. Through its own vague\nexpressiveness it fortifies the emotional meaning of the poetic\nlanguage, and, at the same time, sublimates it by scattering it in the\nmedium. And finally it imparts an intimacy, a personal flavor, which\nalso allies poetry with music; for the substance of rhythm is the\nmovement of our own inner processes; the rhythm of thoughts and sounds\nis a rhythm in our own listening and attending, our own thinking and\nfeeling; the emotional values spring from us as well as from the\nsubject-matter. Hence even narrative and dramatic poetry have a lyrical\ntone; we ourselves are implicated in the actions and events portrayed.",
        "The demands made by the form of poetry upon its substance are similar\nto those made by music upon the words in a song, only less stringent.\nThe content must be emotional and significant; it cannot be trite and\ncold. The meaning of words would permit the poet to bring before the\nmind all possible objects, events, and ideas, but the music of words\nwould be incongruous with most of them. Events narrated must be\nstirring, thoughts uttered must be emotionally toned, things described\nmust be related to human life and action. Poetry may desert the royal\nthemes of long ago–arma virumque cano, maenin aeide thea–and\nrelate the lowly life of common folk, even the sordid life of the poor\nand miserable, but when doing so throws over it the musical glamour\nof verse and arouses the heat of sympathy and passion. Although, since\nit makes use of words, poetry should always have a meaning, it need\nnot have the definiteness of meaning of logical thought; it may suggest\nrather than explicate; its music is compatible with vagueness. But\nvagueness is not obscurity; the poet should always make us feel that\nwe understand him; he should not seek to mystify us, or keep us guessing\nat his meaning. Yet, since the poet operates with words and not with\nmere sounds, great subtlety and precision of thought are possible in\npoetry, although not argument and dialectic. Poetry may express the\nresults of reflection, so far as they are of high emotional value, but\ncannot well reproduce its processes; the steps of analysis and inference\nare too cold and hard for the muse to climb.",
        "On the other hand, poetry does not permit of the development and\niteration of pure feeling which we find in music; for poetic rhythms\nand melodies lack the variety and fluency of the musical. Yet poetry\nis capable, where music is not, of expressing brief, quick outbursts\nof feeling; for a few words, by referring to the causes and conditions\nof feeling, may adequately express what music needs time and many tones\nto convey. Poetry wins beauty by concentration, whereas music gains\nby expansion. There is also a similar relation between prose and poetry\nin this respect; the severity of the form imposes upon poetry a\nsimplicity which contrasts with the breadth and complexity of prose.\nAs Schopenhauer remarked, every good poem is short; long poems always\ncontain stretches either of unmusical verse or unpoetic music. Yet,\nin comparison with prose, the tempo of music is slow; we have to linger\nin the medium in order that its rhythmic and tonal beauties may impress\nus, and this slowness of movement is imparted to the thought; even\nnarrative and dramatic poetry suffer retardation; for which reason the\npoetic form must be abandoned if great rapidity of expression is sought.",
        "From our study of the materials and forms of its expression, it becomes\nclear how the subject-matter of poetry is the inner life of mood and\nstriving and passionate human action. Emotions may be poured forth in\nwords, and, by means of words, actions may be described. But neither\npassion nor action appear in poetry as they are lived and enacted; for\nthe poet, working in a medium of words, has to translate them into\nthoughts. Words cannot embody the real experiences which they express;\nexperience is fleeting and falls away from the words, which retain\nonly an echo of what they mean. Only what can be relived in memory can\nbe contained in a word, and not even all of that; for a word is not\na mere embodiment of an experience, but a communication also, and only\nits public and universal content can pass from a speaker to a hearer.\nNow, this socialized content of a word is a thought. Even passion the\nmost spontaneous and lyrical has to be translated into thought,–not\nthe abstract thought of scientific expression, but the emotionally\ntoned thought of art, thought which, while condensing experience, still\nkeeps its values. Emotional thought is the substance of poetry. However,\nalbeit an image of the inner life, poetry does not volatilize it into\npure feeling as music does, but distinguishes its objects and assigns\nits causes. Poetry is concrete and articulate where music is abstract\nand blind. Since words, through their meanings and associated images,\ncan express things as well as man’s reactions to them, poetry can also\nreflect the natural environment of life, its habitat and seat. And\nyet, because the poet has to translate things into ideas, nature never\nappears in poetry as it is in itself, but as it is implicated in mind.\nFor the poet, sea and sky, the woods and plains and rivers, birds and\nflowers, are the symbols of human destiny or the loci of human action.\nEmotion overflows into nature, but this involves the taking up of\nnature into man. Not nature, but man’s thoughtful life is the poet’s\ntheme.",
        "If the foregoing statement is correct, emotional thought rather than\nimagery is the substance of poetry. For poetry, as music with a meaning,\ncan be quite free of definite images. “In la sua volantade e nostra\npace” (In his will is our peace)  [Footnote: Dante: Paradiso,\n3, 85.] is beautiful poetry, yet there is no image. The thought\nformulates a mood and finds a sensuous embodiment in musical language,\nand that suffices for beauty. And yet in poetry, as has been observed,\nthought tends to descend into imagery. By being connected with a\nsensuous material, a thought acquires a firmer support for feeling\nthan it could possess of itself as a mere concept. Especially effective\nis the descent to the lower senses; for they are closest to the roots\nof emotion. Let me recall again the Shakespearean lyric which I have\nquoted before in a similar connection, omitting the last lines of each\nstanza:–",
        "  Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\n  Thou art not so unkind\n   As man’s ingratitude;\n\n  Thy tooth is not so keen\n  Because thou art not seen,\n   Although thy breath be rude.\n\n  Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,\n  Thou dost not bite so nigh\n   As benefits forgot;\n\n  Though thou the waters warp,\n  Thy sting is not so sharp\n   As friend remembered not.",
        "Here are images of cold–winter, freeze; of touch–blow, breath; of\npain–tooth, bite, sting, sharp; of taste–bitter. How vividly they\nconvey the ache of desolation! Only in words which are imaginative as\nwell as musical are the full resources of verbal expression employed.",
        "All the various forms of metaphorical language have the same purpose:\nby substituting for a more abstract, conceptual mode of expression a\nmore sensuous and imaginative one, to vivify the emotional quality of\nthe situation. When Keats sings,",
        "  ... on the shore\n  Of the wide world I stand and think\n  Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink,",
        "he has in mind to convey to us that renunciation of merely personal\nambitions which comes to us when we “survey all time and all existence.\"\nAnd how does he do it? By evoking the image of the wide stretch of the\nshore of the sea, which, making us feel our nothingness as we stand\nand look out upon it, has the same effect, only more poignant. Of the\nworld we have no image–not so, of the shore of the world; and toward\nwhat we cannot imagine we cannot easily feel. Oftentimes the metaphor\nis latent, a mere adjective undeveloped in its implications, as in\n“bitter” sky; yet the purpose is the same. Incidentally the poet unifies\nour world for us through his metaphors; not as the scientist does by\npointing out causal and class relations, but by exhibiting the emotional\naffinities of things. He increases the value of single things by giving\nthem the values of other things. Every metaphor should serve this\npurpose of emotional expression and unification, should be part of an\nemotional thought; otherwise it is a mere tour de force of\ncleverness, unrelated to the poetic interest and intrinsically\nabsurd,–the world has no shore and the wind is not bitter; feeling\nalone can justify such comparisons. Moreover, too many metaphors, or\nmetaphors too elaborately developed, by scattering the attention, or\nby drawing it away from the meaning of which the image should be a\npart, have the effect of no image at all. The poetry of Francis\nThompson, for example, loses rather than gains vitality through its\nimaginative exuberance. We object to decadent poets, not because they\nare sensuous, but because they lack feeling; with them sensation,\ninstead of supporting emotion, supplants it. Such poets seek to atone\nfor their want of vigorous feeling by stimulating our eyes and ears.",
        "If, as I believe, emotional thought rather than imagery is the essence\nof poetry, then the modern school of imagists and their French forbears\namong the “Parnassiens” are mistaken. Their effort comes in the end\nto a revival of the old thesis ut pictura poesis, the attempt\nto make poetry a vision of nature rather than an expression of the\ninner life. They would lead poetry away from the subjectivity of emotion\ninto the outer object world. Now, it is indeed possible for the poet\nto represent nature through the images which words evoke in the mind,\nand these images may have significance for feeling. Their very evocation\nin musical language is bound to lend them some warmth of mood. Yet–as\nLessing showed in his Laocoon, despite all the crabbed narrowness\nof his treatment–it is hopeless for the poet to enter into rivalry\nwith the painter or sculptor. The colors and forms of things which the\npoet paints for the eye of the mind are mere shadows in comparison\nwith those which we really see. [Footnote: The best the poet-painter\ncan do is to express his memories of the outer world; but apart from\nsome vivid emotion, memories are unsatisfactory in comparison with\nrealities.] We admire the marvelous workmanship of such verses as the\nfollowing of Gautier, but they leave us cold; even the melody of the\nlanguage is incapable of making them warm. How poor they are beside\na painting!",
        "  Les femmes passent sous les arbres\n  En martre, hermine et menu-vair\n  Et les deesses, frileux marbres,\n  Ont pris aussi l’abit d’hiver.\n\n  La Venus Anadyomene\n  Est en pelisse a capuchon:\n  Flore, que la brise malmene,\n  Plonge ses mains dans son manchon.\n\n  Et pour la saison, les bergeres\n  De Coysevox et de Coustou,\n  Trouvant leures echarpes legeres\n  Ont des boas autour du cou.",
        "Of course, poetic pictures can be painted–Gautier has painted them–but\nthe standard for each art is set by what it can do uniquely well. If\nthe poet works in the domain of the painter, we tend to judge him by\nthe alien standards of another art, where he is bound to fall short;\nwhile if he works within his own province, we judge him by his own\nautonomous laws, under which he can achieve perfection.",
        "Oftentimes, confessing the inability of the image to stand alone, these\npoets make it into a symbol of some mood or emotional thought. Yet the\nimage remains the chief object of the poet’s care; it was clearly the\nfirst thing in his mind; the interpretation is an afterthought. The\npoem therefore falls into two parts–a picture and an interpretation,\nwith little organic relation between them. Another one of Gautier’s\npoems will serve to illustrate what I mean. [Footnote: There are some\ngood examples of this in Baudelaire’s Fleures du Mat. See for\none,L’Albatros.]",
        "  Sur le coteau, la-bas ou sont les tombes,\n  Un beau palmier, comme un panache vert,\n  Dresse sa tete, ou le soir les colombes\n  Viennent nicher et se mettre a couvert,\n\n  Mais le matin elles quittent les branches;\n  Comme un collier qui s’egrene, on les voit\n\n  S’eparpiller dans Fair bleu, toutes blanches,\n  Et se poser plus loin sur quelque toil.\n\n  Mon ame est l’arbre ou tous les soirs, comme elles,\n  De blancs essaims de folles visions\n  Tombent des cieux, en palpitant des ailes,\n  Pour s’envoler des les premiers rayons.",
        "Finally, the effort to detach poetry from the inner world and make it\nan expression of outer things, is incompatible with its musical\ncharacter. For music is essentially subjective, an expression of pure\nmood unaffixed to objects. As rhythmical, poetry shares the inwardness\nof music; wherefore, unless its rhythm is to be a mere functionless,\nornamental dress, whatever it expresses should have its source in the\ninner man. Of course, through their meanings, word-sounds indicate the\ncauses and objects of emotion–and this differentiates music from\npoetry–but in poetry the emotion is still the primary thing, springing\nfrom inner strivings, and not from objects, as in painting and\nsculpture. It is therefore no accident that the contemporary imagists\ntend to abandon the forms of verse; their poetry has little or no\nregular rhythm; it approximates to prose. For in proportion as poetry\nbecomes free, it ceases to be tied to musical expressiveness, and may\nbecome objective, without prejudice to its own nature. Prose poetry,\nand prose too, of course, may be highly emotional and subjective, for\nwords can express emotions directly without any rhythmical ordering;\nyet prose need not be subjective, as poetry must be. There is no\nabsolute difference between prose and poetry; for even prose has its\nrhythm and its euphony, its expressiveness of the medium; yet in prose\nthe rhythm is irregular and accidental and the expressiveness of the\nmedium incomplete, while in poetry the rhythm is regular and pervasive\nand ideally every sound-element, as mere sound, is musical. But this\nmore complete musical expressiveness of the medium restricts poetry\nto a more inward world.",
        "By abandoning the strict forms and restraints of regular rhythms, the\nwriters of free verse think to gain spontaneity and something of the\namplitude of prose; yet it is doubtful whether they gain as much as\nthey lose. For, in the hands of the skillful poet, the form, having\nbecome second nature, ceases to be a bond; and the expression, by\ntaking on regularity of rhythm, acquires a concentration and mnemonic\nvalue which free verse cannot achieve. In comparison with free verbal\nexpressions, verse forms are, indeed, artifices; yet they are not\nartificial, in the bad sense of functionless, for they possess\nirreplaceable values. Nevertheless, it would be strange if they were\nnot from time to time abandoned, the poet reverting to the freedom of\nordinary speech; just as now and then, in civilized communities, we\nfind vigorous and sincere men who tire of culture and take to the\nwoods.",
        "The triplicity of the word, as sound, image, meaning, provides a certain\njustification for the variety of tastes in poetry, and accounts for\nthe difficulty of setting up a single universal standard. There is an\nunstable equilibrium between the three aspects of words; hence poetry\ntends to become predominantly music or painting or thought, yet can\nnever succeed in becoming completely any one of these. And it is\ninevitable that some people should be more sensitive to one rather\nthan to another of the aspects of words, preferring therefore the more\nmusical, or the more thoughtful, or the more pictorial poetry. And so\nwe have poems that would be music, and others that would be pictures,\nand still others that would be epigrams. And each kind has a certain\nright and beauty; but no kind has the unique beauty that is poetical.\nWe do not ask their makers not to produce them, nor do we condemn the\npleasures which they afford us, but we cannot commend them without\nreservation. For the best poems achieve a synthesis of the elements\nof words,–they are at once musical and imaginative and thoughtful.\nYet with difficulty; for there is an antagonism among the elements:\nwhen the music is insistent, the thought is obscured; when the images\nare elaborate, their meaning is lost to sight; when the thought is\nsubtle or profound, it rejects the image and is careless of sound.\nSwinburne’s poetry is full of philosophy, but is so sensuous and musical\nthat we miss its thoughts; Browning is too subtle a thinker to be a\nmusician. The complexity of poetry is the source of its strength,\nlending it something of the inwardness of music and the plasticity of\nthe pictorial arts; but is also the source of its weakness. Seldom\ndoes it achieve the technical purity and perfection of music and\npainting and sculpture. Music has a clear and simple medium, painting\nand sculpture work with colors and forms which almost are what they\nrepresent; but word-sounds are not what they mean, and what they mean\nis not precisely the same as the images which they evoke; too often\nthe correspondence is factitious and artificial, rarely is there fusion.\nYet, as I have tried to show, when meaning is made central, sound may\nfit it closely, and when the meaning is emotional, the music of sound\nmay echo its cry, and the image, instead of rebelling, may serve.\nEmotional thought is the essence of poetry and the link between its\nmusic and its pictures.",
        "Of the different modes of poetry, the lyric has rightly seemed the\nmost typical. Being an expression of a single, simple mood, its\nsubject-matter is most closely akin to the musical expressiveness of\nthe rhythm and euphony of the medium. When, moreover, the mood is a\ncommon one, there occurs that identification of self with the passion\nexpressed characteristic of music: the utterance becomes ours as well\nas the poet’s; the “I” of the poem is the “I” who read. This is\nespecially true when the setting and causes of the emotion are without\nname or place or date; the poem then shares the timelessness and\nuniversality of music. In such a lyric there is complete symmetry in\nthe relation between speaker and hearer; the poet unburdens his heart\nto us, and we in receiving his message tell it back to him. When, on\nthe other hand, in explaining his feelings, the poet relates them to\nevents and persons which have been no part of our experience, this\nsymmetry is lost; we no longer utter the poem ourselves, but merely\nhear the poet speak. Such poetry is already approaching the dramatic;\nfor although still the expression of the poet’s life, it is no longer\nan expression of the reader’s life, and the poet also, as he lives\npast his experience, must come at length to view it as if it were\nanother’s.",
        "And yet, paradoxical as it may sound, dramatic poetry is dramatic in\nproportion as it is lyrical–that is, according to the degree to which\nthe poet has made the life of others his own. Dramatic poetry, when\ntruly poetic, is a series of lyrics of the less universal type. In\nanother respect, however, dramatic poetry is essentially different\nfrom the lyrical. For, in dramatic poetry, each utterance is a response\nor invitation to another utterance, while in lyric poetry, utterance\nis complete in itself. The one is social, the other personal: in the\nappreciation of the lyric, the reader is just himself; in the\nappreciation of dramatic poetry, he is a whole society, becoming now\nthis man and now that. The unity of the one is the unity of a single\nmood; the unity of the other is the interaction of the dramatis person\nas it works itself out in the mind of the reader. And this difference,\nas we have seen, is imaged in the form. Being self-contained, the lyric\nis a harmonious whole, in which the parts may be repeated for emphasis;\nlooking backward and forward, the dramatic utterance is a progressive\nand incomplete whole, which cannot stay for iteration. Lyric poetry\nis like a communication from friend to friend, intimate and meditative;\ndramatic poetry is like a passionate conversation which one overhears.",
        "The life portrayed in the epic poem is even less direct than that which\nis portrayed in the drama; for there the poet does not impersonate the\nagents in the story, but describes them. His description is the first\nthing which we get; we get the action only indirectly through that.\nHence the story-teller himself–his manner of telling, his reactions\nto what he tells, his sympathy, humor, and intelligence–are part of\nwhat he expresses. He himself is partly theme. No matter how hard he\nmay try to do so, he cannot exclude himself; through his choice of\nwords, through his illustrations, through his style, “which is the\nman,” he will reveal himself.  [Footnote: See Lipps: Aesthetik,\nBd. 1, s. 495 et seq.] We inevitably apprehend, not merely his thoughts,\nbut him thinking. In the epic form of poetry, the poet has, moreover,\nan opportunity for a more direct mode of self-revelation, an opportunity\nfor comment and judgment upon the life which he portrays. And this we\nshould accept, not in a spirit of controversy or criticism, but with\nsympathy, as a part of the total aesthetic expression, striving to get,\nnot only the poet’s story, but his point of view regarding it as well.",
        "This duality in the life of the epic involves a two-foldness in its\ntime. In both lyric and dramatic poetry, life moves before us as a\nsingle stream actual in the present; but in the epic there is the time\nof the story-teller, which is present, and the time of the events that\nhe relates, which is past. And being past, these events appear as it\nwere at a distance, at arms’ length and remote; they lack the vivid\nreality of things present. Moreover, since the past is finished, unlike\nthe present which is ever moving and creating itself anew, the epic,\nin comparison with the drama, comes to us with its parts as it were\ncoexisting and complete, more after the manner of space than of time.\nAnd just as a spatial thing allows us to survey its parts by turn,\nsince they are all there before we look; so, in reading an epic, we\nfeel that we can proceed at our leisure and, despite the causal\nrelation, take the incidents in any order. It is not so in the drama,\nwhere events move rapidly and make themselves in a determined sequence.\nThis is what Goethe meant when he said that substantiality was the\ncategory of the epic, causality of the drama, although, of course,\nthis distinction is not absolute.",
        "Finally, the fact that the epic poet tells rather than impersonates\nhis story, enables him to enlarge its scope; for by means of\ndescriptions he can introduce nature as one of the persons of the\naction.  [Footnote: Compare Munsterberg: The Eternal Values, p.\n233.] He can show the molding influence of nature upon man, and how\nman, in turn, interacts not only with his fellows, but with his\nenvironment. Fate, in the sense of the non-human determinants of man’s\ncareer, can show its hand. In the Odyssey, for example, shipwreck\nand the interference of the gods are factors as decisive as Odysseus’\ncourage and cunning. By contrast, in lyric poetry, nature is merely\na reflection of moods; in dramatic poetry, it is simply the passive,\ncausally ineffective stage for a social experience wholly determined\nby human agents. This distinction is, however, not absolute. In\nBrand, for example, through the stage directions and the\nutterance of the persons, we are indirectly made aware of the control\nexerted by the physical background of the action; in the Greek drama\nwe learn this from the Chorus and the Prologue.",
