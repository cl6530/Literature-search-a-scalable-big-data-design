        "The Indian Drum",
        "  “Oh, that hair of horse and skin of sheep should\n  Have such power to move the souls of men.”",
        "“If you were real Injun you’d make a drum of that,” said Caleb to\nYan, as they came to a Basswood blown over by a recent storm and now\nshowing its weakness, for it was quite hollow–a mere shell.",
        "“How do they do it? I want to know how.”",
        "“Get me the axe.”",
        "Yan ran for the axe. Caleb cut out a straight unbroken section about\ntwo feet long. This they carried to camp.",
        "“Coorse ye know,” said Caleb, “ye can’t have a drum without skins for\nheads.”",
        "“What kind of skins?”",
        "“Oh, Horse, Dog, Cow, Calf–’most any kind that’s strong enough.”",
        "“I got a Calfskin in our barn, an’ I know where there’s another in the\nshed, but it’s all chawed up with Rats. Them’s mine. I killed them\nCalves. Paw give me the skins for killin’ an’ skinnin’ them. Oh, you\njest ought to see me kill a Calf–”",
        "Guy was going off into one of his autopanegyrics when Sam who was now\nbeing rubbed on a sore place, gave a “Whoop!” and grabbed the tow-tuft\nwith a jerk that sent the Third War Chief sprawling and ended the\npanegyric in the usual volley of “you-let-me-’lones.”",
        "“Oh, quit, Sam,” objected Little Beaver. “You can’t stop a Dog\nbarking. It’s his nature.” Then to Guy: “Never mind, Guy; you are not\nhurt. I’ll bet you can beat him hunting Deer, and you can see twice as\nfar as he can.”",
        "“Yes, I kin; that’s what makes him so mad. I’ll bet I kin see three\ntimes as far–maybe five times,” was the answer in injured tones.",
        "“Go on now, Guy, and get the skins–that is, if you want a drum for\nthe war dance. You’re the only one in the crowd that’s man enough to\nmake the raise of a hide,” and fired by this flattery, Guy sped away.",
        "Meanwhile Caleb worked on the hollow log. He trimmed off the bark,\nthen with the hatchet he cleared out all the punk and splinters\ninside. He made a fire on the ground in the middle of the drum-log as\nit stood on end, and watching carefully, he lifted it off from time to\ntime and chopped away all the charred parts, smoothing and trimming\ntill he had the log down thin and smooth within and without. They\nheard Guy shouting soon after he left. They thought him near at hand,\nbut he did not come. Trimming the drum-log took a couple of hours, and\nstill Guy did not return. The remark from Caleb, “’Bout ready for the\nskins now!” called from Sam the explanation, “Guess Old Man Burns\nsnapped him up and put him to weeding the garden. Probably that was\nhim we heard gettin’ licked.”",
        "“Old Man Burns” was a poor and shiftless character, a thin,\nstoop-shouldered man. He was only thirty-five years of age, but, being\nmarried, that was enough to secure for him the title “Old Man.” In\nSanger, if Tom Nolan was a bachelor at eighty years of age he would\nstill be Tom Nolan, “wan of the bhoys,” but if he married at twenty he\nat once became “Old Man Nolan.”",
        "Mrs. Burns had produced the usual string of tow-tops, but several had\ndied, the charitable neighbours said of starvation, leaving Guy, the\neldest, his mother’s darling, then a gap and four little girls, four,\nthree, two and one years of age. She was a fat, fair, easy-going\nperson, with a general sense of antagonism to her husband, who was,\nof course, the natural enemy of the children. Jim Burns cherished the\nideal of bringing “that boy” up right–that is, getting all the work\nhe could out of him–and Guy clung to his own ideal of doing as little\nwork as possible. In this clash of ideals Guy’s mother was his firm,\nthough more or less secret, ally. He was without fault in her eyes:\nall that he did was right. His freckled visage and pudgy face were\ntypes of noble beauty, standards of comeliness and human excellence;\nhis ways were ways of pleasantness and all his paths were peace;\nMargat Burns was sure of it.",
        "Burns had a good deal of natural affection, but he was erratic;\nsometimes he would flog Guy mercilessly for nothing, and again laugh\nat some serious misdeed, so that the boy never knew just what to\nexpect, and kept on the safe side by avoiding his “Paw” as much as\npossible. His visits to the camp had been thoroughly disapproved,\npartly because it was on Old Man Raften’s land and partly because it\nenabled Guy to dodge the chores. Burns had been quite violent about it\nonce or twice, but Mrs. Burns had the great advantage of persistence,\nand like the steady strain of the skilful angler on the slender line,\nit wins in the end against the erratic violence of the strongest\ntrout. She had managed then that Guy should join the Injun camp, and\ngloried in his outrageously exaggerated accounts of how he could lick\nthem all at anything, “though they wuz so much older’n bigger’n he\nwuz.”",
        "But on this day he was fallen in hard luck. His father saw him coming,\nmet him with a “gad” and lashed him furiously. Knowing perfectly well\nthat the flogging would not stop till the proper effect was produced,\nand that was to be gauged by the racket, Guy yelled his loudest. This\nwas the uproar the boys had heard.",
        "“Now, ye idle young scut! I’ll larn ye to go round leaving bars down.\nYou go an’ tend to your work.” So instead of hiking back gloriously\nladen with Calfskins, Guy was sent to ignominious and un-Injun toil in\nthe garden.",
        "Soon he heard his mother: “Guysie, Guysie.” He dropped his hoe and\nwalked to the kitchen.",
        "“Where you goin’?” roared his father from afar. “Go back and mind your\nwork.”",
        "“Maw wants me. She called me.”",
        "“You mind your work. Don’t you dar’ on your life to go thayer.”",
        "But Guy took no notice and walked on to his mother. He knew that at\nthis post-thrashing stage of wrath his father was mouthy and harmless,\nand soon he was happy eating a huge piece of bread and jam.",
        "“Poor dear, you must be hungry, an’ your Paw was so mean to\nyou. There, now, don’t cry,” for Guy began to weep again at the\nrecollection of his wrongs. Then she whispered confidentially: “Paw’s\ngoing to Downey’s this afternoon, an’ you can slip away as soon as\nhe’s gone, an’ if you work well before that he won’t be so awful mad\nafter you come back. But be sure you don’t let down the bars, coz if\nthe pig was to get in Raften’s woods dear knows what.”",
        "This was the reason of Guy’s delay. He did not return to camp with the\nskins till late that day. As soon as he was gone, his foolish, doting\nmother, already crushed with the burden of the house, left everything\nand hoed two or three extra rows of cabbages, so “Paw” should find a\ngreat showing of work when he came back.",
        "The Calfskins were hard as tin and, of course, had the hair on.",
        "Caleb remarked, “It’ll take two or three days to get them right,” and\nburied them in a marshy, muddy pool in the full sunlight. “The warmer\nthe better.”",
        "Three days later he took them out. Instead of being thin, hard,\nyellow, semi-transparent, they now were much thicker, densely white,\nand soft as silk. The hair was easily scraped off and the two pieces\nwere pronounced all right for drumheads.",
        "Caleb washed them thoroughly in warm water, with soap to clear off\nthe grease, scraping them on both sides with a blunt knife; then he\nstraightened the outer edge of the largest, and cut a thin strip\nround and round it till he had some sixty feet of rawhide line, about\nthree-quarters of an inch wide. This he twisted, rolled and stretched\nuntil it was nearly round, then he cut from the remainder a circular\npiece thirty inches across, and a second from the “unchawed” part of\nthe other skin. He laid these one on the other, and with the sharp\npoint of a knife he made a row of holes in both, one inch from the\nedge and two inches apart. Then he set one skin on the ground, the\ndrum-log on that and the other skin on the top, and bound them\ntogether with the long lace, running it from hole No. 1 on the top\nto No. 2 on the bottom, then to No. 3 on the top, and No. 4 on the\nbottom, and so on twice around, till every hole had a lace through it\nand the crossing laces made a diamond pattern all around. At first\nthis was done loosely, but tightened up when once around, and\nfinally both the drum-heads were drawn tense. To the surprise of all,\nGuy promptly took possession of the finished drum. “Them’s my\nCalfskins,” which, of course, was true.",
        "And Caleb said, with a twinkle in his eye, “The wood seems to\ngo with the skins.”",
        "A drumstick of wood, with a piece of sacking lashed on to soften it,\nwas made, and Guy was disgusted to find how little sound the drum gave\nout.",
        "“’Bout like pounding a fur cap with a lamb’s tail,” Sam thought.",
        "“You hang that up in the shade to dry and you’ll find a change,” said\nthe Trapper.",
        "It was quite curious to note the effect of the drying as the hours\nwent by. The drum seemed to be wracking and straining itself in\nthe agony of effort, and slight noises came from it at times. When\nperfectly dry the semi-transparency of the rawhide came back, and the\nsound now was one to thrill the Red-man’s heart.",
        "Caleb taught them a little Indian war chant, and they danced round\nto it as he drummed and sang, till their savage instincts seemed to\nrevive. But above all it worked on Yan. As he pranced around in step\nhis whole nature seemed to respond; he felt himself a part of that\ndance. It was in himself; it thrilled him through and through and sent\nhis blood exulting. He would gladly have given up all the White-man’s\n“glorious gains” to live with the feeling called up by that Indian\ndrum.",
