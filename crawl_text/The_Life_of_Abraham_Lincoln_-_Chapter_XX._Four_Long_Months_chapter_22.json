        "Four months would not ordinarily be considered a long period of time.\nBut when one is compelled to see the working of a vast amount of\nmischief, powerless to prevent it, and knowing one’s self to be the\nchief victim of it all, the time is long. Such was the fate of Lincoln.\nThe election was not the end of a life of toil and struggle, it was the\nbeginning of a new career of sorrow. The period of four months between\nthe election and inauguration could not be devoted to rest or to the\npleasant plans for a prosperous term of service. There developed a plan\nfor the disruption of the government. The excuse was Lincoln’s\nelection. But he was for four months only a private citizen. He had no\npower. He could only watch the growing mischief and realize that he was\nthe ultimate victim. Buchanan, who was then President, had a genius for\ndoing the most unwise thing. He was a northern man with southern\nprinciples, and this may have unfitted him to see things in their true\nrelations. He certainly was putty in the hands of those who wished to\ndestroy the Union, and his vacillation precisely accomplished what they\nwished. Had he possessed the firmness and spirit of John A. Dix, who\nordered,–\"If any man attempts to haul down the American flag, shoot\nhim on the spot;” had he had a modicum of the patriotism of Andrew\nJackson; had he had a tithe of the wisdom and manliness of Lincoln;\nsecession would have been nipped in the bud and vast treasures of money\nand irreparable waste of human blood would have been spared. Whatever\nthe reason may have been,–incapacity, obliquity of moral and political\nvision, or absolute championship of the cause of disruption,–certain\nit is that the southern fire-eaters could not have found a tool more\nperfectly suited to their purpose than James Buchanan. He was the\ncenter of one of the most astonishing political cabals of all history.",
        "Lincoln did not pass indiscriminate condemnation upon all men of\nsouthern sympathies. At the time of which we are now writing, and\nconsistently up to the end of his life, he made a marked distinction\nbetween the rank and file of the Confederates on the one hand, and\nthose leaders who, on the other hand, had, while in the service of the\nUnited States government, sought to accomplish its destruction. The\nfirst were revolutionists; they were so regarded generally in Europe,\nand he believed they were sincere; he regarded them as having the\nspirit of revolutionists. For the second, who held office under, drew\npay from, and were under solemn oath to support, the government, while\nthey were using the vantage of their official position to violate the\nConstitution and disrupt that government, there is but one word, and\nthat a strong one,–traitors. This was Lincoln’s judgment of the men.",
        "Let us now briefly describe the situation. Jefferson Davis, though not\na member of Buchanan’s cabinet, was probably the most influential of\nthe Southerners in Washington. He had been Secretary of War under\nPierce, and it was he who inaugurated the policy of stripping the North\nfor the purpose of strengthening the military defenses of the South.\nThis policy was vigorously pursued under his successor.",
        "The only person to call a halt to the treasonable proceedings was\nGeneral Winfield Scott. He was residing in New York City, and on\nOctober 29th addressed a letter to President Buchanan containing his\nviews upon the situation. A day or two later he added supplementary\nconsiderations addressed to the Secretary of War. He set forth, with\nmuch clearness and force, the necessity of garrisoning the southern\nforts before they should be lost; His letter had its faults, but it\naccomplished one thing: it showed that there was one high official who\nwas in earnest in the discharge of his duties, and with whom it was not\nsafe to trifle.",
        "President Buchanan sent in his annual message to Congress December\n3, 1860. In his discussion of the subject of slavery, he recommended\nthat it be extended to the territories,–the very thing that the people\nhad just voted should not be done. Concerning secession, he said for\nsubstance that the government had the power to suppress revolt, but\nthat it could not use that power in reference to South Carolina, the\nstate then under consideration. The secessionists had apparently tied\nthe hands of the executive effectually.",
        "Now observe what was going on in the cabinet. Lewis Cass had been\nSecretary of State, but resigned in indignation over the inaction of\nthe President when he failed to succor the forts in Charleston Harbor.\nHe was succeeded by Jeremiah S. Black, who, as attorney-general, had\ngiven to Buchanan an opinion that the Federal government had no power\nto coerce a seceding state.",
        "Howell Cobb, Secretary of the Treasury, having wasted the funds and\ndestroyed the credit of the government, resigned and left an empty\ntreasury.",
        "John B. Floyd, Secretary of War, was not the least active. He carried\nout fully the plan which Jefferson Davis had begun to operate several\nyears before. The northern arsenals were stripped of the arms and\nammunition which were sent South for storage or use. The number of\nregular troops was small, but the few soldiers there were, he scattered\nin distant places, so that they should be out of reach. They were not\nto be available for the use of the government until the conspirators\nshould have time to complete their work. It was Floyd whom an emotional\nVirginian later eulogized. With quite as much truth as poetry he\ndeclared that the Secretary of War “thwarted, objected, resisted, and\nforbade” the efforts of General Scott. This same admirer of Floyd\nfurther declared that, if Scott’s plans had been adopted and his\nmeasures executed, the conspiracy would have been defeated and it would\nhave been impossible to form the Southern Confederacy.",
        "Not worse, perhaps, but more flagrant, was the action of the Secretary\nof the Interior, Thompson of Mississippi. With the advice and consent\nof Buchanan, he left his post at Washington to visit North Carolina and\nhelp on the work of secession, and then returned and resumed his\nofficial prerogatives under the government he had sworn to sustain.\nThis is so grave a matter that a passage from the diary of Mr. Clingman\nis here inserted, quoted by Nicolay and Hay: “About the middle of\nDecember (1860) I had occasion to see the Secretary of the Interior on\nsome official business. On my entering the room, Mr. Thompson said to\nme, ’Clingman, I am glad you have called, for I intended presently to\ngo up to the senate to see you. I have been appointed a commissioner by\nthe state of Mississippi to go down to North Carolina to get your state\nto secede.’ ... I said to him, ’I did not know you had resigned.’ He\nanswered, ’Oh, no! I have not resigned.’ ’Then,’ I replied, ’I suppose\nyou resign in the morning.’ ’No,’ he answered, ’I do not intend to\nresign, for Mr. Buchanan wished us all to hold on, and go out with him\non the 4th of March.’ ’But,’ said I, ’does Mr. Buchanan know for what\npurpose you are going to North Carolina?’ ’Certainly,’ he said, ’he\nknows my object.’” In the meanwhile, Isaac Toucey, the Secretary of the\nNavy, had been prevailed on to put the navy out of reach. The armed\nvessels were sent to the ends of the earth. At the critical period,\nonly two were available to the government. What was going on in\ncongress? That body was very busy doing nothing. Both senate and house\nraised committees for the purpose of devising means of compromise. But\nevery measure of concession was promptly voted down by the body that\nhad appointed the committees. In the senate the slave power was in full\ncontrol. In the house the slave power was not in majority, but they\nenjoyed this advantage that they were able to work together, while the\nconstituency of the free states were usually divided among themselves.\nAnd in joint session the extreme pro-slavery men were always able to\nprevent anything from being accomplished. This was all they wished.\nThey had sufficient pledges from the President that nothing would be\ndone before the 4th of March, and it was their belief that by that time\nthe new power would have so good a start that it could treat with the\nUnited States on equal terms. On January 7, 1861, Senator Yulee, of\nFlorida, wrote: “By remaining in our places until the 4th of March, it\nis thought we can keep the hands of Mr. Buchanan tied, and disable the\nrepublicans from effecting any legislation which will strengthen the\nhands of the incoming administration.”",
        "On December 14, thirty of the southern senators and representatives had\nissued a circular to their constituents. They said that the argument\nwas exhausted, that all hope of relief was extinguished, that the\nrepublicans would grant nothing satisfactory, and that the honor,\nsafety, and independence of the Southern people required the\norganization of a Southern Confederacy.",
        "South Carolina was the first to act. Six days later that state passed\nthe ordinance of secession.",
        "Upon this, one of the extreme traitors was forced out of the cabinet.\nFloyd, the mischievous Secretary of War, was displaced by Holt, a loyal\nman. Floyd, however, had done nearly, if not quite, all the mischief he\ncould have done. Stanton had already replaced Black as Attorney-General.",
        "The conspirators then held a caucus. It is supposed that this caucus\nwas held in one of the rooms of the Capitol. At all events it was held\nin the city of Washington. It was composed of the extreme southern\ncongressmen. It decided to recommend immediate secession, the formation\nof the Southern Confederacy, and, not least, that the congressmen\nshould remain in their seats to keep the President’s hands tied. The\ncommittee to carry out these plans consisted of Jefferson Davis,\nSlidell, and Mallory. By the first day of February, seven states had\npassed ordinances of secession.",
        "This is about what was going on during the four months Lincoln was\nwaiting for the appointed time when he should enter upon his duties. It\nwas not unlike looking upon a house he was shortly to occupy, and\nseeing vandals applying the torch and ax of destruction, while he was\nnot permitted to go to the rescue, all the while knowing that he would\nbe held accountable for the preservation of the structure. So Lincoln\nsaw this work of destruction going on at Washington. It was plain that\nthe mischief ought to be, and could be, stopped. But Buchanan would not\nstop it, and Lincoln was, until March 4th, a private citizen and could\ndo nothing. The bitterest part of it was that all the burden would fall\non him. As soon as he should become President it would be his duty to\nsave the government which these men were now openly destroying.",
        "Miss Tarbell has recorded a conversation between Lincoln and his friend\nJudge Gillespie, which took place in Springfield early in January, in\nwhich the former expressed his feelings upon the situation.\n“Gillespie,” said he, “I would willingly take out of my life a period\nin years equal to the two months which intervene between now and the\ninauguration, to take the oath of office now.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because every hour adds to the difficulties I am called upon to meet\nand the present administration does nothing to check the tendency\ntowards dissolution. I, who have been called to meet this awful\nresponsibility, am compelled to remain here, doing nothing to avert it\nor lessen its force when it comes to me.... Every day adds to the\nsituation and makes the outlook more gloomy. Secession is being\nfostered rather than repressed.... I have read, upon my knees, the\nstory of Gethsemane, where the Son of God prayed in vain that the cup\nof bitterness might pass from him. I am in the garden of Gethsemane\nnow, and my cup of bitterness is full to overflowing” (Tarbell, “Life\nof Lincoln,” II., 406).",
        "It was indeed hard to keep his patience and self-control. He was\nimportuned for expressions of his views, for messages conciliatory to\nthe South, for some kind of a proclamation which might quiet the public\nfeeling. But he saw clearly that anything he might say at that time, no\nmatter how wise or conciliatory, would surely be misused as fuel to add\nto the flames. While therefore he talked and wrote freely to his\nfriends, he made no public announcement. He merely referred to his\nrecord. His opinions had been fully expressed in the debates with\nDouglas and in other speeches. There were four important points as to\nhis future policy. The Union should be preserved, the Constitution\nshould be upheld, and the fugitive slave law (being a law) should be\nenforced, but slavery should not be extended. These fully covered all\nthe necessary points of the subject, and beyond these he would not go.\nHe who would control others must first control himself. It is hard to\nimagine a more severe test than this imposed on Lincoln during this\nperiod of waiting. He made his preparations in silence, and not an\ninjudicious word escaped him. He left his home for Washington the 11th\nday of February, but though he made several speeches on the way, he did\nnot outline his policy until he read his inaugural address on the 4th\nof March.",
