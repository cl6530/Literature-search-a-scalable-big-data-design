        "Mark Twain wrote much and well during this period, in spite of his social\nlife.  His article “Concerning the Jews” was written that first winter in\nVienna–a fine piece of special pleading; also the greatest of his short\nstories–one of the greatest of all short stories–\"The Man that\nCorrupted Hadleyburg.”",
        "But there were good reasons why he should write better now; his mind was\nfree of a mighty load–he had paid his debts!",
        "Soon after his arrival in Vienna he had written to Mr. Rogers:",
        "“Let us begin on those debts.  I cannot bear the weight any longer.\n     It totally unfits me for work.”",
        "He had accumulated a large sum for the purpose, and the royalties from\nthe new book were beginning to roll in.  Payment of the debts was begun.\nAt the end of December he wrote again:",
        "“Land, we are glad to see those debts diminishing.  For the first\n     time in my life I am getting more pleasure from paying money out\n     than from pulling it in.”",
        "A few days later he wrote to Howells that he had “turned the corner\"; and\nagain:",
        "“We’ve lived close to the bone and saved every cent we could, and\n     there’s no undisputed claim now that we can’t cash .  .  .  .  I\n     hope you will never get the like of the load saddled on to you that\n     was saddled on to me, three years ago.  And yet there is such a\n     solid pleasure in paying the things that I reckon it is worth while\n     to get into that kind of a hobble, after all.  Mrs. Clemens gets\n     millions of delight out of it, and the children have never uttered\n     one complaint about the scrimping from the beginning.”",
        "By the end of January, 1898, Clemens had accumulated enough money to make\nthe final payments to his creditors.  At the time of his failure he had\ngiven himself five years to achieve this result.  But he had needed less\nthan four.  A report from Mr. Rogers showed that a balance of thirteen\nthousand dollars would remain to his credit after the last accounts were\nwiped away.",
        "Clemens had tried to keep his money affairs out of the newspapers, but\nthe payment of the final claims could not be concealed, and the press\nmade the most of it.  Head-lines shouted it.  Editorials heralded Mark\nTwain as a second Walter Scott, because Scott, too, had labored to lift a\ngreat burden of debt.  Never had Mark Twain been so beloved by his\nfellow-men.",
        "One might suppose now that he had had enough of invention and commercial\nenterprises of every sort–that is, one who did not know Mark Twain might\nsuppose this–but it would not be true.  Within a month after his debts\nwere paid he was negotiating with the Austrian inventor Szczepanik for\nthe American rights in a wonderful carpet-pattern machine, and, Sellers-\nlike, was planning to organize a company with a capital of fifteen\nhundred million dollars to control the carpet-weaving industries of the\nworld.  He wrote to Mr. Rogers about the great scheme, inviting the\nStandard Oil to “come in\"; but the plan failed to bear the test of Mr.\nRogers’s investigation and was heard of no more.",
        "Samuel Clemens’s obligation to Henry Rogers was very great, but it was\nnot quite the obligation that many supposed it to be.  It was often\nasserted that the financier lent, even gave, the humorist large sums, and\npointed out opportunities for speculation.  No part of this statement is\ntrue.  Mr. Rogers neither lent nor gave Mark Twain money, and never\nallowed him to speculate when he could prevent it.  He sometimes invested\nMark Twain’s own funds for him, but he never bought for him a share of\nstock without money in hand to pay for it in full–money belonging to,\nand earned by, Clemens himself.",
        "What Henry Rogers did give to Mark Twain was his priceless counsel and\ntime–gifts more precious than any mere sum of money–favors that Mark\nTwain could accept without humiliation.  He did accept them, and never\nceased to be grateful.  He rarely wrote without expressing his gratitude,\nand we get the size of Mark Twain’s obligation when in one letter we\nread:",
        "“I have abundant peace of mind again–no sense of burden.  Work is\n     become a pleasure–it is not labor any longer.”",
        "He wrote much and well, mainly magazine articles, including some of those\nchapters later gathered it his book on “Christian Science.”  He reveled\nlike a boy in his new freedom and fortunes, in the lavish honors paid\nhim, in the rich circumstance of Viennese life.  But always just beneath\nthe surface were unforgetable sorrows.  His face in repose was always\nsad.  Once, after writing to Howells of his successes, he added:",
        "“All those things might move and interest one.  But how desperately\n     more I have been moved to-night by the thought of a little old copy\n     in the nursery of “At the Back of the North Wind.”  Oh, what happy\n     days they were when that book was read, and how Susy loved it!”",
