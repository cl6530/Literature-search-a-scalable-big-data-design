        "Heidi was standing under the waving fir trees waiting for her\ngrandfather, who was going down with her to grandmother’s, and\nthen on to Dorfli to fetch her box. She was longing to know how\ngrandmother had enjoyed her white bread and impatient to see and\nhear her again; but no time seemed weary to her now, for she\ncould not listen long enough to the familiar voice of the trees,\nor drink in too much of the fragrance wafted to her from the\ngreen pastures where the golden-headed flowers were glowing in\nthe sun, a very feast to her eyes. The grandfather came out,\ngave a look round, and then called to her in a cheerful voice,\n“Well, now we can be off.”",
        "It was Saturday, a day when Alm-Uncle made everything clean and\ntidy inside and outside the house; he had devoted his morning to\nthis work so as to be able to accompany Heidi in the afternoon,\nand the whole place was now as spick and span as he liked to see\nit. They parted at the grandmother’s cottage and Heidi ran in.\nThe grandmother had heard her steps approaching and greeted her\nas she crossed the threshold, “Is it you, child? Have you come\nagain?”",
        "Then she took hold of Heidi’s hand and held it fast in her own,\nfor she still seemed to fear that the child might be torn from\nher again. And now she had to tell Heidi how much she had\nenjoyed the white bread, and how much stronger she felt already\nfor having been able to eat it, and then Peter’s mother went on\nand said she was sure that if her mother could eat like that for\na week she would get back some of her strength, but she was so\nafraid of coming to the end of the rolls, that she had only\neaten one as yet. Heidi listened to all Brigitta said, and sat\nthinking for a while. Then she suddenly thought of a way.",
        "“I know, grandmother, what I will do,” she said eagerly, “I will\nwrite to Clara, and she will send me as many rolls again, if not\ntwice as many as you have already, for I had ever such a large\nheap in the wardrobe, and when they were all taken away she\npromised to give me as many back, and she would do so I am\nsure.”",
        "“That is a good idea,” said Brigitta; “but then, they would get\nhard and stale. The baker in Dorfli makes the white rolls, and\nif we could get some of those he has over now and then–but I can\nonly just manage to pay for the black bread.”",
        "A further bright thought came to Heidi, and with a look of joy,\n“Oh, I have lots of money, grandmother,” she cried gleefully,\nskipping about the room in her delight, “and I know now what I\nwill do with it. You must have a fresh white roll every day, and\ntwo on Sunday, and Peter can bring them up from Dorfli.”",
        "“No, no, child!” answered the grandmother, “I cannot let you do\nthat; the money was not given to you for that purpose; you must\ngive it to your grandfather, and he will tell you how you are to\nspend it.”",
        "But Heidi was not to be hindered in her kind intentions, and she\ncontinued to jump about, saying over and over again in a tone of\nexultation, “Now, grandmother can have a roll every day and will\ngrow quite strong again–and, Oh, grandmother,” she suddenly\nexclaimed with an increase of jubilation in her voice, “if you\nget strong everything will grow light again for you; perhaps\nit’s only because you are weak that it is dark.” The grandmother\nsaid nothing, she did not wish to spoil the child’s pleasure. As\nshe went jumping about Heidi suddenly caught sight of the\ngrandmother’s song book, and another happy idea struck her,\n“Grandmother, I can also read now, would you like me to read you\none of your hymns from your old book?”",
        "“Oh, yes,” said the grandmother, surprised and delighted; “but\ncan you really read, child, really?”",
        "Heidi had climbed on to a chair and had already lifted down the\nbook, bringing a cloud of dust with it, for it had lain\nuntouched on the shelf for a long time. Heidi wiped it, sat\nherself down on a stool beside the old woman, and asked her which\nhymn she should read.",
        "“What you like, child, what you like,” and the grandmother\npushed her spinning-wheel aside and sat in eager expectation\nwaiting for Heidi to begin. Heidi turned over the leaves and read\na line out softly to herself here and there. At last she said,",
        "“Here is one about the sun, grandmother, I will read you that.\"\nAnd Heidi began, reading with more and more warmth of expression\nas she went on,–",
        "     The morning breaks,\n      And warm and bright\n      The earth lies still\n      In the golden light–\n  For Dawn has scattered the clouds of night.",
        "     God’s handiwork\n      Is seen around,\n      Things great and small\n      To His praise abound–\n  Where are the signs of His love not found?",
        "     All things must pass,\n      But God shall still\n      With steadfast power\n      His will fulfil–\n  Sure and unshaken is His will.",
        "     His saving grace\n      Will never fail,\n      Though grief and fear\n      The heart assail–\n  O’er life’s wild seas He will prevail.",
        "     Joy shall be ours\n      In that garden blest,\n      Where after storm\n      We find our rest–\n  I wait in peace–God’s time is best.",
        "The grandmother sat with folded hands and a look of indescribable\njoy on her face, such as Heidi had never seen there before,\nalthough at the same time the tears were running down her cheeks.\nAs Heidi finished, she implored her, saying, “Read it once again,\nchild, just once again.”",
        "And the child began again, with as much pleasure in the verses\nas the grandmother,–",
        "     Joy shall be ours\n      In that garden blest,\n      Where after storm\n      We find our rest–\n  I wait in peace–God’s time is best.",
        "“Ah, Heidi, that brings light to the heart! What comfort you\nhave brought me!”",
        "And the old woman kept on repeating the glad words, while Heidi\nbeamed with happiness, and she could not take her eyes away from\nthe grandmother’s face, which had never looked like that before.\nIt had no longer the old troubled expression, but was alight\nwith peace and joy as if she were already looking with clear new\neyes into the garden or Paradise.",
        "Some one now knocked at the window and Heidi looked up and saw\nher grandfather beckoning her to come home with him. She\npromised the grandmother before leaving her that she would be\nwith her the next day, and even if she went out with Peter she\nwould only spend half the day with him, for the thought that she\nmight make it light and happy again for the grandmother gave her\nthe greatest pleasure, greater even than being out on the sunny\nmountain with the flowers and goats. As she was going out\nBrigitta ran to her with the frock and hat she had left. Heidi\nput the dress over her arm, for, as she thought to herself, the\ngrandfather had seen that before, but she obstinately refused to\ntake back the hat; Brigitta could keep it, for she should never\nput it on her head again. Heidi was so full of her morning’s\ndoings that she began at once to tell her grandfather all about\nthem: how the white bread could be fetched every day from Dorfli\nif there was money for it, and how the grandmother had all at\nonce grown stronger and happier, and light had come to her. Then\nshe returned to the subject of the rolls. “If the grandmother\nwon’t take the money, grandfather, will you give it all to me,\nand I can then give Peter enough every day to buy a roll and two\non Sunday?”",
        "“But how about the bed?” said her grandfather. “It would be nice\nfor you to have a proper bed, and there would then be plenty for\nthe bread.”",
        "But Heidi gave her grandfather no peace till he consented to do\nwhat she wanted; she slept a great deal better, she said, on her\nbed of hay than on her fine pillowed bed in Frankfurt. So at\nlast he said, “The money is yours, do what you like with it; you\ncan buy bread for grandmother for years to come with it.”",
        "Heidi shouted for joy at the thought that grandmother would\nnever need any more to eat hard black bread, and “Oh,\ngrandfather!” she said, “everything is happier now than it has\never been in our lives before!” and she sang and skipped along,\nholding her grandfather’s hand as light-hearted as a bird. But\nall at once she grew quiet and said, “If God had let me come at\nonce, as I prayed, then everything would have been different, I\nshould only have had a little bread to bring to grandmother, and\nI should not have been able to read, which is such a comfort to\nher; but God has arranged it all so much better than I knew how\nto; everything has happened just as the other grandmother said it\nwould. Oh, how glad I am that God did not let me have at once all\nI prayed and wept for! And now I shall always pray to God as she\ntold me, and always thank Him, and when He does not do anything I\nask for I shall think to myself, It’s just like it was in\nFrankfurt: God, I am sure, is going to do something better still.\nSo we will pray every day, won’t we, grandfather, and never\nforget Him again, or else He may forget us.”",
        "“And supposing one does forget Him?” said the grandfather in a\nlow voice.",
        "“Then everything goes wrong, for God lets us then go where we\nlike, and when we get poor and miserable and begin to cry about\nit no one pities us, but they say, You ran away from God, and so\nGod, who could have helped you, left you to yourself.”",
        "“That is true, Heidi; where did you learn that?”",
        "“From grandmamma; she explained it all to me.”",
        "The grandfather walked on for a little while without speaking,\nthen he said, as if following his own train of thought: “And if\nit once is so, it is so always; no one can go back, and he whom\nGod has forgotten, is forgotten for ever.”",
        "“Oh, no, grandfather, we can go back, for grandmamma told me so,\nand so it was in the beautiful tale in my book–but you have not\nheard that yet; but we shall be home directly now, and then I\nwill read it you, and you will see how beautiful it is.” And in\nher eagerness Heidi struggled faster and faster up the steep\nascent, and they were no sooner at the top than she let go her\ngrandfather’s hand and ran into the hut. The grandfather slung\nthe basket off his shoulders in which he had brought up a part\nof the contents of the trunk which was too heavy to carry up as\nit was. Then he sat down on his seat and began thinking.",
        "Heidi soon came running out with her book under her arm. “That’s\nright, grandfather,” she exclaimed as she saw he had already\ntaken his seat, and in a second she was beside him and had her\nbook open at the particular tale, for she had read it so often\nthat the leaves fell open at it of their own accord. And now in\na sympathetic voice Heidi began to read of the son when he was\nhappily at home, and went out into the fields with his father’s\nflocks, and was dressed in a fine cloak, and stood leaning on\nhis shepherd’s staff watching as the sun went down, just as he\nwas to be seen in the picture. But then all at once he wanted to\nhave his own goods and money and to be his own master, and so he\nasked his father to give him his portion, and he left his home\nand went and wasted all his substance. And when he had nothing\nleft he hired himself out to a master who had no flocks and\nfields like his father, but only swine to keep; and so he was\nobliged to watch these, and he only had rags to wear and a few\nhusks to eat such as the swine fed upon. And then he thought of\nhis old happy life at home and of how kindly his father had\ntreated him and how ungrateful he had been, and he wept for\nsorrow and longing. And he thought to himself, “I will arise and\ngo to my father, and will say to him, ’Father, I am not worthy to\nbe called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants.’” And\nwhen he was yet a great way off his father saw him . . . Here\nHeidi paused in her reading. “What do you think happens now,\ngrandfather?” she said. “Do you think the father is still angry\nand will say to him, ’I told you so!’ Well, listen now to what\ncomes next.” His father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and\nfell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said to him,\n“Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight, and am no\nmore worthy to be called thy son.” But the father said to his\nservants, “Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put\na ring on his hand and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the\nfatted calf and kill it; and let us eat and be merry, for this my\nson was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.” And\nthey began to be merry.",
        "“Isn’t that a beautiful tale, grandfather,” said Heidi, as the\nlatter continued to sit without speaking, for she had expected\nhim to express pleasure and astonishment.",
        "“You are right, Heidi; it is a beautiful tale,” he replied, but\nhe looked so grave as he said it that Heidi grew silent herself\nand sat looking quietly at her pictures. Presently she pushed\nher book gently in front of him and said, “See how happy he is\nthere,” and she pointed with her finger to the figure of the\nreturned prodigal, who was standing by his father clad in fresh\nraiment as one of his own sons again.",
        "A few hours later, as Heidi lay fast asleep in her bed, the\ngrandfather went up the ladder and put his lamp down near her\nbed so that the light fell on the sleeping child. Her hands were\nstill folded as if she had fallen asleep saying her prayers, an\nexpression of peace and trust lay on the little face, and\nsomething in it seemed to appeal to the grandfather, for he\nstood a long time gazing down at her without speaking. At last he\ntoo folded his hands, and with bowed head said in a low voice,\n“Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee and am not\nworthy to be called thy son.” And two large tears rolled down\nthe old man’s cheeks.",
        "Early the next morning he stood in front of his hut and gazed\nquietly around him. The fresh bright morning sun lay on mountain\nand valley. The sound of a few early bells rang up from the\nvalley, and the birds were singing their morning song in the fir\ntrees. He stepped back into the hut and called up, “Come along,\nHeidi! the sun is up! Put on your best frock, for we are going\nto church together!”",
        "Heidi was not long getting ready; it was such an unusual summons\nfrom her grandfather that she must make haste. She put on her\nsmart Frankfurt dress and soon went down, but when she saw her\ngrandfather she stood still, gazing at him in astonishment.\n“Why, grandfather!” she exclaimed, “I never saw you look like\nthat before! and the coat with the silver buttons! Oh, you do\nlook nice in your Sunday coat!”",
        "The old man smiled and replied, “And you too; now come along!\"\nHe took Heidi’s hand in his and together they walked down the\nmountain side. The bells were ringing in every direction now,\nsounding louder and fuller as they neared the valley, and Heidi\nlistened to them with delight. “Hark at them, grandfather! it’s\nlike a great festival!”",
        "The congregation had already assembled and the singing had begun\nwhen Heidi and her grandfather entered the church at Dorfli and\nsat down at the back. But before the hymn was over every one was\nnudging his neighbor and whispering, “Do you see? Alm-Uncle is\nin church!”",
        "Soon everybody in the church knew of Alm-Uncle’s presence, and\nthe women kept on turning round to look and quite lost their\nplace in the singing. But everybody became more attentive when\nthe sermon began, for the preacher spoke with such warmth and\nthankfulness that those present felt the effect of his words, as\nif some great joy had come to them all. At the close of the\nservice Alm-Uncle took Heidi by the hand, and on leaving the\nchurch made his way towards the pastor’s house; the rest of the\ncongregation looked curiously after him, some even following to\nsee whether he went inside the pastor’s house, which he did.\nThen they collected in groups and talked over this strange event,\nkeeping their eyes on the pastor’s door, watching to see whether\nAlm-Uncle came out looking angry and quarrelsome, or as if the\ninterview had been a peaceful one, for they could not imagine\nwhat had brought the old man down, and what it all meant. Some,\nhowever, adopted a new tone and expressed their opinion that Alm-\nUncle was not so bad after all as they thought, “for see how\ncarefully he took the little one by the hand.” And others\nresponded and said they had always thought people had\nexaggerated about him, that if he was so downright bad he would\nbe afraid to go inside the pastor’s house. Then the miller put in\nhis word, “Did I not tell you so from the first? What child is\nthere who would run away from where she had plenty to eat and\ndrink and everything of the best, home to a grandfather who was\ncruel and unkind, and of whom she was afraid?”",
        "And so everybody began to feel quite friendly towards Alm-Uncle,\nand the women now came up and related all they had been told by\nPeter and his grandmother, and finally they all stood there like\npeople waiting for an old friend whom they had long missed from\namong their number.",
        "Meanwhile Alm-Uncle had gone into the pastor’s house and knocked\nat the study door. The latter came out and greeted him, not as\nif he was surprised to see him, but as if he had quite expected\nto see him there; he probably had caught sight of the old man in\nchurch. He shook hands warmly with him, and Alm-Uncle was unable\nat first to speak, for he had not expected such a friendly\nreception. At last he collected himself and said, “I have come\nto ask you, pastor, to forget the words I spoke to you when you\ncalled on me, and to beg you not to owe me ill-will for having\nbeen so obstinately set against your well-meant advice. You were\nright, and I was wrong, but I have now made up my mind to follow\nyour advice and to find a place for myself at Dorfli for the\nwinter, for the child is not strong enough to stand the bitter\ncold up on the mountain. And if the people down here look\naskance at me, as at a person not to be trusted, I know it is my\nown fault, and you will, I am sure, not do so.”",
        "The pastor’s kindly eyes shone with pleasure. He pressed the old\nman’s hand in his, and said with emotion, “Neighbor, you went\ninto the right church before you came to mine; I am greatly\nrejoiced. You will not repent coming to live with us again; as\nfor myself you will always be welcome as a dear friend and\nneighbor, and I look forward to our spending many a pleasant\nwinter evening together, for I shall prize your companionship,\nand we will find some nice friends too for the little one.” And\nthe pastor laid his hand kindly on the child’s curly head and\ntook her by the hand as he walked to the door with the old man.\nHe did not say good-bye to him till they were standing outside,\nso that all the people standing about saw him shake hands as if\nparting reluctantly from his best friend. The door had hardly\nshut behind him before the whole congregation now came forward\nto greet Alm-Uncle, every one striving to be the first to shake\nhands with him, and so many were held out that Alm-Uncle did not\nknow with which to begin; and some said, “We are so pleased to\nsee you among us again,” and another, “I have long been wishing\nwe could have a talk together again,” and greetings of all kinds\nechoed from every side, and when Alm-Uncle told them he was\nthinking of returning to his old quarters in Dorfli for the\nwinter, there was such a general chorus of pleasure that any one\nwould have thought he was the most beloved person in all Dorfli,\nand that they had hardly known how to live without him. Most of\nhis friends accompanied him and Heidi some way up the mountain,\nand each as they bid him good-bye made him promise that when he\nnext came down he would without fail come and call. As the old\nman at last stood alone with the child, watching their\nretreating figures, there was a light upon his face as if\nreflected from some inner sunshine of heart. Heidi, looking up at\nhim with her clear steady eyes, said, “Grandfather, you look\nnicer and nicer to-day, I never saw you quite like that before.”",
        "“Do you think so?” he answered with a smile. “Well, yes, Heidi,\nI am happier to-day than I deserve, happier than I had thought\npossible; it is good to be at peace with God and man! God was\ngood to me when He sent you to my hut.”",
        "When they reached Peter’s home the grandfather opened the door\nand walked straight in. “Good-morning, grandmother,” he said. “I\nthink we shall have to do some more patching, up before the\nautumn winds come.”",
        "“Dear God, if it is not Uncle!” cried the grandmother in pleased\nsurprise. “That I should live to see such a thing! and now I can\nthank you for all that you have done for me. May God reward you!\nmay God reward you!” She stretched out a trembling hand to him,\nand when the grandfather shook it warmly, she went on, still\nholding his, “And I have something on my heart I want to say, a\nprayer to make to you! If I have injured you in any way, do not\npunish me by sending the child away again before I lie under the\ngrass. Oh, you do not know what that child is to me!” and she\nclasped the child to her, for Heidi had already taken her usual\nstand close to the grandmother.",
        "“Have no fear, grandmother,” said Uncle in a reassuring voice,\n“I shall not punish either you or myself by doing so. We are all\ntogether now, and pray God we may continue so for long.”",
        "Brigitta now drew the Uncle aside towards a corner of the room\nand showed him the hat with the feathers, explaining to him how\nit came there, and adding that of course she could not take such\na thing from a child.",
        "But the grandfather looked towards Heidi without any displeasure\nof countenance and said, “The hat is hers, and if she does not\nwish to wear it any more she has a right to say so and to give\nit to you, so take it, pray.”",
        "Brigitta was highly delighted at this. “It is well worth more\nthan ten shillings!” she said as she held it up for further\nadmiration. “And what a blessing Heidi has brought home with her\nfrom Frankfurt! I have thought sometimes that it might be good\nto send Peter there for a little while; what do you think,\nUncle?”",
        "A merry look came into the grandfather’s eye. He thought it\nwould do Peter no harm, but he had better wait for a good\nopportunity before starting. At this moment the subject of their\nconversation himself rushed in, evidently in a great hurry,\nknocking his head violently against the door in his haste, so\nthat everything in the room rattled. Gasping and breathless he\nstood still after this and held out a letter. This was another\ngreat event, for such a thing had never happened before; the\nletter was addressed to Heidi and had been delivered at the post-\noffice in Dorfli. They all sat down round the table to hear what\nwas in it, for Heidi opened it at once and read it without\nhesitation. The letter was from Clara. The latter wrote that the\nhouse had been so dull since Heidi left that she did not know how\nto bear herself, and she had at last persuaded her father to take\nher to the baths at Ragatz in the coming autumn; grandmamma had\narranged to join them there, and they both were looking forward\nto paying her and her grandfather a visit. And grandmamma sent a\nfurther message to Heidi which was that the latter had done quite\nright to take the rolls to the grandmother, and so that she might\nnot have to eat them dry, she was sending some coffee, which was\nalready on its way, and grandmamma hoped when she came to the\nAlm in the autumn that Heidi would take her to see her old\nfriend.",
        "There were exclamations of pleasure and astonishment on hearing\nall this news, and so much to talk and ask about that even the\ngrandfather did not notice how the time was passing; there was\ngeneral delight at the thought of the coming days, and even more\nat the meeting which had taken place on this one, and the\ngrandmother spoke and said, “The happiest of all things is when\nan old friend comes and greets us as in former times; the heart\nis comforted with the assurance that some day everything that we\nhave loved will be given back to us.–You will come soon again,\nuncle, and you child, to-morrow?”",
        "The old man and Heidi promised her faithfully to do so; then it\nwas time to break up the party, and these two went back up the\nmountain. As they had been greeted with bells when they made\ntheir journey down in the morning, so now they were accompanied\nby the peaceful evening chimes as they climbed to the hut, which\nhad quite a Sunday-like appearance as it stood bathed in the\nlight of the low evening sun.",
        "But when grandmamma comes next autumn there will be many fresh\njoys and surprises both for Heidi and grandmother; without doubt\na proper bed will be put up in the hay-loft, for wherever\ngrandmamma steps in, there everything is soon in right order,\noutside and in.",
