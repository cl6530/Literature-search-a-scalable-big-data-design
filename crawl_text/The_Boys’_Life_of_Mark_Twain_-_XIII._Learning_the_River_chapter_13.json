        "In that early day, to be a pilot was to be “greater than a king.”  The\nMississippi River pilot was a law unto himself–there was none above him.\nHis direction of the boat was absolute; he could start or lay up when he\nchose; he could pass a landing regardless of business there, consulting\nnobody, not even the captain; he could take the boat into what seemed\ncertain destruction, if he had that mind, and the captain was obliged to\nstand by, helpless and silent, for the law was with the pilot in\neverything.",
        "Furthermore, the pilot was a gentleman.  His work was clean and\nphysically light.  It ended the instant the boat was tied to the landing,\nand did not begin again until it was ready to back into the stream.\nAlso, for those days his salary was princely–the Vice-President of the\nUnited States did not receive more.  As for prestige, the Mississippi\npilot, perched high in his glass inclosure, fashionably dressed, and\ncommanding all below him, was the most conspicuous and showy, the most\nobserved and envied creature in the world.  No wonder Sam Clemens, with\nhis love of the river and his boyish fondness for honors, should aspire\nto that stately rank.  Even at twenty-one he was still just a boy–as,\nindeed, he was till his death–and we may imagine how elated he was,\nstarting up the great river as a real apprentice pilot, who in a year or\ntwo would stand at the wheel, as his chief was now standing, a monarch\nwith a splendid income and all the great river packed away in his head.",
        "In that last item lay the trouble.  In the Mississippi book he tells of\nit in a way that no one may hope to equal, and if the details are not\nexact, the truth is there–at least in substance.",
        "For a distance above New Orleans Mr. Bixby had volunteered information\nabout the river, naming the points and crossings, in what seemed a casual\nway, all through his watch of four hours.  Their next watch began in the\nmiddle of the night, and Mark Twain tells how surprised and disgusted he\nwas to learn that pilots must get up in the night to run their boats, and\nhis amazement to find Mr. Bixby plunging into the blackness ahead as if\nit had been daylight.  Very likely this is mainly fiction, but hardly the\nfollowing:",
        "     Presently he turned to me and said: “What’s the name of the first\n     point above New Orleans?”",
        "     I was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did.  I said I\n     didn’t know.",
        "     “Don’t know!”",
        "     His manner jolted me.  I was down at the foot again, in a moment.\n     But I had to say just what I had said before.",
        "     “Well, you’re a smart one,” said Mr. Bixby.  “What’s the name of the\n     next point?”",
        "     Once more I didn’t know.",
        "     “Well, this beats anything!  Tell me the name of any point or place\n     I told you.”",
        "     I studied awhile and decided that I couldn’t.",
        "     “Look here!  What do you start from, above Twelve Mile Point, to\n     cross over?”",
        "     “I–I–don’t know.”",
        "     “’You–you don’t know,\"’ mimicking my drawling manner of speech.\n     “What do you know?”",
        "     “I–I–Nothing, for certain.”",
        "     Bixby was a small, nervous man, hot and quick-firing.  He went off\n     now, and said a number of severe things.  Then:",
        "     “Look here, what do you suppose I told you the names of those points\n     for?”",
        "     I tremblingly considered a moment–then the devil of temptation\n     provoked me to say: “Well–to–to–be entertaining, I thought.”",
        "     This was a red flag to the bull.  He raged and stormed so (he was\n     crossing the river at the time) that I judged it made him blind,\n     because he ran over the steering-oar of a trading-scow.  Of course\n     the traders sent up a volley of red-hot profanity.  Never was a man\n     so grateful as Mr. Bixby was, because he was brimful, and here were\n     subjects who would talk back.  He threw open a window, thrust his\n     head out, and such an irruption followed as I had never heard before\n     .  .  .  . When he closed the window he was empty.  Presently he\n     said to me, in the gentlest way:",
        "     “My boy, you must get a little memorandum-book, and every time I\n     tell you a thing, put it down right away.  There’s only one way to\n     be a pilot, and that is to get this entire river by heart.  You have\n     to know it just like A-B-C.”",
        "The little memorandum-book which Sam Clemens bought, probably at the next\ndaylight landing, still exists–the same that he says “fairly bristled\nwith the names of towns, points, bars, islands, bends, reaches, etc.\";\nbut it made his heart ache to think he had only half the river set down,\nfor, as the watches were four hours off and four hours on, there were the\nlong gaps where he had slept.",
        "It is not easy to make out the penciled notes today.  The small, neat\nwriting is faded, and many of them are in an abbreviation made only for\nhimself.  It is hard even to find these examples to quote:",
        "One-fourth less 3[3]–run shape of upper bar and go into the low place in\nthe willows about 200 (ft.) lower down than last year.",
        "Six or eight feet more water.  Shape bar till high timber on towhead gets\nnearly even with low willows.  Then hold a little open on right of low\nwillows–run ’em close if you want to, but come out 200 yards when you\nget nearly to head of towhead.",
        "The average mind would not hold a single one of these notes ten seconds,\nyet by the time he reached St. Louis he had set down pages that to-day\nmake one’s head weary even to contemplate.  And those long four-hour gaps\nwhere he had been asleep–they are still there; and now, after nearly\nsixty years, the old heartache is still in them.  He must have bought a\nnew book for the next trip and laid this one away.",
        "To the new “cub” it seemed a long way to St. Louis that first trip, but\nin the end it was rather grand to come steaming up to the big, busy city,\nwith its thronging waterfront flanked with a solid mile of steamboats,\nand to nose one’s way to a place in that stately line.",
        "At St. Louis, Sam borrowed from his brother-in-law the one hundred\ndollars he had agreed to pay, and so closed his contract with Bixby.  A\nfew days later his chief was engaged to go on a very grand boat indeed–a\n“sumptuous temple,” he tells us, all brass and inlay, with a pilot-house\nso far above the water that he seemed perched on a mountain.  This part\nof learning the river was worth while; and when he found that the\nregiment of natty servants respectfully “sir’d” him, his happiness was\ncomplete.",
        "But he was in the depths again, presently, for when they started down the\nriver and he began to take account of his knowledge, he found that he had\nnone.  Everything had changed–that is, he was seeing it all from the\nother direction.  What with the four-hour gaps and this transformation,\nhe was lost completely.",
        "How could the easy-going, dreamy, unpractical man whom the world knew as\nMark Twain ever have persisted against discouragement like that to\nacquire the vast, the absolute, limitless store of information necessary\nto Mississippi piloting?  The answer is that he loved the river, the\npicturesqueness and poetry of a steamboat, the ease and glory of a\npilot’s life; and then, in spite of his own later claims to the contrary,\nSamuel Clemens, boy and man, in the work suited to his tastes and gifts,\nwas the most industrious of persons.  Work of the other sort he avoided,\noverlooked, refused to recognize, but never any labor for which he was\nqualified by his talents or training.  Piloting suited him exactly, and\nhe proved an apt pupil.",
        "Horace Bixby said to the writer of this memoir: “Sam was always good-\nnatured, and he had a natural taste for the river.  He had a fine memory\nand never forgot what I told him.”",
        "Yet there must have been hard places all along, for to learn every crook\nand turn and stump and snag and bluff and bar and sounding of that twelve\nhundred miles of mighty, shifting water was a gigantic task.  Mark Twain\ntells us how, when he was getting along pretty well, his chief one day\nturned on him suddenly with this “settler”:",
        "     “What is the shape of Walnut Bend?”",
        "     He might as well have asked me my grandmother’s opinion of\n     protoplasm.  I replied respectfully and said I didn’t know it had\n     any particular shape.  My gun-powdery chief went off with a bang, of\n     course, and then went on loading and firing until he was out of\n     adjectives ....I waited.  By and by he said:",
        "     “My boy, you’ve got to know the shape of the river perfectly.  It is\n     all that is left to steer by on a very dark night.  Everything else\n     is blotted out and gone.  But mind you, it hasn’t got the same shape\n     in the night that it has in the daytime.”",
        "     “How on earth am I going to learn it, then?”",
        "     “How do you follow a hall at home in the dark?  Because you know the\n     shape of it.  You can’t see it.”",
        "     “Do you mean to say that I’ve got to know all the million trifling\n     variations of shape in the banks of this interminable river as well\n     as I know the shape of the front hall at home?”",
        "     “On my honor, you’ve got to know them better than any man ever did\n     know the shapes of the halls in his own house.”",
        "     “I wish I was dead!”",
        "But the reader must turn to Chapter VIII of “Life on the Mississippi” and\nread, or reread, the pages which follow this extract–nothing can better\nconvey the difficulties of piloting.  That Samuel Clemens had the courage\nto continue is the best proof, not only of his great love of the river,\nbut of that splendid gift of resolution that one rarely fails to find in\nmen of the foremost rank.",
