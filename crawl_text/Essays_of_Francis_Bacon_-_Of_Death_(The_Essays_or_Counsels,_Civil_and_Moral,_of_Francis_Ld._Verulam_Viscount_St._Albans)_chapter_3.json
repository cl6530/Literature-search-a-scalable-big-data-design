        "MEN fear death, as children fear to go in the\ndark; and as that natural fear in children,\nis increased with tales, so is the other.  Certainly,\nthe contemplation of death, as the wages of sin,\nand passage to another world, is holy and religious; but the fear of it, as a tribute due unto nature,\nis weak.  Yet in religious meditations, there is sometimes mixture of vanity, and of superstition.  You\nshall read, in some of the friars’ books of mortification, that a man should think with himself, what\nthe pain is, if he have but his finger’s end pressed,\nor tortured, and thereby imagine, what the pains\nof death are, when the whole body is corrupted,\nand dissolved; when many times death passeth,\nwith less pain than the torture of a limb; for the\nmost vital parts, are not the quickest of sense.  And\nby him that spake only as a philosopher, and natural man, it was well said, Pompa mortis magis\nterret, quam mors ipsa.  Groans, and convulsions,\nand a discolored face, and friends weeping, and\nblacks, and obsequies, and the like, show death\nterrible.  It is worthy the observing, that there is no\npassion in the mind of man, so weak, but it mates,\nand masters, the fear of death; and therefore,\ndeath is no such terrible enemy, when a man hath\nso many attendants about him, that can win the\ncombat of him.  Revenge triumphs over death; love\nslights it; honor aspireth to it; grief flieth to it; fear\npreoccupateth it; nay, we read, after Otho the emperor had slain himself, pity (which is the tenderest of affections) provoked many to die, out of mere\ncompassion to their sovereign, and as the truest\nsort of followers.  Nay, Seneca adds niceness and\nsatiety: Cogita quamdiu eadem feceris; mori velle,\nnon tantum fortis aut miser, sed etiam fastidiosus\npotest.  A man would die, though he were neither\nvaliant, nor miserable, only upon a weariness to\ndo the same thing so oft, over and over.  It is no less\nworthy, to observe, how little alteration in good\nspirits, the approaches of death make; for they\nappear to be the same men, till the last instant.\nAugustus Caesar died in a compliment; Livia, conjugii nostri memor, vive et vale.  Tiberius in dissimulation; as Tacitus saith of him, Jam Tiberium\nvires et corpus, non dissimulatio, deserebant.  Vespasian in a jest, sitting upon the stool; Ut puto deus\nfio.  Galba with a sentence; Feri, si ex re sit populi\nRomani; holding forth his neck.  Septimius Severus\nin despatch; Adeste si quid mihi restat agendum.\nAnd the like.  Certainly the Stoics bestowed too\nmuch cost upon death, and by their great preparations, made it appear more fearful.  Better saith he,\nqui finem vitae extremum inter munera ponat\nnaturae.  It is as natural to die, as to be born; and to\na little infant, perhaps, the one is as painful, as the\nother.  He that dies in an earnest pursuit, is like one\nthat is wounded in hot blood; who, for the time,\nscarce feels the hurt; and therefore a mind fixed,\nand bent upon somewhat that is good, doth avert\nthe dolors of death.  But, above all, believe it, the\nsweetest canticle is’, Nunc dimittis; when a man\nhath obtained worthy ends, and expectations.\nDeath hath this also; that it openeth the gate to\ngood fame, and extinguisheth envy. - Extinctus\namabitur idem.",
