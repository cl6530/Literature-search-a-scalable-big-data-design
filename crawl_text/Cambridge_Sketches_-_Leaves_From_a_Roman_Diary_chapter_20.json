        "(Rewritten in 1897)",
        "As I look out of P——’s windows on the Via Frattina every morning at\nthe plaster bust of Pius IX., I like his face more and more, and feel\nthat he is not an unworthy companion to George Washington and the young\nAugustus. [Footnote: Three busts in a row.] I think there may be\nsomething of the fox, or rather of the crow, in his composition,\nbut his face has the wholeness of expression which shows a sound and\nhealthy mind,—not a patchwork character. I was pleased to hear that he\nwas originally a liberal; and the first, after the long conservative\nreaction of Metternich, to introduce reforms in the states of the Church.\nThe Revolution of 1848 followed too quickly, and the extravagant\nproceedings of Mazzini and Garibaldi drove him into the ranks of the\nconservatives, where he has remained ever since. Carlyle compared him to\na man who had an old tin-kettle which he thought he would mend, but as\nsoon as he began to tinker it the thing went to pieces in his hands. The\nRevolution of 1848 proved an unpractical experiment, but it opened the\nway for Victor Emanuel and a more sound liberalism in 1859.",
        "We attended service at the Sistine Chapel yesterday in company with two\nyoung ladies from Philadelphia, who wore long black veils so that Pius\nIX. might not catch the least glimpse of their pretty faces. I was\ndisappointed in my hope of obtaining a view of the Pope’s face. Cardinal\nBonaparte sat just in front of us, a man well worth observing. He looks\nto be the ablest living member of that family, and bears a decided\nresemblance to the old Napoleon. His features are strong, his eyes keen,\nand he wears his red cap in a jaunty manner on the side of his head. When\nthe blessing was passed around the conclave of Cardinals, Bonaparte\ntransferred it to his next neighbor as if he meant to put it through him.\nIt is supposed that he will be the successor of Pius IX.; but, as Rev.\nSamuel Longfellow says, that will depend very much upon whether Louis\nNapoleon is alive at the time of the election.",
        "The singing in the Sistine Chapel is not worth listening to, besides\nhaving unpleasant associations; so during the service we had an excellent\nopportunity to study Michael Angelo’s Last Judgment—for there was\nnothing else to be done.",
        "Kugler considers the picture an inharmonious composition, and that\nnothing could be more disagreeable than the stout figure of St.\nBartholomew holding a flaying knife in one hand and his own mortal hide\nin the other. This is not a pleasant spectacle; but Michael Angelo did\nnot paint for other people’s pleasure, but rather to satisfy his own\nconscience. It was customary to introduce St. Bartholomew in this manner,\nfor there was no other way in which he could be identified. We found the\ntowering form of St. Christopher on the left side of the Saviour rather\nmore of an eyesore than St. Bartholomew, whose expression of awe\npartially redeems his appearance.",
        "The Saviour has a herculean frame, but his face and head are magnificent.\nHe has no beard, and his hair is arranged in festoons which gives the\nimpression of a wreath of grape leaves. The expression of his face is the\nnoblest I have seen in any work of art in Rome; the face that has risen\nthrough suffering; calm, compassionate, immutable. The Madonna seems like\na girl beside this stalwart form, and she draws close to her son with\nnaive timidity at the vast concourse which crowds about them. Her face is\nexpressive of resignation and compassion rather than any joyful feeling.",
        "The left side of this vast painting, in which the bodies of men and women\nare rising from their graves, is less interesting than the right side,\nwhere the saints and blessed are gathered together above and the sinners\nare hurled down below. Michael Angelo’s saints and apostles look like\nvigorous men of affairs, and are all rather stout and muscular. The\nattitudes of some of them are by no means conventional, but they are\nnatural and unconstrained. St. Peter, holding forth the keys, is a\nmagnificent figure. The group of the saved who are congregated above the\nsaints is the pleasantest portion of the picture. Here Damion and Pythias\nembrace each other; a young husband springs to greet the wife whom he\nlost too early; a poor unfortunate to whom life was a curse is timidly\nraising his eyes, scarcely believing that he is in paradise; men with\nfine philosophic heads converse together; and a number of honest serving-\nwomen express their astonishment with such gestures as are customary\namong that class of persons.",
        "In the lunettes above, wingless angels are hovering with the cross, the\ncolumn, and other instruments of Christ’s agony, which they clasp with a\nloving devotion. In the lower right-hand corner, Charon appears (taken\nfrom pagan mythology) with a boat-load of sinners, whom he smites with\nhis oar according to Dante’s description. He is truly a terrible demon,\nand his fiery eyes gleam across the length of the chapel. Minos, who\nreceives the boat-load in the likeness of Biagio da Cesena, the pope’s\nmaster of ceremonies, is another to match him. A modern fop with banged\nhair is stepping from the boat to the shore of hell. This is said to be\nthe best painted portion of the picture,—most life-like and free from\nmannerism. It is a mighty work, and too little appreciated, like many\nother works of art, chiefly owing to the critics, who do not understand\nit, and write a lingo of their own which is not easy to make out and does\nnot come to much after all. [Footnote: All this shows what a heart there\nwas in Michael Angelo, and dissipates the assertion of a recent English\nbiographer that Michael Angelo painted masks instead of faces, with\nlittle or no expression.]",
        "After the service we went into St. Peter’s with the ladies, and walked\nthe whole circuit of the church. Our ladies talked meanwhile exactly as\nthey might at an American watering-place, without apparently observing\nanything about them. When we came to the statue of St. Peter, P—— said,\npointing to the big toe: “You see there the mischief that can be done by\ntoo much kissing.” Nearly a third of the toe has been worn away by the\noscular applications of the faithful.",
        "Feb. 4.—Dr. B. B. Appleton, an American resident of Florence, is\nhere on a flying visit. We have heard from many sources of the kindness\nof this man to American travellers, especially to young students. In\nfact, he took P—— into his house while at Florence, and entertained him\nin the most generous manner. He has done the same for Mrs. Julia Ward\nHowe and many others. He lives with an Italian family who were formerly\nin the service of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and who were ruined by the\nrecent change of rulers. Dr. Appleton boards with them, and helps to\nsupport them in other ways. In spite of his goodness he does not seem to\nbe happy.",
        "One of his chief friends in Florence is Fraulein Assig, who was banished\nfrom Prussia together with her publisher for editing Von Humboldt’s\nmemoirs, which were perhaps too severely critical of the late king of\nPrussia. The book, however, had an excellent sale, and she now lives\ncontentedly in Florence, where she is well acquainted both with prominent\nliberals and leading members of the government. Dr. Appleton reports that\na cabinet officer lately said to her, “We may move to Rome at any time.”",
        "Louis Napoleon is the main-stay of the papacy, and the only one it has.\nThe retrocession of Venetia to Italy has separated Austria effectually\nfrom the states of the Church, and the Spaniards are too much taken up\nwith their internal affairs to interfere at present in the pope’s behalf.\nNapoleon’s health is known to be delicate, and prayers for his\npreservation are offered up daily in Roman churches. If he should die\nbefore his son comes of age great political changes may be looked for.",
        "Meanwhile murmurs of discontent are heard on all sides. The city is\nunclean and badly cared for. The civil offices are said to be filled\nmainly with nephews of cardinals and other prelates. Even Italians\nof the lower classes know enough of political economy to foresee that if\nRome was the capital of Italy it would be more prosperous than it is at\npresent. The value of land would rise, and all the small trades would\nflourish. This is what is really undermining the power of Pius IX. A most\ncurious sign of the times is the general belief among the Roman populace\nthat the Pope has an evil eye. How long since this originated I have not\nbeen able to learn; but it is not uncommon for those who chance to see\nthe pope in his carriage, especially women, to go immediately into the\nnearest church for purification. A few days since the train from Rome to\nFlorence ran into a buffalo, and the locomotive was thrown off the track.\nEven this was attributed to the fact that the engineer had encountered\nthe pope near the Quirinal the previous Sunday.",
        "Dr. Appleton told us a story at dinner about the youth of Louis Napoleon.\nHis Florentine housekeeper, Gori, remembers Hortense and her two sons\nvery distinctly; for Louis once met him in the Boboli Gardens and\ninsisted on his smoking a cigar, in order to laugh at him when it had\nmade him sick,—as it was Gori’s first experience with tobacco. He also\nsays that on one occasion when the young princes had some sort of a feast\ntogether, the others all gave the caterer from five to ten francs as a\npour-boir, but Louis Napoleon gave him a twenty-franc piece. When\nhis companions expressed their surprise at this Louis said: “It is only\nright that I should do so, for some day I shall be Emperor.”",
        "As a rule few Italian men attend church. The women go; but the men, if\nnot heretical, are at least rather indifferent, on the subject of\nreligion. Macaulay refers to this fact in his essay on Macchiavelli, and\nDr. Appleton, who has lived among them, knows it to be true. To make\namends for it, English and American ladies are returning to the fold of\nSt. Peter in large numbers; and many of them bring their male relatives\neventually with them. I believe this to be largely a matter of fashion.\nThey have always accepted the Protestant creed as a matter of course, and\ncoming here, where they are separated from all previous associations,\nthey find themselves out of tune with their surroundings. They feel\nlonely, as all travellers do at times, and being in need of sympathy are\neasily impressed by those about them. Most of them have Catholic maids,\nwho often serve as stepping-stones to the acquaintance of the priest.\nConversion gives them a kind of importance, which Catholic ladies of rank\nknow how to make the most of. The external grandeur of Catholicism as we\nsee it here has also its due influence.",
        "Feb. 9.—I was greatly disgusted last evening while calling on two\nNew England ladies, who were formerly my schoolmates, to have a pompous\npriest walk in and take possession of the parlor, spoiling my pleasant\ntete-a-tete. He sat in the middle of the room like a pail of\nwater, and stared about in the most ill-mannered way. My friends remarked\nthat he was the abbate of the Pantheon, and he inquired if I had\nbeen to see it; to which I replied that I had, and that I considered it\nthe noblest building in Rome. This seemed to be a new idea to him, and\none which he did not altogether like. Not long since I came upon a priest\ndrinking wine with some young artists, and laughing at jokes for which a\nstage-driver might be ashamed. There are fine exceptions among them, but\nas a class they appear to me coarse and even vicious,—by no means\nspiritually attractive. Monks are not attractive either, but in their way\nthey are much more interesting. Religion seems to be meat and drink to\nthem.",
        "P—— and I were invited to dine by an American Catholic lady who was\nformerly a friend of Margaret Fuller, and who having been incautiously\nleft in Rome by her husband, embraced Catholicism before he was fairly\nacross the Atlantic,—to his lasting sorrow and vexation. Being in an\ninfluential position she has made many converts, and it is said that she\nhas come to Rome on the present occasion to be sainted by the pope. She\nhas already loaned P—— a biography of Father Lacordaire, which he has\nnot had leisure to read. He referred to it, as soon as politeness\npermitted, with a shrewd inquiry as to whether the book did not give\nrather a rose-colored view of practical Catholicism. Mrs. X—— turned to\nher daughters and said with all imaginable sweetness: “Just hear him,—\nthe poor child!” Then she went off into a long, eloquent, and really\ninteresting discourse on the true, sole, and original Christian Church.\nShe admitted, however, that during the sixteenth century the Christian\nfaith had much fallen into decay, and that Martin Luther was not to be\nblamed for his exhortations against the evil practices of popes and\ncardinals. Now that the Church had been reformed it was altogether\ndifferent. She told us how she became converted. It came to her like a\nvision on a gloomy winter day, while she was looking into the embers of a\nwood-fire.",
        "Then she talked about Margaret Fuller, whom she called the most brilliant\nwoman she had ever known. She had never loved another woman so much; but\nit was a dangerous love. If she wrote a rather gushing letter to\nMargaret, she would receive in reply, “How could you have written so\nbeautifully! You must have been inspired.” This, she said, had all the\neffect of flattery without being intended for it, and was so much the\nmore mischievous. “Emerson and Margaret Fuller,” said Mrs. X——, “put\ninspiration in the place of religion. They believed that some people had\ndirect communication with the Almighty.” P—— and I thought this might\nbe true of Miss Fuller, but doubted it in Emerson’s case.",
        "Miss X—— told me that she had lately ascended to the rotunda of the\nCapitol, from which the pope’s flag flies all day, and that she had asked\nthe Swiss guard what he would do if she hoisted the tricolor there. He\nreplied: “I should shoot you.” Nothing could be more kind or truly\ncourteous than the manner in which these ladies treated us.",
        "Another distinguished convert here is Mrs. Margaret Eveleth, a rare,\nspirituelle woman, who was born within a mile of my father’s house. She\nwas formerly a Unitarian, but soon became a Catholic on coming to Rome.\nWhile she was in process of transition from one church to the other she\nwrote a number of letters to her former pastor in New York, requesting\ninformation on points of faith. Not one of these letters was ever\nanswered, and it is incredible to suppose that they would not have been\nif he had received them. It is highly probable that they never left Rome.\nI have myself been warned to attach my stamps to letters firmly, so that\nthey may not be stolen in passing through the Post-office. Postage here\nis also double what it is in Florence.",
        "Feb. 12.—I have been looking for some time to find a good picture\nof Marcus Aurelius, and have generally become known among Roman\nphotographers as the man who wants the Marc Aureli. This morning I\nhad just left my room when I discovered Rev. Samuel Longfellow in a\nphotograph shop in the Via Frattina. “I was just coming to see you,” he\nsaid; “and I stopped here to look for a photograph of Marcus Aurelius.\"\nHe laughed when I told him that I had been on the same quest, and\nsuggested that we should walk to the Capitol together and look at the\nstatue and bust of our favorite emperor. “I think he was the greatest of\nthe Romans,” said Mr. Longfellow, “if not the noblest of all the\nancients.”",
        "So we walked together—as we never shall again—through the long Corso\nwith its array of palaces, past the column of Aurelius and the fragments\nof Trajan’s forum, until we reached the ancient Capitol of Rome,\nrearranged by Michael Angelo. Here we stood before the equestrian statue\nof Marcus Aurelius, and considered how it might be photographed to\nadvantage. “I do not think,” said Rev. Mr. Longfellow, “that we can\nobtain a satisfactory picture of it. The face is too dark to be\nexpressive, and it is the man’s face that I want; and I suppose you do\nalso.”",
        "I asked him how he could explain the creation of such a noble statue in\nthe last decline of Greek art; he said he would not attempt to explain it\nexcept on the ground that things do not always turn out as critics and\nhistorians would have them. It was natural that the arts should revive\nsomewhat under the patronage of Hadrian and the Antonines.",
        "We went into the museum of the Capitol to look for the bust of the young\nAurelius, which shone like a star (to use Homer’s expression) among its\nfellows, but we discovered from the earth-stains on portions of it why\nthe photographers had not succeeded better with it. We decided that our\nbest resource would be to have Mr. Appleton’s copy of it photographed,\nand Rev. Mr. Longfellow agreed to undertake the business with me in the\nforenoon of the next day.",
        "The busts of the Roman emperors were interesting because their characters\nare so strongly marked in history. The position would seem to have made\neither brutes or heroes of them. Tiberius, who was no doubt the natural\nson of Augustus, resembles him as a donkey does a horse. Caligula, Nero,\nand Domitian had small, feminine features; Nero a bullet-head and sensual\nlips, but the others quite refined. During the first six years of Nero’s\nreign he was not so bad as he afterwards became; and I saw an older bust\nof him in Paris which is too horrible to be looked at more than once.\nVespasian has a coarse face, but wonderfully good-humored; and Titus,\ncalled “the delight of mankind,” looks like an improvement on Augustus.\nThe youthful Commodus bears a decided resemblance to his father, and\nthere is no indication in his face to suggest the monster which he\nfinally became.",
        "Early in the next forenoon I reached the Hotel Costanzi in good season\nand inquired for the Rev. Mr. Longfellow. He soon appeared, together with\nMr. T. G. Appleton, who was evidently pleased at my interest in the young\nAurelius, and remarked that it was a more interesting work than the young\nAugustus. The bust had been sent to William Story’s studio to be cleaned,\nand thither we all proceeded in the best possible spirits.",
        "We found a photographer named Giovanni Braccia on the floor a\npiano above Mr. Story; and after a lengthy discussion with him, in\nwhich Mr. Longfellow was the leading figure, he agreed to take the\nphotographs at two napoleons a dozen. [Footnote: These pictures proved to\nbe fine reproductions, and are still to be met with in Boston and\nCambridge parlors.] When the bust was brought in Mr. Longfellow called my\nattention to the incisions representing pupils in the eyes, which he said\nwere a late introduction in sculpture, and not generally considered an\nimprovement. After this Mr. Appleton called to us to come with him to the\nstudio of an English painter in the same building, whose name I cannot\nnow recollect. He was the type of a graceful, animated young artist, and\nhad just finished a painting representing ancient youths and maidens in a\nprocession with the light coming from the further side, so that their\nfaces were mostly in shadow, with bright line along the profile,—an\neffect which it requires skill to render.",
        "On returning to the street we looked into Mr. Story’s outer room again,\nwhere the casts of all his statues were seated in a double row like\npersons at a theatre. Mr. Appleton was rather severe in his criticism of\nthem, though he admitted that the Cleopatra (which I believe was a\nreplica) had a finely modulated face.",
        "Feb. 15.—Warrington Wood invited P—— and myself to lunch with\nhim in his studio, and at the appointed time a waiter appeared from the\nLapre with a great tin box on his shoulder filled with spaghetti,\nroast goat, and other Italian dishes. We had just spread these on a table\nin front of the clay model of Michael and Satan, when Wood’s marble-\ncutter rushed in to announce the King and Queen of Naples. Wood hastily\nthrew a green curtain over the dishes, while P—— and I retreated to the\nfurther end of the room.",
        "The Queen of Naples is a fine-looking and spirited person, still quite\nyoung, and talks English well. She conversed with Wood and asked him a\nnumber of questions about his group, and also about the stag-hound, Eric,\nthat was standing sentinel. The King said almost nothing, and moving\nabout as if he know not what to do with himself, finally backed up\nagainst the table where our lunch was covered by the green cloth. I think\nhe had an idea of sitting down on it, but the dishes set up such a\nclatter that he beat a hasty retreat. The King did not move a muscle of\nhis countenance, but the Queen looked around and said something to him in\nItalian, laughing pleasantly. She is said to be friendly to Americans and\nis quite intimate with Miss Harriet Hosmer. She is at least a woman of\nnoble courage, and when Garibaldi besieged Naples she went on to the\nramparts and rallied the soldiers with the shells bursting about her.",
        "They subscribed themselves in Wood’s register under the name of Bourbon,\nand after their departure we found our lunch cold, but perhaps we\nrelished it better for this visitation of royalty. Then we all went to\nthe carnival, where an Italian lazzaroni attempted to pick Wood’s\npocket, but was caught in the act and soundly kicked by Wood.",
        "This was the most entertaining event of the afternoon. The best part of\nthe carnival was the quantity of fresh flowers that were brought in from\nthe country and sold at very moderate prices. P—— distinguished himself\nthrowing bouquets to ladies in the balconies. It is said that he has an\nadmirer among them. For the first hour or so I found it entertaining\nenough, but after that I became weary of its endless repetition. Eighty\nyears since Goethe, seated in one of these balconies, was obliged to ask\nfor paper and pencil to drive away ennui, as he afterwards\nconfessed. The carnival now is almost entirely given up to the English\nand Americans; while many of the lower class of Italians mix in it\ndisguised in masks and fancy dresses. Four masked young women greeted us\nwith confetti and danced about me on the sidewalk. One tipped up my hat\nbehind and another whispered a name in my ear which I did not suppose was\nknown in Europe. I have not yet discovered who they were.",
        "Feb. 19.—I have had the pleasure of dining with that remarkable\nwoman and once distinguished actress, Miss Charlotte Cushman. Her nephew\nwas consul at Rome, appointed by William II. Seward, who was one of her\nwarmest American friends. She is still queen of the stage, and of her own\nhousehold, and unconsciously gives orders to the servants in a dramatic\nmanner which is sometimes very amusing. So it was to hear her sing,\n“Mary, call the cattle home,” as if she were sending for the heavy\nartillery. She impresses me, however, as one of the most genuine of\nwomankind; and her conversation is delightful,—so sympathetic,\nappreciative, full of strong good sense, and fresh original views. She\nhas small mercy on newly-converted Catholics. “The faults of men,” she\nsaid, “are chiefly those of strength, but the faults of my own sex arise\nfrom weakness.” I happened to refer to Mr. Appleton’s bust of Aurelius,\nand she said she was surprised he had purchased it, for it did not seem\nto her a satisfactory copy; a conclusion that I had been slowly coming to\nmyself. She has a bronze replica of Story’s “Beethoven” which, like most\nof his statues, is seated in a chair, and a rather realistic work, as\nMiss Cushman admitted. I judged from the conversation at table that she\nis not treated with full respect by the English and American society\nhere, although looked upon as a distinguished person. The reason for this\nmay be more owing to the social position of her relatives than her former\nprofession. Mrs. Trelawney, the wife of Byron’s eccentric friend, spoke\nof her to me a few days ago in terms of the highest esteem. She is a\ngreat-hearted woman, and her presence would be a moral power anywhere.",
        "There is snobbishness enough in Rome—English, American, and Italian.\nDoolittle, who is the son of a highly respectable New York lawyer, went\nto the hunt last week, as he openly confessed, to give himself\ndistinction. A young lady was thrown from her horse, and he was the first\nperson to come to her assistance. She thanked him for it at the time, but\ntwo days afterwards declined to recognize his acquaintance. This was\nprobably because he was an artist, or rather sets up for one, for he is\nmore like a gentleman of leisure.",
