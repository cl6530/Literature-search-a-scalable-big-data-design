        "January 1.–I awoke late this forenoon with a pain through the head and a\ntaste of ennui in the mouth, which I can hardly account for. Can it be a\nresult of the party last evening? I ween it may be so. We had a lovely\ncard party last evening. It was very enjoyable, indeed. Whist was the\ngame.",
        "January 3.–Yesterday all day I was unable to leave my room, owing to a\nheadache and nervous prostration, caused by late hours and too much\ncompany, the doctor said. It is too bad, and yet I do so much enjoy our\ncard parties and the excitement of the game. To-night I am to take part in\na little quiet game of draw poker, I think they call it. I have not had\nany experience heretofore in the game, but trust I shall soon learn it.\nThere has been some talk about £1 ante and £5 limit. I do not exactly\nunderstand the terms. I hope it does not mean anything wrong.",
        "January 4.–Poker is an odd game, indeed. I think it quite exciting,\nthough at first the odd terms rather confused me. I had not been\naccustomed to such phrases as “show down,” “bob-tail flush,” and “King\nfull.” I must ask Brown, as soon as his knees are able to be out, to\nexplain the meaning of these terms a little more fully to me. If poor\nBrown’s knees are not better soon, I shall be on kneesy about him. [Here\nthe diary has the appearance of being blurred with tears.] A bob-tail\nflush, I learn, is something very disagreeable to have. One gentleman said\nlast evening that another bob-tail flush would certainly paralyze him. I\ngather from that that it is something like a hectic flush. I can\nunderstand the game called “old sledge,” and have become quite familiar\nwith such terms as “beg,” “gimmeone,” “I’ve got the thin one,” “how high\nis that?” “one horse on me,” “saw-off,” etc., etc., but poker is full of\nsurprises. It seems so odd to see a gentleman “show out on a pair of\ndeuces” and gather in upward of two pounds with great merriment, while the\nremainder of the party seem quite bored. One gentleman last evening showed\nout on a full hand with “treys at the head,” putting £3 12s. in his purse\nwith great glee, while another one of the party who had not shown up, but\nI am positive had a better hand, became so angered that he got up and\nkicked four front teeth out of the mouth of a favorite dog worth £20. I\ntook part in a spade flush during the evening and was quite successful, so\nthat I can easily pay my traveling expenses and have a few shillings to\nbuy ointment for poor Brown. It was my first winning, and made me quiver\nall over with excitement. The game is already very fascinating to me, and\nI am becoming passionately fond of it.",
        "January 6.–I have just learned fully what a bob-tail flush is. It cost me\n£50. I like information, but I do not like to buy it when it comes so\nhigh. I drew two to fill in a heart flush last evening, and advanced the\nmoney to back up my judgment; but one of the hearts I drew was a club,\nwhich was entirely useless to me. I have sent out a sheriff with a bulldog\nto ascertain if he can find the whereabouts of the party who started this\npoker game, I do not know when I have felt so bored. After that I was so\ntimid that I allowed a friend to walk off with £2 on a pair of deuces. I\nsaid to him that I called that a deuced bore, and he laughed heartily.",
        "I find that you should not be too ready to show by your countenance\nwhether you are bored or pleased in poker. Tour opponent will take\nadvantage of it and play accordingly. It cost me £8 10s. to acquire a\nknowledge of this fact. If all the information I ever got had cost me as\nmuch as this poker wisdom, I would not now have two pennies to jingle\ntogether in my purse. Still, we have had a good time, take it all in all,\nand I shall not soon forget the evenings we have spent here together\nbuying knowledge regardless of cost. I think I shall try to control my\nwild thirst for information awhile, however, till I can get some more\nfunds.",
