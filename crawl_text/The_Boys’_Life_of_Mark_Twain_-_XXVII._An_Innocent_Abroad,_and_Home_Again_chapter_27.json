        "It was early in May–the 6th–that Mark Twain had delivered his Cooper\nUnion lecture, and a month later, June 8, 1867, he sailed on the “Quaker\nCity,” with some sixty-six other “pilgrims,” on the great Holy Land\nexcursion, the story of which has been so fully and faithfully told in\n“The Innocent Abroad.”",
        "What a wonderful thing it must have seemed in that time for a party of\nexcursionists to have a ship all to themselves to go a-gipsying in from\nport to port of antiquity and romance!  The advertised celebrities did\nnot go, none of them but Mark Twain, but no one minded, presently, for\nMark Twain’s sayings and stories kept the company sufficiently\nentertained, and sometimes he would read aloud to his fellow-passengers\nfrom the newspaper letters he was writing, and invite comment and\ncriticism.  That was entertainment for them, and it was good for him, for\nit gave him an immediate audience, always inspiring to an author.\nFurthermore, the comments offered were often of the greatest value,\nespecially suggestions from one Mrs. Fairbanks, of Cleveland, a middle-\naged, cultured woman, herself a correspondent for her husband’s paper,\nthe “Herald”.  It requires not many days for acquaintances to form on\nshipboard, and in due time a little group gathered regularly each\nafternoon to hear Mark Twain read what he had written of their day’s\ndoings, though some of it he destroyed later because Mrs. Fairbanks\nthought it not his best.",
        "All of the “pilgrims” mentioned in “The Innocents Abroad” were real\npersons.  “Dan” was Dan Slote, Mark Twain’s room-mate; the Doctor who\nconfused the guides was Dr. A. Reeves Jackson, of Chicago; the poet\nLariat was Bloodgood H. Cutter, an eccentric from Long Island; “Jack” was\nJack Van Nostrand, of New Jersey; and “Moult” and “Blucher” and “Charlie\"\nwere likewise real, the last named being Charles J. Langdon, of Elmira,\nN. Y., a boy of eighteen, whose sister would one day become Mark Twain’s\nwife.",
        "It has been said that Mark Twain first met Olivia Langdon on the “Quaker\nCity,” but this is not quite true; he met only her picture–the original\nwas not on that ship.  Charlie Langdon, boy fashion, made a sort of hero\nof the brilliant man called Mark Twain, and one day in the Bay of Smyrna\ninvited him to his cabin and exhibited his treasures, among them a dainty\nminiature of a sister at home, Olivia, a sweet, delicate creature whom\nthe boy worshiped.",
        "Samuel Clemens gazed long at the exquisite portrait and spoke of it\nreverently, for in the sweet face he seemed to find something spiritual.\nOften after that he came to young Langdon’s cabin to look at the pictured\ncountenance, in his heart dreaming of a day when he might learn to know\nits owner.",
        "We need not follow in detail here the travels of the “pilgrims” and their\nadventures.  Most of them have been fully set down in “The Innocents\nAbroad,” and with not much elaboration, for plenty of amusing things were\nhappening on a trip of that kind, and Mark Twain’s old note-books are\nfull of the real incidents that we find changed but little in the book.\nIf the adventures of Jack, Dan, and the Doctor are embroidered here and\nthere, the truth is always there, too.",
        "Yet the old note-books have a very intimate interest of their own.  It is\ncurious to be looking through them to-day, trying to realize that those\npenciled memoranda were the fresh first impressions that would presently\ngrow into the world’s most delightful book of travel; that they were set\ndown in the very midst of that historic little company that frolicked\nthrough Italy and climbed wearily the arid Syrian hills.",
        "It required five months for the “Quaker City” to make the circuit of the\nMediterranean and return to New York.  Mark Twain in that time\ncontributed fifty two or three letters to the “Alta California” and six\nto the “New York Tribune,” or an average of nearly three a week–a vast\namount of labor to be done in the midst of sight-seeing.  And what\nletters of travel they were!  The most remarkable that had been written\nup to that time.  Vivid, fearless, full of fresh color, humor, poetry,\nthey came as a revelation to a public weary of the tiresome descriptive\ndrivel of that day.  They preached a new gospel in travel literature–the\ngospel of seeing honestly and speaking frankly–a gospel that Mark Twain\nwould continue to preach during the rest of his career.",
        "Furthermore, the letters showed a great literary growth in their author.\nNo doubt the cultivated associations of the ship, the afternoon reading\naloud of his work, and Mrs. Fairbanks’s advice had much to do with this.\nBut we may believe, also, that the author’s close study of the King James\nversion of the Old Testament during the weeks of travel through Palestine\nexerted a powerful influence upon his style.  The man who had recited\n“The Burial of Moses” to Joe Goodman, with so much feeling, could not\nfail to be mastered by the simple yet stately Bible phrase and imagery.\nMany of the fine descriptive passages in “The Innocents Abroad” have\nsomething almost Biblical in their phrasing.  The writer of this memoir\nheard in childhood “The Innocents Abroad” read aloud, and has never\nforgotten the poetic spell that fell upon him as he listened to a\nparagraph written of Tangier:",
        "“Here is a crumbled wall that was old when Columbus discovered\n     America; old when Peter the Hermit roused the knightly men of the\n     Middle Ages to arm for the first Crusade; old when Charlemagne and\n     his paladins beleaguered enchanted castles and battled with giants\n     and genii in the fabled days of the olden time; old when Christ and\n     His disciples walked the earth; stood where it stands to-day when\n     the lips of Memnon were vocal and men bought and sold in the streets\n     of ancient Thebes.”",
        "Mark Twain returned to America to find himself, if not famous, at least\nin very high repute.  The “Alta” and “Tribune” letters had carried his\nname to every corner of his native land.  He was in demand now.  To his\nmother he wrote:",
        "“I have eighteen offers to lecture, at $100 each, in various parts of\n     the Union–have declined them all .  .  .  .  Belong on the\n     “Tribune” staff and shall write occasionally.  Am offered the same\n     berth to-day on the ’Herald,’ by letter.”",
        "He was in Washington at this time, having remained in New York but one\nday.  He had accepted a secretaryship from Senator Stewart of Nevada, but\nthis arrangement was a brief one.  He required fuller freedom for his\nWashington correspondence and general literary undertakings.",
        "He had been in Washington but a few days when he received a letter that\nmeant more to him than he could possibly have dreamed at the moment.  It\nwas from Elisha Bliss, Jr., manager of the American Publishing Company,\nof Hartford, Connecticut, and it suggested gathering the Mediterranean\ntravel-letters into a book.  Bliss was a capable, energetic man, with a\ntaste for humor, and believed there was money for author and publisher in\nthe travel-book.",
        "The proposition pleased Mark Twain, who replied at once, asking for\nfurther details as to Bliss’s plan.  Somewhat later he made a trip to\nHartford, and the terms for the publication of “The Innocents Abroad\"\nwere agreed upon.  It was to be a large illustrated book for subscription\nsale, and the author was to receive five per cent of the selling price.\nBliss had offered him the choice between this royalty and ten thousand\ndollars cash.  Though much tempted by the large sum to be paid in hand,\nMark Twain decided in favor of the royalty plan–\"the best business\njudgment I ever displayed,” he used to say afterward.  He agreed to\narrange the letters for book publication, revising and rewriting where\nnecessary, and went back to Washington well pleased.  He did not realize\nthat his agreement with Bliss marked the beginning of one of the most\nnotable publishing connections in American literary history.",
