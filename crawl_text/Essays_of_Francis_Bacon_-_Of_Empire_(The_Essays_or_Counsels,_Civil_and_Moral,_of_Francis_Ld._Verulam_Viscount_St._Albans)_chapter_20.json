        "IT IS a miserable state of mind, to have few\nthings to desire, and many things to fear; and\nyet that commonly is the case of kings; who, being\nat the highest, want matter of desire, which makes\ntheir minds more languishing; and have many representations of perils and shadows, which makes\ntheir minds the less clear.  And this is one reason\nalso, of that effect which the Scripture speaketh of,\nThat the king’s heart is inscrutable.  For multitude\nof jealousies, and lack of some predominant desire, that should marshal and put in order all the\nrest, maketh any man’s heart, hard to find or\nsound.  Hence it comes likewise, that princes many\ntimes make themselves desires, and set their hearts\nupon toys; sometimes upon a building; sometimes\nupon erecting of an order; sometimes upon the advancing of a person; sometimes upon obtaining\nexcellency in some art, or feat of the hand; as Nero\nfor playing on the harp, Domitian for certainty\nof the hand with the arrow, Commodus for playing at fence, Caracalla for driving chariots, and\nthe like.  This seemeth incredible, unto those that\nknow not the principle, that the mind of man, is\nmore cheered and refreshed by profiting in small\nthings, than by standing at a stay, in great.  We see\nalso that kings that have been fortunate conquerors, in their first years, it being not possible for\nthem to go forward infinitely, but that they must\nhave some check, or arrest in their fortunes, turn\nin their latter years to be superstitious, and melancholy; as did Alexander the Great; Diocletian; and\nin our memory, Charles the Fifth; and others: for\nhe that is used to go forward, and findeth a stop,\nfalleth out of his own favor, and is not the thing\nhe was.",
        "To speak now of the true temper of empire, it is\na thing rare and hard to keep; for both temper, and\ndistemper, consist of contraries.  But it is one thing,\nto mingle contraries, another to interchange them.\nThe answer of Apollonius to Vespasian, is full of\nexcellent instruction.  Vespasian asked him, What\nwas Nero’s overthrow? He answered, Nero could\ntouch and tune the harp well; but in government,\nsometimes he used to wind the pins too high, sometimes to let them down too low.  And certain it is,\nthat nothing destroyeth authority so much, as the\nunequal and untimely interchange of power\npressed too far, and relaxed too much.",
        "This is true, that the wisdom of all these latter\ntimes, in princes’ affairs, is rather fine deliveries,\nand shiftings of dangers and mischiefs, when they\nare near, than solid and grounded courses to keep\nthem aloof.  But this is but to try masteries with\nfortune.  And let men beware, how they neglect\nand suffer matter of trouble to be prepared; for no\nman can forbid the spark, nor tell whence it may\ncome.  The difficulties in princes’ business are many\nand great; but the greatest difficulty, is often in\ntheir own mind.  For it is common with princes\n(saith Tacitus) to will contradictories, Sunt plerumque regum voluntates vehementes, et inter se\ncontrariae.  For it is the solecism of power, to think\nto command the end, and yet not to endure the\nmean.",
        "Kings have to deal with their neighbors, their\nwives, their children, their prelates or clergy, their\nnobles, their second-nobles or gentlemen, their\nmerchants, their commons, and their men of war;\nand from all these arise dangers, if care and circumspection be not used.",
        "First for their neighbors; there can no general\nrule be given (for occasions are so variable), save\none, which ever holdeth, which is, that princes do\nkeep due sentinel, that none of their neighbors do\never grow so (by increase of territory, by embracing of trade, by approaches, or the like), as they\nbecome more able to annoy them, than they were.\nAnd this is generally the work of standing counsels, to foresee and to hinder it.  During that triumvirate of kings, King Henry the Eighth of England,\nFrancis the First King of France, and Charles the\nFifth Emperor, there was such a watch kept, that\nnone of the three could win a palm of ground, but\nthe other two would straightways balance it,\neither by confederation, or, if need were, by a war;\nand would not in any wise take up peace at interest.  And the like was done by that league (which\nGuicciardini saith was the security of Italy) made\nbetween Ferdinando King of Naples, Lorenzius\nMedici, and Ludovicus Sforza, potentates, the one\nof Florence, the other of Milan.  Neither is the opinion of some of the Schoolmen, to be received, that a\nwar cannot justly be made, but upon a precedent\ninjury or provocation.  For there is no question, but\na just fear of an imminent danger, though there be\nno blow given, is a lawful cause of a war.",
        "For their wives; there are cruel examples of\nthem.  Livia is infamed, for the poisoning of her\nhusband; Roxalana, Solyman’s wife, was the\ndestruction of that renowned prince, Sultan Mustapha, and otherwise troubled his house and succession; Edward the Second of England, his queen,\nhad the principal hand in the deposing and murder of her husband.  This kind of danger, is then to\nbe feared chiefly, when the wives have plots, for\nthe raising of their own children; or else that they\nbe advoutresses.",
        "For their children; the tragedies likewise of\ndangers from them, have been many.  And generally, the entering of fathers into suspicion of\ntheir children, hath been ever unfortunate.  The\ndestruction of Mustapha (that we named before)\nwas so fatal to Solyman’s line, as the succession of\nthe Turks, from Solyman until this day, is suspected to be untrue, and of strange blood; for that\nSelymus the Second, was thought to be suppositious.  The destruction of Crispus, a young prince of\nrare towardness, by Constantinus the Great, his\nfather, was in like manner fatal to his house; for\nboth Constantinus and Constance, his sons, died\nviolent deaths; and Constantius, his other son, did\nlittle better; who died indeed of sickness, but after\nthat Julianus had taken arms against him.  The destruction of Demetrius, son to Philip the Second of\nMacedon, turned upon the father, who died of\nrepentance.  And many like examples there are;\nbut few or none, where the fathers had good by\nsuch distrust; except it were, where the sons were\nup in open arms against them; as was Selymus the\nFirst against Bajazet; and the three sons of Henry\nthe Second, King of England.",
        "For their prelates; when they are proud and\ngreat, there is also danger from them; as it was in\nthe times of Anselmus, and Thomas Becket, Archbishops of Canterbury; who, with their croziers,\ndid almost try it with the king’s sword; and yet\nthey had to deal with stout and haughty kings,\nWilliam Rufus, Henry the First, and Henry the\nSecond.  The danger is not from that state, but\nwhere it hath a dependence of foreign authority;\nor where the churchmen come in and are elected,\nnot by the collation of the king, or particular\npatrons, but by the people.",
        "For their nobles; to keep them at a distance, it is\nnot amiss; but to depress them, may make a king\nmore absolute, but less safe; and less able to perform, any thing that he desires.  I have noted it, in\nmy History of King Henry the Seventh of England, who depressed bis nobility; whereupon it\ncame to pass, that his times were full of difficulties\nand troubles; for the nobility, though they continued loyal unto him, yet did they not co-operate\nwith him in his business.  So that in effect, he was\nfain to do all things himself.",
        "For their second-nobles; there is not much danger from them, being a body dispersed.  They may\nsometimes discourse high, but that doth little hurt;\nbesides, they are a counterpoise to the higher nobility, that they grow not too potent; and, lastly,\nbeing the most immediate in authority, with the\ncommon people, they do best temper popular commotions.",
        "For their merchants; they are vena porta; and\nif they flourish not, a kingdom may have good\nlimbs, but will have empty veins, and nourish\nlittle.  Taxes and imposts upon them, do seldom\ngood to the king’s revenue; for that that he wins in\nthe hundred, he leeseth in the shire; the particular\nrates being increased, but the total bulk of trading,\nrather decreased.",
        "For their commons; there is little danger from\nthem, except it be, where they have great and potent heads; or where you meddle with the point of\nreligion, or their customs, or means of life.",
        "For their men of war; it is a dangerous state,\nwhere they live and remain in a body, and are\nused to donatives; whereof we see examples in the\njanizaries, and pretorian bands of Rome; but trainings of men, and arming them in several places,\nand under several commanders, and without\ndonatives, are things of defence, and no danger.",
        "Princes are like to heavenly bodies, which cause\ngood or evil times; and which have much veneration, but no rest.  All precepts concerning kings,\nare in effect comprehended in those two remembrances: memento quod es homo; and memento\nquod es Deus, or vice Dei; the one bridleth their\npower, and the other their will.",
