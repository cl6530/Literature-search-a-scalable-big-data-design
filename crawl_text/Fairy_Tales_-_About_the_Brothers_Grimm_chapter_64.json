        "The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were\nborn in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse.\nThroughout their lives they remained close friends, and both studied\nlaw at Marburg University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German\nphilology, and although Wilhelm’s work was hampered by poor health the\nbrothers collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not\ncompleted until a century after their deaths. But they were best (and\nuniversally) known for the collection of over two hundred folk tales\nthey made from oral sources and published in two volumes of ’Nursery\nand Household Tales’ in 1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to\npreserve such material as part of German cultural and literary\nhistory, and their collection was first published with scholarly notes\nand no illustration, the tales soon came into the possession of young\nreaders. This was in part due to Edgar Taylor, who made the first\nEnglish translation in 1823, selecting about fifty stories ’with the\namusement of some young friends principally in view.’ They have been\nan essential ingredient of children’s reading ever since.",
