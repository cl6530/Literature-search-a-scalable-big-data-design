        "\nI awoke rejoicing, and began to reflect on the glorious career\nbefore me.  I would go forth, methought, at once, and evangelize\nthe whole of Flatland.  Even to Women and Soldiers should the Gospel\nof Three Dimensions be proclaimed.  I would begin with my Wife.",
        "Just as I had decided on the plan of my operations, I heard\nthe sound of many voices in the street commanding silence.\nThen followed a louder voice.  It was a herald’s proclamation.\nListening attentively, I recognized the words of the Resolution\nof the Council, enjoining the arrest, imprisonment, or execution\nof any one who should pervert the minds of the people by delusions,\nand by professing to have received revelations from another World.",
        "I reflected.  This danger was not to be trifled with.  It would be\nbetter to avoid it by omitting all mention of my Revelation,\nand by proceeding on the path of Demonstration — which after all,\nseemed so simple and so conclusive that nothing would be lost\nby discarding the former means.  “Upward, not Northward” —\nwas the clue to the whole proof.  It had seemed to me fairly clear\nbefore I fell asleep; and when I first awoke, fresh from my dream,\nit had appeared as patent as Arithmetic; but somehow it did not\nseem to me quite so obvious now.  Though my Wife entered the room\nopportunely just at that moment, I decided, after we had exchanged\na few words of commonplace conversation, not to begin with her.",
        "My Pentagonal Sons were men of character and standing,\nand physicians of no mean reputation, but not great in mathematics,\nand, in that respect, unfit for my purpose.  But it occurred to me\nthat a young and docile Hexagon, with a mathematical turn,\nwould be a most suitable pupil.  Why therefore not make\nmy first experiment with my little precocious Grandson,\nwhose casual remarks on the meaning of 3^3 had met with the approval\nof the Sphere?  Discussing the matter with him, a mere boy,\nI should be in perfect safety; for he would know nothing\nof the Proclamation of the Council; whereas I could not feel sure\nthat my Sons — so greatly did their patriotism and reverence\nfor the Circles predominate over mere blind affection —\nmight not feel compelled to hand me over to the Prefect,\nif they found me seriously maintaining the seditious heresy\nof the Third Dimension.",
        "But the first thing to be done was to satisfy in some way\nthe curiosity of my Wife, who naturally wished to know\nsomething of the reasons for which the Circle had desired\nthat mysterious interview, and of the means by which he had\nentered the house.  Without entering into the details\nof the elaborate account I gave her, — an account, I fear,\nnot quite so consistent with truth as my Readers in Spaceland\nmight desire, — I must be content with saying that I succeeded\nat last in persuading her to return quietly to her household duties\nwithout eliciting from me any reference to the World\nof Three Dimensions.  This done, I immediately sent for my Grandson;\nfor, to confess the truth, I felt that all that I had seen and heard\nwas in some strange way slipping away from me, like the image\nof a half-grasped, tantalizing dream, and I longed to essay my skill\nin making a first disciple.",
        "When my Grandson entered the room I carefully secured the door.\nThen, sitting down by his side and taking our mathematical tablets,\n— or, as you would call them, Lines — I told him we would resume\nthe lesson of yesterday.  I taught him once more how a Point by motion\nin One Dimension produces a Line, and how a straight Line\nin Two Dimensions produces a Square.  After this, forcing a laugh,\nI said, “And now, you scamp, you wanted to make me believe\nthat a Square may in the same way by motion ’Upward, not Northward’\nproduce another figure, a sort of extra Square in Three Dimensions.\nSay that again, you young rascal.”",
        "At this moment we heard once more the herald’s “O yes! O yes!\"\noutside in the street proclaiming the Resolution of the Council.\nYoung though he was, my Grandson — who was unusually intelligent\nfor his age, and bred up in perfect reverence for the authority\nof the Circles — took in the situation with an acuteness for which\nI was quite unprepared.  He remained silent till the last words\nof the Proclamation had died away, and then, bursting into tears,\n“Dear Grandpapa,” he said, “that was only my fun, and of course\nI meant nothing at all by it; and we did not know anything then\nabout the new Law; and I don’t think I said anything about\nthe Third Dimension; and I am sure I did not say one word about\n’Upward, not Northward’, for that would be such nonsense,\nyou know.  How could a thing move Upward, and not Northward?\nUpward and not Northward!  Even if I were a baby, I could not be\nso absurd as that.  How silly it is!  Ha! ha! ha!”",
        "“Not at all silly,” said I, losing my temper; “here for example,\nI take this Square,” and, at the word, I grasped a moveable Square,\nwhich was lying at hand — “and I move it, you see, not Northward but\n— yes, I move it Upward — that is to say, not Northward,\nbut I move it somewhere — not exactly like this, but somehow --\"\nHere I brought my sentence to an inane conclusion, shaking the Square\nabout in a purposeless manner, much to the amusement of my Grandson,\nwho burst out laughing louder than ever, and declared that I was not\nteaching him, but joking with him; and so saying he unlocked the door\nand ran out of the room.  Thus ended my first attempt to convert\na pupil to the Gospel of Three Dimensions.",
