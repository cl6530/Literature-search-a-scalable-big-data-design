        "IN THE WOODS",
        "Really in the Woods",
        "“Ye seem to waste a powerful lot o’ time goin’ up an’ down to yer camp;\nwhy don’t ye stay thayer altogether?” said Raften one day, in the\ncolourless style that always worried every one, for they did not know\nwhether it was really meant or was mere sarcasm.",
        "“Suits me. ’Tain’t our choice to come home,” replied his son.",
        "“We’d like nothing better than to sleep there, too,” said Yan.",
        "“Well, why don’t ye? That’s what I’d do if I was a boy playin’ Injun;\nI’d go right in an’ play.”",
        "“_All right now,” drawled Sam (he always drawled in proportion\nto his emphasis), “that suits us; now we’re a-going sure.”",
        "“All right, bhoys,” said Raften; “but mind ye the pigs an’ cattle’s to\nbe ’tended to every day.”",
        "“Is that what ye call lettin’ us camp out–come home to work jest the\nsame?”",
        "“No, no, William,” interposed Mrs. Raften; “that’s not fair. That’s no\nway to give them a holiday. Either do it or don’t. Surely one of the\nmen can do the chores for a month.”",
        "“Month–I didn’t say nothin’ about a month.”",
        "“Well, why don’t you now?”",
        "“Whoi, a month would land us into harvest,” and William had the air of\na man at bay, finding them all against him.",
        "“I’ll do Yahn’s chores for a fortnight if he’ll give me that thayer\npictur he drawed of the place,” now came in Michel’s voice from\nthe far end of the table–\"except Sunday,” he added, remembering a\nstanding engagement, which promised to result in something of vast\nimportance to him.",
        "“Wall, I’ll take care o’ them Sundays,” said Si Lee.",
        "“Yer all agin me,” grumbled William with comical perplexity. “But\nbhoys ought to be bhoys. Ye kin go.”",
        "“Whoop!” yelled Sam.",
        "“Hooray!” joined in Yan, with even more interest though with less\nunrestraint.",
        "“But howld on, I ain’t through–”",
        "“I say, Da, we want your gun. We can’t go camping without a gun.”",
        "“Howld on, now. Give me a chance to finish. Ye can go fur two weeks,\nbut ye got to go; no snakin’ home nights to sleep. Ye can’t hev\nno matches an’ no gun. I won’t hev a lot o’ children foolin’ wid a\ndidn’t-know-it-was-loaded, an’ shootin’ all the birds and squirrels\nan’ each other, too. Ye kin hev yer bows an’ arrows an’ ye ain’t\nlikely to do no harrum. Ye kin hev all the mate an’ bread an’ stuff\nye want, but ye must cook it yerselves, an’ if I see any signs of\nsettin’ the Woods afire I’ll be down wid the rawhoide an’ cut the\nvery livers out o’ ye.”",
        "The rest of the morning was devoted to preparation, Mrs. Raften taking\nthe leading hand.",
        "“Now, who’s to be cook?” she asked.",
        "“Sam\"–\"Yan\"–said the boys in the same breath.",
        "“Hm! You seem in one mind about it. Suppose you take it turn and turn\nabout–Sam first day.”",
        "Then followed instructions for making coffee in the morning, boiling\npotatoes, frying bacon. Bread and butter enough they were to take with\nthem–eggs, too.",
        "“You better come home for milk every day or every other day, at\nleast,” remarked the mother.",
        "“We’d ruther steal it from the cows in the pasture,” ventured Sam,\n“seems naturaler to me Injun blood.”",
        "“If I ketch ye foolin’ round the cows or sp’ilin’ them the fur’ll\nfly,” growled Raften.",
        "“Well, kin we hook apples and cherries?” and Sam added in explanation;\n“they’re no good to us unless they’re hooked.”",
        "“Take all the fruit ye want.”",
        "“An’ potatoes?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“An’ aigs?”",
        "“Well, if ye don’t take more’n ye need.”",
        "“An’ cakes out of the pantry? Indians do that.”",
        "“No; howld on now. That is a good place to draw the line. How are ye\ngoin’ to get yer staff down thayer? It’s purty heavy. Ye see thayer\nare yer beds an’ pots an’ pans, as well as food.”",
        "“We’ll have to take a wagon to the swamp and then carry them on our\nbacks on the blazed trail,” said Sam, and explained “our backs” by\npointing to Michel and Si at work in the yard.",
        "“The road goes as far as the creek,” suggested Yan; “let’s make a raft\nthere an’ take the lot in it down to the swimming-pond; that’d be real\nInjun.”",
        "“What’ll ye make the raft of?” asked Raften.",
        "“Cedar rails nailed together,” answered Sam.",
        "“No nails in mine,” objected Yan; “that isn’t Injun.”",
        "“An’ none o’ my cedar rails fur that. ’Pears to me it’d be less work\nan’ more Injun to pack the stuff on yer backs an’ no risk o’ wettin’\nthe beds.”",
        "So the raft was given up, and the stuff was duly carted to the creek’s\nside. Raften himself went with it. He was a good deal of a boy at\nheart and he was much in sympathy with the plan. His remarks showed\na mixture of interest, and doubt as to the wisdom of letting himself\ntake so much interest.",
        "“Hayre, load me up,” he said, much to the surprise of the boys, as\nthey came to the creek’s edge. His broad shoulders carried half of the\nload. The blazed trail was only two hundred yards long, and in two\ntrips the stuff was all dumped down in front of the teepee.",
        "Sam noted with amusement the unexpected enthusiasm of his father.\n“Say, Da, you’re just as bad as we are. I believe you’d like to join\nus.”",
        "“’Moinds me o’ airly days here,” was the reply, with a wistful note in\nhis voice. “Many a night me an’ Caleb Clark slep’ out this way on this\nvery crick when them fields was solid bush. Do ye know how to make a\nbed?”",
        "“Don’t know a thing,” and Sam winked at Yan. “Show us.”",
        "“I’ll show ye the rale thing. Where’s the axe?”",
        "“Haven’t any,” said Yan. “There’s a big tomahawk and a little\ntomahawk.”",
        "Raften grinned, took the big “tomahawk” and pointed to a small Balsam\nFir. “Now there’s a foine bed-tree.”",
        "“Why, that’s a fire-tree, too,” said Yan, as with two mighty strokes\nRaften sent it toppling down, then rapidly trimmed it of its flat\ngreen boughs. A few more strokes brought down a smooth young Ash and\ncut it into four pieces, two of them seven feet long and two of them\nfive feet. Next he cut a White Oak sapling and made four sharp pegs\neach two feet long.",
        "“Now, boys, whayer do you want yer bed?” then stopping at a thought\nhe added, “Maybe ye didn’t want me to help–want to do everything\nyerselves?”",
        "“Ugh, bully good squaw. Keep it up–wagh!” said his son and heir, as\nhe calmly sat on a log and wore his most “Injun brave” expression of\nhaughty approval.",
        "The father turned with an inquiring glance to Yan, who replied:",
        "“We’re mighty glad of your help. You see, we don’t know how. It seems\nto me that I read once the best place in the teepee is opposite the\ndoor and a little to one side. Let’s make it here.” So Raften placed\nthe four logs for the sides and ends of the bed and drove in the\nground the four stakes to hold them. Yan brought in several armfuls of\nbranches, and Raften proceeded to lay them like shingles, beginning at\nthe head-log of the bed and lapping them very much. It took all the\nfir boughs, but when all was done there was a solid mass of soft green\ntips a foot thick, all the butts being at the ground.",
        "“Thayer,” said Raften, “that’s an Injun feather bed an’ safe\nan’ warrum. Slapin’ on the ground’s terrible dangerous, but that’s all\nright. Now make your bed on that.” Sam and Yan did so, and when it was\nfinished Raften said: “Now, fetch that little canvas I told yer ma to\nput in; that’s to fasten to the poles for an inner tent over the bed.”",
        "Yan stood still and looked uncomfortable.",
        "“Say, Da, look at Yan. He’s got that tired look that he wears when the\nrules is broke.”",
        "“What’s wrong,” asked Raften.",
        "“Indians don’t have them that I ever heard of,” said Little Beaver.",
        "“Yan, did ye iver hear of a teepee linin’ or a dew-cloth?”",
        "“Yes,” was the answer, in surprise at the unexpected knowledge of the\nfarmer.",
        "“Do ye know what they’re like?”",
        "“No–at least–no–”",
        "“Well, I do; that’s what it’s like. That’s something I do know,\nfur I seen old Caleb use wan.”",
        "“Oh, I remember reading about it now, and they are like that, and it’s\non them that the Indians paint their records. Isn’t that bully,” as he\nsaw Raften add two long inner stakes which held the dew-cloth like a\ncanopy.",
        "“Say, Da, I never knew you and Caleb were hunting together. Thought ye\nwere jest natural born enemies.”",
        "“Humph!” grunted Raften. “We wuz chums oncet. Never had no fault to\nfind till we swapped horses.”",
        "“Sorry you ain’t now, ’cause he’s sure sharp in the woods.”",
        "“He shouldn’t a-tried to make an orphan out o’ you.”",
        "“Are you sure he done it?”",
        "“If ’twasn’t him I dunno who ’twas. Yan, fetch some of them pine knots\nthayer.”",
        "Yan went after the knots; it was some yards into the woods, and out\nthere he was surprised to see a tall man behind a tree. A second’s\nglance showed it to be Caleb. The Trapper laid one finger on his lips\nand shook his head. Yan nodded assent, gathered the knots, and went\nback to the camp, where Sam continued:",
        "“You skinned him out of his last cent, old Boyle says.”",
        "“An’ whoi not, when he throid to shkin me? Before that I was helpin’\nhim, an’ fwhat must he do but be ahfter swappin’ horses. He might as\nwell ast me to play poker and then squeal when I scooped the pile.\nNaybours is wan thing an’ swappin’ horses is another. All’s fair in\na horse trade, an’ friends didn’t orter swap horses widout they kin\nstand the shkinnin’. That’s a game by itself. Oi would ’a’ helped him\njest the same afther that swap an’ moore, fur he wuz good stuff, but\nhe must nades shoot at me that noight as I come home wit the wad, so\nav coorse–”",
        "“I wish ye had a Dog now,” said the farmer in the new tone of a new\nsubject; “tramps is a nuisance at all toimes, an’ a Dog is the best\nmed’cine for them. I don’t believe old Cap’d stay here; but maybe yer\nnear enough to the house so they won’t bother ye. An’ now I guess the\nPaleface will go back to the settlement. I promised ma that I’d see\nthat yer bed wuz all right, an’ if ye sleep warrum an’ dry an’ hev\nplenty to ate ye’ll take no harrum.”",
        "So he turned away, but as he was quitting the clearing he\nstopped,–the curious boyish interest was gone from his face, the\ngeniality from his voice–then in his usual stern tones of command:",
        "[Illustration: “If ye kill any Song-birds, I’ll use the rawhoide on\nye.\"]",
        "“Now, bhoys, ye kin shoot all the Woodchucks yer a mind ter, fur they\nare a nuisance in the field. Yer kin kill Hawks an’ Crows an’ Jays,\nfur they kill other birds, an’ Rabbits an’ Coons, fur they are fair\ngame; but I don’t want to hear of yer killin’ any Squirrels or\nChipmunks or Song-birds, an’ if ye do I’ll stop the hull thing an’\nbring ye back to wurruk, an’ use the rawhoide on tap o’ that.”",
