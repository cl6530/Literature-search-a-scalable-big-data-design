        "There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\nCatherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.\n’Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\nhungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of\nale.’ ’Very well,’ said she, ’it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time\ndrew nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she\nhad, and put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look\nbrown, and to crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork\nand turned it: then she said to herself, ’The steak is almost ready, I\nmay as well go to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the\nfire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale\ncask. The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At\nlast it popped into her head, ’The dog is not shut up–he may be\nrunning away with the steak; that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran\nfrom the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had got the steak in\nhis mouth, and was making off with it.",
        "Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\nfaster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ’It’s all gone, and\n“what can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned\nround; and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home\nleisurely to cool herself.",
        "Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not\nturned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the\nfloor till the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she\nsaw what had happened. ’My stars!’ said she, ’what shall I do to keep\nFrederick from seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a\nwhile; and at last remembered that there was a sack of fine meal\nbought at the last fair, and that if she sprinkled this over the floor\nit would suck up the ale nicely. ’What a lucky thing,’ said she, ’that\nwe kept that meal! we have now a good use for it.’ So away she went\nfor it: but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of\nbeer, and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set\nswimming on the floor also. ’Ah! well,’ said she, ’when one goes\nanother may as well follow.’ Then she strewed the meal all about the\ncellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said, ’How very\nneat and clean it looks!’",
        "At noon Frederick came home. ’Now, wife,’ cried he, ’what have you for\ndinner?’ ’O Frederick!’ answered she, ’I was cooking you a steak; but\nwhile I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while\nI ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale\nwith the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but\nthe cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ’Kate, Kate,’ said\nhe, ’how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry,\nand the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ’Why, Frederick,’\nsaid she, ’I did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me\nbefore.’",
        "The husband thought to himself, ’If my wife manages matters thus, I\nmust look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house:\nso he said to Catherine, ’What pretty yellow buttons these are! I\nshall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care\nthat you never go near or meddle with them.’ ’No, Frederick,’ said\nshe, ’that I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some\npedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether\nshe would buy. ’Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have\nno money: if you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with\nyou.’ ’Yellow buttons!’ said they: ’let us have a look at them.’ ’Go\ninto the garden and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow\nbuttons: I dare not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they\nfound what these yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and\nleft her plenty of plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the\nhouse for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ’Kate,\nwhat have you been doing?’ ’See,’ said she, ’I have bought all these\nwith your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars\nwent themselves and dug them up.’ ’Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ’what\na pretty piece of work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my\nmoney: how came you to do such a thing?’ ’Why,’ answered she, ’I did\nnot know there was any harm in it; you should have told me.’",
        "Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,\n’Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after\nthe thieves.’ ’Well, we will try,’ answered he; ’but take some butter\nand cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’\n’Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the\nfastest, he left his wife some way behind. ’It does not matter,’\nthought she: ’when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than\nhe.’",
        "Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there\nwas a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on\neach side as they passed. ’Ah, see now,’ said she, ’how they have\nbruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So\nshe took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all,\nso that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing\nthis kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled\ndown the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone;\nso she said, ’Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find\nyou; he has younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other\ncheese after it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill.\nBut she said she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow\nher, and she could not stay there all day waiting for them.",
        "At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something\nto eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ’Where are the butter and\ncheese?’ said he. ’Oh!’ answered she, ’I used the butter to grease\nthose poor trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran\naway so I sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are\nboth on the road together somewhere.’ ’What a goose you are to do such\nsilly things!’ said the husband. ’How can you say so?’ said she; ’I am\nsure you never told me not.’",
        "They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ’Kate, I hope you\nlocked the door safe when you came away.’ ’No,’ answered she, ’you did\nnot tell me.’ ’Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’\nsaid Frederick, ’and bring with you something to eat.’",
        "Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\n’Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond\nof butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the\nvinegar, for I have often seen him take some.’",
        "When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door\nshe took off the hinges, and said, ’Frederick told me to lock the\ndoor, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So\nshe took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she\ncried out, ’There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch\nit as carefully as you please.’ ’Alas! alas!’ said he, ’what a clever\nwife I have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door\naway, so that everybody may go in and out as they please–however, as\nyou have brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your\npains.’ ’Very well,’ answered she, ’I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not\ncarry the nuts and vinegar bottle also–that would be too much of a\nload; so if you please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’",
        "Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off\ninto the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them:\nand when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night\nthere. Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very\nrogues they were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and\nbelonged to that class of people who find things before they are lost;\nthey were tired; so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree\nwhere Frederick and Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the\nother side, and picked up some stones. Then he climbed up again, and\ntried to hit the thieves on the head with them: but they only said,\n’It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’",
        "Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;\nbut she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she\nsaid softly, ’Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ’No,’ answered he,\n’not now, they will discover us.’ ’I can’t help that: they must go.’\n’Well, then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away\nrattled the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried,\n’Bless me, it is hailing.’",
        "A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:\nso she whispered to Frederick, ’I must throw the vinegar down.’ ’Pray\ndon’t,’ answered he, ’it will discover us.’ ’I can’t help that,’ said\nshe, ’go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves\nsaid, ’What a heavy dew there is!’",
        "At last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself\nthat was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ’Frederick, I must\nthrow the door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so,\nfor he was sure it would betray them. ’Here goes, however,’ said she:\nand down went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they\ncried out ’Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast\nas they could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine\ncame down, there they found all their money safe and sound.",
