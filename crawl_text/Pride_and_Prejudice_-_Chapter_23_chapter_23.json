        "Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on\nwhat she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to\nmention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his\ndaughter, to announce her engagement to the family.  With many\ncompliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect\nof a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter–to\nan audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.\nBennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he\nmust be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\noften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:",
        "“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?  Do not\nyou know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”",
        "Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have\nborne without anger such treatment; but Sir William’s good\nbreeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave\nto be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened\nto all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.",
        "Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so\nunpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his\naccount, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte\nherself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her\nmother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to\nSir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by\nmaking a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be\nexpected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,\nand the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.",
        "Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great\ndeal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them\nthan her feelings found a rapid vent.  In the first place, she\npersisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she\nwas very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she\ntrusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,\nthat the match might be broken off.  Two inferences, however,\nwere plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was\nthe real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had\nbeen barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points\nshe principally dwelt during the rest of the day.  Nothing could\nconsole and nothing could appease her.  Nor did that day wear\nout her resentment.  A week elapsed before she could see\nElizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she\ncould speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude,\nand many months were gone before she could at all forgive their\ndaughter.",
        "Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,\nand such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most\nagreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that\nCharlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably\nsensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his\ndaughter!",
        "Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she\nsaid less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their\nhappiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as\nimprobable.  Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,\nfor Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no\nother way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.",
        "Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to\nretort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well\nmarried; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual\nto say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and\nill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness\naway.",
        "Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which\nkept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt\npersuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between\nthem again.  Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with\nfonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy\nshe was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose\nhappiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been\ngone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.",
        "Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was\ncounting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\nThe promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on\nTuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the\nsolemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth’s abode in the\nfamily might have prompted.  After discharging his conscience\non that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous\nexpressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of\ntheir amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it\nwas merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again\nat Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday\nfortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved\nhis marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,\nwhich he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his\namiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the\nhappiest of men.",
        "Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter\nof pleasure to Mrs. Bennet.  On the contrary, she was as much\ndisposed to complain of it as her husband.  It was very strange\nthat he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it\nwas also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.  She\nhated having visitors in the house while her health was so\nindifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.\nSuch were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way\nonly to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued absence.",
        "Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.\nDay after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of\nhim than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his\ncoming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which\nhighly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to\ncontradict as a most scandalous falsehood.",
        "Even Elizabeth began to fear–not that Bingley was indifferent–but\nthat his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\nUnwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane’s\nhappiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she\ncould not prevent its frequently occurring.  The united efforts of\nhis two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted\nby the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London\nmight be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.",
        "As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course,\nmore painful than Elizabeth’s, but whatever she felt she was\ndesirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,\ntherefore, the subject was never alluded to.  But as no such\ndelicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which\nshe did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival,\nor even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she\nwould think herself very ill used.  It needed all Jane’s steady\nmildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.",
        "Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but\nhis reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had\nbeen on his first introduction.  He was too happy, however, to\nneed much attention; and luckily for the others, the business\nof love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.\nThe chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he\nsometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an\napology for his absence before the family went to bed.",
        "Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.  The very\nmention of anything concerning the match threw her into an\nagony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of\nhearing it talked of.  The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to\nher.  As her successor in that house, she regarded her with\njealous abhorrence.  Whenever Charlotte came to see them,\nshe concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession;\nand whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was\nconvinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and\nresolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house,\nas soon as Mr. Bennet were dead.  She complained bitterly of\nall this to her husband.",
        "“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that\nCharlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I\nshould be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take\nher place in it!”",
        "“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.  Let us\nhope for better things.  Let us flatter ourselves that I may be\nthe survivor.”",
        "This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead\nof making any answer, she went on as before.",
        "“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.\nIf it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.”",
        "“What should not you mind?”",
        "“I should not mind anything at all.”",
        "“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\ninsensibility.”",
        "“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the\nentail.  How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an\nestate from one’s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all\nfor the sake of Mr. Collins too!  Why should he have it more\nthan anybody else?”",
        "“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.",
