        "\nThe Diction viewed as a whole is made up of the following parts: the\nLetter (or ultimate element), the Syllable, the Conjunction, the\nArticle, the Noun, the Verb, the Case, and the Speech. (1) The Letter\nis an indivisible sound of a particular kind, one that may become a\nfactor in an intelligible sound. Indivisible sounds are uttered by the\nbrutes also, but no one of these is a Letter in our sense of the term.\nThese elementary sounds are either vowels, semivowels, or mutes. A\nvowel is a Letter having an audible sound without the addition of\nanother Letter. A semivowel, one having an audible sound by the\naddition of another Letter; e.g. S and R. A mute, one having no sound\nat all by itself, but becoming audible by an addition, that of one of\nthe Letters which have a sound of some sort of their own; e.g. D and\nG. The Letters differ in various ways: as produced by different\nconformations or in different regions of the mouth; as aspirated, not\naspirated, or sometimes one and sometimes the other; as long, short,\nor of variable quantity; and further as having an acute.g.ave, or\nintermediate accent.",
        "The details of these matters we mubt leave to the metricians. (2) A\nSyllable is a nonsignificant composite sound, made up of a mute and a\nLetter having a sound (a vowel or semivowel); for GR, without an A, is\njust as much a Syllable as GRA, with an A. The various forms of the\nSyllable also belong to the theory of metre. (3) A Conjunction is (a)\na non-significant sound which, when one significant sound is formable\nout of several, neither hinders nor aids the union, and which, if the\nSpeech thus formed stands by itself (apart from other Speeches) must\nnot be inserted at the beginning of it; e.g. men, de, toi,\nde. Or (b) a non-significant sound capable of combining two or more\nsignificant sounds into one; e.g. amphi, peri, etc. (4) An\nArticle is a non-significant sound marking the beginning, end, or\ndividing-point of a Speech, its natural place being either at the\nextremities or in the middle. (5) A Noun or name is a composite\nsignificant sound not involving the idea of time, with parts which\nhave no significance by themselves in it. It is to be remembered that\nin a compound we do not think of the parts as having a significance\nalso by themselves; in the name ’Theodorus’, for instance, the doron\nmeans nothing to us.",
        "(6) A Verb is a composite significant sound involving the idea of\ntime, with parts which (just as in the Noun) have no significance by\nthemselves in it. Whereas the word ’man’ or ’white’ does not imply\nwhen, ’walks’ and ’has walked’ involve in addition to the idea of\nwalking that of time present or time past.",
        "(7) A Case of a Noun or Verb is when the word means ’of or ’to’ a\nthing, and so forth, or for one or many (e.g. ’man’ and ’men’); or it\nmay consist merely in the mode of utterance, e.g. in question,\ncommand, etc. ’Walked?’ and ’Walk!’ are Cases of the verb ’to walk’ of\nthis last kind. (8) A Speech is a composite significant sound, some of\nthe parts of which have a certain significance by themselves. It may\nbe observed that a Speech is not always made up of Noun and Verb; it\nmay be without a Verb, like the definition of man; but it will always\nhave some part with a certain significance by itself. In the Speech\n’Cleon walks’, ’Cleon’ is an instance of such a part. A Speech is said\nto be one in two ways, either as signifying one thing, or as a union\nof several Speeches made into one by conjunction. Thus the Iliad is\none Speech by conjunction of several; and the definition of man is one\nthrough its signifying one thing.",
