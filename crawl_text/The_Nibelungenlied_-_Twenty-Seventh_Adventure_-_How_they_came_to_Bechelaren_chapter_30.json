        "Then went forth the margrave / where two ladies sate,\nHis wife beside his daughter, / nor longer did he wait\nTo tell the joyful tidings / that unto him were brought,\nHow Kriemhild’s royal brothers / his hospitality had sought.",
        "1651",
        "“Dearly loved lady,\" / spake then Ruediger,\n“Full kind be thy reception / to lordly monarchs here,\nThat now with train of warriors / to court do pass this way.\nFair be eke thy greeting / to Hagen, Gunther’s man, this day.",
        "1652",
        "“One likewise with them cometh, / Dankwart by name,\nVolker hight the other, / a knight of gallant fame.\nThyself and eke thy daughter / with kiss these six shall greet;\nFull courteous be your manner / as ye the doughty thanes shall meet.”",
        "1653",
        "Gave straight their word the ladies, / and willing were thereto.\nFrom out great chests they gorgeous / attire in plenty drew,\nWhich they to meet the lofty / strangers thought to wear,\nMickle was the hurry / there of many a lady fair.",
        "1654",
        "On ne’er a cheek might any / but nature’s hue be seen.\nUpon their head they carried / band of golden sheen,\nThat was a beauteous chaplet, / that so their glossy hair\nBy wind might not be ruffled: / that is truth as I declare.",
        "1655",
        "At such employment busy / leave we those ladies now.\nHere with mickle hurry / across the plain did see\nFriends of noble Ruediger / the royal guests to meet,\nAnd them with warmest welcome / unto the margrave’s land did greet.",
        "1656",
        "When coming forth the margrave / saw their forms appear,\nHow spake with heart full joyous / the valiant Ruediger!\n“Welcome be ye, Sires, / and all your gallant band.\nRight glad am I to see you / hither come unto my land.”",
        "1657",
        "Then bent the knights before him / each full courteously.\nThat he good-will did bear them / might they full quickly see.\nHagen had special greeting, / who long to him was known;\nTo Volker eke of Burgundy / was like highest honor shown.",
        "1658",
        "Thus Dankwart eke he greeted, / when spake the doughty thane:\n“While we thus well are harbored, / who then for all the train\nOf those that follow with us / shall meet provision make?\"\n“Yourselves this night right easy / shall rest,” the noble margrave\n      spake.",
        "1659",
        "“And all that follow with you, / with equipment whatsoe’er\nYe bring into my country / of steed or warlike gear,\nSo sure shall it be guarded / that of all the sum,\nE’en to one spur’s value, / to you shall never damage come.",
        "1660",
        "“Now stretch aloft, my squires, / the tents upon the plain.\nWhat here ye have of losses / will I make good again.\nUnbridle now the horses / and let them wander free.\"\nUpon their way they seldom / did meet like hospitality.",
        "1661",
        "Thereat rejoiced the strangers. / When thus it ordered was,\nRode the high knights forward. / All round upon the grass\nLay the squires attendant / and found a gentle rest.\nI ween, upon their journey / was here provision costliest.",
        "1662",
        "Out before the castle / the noble margravine\nHad passed with her fair daughter. / In her train were seen\nA band of lovely women / and many a winsome maid,\nWhose arms with bracelets glittered, / and all in stately robes arrayed.",
        "1663",
        "The costly jewels sparkled / with far-piercing ray\nFrom out their richest vestments, / and buxom all were they.\nNow came the strangers thither / and sprang upon the ground.\nHow high in noble courtesy / the men of Burgundy were found!",
        "1664",
        "Six and thirty maidens / and many a fair lady,\n–Nor might ye ever any / more winsome wish to see–\nWent then forth to meet them / with many a knight full keen.\nAt hands of noble ladies / fairest greeting then was seen.",
        "1665",
        "The margrave’s youthful daughter / did kiss the kings all three\nAs eke had done her mother. / Hagen stood thereby.\nHer father bade her kiss him; / she looked the thane upon,\nWho filled her so with terror, / she fain had left the thing undone.",
        "1666",
        "When she at last must do it, / as did command her sire,\nMingled was her color, / both pale and hue of fire.\nLikewise kissed she Dankwart / and the Fiddler eke anon:\nThat he was knight of valor / to him was such high favor shown.",
        "1667",
        "The margrave’s youthful daughter / took then by the hand\nThe royal knight Giselher / of Burgundian land.\nE’en so led forth her mother / the gallant Gunther high.\nWith those guests so lofty / walked they there full joyfully.",
        "1668",
        "The host escorted Gernot / to a spacious hall and wide,\nWhere knights and stately ladies / sate them side by side.\nThen bade they for the strangers / pour good wine plenteously:\nIn sooth might never heroes / find fuller hospitality.",
        "1669",
        "Glances fond and many / saw ye directed there\nUpon Ruediger’s daughter, / for she was passing fair.\nYea, in his thoughts caressed her / full many a gallant knight;\nA lady high in spirit, / well might she every heart delight.",
        "1670",
        "Yet whatsoe’er their wishes, / might none fulfilled be.\nHither oft and thither / glanced they furtively\nOn maidens and fair ladies, / whereof were many there.\nRight kind the noble Fiddler / disposed was to Ruediger.",
        "1671",
        "They parted each from other / as ancient custom was,\nAnd knights and lofty ladies / did separating pass\nWhen tables were made ready / within the spacious hall.\nThere in stately manner / they waited on the strangers all.",
        "1672",
        "To do the guests high honor / likewise the table sought\nWith them the lofty margravine. / Her daughter led she not,\nBut left among the maidens, / where fitting was she sat.\nThat they might not behold her, grieved were the guests in sooth thereat.",
        "1673",
        "The drinking and the feasting, / when ’twas ended all,\nEscorted was the maiden / again into the hall.\nThen of merry jesting / they nothing lacked, I ween,\nWherein was busy Volker, / a thane full gallant and keen.",
        "1674",
        "Then spake the noble Fiddler / to all in lofty tone:\n“Great mercy, lordly margrave, / God to thee hath shown,\nFor that he hath granted / unto thee a wife\nOf so surpassing beauty, / and thereto a joyous life.",
        "1675",
        "“If that I were of royal / birth,” the Fiddler spake,\n“And kingly crown should carry, / to wife I’d wish to take\nThis thy lovely daughter, / –my heart thus prompteth me.\nA noble maid and gentle / and fair to look upon is she.”",
        "1676",
        "Then outspake the margrave: / “How might such thing be,\nThat king should e’er desire / daughter born to me?\nExiled from my country / here with my spouse I dwell:\nWhat avails the maiden, / be she favored ne’er so well?”",
        "1677",
        "Thereto gave answer Gernot, / a knight of manner kind:\n“If to my desire / I ever spouse would find,\nThen would I of such lady / right gladly make my choice.\"\nIn full kindly manner / added Hagen eke his voice:",
        "1678",
        "“Now shall my master Giselher / take to himself a spouse.\nThe noble margrave’s daughter / is of so lofty house,\nThat I and all his warriors / would glad her service own,\nIf that she in Burgundy / should ever wear a royal crown.”",
        "1679",
        "Glad thereat full truly / was Sir Ruediger,\nAnd eke Gotelinde: / they joyed such words to hear.\nAnon arranged the heroes / that her as bride did greet\nThe noble knight Giselher, / as was for any monarch meet.",
        "1680",
        "What thing is doomed to happen, / who may the same prevent?\nTo come to the assembly / they for the maidens sent,\nAnd to the knight they plighted / the winsome maid for wife,\nPledge eke by him was given, / his love should yet endure with life.",
        "1681",
        "They to the maid allotted / castles and spreading land,\nWhereof did give assurance / the noble monarch’s hand\nAnd eke the royal Gernot, / ’twould surely so be done.\nThen spake to them the margrave: / “Lordly castles have I none,",
        "1682",
        "“Yet true shall be my friendship / the while that I may live.\nUnto my daughter shall I / of gold and silver give\nWhat hundred sumpter-horses / full laden bear away,\nThat her husband’s lofty kinsmen / find honor in the fair array.”",
        "1683",
        "They bade the knight and maiden / within a ring to stand,\nAs was of old the custom. / Of youths a goodly band,\nThat all were merry-hearted, / did her there confront,\nAnd thought they on her beauty / as mind of youth is ever wont.",
        "1684",
        "When they began to question / then the winsome maid,\nWould she the knight for husband, / somewhat she was dismayed,\nAnd yet forego she would not / to have him for her own.\nShe blushed to hear the question, / as many another maid hath done.",
        "1685",
        "Her father Ruediger prompted / that Yes her answer be,\nAnd that she take him gladly. / Unto her instantly\nSprang the young Sir Giselher, / and in his arm so white\nHe clasped her to his bosom. / –Soon doomed to end was her delight.",
        "1686",
        "Then spake again the margrave: / “Ye royal knights and high,\nWhen that home ye journey / again to Burgundy\nI’ll give to you my daughter, / as fitting is to do,\nThat ye may take her with you.\" / They gave their plighted word thereto.",
        "1687",
        "What jubilation made they / yet at last must end.\nThe maiden then was bidden / unto her chamber wend,\nAnd guests to seek their couches / and rest until the day.\nFor them the host provided / a feast in hospitable way.",
        "1688",
        "When they had feasted fully / and to the Huns’ country\nThence would onward journey, / “Such thing shall never be,\"\nSpake the host full noble, / “but here ye still shall rest.\nSeldom hath my good fortune / welcomed yet so many a guest.”",
        "1689",
        "Thereto gave answer Dankwart: / “In sooth it may not be.\nBread and wine whence hast thou / and food sufficiently,\nOver night to harbor / of guests so great a train?\"\nWhen the host had heard it, / spake he: “All thy words are vain.",
        "1690",
        "“Refuse not my petition, / ye noble lords and high.\nA fortnight’s full provision / might I in sooth supply,\nFor you and every warrior / that journeys in your train.\nTill now hath royal Etzel / small portion of my substance ta’en.”",
        "1691",
        "Though fain they had declined it, / yet they there must stay\nE’en to the fourth morning. / Then did the host display\nSo generous hand and lavish / that it was told afar.\nHe gave unto the strangers / horses and apparel rare.",
        "1692",
        "The time at last was over / and they must journey thence.\nThen did the valiant Ruediger / with lavish hand dispense\nUnto all his bounty, / refused he unto none\nWhate’er he might desire. / Well-pleased they parted every one.",
        "1693",
        "His courteous retainers / to castle gateway brought\nSaddled many horses, / and soon the place was sought\nEke by the gallant strangers / each bearing shield in hand,\nFor that they thence would journey / onward into Etzel’s land.",
        "1694",
        "The host had freely offered / rich presents unto all,\nEre that the noble strangers / passed out before the hall.\nHigh in honor lived he, / a knight of bounty rare.\nHis fair daughter had he / given unto Giselher.",
        "1695",
        "Eke gave he unto Gunther, / a knight of high renown,\nWhat well might wear with honor / the monarch as his own,\n–Though seldom gift received he– / a coat of harness rare.\nThereat inclined King Gunther / before the noble Ruediger.",
        "1696",
        "Then gave he unto Gernot / a good and trusty blade,\nWherewith anon in combat / was direst havoc made.\nThat thus the gift was taken / rejoiced the margrave’s wife:\nThereby the noble Ruediger / was doomed anon to lose his life.",
        "1697",
        "Gotelinde proffered Hagen, / as ’twas a fitting thing,\nHer gifts in kindly manner. / Since scorned them not the king,\nEke he without her bounty / to the high festivity\nShould thence not onward journey. / Yet loath to take the same was he.",
        "1698",
        "“Of all doth meet my vision,\" / Hagen then spake,\n“Would I wish for nothing / with me hence to take\nBut alone the shield that hanging / on yonder wall I see.\nThe same I’d gladly carry / into Etzel’s land with me.”",
        "1699",
        "When the stately margravine / Hagen’s words did hear,\nBrought they to mind her sorrow, / nor might she stop a tear.\nShe thought again full sadly / how her son Nudung fell,\nSlain by hand of Wittich; / and did her breast with anguish swell.",
        "1700",
        "She spake unto the hero: / “The shield to thee I’ll give.\nO would to God in heaven / that he still did live,\nWhose hand erstwhile did wield it! / In battle fell he low,\nAnd I, a wretched mother, / must weep with never-ending woe.",
        "1701",
        "Thereat the noble lady / up from the settle rose,\nAnd soon her arms all snow-white / did the shield enclose.\nShe bore it unto Hagen, / who made obeisance low;\nThe gift she might with honor / upon so valiant thane bestow.",
        "1702",
        "O’er it, to keep its color, / a shining cover lay\nWith precious stones all studded, / nor ever shone the day\nUpon a shield more costly; / if e’er a longing eye\nDid covet to possess it, / scarce thousand marks the same might buy.",
        "1703",
        "The shield in charge gave Hagen / thence away to bear.\nBefore his host then Dankwart / himself presented there,\nOn whom the margrave’s daughter / did costly dress bestow.\nWherein anon in Hunland / arrayed full stately he did go.",
        "1704",
        "Whate’er of gifts by any / was accepted there,\nThem had his hand ne’er taken, / but that intent all were\nTo do their host an honor / who gave with hand so free.\nBy his guests in combat / soon doomed was he slain to be.",
        "1705",
        "Volker the valiant / to Gotelinde came\nAnd stood in courteous manner / with fiddle ’fore the dame.\nSweet melodies he played her / and sang his songs thereby,\nFor thought he from Bechelaren / to take departure presently.",
        "1706",
        "The margravine bade to her / a casket forth to bear.\nAnd now of presents given / full freely may ye hear.\nTherefrom she took twelve armbands / and drew them o’er his hand.\n“These shall thou with thee carry, / as ridest thou to Etzel’s land,",
        "1707",
        "“And for my sake shalt wear them / when at court thou dost appear,\nThat when thou hither comest / I may the story hear\nHow thou hast done me honor / at the high festival.\"\nWhat did wish the lady, / faithfully performed he all.",
        "1708",
        "Thus to his guests the host spake: / “That ye more safely fare,\nMyself will give you escort / and bid them well beware\nThat upon the highway / no ill on you be wrought.\"\nThereat his sumpter horses / straightway laden forth were brought",
        "1709",
        "The host was well prepared / with five hundred men\nWith horse and rich attire. / These led he with him then\nIn right joyous humor / to the high festival.\nAlive to Bechelaren / again came never one of all.",
        "1710",
        "Thence took his leave Sir Ruediger / with kiss full lovingly;\nAs fitting was for Giselher, / likewise the same did he.\nWith loving arms enfolding / caressed they ladies fair.\nTo many a maid the parting / did bring anon full bitter tear.",
        "1711",
        "On all sides then the windows / were open wide flung,\nAs with his train of warriors / the host to saddle sprung.\nI ween their hearts did tell them / how they should sorrow deep.\nFor there did many a lady / and many a winsome maiden weep.",
        "1712",
        "For dear friends left behind him / grieved many a knight full sore.\nWhom they at Bechelaren / should behold no more.\nYet rode they off rejoicing / down across the sand\nHard by the Danube river / on their way to Etzel’s land.",
        "1713",
        "Then spake to the Burgundians / the gallant knight and bold,\nRuediger the noble: / “Now let us not withhold\nThe story of our coming / unto the Hun’s country.\nUnto the royal Etzel / might tidings ne’er more welcome be.”",
        "1714",
        "Down in haste through Austria / the messenger did ride,\nWho told unto the people / soon on every side,\nFrom Worms beyond Rhine river / were high guests journeying.\nNor unto Etzel’s people / gladder tidings might ye bring.",
        "1715",
        "Onward spurred the messengers / who did the message bear,\nHow now in Hunnish country / the Nibelungen were.\n“Kriemhild, lofty lady, / warm thy welcome be;\nIn stately manner hither / come thy loving brothers three.”",
        "1716",
        "Within a lofty casement / the Lady Kriemhild stood,\nLooking for her kinsmen, / as friend for friend full good.\nFrom her father’s country / saw she many a knight;\nEke heard the king the tidings, / and laughed thereat for sheer delight.",
        "1717",
        "“Now well my heart rejoiceth,\" / spake Lady Kriemhild.\n“Hither come my kinsmen / with many a new-wrought shield\nAnd brightly shining hauberk: / who gold would have from me,\nBe mindful of my sorrow; / to him I’ll ever gracious be.”",
