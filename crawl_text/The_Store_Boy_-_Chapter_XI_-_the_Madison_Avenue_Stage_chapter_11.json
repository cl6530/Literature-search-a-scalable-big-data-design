        "Ben was naturally hopeful, but he had counted more than he was aware\non the chance of obtaining assistance from Absalom Peters toward\npaying off his mother’s mortgage.  As Mr. Peters was in Europe nothing\ncould be done, and them seemed absolutely no one else to apply to.\nThey had friends, of course, and warm ones, in Pentonville, but none\nthat were able to help them.",
        "“I suppose we must make up our minds to lose the house,” thought Ben.\n“Squire Davenport is selfish and grasping, and there is little chance\nof turning him.”",
        "He walked westward till he reached Madison Avenue.  A stage\napproached, being bound downtown, and, feeling tired, he got in.  The\nfare was but five cents, and he was willing to pay it.",
        "Some half dozen other passengers beside himself were in the stage.\nOpposite Ben sat a handsomely dressed, somewhat portly lady, of middle\nage, with a kindly expression.  Next her sat a young man, attired\nfashionably, who had the appearance of belonging to a family of\nposition.  There were, besides, an elderly man, of clerical\nappearance; a nurse with a small child, a business man, intent upon\nthe financial column of a leading paper, and a schoolboy.",
        "Ben regarded his fellow-passengers with interest.  In Pentonville he\nseldom saw a new face.  Here all were new.  Our young hero was, though\nbe did not know it, an embryo student of human nature.  He liked to\nobserve men and women of different classes and speculate upon their\nprobable position and traits.  It so happened that his special\nattention was attracted to the fashionably-attired young man.",
        "“I suppose he belongs to a rich family, and has plenty of money,\"\nthought Ben.  “It must be pleasant to be born with a gold spoon in\nyour mouth, and know that you are provided for life.”",
        "If Ben had been wiser he would have judged differently.  To be born to\nwealth removes all the incentives to action, and checks the spirit of\nenterprise.  A boy or man who finds himself gradually rising in the\nworld, through his own exertions, experiences a satisfaction unknown\nto one whose fortune is ready-made.  However, in Ben’s present strait\nit is no wonder he regarded with envy the supposed young man of\nfortune.",
        "Our hero was destined to be strangely surprised.  His eyes were\nunusually keen, and enabled him after a while to observe some rather\nremarkable movements on the part of the young man.  Though his eyes\nwere looking elsewhere, Ben could see that his right hand was\nstealthily insinuating itself into the pocket of the richly-dressed\nlady at his side.",
        "“Is it possible that he is a pickpocket?” thought Ben, in amazement.\n“So nicely dressed as he is, too!”",
        "It did not occur to Ben that he dressed well the better to avert\nsuspicion from his real character.  Besides, a man who lives at other\npeople’s expense can afford to dress well.",
        "“What shall I do?” thought Ben, disturbed in mind.  “Ought I not to\nwarn the lady that she is in danger of losing her money?”",
        "While he was hesitating the deed was accomplished.  A pearl\nportemonnaie was adroitly drawn from the lady’s pocket and transferred\nto that of the young man.  It was done with incredible swiftness, but\nBen’s sharp eyes saw it.",
        "The young man yawned, and, turning away from the lady, appeared to be\nlooking out of a window at the head of the coach.",
        "“Why, there is Jack Osborne,” he said, half audibly, and, rising,\npulled the strap for the driver to stop the stage.",
        "Then was the critical moment for Ben.  Was he to allow the thief to\nescape with the money.  Ben hated to get into a disturbance, but he\nfelt that it would be wrong and cowardly to be silent.",
        "“Before you get out,” he said, “hand that lady her pocketbook.”",
        "The face of the pickpocket changed and he darted a malignant glance at\nBen.",
        "“What do you mean, you young scoundrel?” he said.",
        "“You have taken that lady’s pocketbook,” persisted Ben.",
        "“Do you mean to insult me?”",
        "“I saw you do it.”",
        "With a half exclamation of anger, the young man darted to the door.\nBut he was brought to a standstill by the business man, who placed\nhimself in his way.",
        "“Not so fast, young man,” he said resolutely.",
        "“Out of the way!” exclaimed the thief, in a rage.  “It’s all a base\nlie.  I never was so insulted in my life.”",
        "“Do you miss your pocketbook, madam?” asked the gentleman, turning to\nthe lady who had been robbed.",
        "“Yes,” she answered.  “It was in the pocket next to this man.”",
        "The thief seeing there was no hope of retaining his booty, drew it\nfrom his pocket and flung it into the lady’s lap.",
        "“Now, may I go?” he said.",
        "There was no policeman in sight, and at a nod from the lady, the\npickpocket was allowed to leave the stage.",
        "“You ought to have had him arrested.  He is a dangerous character,\"\nsaid the gentleman who had barred his progress.",
        "“It would have been inconvenient for me to appear against him,” said\nthe lady.  “I am willing to let him go.”",
        "“Well, there is one comfort–if he keeps on he will be hauled up\nsooner or later,” remarked the gentleman.  “Would your loss have been\na heavy one?” he inquired.",
        "“I had quite a large sum in my pocketbook, over two hundred dollars.\nBut for my young friend opposite,” she said, nodding kindly at Ben, “I\nshould have lost it with very small chance of recovery.”",
        "“I am glad to have done you a service, madam,” said Ben politely.",
        "“I know it is rather imprudent to carry so large sum about with me,\"\ncontinued the lady, but I have a payment to make to a carpenter who\nhas done work in my house, and I thought he might not find it\nconvenient use a check.”",
        "“A lady is in more danger than a gentleman,” observed the business\nman, “as she cannot so well hide away her pocketbook.  You will need\nto be careful as you walk along the street.”",
        "“I think it will be best to have a neighbor whom I can trust,” said\nthe lady.  “Would you mind taking this seat at my side?” she\ncontinued, addressing Ben.",
        "“I will change with pleasure,” said our hero, taking the seat recently\nvacated by the pickpocket.",
        "“You have sharp eyes, my young friend,” said his new acquaintance.",
        "“My eyes are pretty good,” said Ben, with a smile.",
        "“They have done me good service to-day.  May I know to whom I am\nindebted for such timely help?”",
        "“My name is Benjamin Barclay.”",
        "“Do you live in the city?”",
        "“No, madam.  I live in Pentonville, about thirty miles from New York.”",
        "“I have heard of the place.  Are you proposing to live here?”",
        "“No madam.  I came in to-day on a little business of my own, and also\nto select some goods for a country store in which I am employed.”",
        "“You are rather young for such a commission.”",
        "“I know the sort of goods Mr. Crawford sells, so it was not very\ndifficult to make the selection.”",
        "“At what time do you go back?”",
        "“By the four o’clock train.”",
        "“Have you anything to do meanwhile?”",
        "“No, madam,” answered Ben, a little surprised.",
        "“Then I should like to have you accompany me to the place where I am\nto settle my bill.  I feel rather timid after my adventure with our\nlate fellow-passenger.”",
        "“I shall be very happy to oblige you, madam,” said Ben politely.",
        "He had just heard a public clock strike one and he knew, therefore,\nthat he would have plenty of time.",
