        "\nMarie Antoinette a la Rose (detail)\nby Elizabeth Vigee Lebrun\n",
        "\n\n",
        "There are four women who may be said to have deeply influenced the\nlife of Napoleon. These four are the only ones who need to be\ntaken into account by the student of his imperial career. The\ngreat emperor was susceptible to feminine charms at all times; but\njust as it used to be said of him that “his smile never rose above\nhis eyes,” so it might as truly be said that in most instances the\nthrobbing of his heart did not affect his actions.",
        "Women to him were the creatures of the moment, although he might\nseem to care for them and to show his affection in extravagant\nways, as in his affair with Mlle. Georges, the beautiful but\nrather tiresome actress. As for Mme. de Stael, she bored him to\ndistraction by her assumption of wisdom. That was not the kind of\nwoman that Napoleon cared for. He preferred that a woman should be\nwomanly, and not a sort of owl to sit and talk with him about the\ntheory of government.",
        "When it came to married women they interested him only because of\nthe children they might bear to grow up as recruits for his\ninsatiate armies. At the public balls given at the Tuileries he\nwould walk about the gorgeous drawing-rooms, and when a lady was\npresented to him he would snap out, sharply:",
        "“How many children have you?”",
        "If she were able to answer that she had several the emperor would\nlook pleased and would pay her some compliment; but if she said\nthat she had none he would turn upon her sharply and say:",
        "“Then go home and have some!”",
        "Of the four women who influenced his life, first must come\nJosephine, because she secured him his earliest chance of\nadvancement. She met him through Barras, with whom she was said to\nbe rather intimate. The young soldier was fascinated by her–the\nmore because she was older than he and possessed all the practised\narts of the creole and the woman of the world. When she married\nhim she brought him as her dowry the command of the army of Italy,\nwhere in a few months he made the tri-color, borne by ragged\ntroops, triumphant over the splendidly equipped hosts of Austria.",
        "She was his first love, and his knowledge of her perfidy gave him\nthe greatest shock and horror of his whole life; yet she might\nhave held him to the end if she had borne an heir to the imperial\nthrone. It was her failure to do so that led Napoleon to divorce\nJosephine and marry the thick-lipped Marie Louise of Austria.\nThere were times later when he showed signs of regret and said:",
        "“I have had no luck since I gave up Josephine!”",
        "Marie Louise was of importance for a time–the short time when\nshe entertained her husband and delighted him by giving birth to\nthe little King of Rome. Yet in the end she was but an episode;\nfleeing from her husband in his misfortune, becoming the mistress\nof Count Neipperg, and letting her son–l’Aiglon–die in a land\nthat was far from France.",
        "Napoleon’s sister, Pauline Bonaparte, was the third woman who\ncomes to mind when we contemplate the great Corsican’s career.\nShe, too, is an episode. During the period of his ascendancy she\nplagued him with her wanton ways, her sauciness and trickery. It\nwas amusing to throw him into one of his violent rages; but\nPauline was true at heart, and when her great brother was sent to\nElba she followed him devotedly and gave him all her store of\njewels, including the famous Borghese diamonds, perhaps the most\nsuperb of all gems known to the western world. She would gladly\nhave followed him, also, to St. Helena had she been permitted.\nRemaining behind, she did everything possible in conspiring to\nsecure his freedom.",
        "But, after all, Pauline and Marie Louise count for comparatively\nlittle. Josephine’s fate was interwoven with Napoleon’s; and, with\nhis Corsican superstition, he often said so. The fourth woman, of\nwhom I am writing here, may be said to have almost equaled\nJosephine in her influence on the emperor as well as in the pathos\nof her life-story.",
        "On New-Year’s Day of 1807 Napoleon, who was then almost Emperor of\nEurope, passed through the little town of Bronia, in Poland.\nRiding with his cavalry to Warsaw, the ancient capital of the\nPolish kingdom, he seemed a very demigod of battle.",
        "True, he had had to abandon his long-cherished design of invading\nand overrunning England, and Nelson had shattered his fleets and\npractically driven his flag from the sea; but the naval disaster\nof Trafalgar had speedily been followed by the triumph of\nAusterlitz, the greatest and most brilliant of all Napoleon’s\nvictories, which left Austria and Russia humbled to the very\nground before him.",
        "Then Prussia had dared to defy the over-bearing conqueror and had\nput into the field against him her armies trained by Frederick the\nGreat; but these he had shattered almost at a stroke, winning in\none day the decisive battles of Jena and Auerstadt. He had stabled\nhis horses in the royal palace of the Hohenzollerns and had\npursued the remnant of the Prussian forces to the Russian border.",
        "As he marched into the Polish provinces the people swarmed by\nthousands to meet him and hail him as their country’s savior. They\nbelieved down to the very last that Bonaparte would make the Poles\nonce more a free and independent nation and rescue them from the\ntyranny of Russia.",
        "Napoleon played upon this feeling in every manner known to his\nartful mind. He used it to alarm the Czar. He used it to\nintimidate the Emperor of Austria; but more especially did he use\nit among the Poles themselves to win for his armies thousands upon\nthousands of gallant soldiers, who believed that in fighting for\nNapoleon they were fighting for the final independence of their\nnative land.",
        "Therefore, with the intensity of patriotism which is a passion\namong the Poles, every man and every woman gazed at Napoleon with\nsomething like adoration; for was not he the mighty warrior who\nhad in his gift what all desired? Soldiers of every rank swarmed\nto his standards. Princes and nobles flocked about him. Those who\nstayed at home repeated wonderful stories of his victories and\nprayed for him and fed the flame which spread through all the\ncountry. It was felt that no sacrifice was too great to win his\nfavor; that to him, as to a deity, everything that he desired\nshould be yielded up, since he was to restore the liberty of\nPoland.",
        "And hence, when the carriage of the emperor dashed into Bronia,\nsurrounded by Polish lancers and French cuirassiers, the enormous\ncrowd surged forward and blocked the way so that their hero could\nnot pass because of their cheers and cries and supplications.",
        "In the midst of it all there came a voice of peculiar sweetness\nfrom the thickest portion of the crowd.",
        "“Please let me pass!” said the voice. “Let me see him, if only for\na moment!”",
        "The populace rolled backward, and through the lane which they made\na beautiful girl with dark blue eyes that flamed and streaming\nhair that had become loosened about her radiant face was\nconfronting the emperor. Carried away by her enthusiasm, she\ncried:",
        "“Thrice welcome to Poland! We can do or say nothing to express our\njoy in the country which you will surely deliver from its tyrant.”",
        "The emperor bowed and, with a smile, handed a great bouquet of\nroses to the girl, for her beauty and her enthusiasm had made a\ndeep impression on him.",
        "“Take it,” said he, “as a proof of my admiration. I trust that I\nmay have the pleasure of meeting you at Warsaw and of hearing your\nthanks from those beautiful lips.”",
        "In a moment more the trumpets rang out shrilly, the horsemen\nclosed up beside the imperial carriage, and it rolled away amid\nthe tumultuous shouting of the populace.",
        "The girl who had so attracted Napoleon’s attention was Marie\nWalewska, descended from an ancient though impoverished family in\nPoland. When she was only fifteen she was courted by one of the\nwealthiest men in Poland, the Count Walewska. He was three or four\ntimes her age, yet her dark blue eyes, her massive golden hair,\nand the exquisite grace of her figure led him to plead that she\nmight become his wife. She had accepted him, but the marriage was\nthat of a mere child, and her interest still centered upon her\ncountry and took the form of patriotism rather than that of\nwifehood and maternity.",
        "It was for this reason that the young Countess had visited Bronia.\nShe was now eighteen years of age and still had the sort of\nromantic feeling which led her to think that she would keep in\nsome secret hiding-place the bouquet which the greatest man alive\nhad given her.",
        "But Napoleon was not the sort of man to forget anything that had\ngiven him either pleasure or the reverse. He who, at the height of\nhis cares, could recall instantly how many cannon were in each\nseaport of France and could make out an accurate list of all his\nmilitary stores; he who could call by name every soldier in his\nguard, with a full remembrance of the battles each man had fought\nin and the honors that he had won–he was not likely to forget so\nlovely a face as the one which had gleamed with peculiar radiance\nthrough the crowd at Bronia.",
        "On reaching Warsaw he asked one or two well-informed persons about\nthis beautiful stranger. Only a few hours had passed before Prince\nPoniatowski, accompanied by other nobles, called upon her at her\nhome.",
        "“I am directed, madam,” said he, “by order of the Emperor of\nFrance, to bid you to be present at a ball that is to be given in\nhis honor to-morrow evening.”",
        "Mme. Walewska was startled, and her face grew hot with blushes.\nDid the emperor remember her escapade at Bronia? If so, how had he\ndiscovered her? Why should he seek her out and do her such an\nhonor?",
        "“That, madam, is his imperial majesty’s affair,” Poniatowski told\nher. “I merely obey his instructions and ask your presence at the\nball. Perhaps Heaven has marked you out to be the means of saving\nour unhappy country.”",
        "In this way, by playing on her patriotism, Poniatowski almost\npersuaded her, and yet something held her back. She trembled,\nthough she was greatly fascinated; and finally she refused to go.",
        "Scarcely had the envoy left her, however, when a great company of\nnobles entered in groups and begged her to humor the emperor.\nFinally her own husband joined in their entreaties and actually\ncommanded her to go; so at last she was compelled to yield.",
        "It was by no means the frank and radiant girl who was now\npreparing again to meet the emperor. She knew not why, and yet her\nheart was full of trepidation and nervous fright, the cause of\nwhich she could not guess, yet which made her task a severe\nordeal. She dressed herself in white satin, with no adornment save\na wreath of foliage in her hair.",
        "As she entered the ballroom she was welcomed by hundreds whom she\nhad never seen before, but who were of the highest nobility of\nPoland. Murmurs of admiration followed her, and finally\nPoniatowski came to her and complimented her, besides bringing her\na message that the emperor desired her to dance with him.",
        "“I am very sorry,” she said, with a quiver of the lips, “but I\nreally cannot dance. Be kind enough to ask the emperor to excuse\nme.”",
        "But at that very moment she felt some strange magnetic influence;\nand without looking up she could feel that Napoleon himself was\nstanding by her as she sat with blanched face and downcast eyes,\nnot daring to look up at him.",
        "“White upon white is a mistake, madam,” said the emperor, in his\ngentlest tones. Then, stooping low, he whispered, “I had expected\na far different reception.”",
        "She neither smiled nor met his eyes. He stood there for a moment\nand then passed on, leaving her to return to her home with a heavy\nheart. The young countess felt that she had acted wrongly, and yet\nthere was an instinct–an instinct that she could not conquer.",
        "In the gray of the morning, while she was still tossing\nfeverishly, her maid knocked at the door and brought her a hastily\nscribbled note. It ran as follows:",
        "I saw none but you, I admired none but you; I desire only you.\nAnswer at once, and calm the impatient ardor of–N.",
        "These passionate words burned from her eyes the veil that had\nhidden the truth from her. What before had been mere blind\ninstinct became an actual verity. Why had she at first rushed\nforth into the very streets to hail the possible deliverer of her\ncountry, and then why had she shrunk from him when he sought to\nhonor her! It was all clear enough now. This bedside missive meant\nthat he had intended her dishonor and that he had looked upon her\nsimply as a possible mistress.",
        "At once she crushed the note angrily in her hand.",
        "“There is no answer at all,” said she, bursting into bitter tears\nat the very thought that he should dare to treat her in this way.",
        "But on the following morning when she awoke her maid was standing\nbeside her with a second letter from Napoleon. She refused to open\nit and placed it in a packet with the first letter, and ordered\nthat both of them should be returned to the emperor.",
        "She shrank from speaking to her husband of what had happened, and\nthere was no one else in whom she dared confide. All through that\nday there came hundreds of visitors, either of princely rank or\nmen who had won fame by their gallantry and courage. They all\nbegged to see her, but to them all she sent one answer–that she\nwas ill and could see no one.",
        "After a time her husband burst into her room, and insisted that\nshe should see them.",
        "“Why,” exclaimed he, “you are insulting the greatest men and the\nnoblest women of Poland! More than that, there are some of the\nmost distinguished Frenchmen sitting at your doorstep, as it were.\nThere is Duroc, grand marshal of France, and in refusing to see\nhim you are insulting the great emperor on whom depends everything\nthat our country longs for. Napoleon has invited you to a state\ndinner and you have given him no answer whatever. I order you to\nrise at once and receive these ladies and gentlemen who have done\nyou so much honor!”",
        "She could not refuse. Presently she appeared in her drawing-room,\nwhere she was at once surrounded by an immense throng of her own\ncountrymen and countrywomen, who made no pretense of\nmisunderstanding the situation. To them, what was one woman’s\nhonor when compared with the freedom and independence of their\nnation? She was overwhelmed by arguments and entreaties. She was\neven accused of being disloyal to the cause of Poland if she\nrefused her consent.",
        "One of the strangest documents of that period was a letter sent to\nher and signed by the noblest men in Poland. It contained a\npowerful appeal to her patriotism. One remarkable passage even\nquotes the Bible to point out her line of duty. A portion of this\nletter ran as follows:",
        "Did Esther, think you, give herself to Ahasuerus out of the\nfulness of her love for him? So great was the terror with which he\ninspired her that she fainted at the sight of him. We may\ntherefore conclude that affection had but little to do with her\nresolve. She sacrificed her own inclinations to the salvation of\nher country, and that salvation it was her glory to achieve. May\nwe be enabled to say the same of you, to your glory and our own\nhappiness!",
        "After this letter came others from Napoleon himself, full of the\nmost humble pleading. It was not wholly distasteful thus to have\nthe conqueror of the world seek her out and offer her his\nadoration any more than it was distasteful to think that the\nrevival of her own nation depended on her single will. M. Frederic\nMasson, whose minute studies regarding everything relating to\nNapoleon have won him a seat in the French Academy, writes of\nMarie Walewska at this time: Every force was now brought into play\nagainst her. Her country, her friends, her religion, the Old and\nthe New Testaments, all urged her to yield; they all combined for\nthe ruin of a simple and inexperienced girl of eighteen who had no\nparents, whose husband even thrust her into temptation, and whose\nfriends thought that her downfall would be her glory.",
        "Amid all these powerful influences she consented to attend the\ndinner. To her gratification Napoleon treated her with distant\ncourtesy, and, in fact, with a certain coldness.",
        "“I heard that Mme. Walewska was indisposed. I trust that she has\nrecovered,” was all the greeting that he gave her when they met.",
        "Every one else with whom she spoke overwhelmed her with flattery\nand with continued urging; but the emperor himself for a time\nacted as if she had displeased him. This was consummate art; for\nas soon as she was relieved of her fears she began to regret that\nshe had thrown her power away.",
        "During the dinner she let her eyes wander to those of the emperor\nalmost in supplication. He, the subtlest of men, knew that he had\nwon. His marvelous eyes met hers and drew her attention to him as\nby an electric current; and when the ladies left the great dining-\nroom Napoleon sought her out and whispered in her ear a few words\nof ardent love.",
        "It was too little to alarm her seriously now. It was enough to\nmake her feel that magnetism which Napoleon knew so well how to\nevoke and exercise. Again every one crowded about her with\ncongratulations. Some said:",
        "“He never even saw any of US. His eyes were all for YOU! They\nflashed fire as he looked at you.”",
        "“You have conquered his heart,” others said, “and you can do what\nyou like with him. The salvation of Poland is in your hands.”",
        "The company broke up at an early hour, but Mme. Walewska was asked\nto remain. When she was alone General Duroc–one of the emperor’s\nfavorite officers and most trusted lieutenants–entered and placed\na letter from Napoleon in her lap. He tried to tell her as\ntactfully as possible how much harm she was doing by refusing the\nimperial request. She was deeply affected, and presently, when\nDuroc left her, she opened the letter which he had given her and\nread it. It was worded thus:",
        "There are times when all splendors become oppressive, as I feel\nbut too deeply at the present moment. How can I satisfy the\ndesires of a heart that yearns to cast itself at your feet, when\nits impulses are checked at every point by considerations of the\nhighest moment? Oh, if you would, you alone might overcome the\nobstacles that keep us apart. MY FRIEND DUROC WILL MAKE ALL EASY\nFOR YOU. Oh, come, come! Your every wish shall be gratified! Your\ncountry will be dearer to me when you take pity on my poor heart.\nN.",
        "Every chance of escape seemed to be closed. She had Napoleon’s own\nword that he would free Poland in return for her self-sacrifice.\nMoreover, her powers of resistance had been so weakened that, like\nmany women, she temporized. She decided that she would meet the\nemperor alone. She would tell him that she did not love him, and\nyet would plead with him to save her beloved country.",
        "As she sat there every tick of the clock stirred her to a new\nexcitement. At last there came a knock upon the door, a cloak was\nthrown about her from behind, a heavy veil was drooped about her\ngolden hair, and she was led, by whom she knew not, to the street,\nwhere a finely appointed carriage was waiting for her.",
        "No sooner had she entered it than she was driven rapidly through\nthe darkness to the beautifully carved entrance of a palace. Half\nled, half carried, she was taken up the steps to a door which was\neagerly opened by some one within. There were warmth and light and\ncolor and the scent of flowers as she was placed in a comfortable\narm-chair. Her wrappings were taken from her, the door was closed\nbehind her; and then, as she looked up, she found herself in the\npresence of Napoleon, who was kneeling at her feet and uttering\nsoothing words.",
        "Wisely, the emperor used no violence. He merely argued with her;\nhe told her over and over his love for her; and finally he\ndeclared that for her sake he would make Poland once again a\nstrong and splendid kingdom.",
        "Several hours passed. In the early morning, before daylight, there\ncame a knock at the door.",
        "“Already?” said Napoleon. “Well, my plaintive dove, go home and\nrest. You must not fear the eagle. In time you will come to love\nhim, and in all things you shall command him.”",
        "Then he led her to the door, but said that he would not open it\nunless she promised to see him the next day–a promise which she\ngave the more readily because he had treated her with such\nrespect.",
        "On the following morning her faithful maid came to her bedside\nwith a cluster of beautiful violets, a letter, and several\ndaintily made morocco cases. When these were opened there leaped\nout strings and necklaces of exquisite diamonds, blazing in the\nmorning sunlight. Mme. Walewska seized the jewels and flung them\nacross the room with an order that they should be taken back at\nonce to the imperial giver; but the letter, which was in the same\nromantic strain as the others, she retained.",
        "On that same evening there was another dinner, given to the\nemperor by the nobles, and Marie Walewska attended it, but of\ncourse without the diamonds, which she had returned. Nor did she\nwear the flowers which had accompanied the diamonds.",
        "When Napoleon met her he frowned upon her and made her tremble\nwith the cold glances that shot from his eyes of steel. He\nscarcely spoke to her throughout the meal, but those who sat\nbeside her were earnest in their pleading.",
        "Again she waited until the guests had gone away, and with a\nlighter heart, since she felt that she had nothing to fear. But\nwhen she met Napoleon in his private cabinet, alone, his mood was\nvery different from that which he had shown before. Instead of\ngentleness and consideration he was the Napoleon of camps, and not\nof courts. He greeted her bruskly.",
        "“I scarcely expected to see you again,” said he. “Why did you\nrefuse my diamonds and my flowers? Why did you avoid my eyes at\ndinner? Your coldness is an insult which I shall not brook.” Then\nhe raised his voice to that rasping, almost blood-curdling tone\nwhich even his hardiest soldiers dreaded: “I will have you know\nthat I mean to conquer you. You SHALL–yes, I repeat it, you\nSHALL love me! I have restored the name of your country. It owes\nits very existence to me.”",
        "Then he resorted to a trick which he had played years before in\ndealing with the Austrians at Campo Formio.",
        "“See this watch which I am holding in my hand. Just as I dash it\nto fragments before you, so will I shatter Poland if you drive me\nto desperation by rejecting my heart and refusing me your own.”",
        "As he spoke he hurled the watch against the opposite wall with\nterrific force, dashing it to pieces. In terror, Mme. Walewska\nfainted. When she resumed consciousness there was Napoleon wiping\naway her tears with the tenderness of a woman and with words of\nself-reproach.",
        "The long siege was over. Napoleon had conquered, and this girl of\neighteen gave herself up to his caresses and endearments, thinking\nthat, after all, her love of country was more than her own honor.",
        "Her husband, as a matter of form, put her away from him, though at\nheart he approved what she had done, while the Polish people\nregarded her as nothing less than a national heroine. To them she\nwas no minister to the vices of an emperor, but rather one who\nwould make him love Poland for her sake and restore its greatness.",
        "So far as concerned his love for her, it was, indeed, almost\nidolatry. He honored her in every way and spent all the time at\nhis disposal in her company. But his promise to restore Poland he\nnever kept, and gradually she found that he had never meant to\nkeep it.",
        "“I love your country,” he would say, “and I am willing to aid in\nthe attempt to uphold its rights, but my first duty is to France.\nI cannot shed French blood in a foreign cause.”",
        "By this time, however, Marie Walewska had learned to love Napoleon\nfor his own sake. She could not resist his ardor, which matched\nthe ardor of the Poles themselves. Moreover, it flattered her to\nsee the greatest soldier in the world a suppliant for her smiles.",
        "For some years she was Napoleon’s close companion, spending long\nhours with him and finally accompanying him to Paris. She was the\nmother of Napoleon’s only son who lived to manhood. This son, who\nbore the name of Alexandre Florian de Walewski, was born in Poland\nin 1810, and later was created a count and duke of the second\nFrench Empire. It may be said parenthetically that he was a man of\ngreat ability. Living down to 1868, he was made much of by\nNapoleon III., who placed him in high offices of state, which he\nfilled with distinction. In contrast with the Duc de Morny, who\nwas Napoleon’s illegitimate half-brother, Alexandre de Walewski\nstood out in brilliant contrast. He would have nothing to do with\nstock-jobbing and unseemly speculation.",
        "“I may be poor,” he said–though he was not poor–\"but at least I\nremember the glory of my father and what is due to his great\nname.”",
        "As for Mme. Walewska, she was loyal to the emperor, and lacked the\ngreed of many women whom he had made his favorites. Even at Elba,\nwhen he was in exile and disgrace, she visited him that she might\nendeavor to console him. She was his counselor and friend as well\nas his earnestly loved mate. When she died in Paris in 1817, while\nthe dethroned emperor was a prisoner at St. Helena, the word\n“Napoleon” was the last upon her lips.",
