        "I no longer remember where I stopped in my narrative: I only know\nit was two in the morning when I went to bed; and if you had been\nwith me, that I might have talked instead of writing to you, I\nshould, in all probability, have kept you up till daylight.",
        "I think I have not yet related what happened as we rode home from\nthe ball, nor have I time to tell you now. It was a most magnificent\nsunrise: the whole country was refreshed, and the rain fell drop\nby drop from the trees in the forest. Our companions were asleep.\nCharlotte asked me if I did not wish to sleep also, and begged of\nme not to make any ceremony on her account. Looking steadfastly\nat her, I answered, “As long as I see those eyes open, there is\nno fear of my falling asleep.” We both continued awake till we\nreached her door. The maid opened it softly, and assured her, in\nanswer to her inquiries, that her father and the children were\nwell, and still sleeping. I left her asking permission to visit\nher in the course of the day. She consented, and I went, and,\nsince that time, sun, moon, and stars may pursue their course: I\nknow not whether it is day or night; the whole world is nothing\nto me.",
