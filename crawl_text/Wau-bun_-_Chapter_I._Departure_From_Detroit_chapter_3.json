        "It was on a dark, rainy evening in the month of September, 1830, that we\nwent on board the steamer “Henry Clay,” to take passage for Green Bay.\nAll our friends in Detroit had congratulated us upon our good fortune in\nbeing spared the voyage in one of the little schooners which at this\ntime afforded the ordinary means of communication with the few and\ndistant settlements on Lakes Huron and Michigan.",
        "Each one had some experience to relate of his own or Of his friends’\nmischances in these precarious journeys–long detentions on the St.\nClair flats–furious head-winds off Thunder Bay, or interminable Calms\nat Mackinac or the Manitous. That which most enhanced our sense of\npeculiar good luck, was the true story of one of our relatives having\nleft Detroit in the month of June and reached Chicago in the September\nfollowing, having been actually three months in performing what is\nsometimes accomplished by even a sail-vessel in four days.",
        "But the certainty of encountering similar misadventures would have\nweighed little with me. I was now to visit, nay, more, to become a\nresident of that land which had, for long years, been to me a region of\nromance. Since the time when, as a child, my highest delight had been in\nthe letters of a dear relative, describing to me his home and mode of\nlife in the “Indian country,” and still later, in his felicitous\nnarration of a tour with General Cass, in 1820, to the sources of the\nMississippi–nay, even earlier, in the days when I stood at my teacher’s\nknee, and spelled out the long word Mich-i-li-mack-i-nac, that distant\nland, with its vast lakes, its boundless prairies, and its mighty\nforests, had possessed a wonderful charm for my imagination. Now I was\nto see it!–it was to be my home!",
        "Our ride to the quay, through the dark by-ways, in a cart, the only\nvehicle which at that day could navigate the muddy, unpaved streets of\nDetroit, was a theme for much merriment, and not less so, our descent of\nthe narrow, perpendicular stair-way by which we reached the little\napartment called the Ladies’ Cabin. We were highly delighted with the\naccommodations, which, by comparison, seemed the very climax of comfort\nand convenience; more especially as the occupants of the cabin\nconsisted, beside myself, of but a lady and two little girls.",
        "Nothing could exceed the pleasantness of our trip for the first\ntwenty-four hours. There were some officers, old friends, among the\npassengers. We had plenty of books. The gentlemen read aloud\noccasionally, admired the solitary magnificence of the scenery around\nus, the primeval woods, or the vast expanse of water unenlivened by a\nsingle sail, and then betook themselves to their cigar, or their game of\neuchre, to while away the hours.",
        "For a time the passage over Thunder Bay was delightful, but, alas! it\nwas not destined, in our favor, to belie its name. A storm came on, fast\nand furious–what was worse, it was of long duration. The pitching and\nrolling of the little boat, the closeness, and even the sea-sickness, we\nbore as became us. They were what we had expected, and were prepared\nfor. But a new feature of discomfort appeared, which almost upset our\nphilosophy.",
        "The rain, which fell in torrents, soon made its way through every seam\nand pore of deck or moulding. Down the stair-way, through the joints and\ncrevices, it came, saturating first the carpet, then the bedding, until,\nfinally, we were completely driven, “by stress of weather,” into the\nGentlemen’s Cabin. Way was made for us very gallantly, and every\nprovision resorted to for our comfort, and we were congratulating\nourselves on having found a haven in our distress, when, lo! the seams\nabove opened, and down upon our devoted heads poured such a flood, that\neven umbrellas were an insufficient protection. There was nothing left\nfor the ladies and children but to betake ourselves to the berths,\nwhich, in this apartment, fortunately remained dry; and here we\ncontinued ensconced the livelong day. Our dinner was served up to us on\nour pillows. The gentlemen chose the dryest spots, raised their\numbrellas, and sat under them, telling amusing anecdotes, and saying\nfunny things to cheer us, until the rain ceased, and at nine o’clock in\nthe evening we were gladdened by the intelligence that we had reached\nthe pier at Mackinac.",
        "We were received with the most affectionate cordiality by Mr. and Mrs.\nRobert Stuart, at whose hospitable mansion we had been for some days\nexpected.",
        "The repose and comfort of an asylum like this, can be best appreciated\nby those who have reached it after a tossing and drenching such as ours\nhad been. A bright, warm fire, and countenances beaming with kindest\ninterest, dispelled all sensations of fatigue or annoyance.",
        "After a season of pleasant conversation, the servants were assembled,\nthe chapter of God’s word was solemnly read, the hymn chanted, the\nprayer of praise and thanksgiving offered, and we were conducted to our\nplace of repose.",
        "It is not my purpose here to attempt a portrait of those noble friends\nwhom I thus met for the first time. To an abler pen than mine should be\nassigned the honor of writing the biography of Robert Stuart. All who\nhave enjoyed the happiness of his acquaintance, or, still more, a\nsojourn under his hospitable roof, will carry with them to their latest\nhour the impression of his noble bearing, his genial humor, his untiring\nbenevolence, his upright, uncompromising adherence to principle, his\nardent philanthropy, his noble disinterestedness. Irving in his\n“Astoria,” and Franchere in his “Narrative,” give many striking traits\nof his early character, together with events of his history of a\nthrilling and romantic interest, but both have left the most valuable\nportion unsaid, his after-life, namely, as a Christian gentleman.",
        "Of his beloved partner, who still survives him, mourning on her bereaved\nand solitary pilgrimage, yet cheered by the recollection of her long and\nuseful course as a “Mother in Israel,” we will say no more than to offer\nthe incense of loving hearts, and prayers for the best blessings from\nher Father in heaven.",
