        "Of the length and breadth of Wales, the nature of its soil, and the\nthree remaining tribes of Britons",
        "Cambria, which, by a corrupt and common term, though less proper,\nis in modern times called Wales, is about two hundred miles long\nand one hundred broad.  The length from Port Gordber (1) in\nAnglesey to Port Eskewin (2) in Monmouthshire is eight days’\njourney in extent; the breadth from Porth Mawr, (3) or the great\nPort of St. David’s, to Ryd-helic, (4) which in Latin means VADUM\nSALICIS, or the Ford of the Willow, and in English is called\nWillow-forde, is four days’ journey.  It is a country very strongly\ndefended by high mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers,\nand marshes; insomuch that from the time the Saxons took possession\nof the island the remnants of the Britons, retiring into these\nregions, could never be entirely subdued either by the English or\nby the Normans.  Those who inhabited the southern angle of the\nisland, which took its name from the chieftain Corinaeus, (5) made\nless resistance, as their country was more defenceless.  The third\ndivision of the Britons, who obtained a part of Britany in Gaul,\nwere transported thither, not after the defeat of their nation, but\nlong before, by king Maximus, and, in consequence of the hard and\ncontinued warfare which they underwent with him, were rewarded by\nthe royal munificence with those districts in France.",
