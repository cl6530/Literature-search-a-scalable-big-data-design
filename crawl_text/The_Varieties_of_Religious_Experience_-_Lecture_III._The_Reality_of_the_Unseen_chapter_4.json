        "Were one asked to characterize the life of religion in the\nbroadest and most general terms possible, one might say that it\nconsists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that\nour supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves\nthereto.  This belief and this adjustment are the religious\nattitude in the soul.  I wish during this hour to call your\nattention to some of the psychological peculiarities of such an\nattitude as this, or belief in an object which we cannot see. \nAll our attitudes, moral, practical, or emotional, as well as\nreligious, are due to the “objects” of our consciousness, the\nthings which we believe to exist, whether really or ideally,\nalong with ourselves.  Such objects may be present to our senses,\nor they may be present only to our thought.  In either case they\nelicit from us a REACTION; and the reaction due to things of\nthought is notoriously in many cases as strong as that due to\nsensible presences.  It may be even stronger.  The memory of an\ninsult may make us angrier than the insult did when we received\nit.  We are frequently more ashamed of our blunders afterwards\nthan we were at the moment of making them; and in general our\nwhole higher prudential and moral life is based on the fact that\nmaterial sensations actually present may have a weaker influence\non our action than ideas of remoter facts.",
        "The more concrete objects of most men’s religion, the deities\nwhom they worship, are known to them only in idea.  It has been\nvouchsafed, for example, to very few Christian believers to have\nhad a sensible vision of their Saviour; though enough appearances\nof this sort are on record, by way of miraculous exception, to\nmerit our attention later.  The whole force of the Christian\nreligion, therefore, so far as belief in the divine personages\ndetermines the prevalent attitude of the believer, is in general\nexerted by the instrumentality of pure ideas, of which nothing in\nthe individual’s past experience directly serves as a model.",
        "But in addition to these ideas of the more concrete religious\nobjects, religion is full of abstract objects which prove to have\nan equal power.  God’s attributes as such, his holiness, his\njustice, his mercy, his absoluteness, his infinity, his\nomniscience, his tri-unity, the various mysteries of the\nredemptive process, the operation of the sacraments, etc., have\nproved fertile wells of inspiring meditation for Christian\nbelievers.[21] We shall see later that the absence of definite\nsensible images is positively insisted on by the mystical\nauthorities in all religions as the sine qua non of a successful\norison, or contemplation of the higher divine truths. Such\ncontemplations are expected (and abundantly verify the\nexpectation, as we shall also see) to influence the believer’s\nsubsequent attitude very powerfully for good.",
        "[21] Example:  “I have had much comfort lately in meditating on\nthe passages which show the personality of the Holy Ghost, and\nhis distinctness from the Father and the Son.  It is a subject\nthat requires searching into to find out, but, when realized,\ngives one so much more true and lively a sense of the fullness of\nthe Godhead, and its work in us and to us, than when only\nthinking of the Spirit in its effect on us.”  Augustus Hare: \nMemorials, i. 244, Maria Hare to Lucy H. Hare.",
        "Immanuel Kant held a curious doctrine about such objects of\nbelief as God, the design of creation, the soul, its freedom, and\nthe life hereafter.  These things, he said, are properly not\nobjects of knowledge at all.  Our conceptions always require a\nsense-content to work with, and as the words soul,”  “God,\"\n“immortality,” cover no distinctive sense-content whatever, it\nfollows that theoretically speaking they are words devoid of any\nsignificance.  Yet strangely enough they have a definite meaning\nFOR OUR PRACTICE.  We can act AS IF there were a God; feel AS IF\nwe were free; consider Nature AS IF she were full of special\ndesigns; lay plans AS IF we were to be immortal; and we find then\nthat these words do make a genuine difference in our moral life. \nOur faith THAT these unintelligible objects actually exist proves\nthus to be a full equivalent in praktischer Hinsicht, as Kant\ncalls it, or from the point of view of our action, for a\nknowledge of WHAT they might be, in case we were permitted\npositively to conceive them.  So we have the strange phenomenon,\nas Kant assures us, of a mind believing with all its strength in\nthe real presence of a set of things of no one of which it can\nform any notion whatsoever.",
        "My object in thus recalling Kant’s doctrine to your mind is not\nto express any opinion as to the accuracy of this particularly\nuncouth part of his philosophy, but only to illustrate the\ncharacteristic of human nature which we are considering, by an\nexample so classical in its exaggeration.  The sentiment of\nreality can indeed attach itself so strongly to our object of\nbelief that our whole life is polarized through and through, so\nto speak, by its sense of the existence of the thing believed in,\nand yet that thing, for purpose of definite description, can\nhardly be said to be present to our mind at all.  It is as if a\nbar of iron, without touch or sight, with no representative\nfaculty whatever, might nevertheless be strongly endowed with an\ninner capacity for magnetic feeling; and as if, through the\nvarious arousals of its magnetism by magnets coming and going in\nits neighborhood, it might be consciously determined to different\nattitudes and tendencies. Such a bar of iron could never give you\nan outward description of the agencies that had the power of\nstirring it so strongly; yet of their presence, and of their\nsignificance for its life, it would be intensely aware through\nevery fibre of its being.",
        "It is not only the Ideas of pure Reason as Kant styled them, that\nhave this power of making us vitally feel presences that we are\nimpotent articulately to describe.  All sorts of higher\nabstractions bring with them the same kind of impalpable appeal. \nRemember those passages from Emerson which I read at my last\nlecture.  The whole universe of concrete objects, as we know\nthem, swims, not only for such a transcendentalist writer, but\nfor all of us, in a wider and higher universe of abstract ideas,\nthat lend it its significance.  As time, space, and the ether\nsoak through all things so (we feel) do abstract and essential\ngoodness, beauty, strength, significance, justice, soak through\nall things good, strong, significant, and just.",
        "Such ideas, and others equally abstract, form the background for\nall our facts, the fountain-head of all the possibilities we\nconceive of.  They give its “nature,” as we call it, to every\nspecial thing.  Everything we know is “what” it is by sharing in\nthe nature of one of these abstractions.  We can never look\ndirectly at them, for they are bodiless and featureless and\nfootless, but we grasp all other things by their means, and in\nhandling the real world we should be stricken with helplessness\nin just so far forth as we might lose these mental objects, these\nadjectives and adverbs and predicates and heads of classification\nand conception.",
        "This absolute determinability of our mind by abstractions is one\nof the cardinal facts in our human constitution. Polarizing and\nmagnetizing us as they do, we turn towards them and from them, we\nseek them, hold them, hate them, bless them, just as if they were\nso many concrete beings. And beings they are, beings as real in\nthe realm which they inhabit as the changing things of sense are\nin the realm of space.",
        "Plato gave so brilliant and impressive a defense of this common\nhuman feeling, that the doctrine of the reality of abstract\nobjects has been known as the platonic theory of ideas ever\nsince.  Abstract Beauty, for example, is for Plato a perfectly\ndefinite individual being, of which the intellect is aware as of\nsomething additional to all the perishing beauties of the earth. \n“The true order of going,” he says, in the often quoted passage\nin his “Banquet,” “is to use the beauties of earth as steps along\nwhich one mounts upwards for the sake of that other Beauty, going\nfrom one to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair\nforms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions,\nuntil from fair notions, he arrives at the notion of absolute\nBeauty, and at last knows what the essence of Beauty is.\"[22]  In\nour last lecture we had a glimpse of the way in which a\nplatonizing writer like Emerson may treat the abstract divineness\nof things, the moral structure of the universe, as a fact worthy\nof worship.  In those various churches without a God which to-day\nare spreading through the world under the name of ethical\nsocieties, we have a similar worship of the abstract divine, the\nmoral law believed in as an ultimate object.  “Science” in many\nminds is genuinely taking the place of a religion.  Where this is\nso, the scientist treats the “Laws of Nature” as objective facts\nto be revered.  A brilliant school of interpretation of Greek\nmythology would have it that in their origin the Greek gods were\nonly half-metaphoric personifications of those great spheres of\nabstract law and order into which the natural world falls\napart–the sky-sphere, the ocean-sphere, the earth-sphere, and\nthe like; just as even now we may speak of the smile of the\nmorning, the kiss of the breeze, or the bite of the cold, without\nreally meaning that these phenomena of nature actually wear a\nhuman face.[23]",
        "[22] Symposium, Jowett, 1871, i.  527.",
        "[23] Example:  “Nature is always so interesting, under whatever\naspect she shows herself, that when it rains, I seem to see a\nbeautiful woman weeping.  She appears the more beautiful, the\nmore afflicted she is.”   B. de St. Pierre.",
        "As regards the origin of the Greek gods, we need not at present\nseek an opinion.  But the whole array of our instances leads to a\nconclusion something like this:  It is as if there were in the\nhuman consciousness a sense of reality, a feeling of objective\npresence, a perception of what we may call “something there,\"\nmore deep and more general than any of the special and particular\n“senses” by which the current psychology supposes existent\nrealities to be originally revealed.  If this were so, we might\nsuppose the senses to waken our attitudes and conduct as they so\nhabitually do, by first exciting this sense of reality; but\nanything else, any idea, for example, that might similarly excite\nit, would have that same prerogative of appearing real which\nobjects of sense normally possess.  So far as religious\nconceptions were able to touch this reality-feeling, they would\nbe believed in in spite of criticism, even though they might be\nso vague and remote as to be almost unimaginable, even though\nthey might be such non-entities in point of WHATNESS, as Kant\nmakes the objects of his moral theology to be.",
        "The most curious proofs of the existence of such an\nundifferentiated sense of reality as this are found in\nexperiences of hallucination.  It often happens that an\nhallucination is imperfectly developed:  the person affected will\nfeel a “presence” in the room, definitely localized, facing in\none particular way, real in the most emphatic sense of the word,\noften coming suddenly, and as suddenly gone; and yet neither\nseen, heard, touched, nor cognized in any of the usual “sensible\"\nways.  Let me give you an example of this, before I pass to the\nobjects with whose presence religion is more peculiarly\nconcerned.",
        "An intimate friend of mine, one of the keenest intellects I know,\nhas had several experiences of this sort.  He writes as follows\nin response to my inquiries:–<59>",
        "“I have several times within the past few years felt the so-\ncalled ’consciousness of a presence.’  The experiences which I\nhave in mind are clearly distinguishable from another kind of\nexperience which I have had very frequently, and which I fancy\nmany persons would also call the ’consciousness of a presence.’\nBut the difference for me between the two sets of experience is\nas great as the difference between feeling a slight warmth\noriginating I know not where, and standing in the midst of a\nconflagration with all the ordinary senses alert.",
        "“It was about September, 1884, when I had the first experience.\nOn the previous night I had had, after getting into bed at my\nrooms in College, a vivid tactile hallucination of being grasped\nby the arm, which made me get up and search the room for an\nintruder; but the sense of presence properly so called came on\nthe next night.  After I had got into bed and blown out the\ncandle, I lay awake awhile thinking on the previous night’s\nexperience, when suddenly I FELT something come into the room and\nstay close to my bed.  It remained only a minute or two.  I did\nnot recognize it by any ordinary sense and yet there was a\nhorribly unpleasant ’sensation’ connected with it.  It stirred\nsomething more at the roots of my being than any ordinary\nperception.  The feeling had something of the quality of a very\nlarge tearing vital pain spreading chiefly over the chest, but\nwithin the organism–and yet the feeling was not PAIN so much as\nABHORRENCE.  At all events, something was present with me, and I\nknew its presence far more surely than I have ever known the\npresence of any fleshly living creature.  I was conscious of its\ndeparture as of its coming:  an almost instantaneously swift\ngoing through the door, and the ’horrible sensation’ disappeared.",
        "“On the third night when I retired my mind was absorbed in some\nlectures which I was preparing, and I was still absorbed in these\nwhen I became aware of the actual presence (though not of the\nCOMING) of the thing that was there the night before, and of the\n’horrible sensation.’ I then mentally concentrated all my effort\nto charge this ’thing,’ if it was evil to depart, if it was NOT\nevil, to tell me who or what it was, and if it could not explain\nitself, to go, and that I would compel it <60> to go.  It went\nas on the previous night, and my body quickly recovered its\nnormal state.",
        "“On two other occasions in my life I have had precisely the same\n’horrible sensation.’  Once it lasted a full quarter of an hour. \nIn all three instances the certainty that there in outward space\nthere stood SOMETHING was indescribably STRONGER than the\nordinary certainty of companionship when we are in the close\npresence of ordinary living people.  The something seemed close\nto me, and intensely more real than any ordinary perception.\nAlthough I felt it to be like unto myself so to speak, or finite,\nsmall, and distressful, as it were, I didn’t recognize it as any\nindividual being or person.”",
        "Of course such an experience as this does not connect itself with\nthe religious sphere.  Yet it may upon occasion do so; and the\nsame correspondent informs me that at more than one other\nconjuncture he had the sense of presence developed with equal\nintensity and abruptness, only then it was filled with a quality\nof joy.",
        "“There was not a mere consciousness of something there, but fused\nin the central happiness of it, a startling awareness of some\nineffable good.  Not vague either, not like the emotional effect\nof some poem, or scene, or blossom, of music, but the sure\nknowledge of the close presence of a sort of mighty person, and\nafter it went, the memory persisted as the one perception of\nreality.  Everything else might be a dream, but not that.”",
        "My friend, as it oddly happens, does not interpret these latter\nexperiences theistically, as signifying the presence of God.  But\nit would clearly not have been unnatural to interpret them as a\nrevelation of the deity’s existence.  When we reach the subject\nof mysticism, we shall have much more to say upon this head.",
        "Lest the oddity of these phenomena should disconcert you, I will\nventure to read you a couple of similar narratives, much shorter,\nmerely to show that we are dealing with a well-marked natural\nkind of fact.  In the first case, which I <61> take from the\nJournal of the Society for Psychical Research, the sense of\npresence developed in a few moments into a distinctly\nvisualized hallucination–but I leave that part of the story out.",
        "“I had read,” the narrator says, “some twenty minutes or so, was\nthoroughly absorbed in the book, my mind was perfectly quiet, and\nfor the time being my friends were quite forgotten, when suddenly\nwithout a moment’s warning my whole being seemed roused to the\nhighest state of tension or aliveness, and I was aware, with an\nintenseness not easily imagined by those who had never\nexperienced it, that another being or presence was not only in\nthe room, but quite close to me.  I put my book down, and\nalthough my excitement was great, I felt quite collected, and not\nconscious of any sense of fear.  Without changing my position,\nand looking straight at the fire, I knew somehow that my friend\nA. H. was standing at my left elbow but so far behind me as to be\nhidden by the armchair in which I was leaning back.  Moving my\neyes round slightly without otherwise changing my position, the\nlower portion of one leg became visible, and I instantly\nrecognized the gray-blue material of trousers he often wore, but\nthe stuff appeared semitransparent, reminding me of tobacco smoke\nin consistency,\"[24]– and hereupon the visual hallucination\ncame.",
        "[24] Journal of the S. P. R., February, 1895, p. 26.",
        "Another informant writes:–",
        "“Quite early in the night I was awakened. . . . I felt as if I\nhad been aroused intentionally, and at first thought some one was\nbreaking into the house. . . . I then turned on my side to go to\nsleep again, and immediately felt a consciousness of a presence\nin the room, and singular to state, it was not the consciousness\nof a live person, but of a spiritual presence.  This may provoke\na smile, but I can only tell you the facts as they occurred to\nme.  I do not know how to better describe my sensations than by\nsimply stating that I felt a consciousness of a spiritual\npresence. . . .  I felt also at the same time a strong feeling of\nsuperstitious dread, as if something strange and fearful were\nabout to happen.\"[25]",

        "Professor Flournoy of Geneva gives me the following testimony of\na friend of his, a lady, who has the gift of automatic or\ninvoluntary writing:–",
        "“Whenever I practice automatic writing, what makes me feel that\nit is not due to a subconscious self is the feeling I always have\nof a foreign presence, external to my body.  It is sometimes so\ndefinitely characterized that I could point to its exact\nposition.  This impression of presence is impossible to describe.\nIt varies in intensity and clearness according to the personality\nfrom whom the writing professes to come.  If it is some one whom\nI love, I feel it immediately, before any writing has come.  My\nheart seems to recognize it.”",
        "In an earlier book of mine I have cited at full length a curious\ncase of presence felt by a blind man.  The presence was that of\nthe figure of a gray-bearded man dressed in a pepper and salt\nsuit, squeezing himself under the crack of the door and moving\nacross the floor of the room towards a sofa.  The blind subject\nof this quasi-hallucination is an exceptionally intelligent\nreporter.  He is entirely without internal visual imagery and\ncannot represent light or colors to himself, and is positive that\nhis other senses, hearing, etc., were not involved in this false\nperception.  It seems to have been an abstract conception rather,\nwith the feelings of reality and spatial outwardness directly\nattached to it–in other words, a fully objectified and\nexteriorized IDEA.",
        "Such cases, taken along with others which would be too tedious\nfor quotation, seem sufficiently to prove the existence in our\nmental machinery of a sense of present reality more diffused and\ngeneral than that which our special senses yield.  For the\npsychologists the tracing of the organic seat of such a feeling\nwould form a pretty problem–nothing could be more natural than\nto connect it with the muscular sense, with the feeling that our\nmuscles were innervating themselves for action.  Whatsoever thus\ninnervated our activity, or “made our flesh creep\"–our senses\nare what do so oftenest–might then appear real and present, even\nthough it were but an abstract idea.  But with such vague\nconjectures we have no concern at present, for our interest lies\nwith the faculty rather than with its organic seat.",
        "Like all positive affections of consciousness, the sense of\nreality has its negative counterpart in the shape of a feeling of\nunreality by which persons may be haunted, and of which one\nsometimes hears complaint:–",
        "“When I reflect on the fact that I have made my appearance by\naccident upon a globe itself whirled through space as the sport\nof the catastrophes of the heavens,” says Madame Ackermann; “when\nI see myself surrounded by beings as ephemeral and\nincomprehensible as I am myself, and all excitedly pursuing pure\nchimeras, I experience a strange feeling of being in a dream.  It\nseems to me as if I have loved and suffered and that erelong I\nshall die, in a dream.  My last word will be, ’I have been\ndreaming.’\"[26]",
        "[26] Pensees d’un Solitaire, p. 66.",
        "In another lecture we shall see how in morbid melancholy this\nsense of the unreality of things may become a carking pain, and\neven lead to suicide.",
        "We may now lay it down as certain that in the distinctively\nreligious sphere of experience, many persons (how many we cannot\ntell) possess the objects of their belief, not in the form of\nmere conceptions which their intellect accepts as true, but\nrather in the form of quasi-sensible realities directly\napprehended.  As his sense of the real presence of these objects\nfluctuates, so the believer alternates between warmth and\ncoldness in his faith.  Other examples will bring this home to\none better than abstract description, so I proceed immediately to\ncite some.  The first example is a negative one, deploring the\nloss of the sense in question.  I have extracted it from an\naccount given me by a scientific man of my acquaintance, of his\nreligious life.  It seems to me to show clearly that the feeling\nof reality may be something more like a sensation than an\nintellectual operation properly so-called.",
        "“Between twenty and thirty I gradually became more and more\nagnostic and irreligious, yet I cannot say that I ever lost that\n’indefinite consciousness’ which Herbert Spencer describes so\nwell, of an Absolute Reality behind phenomena.  For me this\nReality was not the pure Unknowable of Spencer’s philosophy, for\nalthough I had ceased my childish prayers to God, and never\nprayed to IT in a formal manner, yet my more recent experience\nshows me to have been in a relation to IT which practically was\nthe same thing as prayer.  Whenever I had any trouble, especially\nwhen I had conflict with other people, either domestically or in\nthe way of business, or when I was depressed in spirits or\nanxious about affairs, I now recognize that I used to fall back\nfor support upon this curious relation I felt myself to be in to\nthis fundamental cosmical IT.  It was on my side, or I was on Its\nside, however you please to term it, in the particular trouble,\nand it always strengthened me and seemed to give me endless\nvitality to feel its underlying and supporting presence.  In\nfact, it was an unfailing fountain of living justice, truth, and\nstrength, to which I instinctively turned at times of weakness,\nand it always brought me out.  I know now that it was a personal\nrelation I was in to it, because of late years the power of\ncommunicating with it has left me, and I am conscious of a\nperfectly definite loss.  I used never to fail to find it when I\nturned to it.  Then came a set of years when sometimes I found\nit, and then again I would be wholly unable to make connection\nwith it.  I remember many occasions on which at night in bed, I\nwould be unable to get to sleep on account of worry.  I turned\nthis way and that in the darkness, and groped mentally for the\nfamiliar sense of that higher mind of my mind which had always\nseemed to be close at hand as it were, closing the passage, and\nyielding support, but there was no electric current.  A blank was\nthere instead of IT:  I couldn’t find anything.  Now, at the age\nof nearly fifty, my power of getting into connection with it has\nentirely left me; and I have to confess that a great help has\ngone out of my life.  Life has become curiously dead and <65>\nindifferent; and I can now see that my old experience was\nprobably exactly the same thing as the prayers of the orthodox,\nonly I did not call them by that name.  What I have spoken of as\n’It’ was practically not Spencer’s Unknowable, but just my own\ninstinctive and individual God, whom I relied upon for higher\nsympathy, but whom somehow I have lost.”",
        "Nothing is more common in the pages of religious biography than\nthe way in which seasons of lively and of difficult faith are\ndescribed as alternating.  Probably every religious person has\nthe recollection of particular crisis in which a directer vision\nof the truth, a direct perception, perhaps, of a living God’s\nexistence, swept in and overwhelmed the languor of the more\nordinary belief.  In James Russell Lowell’s correspondence there\nis a brief memorandum of an experience of this kind:–",
        "“I had a revelation last Friday evening.  I was at Mary’s, and\nhappening to say something of the presence of spirits (of whom, I\nsaid, I was often dimly aware), Mr. Putnam entered into an\nargument with me on spiritual matters.  As I was speaking, the\nwhole system rose up before me like a vague destiny looming from\nthe Abyss.  I never before so clearly felt the Spirit of God in\nme and around rue.  The whole room seemed to me full of God.  The\nair seemed to waver to and fro with the presence of Something I\nknew not what.  I spoke with the calmness and clearness of a\nprophet.  I cannot tell you what this revelation was.  I have not\nyet studied it enough.  But I shall perfect it one day, and then\nyou shall hear it and acknowledge its grandeur.\"[27]",
        "[27] Letters of Lowell, i. 75.",
        "<66> Here is a longer and more developed experience from a\nmanuscript communication by a clergyman–I take it from\nStarbuck’s manuscript collection:–",
        "“I remember the night, and almost the very spot on the hill-top,\nwhere my soul opened out, as it were, into the Infinite, and\nthere was a rushing together of the two worlds, the inner and the\nouter.  It was deep calling unto deep–the deep that my own\nstruggle had opened up within being answered by the unfathomable\ndeep without, reaching beyond the stars.  I stood alone with Him\nwho had made me, and all the beauty of the world, and love, and\nsorrow, and even temptation.  I did not seek Him, but felt the\nperfect unison of my spirit with His.  The ordinary sense of\nthings around me faded.  For the moment nothing but an ineffable\njoy and exultation remained.  It is impossible fully to describe\nthe experience.  It was like the effect of some great orchestra\nwhen all the separate notes have melted into one swelling harmony\nthat leaves the listener conscious of nothing save that his soul\nis being wafted upwards, and almost bursting with its own\nemotion.  The perfect stillness of the night was thrilled by a\nmore solemn silence.  The darkness held a presence that was all\nthe more felt because it was not seen.  I could not any more have\ndoubted that HE was there than that I was.  Indeed, I felt myself\nto be, if possible, the less real of the two.",
        "“My highest faith in God and truest idea of him were then born in\nme.  I have stood upon the Mount of Vision since, and felt the\nEternal round about me.  But never since has there come quite the\nsame stirring of the heart.  Then, if ever, I believe, I stood\nface to face with God, and was born anew of his spirit. There\nwas, as I recall it, no sudden change of thought or of belief,\nexcept that my early crude conception, had, as it were burst into\nflower.  There was no destruction of the old, but a rapid,\nwonderful unfolding.  Since that time no discussion that I have\nheard of the proofs of God’s existence has been able to shake my\nfaith.  Having once felt the presence of God’s spirit, I have\nnever lost it again for long.  My most assuring evidence of his\nexistence is deeply rooted in that hour of vision in the memory\nof that supreme experience, and in the conviction, gained from\nreading and reflection, that something the same has come to all\nwho have found God.  I am aware that it may justly be called\nmystical.  I am not enough acquainted with philosophy to defend\nit from that or any other charge.  I feel that in writing of it I\nhave overlaid it with words rather than put it clearly to your\nthought.  But, such as it is, I have described it as carefully as\nI now am able to do.”",
        "Here is another document, even more definite in character, which,\nthe writer being a Swiss, I translate from the French\noriginal.[28]",

        "“I was in perfect health:  we were on our sixth day of tramping,\nand in good training.  We had come the day before from Sixt to\nTrient by Buet.  I felt neither fatigue, hunger, nor thirst, and\nmy state of mind was equally healthy.  I had had at Forlaz good\nnews from home; I was subject to no anxiety, either near or\nremote, for we had a good guide, and there was not a shadow of\nuncertainty about the road we should follow.  I can best describe\nthe condition in which I was by calling it a state of\nequilibrium.  When all at once I experienced a feeling of being\nraised above myself, I felt the presence of God–I tell of the\nthing just as I was conscious of it–as if his goodness and his\npower were penetrating me altogether.  The throb of emotion was\nso violent that I could barely tell the boys to pass on and not\nwait for me.  I then sat down on a stone, unable to stand any\nlonger, and my eyes overflowed with tears.  I thanked God that in\nthe course of my life he had taught me to know him, that he\nsustained my life and took pity both on the insignificant\ncreature and on the sinner that I was.  I begged him ardently\nthat my life might be consecrated to the doing of his will.  I\nfelt his reply, which was that I should do his will from day to\nday in humility and poverty, leaving him, the Almighty God, to be\njudge of whether I should some time be called to bear witness\nmore conspicuously.  Then, slowly, the ecstasy left my heart;\nthat is, I felt that God had withdrawn the communion which he had\ngranted, and I was able to walk on, but very slowly, so strongly\nwas I still possessed by the interior emotion. Besides, I had\nwept uninterruptedly for several minutes, my eyes were swollen,\nand I did not wish my companions to see me.  The state of ecstasy\nmay have lasted four or five minutes, although it seemed at the\ntime to last much longer.  My comrades waited for me ten minutes\nat the cross of Barine, but I took about twenty-five or thirty\nminutes to join them, for as well as I can remember, they said\nthat I had kept them back for about half an hour.  The impression\nhad been so profound that in climbing slowly the slope I asked\nmyself if it were possible that Moses on Sinai could have had a\nmore intimate communication with God.  I think it well to add\nthat in this ecstasy of mine God had neither form, color, odor,\nnor taste; moreover, that the feeling of his presence was\naccompanied with no determinate localization. It was rather as if\nmy personality had been transformed by the presence of a\nSPIRITUAL SPIRIT.  But the more I seek words to express this\nintimate intercourse, the more I feel the impossibility of\ndescribing the thing by any of our usual images.  At bottom the\nexpression most apt to render what I felt is this:  God was\npresent, though invisible; he fell under no one of my senses, yet\nmy consciousness perceived him.”",
        "The adjective “mystical” is technically applied, most often. to\nstates that are of brief duration.  Of course such hours of\nrapture as the last two persons describe are mystical\nexperiences, of which in a later lecture I shall have much to\nsay.  Meanwhile here is the abridged record of another mystical\nor semi-mystical experience, in a mind evidently framed by nature\nfor ardent piety.  I owe it to Starbuck’s collection.  The lady\nwho gives the account is the daughter of a man well known in his\ntime as a writer against Christianity.  The suddenness of her\nconversion shows well how native the sense of God’s presence must\nbe to certain minds.  She relates that she was brought up in\nentire ignorance of Christian doctrine, but, when in Germany,\nafter being talked to by Christian friends, she read the Bible\nand prayed, and finally the plan of salvation flashed upon her\nlike a stream of light.",
        "<69> “To this day,” she writes, “I cannot understand dallying\nwith religion and the commands of God.  The very instant I heard\nmy Father’s cry calling unto me, my heart bounded in recognition.",
        "I ran, I stretched forth my arms, I cried aloud, ’Here, here I\nam, my Father.’ Oh, happy child, what should I do?  ’Love me,’\nanswered my God.  ’I do, I do,’ I cried passionately. ’Come unto\nme,’ called my Father.  ’I will,’ my heart panted.  Did I stop to\nask a single question?  Not one.  It never occurred to me to ask\nwhether I was good enough, or to hesitate over my unfitness, or\nto find out what I thought of his church, or . . . to wait until\nI should be satisfied.  Satisfied! I was satisfied.  Had I not\nfound my God and my Father?  Did he not love me?  Had he not\ncalled me?  Was there not a Church into which I might enter?  . .\n. Since then I have had direct answers to prayer–so significant\nas to be almost like talking with God and hearing his answer. \nThe idea of God’s reality has never left me for one moment.”",
        "Here is still another case, the writer being a man aged\ntwenty-seven, in which the experience, probably almost as\ncharacteristic, is less vividly described:–",
        "“I have on a number of occasions felt that I had enjoyed a period\nof intimate communion with the divine.  These meetings came\nunasked and unexpected, and seemed to consist merely in the\ntemporary obliteration of the conventionalities which usually\nsurround and cover my life. . . .  Once it was when from the\nsummit of a high mountain I looked over a gashed and corrugated\nlandscape extending to a long convex of ocean that ascended to\nthe horizon, and again from the same point when I could see\nnothing beneath me but a boundless expanse of white cloud, on the\nblown surface of which a few high peaks, including the one I was\non, seemed plunging about as if they were dragging their anchors.",
        "What I felt on these occasions was a temporary loss of my own\nidentity, accompanied by an illumination which revealed to me a\ndeeper significance than I had been wont to attach to life.  It\nis in this that I find my justification for saying that I have\nenjoyed communication with God.  Of course the absence of such a\nbeing as this would be chaos. I cannot conceive of life without\nits presence.”",
        "Of the more habitual and so to speak chronic sense of God’s\npresence the following sample from Professor Starbuck’s\nmanuscript collection may serve to give an idea.  It is from a\nman aged forty-nine–probably thousands of unpretending\nChristians would write an almost identical account.",
        "“God is more real to me than any thought or thing or person.  I\nfeel his presence positively, and the more as I live in closer\nharmony with his laws as written in my body and mind.  I feel him\nin the sunshine or rain; and awe mingled with a delicious\nrestfulness most nearly describes my feelings.  I talk to him as\nto a companion in prayer and praise, and our communion is\ndelightful.  He answers me again and again, often in words so\nclearly spoken that it seems my outer ear must have carried the\ntone, but generally in strong mental impressions.  Usually a text\nof Scripture, unfolding some new view of him and his love for me,\nand care for my safety.  I could give hundreds of instances, in\nschool matters, social problems, financial difficulties, etc. \nThat he is mine and I am his never leaves me, it is an abiding\njoy.  Without it life would be a blank, a desert, a shoreless,\ntrackless waste.”",
        "I subjoin some more examples from writers of different ages and\nsexes.  They are also from Professor Starbuck’s collection, and\ntheir number might be greatly multiplied.  The first is from a\nman twenty-seven years old:–",
        "“God is quite real to me.  I talk to him and often get answers.\nThoughts sudden and distinct from any I have been entertaining\ncome to my mind after asking God for his direction.  Something\nover a year ago I was for some weeks in the direst perplexity.\nWhen the trouble first appeared before me I was dazed, but before\nlong (two or three hours) I could hear distinctly a passage of\nScripture:  ’My grace is sufficient for thee.’  Every time my\nthoughts turned to the trouble I could hear this quotation.  I\ndon’t think I ever doubted the existence of God, or had him drop\nout of my consciousness.  God has frequently stepped into my\naffairs very perceptibly, and I feel that he directs many little\ndetails all the time.  But on two or three occasions he has\nordered ways for me very contrary to my ambitions and plans.”",
        "Another statement (none the less valuable psychologically for\nbeing so decidedly childish) is that of a boy of seventeen:–",
        "“Sometimes as I go to church, I sit down, join in the service,\nand before I go out I feel as if God was with me, right side of\nme, singing and reading the Psalms with me. . . . And then again\nI feel as if I could sit beside him, and put my arms around him,\nkiss him, etc.  When I am taking Holy Communion at the altar, I\ntry to get with him and generally feel his presence.”",
        "I let a few other cases follow at random:–",
        "“God surrounds me like the physical atmosphere.  He is closer to\nme than my own breath.  In him literally I live and move and have\nmy being.\"–",
        "“There are times when I seem to stand in his very presence, to\ntalk with him.  Answers to prayer have come, sometimes direct and\noverwhelming in their revelation of his presence and powers. \nThere are times when God seems far off, but this is always my own\nfault.\"–",
        "“I have the sense of a presence, strong, and at the same time\nsoothing, which hovers over me.  Sometimes it seems to enwrap me\nwith sustaining arms.”",
        "Such is the human ontological imagination, and such is the\nconvincingness of what it brings to birth.  Unpicturable beings\nare realized, and realized with an intensity almost like that of\nan hallucination.  They determine our vital attitude as\ndecisively as the vital attitude of lovers is determined by the\nhabitual sense, by which each is haunted, of the other being in\nthe world.  A lover has notoriously this sense of the continuous\nbeing of his idol, even when his attention is addressed to other\nmatters and he no longer represents her features.  He cannot\nforget her; she uninterruptedly affects him through and through. \nI spoke of the convincingness of these feelings of reality, and I\nmust dwell a moment longer on that point.  They are as convincing\nto those who have them as any direct sensible experiences can be,\nand they are, as a rule, much more convincing than results\nestablished by mere logic ever are.  One may indeed be entirely\nwithout them; probably more than one of you here present is\nwithout them in any marked degree; but if you do have them, and\nhave them at all strongly, the probability is that you cannot\nhelp regarding them as genuine perceptions of truth, as\nrevelations of a kind of reality which no adverse argument,\nhowever unanswerable by you in words, can expel from your belief.",
        "The opinion opposed to mysticism in philosophy is sometimes\nspoken of as RATIONALISM.  Rationalism insists that all our\nbeliefs ought ultimately to find for themselves articulate\ngrounds.  Such grounds, for rationalism, must consist of four\nthings:  (1) definitely statable abstract principles; (2)\ndefinite facts of sensation; (3) definite hypotheses based on\nsuch facts; and (4) definite inferences logically drawn.  Vague\nimpressions of something indefinable have no place in the\nrationalistic system, which on its positive side is surely a\nsplendid intellectual tendency, for not only are all our\nphilosophies fruits of it, but physical science (amongst other\ngood things) is its result.",
        "Nevertheless, if we look on man’s whole mental life as it exists,\non the life of men that lies in them apart from their learning\nand science, and that they inwardly and privately follow, we have\nto confess that the part of it of which rationalism can give an\naccount is relatively superficial.  It is the part that has the\nprestige undoubtedly, for it has the loquacity, it can challenge\nyou for proofs, and chop logic, and put you down with words.  But\nit will fail to convince or convert you all the same, if your\ndumb intuitions are opposed to its conclusions.  If you have\nintuitions at all, they come from a deeper level of your nature\nthan the loquacious level which rationalism inhabits.  Your whole\nsubconscious life, your impulses, your faiths, your needs, your\ndivinations, have prepared the premises, of which your\nconsciousness now feels the weight of the result; and something\nin you absolutely KNOWS that that result must be truer than any\nlogic-chopping rationalistic talk, however clever, that may\ncontradict it.  This inferiority of the rationalistic level in\nfounding belief is just as manifest when rationalism argues for\nreligion as when it argues against it.  That vast literature of\nproofs of God’s existence drawn from the order of nature, which a\ncentury ago seemed so overwhelmingly convincing, to-day does\nlittle more than gather dust in libraries, for the simple reason\nthat our generation has ceased to believe in the kind of God it\nargued for.  Whatever sort of a being God may be, we KNOW to-day\nthat he is nevermore that mere external inventor of\n“contrivances” intended to make manifest his “glory” in which our\ngreat-grandfathers took such satisfaction, though just how we\nknow this we cannot possibly make clear by words either to others\nor to ourselves.  I defy any of you here fully to account for\nyour persuasion that if a God exist he must be a more cosmic and\ntragic personage than that Being.",
        "The truth is that in the metaphysical and religious sphere,\narticulate reasons are cogent for us only when our inarticulate\nfeelings of reality have already been impressed in favor of the\nsame conclusion.  Then, indeed, our intuitions and our reason\nwork together, and great world-ruling systems, like that of the\nBuddhist or of the Catholic philosophy, may grow up. Our\nimpulsive belief is here always what sets up the original body of\ntruth, and our articulately verbalized philosophy is but its\nshowy translation into formulas.  The unreasoned and immediate\nassurance is the deep thing in us, the reasoned argument is but a\nsurface exhibition.  Instinct leads, intelligence does but\nfollow.  If a person feels the presence of a living God after the\nfashion shown by my quotations, your critical arguments, be they\nnever so superior, will vainly set themselves to change his\nfaith.",
        "Please observe, however, that I do not yet say that it is BETTER\nthat the subconscious and non-rational should thus hold primacy\nin the religious realm.  I confine myself to simply pointing out\nthat they do so hold it as a matter of fact.",
        "So much for our sense of the reality of the religious objects.\nLet me now say a brief word more about the attitudes they\ncharacteristically awaken.",
        "We have already agreed that they are SOLEMN; and we have seen\nreason to think that the most distinctive of them is the sort of\njoy which may result in extreme cases from absolute\nself-surrender.  The sense of the kind of object to which the\nsurrender is made has much to do with determining the precise\ncomplexion of the joy; and the whole phenomenon is more complex\nthan any simple formula allows.  In the literature of the\nsubject, sadness and gladness have each been emphasized in turn. \nThe ancient saying that the first maker of the Gods was fear\nreceives voluminous corroboration from every age of religious\nhistory; but none the less does religious history show the part\nwhich joy has evermore tended to play.  Sometimes the joy has\nbeen primary; sometimes secondary, being the gladness of\ndeliverance from the fear. This latter state of things, being the\nmore complex, is also the more complete; and as we proceed, I\nthink we shall have abundant reason for refusing to leave out\neither the sadness or the gladness, if we look at religion with\nthe breadth of view which it demands.  Stated in the completest\npossible terms, a man’s religion involves both moods of\ncontraction and moods of expansion of his being.  But the\nquantitative mixture and order of these moods vary so much from\none age of the world, from one system of thought, and from one\nindividual to another, that you may insist either on the dread\nand the submission, or on the peace and the freedom as the\nessence of the matter, and still remain materially within the\nlimits of the truth.  The constitutionally sombre and the\nconstitutionally sanguine onlooker are bound to emphasize\nopposite aspects of what lies before their eyes.",
        "The constitutionally sombre religious person makes even of his\nreligious peace a very sober thing.  Danger still hovers in the\nair about it.  Flexion and contraction are not wholly checked. \nIt were sparrowlike and childish after our deliverance to explode\ninto twittering laughter and caper-cutting, and utterly to forget\nthe imminent hawk on bough.  Lie low, rather, lie low; for you\nare in the hands of a living God.  In the Book of Job, for\nexample, the impotence of man and the omnipotence of God is the\nexclusive burden of its author’s mind.  “It is as high as heaven;\nwhat canst thou do?–deeper than hell; what canst thou know?”   \nThere is an astringent relish about the truth of this conviction\nwhich some men can feel, and which for them is as near an\napproach as can be made to the feeling of religious joy.",
        "“In Job,” says that coldly truthful writer, the author of Mark\nRutherford, “God reminds us that man is not the measure of his\ncreation.  The world is immense, constructed on no plan or theory\nwhich the intellect of man can grasp. It is TRANSCENDENT\neverywhere.  This is the burden of every verse, and is the secret\nif there be one, of the poem.  Sufficient or insufficient, there\nis nothing more. . . .  God is great, we know not his ways.  He\ntakes from us all we have, but yet if we possess our souls in\npatience, we MAY pass the valley of the shadow, and come out in\nsunlight again.  We may or we may not! . . . What more have we to\nsay now than God said from the whirlwind over two thousand five\nhundred years ago?\"[29]",
        "[29] Mark Rutherford’s Deliverance, London, 1885, pp. 196, 198.",
        "If we turn to the sanguine onlooker, on the other hand, we find\nthat deliverance is felt as incomplete unless the burden be\naltogether overcome and the danger forgotten.  Such onlookers\ngive us definitions that seem to the sombre minds of whom we have\njust been speaking to leave out all the solemnity that makes\nreligious peace so different from merely animal joys.  In the\nopinion of some writers an attitude might be called religious,\nthough no touch were left in it of sacrifice or submission, no\ntendency to flexion, no bowing of the head.  Any “habitual and\nregulated admiration,” says Professor J. R. Seeley,[30] “is\nworthy to be called a religion\"; and accordingly he thinks that\nour Music, our Science, and our so-called “Civilization,” as\nthese things are now organized and admiringly believed in, form\nthe more genuine religions of our time.  Certainly the\nunhesitating and unreasoning way in which we feel that we must\ninflict our civilization upon “lower” races, by means of\nHotchkiss guns, etc., reminds one of nothing so much as of the\nearly spirit of Islam spreading its religion by the sword.",
        "[30] In his book (too little read, I fear), Natural Religion, 3d\nedition, Boston, 1886, pp. 91, 122.",
        "In my last lecture I quoted to you the ultra-radical opinion of\nMr. Havelock Ellis, that laughter of any sort may be considered a\nreligious exercise, for it bears witness to the soul’s\nemancipation.  I quoted this opinion in order to deny its\nadequacy.  But we must now settle our scores more carefully with\nthis whole optimistic way of thinking.  It is far too complex to\nbe decided off-hand.  I propose accordingly that we make of\nreligious optimism the theme of the next two lectures.",
