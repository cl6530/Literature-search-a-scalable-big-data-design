        "A “Massacree” of Palefaces",
        "“Say, fellers, I know where there’s a stavin’ Birch tree–do you want\nany bark?”",
        "“Yes, I want some,” said Little Beaver.",
        "“But hold on; I guess we better not, coz it’s right on the edge o’ our\nbush, an’ Paw’s still at the turnips.”",
        "“Now if you want a real war party,” said the Head Chief, “let’s\nmassacree the Paleface settlement up the crick and get some milk.\nWe’re just out, and I’d like to see if the place has changed any.”",
        "So the boys hid their bows and arrows and headdresses, and, forgetting\nto take a pail, they followed in Indian file the blazed trail,\ncarefully turning in their toes as they went and pointing silently to\nthe track, making signs of great danger. First they crawled up, under\ncover of one of the fences, to the barn. The doors were open and men\nworking at something. A pig wandered in from the barnyard. Then the\nboys heard a sudden scuffle, and a squeal from the pig as it scrambled\nout again, and Raften’s voice: “Consarn them pigs! Them boys ought to\nbe here to herd them.” This was sufficiently alarming to scare the\nWarriors off in great haste. They hid in the huge root-cellar and\nthere held a council of war.",
        "“Here, Great Chiefs of Sanger,” said Yan, “behold I take three straws.\nThat long one is for the Great Woodpecker, the middle size is for\nLittle Beaver, and the short thick one with the bump on the end and\na crack on top is Sappy. Now I will stack them up in a bunch and let\nthem fall, then whichever way they point we must go, for this is Big\nMedicine.”",
        "So the straws fell. Sam’s straw pointed nearly to the house, Yan’s a\nlittle to the south of the house, and Guy’s right back home.",
        "“Aha, Sappy, you got to go home; the straw says so.”",
        "“I ain’t goin’ to believe no such foolishness.”",
        "“It’s awful unlucky to go against it.”",
        "“I don’t care, I ain’t goin’ back,” said Guy doggedly.",
        "“Well, my straw says go to the house; that means go scouting for milk,\nI reckon.”",
        "Yan’s straw pointed toward the garden, and Guy’s to the residence and\ngrounds of “J.G. Burns, Esq.”",
        "“I don’t care,” said Sappy, “I ain’t goin’. I am goin’ after some\nof them cherries in your orchard, an’ ’twon’t be the first time,\nneither.”",
        "“We kin meet by the Basswood at the foot of the lane with whatever\nwe get,” said the First War Chief, as he sneaked into the bushes and\ncrawled through the snake fence and among the nettles and manure\nheaps on the north side of the barnyard till he reached the woodshed\nadjoining the house. He knew where the men were, and he could guess\nwhere his mother was, but he was worried about the Dog. Old Cap might\nbe on the front doorstep, or he might be prowling at just the wrong\nplace for the Injun plan. The woodshed butted on the end of the\nkitchen. The milk was kept in the cellar, and one window of the cellar\nopened into a dark corner of the woodshed. This was easily raised, and\nSam scrambled down into the cool damp cellar. Long rows of milk pans\nwere in sight on the shelves. He lifted the cover of the one he knew\nto be the last put there and drank a deep, long draught with his mouth\ndown to it, then licked the cream from his lips and remembered that he\nhad come without a pail. But he knew where to get one. He went\ngently up the stairs, avoiding steps Nos. 1 and 7 because they were\n“creakers,” as he found out long ago, when he used to ’hook’ maple\nsugar from the other side of the house. The door at the top was closed\nand buttoned, but he put his jack-knife blade through the crack and\nturned the button. After listening awhile and hearing no sound in the\nkitchen, he gently opened the squeaky old door. There was no one to\nbe seen but the baby, sound asleep in her cradle. The outer door was\nopen, but no Dog lying on the step as usual. Over the kitchen was a\ngarret entered by a trap-door and a ladder. The ladder was up and the\ntrap-door open, but all was still. Sam stood over the baby, grunted,\n“Ugh, Paleface papoose,” raised his hand as if wielding a war club,\naimed a deadly blow at the sleeping cherub, then stooped and kissed\nher rosy mouth so lightly that her pink fists went up to rub it at\nonce. He now went to the pantry, took a large pie and a tin pail,\nthen down into the cellar again. He, at first, merely closed the door\nbehind him and was leaving it so, but remembered that Minnie might\nawaken and toddle around till she might toddle into the cellar,\ntherefore he turned the button so that just a corner showed over the\ncrack, closed the door and worked with his knife blade on that corner\ntill the cellar was made as safe as before. He now escaped with his\npie and pail.",
        "Meanwhile his mother’s smiling face beamed out of the dark loft. Then\nshe came down the ladder. She had seen him come and enter the cellar,\nby chance she was in the loft when he reached the kitchen, but she had\nkept quiet to enjoy the joke.",
        "Next time the Woodpecker went to the cellar he found a paper with this\non it: ’Notice to hostile Injuns–Next time you massacree this\nsettlement, bring back the pail, and don’t leave the covers off the\nmilk pans.”",
        "Yan had followed the fence that ran south of the house. There was\nplenty of cover, but he crawled on hands and knees, going right down\non his breast when he came to places more open than the rest. In this\nway he had nearly reached the garden when he heard a noise behind and,\nturning, he saw Sappy.",
        "“Here, what are you following me for? Your straw pointed the other\nway. You ain’t playing fair.”",
        "“Well, I don’t care, I ain’t going home. You fixed it up so my\nstraw would point that way. It ain’t fair, an’ I won’t do it.”",
        "“You got no right following me.”",
        "“I ain’t following you, but you keep going just the place I want to\ngo. It’s you following me, on’y keepin’ ahead. I told you I was after\ncherries.”",
        "“Well, the cherries are that way and I’m going this way, and I don’t\nwant you along.”",
        "“You couldn’t get me if you wanted me.”",
        "“Erh––”",
        "“Erh––”",
        "So Sappy went cherryward and Yan waited awhile, then crawled toward\nthe fruit garden. After twenty or thirty yards more, he saw a gleam of\nred, then under it a bright yellow eye glaring at him. He had chanced\non a hen sitting on her nest. He came nearer, she took alarm and ran\naway, not clucking, but cackling loudly. There were a dozen eggs of\ntwo different styles, all bright and clean, and the hen’s comb was\nbright red. Yan knew hens. This was easy to read: Two stray hens\nlaying in one nest, and neither of them sitting yet.",
        "“So ho! Straws show which way the hens go.”",
        "He gathered up the eggs into his hat and crawled back toward the tree\nwhere all had to meet.",
        "But before he had gone far he heard a loud barking, then yells for\nhelp, and turned in time to see Guy scramble up a tree while Cap, the\nold Collie, barked savagely at him from below. Now that he was in no\ndanger Sappy had the sense to keep quiet. Yan came back as quickly\nas possible. The Dog at once recognized and obeyed him, but\ndoubtless was much puzzled to make out why he should be pelted back to\nthe house when he had so nobly done his duty by the orchard.",
        "“Now, you see, maybe next time you’ll do what the medicine straw tells\nyou. Only for me you’d been caught and fed to the pigs, sure.”",
        "“Only for you I wouldn’t have come. I wasn’t scared of your old Dog,\nanyway. Just in about two minutes more I was comin’ down to kick the\nstuffin’ out o’ him myself.”",
        "“Perhaps you’d like to go back and do it now. I’ll soon call him.”",
        "“Oh, I hain’t got time now, but some other time–Let’s find Sam.”",
        "So they foregathered at the tree, and laden with their spoils, they\nreturned gloriously to camp.",
