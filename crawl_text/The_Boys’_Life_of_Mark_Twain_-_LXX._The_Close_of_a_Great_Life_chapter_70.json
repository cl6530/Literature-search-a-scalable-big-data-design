        "Mark Twain lived just a week from that day and hour.  For a time he\nseemed full of life, talking freely, and suffering little.  Clara and\nOssip Gabrilowitsch arrived on Saturday and found him cheerful, quite\nlike himself.  At intervals he read.  “Suetonius” and “Carlyle” lay on\nthe bed beside him, and he would pick them up and read a page or a\nparagraph.  Sometimes when I saw him thus–the high color still in his\nface, the clear light in his eyes’–I said: “It is not reality.  He is\nnot going to die.”",
        "But by Wednesday of the following week it was evident that the end was\nnear.  We did not know it then, but the mysterious messenger of his birth\nyear, Halley’s comet, became visible that night in the sky.[13]",
        "On Thursday morning, the 21st, his mind was still fairly clear, and he\nread a little from one of the volumes on his bed.  By Clara he sent word\nthat he wished to see me, and when I came in he spoke of two unfinished\nmanuscripts which he wished me to “throw away,” as he briefly expressed\nit, for his words were few, now, and uncertain.  I assured him that I\nwould attend to the matter and he pressed my hand.  It was his last word\nto me.  During the afternoon, while Clara stood by him, he sank into a\ndoze, and from it passed into a deeper slumber and did not heed us any\nmore.",
        "Through that peaceful spring afternoon the life-wave ebbed lower and\nlower.  It was about half-past six, and the sun lay just on the horizon,\nwhen Dr. Quintard noticed that the breathing, which had gradually become\nmore subdued, broke a little.  There was no suggestion of any struggle.\nThe noble head turned a little to one side, there was a fluttering sigh,\nand the breath that had been unceasing for seventy-four tumultuous years\nhad stopped forever.",
        "In the Brick Church, New York, Mark Twain–dressed in the white he loved\nso well–lay, with the nobility of death upon him, while a multitude of\nthose who loved him passed by and looked at his face for the last time.\nFlowers in profusion were banked about him, but on the casket lay a\nsingle wreath which Dan Beard and his wife had woven from the laurel\nwhich grows on Stormfield hill.  He was never more beautiful than as he\nlay there, and it was an impressive scene to see those thousands file by,\nregard him for a moment, gravely, thoughtfully, and pass on.  All sorts\nwere there, rich and poor; some crossed themselves, some saluted, some\npaused a little to take a closer look.",
        "That night we went with him to Elmira, and next day he lay in those\nstately parlors that had seen his wedding-day, and where little Langdon\nand Susy had lain, and Mrs. Clemens, and then Jean, only a little while\nbefore.",
        "The worn-out body had reached its journey’s end; but his spirit had never\ngrown old, and to-day, still young, it continues to cheer and comfort a\ntired world.",
