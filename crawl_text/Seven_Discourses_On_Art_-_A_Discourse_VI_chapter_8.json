        "Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution\nof the Prizes, December 10, 1774, by the President.",
        "Gentlemen,–When I have taken the liberty of addressing you on the\ncourse and order of your studies, I never proposed to enter into a\nminute detail of the art.  This I have always left to the several\nprofessors, who pursue the end of our institution with the highest\nhonour to themselves, and with the greatest advantage to the\nstudents.",
        "My purpose in the discourses I have held in the Academy is to lay\ndown certain general ideas, which seem to me proper for the\nformation of a sound taste; principles necessary to guard the\npupils against those errors into which the sanguine temper common\nat their time of life, has a tendency to lead them, and which have\nrendered abortive the hopes of so many successions of promising\nyoung men in all parts of Europe.",
        "I wish, also, to intercept and suppress those prejudices which\nparticularly prevail when the mechanism of painting is come to its\nperfection, and which when they do prevail are certain to prevail\nto the utter destruction of the higher and more valuable parts of\nthis literate and liberal profession.",
        "These two have been my principal purposes; they are still as much\nmy concern as ever; and if I repeat my own ideas on the subject,\nyou who know how fast mistake and prejudice, when neglected, gain\nground upon truth and reason, will easily excuse me.  I only\nattempt to set the same thing in the greatest variety of lights.",
        "The subject of this discourse will be imitation, as far as a\npainter is concerned in it.  By imitation I do not mean imitation\nin its largest sense, but simply the following of other masters,\nand the advantage to be drawn from the study of their works.",
        "Those who have undertaken to write on our art, and have represented\nit as a kind of inspiration, as a gift bestowed upon peculiar\nfavourites at their birth, seem to ensure a much more favourable\ndisposition from their readers, and have a much more captivating\nand liberal air, than he who goes about to examine, coldly, whether\nthere are any means by which this art may be acquired; how our mind\nmay be strengthened and expanded, and what guides will show the way\nto eminence.",
        "It is very natural for those who are unacquainted with the cause of\nanything extraordinary to be astonished at the effect, and to\nconsider it as a kind of magic.  They, who have never observed the\ngradation by which art is acquired, who see only what is the full\nresult of long labour and application of an infinite number, and\ninfinite variety of acts, are apt to conclude from their entire\ninability to do the same at once, that it is not only inaccessible\nto themselves, but can be done by those only who have some gift of\nthe nature of inspiration bestowed upon them.",
        "The travellers into the East tell us that when the ignorant\ninhabitants of these countries are asked concerning the ruins of\nstately edifices yet remaining amongst them, the melancholy\nmonuments of their former grandeur and long-lost science, they\nalways answer that they were built by magicians.  The untaught mind\nfinds a vast gulf between its own powers and these works of\ncomplicated art which it is utterly unable to fathom.  And it\nsupposes that such a void can be passed only by supernatural\npowers.",
        "And, as for artists themselves, it is by no means their interest to\nundeceive such judges, however conscious they may be of the very\nnatural means by which the extraordinary powers were acquired; our\nart being intrinsically imitative, rejects this idea of inspiration\nmore, perhaps, than any other.",
        "It is to avoid this plain confession of truth, as it should seem,\nthat this imitation of masters–indeed, almost all imitation which\nimplies a more regular and progressive method of attaining the ends\nof painting–has ever been particularly inveighed against with\ngreat keenness, both by ancient and modern writers.",
        "To derive all from native power, to owe nothing to another, is the\npraise which men, who do not much think what they are saying,\nbestow sometimes upon others, and sometimes on themselves; and\ntheir imaginary dignity is naturally heightened by a supercilious\ncensure of the low, the barren, the grovelling, the servile\nimitator.  It would be no wonder if a student, frightened by these\nterrors and disgraceful epithets, with which the poor imitators are\nso often loaded, should let fall his pencil in mere despair,\nconscious how much he has been indebted to the labours of others,\nhow little, how very little of his art was born with him; and,\nconsidering it as hopeless, to set about acquiring by the imitation\nof any human master what he is taught to suppose is matter of\ninspiration from heaven.",
        "Some allowance must be made for what is said in the gaiety or\nambition of rhetoric.  We cannot suppose that any one can really\nmean to exclude all imitation of others.  A position so wild would\nscarce deserve a serious answer, for it is apparent, if we were\nforbid to make use of the advantages which our predecessors afford\nus, the art would be always to begin, and consequently remain\nalways in its infant state; and it is a common observation that no\nart was ever invented and carried to perfection at the same time.",
        "But to bring us entirely to reason and sobriety, let it be\nobserved, that a painter must not only be of necessity an imitator\nof the works of nature, which alone is sufficient to dispel this\nphantom of inspiration, but he must be as necessarily an imitator\nof the works of other painters.  This appears more humiliating, but\nit is equally true; and no man can be an artist, whatever he may\nsuppose, upon any other terms.",
        "However, those who appear more moderate and reasonable allow that\nstudy is to begin by imitation, but that we should no longer use\nthe thoughts of our predecessors when we are become able to think\nfor ourselves.  They hold that imitation is as hurtful to the more\nadvanced student as it was advantageous to the beginner.",
        "For my own part, I confess I am not only very much disposed to lay\ndown the absolute necessity of imitation in the first stages of the\nart, but am of opinion that the study of other masters, which I\nhere call imitation, may be extended throughout our whole life\nwithout any danger of the inconveniences with which it is charged,\nof enfeebling the mind, or preventing us from giving that original\nair which every work undoubtedly ought always to have.",
        "I am, on the contrary, persuaded that by imitation only, variety,\nand even originality of invention is produced.",
        "I will go further; even genius, at least what generally is so\ncalled, is the child of imitation.  But as this appears to be\ncontrary to the general opinion, I must explain my position before\nI enforce it.",
        "Genius is supposed to be a power of producing excellences which are\nout of the reach of the rules of art–a power which no precepts can\nteach, and which no industry can acquire.",
        "This opinion of the impossibility of acquiring those beauties which\nstamp the work with the character of genius, supposes that it is\nsomething more fixed than in reality it is, and that we always do,\nand ever did agree, about what should be considered as a\ncharacteristic of genius.",
        "But the truth is that the degree of excellence which proclaims\ngenius is different in different times and different places; and\nwhat shows it to be so is that mankind have often changed their\nopinion upon this matter.",
        "When the arts were in their infancy, the power of merely drawing\nthe likeness of any object was considered as one of its greatest\nefforts.",
        "The common people, ignorant of the principles of art, talk the same\nlanguage even to this day.  But when it was found that every man\ncould be taught to do this, and a great deal more, merely by the\nobservance of certain precepts, the name of genius then shifted its\napplication, and was given only to those who added the peculiar\ncharacter of the object they represented; to those who had\ninvention, expression, grace, or dignity; or, in short, such\nqualities or excellences the producing of which could not then be\ntaught by any known and promulgated rules.",
        "We are very sure that the beauty of form, the expression of the\npassions, the art of composition, even the power of giving a\ngeneral air of grandeur to your work, is at present very much under\nthe dominion of rules.  These excellences were, heretofore,\nconsidered merely as the effects of genius; and justly, if genius\nis not taken for inspiration, but as the effect of close\nobservation and experience.",
        "He who first made any of these observations and digested them, so\nas to form an invariable principle for himself to work by, had that\nmerit; but probably no one went very far at once; and generally the\nfirst who gave the hint did not know how to pursue it steadily and\nmethodically, at least not in the beginning.  He himself worked on\nit, and improved it; others worked more, and improved farther,\nuntil the secret was discovered, and the practice made as general\nas refined practice can be made.  How many more principles may be\nfixed and ascertained we cannot tell; but as criticism is likely to\ngo hand in hand with the art which is its subject, we may venture\nto say that as that art shall advance, its powers will be still\nmore and more fixed by rules.",
        "But by whatever strides criticism may gain ground, we need be under\nno apprehension that invention will ever be annihilated or subdued,\nor intellectual energy be brought entirely within the restraint of\nwritten law.  Genius will still have room enough to expatiate, and\nkeep always the same distance from narrow comprehension and\nmechanical performance.",
        "What we now call genius begins, not where rules, abstractedly\ntaken, end, but where known vulgar and trite rules have no longer\nany place.  It must of necessity be that even works of genius, as\nwell as every other effect, as it must have its cause, must\nlikewise have its rules; it cannot be by chance that excellences\nare produced with any constancy, or any certainty, for this is not\nthe nature of chance, but the rules by which men of extraordinary\nparts, and such as are called men of genius work, are either such\nas they discover by their own peculiar observation, or of such a\nnice texture as not easily to admit handling or expressing in\nwords, especially as artists are not very frequently skilful in\nthat mode of communicating ideas.",
        "Unsubstantial, however, as these rules may seem, and difficult as\nit may be to convey them in writing, they are still seen and felt\nin the mind of the artist, and he works from them with as much\ncertainty as if they were embodied, as I may say, upon paper.  It\nis true these refined principles cannot be always made palpable,\nlike the more gross rules of art; yet it does not follow but that\nthe mind may be put in such a train that it shall perceive, by a\nkind of scientific sense, that propriety which words, particularly\nwords of unpractised writers such as we are, can but very feebly\nsuggest.",
        "Invention is one of the great marks of genius, but if we consult\nexperience, we shall find that it is by being conversant with the\ninventions of others that we learn to invent, as by reading the\nthoughts of others we learn to think.",
        "Whoever has so far formed his taste as to be able to relish and\nfeel the beauties of the great masters has gone a great way in his\nstudy; for, merely from a consciousness of this relish of the\nright, the mind swells with an inward pride, and is almost as\npowerfully affected as if it had itself produced what it admires.\nOur hearts frequently warmed in this manner by the contact of those\nwhom we wish to resemble, will undoubtedly catch something of their\nway of thinking, and we shall receive in our own bosoms some\nradiation at least of their fire and splendour.  That disposition,\nwhich is so strong in children, still continues with us, of\ncatching involuntarily the general air and manner of those with\nwhom we are most conversant; with this difference only, that a\nyoung mind is naturally pliable and imitative, but in a more\nadvanced state it grows rigid, and must be warmed and softened\nbefore it will receive a deep impression.",
        "From these considerations, which a little of your reflection will\ncarry a great way further, it appears of what great consequence it\nis that our minds should be habituated to the contemplation of\nexcellence, and that, far from being contented to make such habits\nthe discipline of our youth only, we should, to the last moment of\nour lives, continue a settled intercourse with all the true\nexamples of grandeur.  Their inventions are not only the food of\nour infancy, but the substance which supplies the fullest maturity\nof our vigour.",
        "The mind is but a barren soil; is a soil soon exhausted, and will\nproduce no crop, or only one, unless it be continually fertilised\nand enriched with foreign matter.",
        "When we have had continually before us the great works of art to\nimpregnate our minds with kindred ideas, we are then, and not till\nthen, fit to produce something, of the same species.  We behold all\nabout us with the eyes of these penetrating observers, and our\nminds, accustomed to think the thoughts of the noblest and\nbrightest intellects, are prepared for the discovery and selection\nof all that is great and noble in nature.  The greatest natural\ngenius cannot subsist on its own stock:  he who resolves never to\nransack any mind but his own will be soon reduced, from mere\nbarrenness, to the poorest of all imitations; he will be obliged to\nimitate himself, and to repeat what he has before often repeated.\nWhen we know the subject designed by such men, it will never be\ndifficult to guess what kind of work is to be produced.",
        "It is vain for painters or poets to endeavour to invent without\nmaterials on which the mind may work, and from which invention must\noriginate.  Nothing can come of nothing.",
        "Homer is supposed to be possessed of all the learning of his time.\nAnd we are certain that Michael Angelo and Raffaelle were equally\npossessed of all knowledge in the art which was discoverable in the\nworks of their predecessors.",
        "A mind enriched by an assemblage of all the treasures of ancient\nand modern art will be more elevated and fruitful in resources in\nproportion to the number of ideas which have been carefully\ncollected and thoroughly digested.  There can be no doubt that he\nwho has the most materials has the greatest means of invention; and\nif he has not the power of using them, it must proceed from a\nfeebleness of intellect or from the confused manner in which those\ncollections have been laid up in his mind.",
        "The addition of other men’s judgment is so far from weakening, as\nis the opinion of many, our own, that it will fashion and\nconsolidate those ideas of excellence which lay in their birth\nfeeble, ill-shaped, and confused, but which are finished and put in\norder by the authority and practice of those whose works may be\nsaid to have been consecrated by having stood the test of ages.",
        "The mind, or genius, has been compared to a spark of fire which is\nsmothered by a heap of fuel and prevented from blazing into a\nflame.  This simile, which is made use of by the younger Pliny, may\nbe easily mistaken for argument or proof.",
        "There is no danger of the mind’s being over-burdened with\nknowledge, or the genius extinguished by any addition of images; on\nthe contrary, these acquisitions may as well, perhaps better, be\ncompared, if comparisons signified anything in reasoning, to the\nsupply of living embers, which will contribute to strengthen the\nspark that without the association of more would have died away.",
        "The truth is, he whose feebleness is such as to make other men’s\nthoughts an incumbrance to him can have no very great strength of\nmind or genius of his own to be destroyed, so that not much harm\nwill be done at worst.",
        "We may oppose to Pliny the greater authority of Cicero, who is\ncontinually enforcing the necessity of this method of study.  In\nhis dialogue on Oratory he makes Crassus say, that one of the first\nand most important precepts is to choose a proper model for our\nimitation.  Hoc fit primum in preceptis meis ut demonstremus quem\nimitemur.",
        "When I speak of the habitual imitation and continued study of\nmasters, it is not to be understood that I advise any endeavour to\ncopy the exact peculiar colour and complexion of another man’s\nmind; the success of such an attempt must always be like his who\nimitates exactly the air, manner, and gestures of him whom he\nadmires.  His model may be excellent, but the copy will be\nridiculous; this ridicule does not arise from his having imitated,\nbut from his not having chosen the right mode of imitation.",
        "It is a necessary and warrantable pride to disdain to walk\nservilely behind any individual, however elevated his rank.  The\ntrue and liberal ground of imitation is an open field, where,\nthough he who precedes has had the advantage of starting before\nyou, yet it is enough to pursue his course; you need not tread in\nhis footsteps, and you certainly have a right to outstrip him if\nyou can.",
        "Nor, whilst I recommend studying the art from artists, can I be\nsupposed to mean that nature is to be neglected?  I take this study\nin aid and not in exclusion of the other.  Nature is, and must be,\nthe fountain which alone is inexhaustible; and from which all\nexcellences must originally flow.",
        "The great use of studying our predecessors is to open the mind, to\nshorten our labour, and to give us the result of the selection made\nby those great minds of what is grand or beautiful in nature:  her\nrich stores are all spread out before us; but it is an art, and no\neasy art, to know how or what to choose, and how to attain and\nsecure the object of our choice.",
        "Thus the highest beauty of form must be taken from nature; but it\nis an art of long deduction and great experience to know how to\nfind it.",
        "We must not content ourselves with merely admiring and relishing;\nwe must enter into the principles on which the work is wrought;\nthese do not swim on the superficies, and consequently are not open\nto superficial observers.",
        "Art in its perfection is not ostentatious; it lies hid, and works\nits effect itself unseen.  It is the proper study and labour of an\nartist to uncover and find out the latent cause of conspicuous\nbeauties, and from thence form principles for his own conduct; such\nan examination is a continual exertion of the mind, as great,\nperhaps, as that of the artist whose works he is thus studying.",
        "The sagacious imitator not only remarks what distinguishes the\ndifferent manner or genius of each master; he enters into the\ncontrivance in the composition, how the masses of lights are\ndisposed, the means by which the effect is produced, how artfully\nsome parts are lost in the ground, others boldly relieved, and how\nall these are mutually altered and interchanged according to the\nreason and scheme of the work.  He admires not the harmony of\ncolouring alone, but he examines by what artifice one colour is a\nfoil to its neighbour.  He looks close into the tints, of what\ncolours they are composed, till he has formed clear and distinct\nideas, and has learnt to see in what harmony and good colouring\nconsists.  What is learnt in this manner from the works of others\nbecomes really our own, sinks deep, and is never forgotten; nay, it\nis by seizing on this clue that we proceed forward, and get further\nand further in enlarging the principle and improving the practice.",
        "There can be no doubt but the art is better learnt from the works\nthemselves than from the precepts which are formed upon these\nworks; but if it is difficult to choose proper models for\nimitation, it requires no less circumspection to separate and\ndistinguish what in those models we ought to imitate.",
        "I cannot avoid mentioning here, though it is not my intention at\npresent to enter into the art and method of study, an error which\nstudents are too apt to fall into.",
        "He that is forming himself must look with great caution and\nwariness on those peculiarities, or prominent parts, which at first\nforce themselves upon view, and are the marks, or what is commonly\ncalled the manner, by which that individual artist is\ndistinguished.",
        "Peculiar marks I hold to be generally, if not always, defects,\nhowever difficult it may be, wholly to escape them.",
        "Peculiarities in the works of art are like those in the human\nfigure; it is by them that we are cognisable and distinguished one\nfrom another, but they are always so many blemishes, which,\nhowever, both in the one case and in the other, cease to appear\ndeformities to those who have them continually before their eyes.\nIn the works of art, even the most enlightened mind, when warmed by\nbeauties of the highest kind, will by degrees find a repugnance\nwithin him to acknowledge any defects; nay, his enthusiasm will\ncarry him so far as to transform them into beauties and objects of\nimitation.",
        "It must be acknowledged that a peculiarity of style, either from\nits novelty, or by seeming to proceed from a peculiar turn of mind,\noften escapes blame; on the contrary, it is sometimes striking and\npleasing; but this it is vain labour to endeavour to imitate,\nbecause novelty and peculiarity being its only merit, when it\nceases to be new, it ceases to have value.",
        "A manner, therefore, being a defect, and every painter, however\nexcellent, having a manner, it seems to follow that all kinds of\nfaults, as well as beauties, may be learned under the sanction of\nthe greatest authorities.",
        "Even the great name of Michael Angelo may be used to keep in\ncountenance a deficiency, or rather neglect of colouring, and every\nother ornamental part of the art.",
        "If the young student is dry and hard, Poussin is the same.  If his\nwork has a careless and unfinished air, he has most of the Venetian\nSchool to support him.  If he makes no selection of objects, but\ntakes individual nature just as he finds it, he is like Rembrandt.\nIf he is incorrect in the proportions of his figures, Correggio was\nlikewise incorrect.  If his colours are not blended and united,\nRubens was equally crude.",
        "In short, there is no defect but may be excused, if it is a\nsufficient excuse that it can be imputed to considerable artists;\nbut it must be remembered that it was not by these defects they\nacquired their reputation:  they have a right to our pardon, but\nnot to our admiration.",
        "However, to imitate peculiarities or mistake defects for beauties\nthat man will be most liable who confines his imitation to one\nfavourite master; and, even though he chooses the best, and is\ncapable of distinguishing the real excellences of his model, it is\nnot by such narrow practice that a genius or mastery in the art is\nacquired.  A man is as little likely to form a true idea of the\nperfection of the art by studying a single artist as he would be of\nproducing a perfectly beautiful figure by an exact imitation of any\nindividual living model.",
        "And as the painter, by bringing together in one piece those\nbeauties which are dispersed amongst a great variety of\nindividuals, produces a figure more beautiful than can be found in\nnature, so that artist who can unite in himself the excellences of\nthe various painters, will approach nearer to perfection than any\none of his masters.",
        "He who confines himself to the imitation of an individual, as he\nnever proposes to surpass, so he is not likely to equal, the object\nof imitation.  He professes only to follow, and he that follows\nmust necessarily be behind.",
        "We should imitate the conduct of the great artists in the course of\ntheir studies, as well as the works which they produced, when they\nwere perfectly formed.  Raffaelle began by imitating implicitly the\nmanner of Pietro Perugino, under whom he studied; so his first\nworks are scarce to be distinguished from his master’s; but soon\nforming higher and more extensive views, he imitated the grand\noutline of Michael Angelo.  He learnt the manner of using colours\nfrom the works of Leonardo da Vinci and Fratre Bartolomeo:  to all\nthis he added the contemplation of all the remains of antiquity\nthat were within his reach, and employed others to draw for him\nwhat was in Greece and distant places.  And it is from his having\ntaken so many models that he became himself a model for all\nsucceeding painters, always imitating, and always original.",
        "If your ambition therefore be to equal Raffaelle, you must do as\nRaffaelle did; take many models, and not take even him for your\nguide alone to the exclusion of others.  And yet the number is\ninfinite of those who seem, if one may judge by their style, to\nhave seen no other works but those of their master, or of some\nfavourite whose manner is their first wish and their last.",
        "I will mention a few that occur to me of this narrow, confined,\nilliberal, unscientific, and servile kind of imitators.  Guido was\nthus meanly copied by Elizabetta Sirani, and Simone Cantarini;\nPoussin, by Verdier and Cheron; Parmigiano, by Jeronimo Mazzuoli;\nPaolo Veronese and Iacomo Bassan had for their imitators their\nbrothers and sons; Pietro de Cortona was followed by Ciro Ferri and\nRomanelli; Rubens, by Jacques Jordans and Diepenbeck; Guercino, by\nhis own family, the Gennari; Carlo Marratti was imitated by\nGiuseppe Chiari and Pietro da Pietri; and Rembrandt, by Bramer,\nEckhout, and Flink.  All these, to whom may be added a much longer\nlist of painters, whose works among the ignorant pass for those of\ntheir masters, are justly to be censured for barrenness and\nservility.",
        "To oppose to this list a few that have adopted a more liberal style\nof imitation:  Pelegrino Tibaldi, Rosso, and Primaticio did not\ncoldly imitate, but caught something of the fire that animates the\nworks of Michael Angelo.  The Carraches formed their style from\nPelegrino Tibaldi, Correggio, and the Venetian School.\nDomenichino, Guido, Lanfranco, Albano, Guercino, Cavidone,\nSchidone, Tiarini, though it is sufficiently apparent that they\ncame from the School of the Carraches, have yet the appearance of\nmen who extended their views beyond the model that lay before them,\nand have shown that they had opinions of their own, and thought for\nthemselves, after they had made themselves masters of the general\nprinciples of their schools.",
        "Le Seure’s first manner resembles very much that of his master\nVovet:  but as he soon excelled him, so he differed from him in\nevery part of the art.  Carlo Marratti succeeded better than those\nI have first named, and I think owes his superiority to the\nextension of his views; besides his master Andrea Sacchi, he\nimitated Raffaelle, Guido, and the Carraches.  It is true, there is\nnothing very captivating in Carlo Marratti; but this proceeded from\nwants which cannot be completely supplied; that is, want of\nstrength of parts.  In this, certainly men are not equal, and a man\ncan bring home wares only in proportion to the capital with which\nhe goes to market.  Carlo, by diligence, made the most of what he\nhad; but there was undoubtedly a heaviness about him, which\nextended itself, uniformly to his invention, expression, his\ndrawing, colouring, and the general effect of his pictures.  The\ntruth is, he never equalled any of his patterns in any one thing,\nand he added little of his own.",
        "But we must not rest contented, even in this general study of the\nmoderns; we must trace back the art to its fountain head, to that\nsource from whence they drew their principal excellences, the\nmonuments of pure antiquity.",
        "All the inventions and thoughts of the ancients, whether conveyed\nto us in statues, bas-reliefs, intaglios, cameos, or coins, are to\nbe sought after and carefully studied:  The genius that hovers over\nthese venerable relics may be called the father of modern art.",
        "From the remains of the works of the ancients the modern arts were\nrevived, and it is by their means that they must be restored a\nsecond time.  However it may mortify our vanity, we must be forced\nto allow them our masters; and we may venture to prophecy, that\nwhen they shall cease to be studied, arts will no longer flourish,\nand we shall again relapse into barbarism.",
        "The fire of the artist’s own genius operating upon these materials\nwhich have been thus diligently collected, will enable him to make\nnew combinations, perhaps, superior to what had ever before been in\nthe possession of the art.  As in the mixture of the variety of\nmetals, which are said to have been melted and run together at the\nburning of Corinth, a new and till then unknown metal was produced\nequal in value to any of those that had contributed to its\ncomposition.  And though a curious refiner may come with his\ncrucibles, analyse and separate its various component parts, yet\nCorinthian brass would still hold its rank amongst the most\nbeautiful and valuable of metals.",
        "We have hitherto considered the advantages of imitation as it tends\nto form the taste, and as a practice by which a spark of that\ngenius may be caught which illumines these noble works, that ought\nalways to be present to our thoughts.",
        "We come now to speak of another kind of imitation; the borrowing a\nparticular thought, an action, attitude, or figure, and\ntransplanting it into your own work:  this will either come under\nthe charge of plagiarism, or be warrantable, and deserve\ncommendation, according to the address with which it is performed.\nThere is some difference likewise whether it is upon the ancients\nor the moderns that these depredations are made.  It is generally\nallowed that no man need be ashamed of copying the ancients:  their\nworks are considered as a magazine of common property, always open\nto the public, whence every man has a right to what materials he\npleases; and if he has the art of using them, they are supposed to\nbecome to all intents and purposes his own property.",
        "The collection which Raffaelle made of the thoughts of the ancients\nwith so much trouble, is a proof of his opinion on this subject.\nSuch collections may be made with much more ease, by means of an\nart scarce known in his time; I mean that of engraving, by which,\nat an easy rate, every man may now avail himself of the inventions\nof antiquity.",
        "It must be acknowledged that the works of the moderns are more the\nproperty of their authors; he who borrows an idea from an artist,\nor perhaps from a modern, not his contemporary, and so accommodates\nit to his own work that it makes a part of it, with no seam or\njoining appearing, can hardly be charged with plagiarism; poets\npractise this kind of borrowing without reserve.  But an artist\nshould not be contented with this only; he should enter into a\ncompetition with his original, and endeavour to improve what he is\nappropriating to his own work.  Such imitation is so far from\nhaving anything in it of the servility of plagiarism, that it is a\nperpetual exercise of the mind, a continual invention.",
        "Borrowing or stealing with such art and caution will have a right\nto the same lenity as was used by the Lacedemonians; who did not\npunish theft, but the want of artifice to conceal it.",
        "In order to encourage you to imitation, to the utmost extent, let\nme add, that very finished artists in the inferior branches of the\nart will contribute to furnish the mind and give hints of which a\nskilful painter, who is sensible of what he wants, and is in no\ndanger of being infected by the contact of vicious models, will\nknow how to avail himself.  He will pick up from dunghills what by\na nice chemistry, passing through his own mind, shall be converted\ninto pure gold; and, under the rudeness of Gothic essays, he will\nfind original, rational, and even sublime inventions.",
        "In the luxuriant style of Paul Veronese, in the capricious\ncompositions of Tintoret, he will find something that will assist\nhis invention, and give points, from which his own imagination\nshall rise and take flight, when the subject which he treats will,\nwith propriety, admit of splendid effects.",
        "In every school, whether Venetian, French, or Dutch, he will find\neither ingenious compositions, extraordinary effects, some peculiar\nexpressions, or some mechanical excellence, well worthy his\nattention and, in some measure, of his imitation; even in the lower\nclass of the French painters, great beauties are often found united\nwith great defects.",
        "Though Coypel wanted a simplicity of taste, and mistook a\npresumptuous and assuming air for what is grand and majestic; yet\nhe frequently has good sense and judgment in his manner of telling\nhis stories, great skill in his compositions, and is not without a\nconsiderable power of expressing the passions, The modern\naffectation of grace in his works, as well as in those of Bouche\nand Watteau, may be said to be separated by a very thin partition\nfrom the more simple and pure grace of Correggio and Parmigiano.",
        "Amongst the Dutch painters, the correct, firm, and determined\npencil, which was employed by Bamboccio and Jan Miel on vulgar and\nmean subjects, might without any change be employed on the highest,\nto which, indeed, it seems more properly to belong.  The greatest\nstyle, if that style is confined to small figures such as Poussin\ngenerally painted, would receive an additional grace by the\nelegance and precision of pencil so admirable in the works of\nTeniers.",
        "Though this school more particularly excelled in the mechanism of\npainting, yet there are many who have shown great abilities in\nexpressing what must be ranked above mechanical excellences.",
        "In the works of Frank Hals the portrait painter may observe the\ncomposition of a face, the features well put together as the\npainters express it, from whence proceeds that strong marked\ncharacter of individual nature which is so remarkable in his\nportraits, and is not to be found in an equal degree in any other\npainter.  If he had joined to this most difficult part of the art a\npatience in finishing what he had so correctly planned, he might\njustly have claimed the place which Vandyke, all things considered,\nso justly holds as the first of portrait painters.",
        "Others of the same school have shown great power in expressing the\ncharacter and passions of those vulgar people which are the\nsubjects of their study and attention.  Amongst those, Jean Stein\nseems to be one of the most diligent and accurate observers of what\npassed in those scenes which he frequented, and which were to him\nan academy.  I can easily imagine that if this extraordinary man\nhad had the good fortune to have been born in Italy instead of\nHolland, had he lived in Rome instead of Leyden, and had been\nblessed with Michael Angelo and Raffaelle for his masters instead\nof Brower and Van Gowen, that the same sagacity and penetration\nwhich distinguished so accurately the different characters and\nexpression in his vulgar figures, would, when exerted in the\nselection and imitation of what was great and elevated in nature,\nhave been equally successful, and his name would have been now\nranged with the great pillars and supporters of our art.",
        "Men who, although thus bound down by the almost invincible powers\nof early habits, have still exerted extraordinary abilities within\ntheir narrow and confined circle, and have, from the natural vigour\nof their mind, given such an interesting expression, such force and\nenergy to their works, though they cannot be recommended to be\nexactly imitated, may yet invite an artist to endeavour to\ntransfer, by a kind of parody, those excellences to his own works.\nWhoever has acquired the power of making this use of the Flemish,\nVenetian, and French schools is a real genius, and has sources of\nknowledge open to him which were wanting to the great artists who\nlived in the great age of painting.",
        "To find excellences however dispersed, to discover beauties however\nconcealed by the multitude of defects with which they are\nsurrounded, can be the work only of him who, having a mind always\nalive to his art, has extended his views to all ages and to all\nschools, and has acquired from that comprehensive mass which he has\nthus gathered to himself, a well digested and perfect idea of his\nart, to which everything is referred.  Like a sovereign judge and\narbiter of art, he is possessed of that presiding power which\nseparates and attracts every excellence from every school, selects\nboth from what is great and what is little, brings home knowledge\nfrom the east and from the west, making the universe tributary\ntowards furnishing his mind and enriching his works with\noriginality and variety of inventions.",
        "Thus I have ventured to give my opinion of what appears to me the\ntrue and only method by which an artist makes himself master of his\nprofession, which I hold ought to be one continued course of\nimitation, that is not to cease but with our lives.",
        "Those who, either from their own engagements and hurry of business,\nor from indolence, or from conceit and vanity, have neglected\nlooking out of themselves, as far as my experience and observation\nreaches, have from that time not only ceased to advance and improve\nin their performance, but have gone backward.  They may be compared\nto men who have lived upon their principal till they are reduced to\nbeggary and left without resources.",
        "I can recommend nothing better, therefore, than that you endeavour\nto infuse into your works what you learn from the contemplation of\nthe works of others.  To recommend this has the appearance of\nneedless and superfluous advice, but it has fallen within my own\nknowledge that artists, though they are not wanting in a sincere\nlove for their art, though they have great pleasure in seeing good\npictures, and are well skilled to distinguish what is excellent or\ndefective in them, yet go on in their own manner, without any\nendeavour to give a little of those beauties which they admire in\nothers, to their own works.  It is difficult to conceive how the\npresent Italian painters, who live in the midst of the treasures of\nart, should be contented with their own style.  They proceed in\ntheir common-place inventions, and never think it worth while to\nvisit the works of those great artists with which they are\nsurrounded.",
        "I remember several years ago to have conversed at Rome with an\nartist of great fame throughout Europe; he was not without a\nconsiderable degree of abilities, but those abilities were by no\nmeans equal to his own opinion of them.  From the reputation he had\nacquired he too fondly concluded that he stood in the same rank,\nwhen compared to his predecessors, as he held with regard to his\nmiserable contemporary rivals.",
        "In conversation about some particulars of the works of Raffaelle,\nhe seemed to have, or to affect to have, a very obscure memory of\nthem.  He told me that he had not set his foot in the Vatican for\nfifteen years together; that indeed he had been in treaty to copy a\ncapital picture of Raffaelle, but that the business had gone off;\nhowever, if the agreement had held, his copy would have greatly\nexceeded the original.  The merit of this artist, however great we\nmay suppose it, I am sure would have been far greater, and his\npresumption would have been far less if he had visited the Vatican,\nas in reason he ought to have done, once at least every month of\nhis life.",
        "I address myself, gentlemen, to you who have made some progress in\nthe art, and are to be for the future under the guidance of your\nown judgment and discretion",
        "I consider you as arrived to that period when you have a right to\nthink for yourselves, and to presume that every man is fallible; to\nstudy the masters with a suspicion that great men are not always\nexempt from great faults; to criticise, compare, and rank their\nworks in your own estimation, as they approach to or recede from\nthat standard of perfection which you have formed in your own mind,\nbut which those masters themselves, it must be remembered, have\ntaught you to make, and which you will cease to make with\ncorrectness when you cease to study them.  It is their excellences\nwhich have taught you their defects.",
        "I would wish you to forget where you are, and who it is that speaks\nto you.  I only direct you to higher models and better advisers.\nWe can teach you here but very little; you are henceforth to be\nyour own teachers.  Do this justice, however, to the English\nAcademy, to bear in mind, that in this place you contracted no\nnarrow habits, no false ideas, nothing that could lead you to the\nimitation of any living master, who may be the fashionable darling\nof the day.  As you have not been taught to flatter us, do not\nlearn to flatter yourselves.  We have endeavoured to lead you to\nthe admiration of nothing but what is truly admirable.  If you\nchoose inferior patterns, or if you make your own FORMER works,\nyour patterns for your LATTER, it is your own fault.",
        "The purpose of this discourse, and, indeed, of most of my others,\nis to caution you against that false opinion, but too prevalent\namongst artists, of the imaginary power of native genius, and its\nsufficiency in great works.  This opinion, according to the temper\nof mind it meets with, almost always produces, either a vain\nconfidence, or a sluggish despair, both equally fatal to all\nproficiency.",
        "Study, therefore, the great works of the great masters for ever.\nStudy as nearly as you can, in the order, in the manner, on the\nprinciples, on which they studied.  Study nature attentively, but\nalways with those masters in your company; consider them as models\nwhich you are to imitate, and at the same time as rivals which you\nare to combat.",
