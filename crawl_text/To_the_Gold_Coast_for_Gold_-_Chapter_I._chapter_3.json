        "PRELIMINARY: TRIESTE TO LISBON.",
        "The glory of an explorer, I need hardly say, results not so much from\nthe extent, or the marvels of his explorations, as from the consequences\nto which they lead.  Judged by this test, my little list of discoveries\nhas not been unfavoured of fortune. Where two purblind fever-stricken\nmen plodded painfully through fetid swamp and fiery thorn-bush over the\nZanzibar-Tanganyika track, mission-houses and schools may now be\nnumbered by the dozen. Missionaries bring consuls, and consuls bring\ncommerce and colonisation. On the Gold Coast of Western Africa, whence\ncame the good old ’guinea,’ not a washing-cradle, not a pound of\nquicksilver was to be found in 1862; in 1882 five mining companies are\nat work; and in 1892 there will be as many score.",
        "I had long and curiously watched from afar the movement of the Golden\nLand, our long-neglected El Dorado, before the opportunity of a revisit\npresented itself. At last, in the autumn of 1881, Mr. James Irvine, of\nLiverpool, formerly of the West African ’Oil-rivers,’ and now a large\nmine-owner in the Gulf of Guinea, proposed to me a tour with the object\nof inspecting his concessions, and I proposed to myself a journey of\nexploration inland. The Foreign Office liberally gave me leave to escape\nthe winter of Trieste, where the ferocious Bora (nor’-nor’-easter) wages\neternal war with the depressing and distressing Scirocco, or\nsouth-easter. Some One marvelled aloud and said, ’You are certainly the\nfirst that ever applied to seek health in the “genial and congenial\nclimate” of the West African Coast.’ But then Some One had not realised\nthe horrors of January and February at the storm-beaten head of the ever\nunquiet Adriatic.",
        "Thus it happened that on November 18,1881, after many adieux and au\nrevoirs, I found myself on board the Cunard s.s. Demerara\n(Captain C. Jones), bound for ’Gib.’ My wife was to accompany me as far\nas Hungarian Fiume.",
        "The Cunard route to ’Gib’ is decidedly roundabout. We began with a run\nto Venice, usually six hours from the Vice-Queen of the Adriatic: it was\nprolonged to double by the thick and clinging mist-fog. The sea-city was\nenjoying her usual lethargy of repose after the excitement of the\n’geographical Carnival,’ as we called the farcical Congress of last\nSeptember. She is essentially a summering place. Her winter is\nmiserable, neither city nor houses being built for any but the finest of\nfine weather; her ’society’-season lasts only four months from\nSt. Stephen’s Day; her traveller-seasons are spring and autumn. We found\nall our friends either in bed with bad colds, or on the wing for England\nand elsewhere; we inhaled a quant. suff. of choking vapour, even\nin the comfortable Britannia Hotel; and, on the morning of the 23rd, we\nawoke to find ourselves moored alongside of the new warehouses on the\nnew port of Hungarian, or rather Croatian, Fiume.",
        "Fiume had made prodigious strides since I last saw her in 1878; and she\nis gradually taking the wind out of the sails of her sister-rival. While\nold Tergeste wastes time and trouble upon futile questions of policy,\nand angry contrasts between Germans and Slavs, and Italians and\nTriestines, Fiume looks to the main chance. The neat, clean, and\nwell-watered little harbour-city may be called a two-dinner-a-day place,\nso profuse is her hospitality to strangers. Here, too, we once more\nenjoyed her glorious outlook, the warm winter sun gilding the\nsnowy-silvery head of Monte Maggiore and raining light and life upon the\nindigo-tinted waters of Fiume Bay. Next to Naples, I know nothing in\nEurope more beautiful than this ill-named Quarnero. We saw a shot or so\nof the far-famed Whitehead torpedo, which now makes twenty-one miles an\nhour; and on Nov. 25 we began to run down the Gulf en route for\nPatras.",
        "It was a pleasure to emerge from the stern and gloomy Adriatic; and\nnothing could be more lovely than the first evening amongst the Ionian\nIslands. To port, backed by the bold heights of the Grecian sea-range,\nlay the hoary mount, and the red cliffs, 780 feet high, of Sappho’s\nLeap, a never-forgotten memory. Starboard rose bleak Ithaca, fronting\nthe black mountain of Cephalonia, now bald and bare, but clothed with\ndark forests till these were burnt down by some mischievous\nmalignant. Whatever of sterility deformed the scene lay robed under a\nglory of colour painted with perfect beauty by the last smile of the\nsun. Earth and air and sea showed every variety of the chromatic scale,\nespecially of rose-tints, from the tenderest morning blush of virgin\nsnow to the vinous evening flush upon the lowlands washed by the purple\nwave. The pure translucent vault never ceased to shift its\nchameleon-like hues, that ranged between the diaphanous azure of the\nzenith and the faintest rainbow green, a border-land where blue and\nyellow met and parted. The air felt soft and balmy; a holy calm was on\nthe face of creation; all looked delicious after the rude north, and we\nacknowledged once more that life was worth living.",
        "Patras also has greatly improved since I last saw her in 1872. The\nmalaria-swamps to the north and south of the town have been drained and\nare being warped up: the ’never-failing succession of aguish fevers’\nwill presently fade out of the guide-books. A macadamised boulevard has\nbeen built, and a breakwater is building. The once desert square,\n’Georgios A’,’ has been planted with trees, which should be Eucalyptus;\nand adorned with two French statues of bronze which harmonise admirably\nwith the surroundings. The thoroughfares are still Sloughs of Despond\nafter rain, and gridirons of St. Laurence in dusty summer; but there are\nincipient symptoms of trottoirs. And throughout there is a disappearance\nof the hovels which resembled Port Sa’id in her younger day, and a\nnotable substitution of tall solid houses.",
        "All this has been brought about by ’fruit,’ which in Patras means\ncurrants; that is, ’Corinthian grapes.’ The export this year is unusual,\n110,000 tons, including the Morea and the Islands; and of this total\nonly 20,000 go to France for wine-making. It gives a surprising idea of\nthe Christmas plum-pudding manufacture. Patras also imports for all the\nsmall adjacent places, inhabited by ’shaggy capotes.’ And she will have\na fine time when that talented and energetic soldier, General Türr, whom\nwe last met at Venice, begins the ’piercing of the Isthmus.’ À\npropos of which, one might suggest to Patras, with due respect, that\n(politically speaking) ’honesty is the best policy.’",
        "Being at Patras on St. Andrew’s Day, with a Scotch demoiselle on board,\nwe could hardly but pilgrimage to the place of the Apostle’s\nmartyrdom. Mrs. Wood kindly sent her daughters to do the honours.\nAghyos Andreas lies at the extreme south of the town on the system of\nruts, called a road, which conducts down-coast. The church is a long\nyellow barn, fronting a cypress-grown cemetery, whose contents are being\ntransferred to the new extramural. A little finger of the holy man\nreposes under a dwarf canopy in the south-eastern angle: his left arm is\npreserved at Mount Athos in a silver reliquary, set with gems. Outside,\nnear the south-western corner, is the old well of Demeter (Ceres), which\nhas not lost its curative virtues by being baptised. You descend a dwarf\nflight of brick steps to a mean shrine and portrait of the saint, and\nremark the solid bases and the rude rubble arch of the pagan temple. A\nfig-tree, under which the martyrdom took place, grew in the adjacent\ncourt; it has long been cut down, probably for fuel.",
        "The population of Patras still affords a fine study of the ’dirty\npicturesque,’ with clothes mostly home-made; sheepskin cloaks;\nfustanellas or kilts, which contain a whole piece of calico; red\nleggings, and the rudest of sandals; Turkish caps, and an occasional\npistol-belt. The Palikar still struts about in all his old bravery; and\nthe bourgeois humbly imitates the dingy garb of Southern\nItaly. The people have no taste for music, no regard for art, no respect\nfor antiquities, except for just as much as these will bring. They own\ntwo, and only two, objects in life: firstly, to make money, and\nsecondly, to keep and not to spend it. But this dark picture has a\nbright side. No race that I know is so greedy of education; the small\nboys, instead of wending unwillingly to school, crowd the doors before\nthey are opened. Where this exceptional feeling is universal we may hope\nfor much.",
        "The last evening at Patras showed us a beautiful view of what is here\ncalled Parnassus (Parnassó), the tall bluff mountain up the Gulf, whose\nsnows at sunset glowed like a balass ruby. We left the Morea at 2\nA.M. (December 2), and covered the fifty-two miles to Zante before\nbreakfast. There is, and ever has been, something peculiarly sympathetic\nto me in the ’flower of the Levant.’ ’Eh! ’tis a bonny, bonny place,’\nrepeatedly ejaculated our demoiselle. The city lies at the foot of the\ngrey cliffs, whose northern prolongation extends to the Akroteri, or\nLighthouse Point. A fine quay, the Strada Marina, has been opened during\nthe last six years along the northern sea-front, where the arcades\nsuggest those of Chester. It is being prolonged southwards to the old\nquarantine-ground and the modern prison, which rests upon the skirts of\nthe remarkable Skopo, the Prospect Mountain, 1,489 feet high. This\nfeature, which first shows itself to mariners approaching Zakynthos from\nnorth or from south, has a saddle-back sky-line, with a knob of\nlimestone shaped like a Turkish pommel and sheltering its monastery,\nPanaghia of Skopo, alias Our Lady of the Look-out. Below it appears\nanother and a similar outcrop near a white patch which has suggested\nmarble-quarrying; and the northern flank is dotted with farmhouses and\nvillas. The dwarf breakwater, so easily prolonged over the shallows, has\nnot been improved; but at its base rises a brand-new opera-house, big\nenough for a first-rate city. Similarly at Barletta they raised a loan\nto build a mole and they built a theatre. Unlike Patras, Zante long had\nthe advantage of Italian and then of English rule; and the citizens care\nfor music more than for transformation-scenes. The Palikar element also\nis notably absent; and the soldiers are in uniform, not in half-uniform\nand half-brigand attire. I missed the British flag once so conspicuous\nupon the southern round tower of the castle, where in days, or rather\nnights, of old I had spent not a few jolly hours; but I heard with\npleasure that it is proposed to make a haute-ville of the now\ndeserted and crumbling triangle, a Sommerfrisch where the\nparboiled citizens of Athens will find a splendid prospect and a cooling\nsea-breeze.",
        "Mr. E. Barff kindly accompanied us in the usual drive ’round the\nWrekin,’ for which we may here read the ’wreck.’ We set out along the\nsea-flank of the Castle hill. This formation, once a regular hog’s-back,\nhas been split by weather about the middle; and its southern end has\nbeen shaken down by earthquakes, and carved by wind and rain into\nprecipices and pinnacles of crumbling sandstone, which form the ’Grey\nCliffs.’ Having heard at Patras the worst accounts of Zante since it\npassed under Greek rule, I was not a little surprised by the excellent\ncondition of the roads and the general look of prosperity.",
        "Turning to the right we entered Mr. Barff’s garden-house, where the\ngrounds were bright and beautiful with balsam and mignonette, dahlias\nand cyclamens, chrysanthemums and oleanders, jasmine and double-violets,\norange-blossoms, and a perfect Gulistan of roses, roses of York and\nLancaster, white, pink, and purple, yellow and green–a perfumed spring\nin dreary December. Laden with bouquets we again threaded the\nolive-grounds, whose huge trunks are truly patriarchal, and saw basking\nin the sun old Eumæus, the Swine-King, waiting upon his black and\nbristly herd. The glimpse led to a characteristic tale. A wealthy Greek\nmerchant in London had made the most liberal offers to his brother, a\nshepherd in the hills of Cephalonia; the latter returned his very best\nthanks, but declared himself perfectly happy and unwilling to tempt\nfortune by change of condition to England. Greece, it is evident, has\nnot ceased to breed ’wise men.’",
        "We returned, viâ the landward flank of the hog’s-back, along the\nfine plain (’O Kampos’) bounded west by the range called after Mount\nMeriy, the apex, rising 3,274 feet. Anglo-Zantiots fondly compare its\noutline with the Jura’s. The look of the rich lowlands, ’the vale,’ as\nour charts call it, suggested a river-valley, but river there is\nnone. Every nook and corner was under cultivation, and each\ncountry-house had its chapel and its drying-ground for ’fruit,’ level\nyards now hidden under large-leaved daisies and wild flowers. We passed\nthrough the Graetani village, whose tenants bear a bad name, and saw\nnone of the pretty faces for which Zante is famed. The sex was dressed\nin dark jackets and petticoats à l’italienne; and the elders were\napparently employed in gathering ’bitter herbs,’ dandelion and the wild\nendive. Verily this is a frugal race.",
        "The drive ended with passing up the Strada Larga, the inner High Street,\nrunning parallel with the Marina. After Turkish fashion, trades flock\ntogether, shoemakers to the south and vegetable-vendors to the\nnorth. There are two good specimens of Venetian palazzetti, one\nfantastic, the other classical; and there is a rough pavement, which is\nstill wanting in Patras. A visit to the silk-shop of Garafuglia\nPapaiouanou was obligatory: here the golden-hued threads reminded me of\nthe Indian Tussur-moth. Also de rigueur was the purchase of nougat\nand raki, the local mandorlato and mastaché, almond-cake and\ngrape-spirit.",
        "Zante appears to me an excellent home for a large family with a small\nincome. A single man lives at the best hotel (Nazionale) for forty-five\nfrancs per week. A country-house with nine bedrooms, cellarage,\nstabling, dog-house, orangery, and large garden, is to be had for\n25l. a year. Fowls cost less than a franc; turkeys, if you do not\nbuy them from a shipchandler, two francs and a half. The strong and\nsherry-flavoured white wine of Zante rarely exceeds three shillings the\ngallon, sixpence a bottle. And other necessaries in the same proportion.",
        "But, oh that St. Dionysius, patron saint of Zante, would teach his\nprotégés a little of that old Persian wisdom which abhorred a lie\nand its concomitants, cheating and mean trickery! The Esmeralda,\nafter two days and one night at Zante, was charged 15l., for\npilotage, when the captain piloted himself; for church, where there is\nno parson; and for harbour dues where there is no harbour. It is almost\nincredible that so sharp-witted a race can also be so short-sighted; so\nwise about pennies, so foolish about pounds.",
        "On Saturday we left Zante in the teeth of a fresh but purely local\nnorth-easter, which whistled through the gear and hurled the spray high\nup Cape Skinari. The result was, as the poet sings–",
        "  That peculiar up-and-down motion\n  Which belongs to the treacherous ocean.",
        "Not without regret I saw the last of the memorious old castle and of\nSkopo the picturesque. We ran along the western shore of Cephalonia, the\nisle of three hundred villages: anyone passing this coast at once\nunderstands how Greece produced so many and such excellent seamen. The\nisland was a charming spectacle, with its two culminations, Maraviglia\n(3,311 ft.) and Elato (5,246 ft.), both capped by purple cloud; its\nfertile slopes and its fissured bight, Argostoli Bay, running deep into\nthe land.",
        "We fondly expected to pass the Messina Straits by daylight, and to cast\nanother glance upon old Etna, Scylla and Charybdis, the Liparis and\nStromboli. And all looked well, as about noon we were abreast of Cape\nSpartivento, the ’Split-wind’ which divides the mild northers and\nsouthers of the Straits from the raw Boras and rotting Sciroccos of the\nAdriatic. But presently a signal for succour was hoisted by a marvellous\nold tub, a sailer-made-steamer, sans boats, sans gunwales; a something\nwhose dirt and general dilapidation suggested the Flying Dutchman. I\nalmost expected to see her drop out of form and crumble into dust as our\nboys boarded her. The America, of Barletta, bound from Brindisi\nto Genoa, had hurt her boilers. We hauled in her cable–these gentry\nmust never be trusted with a chance of slipping loose–and tugged her\ninto Messina, thereby losing a valuable day.",
        "The famous Straits were almost a replica of Ionian Island scenery: the\nshores of the Mediterranean, limestone and sandstone, with here and\nthere a volcanic patch, continually repeat themselves. After passing the\nbarren heel of the Boot and its stony big toe, the wady-streaked shores\nbecome populous and well cultivated, while railway trains on either\nside, island and continent, toss their snowy plumes in the pride of\ncivilisation. The ruined castles on the crags and the new villages on\nthe lowlands told their own story of Turkish and Algerine piracy, now\ndoomed to the limbo of things that were. In the evening we were safely\nanchored within the zancle (sickle) of Messina-port, whose depth of\nwater and circular shape have suggested an old crater flooded. It was\nSunday, and we were greeted with the familiar sounds, the ringing of\ncracked bells, the screaming of harsh, hoarse voices, a military band\nand detached musical performances. The classical facade of the Marina,\nthrough whose nineteen archways and upper parallelograms you catch a\nvista of dark narrow wynd, contrasts curiously with Catania: the former\nis a ’dicky,’ a front hiding something unclean; while the latter is laid\nout in Eastern style, where, for the best of reasons, the marble palace\nhides behind a wall of mud. The only new features I noted were a metal\nfish-market, engineer art which contrasts marvellously with the Ionic\npilasters and the solid ashlar of the ’dicky;’ and, at the root of the\nsickle, a new custom-house of six detached boxes, reddest-roofed and\nwhitest-walled, built to copy children’s toy cottages. Croatian Fiume\nwould blush to own them. Of the general impurity of the town and of the\nbouquet de Messine the less said the better.",
        "As we made fast to the Marina our tobacco was temporarily sealed after\nthe usual mean Italian fashion. Next morning an absurd old person, in a\nbroad red baldrick, came on board and counted noses, to ascertain that\nwe had not brought the dreaded small-pox from the Ionian Islands. After\nbeing graciously and liberally allowed to land, we were visited by the\nlocal chapmen, whose goods appeared rather mixed–polished cowhorns and\nmildewed figs, dolls in costume and corrosive oranges; by the normal\nmusical barber, who imitates at a humble distance bird and beast; and by\nthe vendor of binoculars, who asks forty francs and who takes ten. The\ncaptain noted his protest at the Consulate, and claimed by way of\nsauvetage 200l. The owners offered 200 lire–punds Scots. Briefly,\nnoon had struck before we passed out of the noise and the smells of\nMessina.",
        "Our good deed had cost us dear. A wet scirocco had replaced the bright\nnorther and saddened all the view. Passing the tide-rip Charybdis, a\nmeeting of currents, which called only for another hand at the wheel;\nand the castled crag of naughty Scylla, whose town has grown\nprodigiously, we bade adieu to the ’tower of Pelorus.’ Then we shaped\nour course for the Islands of Æolus, or the Winds, and the Lipari\narchipelago, all volcanic cones whose outlines were misty as Ossian’s\nspectres. And we plodded through the dreary dull-grey scene of drizzling\nscirocco–",
        "  Till, when all veilèd sank in darkling air,\n  Naught but the welkin and the wave was there.",
        "Next morning showed us to port the Cone of Maritimo: it outlies Marsala,\nwhose wine caused the blinding of Polyphemus, and since that time has\nbrought on many an attack of liver. The world then became to us\npontus et aer. Days and nights were equally uneventful; the diary\ntells only of quiet seas under the lee of Sardinia and of the Balearics,\nghostly glimpses of the North African coast and the steady setting in of\nthe normal wester, the indraught of ’the Straits.’",
        "On Friday (November 9) the weather broke and deluged us with rain. At\nGibraltar the downpour lasted twenty-four hours. We found ourselves at\nanchor before midnight with a very low barometer, which suggested\nunpleasantries. Next morning we sighted the deep blue waters of the Bay,\nand the shallow brown waters of the Bayside crested with foam by a\nfurious norther, that had powdered the far Ronda highlands with\nsnow. Before noon, however, the gale had abated and allowed me to\ntransfer myself and African outfit on board the Fez (Capt. Hay),\nMoroccan Steamship Company, trading to North Africa. This was a\ngodsend: there is no regular line between Gibraltar and Lisbon, and one\nmight easily be delayed for a week.",
        "The few hours’ halt allowed me time to call upon my old friend,\nM. Dautez, a Belgian artist. Apparently he is the only person in the\nplace who cares for science. He has made extensive collections. He owns\ntwenty-four coins from Carteia, whereas Florez (Medallas, Madrid, 1773)\nshows a total of only thirty-three. Amongst his antiquities there is a\ncharming statuette of Minerva, a bronze miniature admirably finished. He\nhas collected the rock fauna, especially the molluscs, fossil and\nmodern. He is preparing an album of the Flora Calpensis. His birds’\nnests were lately sold to an Englishman. All these objects, of immense\nlocal interest, were offered by him at the lowest possible rate to the\nMilitary Library, but who is there to understand their value? I wonder\nhow many Englishmen on the Rock know that they are within easy ride of\nthe harbour which named the ’Ships of Tarshish’? Tartessus, which was\nCarteia, although certain German geographers would, against the general\nvoice of antiquity, make the former the country and the latter the city,\nlay on both sides of the little Guadarranque stream, generally called\nFirst River; and the row of tumuli on the left bank probably denotes the\nsite of the famous docks. I was anxious to open diggings in 1872, but\npermission was not forthcoming: now, however, they say that the Duke of\nMedina Sidonia would offer no objections.",
        "Gib, though barbarous in matters of science, is civilised as regards\n’business.’ It was a treat to see steamer after steamer puff in, load up\nwith blue peter at the fore, and start off after a few hours which would\nhave been days at Patras, Zante, and Messina. Here men work with a will,\nas a walk from the Convent to the Old Mole, the Mersa or water-port of a\nMoroccan town, amply proves. The uniforms are neat and natty–they were\nthe reverse five years ago–and it is a pleasure to look upon the fresh\nfaces of English girls still unstained by unconsumed carbon. And the\nauthorities have had the good sense to preserve the old Moorish town of\nTárik and his successors, the triangle of walls with the tall tower-like\nmosque for apex, and the base facing the bay.",
        "We left Gibraltar at 5 P.M. on Saturday (December 10), giving a wide\nberth to the hated Pearl Rock, which skippers would remove by force of\narms. Seen from east or west Gib has an outline of its own. The\nBritisher, whose pride it is, sees the ’lion of England who has laid his\npaw upon the key of the Mediterranean,’ and compares it with the king of\nbeasts, sejant, the tail being Europa Point. The Spaniards, to whom it\nis an eyesore, liken it to a shrouded corpse, the outlined head lying to\nthe north, and declare, truly enough, that to them it is a dead body.",
        "The norther presently changed to the rainy south-wester, the builder of\nthe Moroccan ’bars’ and the scourge of the coast fringing North-west\nAfrica, Rolling set in with the usual liveliness. Events were not\neventful. The first midnight found us off Cape Trafalgar, and the second\noff St. Vincent. At 4 P.M. (December 12), we saw the light of Espíchel\n(Promóntorium Barbaricum), the last that shines upon the voyager\nbound Brazilwards. Before nightfall we had left Buzio lighthouse to\nstarboard. We then ran up the northern passage in charge of a lagging\npilot; and, as the lamps were lighting, we found ourselves comfortably\nberthed off that pretty toy, Belem Tower.",
        "Next morning broke upon a lovely view: no wonder that the Tagus is the\npride of Portuguese bards. The Rosicler, or rosy dawn-light, was\nthat of a May morning–the May of poetry, not of meteorology–and the\nupper windows of distant Lisbon were all ablaze with the unrisen sun. It\nwas a picture for the loveliest colours, not for ’word-painting;’ and\nthe whole scene was classical as picturesque. We may justly say of it,\n’Nullum sine nomine saxum.’ Far over the rising hills of the north bank\nrose shaggy Cintra, ’the most blessed spot in the habitable globe,’ with\nits memorious convent and its Moorish castle. The nearer heights were\nstudded with the oldest-fashioned windmills, when the newest are found\neven in the Canaries; a single crest bore its baker’s dozen, mostly\ndecapitated by steam. Advancing we remarked the glorious Belem\nmonastery, defiled by its ignoble modern ruin to the west; the new\nhippodrome crowning the grassy slope; the Bed House of Belem, now being\nbrightened up for Royal residence during the Exhibition of 1882; the\nMemoria and the Ajuda Palace, more unfinished, if possible, than\never. As we approached the bulk of the city the marking objects were the\ncypressed Prazeres Cemetery; the red Necessidades Palace, and the\nEstrella, whose dome and domelets, built to mimic St. Peter’s, look only\nlike hen and chickens. Then in due time came the Carmo Church, still\nunrepaired since 1755; Blackhorse Square, still bare of trees; the\nGovernment offices, still propped to prevent a tumble-down, and the old\nCustom House, still a bilious yellow; the vast barrack-like pile of\nS. Vicente, the historic Sé or cathedral with dumpy towers; the\nblack Castle of São Jorge, so hardly wrung from the gallant Moors, and\nthe huge Santa Engracia, apparently ever to be a ruin.",
        "I spent a pleasant week at Lisbon, and had a fair opportunity of\nmeasuring what progress she has made during the last sixteen years. We\nhave no longer to wander up and down disconsolate",
        "  Mid many things unsightly to strange ee.",
        "If the beggars remain, the excessive dirt and the vagrant dogs have\ndisappeared. The Tagus has a fine embankment; but the land side is\noccupied by mean warehouses. The sewers, like those of Trieste, still\nwant a cloaca maxama, a general conduit of masonry running along\nthe quay down-stream. The Rocio has been planted with mean trees,\ngreatly to the disgust of the average Lusitanian, who hates such\nsun-excluding vegetation like a backwoodsman; yet the Quintella\nsquarelet shows what fine use may be made of cactus and pandanus, aloes\nand palms, not to mention the ugly and useful eucalyptus. The\nthoroughfares are far cleaner than they were; and Lisbon is now\nsurrounded by good roads. The new houses are built with some respect for\narchitectonic effect of light and shade: such fine old streets as the\nRua Augusta offend the eye by façades flat as cards with rows of pips\nfor windows. Finally, a new park is being laid out to the north of the\nPasseio Publico.",
        "Having always found ’Olisipo’ exceptionally hospitable and pleasant, I\nlook forward to the days when she will be connected with Paris by direct\nrailway. Her hotels are first-rate; her prices are not excessive; her\nwinter climate is delightful, and she is the centre of most charming\nexcursions. The capital has thrown off much of her old lethargy. Her\nGeographical Society is doing hard and honest work; she has nobly\nexpiated the national crime by becoming a ’Camonian’ city; and she\nindulges freely in exhibitions. One, of Ornamental Art, was about to be\nopened when I last saw her, and it extended deep into the next spring.",
