        "IN REFERENCE TO M. MICHELET’S HISTORY OF FRANCE.",
        "What is to be thought of her? What is to be thought of the poor shepherd\ngirl from the hills and forests of Lorraine, that–like the Hebrew shepherd\nboy from the hills and forests of Judæa–rose suddenly out of the quiet,\nout of the safety, out of the religious inspiration, rooted in deep\npastoral solitudes, to a station in the van of armies, and to the more\nperilous station at the right hand of kings? The Hebrew boy inaugurated his\npatriotic mission by an act, by a victorious act, such as no man could\ndeny. But so did the girl of Lorraine, if we read her story as it was read\nby those who saw her nearest. Adverse armies bore witness to the boy as no\npretender: but so they did to the gentle girl. Judged by the voices of all\nwho saw them from a station of good will, both were found true and loyal\nto any promises involved in their first acts. Enemies it was that made the\ndifference between their subsequent fortunes. The boy rose–to a splendor\nand a noon-day prosperity, both personal and public, that rang through the\nrecords of his people, and became a byeword amongst his posterity for a\nthousand years, until the sceptre was departing from Judah. The poor,\nforsaken girl, on the contrary, drank not herself from that cup of rest\nwhich she had secured for France. She never sang together with the songs\nthat rose in her native Domrémy, as echoes to the departing steps of\ninvaders. She mingled not in the festal dances at Vaucouleurs which\ncelebrated in rapture the redemption of France. No! for her voice was then\nsilent: No! for her feet were dust. Pure, innocent, noble-hearted girl!\nwhom, from earliest youth, ever I believed in as full of truth and\nself-sacrifice, this was amongst the strongest pledges for thy side,\nthat never once–no, not for a moment of weakness–didst thou revel in the\nvision of coronets and honor from man. Coronets for thee! O no! Honors, if\nthey come when all is over, are for those that share thy blood.[2] Daughter\nof Domrémy, when the gratitude of thy king shall awaken, thou wilt be\nsleeping the sleep of the dead. Call her, King of France, but she will not\nhear thee! Cite her by thy apparitors to come and receive a robe of honor,\nbut she will be found en contumace. When the thunders of universal\nFrance, as even yet may happen, shall proclaim the grandeur of the poor\nshepherd girl that gave up all for her country–thy ear, young shepherd\ngirl, will have been deaf for five centuries. To suffer and to do, that was\nthy portion in this life; to do–never for thyself, always for others;\nto suffer–never in the persons of generous champions, always in thy\nown–that was thy destiny; and not for a moment was it hidden from thyself.\nLife, thou saidst, is short: and the sleep which is in the grave, is long!\nLet me use that life, so transitory, for the glory of those heavenly dreams\ndestined to comfort the sleep which is so long. This pure creature–pure\nfrom every suspicion of even a visionary self-interest, even as she was\npure in senses more obvious–never once did this holy child, as regarded\nherself, relax from her belief in the darkness that was travelling to meet\nher. She might not prefigure the very manner of her death; she saw not in\nvision, perhaps, the aërial altitude of the fiery scaffold, the spectators\nwithout end on every road pouring into Rouen as to a coronation, the\nsurging smoke, the volleying flames, the hostile faces all around, the\npitying eye that lurked but here and there until nature and imperishable\ntruth broke loose from artificial restraints; these might not be apparent\nthrough the mists of the hurrying future. But the voice that called her to\ndeath, that she heard for ever.",
        "Great was the throne of France even in those days, and great was he that\nsate upon it: but well Joanna knew that not the throne, nor he that sate\nupon it, was for her; but, on the contrary, that she was for them; not\nshe by them, but they by her, should rise from the dust. Gorgeous were\nthe lilies of France, and for centuries had the privilege to spread their\nbeauty over land and sea, until, in another century, the wrath of God and\nman combined to wither them; but well Joanna knew, early at Domrémy she had\nread that bitter truth, that the lilies of France would decorate no garland\nfor her. Flower nor bud, bell nor blossom, would ever bloom for her.",
        "But stop. What reason is there for taking up this subject of Joanna\nprecisely in this spring of 1847? Might it not have been left till the\nspring of 1947? or, perhaps, left till called for? Yes, but it is called\nfor; and clamorously. You are aware, reader, that amongst the many original\nthinkers, whom modern France has produced, one of the reputed leaders is M.\nMichelet. All these writers are of a revolutionary cast; not in a political\nsense merely, but in all senses; mad, oftentimes, as March hares; crazy\nwith the laughing-gas of recovered liberty; drunk with the wine-cup of\ntheir mighty Revolution, snorting, whinnying, throwing up their heels, like\nwild horses in the boundless pampas, and running races of defiance with\nsnipes, or with the winds, or with their own shadows, if they can find\nnothing else to challenge. Some time or other, I, that have leisure to\nread, may introduce you, that have not, to two or three dozen of these\nwriters; of whom I can assure you beforehand that they are often profound,\nand at intervals are even as impassioned as if they were come of our best\nEnglish blood, and sometimes (because it is not pleasant that people should\nbe too easy to understand) almost as obscure as if they had been suckled\nby transcendental German nurses. But now, confining our attention to M.\nMichelet–who is quite sufficient to lead a man into a gallop, requiring\ntwo relays, at least, of fresh readers,–we in England–who know him best\nby his worst book, the book against Priests, &c., which has been most\ncirculated–know him disadvantageously. That book is a rhapsody of\nincoherence. M. Michelet was light-headed, I believe, when he wrote it:\nand it is well that his keepers overtook him in time to intercept a second\npart. But his History of France is quite another thing. A man, in\nwhatsoever craft he sails, cannot stretch away out of sight when he is\nlinked to the windings of the shore by towing ropes of history. Facts, and\nthe consequences of facts, draw the writer back to the falconer’s lure from\nthe giddiest heights of speculation. Here, therefore–in his France,–if\nnot always free from flightiness, if now and then off like a rocket for\nan airy wheel in the clouds, M. Michelet, with natural politeness, never\nforgets that he has left a large audience waiting for him on earth, and\ngazing upwards in anxiety for his return: return, therefore, he does. But\nHistory, though clear of certain temptations in one direction, has separate\ndangers of its own. It is impossible so to write a History of France, or\nof England–works becoming every hour more indispensable to the\ninevitably-political man of this day–without perilous openings for\nassault. If I, for instance, on the part of England, should happen to turn\nmy labors into that channel, and (on the model of Lord Percy going to Chevy\nChase)–",
        "  ––\"A vow to God should make\n  My pleasure in the Michelet woods\n  Three summer days to take,”",
        "–probably from simple delirium, I might hunt M. Michelet into delirium\ntremens. Two strong angels stand by the side of History, whether French\nHistory or English, as heraldic supporters: the angel of Research on the\nleft hand, that must read millions of dusty parchments, and of pages\nblotted with lies; the angel of Meditation on the right hand, that must\ncleanse these lying records with fire, even as of old the draperies of\nasbestos were cleansed, and must quicken them into regenerated life.\nWillingly I acknowledge that no man will ever avoid innumerable errors of\ndetail: with so vast a compass of ground to traverse, this is impossible:\nbut such errors (though I have a bushel on hand, at M. Michelet’s service)\nare not the game I chase: it is the bitter and unfair spirit in which\nM. Michelet writes against England. Even that, after all, is but my\nsecondary object: the real one is Joanna, the Pucelle d’Orleans for\nherself.",
        "I am not going to write the History of La Pucelle: to do this, or even\ncircumstantially to report the history of her persecution and bitter death,\nof her struggle with false witnesses and with ensnaring judges, it would\nbe necessary to have before us all the documents, and, therefore, the\ncollection only now forthcoming in Paris. But my purpose is narrower.\nThere have been great thinkers, disdaining the careless judgments of\ncontemporaries, who have thrown themselves boldly on the judgment of a far\nposterity, that should have had time to review, to ponder, to compare.\nThere have been great actors on the stage of tragic humanity that might,\nwith the same depth of confidence, have appealed from the levity of\ncompatriot friends–too heartless for the sublime interest of their story,\nand too impatient for the labor of sifting its perplexities–to the\nmagnanimity and justice of enemies. To this class belongs the Maid of Arc.\nThe Romans were too faithful to the ideal of grandeur in themselves not\nto relent, after a generation or two, before the grandeur of Hannibal.\nMithridates–a more doubtful person–yet, merely for the magic perseverance\nof his indomitable malice, won from the same Romans the only real honor\nthat ever he received on earth. And we English have ever shown the same\nhomage to stubborn enmity. To work unflinchingly for the ruin of England;\nto say through life, by word and by deed–Delenda est Anglia Victrix!\nthat one purpose of malice, faithfully pursued, has quartered some people\nupon our national funds of homage as by a perpetual annuity. Better than an\ninheritance of service rendered to England herself, has sometimes proved\nthe most insane hatred to England. Hyder Ali, even his far inferior son\nTippoo, and Napoleon, have all benefited by this disposition amongst\nourselves to exaggerate the merit of diabolic enmity. Not one of these men\nwas ever capable, in a solitary instance, of praising an enemy–[what\ndo you say to that, reader?] and yet in their behalf, we consent to\nforget, not their crimes only, but (which is worse) their hideous bigotry\nand anti-magnanimous egotism; for nationality it was not. Suffrein, and\nsome half dozen of other French nautical heroes, because rightly they did\nus all the mischief they could, [which was really great] are names justly\nreverenced in England. On the same principle, La Pucelle d’Orleans, the\nvictorious enemy of England, has been destined to receive her deepest\ncommemoration from the magnanimous justice of Englishmen.",
        "Joanna, as we in England should call her, but, according to her own\nstatement, Jeanne (or, as M. Michelet asserts, Jean[3]) d’Arc, was born at\nDomrémy, a village on the marshes of Lorraine and Champagne, and dependent\nupon the town of Vaucouleurs. I have called her a Lorrainer, not simply\nbecause the word is prettier, but because Champagne too odiously reminds\nus English of what are for us imaginary wines, which, undoubtedly, La\nPucelle tasted as rarely as we English; we English, because the Champagne\nof London is chiefly grown in Devonshire; La Pucelle, because the\nChampagne of Champagne never, by any chance, flowed into the fountain of\nDomrémy, from which only she drank. M. Michelet will have her to be a\nChampenoise, and for no better reason than that she “took after her\nfather,” who happened to be a Champenoise. I am sure she did not: for\nher father was a filthy old fellow, whom I shall soon teach the judicious\nreader to hate. But, (says M. Michelet, arguing the case physiologically)\n“she had none of the Lorrainian asperity;” no, it seems she had only “the\ngentleness of Champagne, its simplicity mingled with sense and acuteness,\nas you find it in Joinville.” All these things she had; and she was worth a\nthousand Joinvilles, meaning either the prince so called, or the fine old\ncrusader. But still, though I love Joanna dearly, I cannot shut my eyes\nentirely to the Lorraine element of “asperity” in her nature. No; really\nnow, she must have had a shade of that, though very slightly developed–a\nmere soupçon, as French cooks express it in speaking of cayenne pepper,\nwhen she caused so many of our English throats to be cut. But could she do\nless? No; I always say so; but still you never saw a person kill even a\ntrout with a perfectly “Champagne” face of “gentleness and simplicity,\"\nthough, often, no doubt, with considerable “acuteness.” All your cooks and\nbutchers wear a Lorraine cast of expression.",
        "These disputes, however, turn on refinements too nice. Domrémy stood\nupon the frontiers; and, like other frontiers, produced a mixed race\nrepresenting the cis and the trans. A river (it is true) formed the\nboundary line at this point–the river Meuse; and that, in old days,\nmight have divided the populations; but in these days it did not–there\nwere bridges, there were ferries, and weddings crossed from the right bank\nto the left. Here lay two great roads, not so much for travellers, that\nwere few, as for armies that were too many by half. These two roads, one of\nwhich was the great high road between France and Germany, decussated at\nthis very point; which is a learned way of saying that they formed a St.\nAndrew’s cross, or letter X. I hope the compositor will choose a good large\nX, in which case the point of intersection, the locus of conflux for\nthese four diverging arms, will finish the reader’s geographical education,\nby showing him to a hair’s breadth where it was that Domrémy stood. These\nroads, so grandly situated, as great trunk arteries between two mighty\nrealms,[4] and haunted for ever by wars or rumors of wars, decussated (for\nanything I know to the contrary) absolutely under Joanna’s bed-room window;\none rolling away to the right, past Monsieur D’Arc’s old barn, and the\nother unaccountably preferring (but there’s no disputing about tastes) to\nsweep round that odious man’s odious pigstye to the left.",
        "Things being situated as is here laid down, viz. in respect of the\ndecussation, and in respect of Joanna’s bed-room; it follows that, if she\nhad dropped her glove by accident from her chamber window into the very\nbull’s eye of the target, in the centre of X, not one of several great\npotentates could (though all animated by the sincerest desires for the\npeace of Europe) have possibly come to any clear understanding on the\nquestion of whom the glove was meant for. Whence the candid reader\nperceives at once the necessity for at least four bloody wars. Falling\nindeed a little farther, as, for instance, into the pigstye, the glove\ncould not have furnished to the most peppery prince any shadow of excuse\nfor arming: he would not have had a leg to stand upon in taking such a\nperverse line of conduct. But, if it fell (as by the hypothesis it did)\ninto the one sole point of ground common to four kings, it is clear that,\ninstead of no leg to stand upon, eight separate legs would have had\nno ground to stand upon unless by treading on each other’s toes. The\nphilosopher, therefore, sees clearly the necessity of a war, and regrets\nthat sometimes nations do not wait for grounds of war so solid.",
        "In the circumstances supposed, though the four kings might be unable to\nsee their way clearly without the help of gunpowder to any decision upon\nJoanna’s intention, she–poor thing!–never could mistake her intentions\nfor a moment. All her love was for France; and, therefore, any glove\nshe might drop into the quadrivium must be wickedly missent by the\npost-office, if it found its way to any king but the king of France.",
        "On whatever side of the border chance had thrown Joanna, the same love to\nFrance would have been nurtured. For it is a strange fact, noticed by M.\nMichelet and others, that the Dukes of Bar and Lorraine had for generations\npursued the policy of eternal warfare with France on their own account, yet\nalso of eternal amity and league with France in case anybody else presumed\nto attack her. Let peace settle upon France, and before long you might rely\nupon seeing the little vixen Lorraine flying at the throat of France. Let\nFranco be assailed by a formidable enemy, and instantly you saw a Duke of\nLorraine or Bar insisting on having his throat cut in support of France;\nwhich favor accordingly was cheerfully granted to them in three great\nsuccessive battles by the English and by the Turkish sultan, viz., at\nCrécy, at Nicopolis, and at Agincourt.",
        "This sympathy with France during great eclipses, in those that during\nordinary seasons were always teasing her with brawls and guerilla inroads,\nstrengthened the natural piety to France of those that were confessedly\nthe children of her own house. The outposts of France, as one may call the\ngreat frontier provinces, were of all localities the most devoted to the\nFlours de Lys. To witness, at any great crisis, the generous devotion to\nthese lilies of the little fiery cousin that in gentler weather was for\never tilting at her breast, could not bin fan the zeal of the legitimate\ndaughter: whilst to occupy a post of honor on the frontiers against an old\nhereditary enemy of France, would naturally have stimulated this zeal by a\nsentiment of martial pride, had there even been no other stimulant to zeal\nby a sense of danger always threatening, and of hatred always smouldering.\nThat great four-headed road was a perpetual memento to patriotic ardor.\nTo say, this way lies the road to Paris–and that other way to\nAix-la-Chapelle, this to Prague, that to Vienna–nourished the warfare of\nthe heart by daily ministrations of sense. The eye that watched for the\ngleams of lance or helmet from the hostile frontier, the ear that listened\nfor the groaning of wheels, made the high road itself, with its relations\nto centres so remote, into a manual of patriotic enmity.",
        "The situation, therefore, locally of Joanna was full of profound\nsuggestions to a heart that listened for the stealthy steps of change and\nfear that too surely were in motion. But if the place were grand, the\ntimes, the burthen of the times, was far more so. The air overhead in its\nupper chambers were hurtling with the obscure sound; was dark with sullen\nfermenting of storms that had been gathering for a hundred and thirty\nyears. The battle of Agincourt in Joanna’s childhood had re-opened the\nwounds of France. Crécy and Poictiers, those withering overthrows for the\nchivalry of France, had been tranquillized by more than half a century; but\nthis resurrection of their trumpet wails made the whole series of battles\nand endless skirmishes take their stations as parts in one drama. The\ngraves that had closed sixty years ago, seemed to fly open in sympathy\nwith a sorrow that echoed their own. The monarchy of France labored in\nextremity, rocked and reeled like a ship fighting with the darkness of\nmonsoons. The madness of the poor king (Charles VI.) falling in at such a\ncrisis, like the case of women laboring in childbirth during the storming\nof a city, trebled the awfulness of the time. Even the wild story of\nthe incident which had immediately occasioned the explosion of this\nmadness–the case of a man unknown, gloomy, and perhaps maniacal himself,\ncoming out of a forest at noon-day, laying his hand upon the bridle of\nthe king’s horse, checking him for a moment to say, “Oh, King, thou art\nbetrayed,” and then vanishing no man knew whither, as he had appeared for\nno man knew what–fell in with the universal prostration of mind that laid\nFrance on her knees as before the slow unweaving of some ancient prophetic\ndoom. The famines, the extraordinary diseases, the insurrections of the\npeasantry up and down Europe, these were chords struck from the same\nmysterious harp; but these were transitory chords. There had been others\nof deeper and more sonorous sound. The termination of the Crusades, the\ndestruction of the Templars, the Papal interdicts, the tragedies caused or\nsuffered by the House of Anjou, by the Emperor–these were full of a more\npermanent significance; but since then the colossal figure of feudalism was\nseen standing as it were on tiptoe at Crécy for flight from earth: that was\na revolution unparalleled; yet that was a trifle by comparison with the\nmore fearful revolutions that were mining below the Church. By her own\ninternal schisms, by the abominable spectacle of a double Pope–so that no\nman, except through political bias, could even guess which was Heaven’s\nvicegerent, and which the creature of hell–she was already rehearsing, as\nin still earlier forms she had rehearsed, the first rent in her foundations\n(reserved for the coming century) which no man should ever heal.",
        "These were the loftiest peaks of the cloudland in the skies, that to the\nscientific gazer first caught the colors of the new morning in advance.\nBut the whole vast range alike of sweeping glooms overhead, dwelt upon all\nmeditative minds, even those that could not distinguish the altitudes nor\ndecipher the forms. It was, therefore, not her own age alone, as affected\nby its immediate calamities, that lay with such weight upon Joanna’s mind;\nbut her own age, as one section in a vast mysterious drama, unweaving\nthrough a century back, and drawing nearer continually to crisis after\ncrisis. Cataracts and rapids were heard roaring ahead; and signs were seen\nfar back, by help of old men’s memories, which answered secretly to signs\nnow coming forward on the eye, even as locks answer to keys. It was not\nwonderful that in such a haunted solitude, with such a haunted heart,\nJoanna should see angelic visions, and hear angelic voices. These voices\nwhispered to her the duty imposed upon herself, of delivering France. Five\nyears she listened to these monitory voices with internal struggles. At\nlength she could resist no longer. Doubt gave way; and she left her home in\norder to present herself at the Dauphin’s court.",
        "The education of this poor girl was mean according to the present standard:\nwas ineffably grand, according to a purer philosophic standard; and only\nnot good for our age, because for us it would be unattainable. She read\nnothing, for she could not read; but she had heard others read parts of the\nRoman martyrology. She wept in sympathy with the sad Misereres of the\nRomish chaunting; she rose to heaven with the glad triumphant Gloria in\nExcelcis: she drew her comfort and her vital strength from the rites of\nher church. But, next after these spiritual advantages, she owed most to\nthe advantages of her situation. The fountain of Domrémy was on the brink\nof a boundless forest; and it was haunted to that degree by fairies that\nthe parish priest (curé) was obliged to read mass there once a year, in\norder to keep them in any decent bounds. Fairies are important, even in a\nstatistical view; certain weeds mark poverty in the soil, fairies mark\nits solitude. As surely as the wolf retires before cities, does the fairy\nsequester herself from the haunts of licensed victuallers. A village is too\nmuch for her nervous delicacy: at most, she can tolerate a distant view\nof a hamlet. We may judge, therefore, by the uneasiness and extra trouble\nwhich they gave to the parson, in what strength the fairies mustered at\nDomrémy, and, by a satisfactory consequence, how thinly sown with men and\nwomen must have been that region even in its inhabited spots. But the\nforests of Domrémy–those were the glories of the land: for, in them abode\nmysterious powers and ancient secrets that towered into tragic strength.\n“Abbeys there were, and abbey windows, dim and dimly seen–as Moorish\ntemples of the Hindoos,” that exercised even princely power both in\nLorraine and in the German Diets. These had their sweet bells that pierced\nthe forests for many a league at matins or vespers, and each its own dreamy\nlegend. Few enough, and scattered enough, were these abbeys, in no degree\nto disturb the deep solitude of the region; many enough to spread a network\nor awning of Christian sanctity over what else might have seemed a heathen\nwilderness. This sort of religious talisman being secured, a man the most\nafraid of ghosts (like myself, suppose, or the reader) becomes armed into\ncourage to wander for days in their sylvan recesses. The mountains of the\nVosges on the eastern frontier of France, have never attracted much notice\nfrom Europe, except in 1813-14, for a few brief months, when they fell\nwithin Napoleon’s line of defence against the Allies. But they are\ninteresting for this, amongst other features–that they do not, like some\nloftier ranges, repel woods: the forests and they are on sociable terms.\nLive and let live is their motto. For this reason, in part, these tracts\nin Lorraine were a favorite hunting ground with the Carlovingian princes.\nAbout six hundred years before Joanna’s childhood, Charlemagne was known to\nhave hunted there. That, of itself, was a grand incident in the traditions\nof a forest or a chase. In these vast forests, also, were to be found (if\nthe race was not extinct) those mysterious fawns that tempted solitary\nhunters into visionary and perilous pursuits. Here was seen, at intervals,\nthat ancient stag who was already nine hundred years old, at the least, but\npossibly a hundred or two more, when met by Charlemagne; and the thing\nwas put beyond doubt by the inscription upon his golden collar. I believe\nCharlemagne knighted the stag; and, if ever he is met again by a king, he\nought to be made an earl–or, being upon the marches of France, a marquess.\nObserve, I don’t absolutely vouch for all these things: my own opinion\nvaries. On a fine breezy forenoon I am audaciously sceptical; but as\ntwilight sets in, my credulity becomes equal to anything that could be\ndesired. And I have heard candid sportsmen declare that, outside of these\nvery forests near the Vosges, they laughed loudly at all the dim tales\nconnected with their haunted solitudes; but, on reaching a spot notoriously\neighteen miles deep within them, they agreed with Sir Roger de Coverley\nthat a good deal might be said on both sides.",
        "Such traditions, or any others that (like the stag) connect distant\ngenerations with each other, are, for that cause, sublime; and the sense of\nthe shadowy, connected with such appearances that reveal themselves or not\naccording to circumstances, leaves a coloring of sanctity over ancient\nforests, even in those minds that utterly reject the legend as a fact.",
        "But, apart from all distinct stories of that order, in any solitary\nfrontier between two great empires, as here, for instance, or in the desert\nbetween Syria and the Euphrates, there is an inevitable tendency, in minds\nof any deep sensibility to people the solitudes with phantom images of\npowers that were of old so vast. Joanna, therefore, in her quiet occupation\nof a shepherdess, would be led continually to brood over the political\ncondition of her country, by the traditions of the past no less than by the\nmementoes of the local present.",
        "M. Michelet, indeed, says that La Pucelle was not a shepherdess. I beg\nhis pardon: she was. What he rests upon, I guess pretty well: it is\nthe evidence of a woman called Haumette, the most confidential friend of\nJoanna. Now, she is a good witness, and a good girl, and I like her; for\nshe makes a natural and affectionate report of Joanna’s ordinary life. But\nstill, however good she may be as a witness, Joanna is better; and\nshe, when speaking to the Dauphin, calls herself in the Latin report\nBergereta. Even Haumette confesses that Joanna tended sheep in her\ngirlhood. And I believe, that, if Miss Haumette were taking coffee alone\nwith me this very evening (February 12, 1847)–in which there would be\nno subject for scandal or for maiden blushes, because I am an intense\nphilosopher, and Miss H. would be hard upon four hundred and fifty years\nold–she would admit the following comment upon her evidence to be right. A\nFrenchman, about thirty years ago, M. Simond, in his Travels, mentioned\nincidentally the following hideous scene as one steadily observed and\nwatched by himself in France at a period some trifle before the French\nRevolution:–A peasant was ploughing; and the team that drew his plough was\na donkey and a woman. Both were regularly harnessed: both pulled alike.\nThis is bad enough: but the Frenchman adds, that, in distributing his\nlashes, the peasant was obviously desirous of being impartial: or, if\neither of the yoke-fellows had a right to complain, certainly it was not\nthe donkey. Now, in any country, where such degradation of females could be\ntolerated by the state of manners, a woman of delicacy would shrink from\nacknowledging, either for herself or her friend, that she had ever been\naddicted to any mode of labor not strictly domestic; because, if once\nowning herself a prædial servant, she would be sensible that this\nconfession extended by probability in the hearer’s thoughts to having\nincurred indignities of this horrible kind. Haumette clearly thinks it more\ndignified for Joanna to have been darning the stockings of her horny-hoofed\nfather, Monsieur D’Arc, than keeping sheep, lest she might then be\nsuspected of having ever done something worse. But, luckily, there was no\ndanger of that: Joanna never was in service; and my opinion is that her\nfather should have mended his own stockings, since probably he was the\nparty to make the holes in them, as many a better man than D’Arc does;\nmeaning by that not myself, because, though certainly a better man than\nD’Arc, I protest against doing anything of the kind. If I lived even with\nFriday in Juan Fernandez, either Friday must do all the darning, or else it\nmust go undone. The better men that I meant were the sailors in the British\nnavy, every man of whom mends his own stockings. Who else is to do it?\nDo you suppose, reader, that the junior lords of the admiralty are under\narticles to darn for the navy?",
        "The reason, meantime, for my systematic hatred of D’Arc is this. There was\na story current in France before the Revolution, framed to ridicule the\npauper aristocracy, who happened to have long pedigrees and short rent\nrolls, viz., that a head of such a house, dating from the Crusades, was\noverheard saying to his son, a Chevalier of St. Louis, ’Chevalier, as-tu\ndonné au cochon à manger!” Now, it is clearly made out by the surviving\nevidence, that D’Arc would much have preferred continuing to say–\"Ma\nfille as-tu donné au cochon à manger?” to saying ’Pucelle d’Orléans,\nas-tu sauvé les fleurs-de-lys?” There is an old English copy of verses\nwhich argues thus:–",
        "  “If the man, that turnips cries,\n  Cry not when his father dies–\n  Then ’tis plain the man had rather\n  Have a turnip than his father.”",
        "I cannot say that the logic of these verses was ever entirely to my\nsatisfaction. I do not see my way through it as clearly as could be wished.\nBut I see my way most clearly through D’Arc; and the result is–that he\nwould greatly have preferred not merely a turnip to his father, but the\nsaving a pound or so of bacon to saving the Oriflamme of France.",
        "It is probable (as M. Michelet suggests) that the title of Virgin, or\nPucelle, had in itself, and apart from the miraculous stones about her,\na secret power over the rude soldiery and partisan chiefs of that period;\nfor, in such a person, they saw a representative manifestation of the\nVirgin Mary, who, in a course of centuries, had grown steadily upon the\npopular heart.",
        "As to Joanna’s supernatural detection of the Dauphin (Charles VII.) amongst\nthree hundred lords and knights. I am surprised at the credulity which\ncould ever lend itself to that theatrical juggle. Who admires more than\nmyself the sublime enthusiasm, the rapturous faith in herself, of this pure\ncreature? But I admire not stage artifices, which not La Pucelle, but the\nCourt, must have arranged; nor can surrender myself a dupe to a conjuror’s\nleger-de-main, such as may be seen every day for a shilling. Southey’s\n“Joan of Arc” was published in 1796. Twenty years after, talking with\nSouthey, I was surprised to find him still owning a secret bias in favor of\nJoan, founded on her detection of the Dauphin. The story, for the benefit\nof the reader new to the case, was this:–La Pucelle was first made known\nto the Dauphin, and presented to his court, at Chinon: and here came her\nfirst trial. She was to find out the royal personage amongst the whole ark\nof clean and unclean creatures. Failing in this coup d’essai, she would\nnot simply disappoint many a beating heart in the glittering crowd that on\ndifferent motives yearned for her success, but she would ruin herself–and,\nas the oracle within had told her, would ruin France. Our own sovereign\nlady Victoria rehearses annually a trial not so severe in degree, but the\nsame in kind. She “pricks” for sheriffs. Joanna pricked for a king. But\nobserve the difference: our own lady pricks for two men out of three;\nJoanna for one man out of three hundred. Happy Lady of the islands and the\norient!–she can go astray in her choice only by one half; to the extent\nof one half she must have the satisfaction of being right. And yet, even\nwith these tight limits to the misery of a boundless discretion, permit me,\nliege Lady, with all loyalty, to submit–that now and then you prick with\nyour pin the wrong man. But the poor child from Domrémy, shrinking under\nthe gaze of a dazzling court–not because dazzling (for in visions she had\nseen those that were more so,) but because some of them wore a scoffing\nsmile on their features–how should she throw her line into so deep a\nriver to angle for a king, where many a gay creature was sporting that\nmasqueraded as kings in dress? Nay, even more than any true king would have\ndone: for, in Southey’s version of the story, the Dauphin says, by way of\ntrying the virgin’s magnetic sympathy with royalty,",
        "  ––\"on the throne,\n  I the while mingling with the menial throng,\n  Some courtier shall he seated.”",
        "This usurper is even crowned: “the jeweled crown shines on a menial’s\nhead.” But really, that is ’un peu fort;” and the mob of spectators might\nraise a scruple whether our friend the jackdaw upon the throne, and the\nDauphin himself, were not grazing the shins of treason. For the Dauphin\ncould not lend more than belonged to him. According to the popular notion,\nhe had no crown for himself, but, at most, a petit ecu, worth thirty\npence; consequently none to lend, on any pretence whatever, until the\nconsecrated Maid should take him to Rheims. This was the popular notion\nin France. The same notion as to the indispensableness of a coronation\nprevails widely in England. But, certainly, it was the Dauphin’s interest\nto support the popular notion, as he meant to use the services of Joanna.\nFor, if he were king already, what was it that she could do for him beyond\nOrleans? And above all, if he were king without a coronation, and without\nthe oil from the sacred ampulla, what advantage was yet open to him by\ncelerity above his competitor the English boy? Now was to be a race for a\ncoronation: he that should win that race, carried the superstition of\nFrance along with him. Trouble us not, lawyer, with your quillets. We are\nillegal blockheads; so thoroughly without law, that we don’t know even if\nwe have a right to be blockheads; and our mind is made up–that the first\nman drawn from the oven of coronation at Rheims, is the man that is baked\ninto a king. All others are counterfeits, made of base Indian meal, damaged\nby sea-water.",
        "La Pucelle, before she could be allowed to practise as a warrior, was put\nthrough her manual and platoon exercise, as a juvenile pupil in divinity,\nbefore six eminent men in wigs. According to Southey (v. 393, Book III., in\nthe original edition of his “Joan of Arc”) she “appall’d the doctors.” It’s\nnot easy to do that: but they had some reason to feel bothered, as that\nsurgeon would assuredly feel bothered, who, upon proceeding to dissect a\nsubject, should find the subject retaliating as a dissector upon himself,\nespecially if Joanna ever made the speech to them which occupies v.\n354-391, B. III. It is a double impossibility; 1st, because a piracy from\nTindal’s Christianity as Old as the Creation: now a piracy à parte postis common enough; but a piracy à parte ante, and by three centuries,\nwould (according to our old English phrase[5]) drive a coach-and-six\nthrough any copyright act that man born of woman could frame. 2dly, it is\nquite contrary to the evidence on Joanna’s trial; for Southey’s “Joan” of\nA. Dom. 1796 (Cottle, Bristol), tells the doctors, amongst other secrets,\nthat she never in her life attended–1st, Mass; nor 2d, the Sacramental\ntable; nor 3d, Confession. Here’s a precious windfall for the doctors;\nthey, by snaky tortuosities, had hoped, through the aid of a corkscrew,\n(which every D. D. or S.T.P. is said to carry in his pocket,) for the\nhappiness of ultimately extracting from Joanna a few grains of heretical\npowder or small shot, which might have justified their singeing her a\nlittle. And just at such a crisis, expressly to justify their burning her\nto a cinder, up gallops Joanna with a brigade of guns, unlimbers, and\nserves them out with heretical grape and deistical round-shot enough to lay\na kingdom under interdict. Any miracles, to which Joanna might treat the\ngrim D. Ds. after that, would go to the wrong side of her little account\nin the clerical books. Joanna would be created a Dr. herself, but not of\nDivinity. For in the Joanna page of the ledger the entry would be–\"Miss\nJoanna, in acct. with the Church, Dr. by sundry diabolic miracles, she\nhaving publicly preached heresy, shown herself a witch, and even tried hard\nto corrupt the principles of six church pillars.” In the mean time, all\nthis deistical confession of Joanna’s, besides being suicidal for the\ninterest of her cause, is opposed to the depositions upon both trials.\nThe very best witness called from first to last deposes that Joanna\nattended these rites of her Church even too often; was taxed with doing so;\nand, by blushing, owned the charge as a fact, though certainly not as a\nfault. Joanna was a girl of natural piety, that saw God in forests,\nand hills, and fountains; but did not the less seek him in chapels and\nconsecrated oratories.",
        "This peasant girl was self-educated through her own natural meditativeness.\nIf the reader turns to that divine passage in Paradise Regained, which\nMilton has put into the mouth of our Saviour when first entering the\nwilderness, and musing upon the tendency of those great impulses growing\nwithin himself–",
        "  “Oh, what a multitude of thoughts arise!” &c.",
        "he will have some notion of the vast reveries which brooded over the heart\nof Joanna in early girlhood, when the wings were budding that should carry\nher from Orleans to Rheims; when the golden chariot was dimly revealing\nitself that should carry her from the kingdom of France Delivered to the\neternal kingdom.",
        "It is not requisite, for the honor of Joanna, nor is there, in this place,\nroom to pursue her brief career of action. That, though wonderful, forms\nthe earthly part of her story: the intellectual part is, the saintly\npassion of her imprisonment, trial, and execution. It is unfortunate,\ntherefore, for Southey’s “Joan of Arc,” (which however should always be\nregarded as a juvenile effort,) that, precisely when her real glory\nbegins, the poem ends. But this limitation of the interest grew, no doubt,\nfrom the constraint inseparably attached to the law of epic unity. Joanna’s\nhistory bisects into two opposite hemispheres, and both could not have been\npresented to the eye in one poem, unless by sacrificing all unity of theme,\nor else by involving the earlier half, as a narrative episode, in the\nlatter;–this might have been done–it might have been communicated to a\nfellow-prisoner, or a confessor, by Joanna herself, in the same way that\nVirgil has contrived to acquaint the reader, through the hero’s mouth, with\nearlier adventures that, if told by the poet speaking in his own person,\nwould have destroyed the unity of his fable. The romantic interest of the\nearly and irrelate incidents (last night of Troy, &c.) is thrown as an\naffluent into the general river of the personal narrative, whilst yet the\ncapital current of the epos, as unfolding ihe origin and incunabula of\nRome, is not for a moment suffered to be modified by events so subordinate\nand so obliquely introduced. It is sufficient, as concerns this section\nof Joanna’s life to say–that she fulfilled, to the height of her promises,\nthe restoration of the prostrate throne. France had become a province of\nEngland; and for the ruin of both, if such a yoke could be maintained.\nDreadful pecuniary exhaustion caused the English energy to droop; and\nthat critical opening La Pucelle used with a corresponding felicity\nof audacity and suddenness (that were in themselves portentous) for\nintroducing the wedge of French native resources, for rekindling the\nnational pride, and for planting the Dauphin once more upon his feet. When\nJoanna appeared, he had been on the point of giving up the struggle with\nthe English, distressed as they were, and of flying to the south of France.\nShe taught him to blush for such abject counsels. She liberated Orleans,\nthat great city, so decisive by its fate for the issue of the war, and then\nbeleaguered by the English with an elaborate application of engineering\nskill unprecedented in Europe. Entering the city after sunset, on the 29th\nof April, she sang mass on Sunday, May 8, for the entire disappearance of\nthe besieging force. On the 29th of June, she fought and gained over the\nEnglish the decisive battle of Patay; on the 9th of July, she took Troyes\nby a coup-de-main from a mixed garrison of English and Burgundians; on the\n15th of that month, she carried the Dauphin into Rheims; on Sunday the\n17th, she crowned him; and there she rested from her labor of triumph. What\nremained was–to suffer.",
        "All this forward movement was her own: excepting one man, the whole council\nwas against her. Her enemies were all that drew power from earth. Her\nsupporters were her own strong enthusiasm, and the headlong contagion\nby which she carried this sublime frenzy into the hearts of women, of\nsoldiers, and of all who lived by labor. Henceforwards she was thwarted;\nand the worst error, that she committed, was to lend the sanction of her\npresence to counsels which she disapproved. But she had accomplished the\ncapital objects which her own visions had dictated. These involved all the\nrest. Errors were now less important; and doubtless it had now become more\ndifficult for herself to pronounce authentically what were errors. The\nnoble girl had achieved, as by a rapture of motion, the capital end of\nclearing out a free space around her sovereign, giving him the power to\nmove his arms with effect; and, secondly, the inappreciable end of winning\nfor that sovereign what seemed to all France the heavenly ratification of\nhis rights, by crowning him with the ancient solemnities. She had made it\nimpossible for the English now to step before her. They were caught in an\nirretrievable blunder, owing partly to discord amongst the uncles of Henry\nVI., partly to a want of funds, but partly to the very impossibility which\nthey believed to press with tenfold force upon any French attempt to\nforestall theirs. They laughed at such a thought; and whilst they laughed,\nshe did it. Henceforth the single redress for the English of this capital\noversight, but which never could have redressed it effectually, was–to\nvitiate and taint the coronation of Charles VII. as the work of a witch.\nThat policy, and not malice, (as M. Michelet is so happy to believe,) was\nthe moving principle in the subsequent prosecution of Joanna. Unless\nthey unhinged the force of the first coronation in the popular mind, by\nassociating it with power given from hell, they felt that the sceptre of\nthe invader was broken.",
        "But she, the child that, at nineteen, had wrought wonders so great for\nFrance, was she not elated? Did she not lose, as men so often have lost,\nall sobriety of mind when standing upon the pinnaclè of successes so giddy?\nLet her enemies declare. During the progress of her movement, and in\nthe centre of ferocious struggles, she had manifested the temper of her\nfeelings by the pity which she had every where expressed for the suffering\nenemy. She forwarded to the English leaders a touching invitation to unite\nwith the French, as brothers, in a common crusade against infidels, thus\nopening the road for a soldierly retreat. She interposed to protect\nthe captive or the wounded–she mourned over the excesses of her\ncountrymen–she threw herself off her horse to kneel by the dying English\nsoldier, and to comfort him with such ministrations, physical or spiritual,\nas his situation allowed. “Nolebat,” says the evidence, “uti onso suo, aut\nquemquam interficere.” She sheltered the English, that invoked her aid, in\nher own quarters. She wept as she beheld, stretched on the field of battle,\nso many brave enemies that had died without confession. And, as regarded\nherself, her elation expressed itself thus:–on the day when she had\nfinished her work, she wept; for she knew that, when her task was done, her\nend must be approaching. Her aspirations pointed only to a place, which\nseemed to her more than usually full of natural piety, as one in which it\nwould give her pleasure to die. And she uttered, between smiles and tears,\nas a wish that inexpressibly fascinated her heart, and yet was half\nfantastic, a broken prayer that God would return her to the solitudes from\nwhich he had drawn her, and suffer her to become a shepherdess once more.\nIt was a natural prayer, because nature has laid a necessity upon every\nhuman heart to seek for rest, and to shrink from torment. Yet, again, it\nwas a half-fantastic prayer, because, from childhood upwards, visions that\nshe had no power to mistrust, and the voices which sounded in her ear for\never, had long since persuaded her mind, that for her no such prayer\ncould be granted. Too well she felt that her mission must be worked out to\nthe end, and that the end was now at hand. All went wrong from this time.\nShe herself had created the funds out of which the French restoration\nshould grow; but she was not suffered to witness their development, or\ntheir prosperous application. More than one military plan was entered upon\nwhich she did not approve. But she still continued to expose her person\nas before. Severe wounds had not taught her caution. And at length, in a\nsortie from Compeigne, whether through treacherous collusion on the part\nof her own friends is doubtful to this day, she was made prisoner by the\nBurgundians, and finally surrendered to the English.",
        "Now came her trial. This trial, moving of course under English influence,\nwas conducted in chief by the Bishop of Beauvais. He was a Frenchman, sold\nto English interests, and hoping, by favor of the English leaders, to\nreach the highest preferment. Bishop that art, Archbishop that shalt be,\nCardinal that mayest be, were the words that sounded continually in his\near; and doubtless, a whisper of visions still higher, of a triple crown,\nand feet upon the necks of kings, sometimes stole into his heart. M.\nMichelet is anxious to keep us in mind that this Bishop was but an agent\nof the English. True. But it does not better the case for his countryman;\nthat, being an accomplice in the crime, making himself the leader in the\npersecution against the helpless girl, he was willing to be all this in\nthe spirit, and with the conscious vileness of a catspaw. Never from the\nfoundations of the earth was there such a trial as this, if it were laid\nopen in all its beauty of defence, and all its hellishness of attack. Oh,\nchild of France! shepherdess, peasant girl! trodden under foot by all\naround thee, how I honor thy flashing intellect, quick as God’s lightning,\nand true as that lightning to its mark, that ran before France and laggard\nEurope by many a century, confounding the malice of the ensnarer, and\nmaking dumb the oracles of falsehood! Is it not scandalous, is it not\nhumiliating to civilization, that, even at this day, France exhibits the\nhorrid spectacle of judges examining the prisoner against himself; seducing\nhim, by fraud, into treacherous conclusions against his own head; using the\nterrors of their power for extorting confessions from the frailty of hope;\nnay, (which is worse,) using the blandishments of condescension and snaky\nkindness for thawing into compliances of gratitude those whom they had\nfailed to freeze into terror? Wicked judges! Barbarian jurisprudence! that,\nsitting in your own conceit on the summits of social wisdom, have yet\nfailed to learn the first principles of criminal justice; sit ye humbly and\nwith docility at the feet of this girl from Domrémy, that tore your webs of\ncruelty into shreds and dust, “Would you examine me as a witness against\nmyself?” was the question by which many times she defied their arts.\nContinually she showed that their interrogations were irrelevant to any\nbusiness before the court, or that entered into the ridiculous charges\nagainst her. General questions were proposed to her on points of\ncasuistical divinity; two-edged questions which not one of themselves could\nhave answered without, on the one side, landing himself in heresy (as\nthen interpreted), or, on the other, in some presumptuous expression of\nself-esteem. Next came a wretched Dominican that pressed her with an\nobjection, which, if applied to the Bible, would tax every one of its\nmiracles with unsoundness. The monk had the excuse of never having read the\nBible. M. Michelet has no such excuse; and it makes one blush for him, as a\nphilosopher, to find him describing such an argument as “weighty,” whereas\nit is but a varied expression of rude Mahometan metaphysics. Her answer\nto this, if there were room to place the whole in a clear light, was as\nshattering as it was rapid. Another thought to entrap her by asking what\nlanguage the angelic visitors of her solitude had talked: as though\nheavenly counsels could want polyglott interpreters for every word, or that\nGod needed language at all in whispering thoughts to a human heart. Then\ncame a worse devil, who asked her whether the archangel Michael had\nappeared naked. Not comprehending the vile insinuation, Joanna, whose\npoverty suggested to her simplicity that it might be the costliness or\nsuitable robes which caused the demur, asked them if they fancied God,\nwho clothed the flowers of the valleys, unable to find raiment for his\nservants. The answer of Joanna moves a smile of tenderness, but the\ndisappointment of her judges makes one laugh horribly. Others succeeded\nby troops, who upbraided her with leaving her father; as if that greater\nFather, whom she believed herself to have been serving, did not retain the\npower of dispensing with his own rules, or had not said, that, for a less\ncause than martyrdom, man and woman should leave both father and mother.",
        "On Easter Sunday, when the trial had been long proceeding, the poor girl\nfell so ill as to cause a belief that she had been poisoned. It was not\npoison. Nobody had any interest in hastening a death so certain. M.\nMichelet, whose sympathies with all feelings are so quick that one would\ngladly see them always as justly directed, reads the case most truly.\nJoanna had a two-fold malady. She was visited by a paroxysm of the\ncomplaint called home-sickness; the cruel nature of her imprisonment, and\nits length, could not but point her solitary thoughts, in darkness, and in\nchains, (for chained she was,) to Domrémy. And the season, which was the\nmost heavenly period of the spring, added stings to this yearning. That\nwas one of her maladies–nostalgia, as medicine calls it; the other was\nweariness and exhaustion from daily combats with malice. She saw that\neverybody hated her, and thirsted for her blood; nay, many kind-hearted\ncreatures that would have pitied her profoundly as regarded all political\ncharges, had their natural feelings warped by the belief that she had\ndealings with fiendish powers. She knew she was to die; that was not the\nmisery; the misery was that this consummation could not be reached without\nso much intermediate strife, as if she were contending for some chance\n(where chance was none) of happiness, or were dreaming for a moment of\nescaping the inevitable. Why, then, did she contend? Knowing that she\nwould reap nothing from answering her persecutors, why did she not retire\nby silence from the superfluous contest? It was because her quick and eager\nloyalty to truth would not suffer her to see it darkened by frauds, which\nshe could expose, but others, even of candid listeners, perhaps, could\nnot; it was through that imperishable grandeur of soul, which taught her\nto submit meekly and without a struggle to her punishment, but taught\nher not to submit–no, not for a moment–to calumny as to facts, or to\nmisconstruction as to motives. Besides, there were secretaries all around\nthe court taking down her words. That was meant for no good to her. But\nthe end does not always correspond to the meaning. And Joanna might say to\nherself–these words that will be used against me to-morrow and the next\nday, perhaps in some nobler generation may rise again for my justification.\nYes, Joanna, they are rising even now in Paris, and for more than\njustification.",
        "Woman, sister–there are some things which you do not execute as well as\nyour brother, man; no, nor ever will. Pardon me if I doubt whether you will\never produce a great poet from your choirs, or a Mozart, or a Phidias, or a\nMichael Angelo, or a great philosopher, or a great scholar. By which last\nis meant–not one who depends simply on an infinite memory, but also on an\ninfinite and electrical power of combination; bringing together from the\nfour winds, like the angel of the resurrection, what else were dust from\ndead men’s bones, into the unity of breathing life. If you can create\nyourselves into any of these great creators, why have you not? Do not ask\nme to say otherwise; because if you do, you will lead me into temptation.\nFor I swore early in life never to utter a falsehood, and, above all, a\nsycophantic falsehood; and, in the false homage of the modern press towards\nwomen, there is horrible sycophancy. It is as hollow, most of it, and it is\nas fleeting as is the love that lurks in uxoriousness. Yet, if a woman\nasks me to tell a faleshood, I have long made up my mind–that on moral\nconsiderations I will, and ought to do so, whether it be for any\npurpose of glory to her, or of screening her foibles (for she doescommit a few), or of humbly, as a vassal, paying a peppercorn rent to her\naugust privilege of caprice. Barring these cases, I must adhere to my\nresolution of telling no fibs. And I repeat, therefore, but not to be rude,\nI repeat in Latin–",
        "  Excudent alii meliús spirantia signa,\n  Credo equidem vivos ducent de marmore vultus:\n  Altius ascendent: at tu caput, Eva, memento\n  Sandalo ut infringas referenti oracula tanta.[6]",
        "Yet, sister woman–though I cannot consent to find a Mozart or a Michael\nAngelo in your sex, until that day when you claim my promise as to\nfalsehood–cheerfully, and with the love that burns in depths of\nadmiration, I acknowledge that you can do one thing as well as the best of\nus men–a greater thing than even Mozart is known to have done, or Michael\nAngelo–you can die grandly, and as goddesses would die were goddesses\nmortal. If any distant world (which may be the case) are so far ahead\nof us Tellurians in optical resources as to see distinctly through their\ntelescopes all that we do on earth, what is the grandest sight to which we\never treat them? St. Peter’s at Rome, do you fancy, on Easter Sunday, or\nLuxor, or perhaps the Himalayas? Pooh! pooh! my friend: suggest something\nbetter; these are baubles to them; they see in other worlds, in their\nown, far better toys of the same kind. These, take my word for it, are\nnothing. Do you give it up? The finest thing, then, we have to show them\nis a scaffold on the morning of execution. I assure you there is a strong\nmuster in those fair telescopic worlds, on any such morning, of those who\nhappen to find themselves occupying the right hemisphere for a peep\nat us. Telescopes look up in the market on that morning, and bear a\nmonstrous premium; for they cheat, probably, in those scientific worlds as\nwell as we do. How, then, if it be announced in some such telescopic world\nby those who make a livelihood of catching glimpses at our newspapers,\nwhose language they have long since deciphered, that the poor victim in the\nmorning’s sacrifice is a woman? How, if it be published on that distant\nworld that the sufferer wears upon her head, in the eyes of many, the\ngarlands of martyrdom? How, if it should be some Marie Antoinette, the\nwidowed queen, coming forward on the scaffold, and presenting to the\nmorning air her head, turned gray prematurely by sorrow, daughter of Cæsars\nkneeling down humbly to kiss the guillotine, as one that worships death?\nHow, if it were the “martyred wife of Roland,” uttering impassioned\ntruth–truth odious to the rulers of her country–with her expiring breath?\nHow, if it were the noble Charlotte Corday, that in the bloom of youth,\nthat with the loveliest of persons, that with homage waiting upon her\nsmiles wherever she turned her face to scatter them–homage that followed\nthose smiles as surely as the carols of birds, after showers in spring,\nfollow the re-appearing sun and the racing of sunbeams over the hills–yet\nthought all these things cheaper than the dust upon her sandals in\ncomparison of deliverance from hell for her dear suffering France? Ah!\nthese were spectacles indeed for those sympathizing people in distant\nworlds; and some, perhaps, would suffer a sort of martyrdom themselves,\nbecause they could not testify their wrath, could not bear witness to the\nstrength of love, and to the fury of hatred, that burned within them at\nsuch scenes; could not gather into golden urns some of that glorious dust\nwhich rested in the catacombs of earth.",
        "On the Wednesday after Trinity Sunday in 1431, being then about nineteen\nyears of age, the Maid of Arc underwent her martyrdom. She was conducted\nbefore mid-day, guarded by eight hundred spearmen, to a platform of\nprodigious height, constructed of wooden billets supported by occasional\nwalls of lath and plaster, and traversed by hollow spaces in every\ndirection for the creation of air-currents. The pile “struck terror,” says\nM. Michelet, “by its height;” and, as usual, the English purpose in this is\nviewed as one of pure malignity. But there are two ways of explaining all\nthat. It is probable that the purpose was merciful. On the circumstances of\nthe execution I shall not linger. Yet, to mark the almost fatal felicity\nof M. Michelet in finding out whatever may injure the English name, at\na moment when every reader will be interested in Joanna’s personal\nappearance, it is really edifying to notice the ingenuity by which he draws\ninto light from a dark corner a very unjust account of it, and neglects,\nthough lying upon the high road, a very pleasing one. Both are from English\npens. Grafton, a chronicler but little read, being a stiff-necked John\nBull, thought fit to say, that no wonder Joanna should be a virgin, since\nher “foule face” was a satisfactory solution of that particular merit.\nHolinshead, on the other hand, a chronicler somewhat later, every way more\nimportant, and universally read, has given a very pleasing testimony to the\ninteresting character of Joanna’s person and engaging manners. Neither\nof these men lived till the following century, so that personally this\nevidence is none at all. Grafton sullenly and carelessly believed as\nhe wished to believe; Holinshead took pains to inquire, and reports\nundoubtedly the general impression of France. But I cite the case as\nillustrating M. Michelet’s candor.[7]",
        "The circumstantial incidents of the execution, unless with more space\nthan I can now command, I should be unwilling to relate. I should fear\nto injure, by imperfect report, a martyrdom which to myself appears so\nunspeakably grand. Yet for a purpose pointing, not at Joanna but at M.\nMichelet,–viz., to convince him that an Englishman is capable of thinking\nmore highly of La Pucelle than even her admiring countryman, I shall, in\nparting, allude to one or two traits in Joanna’s demeanor on the scaffold,\nand to one or two in that of the bystanders, which authorize me in\nquestioning an opinion of his upon this martyr’s firmness. The reader ought\nto be reminded that Joanna d’Arc was subjected to an unusually unfair trial\nof opinion. Any of the elder Christian martyrs had not much to fear of\npersonal rancor. The martyr was chiefly regarded as the enemy of Cæsar;\nat times, also, where any knowledge of the Christian faith and morals\nexisted, with the enmity that arises spontaneously in the worldly against\nthe spiritual. But the martyr, though disloyal, was not supposed to be,\ntherefore, anti-national; and still less was individually hateful. What\nwas hated (if anything) belonged to his class, not to himself separately.\nNow Joanna, if hated at all, was hated personally, and in Rouen on national\ngrounds. Hence there would be a certainty of calumny arising against her,\nsuch as would not affect martyrs in general. That being the case, it would\nfollow of necessity that some people would impute to her a willingness to\nrecant. No innocence could escape that. Now, had she really testified\nthis willingness on the scaffold, it would have argued nothing at all but\nthe weakness of a genial nature shrinking from the instant approach of\ntorment. And those will often pity that weakness most, who, in their own\npersons, would yield to it least. Meantime, there never was a calumny\nuttered that drew less support from the recorded circumstances. It rests\nupon no positive testimony, and it has a weight of contradicting\ntestimony to stem. And yet, strange to say, M. Michelet, who at times seems\nto admire the Maid of Arc as much as I do, is the one sole writer amongst\nher friends who lends some countenance to this odious slander. His words\nare, that, if she did not utter this word recant with her lips, she\nuttered it in her heart. “Whether, she said the word is uncertain: but I\naffirm that she thought it.”",
        "Now, I affirm that she did not; not in any sense of the word ’thought\"\napplicable to the case. Here is France calumniating La Pucelle: here\nis England defending her. M. Michelet can only mean, that, on a prioriprinciples, every woman must be presumed liable to such a weakness; that\nJoanna was a woman; ergo, that she was liable to such a weakness. That\nis, he only supposes her to have uttered the word by an argument which\npresumes it impossible for anybody to have done otherwise. I, on the\ncontrary, throw the onus of the argument not on presumable tendencies of\nnature, but on the known facts of that morning’s execution, as recorded\nby multitudes. What else, I demand, than mere weight of metal, absolute\nnobility of deportment, broke the vast line of battle then arrayed against\nher? What else but her meek, saintly demeanor, won from the enemies, that\ntill now had believed her a witch, tears of rapturous admiration? “Ten\nthousand men,” says M. Michelet himself, “ten thousand men wept;” and of\nthese ten thousand the majority were political enemies knitted together by\ncords of superstition. What else was it but her constancy, united with her\nangelic gentleness, that drove the fanatic English soldier–who had sworn\nto throw a faggot on her scaffold, as his tribute of abhorrence, that\ndid so, that fulfilled his vow–suddenly to turn away a penitent for\nlife, saying everywhere that he had seen a dove rising upon wings to heaven\nfrom the ashes where she had stood? What else drove the executioner to\nkneel at every shrine for pardon to his share in the tragedy? And, if all\nthis were insufficient, then I cite the closing act of her life as valid\non her behalf, were all other testimonies against her. The executioner had\nbeen directed to apply his torch from below. He did so. The fiery smoke\nrose upwards in billowing volumes. A Dominican monk was then standing\nalmost at her side. Wrapt up in his sublime office, he saw not the danger,\nbut still persisted in his prayers. Even then, when the last enemy was\nracing up the fiery stairs to seize her, even at that moment did this\nnoblest of girls think only for him, the one friend that would not\nforsake her, and not for herself; bidding him with her last breath to care\nfor his own preservation, but to leave her to God. That girl, whose\nlatest breath ascended in this sublime expression of self-oblivion, did not\nutter the word recant either with her lips or in her heart. No; she did\nnot, though one should rise from the dead to swear it.",
        "Bishop of Beauvais! thy victim died in fire upon a scaffold–thou upon a\ndown bed. But for the departing minutes of life, both are oftentimes alike.\nAt the farewell crisis, when the gates of death are opening, and flesh is\nresting from its struggles, oftentimes the tortured and the torturer have\nthe same truce from carnal torment; both sink together into sleep; together\nboth, sometimes, kindle into dreams. When the mortal mists were gathering\nfast upon you two, Bishop and Shepherd girl–when the pavilions of life\nwere closing up their shadowy curtains about you–let us try, through the\ngigantic glooms, to decipher the flying features of your separate visions.",
        "The shepherd girl that had delivered France–she, from her dungeon, she,\nfrom her baiting at the stake, she, from her duel with fire, as she entered\nher last dream–saw Domrémy, saw the fountain of Domrémy, saw the pomp of\nforests in which her childhood had wandered. That Easter festival, which\nman had denied to her languishing heart–that resurrection of spring-time,\nwhich the darkness of dungeons had intercepted from her, hungering after\nthe glorious liberty of forests–were by God given back into her hands, as\njewels that had been stolen from her by robbers. With those, perhaps, (for\nthe minutes of dreams can stretch into ages,) was given back to her by God\nthe bliss of childhood. By special privilege, for her might be created,\nin this farewell dream, a second childhood, innocent as the first; but not,\nlike that, sad with the gloom of a fearful mission in the rear. This\nmission had now been fulfilled. The storm was weathered, the skirts even of\nthat mighty storm were drawing off. The blood, that she was to reckon for,\nhad been exacted; the tears, that she was to shed in secret, had been paid\nto the last. The hatred to herself in all eyes had been faced steadily, had\nbeen suffered, had been survived. And in her last fight upon the scaffold\nshe had triumphed gloriously; victoriously she had tasted the stings of\ndeath. For all, except this comfort from her farewell dream, she had\ndied–died, amidst the tears of ten thousand enemies–died, amidst the\ndrums and trumpets of armies–died, amidst peals redoubling upon peals,\nvolleys upon volleys, from the saluting clarions of martyrs.",
        "Bishop of Beauvais! because the guilt-burthened man is in dreams haunted\nand waylaid by the most frightful of his crimes, and because upon that\nfluctuating mirror–rising (like the mocking mirrors of mirage in Arabian\ndeserts) from the fens of death–most of all are reflected the sweet\ncountenances which the man has laid in ruins; therefore I know, Bishop,\nthat you, also, entering your final dream, saw Domrémy. That fountain,\nof which the witnesses spoke so much, showed itself to your eyes in pure\nmorning dews; but neither dews, nor the holy dawn, could cleanse away the\nbright spots of innocent blood upon its surface. By the fountain, Bishop,\nyou saw a woman seated, that hid her face. But as you draw near, the\nwoman raises her wasted features. Would Domrémy know them again for the\nfeatures of her child? Ah, but you know them, Bishop, well! Oh, mercy!\nwhat a groan was that which the servants, waiting outside the Bishop’s\ndream at his bedside, heard from his laboring heart, as at this moment he\nturned away from the fountain and the woman, seeking rest in the forests\nafar off. Yet not so to escape the woman, whom once again he must behold\nbefore he dies. In the forests to which he prays for pity, will he find a\nrespite? What a tumult, what a gathering of feet is there! In glades, where\nonly wild deer should run, armies and nations are assembling; towering in\nthe fluctuating crowd are phantoms that belong to departed hours. There is\nthe great English Prince, Regent of France. There is my Lord of Winchester,\nthe princely Cardinal, that died and made no sign. There is the Bishop of\nBeauvais, clinging to the shelter of thickets. What building is that which\nhands so rapid are raising? Is it a martyr’s scaffold? Will they burn the\nchild of Domrémy a second time? No: it is a tribunal that rises to the\nclouds; and two nations stand around it, waiting for a trial. Shall my Lord\nof Beauvais sit again upon the judgment-seat, and again number the hours\nfor the innocent? Ah! no: he is the prisoner at the bar. Already all is\nwaiting; the mighty audience is gathered, the Court is hurrying to their\nseats, the witnesses are arrayed, the trumpets are sounding, the judge\nis going to take his place. Oh! but this is sudden. My lord, have you\nno counsel? “Counsel I have none: in heaven above, or on earth beneath,\ncounsellor there is none now that would take a brief from me: all are\nsilent.” Is it, indeed, come to this? Alas! the time is short, the tumult\nis wondrous, the crowd stretches away into infinity, but yet I will search\nin it for somebody to take your brief: I know of somebody that will be your\ncounsel. Who is this that cometh from Domrémy? Who is she that cometh in\nbloody coronation robes from Rheims? Who is she that cometh with blackened\nflesh from walking the furnaces of Rouen? This is she, the shepherd girl,\ncounsellor that had none for herself, whom I choose, Bishop, for yours. She\nit is, I engage, that shall take my lord’s brief. She it is, Bishop, that\nwould plead for you: yes, Bishop, SHE–when heaven and earth are silent.",

        "Arc:–Modern France, that should know a great deal better than myself,\ninsists that the name is not d’Arc, i.e. of Arc, but Darc. Now it\nhappens sometimes, that if a person, whose position guarantees his access\nto the best information, will content himself with gloomy dogmatism,\nstriking the table with his fist, and saying in a terrific voice–\"It is\nso; and there’s an end of it,\"–one bows deferentially; and submits. But\nif, unhappily for himself, won by this docility, he relents too amiably\ninto reasons and arguments, probably one raises an insurrection against him\nthat may never be crushed; for in the fields of logic one can skirmish,\nperhaps, as well as he. Had he confined himself to dogmatism; he would have\nentrenched his position in darkness, and have hidden his own vulnerable\npoints. But coming down to base reasons, he lets in light, and one sees\nwhere to plant the blows. Now, the worshipful reason of modern France for\ndisturbing the old received spelling, is–that Jean Hordal, a descendant of\nLa Pucelle’s brother, spelled the name Darc, in 1612. But what of that?\nBeside the chances that M. Hordal might be a gigantic blockhead, it is\nnotorious that what small matter of spelling Providence had thought fit to\ndisburse amongst man in the seventeenth century, was all monopolized by\nprinters: in France, much more so.]",

But, really, as the name was so\nexceedingly common, few people will detect a mystery in calling a boy by\nthe name of Jack, though it does seem mysterious to call a girl Jack. It\nmay be less so in France, where a beautiful practice has always prevailed\nof giving to a boy his mother’s name–preceded and strengthened by a male\nname, as Charles Anne, Victor Victoire. In cases where a mother’s\nmemory has been unusually dear to a son, this vocal memento of her,\nlocked into the circle of his own name, gives to it the tenderness of a\ntestamentary relique, or a funeral ring.

        "Amongst the many ebullitions of M. Michelet’s fury against us poor English,\nare four which will be likely to amuse the reader; and they are the more\nconspicuous in collision with the justice which he sometimes does us, and\nthe very indignant admiration which, under some aspects, he grants to us.",
        "1. Our English literature he admires with some gnashing of teeth. He\npronounces it “fine and sombre,” but, I lament to add, “sceptical, Judaic,\nSatanic–in a word, Anti-Christian.” That Lord Byron should figure as a\nmember of this diabolical corporation, will not surprise men. It willsurprise them to hear that Milton is one of its Satanic leaders. Many are\nthe generous and eloquent Frenchmen, beside Chateaubriand, who have, in\nthe course of the last thirty years, nobly suspended their own burning\nnationality, in order to render a more rapturous homage at the feet of\nMilton; and some of them have raised Milton almost to a level with angelic\nnatures. Not one of them has thought of looking for him below the earth.\nAs to Shakspeare, M. Michelet detects in him a most extraordinary mare’s\nnest. It is this: he does “not recollect to have seen the name of God” in\nany part of his works. On reading such words, it is natural to rub one’s\neyes, and suspect that all one has ever seen in this world may have been\na pure ocular delusion. In particular, I begin myself to suspect that the\nword ’la gloire” never occurs in any Parisian journal. “The great English\nnation,” says M. Michelet, “has one immense profound vice,” to wit,\n“pride.” Why, really, that may be true; but we have a neighbor not\nabsolutely clear of an “immense profound vice,” as like ours in color and\nshape as cherry to cherry. In short, M. Michelet thinks us, by fits and\nstarts, admirable, only that we are detestable; and he would adore some of\nour authors, were it not that so intensely he could have wished to kick\nthem.",
        "2. M. Michelet thinks to lodge an arrow in our sides by a very odd remark\nupon Thomas à Kempis: which is, that a man of any conceivable European\nblood–a Finlander, suppose, or a Zantiote–might have written Tom; only\nnot an Englishman. Whether an Englishman could have forged Tom, must remain\na matter of doubt, unless the thing had been tried long ago. That problem\nwas intercepted for ever by Tom’s perverseness in choosing to manufacture\nhimself. Yet, since nobody is better aware than M. Michelet, that this very\npoint of Kempis having manufactured Kempis is furiously and hopelessly\nlitigated, three or four nations claiming to have forged his work for him,\nthe shocking old doubt will raise its snaky head once more–whether this\nforger, who rests in so much darkness, might not, after all, be of English\nblood. Tom, it may be feared, is known to modern English literature chiefly\nby an irreverent mention of his name in a line of Peter Pindar’s (Dr.\nWolcot) fifty years back, where he is described as",
        "  “Kempis Tom,\n  Who clearly shows the way to Kingdom Come.”",
        "Few in these days can have read him, unless in the Methodist version of\nJohn Wesley. Amongst those few, however, happens to be myself; which arose\nfrom the accident of having, when a boy of eleven, received a copy of the\nDe Imitatione Christi, as a bequest from a relation, who died very young;\nfrom which cause, and from the external prettiness of the book, being a\nGlasgow reprint, by the celebrated Foulis, and gaily bound, I was induced\nto look into it; and finally read it many times over, partly out of\nsome sympathy which, even in those days, I had with its simplicity and\ndevotional fervor; but much more from the savage delight I found in\nlaughing at Tom’s Latinity. That, I freely grant to M. Michelet, is\ninimitable; else, as regards substance, it strikes me that I could forge a\nbetter De Imitatione myself. But there is no knowing till one tries. Yet,\nafter all, it is not certain whether the original was Latin. But, however\nthat may have been, if it is possible that M. Michelet[A] can be accurate\nin saying that there are no less than sixty French versions (not\neditions, observe, but separate versions) existing of the De Imitatione,\nhow prodigious must have been the adaptation of the book to the religious\nheart of the fifteenth century! Excepting the Bible, but excepting\nthat only in Protestant lands, no book known to man has had the same\ndistinction. It is the most marvellous bibliographical fact on record.",
        "[Footnote A: “If M. Michelet can be accurate.” However, on consideration,\nthis statement does not depend on Michelet. The bibliographer, Barbier,\nhas absolutely specified sixty in a separate dissertation, soixante\ntraductions, amongst those even that have not escaped the search. The\nItalian translations are said to be thirty. As to mere editions, not\ncounting the early MSS. for half a century before printing was introduced,\nthose in Latin amount to two thousand, and those in French to one thousand.\nMeantime, it is very clear to me that this astonishing popularity, so\nentirely unparalleled in literature, could not have existed except in Roman\nCatholic times, nor subsequently have lingered in any Protestant land. It\nwas the denial of Scripture fountains to thirsty lands which made this\nslender rill of Scripture truth so passionately welcome.]",
        "3. Our English girls, it seems, are as faulty in one way as we English\nmales in another. None of us lads could have written the Opera Omnia of\nMr. à Kempis; neither could any of our lasses have assumed male attire like\nLa Pucelle. But why? Because, says Michelet, English girls and German\nthink so much of an indecorum. Well, that is a good fault, generally\nspeaking. But M. Michelet ought to have remembered a fact in the\nmartyrologies which justifies both parties,–the French heroine for doing,\nand the general choir of English girls for not doing. A female saint,\nspecially renowned in France, had, for a reason as weighty as Joanna’s,\nviz., expressly to shield her modesty amongst men, wore a male military\nharness. That reason and that example authorized La Pucelle; but our\nEnglish girls, as a body, have seldom any such reason, and certainly no\nsuch saintly example, to plead. This excuses them. Yet, still, if it is\nindispensable to the national character that our young women should now and\nthen trespass over the frontier of decorum, it then becomes a patriotic\nduty in me to assure M. Michelet that we have such ardent females amongst\nus, and in a long series–some detected in naval hospitals, when too sick\nto remember their disguise; some on fields of battle; multitudes never\ndetected at all; some only suspected; and others discharged without noise\nby war offices and other absurd people. In our navy, both royal and\ncommercial, and generally from deep remembrances of slighted love, women\nhave sometimes served in disguise for many years, taking contentedly their\ndaily allowance of burgoo, biscuit, or cannon balls–anything, in short,\ndigestible or indigestible, that it might please Providence to send. One\nthing, at least, is to their credit: never any of these poor masks, with\ntheir deep silent remembrances, have been detected through murmuring, or\nwhat is nautically understood by “skulking.” So, for once, M. Michelet has\nan erratum to enter upon the fly-leaf of his book in presentation copies.",
        "4. But the last of these ebullitions is the most lively. We English, at\nOrleans, and after Orleans (which is not quite so extraordinary, if all\nwere told,) fled before the Maid of Arc. Yes, says M. Michelet, you did:\ndeny it, if you can. Deny it, my dear? I don’t mean to deny it. Running\naway, in many cases, is a thing so excellent, that no philosopher would,\nat times, condescend to adopt any other step. All of us nations in Europe,\nwithout one exception, have shown our philosophy in that way at times. Even\npeople, ’qui ne se rendent pas,” have deigned both to run and to shout,\n“Sauve qui pent” at odd times of sunset; though, for my part, I have\nno pleasure in recalling unpleasant remembrances to brave men; and yet,\nreally, being so philosophic, they ought not to be unpleasant. But\nthe amusing feature in M. Michelet’s reproach, is the way in which he\nimproves and varies against us the charge of running, as if he were\nsinging a catch. Listen to him. They ’showed their backs,” did these\nEnglish. (Hip, hip, hurrah! three times three!) ’Behind good walls, they\nlet themselves be taken,” (Hip, hip! nine times nine!) They ’ran as\nfast as their legs could carry them.” (Hurrah! twenty-seven times\ntwenty-seven!) They ’ran before a girl;” they did. (Hurrah! eighty-one\ntimes eighty-one!) This reminds one of criminal indictments on the old\nmodel in English courts, where (for fear the prisoner should escape) the\ncrown lawyer varied the charge perhaps through forty counts. The law laid\nits guns so as to rake the accused at every possible angle. Whilst the\nindictment was reading, he seemed a monster of crime in his own eyes; and\nyet, after all, the poor fellow had but committed one offence, and not\nalways that. N.B.–Not having the French original at hand, I make my\nquotations from a friend’s copy of Mr. Walter Kelly’s translation, which\nseems to me faithful, spirited, and idiomatically English–liable, in fact,\nonly to the single reproach of occasional provincialisms.",
