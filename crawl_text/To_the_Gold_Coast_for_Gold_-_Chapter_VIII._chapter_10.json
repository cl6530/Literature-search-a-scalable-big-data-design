        "TO GRAND CANARY–LAS PALMAS, THE CAPITAL.",
        "At noon (January 10) the British and African s.s. Senegal weighed\nfor Grand Canary, which stood in unusually distinct relief to the east,\nand which, this time, was not moated by a tumbling sea. Usually it is;\nmoreover, it lies hidden by a bank of French-grey clouds, here and there\nsun-gilt and wind-bleached. We saw the ’Pike’ bury itself under the blue\nhorizon, at first cloaked in its wintry ermines and then capped with\nfleecy white nimbus, which confused itself with the snows.",
        "I had now a good opportunity of observing my fellow-passengers bound\ndown south. They consisted of the usual four classes–naval, military,\ncolonial officials, and commercials. The latter I noted narrowly as the\nquondam good Shepherd of the so-called ’Palm-oil Lambs.’ All were young\nfellows without a sign of the old trader, and well-mannered enough. When\nreturning homewards, however, their society was by no means so pleasant;\nit was noisy, and ’larky,’ besides being addicted to the dullest\npractical jokes, such as peppering beds. On board Senegal each\nsat at meat with his glass of Adam’s ale by his plate-side, looking\nprim, and grave, and precise as persons at a christening who are not in\nthe habit of frequenting christenings. Captain Keene took the earliest\nopportunity of assuring me that since my time–indeed, since the last\nten years–the Bights and the Bightsmen had greatly changed; that\nspirit-drinking was utterly unknown, and that ten-o’clock-go-to-bed life\nwas the general rule. But this unnatural state of things did not last\nlong. Wine, beer, and even Martell (three stars) presently reappeared;\nand I noted that the evening-chorus had preserved all its peculiar\nverve. The fact is that West Africa has been subjected to the\nhateful espionage, that prying into private affairs, which dates in\nWestern India from the days of a certain nameless governor. Every\nattempt at jollification was reported to the houses at home, and often\nan evil rumour against a man went to Liverpool and returned to ’the\nCoast’ before it was known to himself and his friends in the same\nriver. May all such dismal attempts to make Jack and Jill dull boys and\ngirls fail as utterly!",
        "Early in the afternoon we steamed past Galdar and La Guia, rival\nvillages famed for cheeses on the north-western coast of lumpy Grand\nCanary, sheets of habitation gleaming white at the feet of their\nrespective brown montañetas. The former was celebrated in local\nstory; its Guanche guanarteme, or great chief, as opposed to the\nsubordinate mencey, being one of the two potentates in ’Tameran,’\nthe self-styled ’Island of Braves.’ This, too, was the site of the\nTahoro, or Tagoror, temple and senate-house of the ancients. The\nprincipal interest of these wild people is the mysterious foreknowledge\nof their fate that seems to have come to them by a manner of intuition,\nof uninspired prophecy. [Footnote: So in Candelaria of Tenerife the\nVirgin appeared in effigy to the shepherds of Chimisay in 1392, a\ncentury before the Norman Conquest, and dwelt fifty-four years amongst\nthe Gentiles of Chinguaro. At least so say DD. Juan Nuñez de la Peña\n(Conquista i Antiguidades de la Gran Canaria, &c., Madrid, 1676);\nAntonio Viana (Antiguidades de las Islas Afortunadas, &c.,\nSeville, 1604) in his heroic poem, and Fray Alonzo de Espinosa\n(Historia de la Aparicion y Milagres de la Imagem de N.S. de\nCandelaria). The learned and unprejudiced Canon Viera y Clavijo\n(Noticias de la Historia geral de las Islas de Canaria, 3 vols.)\nbravely doubts whether reason and sane criticism had flourished together\nin those times.]",
        "In the clear winter-air we could distinctly trace the bold contour of\nthe upper heights tipped by the central haystack, El Nublo, a giant\ntrachytic monolith. We passed Confital Bay, whose ’comfits’ are galettes\nof stone, and gave a wide berth to the Isleta and its Sphinx’s\nhead. This rocky peninsula, projecting sharply from the north-eastern\nchord of the circle, is outlined by a dangerous reef, and drops suddenly\ninto 130 fathoms. Supported on the north by great columns of basalt, it\nis the terminus of a secondary chain, trending north-east–south-west,\nand meeting the Cumbre, or highest ground, whose strike is\nnorth-west–south-east. Like the knuckle-bone of the Tenerife ham it is\na contorted mass of red and black lavas and scoriae, with sharp slides\nand stone-floods still distinctly traceable. Of its five eruptive cones\nthe highest, which supports the Atalaya Vieja, or old look-out, now the\nsignal-station, rises to 1,200 feet. A fine lighthouse, with detached\nquarters for the men, crowns another crater-top to the north. The grim\nblock wants water at this season, when the thinnest coat of green\nclothes its black-red forms. La Isleta appears to have been a\nburial-ground of the indigenes, who, instead of stowing away their\nmummies in caves, built detached sepulchres and raised tumuli of scoriae\nover their embalmed dead. As at Peruvian Arica, many remains have been\nexposed by modern earthquakes and landslips.",
        "Rounding the Islet, and accompanied by curious canoes like paper-boats,\nand by fishing-craft which bounded over the waves like dolphins, we spun\nby the Puerto de la Luz, a line of flat-topped whitewashed houses, the\nonly remarkable feature being the large and unused Lazaretto. A few\nbarques still lie off the landing-place, where I have been compelled\nmore than once to take refuge. In my day it was proposed to cut a\nship-canal through the low neck of barren sand, which bears nothing but\na ’chapparal’ of tamarisk. During the last twenty years, however, the\nisthmus has been connected with the mainland by a fine causeway, paved\nwith concrete, and by an excellent highroad. The sand of the neck,\nthrown by the winds high up the cliffs which back the city, evidently\ndates from the days when La Isleta was an island. It contrasts sharply\nwith the grey basaltic shingle that faces the capital and forms the\nship-building yard.",
        "We coasted along the yellow lowland, with its tormented background of\ntall cones, bluffs, and falaises; and we anchored, at 4 P.M., in\nthe roadstead of Las Palmas, north of the spot where our\ns.s. Senegal whilom broke her back. The capital, fronting east,\nlike Santa Cruz, lies at the foot of a high sea-wall, whose straight and\nsloping lines betray their submarine origin: in places it is caverned\nfor quarries and for the homes of the troglodyte artisans; and up its\nflanks straggle whitewashed boxes towards the local necropolis. The\ndryness of the atmosphere destroys aerial perspective; and the view\nlooks flat as a scene-painting. The terraced roofs suggest to Britishers\nthat the top-floor has been blown off. Las Palmas is divided into two\nhalves, northern and southern, by a grim black wady, like the Madeiran\nribeiras, [Footnote: According to the usual law of the neo-Latin\nlanguages, ’ribeiro’ (masc.) is a small cleft, ’ribeira’ (fem.) is a\nlarge ravine.] the ’Giniguada,’ or Barranco de la Ciudad, the normal\ngrisly gashes in the background curtain. The eye-striking buildings are\nthe whitewashed Castillo del Rey, a flat fort of antique structure\ncrowning the western heights and connected by a broken wall with the\nCasa Mata, or platform half-way down: it is backed by a larger and\nstronger work, the Castillo de Sant’ Ana. The next notability is the new\ntheatre, large enough for any European capital. Lastly, an immense and\ngloomy pile, the Cathedral rises conspicuously from the white sheet of\ncity, all cubes and windows. Clad in a suit of sombrest brown patched\nwith plaster, with its domelet and its two towers of basalt very far\napart. This fane is unhappily fronted westward, the high altar facing\nJerusalem. And thus it turns its back upon the world of voyagers.",
        "In former days, when winds and waves were high, we landed on the sands\nnear the dark grey Castillo de la Luz, in the Port of Light. Thence we\nhad to walk, ride, or drive–when a carriage was to be hired–over the\nfour kilomètres which separated us from the city. We passed the Castles\nof San Fernando and La Catalina to the villas and the gardens planted\nwith thin trees that outlie the north; and we entered the capital by a\nneat bridge thrown over the Barranco de la Mata, where a wall from the\nupper castle once kept out the doughty aborigines. Thence we fell into\nthe northern quarter, La Triana, and found shabby rooms and shocking\nfare either at the British Hotel (Mrs. Bishop) or the Hôtel Monson–both\nno more. Now we land conveniently, thanks to Dons Santiago Verdugo and\nJuan Leon y Castilhos, at a spur of the new pier with the red light, to\nthe north of the city, and find ourselves at once in the streets. For\nmany years this comfortable mole excited the strongest opposition: it\nwas wasting money, and the stones, carelessly thrown in, would at once\nbe carried off by the sea and increase the drenching breakers which\noutlie the beach. Time has, as usual, settled the dispute. It is now\nbeing prolonged eastwards; but again they say that the work is swept\naway as soon as done; that the water is too deep, and even that sinking\na ship loaded with stones would not resist the strong arm of Eurus, who\nburies everything in surf. The mole is provided with the normal\nSanidad, or health office, with solid magazines, and with a\ncivilised tramway used to transport the huge cubes of concrete. At the\ntongue-root is a neat little garden, wanting only shade: two\ndragon-trees here attract the eye. Thence we pass at once into the main\nline, La Triana, which bisects the commercial town. This reminiscence of\nthe Seville suburb begins rather like a road than a street, but it ends\nwith the inevitable cobble-stones. The trottoirs, we remark, are\nof flags disposed lengthways; in the rival Island they lie\ncrosswise. The thoroughfares are scrupulously named, after Spanish\nfashion; in Fernando Po they labelled even the bush-roads. The\nsubstantial houses with green balconies are white, bound in brown\nedgings of trachyte, basalt, and lava: here and there a single story of\nrude construction stands like a dwarf by the side of its giant\nneighbour.",
        "The huge and still unfinished cathedral is well worth a visit. It is\ncalled after Santa Ana, a personage in this island. When Grand Canary\nhad been attacked successively and to scant purpose by De Béthencourt\n(1402), by Diego de Herrera (1464), and by Diego de Silva, the Catholic\nQueen and King sent, on January 24, 1474, Don Juan Rejon to finish the\nwork. This Conquistador, a morose and violent man, was marching\nupon the west of the island, where his reception would have been of the\nwarmest, when he was met at the site of the present Ermita de San\nAntonio by an old fisherman, who advised him of his danger. He took\nwarning, fortified his camp, which occupied the site of the present\ncity, beat off the enemy, and defeated, at the battle of Giniguada, a\nleague of chiefs headed by the valiant and obstinate Doramas. The\nfisherman having suddenly disappeared, incontinently became a miraculous\napparition of the Virgin’s mother. Rejon founded the cathedral in her\nhonour; but he was not destined to rest in it. He was recalled to\nSpain. He attacked Grand Canary three times, and as often failed; at\nlast he left it, and after all his campaigns he was killed and buried at\nGomera. Nor, despite Saint Anne, did the stout islanders yield to Pedro\nde Vera (1480-83) till they had fought an eighty years’ fight for\nindependence.",
        "The cathedral, which Mr. P. Barker Webb compares with the Church of\nSt. Sulpice, is built of poor schiste and bad sandstone-rubble, revetted\nwith good lava and basalt. The latter material here takes in age a fine\nmellow creamy coat, as in the ’giant cities’ of the Hauran, the absurd\ntitle of Mr. Porter. The order is Ionic below, Corinthian above, and the\npile sadly wants a dome instead of a pepper-caster domelet. One of the\ntowers was finished only forty-five years ago, and a Scotch merchant\nadded, much to his disgust, a weather-cock. In the interior green, blue,\nand yellow glass tempers the austerity of the whitewashed walls and the\ngloom of the grey basaltic columns, bindings, and ceiling-ribbings.\nConcerning the ceiling, which prettily imitates an archwork\nof trees, they tell the following tale. The Bishop and Chapter,\nhaving resolved in 1500 to repair the work of Don Diego Montaude,\nentrusted the work to Don Diego Nicholas Eduardo, of Laguna, an\nHispano-Hibernian–according to the English. This young architect built\nwith so light a hand that the masons struck work till he encouraged them\nby sitting beneath his own creation. The same, they say, was done at\nBelem, Lisbon. The interior is Gothic, unlike all others in the islands;\nand the piers, lofty and elegant, imitate palm-fronds, a delicate\nflattery to ’Las Palmas’ and a good specimen of local invention. There\nare a nave and two aisles: four noble transversal columns sustaining the\nchoir-vault adorn the walls. The pulpit and high altar are admirable as\nthe choir; the only eyesores are the diminutive organ and the eleven\nside-chapels with their caricatures of high art. The large and\nheavily-railed choir in mid-nave, so common in the mother country,\nbreaks the unity of the place and dwarfs its grand proportions. After\nthe manner of Spanish churches, which love to concentrate dazzling\ncolour at the upper end, the high altar is hung with crimson velvet\ncurtains; and its massive silver lamps (one Italian, presented by\nCardinal Ximenes), salvers, altar-facings, and other fixings are said to\nhave cost over 24,000 francs. The lectern is supposed to have been\npreserved from the older cathedral.",
        "There are other curiosities in this building. The sacristy, supported by\nside-walls on the arch principle, and ceilinged with stone instead of\nwood, is shown as a minor miracle. The vestry contains gigantic\nwardrobes, full of ladies’ delights–marvellous vestments, weighted with\nmassive braidings of gold and silver, most delicate handwork in every\nimaginable colour and form. There are magnificent donations of\ncrucifixes and candlesticks, cups, goblets, and other vessels required\nby the church services–all the result of private piety. In the Chapel\nof St. Catherine, built at his own expense, lies buried Cairasco, the\nbard whom Cervantes recognised as his master in style. His epitaph,\ndating A.D. 1610, reads–",
        "A statue to him was erected opposite the old ’Cairasco Theatre’ in\n1876. Under the grand altar, with other dignitaries of the cathedral,\nare the remains of the learned and amiable historian of the isles, Canon\nJosé de Viera y Clavigo, born at Lanzarote, poet, ’elegant translator’\nof Buffon, lexicographer, and honest man.",
        "Directly facing the cathedral-façade is the square, headed by the\nAyuntamiento, an Ionic building which would make a first-rate\nhotel. Satirical Britishers declare that it was copied from one of Day\nand Martin’s labels. The old townhall was burnt in 1842, and of its\nvaluable documents nothing was saved. On the right of the plaza is an\nhumble building, the episcopal palace, founded in 1578 by Bishop\nCristobal de la Vega. It was rebuilt by his successor, Cristobal de la\nCamara, who forbade the pretty housekeeper, prohibited his priests from\nentering nunneries, and prescribed public confessionals–a measure still\nmuch to be desired. But he must have been a man of extreme views, for he\nactually proscribed gossip. This was some thirty years after Admiral van\nder Does and his Dutchmen fired upon the city and were beaten off with a\nloss of 2,000 men.",
        "South of the cathedral, and in Colegio Street (so called from the\nAugustine college, [Footnote: There is still a college of that name\nwhere meteorological observations are regularly made.] now converted\ninto a tribunal), we find a small old house with heavily barred\nwindows–the ex-Inquisition. This also has been desecrated into\nutility. The Holy Office began in 1504, and became a free tribunal in\n1567. Its palace was here founded in 1659 by Don José Balderan, and\nrestored in 1787 by Don Diego Nicholas Eduardo, whose fine fronting\nstaircase has been much admired. The Holy Tribunal broke up in 1820,\nwhen, the Constitution proving too strong for St. Dominic, the\ncollege-students mounted the belfry; and, amid the stupefaction of the\nshuddering multitude, joyously tolled its death-knell. All the material\nwas sold, even the large leather chairs with gilt nails used for\necclesiastical sitting. ’God defend us from its resurrection,’ mutters\nthe civil old huissier, as he leads us to the dungeons below through the\nmean court with its poor verandah propped on wooden posts. Part of it\nfacing the magistrates’ chapel was turned into a prison for petty\nmalefactors; and the two upper salas were converted into a\nprovisional Audiencia, or supreme court, large halls hung with\nthe portraits of the old governors. The new Audiencia at the\nbottom of Colegio Street, built by M. Botta at an expense of 20,000\ndollars, has a fine court with covered cloisters above and an open\ngallery below, supported by thin pillars of basalt.",
        "Resuming our walk down La Triana southwards, we note the grand new\ntheatre, not unlike that of Dresden: it wants only opening and a\ncompany. Then we cross the Giniguada wady by a bridge with a wooden\nfloor, iron railings, and stone piers, and enter the Viñeta, or\nofficial, as opposed to the commercial, town. On the south side is the\nfish-market, new, pretty, and gingerbread. It adjoins the general\nmarket, a fine, solid old building like that of Santa Cruz, containing\nbakers’ and butchers’ stalls, and all things wanted by the\nhousekeeper. A little beyond it the Triana ends in an archway leading to\na square court, under whose shaded sides mules and asses are\ntethered. We turn to the right and gain Balcones Street, where stands\nthe comfortable hotel of Don Ramon Lopez. Most soothing to the eye is\nthe cool green-grown patio after the prospect of the hot and\nbarren highlands which back the Palm-City.",
        "Walking up the right flank of the Giniguada Ribeira, we cross the old\nstone bridge with three arches and marble statues of the four\nseasons. It places us in the Plazuela, the irregular space which leads\nto the Mayor de Triana, the square of the old theatre. The western side\nis occupied by a huge yellow building, the old Church and Convent of San\nFrancisco, now turned into barracks. In parts it is battlemented; and\nits belfry, a wall of basalt pierced with a lancet-arch to hang bells,\nhints at earthquakes. An inscription upon the old theatre, the usual\nneat building of white and grey-brown basalt, informs us that it was\nbuilt in 1852, ad honorem of two deputies. But Santa Cruz, the\nmodern capital, has provided herself with a larger and a better house;\nergo Las Palmas, the old capital, must fain do the same. The\nmetropolis of Grand Canary, moreover, claims to count more noses than\nthat of Tenerife. To the west of the older theatre, in the same block,\nis the casino, club, and ball-room, with two French billiard-tables and\nsmoking-rooms. The old hotel attached to the theatre has now ceased to\nexist.",
        "On the opposite side of the square lies the little Alameda promenade,\nthe grounds once belonging to St. Francis. The raised walk, shaded by a\npretty arch-way of palm-trees, is planted with myrtles, dahlias, and\nbignonias. It has all the requisites of its kind–band-stand,\ngreen-posted oil-lamps, and scrolled seats of brown basalt. Round this\nsquare rise the best houses, mostly new; as in the Peninsula, however,\nas well as in both archipelagos, all have shops below. We are beginning\nto imitate this excellent practice of utilising the unwholesome\nground-floor in the big new hotels of London. Two large houses are, or\nwere, painted to mimic brick, things as hideous as anything further\nnorth.",
        "In this part of the Triana lived the colony of English merchants, once\nso numerous that they had their own club and gymnasium. All had taken\nthe local colouring, and were more Spanish than the Spaniards. A\ncelebrated case of barratry was going on in 1863, the date of my first\nvisit, when Lloyds sent out a detective and my friend Capt. Heathcote,\nI.N., to conduct the legal proceedings. I innocently asked why the\nBritish vice-consul was not sufficient, and was assured that no resident\ncould interfere, alias dared do his duty, under pain of social\nostracism and a host of enmities. In those days a man who gained his\nlawsuit went about weaponed and escorted, as in modern Ireland, by a\ntroop of armed servants. Landlord-potting also was by no means unknown;\nand the murder of the Marquess de las Palmas caused memorable sensation.",
        "Indescribable was the want of hospitality which characterised the\nHispano-Englishmen of Las Palmas. I have called twice upon a\nfellow-countryman without his dreaming of asking me upstairs. Such\nshyness may be understood in foreigners, who often entertain wild ideas\nconcerning what an Englishman expects. But these people were wealthy;\nnor were they wholly expatriated. Finally, it was with the utmost\ndifficulty that I obtained from one of them a pound of home-grown\narrowroot for the sick child of a friend.",
        "On the other hand, I have ever met with the greatest civility from the\nSpanish Canarians. I am especially indebted to Don J. B. Carlo, the\npacket-agent, who gave me copies of ’El Museo Canario, Revista de la\nSociedad del mismo nombre’ (Las Palmas)–the transactions published by\nthe Museum of Las Palmas. Two mummies of Canarian origin have lately\nbeen added to the collection, and the library has become\nrespectable. The steamers are now so hurried that I had no time to\ninspect it, nor to call upon Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo, President of\nthe Anthropological Society. This savant, whose name has become well\nknown in Paris, is printing at Las Palmas his ’Estudios Historicos,’\n&c., the outcome of a life’s labour. Don Agustin Millares is also\npublishing ’La Historia de las Islas Canarias,’ in three volumes, each\nof 400 to 450 pages.",
        "I made three short excursions in Grand Canary to Telde, to the Caldera,\nand to Doramas, which showed me the formation of the island. My notes\ntaken at the time must now be quoted. En route for the former, we\ndrove past the large city-hospital: here in old times was another strong\nwall, defending the southern part, and corresponding with the northern\nor Barranco line. The road running to the south-south-west was\npeculiarly good; the tunnel through the hill-spur suggested classical\nand romantic Posilippo. It was well parapeted near the sea, and it had\nheavy cuttings in the white tosca, a rock somewhat resembling the\ncalcaire grossier of the Paris basin. This light pumice-like\nstone, occasionally forming a conglomerate or pudding, and slightly\neffervescing with acids, is fertile where soft, and where hard quite\nsterile. Hereabouts lay Gando, one of the earliest forts built by the\nConquistadores. We then bent inland, or westward, crossed barren\nstony ground, red and black, and entered the pretty and fertile valley\nwith its scatter of houses known as La Vega de Ginamar.",
        "I obtained a guide, and struck up the proper right of a modern lava-bed\nwhich does not reach the sea. The path wound around rough hills, here\nand there scattered with fig-trees and vines, with lupines, euphorbias,\nand other wild growths. From the summit of the southern front we sighted\nthe Cima de Ginamar, popularly called El Pozo (the Well). It is a\nvolcanic blowing-hole of oval shape, about fifty feet in long diameter,\nand the elliptical mouth discharged to the north the lava-bed before\nseen. Apparently it is connected with the Bandana Peak, further\nwest. Here the aborigines martyred sundry friars before the\nConquistadores ’divided land and water’ amongst them. The guide\ndeclared that the hole must reach the sea, which lies at least 1,200\nfeet below; that the sound of water is often to be heard in it, and that\nmen, let down to recover the corpses of cattle, had been frightened away\nby strange sights and sounds. He threw in stones, explaining that they\nmust be large, otherwise they lodge upon the ledges. I heard them dash,\ndash, dash from side to side, at various intervals of different depths,\ntill the pom-om-m subsided into silence. The crevasses showed no sign of\nthe rock-pigeon (Columba livia), a bird once abounding. Nothing\ncould be weirder than the effect of the scene in clear moonlight: the\ncontrast of snowy beams and sable ground perfectly suited the uncanny\nlook and the weird legends of the site.",
        "Beyond the Cima we made the gay little town of Telde, which lodges some\n4,000 souls, entering it by a wide fiumara, over which a bridge\nwas then building. The streets were mere lines of scattered houses, and\nthe prominent buildings were the white dome of San Pedro and San Juan\nwith its two steeples of the normal grey basalt. Near the latter lay the\nlittle Alameda, beggar-haunted as usual. On the north side of the\nBarranco rose a caverned rock inhabited by the poor. We shall see this\ntroglodytic feature better developed elsewhere.",
        "To visit the Caldera de Bandana, three miles from the city, we hired a\ncarriage with the normal row of three lean rats, which managed, however,\nto canter or gallop the greater part of the way. The boy-driver,\nAgustin, was a fair specimen of his race, obstinate as a Berber or a\nmule. As it was Sunday he wanted to halt at every venta (pub),\ncurioseando–that is, admiring the opposite sex. Some of the\nyounger girls are undoubtedly pretty, yet they show unmistakable signs\nof Guanche blood. The toilette is not becoming: here the shawl takes the\nplace of the mantilla, and the head-covering, as in Tenerife, is capped\nby the hideous billycock. To all my remonstrances Don Agustin curtly\nreplied with the usual island formula, ’Am I a slave?’ This class has a\nsurly, grumbling way, utterly wanting the dignity of the lower-order\nSpaniard and the Moor; and it is to be managed only by threatening to\nwithhold the propinas (tip). But the jarvey, like the bath-man,\nthe barber, and generally the body-servant and the menial classes which\nwait upon man’s person, are not always models of civility.",
        "We again passed the hospital and ascended the new zigzag to the right of\nthe Giniguada. The torrent-bed, now bright green with arum and pepper,\ngrows vegetables, maize, and cactus. Its banks bear large plantations of\nthe dates from which Las Palmas borrows her pretty Eastern names. In\nmost places they are mere brabs, and, like the olive, they fail to\nfruit. The larger growths are barbarously docked, as in Catholic\ncountries generally; and the fronds are reduced to mere brooms and\nrats’-tails. The people are not fond of palms; the shade and the roots,\nthey say, injure their crops, and the tree is barely worth one dollar\nper annum.",
        "At the top of the Cuesta de San Roque, which reminded me of its namesake\nnear Gibraltar, I found a barren ridge growing only euphorbia. The\nBarranco Seco, on the top, showed in the sole a conspicuously big house\nwhich has no other view but the sides of a barren trough. This was the\n’folly’ of an eccentric nobleman, who preferred the absence to the\ncompany of his friends.",
        "Half an hour’s cold, bleak drive placed us at the Tafira village. Here\nthe land yields four crops a year, two of maize and two of\npotatoes. Formerly worth $100 per acre, the annual value had been raised\nby cochineal to $500. All, however, depends upon water, which is\nenormously dear. The yelping curs have mostly bushy tails, like those\nwhich support the arms of the Canary Islands. The grey and green finches\nrepresent our ’domestic warbler’ (Fringilla canaria), which\nreached England about 1500, when a ship with a few birds on board had\nbeen wrecked off Elba.",
        "[Footnote: The canary bird builds, on tall bushes rather than trees, a\nnest of moss, roots, feathers and rubbish, where it lays from four to\nsix pale-blue eggs. It moults in August and September; pairs in\nFebruary, and sometimes hatches six times in a season. The natives\ndeclare that the wild birds rarely survive the second year of captivity;\nyet they do not seem to suffer from it, as they begin to sing at once\nwhen caged. Mr. Addison describes the note as ’between that of the\nskylark and the nightingale,’ and was surprised to find that each flock\nhas a different song–an observation confirmed by the people and noted\nby Humboldt (p. 87).]",
        "The country folk were habited in shirts, drawers derived from the Moors,\nand tasseled caps of blue stuff, big enough for carpet-bags. The vine\nstill covered every possible slope of black soil, and the aloes, crowned\nwith flowers, seemed to lord it over the tamarisks, the hemlocks, and\nthe nightshades.",
        "Upon this monte, or wooded height, most of the gentry have\ncountry-houses, the climate being 12 degrees (Fahr.) cooler than by the\nsea. La Brigida commands a fine view of the Isleta, with its black sand\nand white foam, leek-green waters upon the reefs, and deep offing of\nsteely blue.",
        "Leaving the carriage at the forking road, I mounted, after a bad\ndescent, a rough hill, and saw to the left the Pico de Bandana, a fine\nregular cone 1,850 feet high. A group of a few houses, El Pueblo de la\nCaldera, leads to the famous Cauldron, which Sir Charles Lyell visited\nby mistake for that of Palma. Travellers compare it with the lakes of\nNemi and Albano: I found it tame after the cup of Fernando Po with its\nbeautiful lining of hanging woods. It has only the merit of\nregularity. The unbroken upper rim measures about half a mile in\ndiameter, and the lower funnel 3,000 feet in circumference. The sides of\npiedra pomez (pumice) are lined and ribbed with rows of\nscoriaceous rock as regular as amphitheatre-seats, full 1,000 feet deep,\nand slope easily into a flat sole, which some are said to have reached\non horseback. A copious fountain, springing from the once fiery inside,\nis collected below for the use of the farm-house, El Fondo de la\nCaldera. The fields have the effect of a little Alpine tarn of bright\ngreen. Here wild pigeons are sometimes caught at night, and rabbits and\npartridges are or were not extinct. I ascended Bandana Peak to the\nnorth-north-east, the piton of this long extinct volcano, and\nenjoyed the prospect of the luxuriant vegetation, the turquoise sea, and\nthe golden sands about Maspalomas, the southernmost extremity of Grand\nCanary.",
        "Returning to the road-fork, I mounted a hill on the right hand and\nsighted the Atalaya, another local lion. Here a perpendicular face of\ncalcareous rock fronts a deep valley, backed by a rounded hill, with the\nblue chine of El Cumbre in the distance: this is the highest of the\nridge, measuring 8,500 feet. The wall is pierced, like the torrent-side\nof Mar Saba (Jerusalem), with caves that shelter a troglodyte population\nnumbering some 2,000 souls. True to their Berber origin, they seek\nrefuge in the best of savage lodgings from heat, cold, and wind. The\nsite rises some 2,000 feet above sea-level, and the strong wester twists\nthe trees. Grand Canary preserves more of these settlements than\nTenerife; they are found in many parts of the island, and even close to\nthe capital. Madeira, on the other hand, affects them but little. We\nmust not forget that they still exist at St. Come, within two hours’\nrail of Paris, where my learned and lamented friend Dr. Broca had a\ncountry-house.",
        "Descending a rough, steep slope, I entered the upper tier of the\nsettlement, where the boxes were built up with whitewashed fronts. The\ncaves are mostly divided by matting into ’buts’ and ’bens.’ Heaps of\npots, antiquated in shape and somewhat like the Etruscan, showed the\ntrade of the place, and hillocks of potatoes the staff of life. The\nside-walls were hollowed for shelves, and a few prints of the Virgin and\nother sacred subjects formed the decoration. Settles and rude tables\ncompleted the list of movables; and many had the huge bed affected by\nthe Canarian cottager, which must be ascended with a run and a jump. The\npredatory birds, gypsies and others, flocked down from their nests,\nclamouring for cuartitos and taking no refusal.",
        "It occupies a week to ride round the island, whose circumference\nmeasures about 120 miles. I contented myself with a last excursion to\nDoramas, which then supplied meat, cheese, and grain to Tenerife. My\nguide was old Antonio Martinez, who assured me that he was the ’most\nclassical man’ in the island; and with two decent hill-ponies we struck\nto the north-west. There is little to describe in the tour. The Cuesta\nBlanca showed us the regular cones of Arúcas. Beyond Tenoya town I\ninspected a crateriform ravine, and Monte Cardones boasted a honeycomb\nof caves like the Atalaya. The fine rich vega of Arúcas, a long\nwhite settlement before whose doors rose drying heaps of maize and black\ncochineal, was a pleasant, smiling scene. All the country settlements\nare built pretty much upon the same plan: each has its Campo Santo with\nwhite walls and high grey gate, through which the coffin is escorted by\nGaucho-like riders, who dismount to enter. Doramas proved to be a fine\nmonte, with tree-stumps, especially chestnuts, somewhat\nsurprising in a region of ferns and furze. Near the little village of\nFriga I tasted an agua agria, a natural sodawater, which the\npeople hold to be of sovereign value for beast as well as man. It\nincreases digestion and makes happy mothers, like the fountain of\nVillaflor on the Tenerifan ’Pike ’-slope. I found it resembling an\neau gazeuse left in the open all night. We then pushed on to\nTeror, famous for turkeys, traversed the high and forested northern\nplateau, visited Galdar and Guia of the cheeses, and rode back by\nBañaderos Bay and the Cuesta da Silva, renowned in olden island story.",
        "These three days gave me a fair general view of Grand Canary. The\nCumbre, or central plateau, whose apex is Los Pexos (6,400 feet), well\nwooded with pines and Alpines, collects moisture in abundance. From this\nplateau barrancos, or ravine-valleys, said to number 103, radiate\nquaquaversally. Their bottoms, becoming more and more level as they near\nthe sea, are enriched by gushing founts, and are unrivalled for\nfertility, while the high and stony intervening ridges are barren as\nArabia Deserta. Even sun and rain cannot fertilise the dividing walls of\nthe rich and riant vegas. Here, as at Madeira, and showing even a\nbetter likeness, the tierra caliente is Egypt, the mediania\n(middle-heights) are Italy, and the upper mesetas, the cloud-compelling\ntable-lands, are the bleak north of Europe plus a quasi-tropical sun.",
