        "Know you not that the thing is a warfare? one man’s duty is\nto mount guard, another must go out to reconnoitre, a third to\nbattle; all cannot be in one place, nor would it even be\nexpedient. But you, instead of executing your Commander’s orders,\ncomplain if aught harsher than usual is enjoined; not\nunderstanding to what condition you are bringing the army, so far\nas in you lies. If all were to follow your example, none would\ndig a trench, none would cast a rampart around the camp, none\nwould keep watch, or expose himself to danger; but all turn out\nuseless for the service of war. . . . Thus it is here also. Every\nlife is a warfare, and that long and various. You must fulfil a\nsoldier’s duty, and obey each order at your commander’s nod: aye,\nif it be possible, divine what he would have done; for between\nthat Commander and this, there is no comparison, either in might or\nin excellence.",
