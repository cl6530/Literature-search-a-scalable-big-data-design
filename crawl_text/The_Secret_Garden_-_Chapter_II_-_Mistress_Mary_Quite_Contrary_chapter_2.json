        "Mary had liked to look at her mother from a distance\nand she had thought her very pretty, but as she knew\nvery little of her she could scarcely have been expected\nto love her or to miss her very much when she was gone.\nShe did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a\nself-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself,\nas she had always done.  If she had been older she would\nno doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in\nthe world, but she was very young, and as she had always\nbeen taken care of, she supposed she always would be.\nWhat she thought was that she would like to know if she was\ngoing to nice people, who would be polite to her and give\nher her own way as her Ayah and the other native servants\nhad done.",
        "She knew that she was not going to stay at the English\nclergyman’s house where she was taken at first.  She did\nnot want to stay.  The English clergyman was poor and he\nhad five children nearly all the same age and they wore\nshabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching\ntoys from each other.  Mary hated their untidy bungalow\nand was so disagreeable to them that after the first day\nor two nobody would play with her.  By the second day\nthey had given her a nickname which made her furious.",
        "It was Basil who thought of it first.  Basil was a little\nboy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary\nhated him.  She was playing by herself under a tree,\njust as she had been playing the day the cholera broke out.\nShe was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden\nand Basil came and stood near to watch her.  Presently he\ngot rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.",
        "“Why don’t you put a heap of stones there and pretend\nit is a rockery?” he said.  “There in the middle,\"\nand he leaned over her to point.",
        "“Go away!” cried Mary.  “I don’t want boys.  Go away!”",
        "For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease.\nHe was always teasing his sisters.  He danced round\nand round her and made faces and sang and laughed.",
        "         “Mistress Mary, quite contrary,\n          How does your garden grow?\n          With silver bells, and cockle shells,\n          And marigolds all in a row.”",
        "He sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too;\nand the crosser Mary got, the more they sang “Mistress Mary,\nquite contrary\"; and after that as long as she stayed\nwith them they called her “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary\"\nwhen they spoke of her to each other, and often when they\nspoke to her.",
        "“You are going to be sent home,” Basil said to her,\n“at the end of the week.  And we’re glad of it.”",
        "“I am glad of it, too,” answered Mary.  “Where is home?”",
        "“She doesn’t know where home is!” said Basil,\nwith seven-year-old scorn.  “It’s England, of course.\nOur grandmama lives there and our sister Mabel was sent\nto her last year.  You are not going to your grandmama.\nYou have none.  You are going to your uncle.  His name is\nMr. Archibald Craven.”",
        "“I don’t know anything about him,” snapped Mary.",
        "“I know you don’t,” Basil answered.  “You don’t know anything.\nGirls never do.  I heard father and mother talking about him.\nHe lives in a great, big, desolate old house in the\ncountry and no one goes near him.  He’s so cross he won’t\nlet them, and they wouldn’t come if he would let them.\nHe’s a hunchback, and he’s horrid.” “I don’t believe you,\"\nsaid Mary; and she turned her back and stuck her fingers\nin her ears, because she would not listen any more.",
        "But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when\nMrs. Crawford told her that night that she was going\nto sail away to England in a few days and go to her uncle,\nMr. Archibald Craven, who lived at Misselthwaite Manor,\nshe looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that\nthey did not know what to think about her.  They tried\nto be kind to her, but she only turned her face away\nwhen Mrs. Crawford attempted to kiss her, and held\nherself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her shoulder.",
        "“She is such a plain child,” Mrs. Crawford said pityingly,\nafterward.  “And her mother was such a pretty creature.\nShe had a very pretty manner, too, and Mary has the most\nunattractive ways I ever saw in a child.  The children\ncall her `Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,’ and though\nit’s naughty of them, one can’t help understanding it.”",
        "“Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face\nand her pretty manners oftener into the nursery Mary\nmight have learned some pretty ways too.  It is very sad,\nnow the poor beautiful thing is gone, to remember that\nmany people never even knew that she had a child at all.”",
        "“I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,\"\nsighed Mrs. Crawford.  “When her Ayah was dead there\nwas no one to give a thought to the little thing.\nThink of the servants running away and leaving her all\nalone in that deserted bungalow.  Colonel McGrew said he\nnearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door\nand found her standing by herself in the middle of the room.”",
        "Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of\nan officer’s wife, who was taking her children to leave\nthem in a boarding-school. She was very much absorbed\nin her own little boy and girl, and was rather glad to hand\nthe child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven sent\nto meet her, in London.  The woman was his housekeeper\nat Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock.\nShe was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp\nblack eyes.  She wore a very purple dress, a black\nsilk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet\nwith purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled\nwhen she moved her head.  Mary did not like her at all,\nbut as she very seldom liked people there was nothing\nremarkable in that; besides which it was very evident\nMrs. Medlock did not think much of her.",
        "“My word! she’s a plain little piece of goods!” she said.\n“And we’d heard that her mother was a beauty.  She hasn’t\nhanded much of it down, has she, ma’am?” “Perhaps she\nwill improve as she grows older,” the officer’s wife\nsaid good-naturedly. “If she were not so sallow and had\na nicer expression, her features are rather good.\nChildren alter so much.”",
        "“She’ll have to alter a good deal,” answered Mrs. Medlock.\n“And, there’s nothing likely to improve children at\nMisselthwaite–if you ask me!” They thought Mary was not\nlistening because she was standing a little apart from them\nat the window of the private hotel they had gone to.\nShe was watching the passing buses and cabs and people,\nbut she heard quite well and was made very curious about\nher uncle and the place he lived in.  What sort of a place\nwas it, and what would he be like? What was a hunchback?\nShe had never seen one.  Perhaps there were none in India.",
        "Since she had been living in other people’s houses\nand had had no Ayah, she had begun to feel lonely\nand to think queer thoughts which were new to her.\nShe had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong\nto anyone even when her father and mother had been alive.\nOther children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers,\nbut she had never seemed to really be anyone’s little girl.\nShe had had servants, and food and clothes, but no one\nhad taken any notice of her.  She did not know that this\nwas because she was a disagreeable child; but then,\nof course, she did not know she was disagreeable.\nShe often thought that other people were, but she did not\nknow that she was so herself.",
        "She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person\nshe had ever seen, with her common, highly colored face\nand her common fine bonnet.  When the next day they set\nout on their journey to Yorkshire, she walked through\nthe station to the railway carriage with her head up\nand trying to keep as far away from her as she could,\nbecause she did not want to seem to belong to her.\nIt would have made her angry to think people imagined she\nwas her little girl.",
        "But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her\nand her thoughts.  She was the kind of woman who would\n“stand no nonsense from young ones.” At least, that is\nwhat she would have said if she had been asked.  She had\nnot wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria’s\ndaughter was going to be married, but she had a comfortable,\nwell paid place as housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor\nand the only way in which she could keep it was to do\nat once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do.\nShe never dared even to ask a question.",
        "“Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera,\"\nMr. Craven had said in his short, cold way.  “Captain Lennox\nwas my wife’s brother and I am their daughter’s guardian.\nThe child is to be brought here.  You must go to London\nand bring her yourself.”",
        "So she packed her small trunk and made the journey.",
        "Mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked\nplain and fretful.  She had nothing to read or to look at,\nand she had folded her thin little black-gloved hands in\nher lap.  Her black dress made her look yellower than ever,\nand her limp light hair straggled from under her black\ncrepe hat.",
        "“A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,\"\nMrs. Medlock thought.  (Marred is a Yorkshire word and\nmeans spoiled and pettish.) She had never seen a child\nwho sat so still without doing anything; and at last she\ngot tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk,\nhard voice.",
        "“I suppose I may as well tell you something about where\nyou are going to,” she said.  “Do you know anything\nabout your uncle?”",
        "“No,” said Mary.",
        "“Never heard your father and mother talk about him?”",
        "“No,” said Mary frowning.  She frowned because she\nremembered that her father and mother had never talked\nto her about anything in particular.  Certainly they\nhad never told her things.",
        "“Humph,” muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her queer,\nunresponsive little face.  She did not say any more for\na few moments and then she began again.",
        "“I suppose you might as well be told something–to\nprepare you.  You are going to a queer place.”",
        "Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather\ndiscomfited by her apparent indifference, but, after taking\na breath, she went on.",
        "“Not but that it’s a grand big place in a gloomy way,\nand Mr. Craven’s proud of it in his way–and that’s\ngloomy enough, too.  The house is six hundred years old\nand it’s on the edge of the moor, and there’s near a hundred\nrooms in it, though most of them’s shut up and locked.\nAnd there’s pictures and fine old furniture and things\nthat’s been there for ages, and there’s a big park round\nit and gardens and trees with branches trailing to the\nground–some of them.” She paused and took another breath.\n“But there’s nothing else,” she ended suddenly.",
        "Mary had begun to listen in spite of herself.  It all sounded\nso unlike India, and anything new rather attracted her.\nBut she did not intend to look as if she were interested.\nThat was one of her unhappy, disagreeable ways.  So she\nsat still.",
        "“Well,” said Mrs. Medlock.  “What do you think of it?”",
        "“Nothing,” she answered.  “I know nothing about such places.”",
        "That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.",
        "“Eh!” she said, “but you are like an old woman.\nDon’t you care?”",
        "“It doesn’t matter” said Mary, “whether I care or not.”",
        "“You are right enough there,” said Mrs. Medlock.\n“It doesn’t. What you’re to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor\nfor I don’t know, unless because it’s the easiest way.\nHe’s not going to trouble himself about you, that’s sure\nand certain.  He never troubles himself about no one.”",
        "She stopped herself as if she had just remembered something\nin time.",
        "“He’s got a crooked back,” she said.  “That set him wrong.\nHe was a sour young man and got no good of all his money\nand big place till he was married.”",
        "Mary’s eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention\nnot to seem to care.  She had never thought of the\nhunchback’s being married and she was a trifle surprised.\nMrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a talkative woman\nshe continued with more interest.  This was one way\nof passing some of the time, at any rate.",
        "“She was a sweet, pretty thing and he’d have walked\nthe world over to get her a blade o’ grass she wanted.\nNobody thought she’d marry him, but she did,\nand people said she married him for his money.\nBut she didn’t–she didn’t,” positively.  “When she died–”",
        "Mary gave a little involuntary jump.",
        "“Oh! did she die!” she exclaimed, quite without meaning to.\nShe had just remembered a French fairy story she had once\nread called “Riquet a la Houppe.” It had been about a poor\nhunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her\nsuddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.",
        "“Yes, she died,” Mrs. Medlock answered.  “And it\nmade him queerer than ever.  He cares about nobody.\nHe won’t see people.  Most of the time he goes away,\nand when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in\nthe West Wing and won’t let any one but Pitcher see him.\nPitcher’s an old fellow, but he took care of him when he\nwas a child and he knows his ways.”",
        "It sounded like something in a book and it did not make\nMary feel cheerful.  A house with a hundred rooms,\nnearly all shut up and with their doors locked–a house on\nthe edge of a moor–whatsoever a moor was–sounded dreary.\nA man with a crooked back who shut himself up also! She\nstared out of the window with her lips pinched together,\nand it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun\nto pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream\ndown the window-panes. If the pretty wife had been alive\nshe might have made things cheerful by being something\nlike her own mother and by running in and out and going\nto parties as she had done in frocks “full of lace.\"\nBut she was not there any more.",
        "“You needn’t expect to see him, because ten to one you won’t,\"\nsaid Mrs. Medlock.  “And you mustn’t expect that there\nwill be people to talk to you.  You’ll have to play\nabout and look after yourself.  You’ll be told what rooms\nyou can go into and what rooms you’re to keep out of.\nThere’s gardens enough.  But when you’re in the house\ndon’t go wandering and poking about.  Mr. Craven won’t\nhave it.”",
        "“I shall not want to go poking about,” said sour little\nMary and just as suddenly as she had begun to be rather\nsorry for Mr. Archibald Craven she began to cease to be\nsorry and to think he was unpleasant enough to deserve\nall that had happened to him.",
        "And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the\nwindow of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray\nrain-storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever.\nShe watched it so long and steadily that the grayness\ngrew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell asleep.",
