        "Ponder on this—on these convictions, on these words: fix\nthine eyes on these examples, if thou wouldst be free, if thou\nhast thine heart set upon the matter according to its worth. And\nwhat marvel if thou purchase so great a thing at so great and\nhigh a price? For the sake of this that men deem liberty, some\nhang themselves, others cast themselves down from the rock; aye,\ntime has been when whole cities came utterly to an end: while for\nthe sake of the Freedom that is true, and sure, and unassailable,\ndost thou grudge to God what He gave, when He claims it? Wilt\nthou not study, as Plato saith, to endure, not death alone, but\ntorture, exile, stripes—in a word, to render up all that is not\nthine own? Else thou wilt be a slave amid slaves, wert thou ten\nthousand times a consul; aye, not a whit the less, though thou\nclimb the Palace steps. And thou shalt know how true is the\nsaying of Cleanthes, that though the words of philosophy may run\ncounter to the opinions of the world, yet have they reason on\ntheir side.",
