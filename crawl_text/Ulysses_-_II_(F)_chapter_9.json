        "–I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.",
        "He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.",
        "–Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.",
        "Tom Rochford ...",
        "–Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.",
        "Lenehan gulped to go.",
        "–Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I’m coming.",
        "He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the\nthreshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.",
        "–How do you do, Mr Dollard?",
        "–Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard’s vague bass answered, turning an\ninstant from Father Cowley’s woe. He won’t give you any trouble, Bob. Alf\nBergan will speak to the long fellow. We’ll put a barleystraw in that\nJudas Iscariot’s ear this time.",
        "Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an\neyelid.",
        "–Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a\nditty. We heard the piano.",
        "Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie.\nAnd Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now.\nHow warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let\nme see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.",
        "–What’s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.",
        "–Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.",
        "He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with\nthe: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool.\nHis gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.",
        "Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he\nwanted Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from\nafar.",
        "Jingle a tinkle jaunted.",
        "Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He’s off. Light sob of breath Bloom\nsighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He’s gone. Jingle. Hear.",
        "–Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.",
        "Miss Douce’s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind,\nsmitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting\nlight), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down\npensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar\nwhere bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast\ninexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow,\nEAU DE NIL.",
        "–Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded\nthem. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the\nCollard grand.",
        "There was.",
        "–A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn’t stop him.\nHe was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.",
        "–God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the\npunished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.",
        "They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding\ngarment.",
        "–Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where’s\nmy pipe, by the way?",
        "He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried\ntwo diners’ drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.",
        "–I saved the situation, Ben, I think.",
        "–You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. That\nwas a brilliant idea, Bob.",
        "Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the\nsitua. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.",
        "–I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in\nthe coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who\nwas it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you\nremember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in\nKeogh’s gave us the number. Remember? Ben remembered, his broad visage\nwondering.",
        "–By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.",
        "Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.",
        "–Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He\nwouldn’t take any money either. What? Any God’s quantity of cocked hats\nand boleros and trunkhose. What?",
        "–Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all\ndescriptions.",
        "Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.",
        "Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.",
        "Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice\nname he.",
        "–What’s this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion ...",
        "–Tweedy.",
        "–Yes. Is she alive?",
        "–And kicking.",
        "–She was a daughter of ...",
        "–Daughter of the regiment.",
        "–Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.",
        "Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after",
        "–Irish? I don’t know, faith. Is she, Simon?",
        "Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.",
        "–Buccinator muscle is ... What? ... Bit rusty ... O, she is ... My\nIrish Molly, O.",
        "He puffed a pungent plumy blast.",
        "–From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.",
        "They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by\nmaraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace,\nDrumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.",
        "Pat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he\nate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods’ roes while\nRichie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney,\nbite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.",
        "Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.",
        "By Bachelor’s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun\nin heat, mare’s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres:\nsprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you\nthe? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.",
        "Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding\nchords:",
        "–When Love Absorbs My Ardent Soul ...",
        "Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.",
        "–War! War! cried Father Cowley. You’re the warrior.",
        "–So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or\nmoney.",
        "He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.",
        "–Sure, you’d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said\nthrough smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.",
        "In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He\nwould.",
        "–Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time,\nBen. AMOROSO MA NON TROPPO. Let me there.",
        "Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She\npassed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather.\nThey drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going?\nAnd heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn’t say. But it would be\nin the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about her\noutspread INDEPENDENT, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of\nhair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O,\nnot in the least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze\nheard iron steel.",
        "– ............ MY ARDENT SOUL\n    I CARE NOT FOROR THE MORROW.",
        "In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War\nsomeone is. Ben Dollard’s famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a\ndress suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical\nporkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the\nbed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above,\nI’m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many!\nWell, of course that’s what gives him the base barreltone. For instance\neunuchs. Wonder who’s playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical.\nKnows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.",
        "Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George\nLidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist\n(a lady’s) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the\nold dingdong again.",
        "–Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.",
        "George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.",
        "Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the\nBurton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables,\nflowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best\nvalue in Dub.",
        "Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together,\nmutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the\nbowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore.\nNight we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus,\nbetween the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle.\nConductor’s legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide\nthem.",
        "Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.",
        "Only the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of\na lovely. Gravy’s rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that\nonce or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their\nharps. I. He. Old. Young.",
        "–Ah, I couldn’t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.",
        "Strongly.",
        "–Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.",
        "–M’APPARI, Simon, Father Cowley said.",
        "Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long\narms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he\nsang to a dusty seascape there: A LAST FAREWELL. A headland, a ship, a\nsail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the\nwind upon the headland, wind around her.",
        "Cowley sang:",
        "–M’APPARI TUTT’AMOR:\nIL MIO SGUARDO L’INCONTR ...",
        "She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to\nwind, love, speeding sail, return.",
        "–Go on, Simon.",
        "–Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben ... Well ...",
        "Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,\ntouched the obedient keys.",
        "–No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.",
        "The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.",
        "Up stage strode Father Cowley.",
        "–Here, Simon, I’ll accompany you, he said. Get up.",
        "By Graham Lemon’s pineapple rock, by Elvery’s elephant jingly\njogged. Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes\nBloom and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and\ncider.",
        "Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: SONNAMBULA. He\nheard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M’Guckin! Yes. In his way.\nChoirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like.\nNever forget it. Never.",
        "Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.\nBackache he. Bright’s bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the\npiper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile.\nSings too: DOWN AMONG THE DEAD MEN. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to\nthe. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him.\nPower. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water.\nFecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs\nand drabs. And when he’s wanted not a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay\nhis fare. Curious types.",
        "Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In\nthe gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.",
        "Speech paused on Richie’s lips.",
        "Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.",
        "Believes his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good\nmemory.",
        "–Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.",
        "–All Is Lost Now.",
        "Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured:\nall. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he’s\nproud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one\nthere. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he\ntwined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How\nsweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled.\nFall, surrender, lost.",
        "Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the\nvase. Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him.\nInnocence in the moon. Brave. Don’t know their danger. Still hold her\nback. Call name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go.\nThat’s why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.",
        "–A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.",
        "Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.",
        "He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise\nchild that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?",
        "Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking\nRichie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye.\nNow begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir.\nWouldn’t trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.",
        "Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably.\nStopped again.",
        "Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.",
        "–With it, Simon.",
        "–It, Simon.",
        "–Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind\nsolicitations.",
        "–It, Simon.",
        "–I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour\nto sing to you of a heart bowed down.",
        "By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose,\na lady’s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous EAU DE NIL Mina\nto tankards two her pinnacles of gold.",
        "The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant,\ndrew a voice away.",
        "–When First I Saw That Form Endearing ...",
        "Richie turned.",
        "–Si Dedalus’ voice, he said.",
        "Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow\nendearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to\nPat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the\nbar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting\nto hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.",
        "–Sorrow From Me Seemed to Depart.",
        "Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves\nin murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem\ndulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each\nhis remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to\nfrom both depart when first they heard. When first they saw, lost Richie\nPoldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn’t expect it in the\nleast, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.",
        "Love that is singing: love’s old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly\nthe elastic band of his packet. Love’s old sweet SONNEZ LA gold. Bloom\nwound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it\nround his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.",
        "–Full of Hope and All Delighted ...",
        "Tenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at\nhis feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He\ncan’t sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him.\nWhat perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last look\nat mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How do you?\nI do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits, in her\nsatchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.",
        "Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.",
        "–But Alas, ’twas Idle Dreaming ...",
        "Glorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly man!\nCould have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his\nwife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he doesn’t\nbreak down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing too.\nDrink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind soup:\nstock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.",
        "Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That’s the chat.\nHa, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.",
        "Words? Music? No: it’s what’s behind.",
        "Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.",
        "Bloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in\nmusic out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her\ntapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy the\nfeel the warm the. Tup. To pour o’er sluices pouring gushes. Flood, gush,\nflow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.",
        "– ... Ray of Hope Is ...",
        "Beaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse\nunsqueaked a ray of hopk.",
        "MARTHA it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel’s song. Lovely\nname you have. Can’t write. Accept my little pres. Play on her\nheartstrings pursestrings too. She’s a. I called you naughty boy. Still\nthe name: Martha. How strange! Today.",
        "The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to\nRichie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to\nwait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part,\nhow look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom’s heart.",
        "Wish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in\nDrago’s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still\nhear it better here than in the bar though farther.",
        "–Each Graceful Look ...",
        "First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon’s in Terenure. Yellow,\nblack lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her.\nFate.",
        "Round and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down she\nsat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.",
        "–Charmed My Eye ...",
        "Singing. WAITING she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume\nof what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat\nwarbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy\neyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in\nshadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.",
        "–Martha! Ah, Martha!",
        "Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant\nto love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In cry\nof lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For only her\nhe waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where. Somewhere.",
        "–CO-OME, THOU LOST ONE!\n  CO-OME, THOU DEAR ONE!",
        "Alone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!",
        "–Come!",
        "It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb\nit leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don’t spin it out too long\nlong breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, aflame,\ncrowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the etherial bosom,\nhigh, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about\nthe all, the endlessnessnessness ...",
        "–To Me!",
        "Siopold!",
        "Consumed.",
        "Come. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to\nher, you too, me, us.",
        "–Bravo! Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore!\nClapclipclap clap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore,\nenclap, said, cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George\nLidwell, Pat, Mina Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley,\nfirst gent with tank and bronze miss Douce and gold MJiss Mina.",
        "Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before.\nJingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson,\nreverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now. Atrot,\nin heat, heatseated. CLOCHE. SONNEZ LA. CLOCHE. SONNEZ LA. Slower the mare\nwent up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too slow for Boylan,\nblazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.",
        "An afterclang of Cowley’s chords closed, died on the air made richer.",
        "And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider\ndrank, Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of\ntwo more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving,\ncoral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.",
        "–Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you’d\nsing, Simon, like a garden thrush.",
        "Lionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina\nKennedy served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia,\nadmired, admired. But Bloom sang dumb.",
        "Admiring.",
        "Richie, admiring, descanted on that man’s glorious voice. He\nremembered one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang ’TWAS\nRANK AND FAME: in Ned Lambert’s ’twas. Good God he never heard in all his\nlife a note like that he never did THEN FALSE ONE WE HAD BETTER PART so\nclear so God he never heard SINCE LOVE LIVES NOT a clinking voice lives\nnot ask Lambert he can tell you too.",
        "Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the\nnight, Si in Ned Lambert’s, Dedalus house, sang ’TWAS RANK AND FAME.",
        "He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr\nBloom, of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing ’TWAS RANK AND\nFAME in his, Ned Lambert’s, house.",
        "Brothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the\nlute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more. The\nnight Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful, more\nthan all others.",
        "That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It’s in the silence after\nyou feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.",
        "Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked\nthe slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While\nGoulding talked of Barraclough’s voice production, while Tom Kernan,\nharking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening\nFather Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While\nbig Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he\nsmoked, who smoked.",
        "Thou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his\nstring. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on.\nThen tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat.\nHuman life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat’s tail wriggling! Five bob I gave.\nCORPUS PARADISUM. Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Gone.\nThey sing. Forgotten. I too; And one day she with. Leave her: get tired.\nSuffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her\nwavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:’d.",
        "Yet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not\nhappy in your? Twang. It snapped.",
        "Jingle into Dorset street.",
        "Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.",
        "–Don’t make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.",
        "George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.",
        "First gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so.\nAnd second tankard told her so. That that was so.",
        "Miss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not\nbelieve: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first: gent\nwith the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell: the\ntank.",
        "Better write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.",
        "Bald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He\nwent. A pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.",
        "–Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is.\nFew lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who is\nthis wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper,\nenvelope: unconcerned. It’s so characteristic.",
        "–Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.",

Interrogated as to whether life there\nresembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from\nmore favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped\nwith every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda,\nwataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy\nof the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was\nbrought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message\nfor the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya\nto acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that\nMars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the\nram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special\ndesires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: WE GREET YOU,\nFRIENDS OF EARTH, WHO ARE STILL IN THE BODY. MIND C. K. DOESN’T PILE IT\nON. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher,\nmanager of Messrs H. J. O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a\npersonal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying\nout of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it\nshould be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been\nlooking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that\nthe pair should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were\nstill good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in\nthe other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made\nknown.",
        "Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was\nintimated that this had given satisfaction.",
        "He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet\nwas his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with\nyour wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.",
        "–There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.",
        "–Who? says I.",
        "–Bloom, says he. He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten\nminutes.",
        "And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.",
        "Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.",
        "–Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.",
        "And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest\nblackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:",
        "–Who said Christ is good?",
        "–I beg your parsnips, says Alf.",
        "–Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy\nDignam?",
        "–Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He’s over all his troubles.",
        "But Bob Doran shouts out of him.",
        "–He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.",
        "Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they\ndidn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob\nDoran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there.",
        "–The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.",
        "The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat.\nFitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married,\nMooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street,\nthat used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that\nwas stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing\nher person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.",
        "–The noblest, the truest, says he. And he’s gone, poor little Willy, poor\nlittle Paddy Dignam.",
        "And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that\nbeam of heaven.",
        "Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing\nround the door.",
        "–Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen.",
        "So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry\nwas Martin Cunningham there.",
        "–O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this,\nwill you?",
        "And he starts reading out one.",
