        "\nReserving hexameter poetry and Comedy for consideration hereafter, let\nus proceed now to the discussion of Tragedy; before doing so, however,\nwe must gather up the definition resulting from what has been said. A\ntragedy, then, is the imitation of an action that is serious and also,\nas having magnitude, complete in itself; in language with pleasurable\naccessories, each kind brought in separately in the parts of the work;\nin a dramatic, not in a narrative form; with incidents arousing pity\nand fear, wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions. Here\nby ’language with pleasurable accessories’ I mean that with rhythm and\nharmony or song superadded; and by ’the kinds separately’ I mean that\nsome portions are worked out with verse only, and others in turn with\nsong.",
        "I. As they act the stories, it follows that in the first place the\nSpectacle (or stage-appearance of the actors) must be some part of the\nwhole; and in the second Melody and Diction, these two being the means\nof their imitation. Here by ’Diction’ I mean merely this, the\ncomposition of the verses; and by ’Melody’, what is too completely\nunderstood to require explanation. But further: the subject\nrepresented also is an action; and the action involves agents, who\nmust necessarily have their distinctive qualities both of character\nand thought, since it is from these that we ascribe certain qualities\nto their actions. There are in the natural order of things, therefore,\ntwo causes, Character and Thought, of their actions, and consequently\nof their success or failure in their lives. Now the action (that which\nwas done) is represented in the play by the Fable or Plot. The Fable,\nin our present sense of the term, is simply this, the combination of\nthe incidents, or things done in the story; whereas Character is what\nmakes us ascribe certain moral qualities to the agents; and Thought is\nshown in all they say when proving a particular point or, it may be,\nenunciating a general truth. There are six parts consequently of every\ntragedy, as a whole, that is, of such or such quality, viz. a Fable or\nPlot, Characters, Diction, Thought, Spectacle and Melody; two of them\narising from the means, one from the manner, and three from the\nobjects of the dramatic imitation; and there is nothing else besides\nthese six. Of these, its formative elements, then, not a few of the\ndramatists have made due use, as every play, one may say, admits of\nSpectacle, Character, Fable, Diction, Melody, and Thought.",
        "II. The most important of the six is the combination of the incidents\nof the story.",
        "Tragedy i.e.sentially an imitation not of persons but of action and\nlife, of happiness and misery. All human happiness or misery takes the\nform of action; the end for which we live is a certain kind of\nactivity, not a quality. Characte.g.ves us qualities, but it is in\nour actions—what we do—that we are happy or the reverse. In a play\naccordingly they do not act in order to portray the Characters; they\ninclude the Characters for the sake of the action. So that it is the\naction in it, i.e. its Fable or Plot, that is the end and purpose of\nthe tragedy; and the end i.e.erywhere the chief thing. Besides this,\na tragedy is impossible without action, but there may be one without\nCharacter. The tragedies of most of the moderns are characterless—a\ndefect common among poets of all kinds, and with its counterpart in\npainting in Zeuxis as compared with Polygnotus; for whereas the latter\nis strong in character, the work of Zeuxis is devoid of it. And again:\none may string together a series of characteristic speeches of the\nutmost finish as regards Diction and Thought, and yet fail to produce\nthe true tragi.e.fect; but one will have much better success with a\ntragedy which, however inferior in these respects, has a Plot, a\ncombination of incidents, in it. And again: the most powerful elements\nof attraction in Tragedy, the Peripeties and Discoveries, are parts of\nthe Plot. A further proof is in the fact that beginners succeed\nearlier with the Diction and Characters than with the construction of\na story; and the same may be said of nearly all the early dramatists.\nWe maintain, therefore, that the first essential, the life and soul,\nso to speak, of Tragedy is the Plot; and that the Characters come\nsecond—compare the parallel in painting, where the most beautiful\ncolours laid on without order will not give one the same pleasure as a\nsimple black-and-white sketch of a portrait. We maintain that Tragedy\nis primarily an imitation of action, and that it is mainly for the\nsake of the action that it imitates the personal agents. Third comes\nthe element of Thought, i.e. the power of saying whatever can be said,\nor what is appropriate to the occasion. This is what, in the speeches\nin Tragedy, falls under the arts of Politics and Rhetoric; for the\nolder poets make their personages discourse like statesmen, and the\nmoderns like rhetoricians. One must not confuse it with Character.\nCharacter in a play is that which reveals the moral purpose of the\nagents, i.e. the sort of thing they seek or avoid, where that is not\nobvious—hence there is no room for Character in a speech on a purely\nindifferent subject. Thought, on the other hand, is shown in all they\nsay when proving or disproving some particular point, or enunciating\nsome universal proposition. Fourth among the literary elements is the\nDiction of the personages, i.e. as before explained, the expression of\ntheir thoughts in words, which is practically the same thing with\nverse as with prose. As for the two remaining parts, the Melody is the\ngreatest of the pleasurable accessories of Tragedy. The Spectacle,\nthough an attraction, is the least artistic of all the parts, and has\nleast to do with the art of poetry. The tragi.e.fect is quite\npossible without a public performance and actors; and besides, the\ngetting-up of the Spectacle is more a matter for the costumier than\nthe poet.",
