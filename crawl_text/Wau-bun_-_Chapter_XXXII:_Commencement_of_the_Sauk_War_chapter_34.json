        "A few weeks after our return, my husband took his mother to Prairie du\nChien for the benefit of medical advice from Dr. Beaumont, of the U.S.\nArmy. The journey was made in a large open boat down the Wisconsin\nRiver, and it was proposed to take this opportunity to bring back a good\nsupply of corn for the winter’s use of both men and cattle.",
        "The ice formed in the river, however, so early, that after starting\nwith his load he was obliged to return with it to the Prairie, and wait\nuntil the thick winter’s ice enabled him to make a second journey and\nbring it up in sleighs–with so great an expense of time, labor, and\nexposure were the necessaries of life conveyed from one point to another\nthrough that wild and desolate region!",
        "The arrival of my brother Arthur from Kentucky, by way of the\nMississippi, in the latter part of April, brought us the uncomfortable\nintelligence of new troubles with the Sauks and Foxes. Black Hawk had,\nwith the flower of his nation, recrossed the Mississippi, once more to\ntake possession of their old homes and corn-fields.[52]",
        "It was not long before our own Indians came flocking in, to confirm the\ntidings, and to assure us of their intention to remain faithful friends\nto the Americans. We soon heard of the arrival of the Illinois Rangers\nin the Rock River country, also of the progress of the regular force\nunder General Atkinson, in pursuit of the hostile Indians, who, by the\nreports, were always able to elude their vigilance. It not being their\ncustom to stop and give battle, the Sauks soon scattered themselves\nthrough the country, trusting to some lucky accident (and such arrived,\nalas! only too often) to enable them to fall upon their enemies\nunexpectedly.",
        "The experience of the pursuing army was, for the most part, to make\ntheir way, by toilsome and fatiguing marches, to the spot where they\nimagined the Sauks would be waiting to receive them, and then to\ndiscover that the rogues had scampered off to quite a different part of\nthe country.",
        "Wherever these latter went, their course was marked by the most\natrocious barbarities, though the worst had not, at this time, reached\nour ears. We were only assured that they were down in the neighborhood\nof the Rock River and Kishwaukee, and that they lost no opportunity of\nfalling upon the defenceless inhabitants and cruelly murdering them.",
        "As soon as it became certain that the Sauks and Foxes would not pursue\nthe same course they had on the previous year, that is, retreat\npeaceably across the Mississippi, Mr. Kinzie resolved to hold a council\nwith all the principal chiefs of the Winnebagoes who were accessible at\nthis time. He knew that the Sauks would use every effort to induce their\nneighbors to join them, and that there existed in the breasts of too\nmany of the young savages a desire to distinguish themselves by “taking\nsome white scalps.” They did not love the Americans–why should they? By\nthem they had been gradually dispossessed of the broad and beautiful\ndomains of their forefathers, and hunted from place to place, and the\nonly equivalent they had received in exchange had been a few thousands\nannually in silver and presents, together with the pernicious example,\nthe debasing influence, and the positive ill treatment of too many of\nthe new settlers upon their lands.",
        "With all these facts in view, therefore, their Father felt that the\nutmost watchfulness was necessary, and that the strongest arguments must\nbe brought forward, to preserve the young men of the Winnebagoes in\ntheir allegiance to the Americans. Of the older members he felt quite\nsure. About fifty lodges had come at the commencement of the\ndisturbances and encamped around our dwelling, saying that if the Sauks\nattacked us it must be after killing them; and, knowing them well, we\nhad perfect confidence in their assurances.",
        "But their vicinity, while it gave us a feeling of protection, likewise\nfurnished us with a channel of the most exciting and agitating daily\ncommunications. As the theatre of operations approached nearer and\nnearer, intelligence was brought in by their runners–now, that “Captain\nBarney’s head had been recognized in the Sauk camp, where it had been\nbrought the day previous,” next, that “the Sauks were carrying\nLieutenant Beall’s head on a pole in front of them as they marched to\nmeet the whites.” Sometimes it was a story which we afterwards found to\nbe unhappily true, as that of the murder of their Agent, M. St Vrain, at\nKellogg’s Grove, by the Sauks themselves, who ought to have protected\nhim.",
        "It was after the news of this last occurrence that the appointed council\nwith the Winnebagoes was to be held at the Four Lakes, thirty-five miles\ndistant from Fort Winnebago.",
        "In vain we pleaded and remonstrated against such an exposure. “It was\nhis duty to assemble his people and talk to them,” my husband said, “and\nhe must run the risk, if there were any. He had perfect confidence in\nthe Winnebagoes. The enemy, by all he could learn, were now far distant\nfrom the Four Lakes–probably at Kosh-ko-nong. He would set off early in\nthe morning with Paquette, bold his council, and return to us the same\nevening.”",
        "It were useless to attempt to describe our feelings during that long and\ndreary day. When night arrived, the cry of a drunken Indian, or even the\nbarking of a dog, would fill our hearts with terror.",
        "As we sat, at a late hour, at the open window, listening to every sound,\nwith what joy did we at length distinguish the tramp of horses! We knew\nit to be Griffin and Jerry ascending the hill, and a cheerful shout soon\nannounced that all was well. My husband and his interpreter had ridden\nseventy miles that day, besides holding a long “talk” with the Indians.",
        "The Winnebagoes in council had promised to use their utmost endeavors to\npreserve peace and good order among their young men. They informed their\nFather that the bands on the Rock River, with the exception of\nWin-no-sheek’s, were all determined to remain friendly and keep aloof\nfrom the Sauks. To that end, they were abandoning their villages and\ncorn-fields and moving north, that their Great Father, the President,\nmight not feel dissatisfied with them. With regard to Win-no-sheek and\nhis people, they professed themselves unable to answer.",
        "Time went on, and brought with it stories of fresh outrages. Among these\nwere the murders of Auberry, Green, and Force, at Blue Mound, and the\nattack on Apple Fort. The tidings of the latter were brought by old\nCrély,[53] the father of Mrs. Paquette, who rode express from Galena,\nand who averred that he once passed a bush behind which the Sauks were\nhiding, but that his horse smelt the sweet-scented grass with which they\nalways adorn their persons when on a war-party, and set out on such a\ngallop that he never stopped until he arrived at the Portage.",
        "Another bearer of news was a young gentleman named Follett, whose eyes\nhad become so protruded and set from keeping an anxious look-out for the\nenemy, that it was many days after his arrival at a place of safety\nbefore they resumed their accustomed limits and expression.",
        "Among other rumors which at this time reached us, was one that an attack\nupon Fort Winnebago was in contemplation among the Sauks. That this was\nin no state of defence the Indians very well knew. All the effective\nmen had been withdrawn, upon a requisition from General Atkinson, to\njoin him at his newly-built fort at Kosh-ko-nong.",
        "Fort Winnebago was not picketed in; there were no defences to the\nbarracks or officers’ quarters, except slight panelled doors and\nVenetian blinds–nothing that would long resist the blows of clubs or\nhatchets. There was no artillery, and the Commissary’s store was without\nthe bounds of the Fort, under the hill.",
        "Mr. Kinzie had, from the first, called the attention of the officers to\nthe insecurity of their position in case of danger, but he generally\nreceived a scoffing answer.",
        "“Never fear,” they would say; “the Sauks are not coming here to attack\nus.”",
        "One afternoon we were over on a visit to some ladies in the garrison,\nand, several officers being present, the conversation, as usual, turned\nupon the present position of affairs.",
        "“Do you not think it wiser,” inquired I of a blustering young officer,\n“to be prepared against possible danger?”",
        "“Not against these fellows,” replied he, contemptuously.",
        "“I do not think I would even take the trouble to fasten the blinds to my\nquarters.”",
        "“At least,” said I, “if you some night find a tomahawk raised to cleave\nyour skull, you will have the consolation of remembering that you have\nnot been one of those foolish fellows who keep on the safe side.”",
        "He seemed a little nettled at this, and still more so when sister\nMargaret observed,–",
        "“For my part, I am of Governor Cass’s opinion. He was at Chicago during\nthe Winnebago war. We were all preparing to move into the fort on the\nfirst alarm. Some were for being brave and delaying, like our friends\nhere. ’Come, come,’ said the Governor, ’hurry into the fort as fast as\npossible–there is no merit in being brave with the Indians. It is the\nheight of folly to stay and meet danger which you may by prudence\navoid.’”",
        "In a few days our friends waked up to the conviction that something must\nbe done at once The first step was to forbid any Winnebago coming within\nthe garrison, lest they should find out what they had known as well as\nourselves for three months past–namely, the feebleness of the means of\nresistance. The next was to send fatigue-parties into the woods, under\nthe protection of a guard, to cut pickets for inclosing the garrison.",
        "There was every reason to believe that the enemy were not very far\ndistant, and that their object in coming north was to break a way into\nthe Chippewa country, where they would find a place of security among\ntheir friends and allies. The story that our Indian runners brought in\nmost frequently was, that the Sauks were determined to fall upon the\nwhites at the Portage and Fort, and massacre all, except the families of\nthe Agent and Interpreter.",
        "Plante and Pillon with their families had departed at the first word of\ndanger. There only remained with us Manaigre, whose wife was a\nhalf-Winnebago, Isidore Morrin, and the blacksmiths from Sugar\nCreek–Mâtâ and Turcotte.",
        "At night we were all regularly armed and our posts assigned us. After\nevery means had been taken to make the house secure, the orders were\ngiven. Sister Margaret and I, in case of attack, were to mount with the\nchildren to the rooms above, while my husband and his men were to make\ngood their defence as long as possible against the enemy. Since I had\nshown my sportsmanship by bringing down accidentally a blackbird on the\nwing, I felt as if I could do some execution with my little pistols,\nwhich were regularly placed beside my pillow at night; and I was fully\nresolved to use them, if necessity required. I do not remember to have\nfelt the slightest compunction at the idea of taking the lives of two\nSauks, as I had no doubt I should do; and this explains to me what I had\nbefore often wondered at, the indifference, namely, of the soldier on\nthe field of battle to the destruction of human life Had I been called\nupon, however, to use my weapons effectually, I should no doubt have\nlooked back upon it with horror.",
        "Surrounded as we were by Indian lodges, which seldom became perfectly\nquiet, and excited as our nerves had become by all that we were daily in\nthe habit of hearing, we rarely slept very soundly. One night, after we\nhad as much as possible composed ourselves, we were startled at a late\nhour by a tap upon the window at the head of our bed, and a call of\n“Chon! Chon!\"[54] (John! John!)",
        "“Tshah-ko-zhah?” (What is it?)",
        "It was Hoo-wau-ne-kah, the Little Elk. He spoke rapidly, and in a tone\nof great agitation. I could not understand him, and I lay trembling, and\ndreading to hear his errand interpreted. Now and then I could\ndistinguish the words Sau-kee (Sauks) and Shoonk-hat-tay-rah (horse),\nand they were not very reassuring.",
        "The trouble, I soon learned, was this. A fresh trail had been observed\nnear the Petit Rocher, on the Wisconsin, and the people at the villages\non the Barribault were in a state of great alarm, fearing it might be\nthe Sauks. There was the appearance of a hundred or more horses having\npassed by this trail. Hoo-wau-ne-kah had been dispatched at once to\ntell their Father, and to ask his advice.",
        "After listening to all he had to communicate, his Father told him the\ntrail was undoubtedly that of General Henry’s troops, who were said to\nhave come north, looking for the enemy; that as the marks of the horses’\nhoofs showed them, by this report, to have been shod, that was\nsufficient proof that it was not the trail of the Sauks. He thought that\nthe people at the villages need not feel any uneasiness.",
        "“Very well, Father,” replied Hoo-wau-ne-kah; “I will go back and tell my\npeople what you say. They will believe you, for you always tell them the\ntruth. You are not like us Indians, who sometimes deceive each other.\"\nSo saying, he returned to his friends, much comforted.",
        "The completion of the picketing and other defences, together with the\narrival of a detachment of troops from Fort Howard under Lieutenant\nHunter, at our fort, now seemed to render the latter the place of\ngreatest safety. We therefore regularly, every evening immediately\nbefore dusk, took up our line of march for the opposite side of the\nriver, and repaired to quarters that had been assigned us within the\ngarrison, leaving our own house and chattels to the care of the\nFrenchmen and our friends the Winnebagoes.",
        "It was on one of these days that we were sitting at the windows which\nlooked out over the Portage–indeed, we seldom sat anywhere else, our\nalmost sole occupation being to look abroad and see what was coming\nnext–when a loud, long, shrill whoop from a distance gave notice of\nsomething to be heard. “The news-halloo! what could it portend? What\nwere we about to hear?” By gazing intently towards the farthest\nextremity of the road, we could perceive a moving body of horsemen,\nwhich, as they approached, we saw to be Indians. They were in full\ncostume. Scarlet streamers fluttered at the ends of their lances–their\narms glittered in the sun. Presently, as they drew nearer, their paint\nand feathers and brooches became visible. There were fifty or more\nwarriors. They passed the road which turns to the Fort, and rode\ndirectly up the hill leading to the Agency. Shaw-nee-aw-kee was absent.\nThe Interpreter had been sent for on the first distant appearance of the\nstrangers, but had not yet arrived. The party, having ascended the hill,\nhalted near the blacksmith’s shop, but did not dismount.",
        "Our hearts trembled–it must surely be the enemy. At this moment my\nhusband appeared from the direction of the Interpreter’s house. We\ncalled to entreat him to stop, but he walked along towards the\nnew-comers.",
        "To our infinite joy, we saw the chief of the party dismount, and all the\nothers following his example and approaching to shake hands.",
        "A space was soon cleared around the leader and my husband, when the\nformer commenced an oration, flourishing his sword and using much\nviolent gesticulation. It was the first time I had seen an Indian armed\nwith that weapon, and I dreaded to perceive it in such hands. Sometimes\nhe appeared as if he were about to take off the head of his auditor at a\nblow; and our hearts sank as we remembered the stratagems at Mackinac\nand Detroit in former days. At length the speech was concluded, another\nshaking of hands took place, and we saw my husband leading the way to\nhis storehouse, from which some of his men presently brought tobacco and\npipes and laid them at the feet of the chief.",
        "Our suspense was soon relieved by being informed that the strangers were\nMan-Eater, the principal chief of the Rock River Indians, who had come\nwith his band to “hold a talk” and bring information.",
        "These Indians were under the special care of Mr. Henry Gratiot, and his\nefforts had been most judicious and unremitting in preserving the good\nfeeling of this the most dangerous portion of the Winnebagoes.",
        "The intelligence that Man-Eater, who was a most noble Indian in\nappearance and character, brought us, confirmed that already received,\nnamely, that the Sauks were gradually drawing north, towards the\nPortage, although he evidently did not know exactly their whereabouts.",
        "There was, soon after they had taken leave, an arrival of another party\nof Winnebagoes, and these requested permission to dance for their\nFather.",
        "The compliment having been accepted, they assembled, as usual, on the\nesplanade in front of the house. My sister, the children, and myself\nstationed ourselves at the open windows, according to custom, and my\nhusband sat on the broad step before the door, which opened from the\nouter air directly into the parlor where we were.",
        "The performance commenced, and as the dancers proceeded, following each\nother round and round in the progress of the dance, my sister, Mrs.\nHelm, remarked to me, “Look at that small, dark Indian, with the green\nboughs on his person–that is a Sauk! They always mark themselves in\nthis manner with white clay, and ornament themselves with leaves when\nthey dance!” In truth, I had never seen this costume among our own\nIndians, and as I gazed at this one with green chaplets round his head\nand his legs, and even his gun wreathed in the same manner, while his\nbody displayed no paint except the white transverse streaks with which\nit was covered, I saw that he was, indeed, a stranger. Without owing\nanything to the exaggeration of fear, his countenance was truly\nferocious.",
        "He held his gun in his hand, and every time the course of the dance\nbrought him directly in front of where we sat, he would turn his gaze\nfull upon us, and club his weapon before him with what we interpreted\ninto an air of defiance. We sat as still as death, for we knew it would\nnot be wise to exhibit any appearance of fear; but my sister remarked,\nin a low tone, “I have always thought that I was to lose my life by the\nhands of the Indians. This is the third Indian war I have gone through,\nand now, I suppose, it will be the last.”",
        "It was the only time I ever saw her lose her self-possession. She was\nalways remarkably calm and resolute, but now I could see that she\ntrembled. Still we sat there–there was a sort of fascination as our\nimaginations became more and more excited. Presently some rain-drops\nbegan to fall. The Indians continued their dance for a few minutes\nlonger, then, with whoopings and shoutings, they rushed simultaneously\ntowards the house. We fled into my apartment and closed the door, which\nmy sister at first held fast, but she presently came and seated herself\nby me on the bed, for she saw that I could not compose myself. Of all\nforms of death, that by the hands of savages is the most difficult to\nface calmly; and I fully believed that our hour was come.",
        "There was no interruption to the dance, which the Indians carried on in\nthe parlor, leaping and yelling as if they would bring down the roof\nover our heads. In vain we tried to persuade my husband and the\nchildren, through a crevice of the door, to come and join us. The\nlatter, feeling no danger, were too much delighted with the exhibition\nto leave it, and the former only came for a moment to reassure me, and\nthen judged it wisest to return, and manifest his satisfaction at the\ncompliment by his presence. He made light of our fears, and would not\nadmit that the object of our suspicions was in fact a Sauk, but only\nsome young Winnebago, who had, as is sometimes the custom, imitated them\nin costume and appearance.",
        "It may have been “good fun” to him to return to his village and tell how\nhe frightened “the white squaws.” Such a trick would not be unnatural in\na white youth, and perhaps, since human nature is everywhere the same,\nit might not be out of the way in an Indian.",
