        "\n\n",
        "The English-speaking world long ago accepted a conventional view\nof Marie Antoinette. The eloquence of Edmund Burke in one\nbrilliant passage has fixed, probably for all time, an enduring\npicture of this unhappy queen.",
        "When we speak or think of her we speak and think first of all of a\ndazzling and beautiful woman surrounded by the chivalry of France\nand gleaming like a star in the most splendid court of Europe. And\nthen there comes to us the reverse of the picture. We see her\ndespised, insulted, and made the butt of brutal men and still more\nfiendish women; until at last the hideous tumbrel conveys her to\nthe guillotine, where her head is severed from her body and her\ncorpse is cast down into a bloody pool.",
        "In these two pictures our emotions are played upon in turn–\nadmiration, reverence, devotion, and then pity, indignation, and\nthe shudderings of horror.",
        "Probably in our own country and in England this will remain the\nhistoric Marie Antoinette. Whatever the impartial historian may\nwrite, he can never induce the people at large to understand that\nthis queen was far from queenly, that the popular idea of her is\nalmost wholly false, and that both in her domestic life and as the\ngreatest lady in France she did much to bring on the terrors of\nthat revolution which swept her to the guillotine.",
        "In the first place, it is mere fiction that represents Maria\nAntoinette as having been physically beautiful. The painters and\nengravers have so idealized her face as in most cases to have\nproduced a purely imaginary portrait.",
        "She was born in Vienna, in 1755, the daughter of the Emperor\nFrancis and of that warrior-queen, Maria Theresa. She was a very\nGerman-looking child. Lady Jackson describes her as having a\nlong, thin face, small, pig-like eyes, a pinched-up mouth, with\nthe heavy Hapsburg lip, and with a somewhat misshapen form, so\nthat for years she had to be bandaged tightly to give her a more\nnatural figure.",
        "At fourteen, when she was betrothed to the heir to the French\nthrone, she was a dumpy, mean-looking little creature, with no\ndistinction whatever, and with only her bright golden hair to make\namends for her many blemishes. At fifteen she was married and\njoined the Dauphin in French territory.",
        "We must recall for a moment the conditions which prevailed in\nFrance. King Louis XV. was nearing his end. He was a man of the\nmost shameless life; yet he had concealed or gilded his infamies\nby an external dignity and magnificence which, were very pleasing\nto his people. The French, liked to think that their king was the\nmost splendid monarch and the greatest gentleman in Europe. The\ncourtiers about him might be vile beneath the surface, yet they\nwere compelled to deport themselves with the form and the\netiquette that had become traditional in France. They might be\npanders, or stock-jobbers, or sellers of political offices; yet\nthey must none the less have wit and grace and outward nobility of\nmanner.",
        "There was also a tradition regarding the French queen. However\nloose in character the other women of the court might be, she\nalone, like Caesar’s wife, must remain above suspicion. She must\nbe purer than the pure. No breath, of scandal must reach her or be\ndirected against her.",
        "In this way the French court, even under so dissolute a monarch as\nLouis XV., maintained its hold upon the loyalty of the people.\nCrowds came every morning to view the king in his bed before he\narose; the same crowds watched him as he was dressed by the\ngentlemen of the bedchamber, and as he breakfasted and went\nthrough all the functions which are usually private. The King of\nFrance must be a great actor. He must appear to his people as in\nreality a king-stately, dignified, and beyond all other human\nbeings in his remarkable presence.",
        "When the Dauphin and Marie Antoinette came to the French court\nKing Louis XV. kept up in the case the same semblance of\nausterity. He forbade these children to have their sleeping-\napartments together. He tried to teach them that if they were to\ngovern as well as to reign they must conform to the rigid\netiquette of Paris and Versailles.",
        "It proved a difficult task, however. The little German princess\nhad no natural dignity, though she came from a court where the\nvery strictest imperial discipline prevailed. Marie Antoinette\nfound that she could have her own way in many things, and she\nchose to enjoy life without regard to ceremony. Her escapades at\nfirst would have been thought mild enough had she not been a\n“daughter of France\"; but they served to shock the old French\nking, and likewise, perhaps even more, her own imperial mother,\nMaria Theresa.",
        "When a report of the young girl’s conduct was brought to her the\nempress was at first mute with indignation. Then she cried out:",
        "“Can this girl be a child of mine? She surely must be a\nchangeling!”",
        "The Austrian ambassador to France was instructed to warn the\nDauphiness to be more discreet.",
        "“Tell her,” said Maria Theresa, “that she will lose her throne,\nand even her life, unless she shows more prudence.”",
        "But advice and remonstrance were of no avail. Perhaps they might\nhave been had her husband possessed a stronger character; but the\nyoung Louis was little more fitted to be a king than was his wife\nto be a queen. Dull of perception and indifferent to affairs of\nstate, he had only two interests that absorbed him. One was the\nlove of hunting, and the other was his desire to shut himself up\nin a sort of blacksmith shop, where he could hammer away at the\nanvil, blow the bellows, and manufacture small trifles of\nmechanical inventions. From this smudgy den he would emerge, sooty\nand greasy, an object of distaste to his frivolous princess, with\nher foamy laces and perfumes and pervasive daintiness.",
        "It was hinted in many quarters, and it has been many times\nrepeated, that Louis was lacking in virility. Certainly he had no\ninterest in the society of women and was wholly continent. But\nthis charge of physical incapacity seems to have had no real\nfoundation. It had been made against some of his predecessors. It\nwas afterward hurled at Napoleon the Great, and also Napoleon the\nLittle. In France, unless a royal personage was openly licentious,\nhe was almost sure to be jeered at by the people as a weakling.",
        "And so poor Louis XVI., as he came to be, was treated with a\nmixture of pity and contempt because he loved to hammer and mend\nlocks in his smithy or shoot game when he might have been\ncaressing ladies who would have been proud to have him choose them\nout.",
        "On the other hand, because of this opinion regarding Louis, people\nwere the more suspicious of Marie Antoinette. Some of them, in\ncoarse language, criticized her assumed infidelities; others, with\na polite sneer, affected to defend her. But the result of it all\nwas dangerous to both, especially as France was already verging\ntoward the deluge which Louis XV. had cynically predicted would\nfollow after him.",
        "In fact, the end came sooner than any one had guessed. Louis XV.,\nwho had become hopelessly and helplessly infatuated with the low-\nborn Jeanne du Barry, was stricken down with smallpox of the most\nvirulent type. For many days he lay in his gorgeous bed. Courtiers\ncrowded his sick-room and the adjacent hall, longing for the\nmoment when the breath would leave his body. He had lived an evil\nlife, and he was to die a loathsome death; yet he had borne\nhimself before men as a stately monarch. Though his people had\nsuffered in a thousand ways from his misgovernment, he was still\nLouis the Well Beloved, and they blamed his ministers of state for\nall the shocking wrongs that France had felt.",
        "The abler men, and some of the leaders of the people, however,\nlooked forward to the accession of Louis XVI. He at least was\nfrugal in his habits and almost plebeian in his tastes, and seemed\nto be one who would reduce the enormous taxes that had been levied\nupon France.",
        "The moment came when the Well Beloved died. His death-room was\nfetid with disease, and even the long corridors of the palace\nreeked with infection, while the motley mob of men and women, clad\nin silks and satins and glittering with jewels, hurried from the\nspot to pay their homage to the new Louis, who was spoken of as\n“the Desired.” The body of the late monarch was hastily thrown\ninto a mass of quick-lime, and was driven away in a humble wagon,\nwithout guards and with no salute, save from a single veteran, who\nremembered the glories of Fontenoy and discharged his musket as\nthe royal corpse was carried through the palace gates.",
        "This was a critical moment in the history of France; but we have\nto consider it only as a critical moment in the history of Marie\nAntoinette. She was now queen. She had it in her power to restore\nto the French court its old-time grandeur, and, so far as the\nqueen was concerned, its purity. Above all, being a foreigner, she\nshould have kept herself free from reproach and above every shadow\nof suspicion.",
        "But here again the indifference of the king undoubtedly played a\nstrange part in her life. Had he borne himself as her lord and\nmaster she might have respected him. Had he shown her the\naffection of a husband she might have loved him. But he was\nneither imposing, nor, on the other hand, was he alluring. She\nwrote very frankly about him in a letter to the Count Orsini:",
        "My tastes are not the same as those of the king, who cares only\nfor hunting and blacksmith work. You will admit that I should not\nshow to advantage in a forge. I could not appear there as Vulcan,\nand the part of Venus might displease him even more than my\ntastes.",
        "Thus on the one side is a woman in the first bloom of youth,\nardent, eager–and neglected. On the other side is her husband,\nwhose sluggishness may be judged by quoting from a diary which he\nkept during the month in which he was married. Here is a part of\nit:",
        "Sunday, 13–Left Versailles. Supper and slept at Compignee, at the\nhouse of M. de Saint-Florentin.",
        "Monday, 14–Interview with Mme. la Dauphine.",
        "Tuesday, 15–Supped at La Muette. Slept at Versailles.",
        "Wednesday, 16–My marriage. Apartment in the gallery. Royal\nbanquet in the Salle d’Opera.",
        "Thursday, 17–Opera of “Perseus.”",
        "Friday, 18–Stag-hunt. Met at La Belle Image. Took one.",
        "Saturday, 19–Dress-ball in the Salle d’Opera. Fireworks.",
        "Thursday, 31–I had an indigestion.",
        "What might have been expected from a young girl placed as this\nqueen was placed? She was indeed an earlier Eugenie. The first was\nof royal blood, the second was almost a plebeian; but each was\nheadstrong, pleasure-loving, and with no real domestic ties. As\nMr. Kipling expresses it–",
        "and so the Austrian woman of 1776 and the Spanish woman of 1856\nfound amusement in very similar ways. They plunged into a sea of\nstrange frivolity, such as one finds to-day at the centers of high\nfashion. Marie Antoinette bedecked herself with eccentric\ngarments. On her head she wore a hat styled a “what-is-it,\"\ntowering many feet in height and flaunting parti-colored plumes.\nWorse than all this, she refused to wear corsets, and at some\ngreat functions she would appear in what looked exactly like a\nbedroom gown.",
        "She would even neglect the ordinary niceties of life. Her hands\nwere not well cared for. It was very difficult for the ladies in\nattendance to persuade her to brush her teeth with regularity.\nAgain, she would persist in wearing her frilled and lace-trimmed\npetticoats long after their dainty edges had been smirched and\nblackened.",
        "Yet these things might have been counteracted had she gone no\nfurther. Unfortunately, she did go further. She loved to dress at\nnight like a shop-girl and venture out into the world of Paris,\nwhere she was frequently followed and recognized. Think of it–the\nQueen of France, elbowed in dense crowds and seeking to attract\nthe attention of common soldiers!",
        "Of course, almost every one put the worst construction upon this,\nand after a time upon everything she did. When she took a fancy\nfor constructing labyrinths and secret passages in the palace, all\nParis vowed that she was planning means by which her various\nlovers might enter without observation. The hidden printing-\npresses of Paris swarmed with gross lampoons about this reckless\ngirl; and, although there was little truth in what they said,\nthere was enough to cloud her reputation. When she fell ill with\nthe measles she was attended in her sick-chamber by four gentlemen\nof the court. The king was forbidden to enter lest he might catch\nthe childish disorder.",
        "The apathy of the king, indeed, drove her into many a folly. After\nfour years of marriage, as Mrs. Mayne records, he had only reached\nthe point of giving her a chilly kiss. The fact that she had no\nchildren became a serious matter. Her brother, the Emperor Joseph\nof Austria, when he visited Paris, ventured to speak to the king\nupon the subject. Even the Austrian ambassador had thrown out\nhints that the house of Bourbon needed direct heirs. Louis grunted\nand said little, but he must have known how good was the advice.",
        "It was at about this time when there came to the French court a\nyoung Swede named Axel de Fersen, who bore the title of count, but\nwho was received less for his rank than for his winning manner,\nhis knightly bearing, and his handsome, sympathetic face. Romantic\nin spirit, he threw himself at once into a silent inner worship of\nMarie Antoinette, who had for him a singular attraction. Wherever\nhe could meet her they met. To her growing cynicism this breath of\npure yet ardent affection was very grateful. It came as something\nfresh and sweet into the feverish life she led.",
        "Other men had had the audacity to woo her–among them Duc de\nLauzun, whose complicity in the famous affair of the diamond\nnecklace afterward cast her, though innocent, into ruin; the Duc\nde Biron; and the Baron de Besenval, who had obtained much\ninfluence over her, which he used for the most evil purposes.\nBesenval tainted her mind by persuading her to read indecent\nbooks, in the hope that at last she would become his prey.",
        "But none of these men ever meant to Marie Antoinette what Fersen\nmeant. Though less than twenty years of age, he maintained the\nreserve of a great gentleman, and never forced himself upon her\nnotice. Yet their first acquaintance had occurred in such a way as\nto give to it a touch of intimacy. He had gone to a masked ball,\nand there had chosen for his partner a lady whose face was quite\nconcealed. Something drew the two together. The gaiety of the\nwoman and the chivalry of the man blended most harmoniously. It\nwas only afterward that he discovered that his chance partner was\nthe first lady in France. She kept his memory in her mind; for\nsome time later, when he was at a royal drawing-room and she heard\nhis voice, she exclaimed:",
        "“Ah, an old acquaintance!”",
        "From this time Fersen was among those who were most intimately\nfavored by the queen. He had the privilege of attending her\nprivate receptions at the palace of the Trianon, and was a\nconspicuous figure at the feasts given in the queen’s honor by the\nPrincess de Lamballe, a beautiful girl whose head was destined\nafterward to be severed from her body and borne upon a bloody pike\nthrough the streets of Paris. But as yet the deluge had not\narrived and the great and noble still danced upon the brink of a\nvolcano.",
        "Fersen grew more and more infatuated, nor could he quite conceal\nhis feelings. The queen, in her turn, was neither frightened nor\nindignant. His passion, so profound and yet so respectful, deeply\nmoved her. Then came a time when the truth was made clear to both\nof them. Fersen was near her while she was singing to the\nharpsichord, and “she was betrayed by her own music into an avowal\nwhich song made easy.” She forgot that she was Queen of France.\nShe only felt that her womanhood had been starved and slighted,\nand that here was a noble-minded lover of whom she could be proud.",
        "Some time after this announcement was officially made of the\napproaching accouchement of the queen. It was impossible that\nmalicious tongues should be silent. The king’s brother, the Comte\nde Provence, who hated the queen, just as the Bonapartes afterward\nhated Josephine, did his best to besmirch her reputation. He had,\nindeed, the extraordinary insolence to do so at a time when one\nwould suppose that the vilest of men would remain silent. The\nchild proved to be a princess, and she afterward received the\ntitle of Duchesse d’Angouleme. The King of Spain asked to be her\ngodfather at the christening, which was to be held in the\ncathedral of Notre Dame. The Spanish king was not present in\nperson, but asked the Comte de Provence to act as his proxy.",
        "On the appointed day the royal party proceeded to the cathedral,\nand the Comte de Provence presented the little child at the\nbaptismal font. The grand almoner, who presided, asked;",
        "“What name shall be given to this child?”",
        "The Comte de Provence answered in a sneering tone:",
        "“Oh, we don’t begin with that. The first thing to find out is who\nthe father and the mother are!”",
        "These words, spoken at such a place and such a time, and with a\nstrongly sardonic ring, set all Paris gossiping. It was a thinly\nveiled innuendo that the father of the child was not the King of\nFrance. Those about the court immediately began to look at Fersen\nwith significant smiles. The queen would gladly have kept him near\nher; but Fersen cared even more for her good name than for his\nlove of her. It would have been so easy to remain in the full\nenjoyment of his conquest; but he was too chivalrous for that, or,\nrather, he knew that the various ambassadors in Paris had told\ntheir respective governments of the rising scandal. In fact, the\nfollowing secret despatch was sent to the King of Sweden by his\nenvoy:",
        "I must confide to your majesty that the young Count Fersen has\nbeen so well received by the queen that various persons have taken\nit amiss. I own that I am sure that she has a liking for him. I\nhave seen proofs of it too certain to be doubted. During the last\nfew days the queen has not taken her eyes off him, and as she\ngazed they were full of tears. I beg your majesty to keep their\nsecret to yourself.",
        "The queen wept because Fersen had resolved to leave her lest she\nshould be exposed to further gossip. If he left her without any\napparent reason, the gossip would only be the more intense.\nTherefore he decided to join the French troops who were going to\nAmerica to fight under Lafayette. A brilliant but dissolute\nduchess taunted him when the news became known.",
        "“How is this?” said she. “Do you forsake your conquest?”",
        "But, “lying like a gentleman,” Fersen answered, quietly:",
        "“Had I made a conquest I should not forsake it. I go away free,\nand, unfortunately, without leaving any regret.”",
        "Nothing could have been more chivalrous than the pains which\nFersen took to shield the reputation of the queen. He even allowed\nit to be supposed that he was planning a marriage with a rich\nyoung Swedish woman who had been naturalized in England. As a\nmatter of fact, he departed for America, and not very long\nafterward the young woman in question married an Englishman.",
        "Fersen served in America for a time, returning, however, at the\nend of three years. He was one of the original Cincinnati, being\nadmitted to the order by Washington himself. When he returned to\nFrance he was received with high honors and was made colonel of\nthe royal Swedish regiment.",
        "The dangers threatening Louis and his court, which were now\ngigantic and appalling, forbade him to forsake the queen. By her\nside he did what he could to check the revolution; and, failing\nthis, he helped her to maintain an imperial dignity of manner\nwhich she might otherwise have lacked. He faced the bellowing mob\nwhich surrounded the Tuileries. Lafayette tried to make the\nNational Guard obey his orders, but he was jeered at for his\npains. Violent epithets were hurled at the king. The least\ninsulting name which they could give him was “a fat pig.” As for\nthe queen, the most filthy phrases were showered upon her by the\nmen, and even more so by the women, who swarmed out of the slums\nand sought her life.",
        "At last, in 1791, it was decided that the king and the queen and\ntheir children, of whom they now had three, should endeavor to\nescape from Paris. Fersen planned their flight, but it proved to\nbe a failure. Every one remembers how they were discovered and\nhalted at Varennes. The royal party was escorted back to Paris by\nthe mob, which chanted with insolent additions:",
        "“We’ve brought back the baker, the baker’s wife, and the baker’s\nboy! Now we shall have bread!”",
        "Against the savage fury which soon animated the French a foreigner\nlike Fersen could do very little; but he seems to have endeavored,\nnight and day, to serve the woman whom he loved. His efforts have\nbeen described by Grandat; but they were of no avail. The king and\nqueen were practically made prisoners. Their eldest son died. They\nwent through horrors that were stimulated by the wretch Hebert, at\nthe head of his so-called Madmen (Enrages). The king was executed\nin January, 1792. The queen dragged out a brief existence in a\nprison where she was for ever under the eyes of human brutes, who\nguarded her and watched her and jeered at her at times when even\nmen would be sensitive. Then, at last, she mounted the scaffold,\nand her head, with its shining hair, fell into the bloody basket.",
        "Marie Antoinette shows many contradictions in her character. As a\nyoung girl she was petulant and silly and almost unseemly in her\nactions. As a queen, with waning power, she took on a dignity\nwhich recalled the dignity of her imperial mother. At first a\nflirt, she fell deeply in love when she met a man who was worthy\nof that love. She lived for most part like a mere cocotte. She\ndied every inch a queen.",
        "One finds a curious resemblance between the fate of Marie\nAntoinette and that of her gallant lover, who outlived her for\nnearly twenty years. She died amid the shrieks and execrations of\na maddened populace in Paris; he was practically torn in pieces by\na mob in the streets of Stockholm. The day of his death was the\nanniversary of the flight to Varennes. To the last moment of his\nexistence he remained faithful to the memory of the royal woman\nwho had given herself so utterly to him.",
