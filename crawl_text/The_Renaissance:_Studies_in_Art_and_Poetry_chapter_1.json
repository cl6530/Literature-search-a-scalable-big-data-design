        "[vii] Many attempts have been made by writers on art and poetry to\ndefine beauty in the abstract, to express it in the most general\nterms, to find some universal formula for it.  The value of these\nattempts has most often been in the suggestive and penetrating\nthings said by the way.  Such discussions help us very little to\nenjoy what has been well done in art or poetry, to discriminate\nbetween what is more and what is less excellent in them, or to use\nwords like beauty, excellence, art, poetry, with a more precise\nmeaning than they would otherwise have.  Beauty, like all other\nqualities presented to human experience, is relative; and the\ndefinition of it becomes unmeaning and useless in proportion to\nits abstractness.  To define beauty, not in the most abstract but in\nthe most concrete terms possible, to find not its universal\nformula, but the formula which expresses most adequately this or\nthat [viii] special manifestation of it, is the aim of the true student\nof aesthetics.",
        "“To see the object as in itself it really is,” has been justly said to\nbe the aim of all true criticism whatever, and in aesthetic\ncriticism the first step towards seeing one’s object as it really is,\nis to know one’s own impression as it really is, to discriminate it,\nto realise it distinctly.  The objects with which aesthetic criticism\ndeals–music, poetry, artistic and accomplished forms of human\nlife–are indeed receptacles of so many powers or forces: they\npossess, like the products of nature, so many virtues or qualities.\nWhat is this song or picture, this engaging personality presented\nin life or in a book, to me?  What effect does it really produce on\nme?  Does it give me pleasure?  and if so, what sort or degree of\npleasure?  How is my nature modified by its presence, and under\nits influence?  The answers to these questions are the original\nfacts with which the aesthetic critic has to do; and, as in the study\nof light, of morals, of number, one must realise such primary data\nfor one’s self, or not at all.  And he who experiences these\nimpressions strongly, and drives directly at the discrimination\nand analysis of them, has no need to trouble himself with the\nabstract question what beauty is in itself, or what its exact\nrelation to truth or [ix] experience–metaphysical questions, as\nunprofitable as metaphysical questions elsewhere.  He may pass\nthem all by as being, answerable or not, of no interest to him.",
        "The aesthetic critic, then, regards all the objects with which he\nhas to do, all works of art, and the fairer forms of nature and\nhuman life, as powers or forces producing pleasurable sensations,\neach of a more or less peculiar or unique kind.  This influence he\nfeels, and wishes to explain, by analysing and reducing it to its\nelements.  To him, the picture, the landscape, the engaging\npersonality in life or in a book, La Gioconda, the hills of Carrara,\nPico of Mirandola, are valuable for their virtues, as we say, in\nspeaking of a herb, a wine, a gem; for the property each has of\naffecting one with a special, a unique, impression of pleasure.\nOur education becomes complete in proportion as our\nsusceptibility to these impressions increases in depth and variety.\nAnd the function of the aesthetic critic is to distinguish, to\nanalyse, and separate from its adjuncts, the virtue by which a\npicture, a landscape, a fair personality in life or in a book,\nproduces this special impression of beauty or pleasure, to indicate\nwhat the source of that impression is, and under what conditions\nit is experienced.  His end is reached when he has disengaged that\n[x] virtue, and noted it, as a chemist notes some natural element,\nfor himself and others; and the rule for those who would reach\nthis end is stated with great exactness in the words of a recent\ncritic of Sainte-Beuve:–De se borner a connaitre de pres les\nbelles choses, et a s’en nourrir en exquis amateurs, en\nhumanistes accomplis.",
        "What is important, then, is not that the critic should possess a\ncorrect abstract definition of beauty for the intellect, but a certain\nkind of temperament, the power of being deeply moved by the\npresence of beautiful objects.  He will remember always that\nbeauty exists in many forms.  To him all periods, types, schools\nof taste, are in themselves equal.  In all ages there have been\nsome excellent workmen, and some excellent work done.  The\nquestion he asks is always:–In whom did the stir, the genius, the\nsentiment of the period find itself?  where was the receptacle of\nits refinement, its elevation, its taste?  “The ages are all equal,\"\nsays William Blake, “but genius is always above its age.”",
        "Often it will require great nicety to disengage this virtue from the\ncommoner elements with which it may be found in combination.\nFew artists, not Goethe or Byron even, work quite cleanly,\ncasting off all debris, and leaving us only what the heat of their\nimagination has wholly [xi] fused and transformed.  Take, for\ninstance, the writings of Wordsworth.  The heat of his genius,\nentering into the substance of his work, has crystallised a part,\nbut only a part, of it; and in that great mass of verse there is much\nwhich might well be forgotten.  But scattered up and down it,\nsometimes fusing and transforming entire compositions, like the\nStanzas on Resolution and Independence, or the Ode on the\nRecollections of Childhood, sometimes, as if at random,\ndepositing a fine crystal here or there, in a matter it does not\nwholly search through and transmute, we trace the action of his\nunique, incommunicable faculty, that strange, mystical sense of a\nlife in natural things, and of man’s life as a part of nature,\ndrawing strength and colour and character from local influences,\nfrom the hills and streams, and from natural sights and sounds.\nWell!  that is the virtue, the active principle in Wordsworth’s\npoetry; and then the function of the critic of Wordsworth is to\nfollow up that active principle, to disengage it, to mark the degree\nin which it penetrates his verse.",
        "The subjects of the following studies are taken from the history\nof the Renaissance, and touch what I think the chief points in that\ncomplex, many-sided movement.  I have explained in the first of\nthem what I understand by the word, [xii] giving it a much wider\nscope than was intended by those who originally used it to denote\nthat revival of classical antiquity in the fifteenth century which\nwas only one of many results of a general excitement and\nenlightening of the human mind, but of which the great aim and\nachievements of what, as Christian art, is often falsely opposed to\nthe Renaissance, were another result.  This outbreak of the human\nspirit may be traced far into the middle age itself, with its motives\nalready clearly pronounced, the care for physical beauty, the\nworship of the body, the breaking down of those limits which the\nreligious system of the middle age imposed on the heart and the\nimagination.  I have taken as an example of this movement, this\nearlier Renaissance within the middle age itself, and as an\nexpression of its qualities, two little compositions in early\nFrench; not because they constitute the best possible expression\nof them, but because they help the unity of my series, inasmuch\nas the Renaissance ends also in France, in French poetry, in a\nphase of which the writings of Joachim du Bellay are in many\nways the most perfect illustration.  The Renaissance, in truth, put\nforth in France an aftermath, a wonderful later growth, the\nproducts of which have to the full that subtle and delicate\nsweetness which belongs to a refined and comely [xiii]\ndecadence, just as its earliest phases have the freshness which\nbelongs to all periods of growth in art, the charm of ascesis, of\nthe austere and serious girding of the loins in youth.",
        "But it is in Italy, in the fifteenth century, that the interest of the\nRenaissance mainly lies,–in that solemn fifteenth century which\ncan hardly be studied too much, not merely for its positive results\nin the things of the intellect and the imagination, its concrete\nworks of art, its special and prominent personalities, with their\nprofound aesthetic charm, but for its general spirit and character,\nfor the ethical qualities of which it is a consummate type.",
        "The various forms of intellectual activity which together make\nup the culture of an age, move for the most part from different\nstarting-points, and by unconnected roads.  As products of the\nsame generation they partake indeed of a common character, and\nunconsciously illustrate each other; but of the producers\nthemselves, each group is solitary, gaining what advantage or\ndisadvantage there may be in intellectual isolation.  Art and\npoetry, philosophy and the religious life, and that other life of\nrefined pleasure and action in the conspicuous places of the\nworld, are each of them confined to its own circle of ideas, and\nthose who prosecute either of them are generally little [xiv]\ncurious of the thoughts of others.  There come, however, from\ntime to time, eras of more favourable conditions, in which the\nthoughts of men draw nearer together than is their wont, and the\nmany interests of the intellectual world combine in one complete\ntype of general culture.  The fifteenth century in Italy is one of\nthese happier eras, and what is sometimes said of the age of\nPericles is true of that of Lorenzo:–it is an age productive in\npersonalities, many-sided, centralised, complete.  Here, artists\nand philosophers and those whom the action of the world has\nelevated and made keen, do not live in isolation, but breathe a\ncommon air, and catch light and heat from each other’s thoughts.\nThere is a spirit of general elevation and enlightenment in which\nall alike communicate.  The unity of this spirit gives unity to all\nthe various products of the Renaissance; and it is to this intimate\nalliance with the mind, this participation in the best thoughts\nwhich that age produced, that the art of Italy in the fifteenth\ncentury owes much of its grave dignity and influence.",
        "I have added an essay on Winckelmann, as not incongruous with\nthe studies which precede it, because Winckelmann, coming in\nthe eighteenth century, really belongs in spirit to an earlier age.\nBy his enthusiasm for the things of the intellect [xv] and the\nimagination for their own sake, by his Hellenism, his life-long\nstruggle to attain the Greek spirit, he is in sympathy with the\nhumanists of a previous century.  He is the last fruit of the\nRenaissance, and explains in a striking way its motive and\ntendencies.",
