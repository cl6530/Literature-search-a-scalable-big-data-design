        "\n\n",
        "(ll. 1-4)  Beginning with thee, O Phoebus, I will recount the\nfamous deeds of men of old, who, at the behest of King Pelias,\ndown through the mouth of Pontus and between the Cyanean rocks,\nsped well-benched Argo in quest of the golden fleece.",
        "(ll. 5-17)  Such was the oracle that Pelias heard, that a hateful\ndoom awaited him to be slain at the prompting of the man whom he\nshould see coming forth from the people with but one sandal.  And\nno long time after, in accordance with that true report, Jason\ncrossed the stream of wintry Anaurus on foot, and saved one\nsandal from the mire, but the other he left in the depths held\nback by the flood.  And straightway he came to Pelias to share\nthe banquet which the king was offering to his father Poseidon\nand the rest of the gods, though he paid no honour to Pelasgian\nHera.  Quickly the king saw him and pondered, and devised for him\nthe toil of a troublous voyage, in order that on the sea or among\nstrangers he might lose his home-return.",
        "(ll. 18-22)  The ship, as former bards relate, Argus wrought by\nthe guidance of Athena.  But now I will tell the lineage and the\nnames of the heroes, and of the long sea-paths and the deeds they\nwrought in their wanderings; may the Muses be the inspirers of my\nsong!",
        "(ll. 23-34)  First then let us name Orpheus whom once Calliope\nbare, it is said, wedded to Thracian Oeagrus, near the Pimpleian\nheight.  Men say that he by the music of his songs charmed the\nstubborn rocks upon the mountains and the course of rivers.  And\nthe wild oak-trees to this day, tokens of that magic strain, that\ngrow at Zone on the Thracian shore, stand in ordered ranks close\ntogether, the same which under the charm of his lyre he led down\nfrom Pieria.  Such then was Orpheus whom Aeson’s son welcomed to\nshare his toils, in obedience to the behest of Cheiron, Orpheus\nruler of Bistonian Pieria.",
        "(ll. 35-39)  Straightway came Asterion, whom Cometes begat by the\nwaters of eddying Apidanus; he dwelt at Peiresiae near the\nPhylleian mount, where mighty Apidanus and bright Enipeus join\ntheir streams, coming together from afar.",
        "(ll. 40-44)  Next to them from Larisa came Polyphemus, son of\nEilatus, who aforetime among the mighty Lapithae, when they were\narming themselves against the Centaurs, fought in his younger\ndays; now his limbs were grown heavy with age, but his martial\nspirit still remained, even as of old.",
        "(ll. 45-48)  Nor was Iphiclus long left behind in Phylace, the\nuncle of Aeson’s son; for Aeson had wedded his sister Alcimede,\ndaughter of Phylacus: his kinship with her bade him be numbered\nin the host.",
        "(ll. 49-50)  Nor did Admetus, the lord of Pherae rich in sheep,\nstay behind beneath the peak of the Chalcodonian mount.",
        "(ll. 51-56)  Nor at Alope stayed the sons of Hermes, rich in\ncorn-land, well skilled in craftiness, Erytus and Echion, and\nwith them on their departure their kinsman Aethalides went as the\nthird; him near the streams of Amphrysus Eupolemeia bare, the\ndaughter of Myrmidon, from Phthia; the two others were sprung\nfrom Antianeira, daughter of Menetes.",
        "(ll. 57-64)  From rich Gyrton came Coronus, son of Caeneus,\nbrave, but not braver than his father.  For bards relate that\nCaeneus though still living perished at the hands of the\nCentaurs, when apart from other chiefs he routed them; and they,\nrallying against him, could neither bend nor slay him; but\nunconquered and unflinching he passed beneath the earth,\noverwhelmed by the downrush of massy pines.",
        "(ll. 65-68)  There came too Titaresian Mopsus, whom above all men\nthe son of Leto taught the augury of birds; and Eurydamas the son\nof Ctimenus; he dwelt at Dolopian Ctimene near the Xynian lake.",
        "(ll. 69-70)  Moreover Actor sent his son Menoetius from Opus that\nhe might accompany the chiefs.",
        "(ll. 71-76)  Eurytion followed and strong Eribotes, one the son\nof Teleon, the other of Irus, Actor’s son; the son of Teleon\nrenowned Eribotes, and of Irus Eurytion.  A third with them was\nOileus, peerless in courage and well skilled to attack the flying\nfoe, when they break their ranks.",
        "(ll. 77-85)  Now from Euboea came Canthus eager for the quest,\nwhom Canethus son of Abas sent; but he was not destined to return\nto Cerinthus.  For fate had ordained that he and Mopsus, skilled\nin the seer’s art, should wander and perish in the furthest ends\nof Libya.  For no ill is too remote for mortals to incur, seeing\nthat they buried them in Libya, as far from the Colchians as is\nthe space that is seen between the setting and the rising of the\nsun.",
        "(ll. 86-89)  To him Clytius and Iphitus joined themselves, the\nwarders of Oechalia, sons of Eurytus the ruthless, Eurytus, to\nwhom the Far-shooting god gave his bow; but he had no joy of the\ngift; for of his own choice he strove even with the giver.",
        "(ll. 90-94)  After them came the sons of Aeacus, not both\ntogether, nor from the same spot; for they settled far from\nAegina in exile, when in their folly they had slain their brother\nPhoeus.  Telamon dwelt in the Attic island; but Peleus departed\nand made his home in Phthia.",
        "(ll. 95-104)  After them from Cecropia came warlike Butes, son of\nbrave Teleon, and Phalerus of the ashen spear.  Alcon his father\nsent him forth; yet no other sons had he to care for his old age\nand livelihood.  But him, his well-beloved and only son, he sent\nforth that amid bold heroes he might shine conspicuous.  But\nTheseus, who surpassed all the sons of Erechtheus, an unseen bond\nkept beneath the land of Taenarus, for he had followed that path\nwith Peirithous; assuredly both would have lightened for all the\nfulfilment of their toil.",
        "(ll. 105-114)  Tiphys, son of Hagnias, left the Siphaean people\nof the Thespians, well skilled to foretell the rising wave on the\nbroad sea, and well skilled to infer from sun and star the stormy\nwinds and the time for sailing.  Tritonian Athena herself urged\nhim to join the band of chiefs, and he came among them a welcome\ncomrade.  She herself too fashioned the swift ship; and with her\nArgus, son of Arestor, wrought it by her counsels.  Wherefore it\nproved the most excellent of all ships that have made trial of\nthe sea with oars.",
        "(ll. 115-117)  After them came Phlias from Araethyrea, where he\ndwelt in affluence by the favour of his father Dionysus, in his\nhome by the springs of Asopus.",
        "(ll. 118-121)  From Argos came Talaus and Areius, sons of Bias,\nand mighty Leodocus, all of whom Pero daughter of Neleus bare; on\nher account the Aeolid Melampus endured sore affliction in the\nsteading of Iphiclus.",
        "(ll. 122-132)  Nor do we learn that Heracles of the mighty heart\ndisregarded the eager summons of Aeson’s son.  But when he heard\na report of the heroes’ gathering and had reached Lyrceian Argos\nfrom Arcadia by the road along which he carried the boar alive\nthat fed in the thickets of Lampeia, near the vast Erymanthian\nswamp, the boar bound with chains he put down from his huge\nshoulders at the entrance to the market-place of Mycenae; and\nhimself of his own will set out against the purpose of\nEurystheus; and with him went Hylas, a brave comrade, in the\nflower of youth, to bear his arrows and to guard his bow.",
        "(ll. 133-138)  Next to him came a scion of the race of divine\nDanaus, Nauplius.  He was the son of Clytonaeus son of Naubolus;\nNaubolus was son of Lernus; Lernus we know was the son of Proetus\nson of Nauplius; and once Amymone daughter of Danaus, wedded to\nPoseidon, bare Nauplius, who surpassed all men in naval skill.",
        "(ll. 139-145)  Idmon came last of all them that dwelt at Argos,\nfor though he had learnt his own fate by augury, he came, that\nthe people might not grudge him fair renown.  He was not in truth\nthe son of Abas, but Leto’s son himself begat him to be numbered\namong the illustrious Aeolids; and himself taught him the art of\nprophecy–to pay heed to birds and to observe the signs of the\nburning sacrifice.",
        "(ll. 146-150)  Moreover Aetolian Leda sent from Sparta strong\nPolydeuces and Castor, skilled to guide swift-footed steeds;\nthese her dearly-loved sons she bare at one birth in the house of\nTyndareus; nor did she forbid their departure; for she had\nthoughts worthy of the bride of Zeus.",
        "(ll. 151-155)  The sons of Aphareus, Lynceus and proud Idas, came\nfrom Arene, both exulting in their great strength; and Lynceus\ntoo excelled in keenest sight, if the report is true that that\nhero could easily direct his sight even beneath the earth.",
        "(ll. 156-160)  And with them Neleian Periclymenus set out to\ncome, eldest of all the sons of godlike Neleus who were born at\nPylos; Poseidon had given him boundless strength and granted him\nthat whatever shape he should crave during the fight, that he\nshould take in the stress of battle.",
        "(ll. 161-171)  Moreover from Arcadia came Amphidamas and Cepheus,\nwho inhabited Tegea and the allotment of Apheidas, two sons of\nAldus; and Ancaeus followed them as the third, whom his father\nLycurgus sent, the brother older than both.  But he was left in\nthe city to care for Aleus now growing old, while he gave his son\nto join his brothers.  Antaeus went clad in the skin of a\nMaenalian bear, and wielding in his right hand a huge two-edged\nbattleaxe.  For his armour his grandsire had hidden in the\nhouse’s innermost recess, to see if he might by some means still\nstay his departure.",
        "(ll. 172-175)  There came also Augeias, whom fame declared to be\nthe son of Helios; he reigned over the Eleans, glorying in his\nwealth; and greatly he desired to behold the Colchian land and\nAeetes himself the ruler of the Colchians.",
        "(ll. 176-178)  Asterius and Amphion, sons of Hyperasius, came\nfrom Achaean Pellene, which once Pelles their grandsire founded\non the brows of Aegialus.",
        "(ll. 179-184)  After them from Taenarus came Euphemus whom, most\nswift-footed of men, Europe, daughter of mighty Tityos, bare to\nPoseidon.  He was wont to skim the swell of the grey sea, and\nwetted not his swift feet, but just dipping the tips of his toes\nwas borne on the watery path.",
        "(ll. 185-189)  Yea, and two other sons of Poseidon came; one\nErginus, who left the citadel of glorious Miletus, the other\nproud Ancaeus, who left Parthenia, the seat of Imbrasion Hera;\nboth boasted their skill in seacraft and in war.",
        "(ll. 190-201)  After them from Calydon came the son of Oeneus,\nstrong Meleagrus, and Laocoon–Laocoon the brother of Oeneus,\nthough not by the same mother, for a serving-woman bare him; him,\nnow growing old, Oeneus sent to guard his son: thus Meleagrus,\nstill a youth, entered the bold band of heroes.  No other had\ncome superior to him, I ween, except Heracles, if for one year\nmore he had tarried and been nurtured among the Aetolians.  Yea,\nand his uncle, well skilled to fight whether with the javelin or\nhand to hand, Iphiclus son of Thestius, bare him company on his\nway.",
        "(ll. 202-206)  With him came Palaemonius, son of Olenian Lernus,\nof Lernus by repute, but his birth was from Hephaestus; and so he\nwas crippled in his feet, but his bodily frame and his valour no\none would dare to scorn.  Wherefore he was numbered among all the\nchiefs, winning fame for Jason.",
        "(ll. 207-210)  From the Phocians came Iphitus sprung from\nNaubolus son of Ornytus; once he had been his host when Jason\nwent to Pytho to ask for a response concerning his voyage; for\nthere he welcomed him in his own hails.",
        "(ll. 211-223)  Next came Zetes and Calais, sons of Boreas, whom\nonce Oreithyia, daughter of Erechtheus, bare to Boreas on the\nverge of wintry Thrace; thither it was that Thracian Boreas\nsnatched her away from Cecropia as she was whirling in the dance,\nhard by Hissus’ stream.  And, carrying her far off, to the spot\nthat men called the rock of Sarpedon, near the river Erginus, he\nwrapped her in dark clouds and forced her to his will.  There\nthey were making their dusky wings quiver upon their ankles on\nboth sides as they rose, a great wonder to behold, wings that\ngleamed with golden scales: and round their backs from the top of\nthe head and neck, hither and thither, their dark tresses were\nbeing shaken by the wind.",
        "(ll. 224-227)  No, nor had Acastus son of mighty Pelias himself\nany will to stay behind in the palace of his brave sire, nor\nArgus, helper of the goddess Athena; but they too were ready to\nbe numbered in the host.",
        "(ll. 228-233)  So many then were the helpers who assembled to\njoin the son of Aeson.  All the chiefs the dwellers thereabout\ncalled Minyae, for the most and the bravest avowed that they were\nsprung from the blood of the daughters of Minyas; thus Jason\nhimself was the son of Alcimede who was born of Clymene the\ndaughter of Minyas.",
        "(ll. 234-241)  Now when all things had been made ready by the\nthralls, all things that fully-equipped ships are furnished\nwithal when men’s business leads them to voyage across the sea,\nthen the heroes took their way through the city to the ship where\nit lay on the strand that men call Magnesian Pagasae; and a crowd\nof people hastening rushed together; but the heroes shone like\ngleaming stars among the clouds; and each man as he saw them\nspeeding along with their armour would say:",
        "(ll. 242-246)  “King Zeus, what is the purpose of Pelias? \nWhither is he driving forth from the Panachaean land so great a\nhost of heroes?  On one day they would waste the palace of Aeetes\nwith baleful fire, should he not yield them the fleece of his own\ngoodwill.  But the path is not to be shunned, the toil is hard\nfor those who venture.”",
        "(ll. 247-250)  Thus they spake here and there throughout the\ncity; but the women often raised their hands to the sky in prayer\nto the immortals to grant a return, their hearts’ desire.  And\none with tears thus lamented to her fellow:",
        "(ll. 251-260)  “Wretched Alcimede, evil has come to thee at last\nthough late, thou hast not ended with splendour of life.  Aeson\ntoo, ill-fated man!  Surely better had it been for him, if he\nwere lying beneath the earth, enveloped in his shroud, still\nunconscious of bitter toils.  Would that the dark wave, when the\nmaiden Helle perished, had overwhelmed Phrixus too with the ram;\nbut the dire portent even sent forth a human voice, that it might\ncause to Alcimede sorrows and countless pains hereafter.”",
        "(ll. 261-277)  Thus the women spake at the departure of the\nheroes.  And now many thralls, men and women, were gathered\ntogether, and his mother, smitten with grief for Jason.  And a\nbitter pang seized every woman’s heart; and with them groaned the\nfather in baleful old age, lying on his bed, closely wrapped\nround.  But the hero straightway soothed their pain, encouraging\nthem, and bade the thralls take up his weapons for war; and they\nin silence with downcast looks took them up.  And even as the\nmother had thrown her arms about her son, so she clung, weeping\nwithout stint, as a maiden all alone weeps, falling fondly on the\nneck of her hoary nurse, a maid who has now no others to care for\nher, but she drags on a weary life under a stepmother, who\nmaltreats her continually with ever fresh insults, and as she\nweeps, her heart within her is bound fast with misery, nor can\nshe sob forth all the groans that struggle for utterance; so\nwithout stint wept Alcimede straining her son in her arms, and in\nher yearning grief spake as follows:",
        "(ll. 278-291)  “Would that on that day when, wretched woman that\nI am, I heard King Pelias proclaim his evil behest, I had\nstraightway given up my life and forgotten my cares, so that thou\nthyself, my son, with thine own hands, mightest have buried me;\nfor that was the only wish left me still to be fulfilled by time,\nall the other rewards for thy nurture have I long enjoyed.  Now\nI, once so admired among Achaean women, shall be left behind like\na bondwoman in my empty halls, pining away, ill-fated one, for\nlove of thee, thee on whose account I had aforetime so much\nsplendour and renown, my only son for whom I loosed my virgin\nzone first and last.  For to me beyond others the goddess\nEileithyia grudged abundant offspring.  Alas for my folly!  Not\nonce, not even in nay dreams did I forebode this, that the flight\nof Phrixus would bring me woe.”",
        "(ll. 292-294)  Thus with moaning she wept, and her handmaidens,\nstanding by, lamented; but Jason spake gently to her with\ncomforting words:",
        "(ll. 295-305)  “Do not, I pray thee, mother, store up bitter\nsorrows overmuch, for thou wilt not redeem me from evil by tears,\nbut wilt still add grief to grief.  For unseen are the woes that\nthe gods mete out to mortals; be strong to endure thy share of\nthem though with grief in thy heart; take courage from the\npromises of Athena, and from the answers of the gods (for very\nfavourable oracles has Phoebus given), and then from the help of\nthe chieftains.  But do thou remain here, quiet among thy\nhandmaids, and be not a bird of ill omen to the ship; and thither\nmy clansmen and thralls will follow me.”",
        "(ll. 306-316)  He spake, and started forth to leave the house.\nAnd as Apollo goes forth from some fragrant shrine to divine\nDelos or Claros or Pytho or to broad Lyeia near the stream of\nXanthus, in such beauty moved Jason through the throng of people;\nand a cry arose as they shouted together.  And there met him aged\nIphias, priestess of Artemis guardian of the city, and kissed his\nright hand, but she had not strength to say a word, for all her\neagerness, as the crowd rushed on, but she was left there by the\nwayside, as the old are left by the young, and he passed on and\nwas gone afar.",
        "(ll. 317-331)  Now when he had left the well-built streets of the\ncity, he came to the beach of Pagasae, where his comrades greeted\nhim as they stayed together near the ship Argo.  And he stood at\nthe entering in, and they were gathered to meet him.  And they\nperceived Aeastus and Argus coming from the city, and they\nmarvelled when they saw them hasting with all speed, despite the\nwill of Pelias.  The one, Argus, son of Arestor, had cast round\nhis shoulders the hide of a bull reaching to his feet, with the\nblack hair upon it, the other, a fair mantle of double fold,\nwhich his sister Pelopeia had given him.  Still Jason forebore\nfrom asking them about each point but bade all be seated for an\nassembly.  And there, upon the folded sails and the mast as it\nlay on the ground, they all took their seats in order.  And among\nthem with goodwill spake Aeson’s son:",
        "(ll. 332-340)  “All the equipment that a ship needs for all is in\ndue order–lies ready for our departure.  Therefore we will\nmake no long delay in our sailing for these things’ sake, when\nthe breezes but blow fair.  But, friends,–for common to all is\nour return to Hellas hereafter, and common to all is our path to\nthe land of Aeetes–now therefore with ungrudging heart choose\nthe bravest to be our leader, who shall be careful for\neverything, to take upon him our quarrels and covenants with\nstrangers.”",
        "(ll. 341-344)  Thus he spake; and the young heroes turned their\neyes towards bold Heracles sitting in their midst, and with one\nshout they all enjoined upon him to be their leader; but he, from\nthe place where he sat, stretched forth his right hand and said:",
        "(ll. 345-347)  “Let no one offer this honour to me.  For I will\nnot consent, and I will forbid any other to stand up.  Let the\nhero who brought us together, himself be the leader of the host.”",
        "(ll. 348-350)  Thus he spake with high thoughts, and they\nassented, as Heracles bade; and warlike Jason himself rose up,\nglad at heart, and thus addressed the eager throng:",
        "(ll. 351-362)  “If ye entrust your glory to my care, no longer as\nbefore let our path be hindered.  Now at last let us propitiate\nPhoebus with sacrifice and straightway prepare a feast.  And\nuntil my thralls come, the overseers of my steading, whose care\nit is to choose out oxen from the herd and drive them hither, we\nwill drag down the ship to the sea, and do ye place all the\ntackling within, and draw lots for the benches for rowing.\nMeantime let us build upon the beach an altar to Apollo Embasius\n(1) who by an oracle promised to point out and show me the paths\nof the sea, if by sacrifice to him I should begin my venture for\nKing Pelias.”",
        "(ll. 363-393)  He spake, and was the first to turn to the work,\nand they stood up in obedience to him; and they heaped their\ngarments, one upon the other, on a smooth stone, which the sea\ndid not strike with its waves, but the stormy surge had cleansed\nit long before.  First of all, by the command of Argus, they\nstrongly girded the ship with a rope well twisted within, (2)\nstretching it tight on each side, in order that the planks might\nbe well compacted by the bolts and might withstand the opposing\nforce of the surge.  And they quickly dug a trench as wide as the\nspace the ship covered, and at the prow as far into the sea as it\nwould run when drawn down by their hands.  And they ever dug\ndeeper in front of the stem, and in the furrow laid polished\nrollers; and inclined the ship down upon the first rollers, that\nso she might glide and be borne on by them.  And above, on both\nsides, reversing the oars, they fastened them round the thole-\npins, so as to project a cubit’s space.  And the heroes\nthemselves stood on both sides at the oars in a row, and pushed\nforward with chest and hand at once.  And then Tiphys leapt on\nboard to urge the youths to push at the right moment; and calling\non them he shouted loudly; and they at once, leaning with all\ntheir strength, with one push started the ship from her place,\nand strained with their feet, forcing her onward; and Pelian Argo\nfollowed swiftly; and they on each side shouted as they rushed\non.  And then the rollers groaned under the sturdy keel as they\nwere chafed, and round them rose up a dark smoke owing to the\nweight, and she glided into the sea; but the heroes stood there\nand kept dragging her back as she sped onward.  And round the\nthole-pins they fitted the oars, and in the ship they placed the\nmast and the well-made sails and the stores.",
        "(ll. 394-401)  Now when they had carefully paid heed to\neverything, first they distributed the benches by lot, two men\noccupying one seat; but the middle bench they chose for Heracles\nand Ancaeus apart from the other heroes, Ancaeus who dwelt in\nTegea.  For them alone they left the middle bench just as it was\nand not by lot; and with one consent they entrusted Tiphys with\nguarding the helm of the well-stemmed ship.",
        "(ll. 402-410)  Next, piling up shingle near the sea, they raised\nthere an altar on the shore to Apollo, under the name of Actius\n(3) and Embasius, and quickly spread above it logs of dried\nolive-wood.  Meantime the herdsmen of Aeson’s son had driven\nbefore them from the herd two steers.  These the younger comrades\ndragged near the altars, and the others brought lustral water and\nbarley meal, and Jason prayed, calling on Apollo the god of his\nfathers:",
        "(ll. 411-424)  “Hear, O King, that dwellest in Pagasae and the\ncity Aesonis, the city called by my father’s name, thou who didst\npromise me, when I sought thy oracle at Pytho, to show the\nfulfilment and goal of my journey, for thou thyself hast been the\ncause of my venture; now do thou thyself guide the ship with my\ncomrades safe and sound, thither and back again to Hellas.  Then\nin thy honour hereafter we will lay again on thy altar the bright\nofferings of bulls–all of us who return; and other gifts in\ncountless numbers I will bring to Pytho and Ortygia.  And now,\ncome, Far-darter, accept this sacrifice at our hands, which first\nof all we have offered thee for this ship on our embarcation; and\ngrant, O King, that with a prosperous weird I may loose the\nhawsers, relying on thy counsel, and may the breeze blow softly\nwith which we shall sail over the sea in fair weather.”",
        "(ll. 425-439)  He spake, and with his prayer cast the barley\nmeal.  And they two girded themselves to slay the steers, proud\nAncaeus and Heracles.  The latter with his club smote one steer\nmid-head on the brow, and falling in a heap on the spot, it sank\nto the ground; and Ancaeus struck the broad neck of the other\nwith his axe of bronze, and shore through the mighty sinews; and\nit fell prone on both its horns.  Their comrades quickly severed\nthe victims’ throats, and flayed the hides: they sundered the\njoints and carved the flesh, then cut out the sacred thigh bones,\nand covering them all together closely with fat burnt them upon\ncloven wood.  And Aeson’s son poured out pure libations, and\nIdmon rejoiced beholding the flame as it gleamed on every side\nfrom the sacrifice, and the smoke of it mounting up with good\nomen in dark spiral columns; and quickly he spake outright the\nwill of Leto’s son:",
        "(ll. 440-447)  “For you it is the will of heaven and destiny that\nye shall return here with the fleece; but meanwhile both going\nand returning, countless trials await you.  But it is my lot, by\nthe hateful decree of a god, to die somewhere afar off on the\nmainland of Asia.  Thus, though I learnt my fate from evil omens\neven before now, I have left my fatherland to embark on the ship,\nthat so after my embarking fair fame may be left me in my house.”",
        "(ll. 448-462)  Thus he spake; and the youths hearing the divine\nutterance rejoiced at their return, but grief seized them for the\nfate of Idmon.  Now at the hour when the sun passes his noon-tide\nhalt and the ploughlands are just being shadowed by the rocks, as\nthe sun slopes towards the evening dusk, at that hour all the\nheroes spread leaves thickly upon the sand and lay down in rows\nin front of the hoary surf-line; and near them were spread vast\nstores of viands and sweet wine, which the cupbearers had drawn\noff in pitchers; afterwards they told tales one to another in\nturn, such as youths often tell when at the feast and the bowl\nthey take delightful pastime, and insatiable insolence is far\naway.  But here the son of Aeson, all helpless, was brooding over\neach event in his mind, like one oppressed with thought.  And\nIdas noted him and assailed him with loud voice:",
        "(ll. 463-471)  “Son of Aeson, what is this plan thou art turning\nover in mind.  Speak out thy thought in the midst.  Does fear\ncome on and master thee, fear, that confounds cowards?  Be\nwitness now my impetuous spear, wherewith in wars I win renown\nbeyond all others (nor does Zeus aid me so much as my own spear),\nthat no woe will be fatal, no venture will be unachieved, while\nIdas follows, even though a god should oppose thee.  Such a\nhelpmeet am I that thou bringest from Arene.”",
        "(ll. 472-475)  He spake, and holding a brimming goblet in both\nhands drank off the unmixed sweet wine; and his lips and dark\ncheeks were drenched with it; and all the heroes clamoured\ntogether and Idmon spoke out openly:",
        "(ll. 480-484)  “Vain wretch, thou art devising destruction for\nthyself before the time.  Does the pure wine cause thy bold heart\nto swell in thy breast to thy ruin, and has it set thee on to\ndishonour the gods?  Other words of comfort there are with which\na man might encourage his comrade; but thou hast spoken with\nutter recklessness.  Such taunts, the tale goes, did the sons of\nAloeus once blurt out against the blessed gods, and thou dost no\nwise equal them in valour; nevertheless they were both slain by\nthe swift arrows of Leto’s son, mighty though they were.”",
        "(ll. 485-486)  Thus he spake, and Aphareian Iclas laughed out,\nloud and long, and eyeing him askance replied with biting words:",
        "(ll. 487-491)  “Come now, tell me this by thy prophetic art,\nwhether for me too the gods will bring to pass such doom as thy\nfather promised for the sons of Aloeus.  And bethink thee how\nthou wilt escape from my hands alive, if thou art caught making a\nprophecy vain as the idle wind.”",
        "(ll. 492-495)  Thus in wrath Idas reviled him, and the strife\nwould have gone further had not their comrades and Aeson’s son\nhimself with indignant cry restrained the contending chiefs; and\nOrpheus lifted his lyre in his left hand and made essay to sing.",
        "(ll. 496-511)  He sang how the earth, the heaven and the sea,\nonce mingled together in one form, after deadly strife were\nseparated each from other; and how the stars and the moon and the\npaths of the sun ever keep their fixed place in the sky; and how\nthe mountains rose, and how the resounding rivers with their\nnymphs came into being and all creeping things.  And he sang how\nfirst of all Ophion and Eurynome, daughter of Ocean, held the\nsway of snowy Olympus, and how through strength of arm one\nyielded his prerogative to Cronos and the other to Rhea, and how\nthey fell into the waves of Ocean; but the other two meanwhile\nruled over the blessed Titan-gods, while Zeus, still a child and\nwith the thoughts of a child, dwelt in the Dictaean cave; and the\nearthborn Cyclopes had not yet armed him with the bolt, with\nthunder and lightning; for these things give renown to Zeus.",
        "(ll. 512-518)  He ended, and stayed his lyre and divine voice.\nBut though he had ceased they still bent forward with eagerness\nall hushed to quiet, with ears intent on the enchanting strain;\nsuch a charm of song had he left behind in their hearts.  Not\nlong after they mixed libations in honour of Zeus, with pious\nrites as is customary, and poured them upon the burning tongues,\nand bethought them of sleep in the darkness.",
        "(ll. 519-558)  Now when gleaming dawn with bright eyes beheld the\nlofty peaks of Pelion, and the calm headlands were being drenched\nas the sea was ruffled by the winds, then Tiphys awoke from\nsleep; and at once he roused his comrades to go on board and make\nready the oars.  And a strange cry did the harbour of Pagasae\nutter, yea and Pelian Argo herself, urging them to set forth. \nFor in her a beam divine had been laid which Athena had brought\nfrom an oak of Dodona and fitted in the middle of the stem.  And\nthe heroes went to the benches one after the other, as they had\npreviously assigned for each to row in his place, and took their\nseats in due order near their fighting gear.  In the middle sat\nAntaeus and mighty Heracles, and near him he laid his club, and\nbeneath his tread the ship’s keel sank deep.  And now the hawsers\nwere being slipped and they poured wine on the sea.  But Jason\nwith tears held his eyes away from his fatherland.  And just as\nyouths set up a dance in honour of Phoebus either in Pytho or\nhaply in Ortygia, or by the waters of Ismenus, and to the sound\nof the lyre round his altar all together in time beat the earth\nwith swiftly-moving feet; so they to the sound of Orpheus’ lyre\nsmote with their oars the rushing sea-water, and the surge broke\nover the blades; and on this side and on that the dark brine\nseethed with foam, boiling terribly through the might of the\nsturdy heroes.  And their arms shone in the sun like flame as the\nship sped on; and ever their wake gleamed white far behind, like\na path seen over a green plain.  On that day all the gods looked\ndown from heaven upon the ship and the might of the heroes, half-\ndivine, the bravest of men then sailing the sea; and on the\ntopmost heights the nymphs of Pelion wondered as they beheld the\nwork of Itonian Athena, and the heroes themselves wielding the\noars.  And there came down from the mountain-top to the sea\nChiron, son of Philyra, and where the white surf broke he dipped\nhis feet, and, often waving with his broad hand, cried out to\nthem at their departure, “Good speed and a sorrowless home-\nreturn!”  And with him his wife, bearing Peleus’ son Achilles on\nher arm, showed the child to his dear father.",
        "(ll. 559-579)  Now when they had left the curving shore of the\nharbour through the cunning and counsel of prudent Tiphys son of\nHagnias, who skilfully handled the well-polished helm that he\nmight guide them steadfastly, then at length they set up the tall\nmast in the mastbox, and secured it with forestays, drawing them\ntaut on each side, and from it they let down the sail when they\nhad hauled it to the top-mast.  And a breeze came down piping\nshrilly; and upon the deck they fastened the ropes separately\nround the well-polished pins, and ran quietly past the long\nTisaean headland.  And for them the son of Oeagrus touched his\nlyre and sang in rhythmical song of Artemis, saviour of ships,\nchild of a glorious sire, who hath in her keeping those peaks by\nthe sea, and the land of Iolcos; and the fishes came darting\nthrough the deep sea, great mixed with small, and followed\ngambolling along the watery paths.  And as when in the track of\nthe shepherd, their master, countless sheep follow to the fold\nthat have fed to the full of grass, and he goes before gaily\npiping a shepherd’s strain on Iris shrill reed; so these fishes\nfollowed; and a chasing breeze ever bore the ship onward.",
        "(ll. 580-591)  And straightway the misty land of the Pelasgians,\nrich in cornfields, sank out of sight, and ever speeding onward\nthey passed the rugged sides of Pelion; and the Sepian headland\nsank away, and Sciathus appeared in the sea, and far off appeared\nPiresiae and the calm shore of Magnesia on the mainland and the\ntomb of Dolops; here then in the evening, as the wind blew\nagainst them, they put to land, and paying honour to him at\nnightfall burnt sheep as victims, while the sea was tossed by\nthe swell: and for two days they lingered on the shore, but on\nthe third day they put forth the ship, spreading on high the\nbroad sail.  And even now men call that beach Aphetae (4) of\nArgo.",
        "(ll. 592-608)  Thence going forward they ran past Meliboea,\nescaping a stormy beach and surf-line.  And in the morning they\nsaw Homole close at hand leaning on the sea, and skirted it, and\nnot long after they were about to pass by the outfall of the\nriver Amyrus.  From there they beheld Eurymenae and the seawashed\nravines of Ossa and Olympus; next they reached the slopes of\nPallene, beyond the headland of Canastra, running all night with\nthe wind.  And at dawn before them as they journeyed rose Athos,\nthe Thracian mountain, which with its topmost peak overshadows\nLemnos, even as far as Myrine, though it lies as far off as the\nspace that a well-trimmed merchantship would traverse up to\nmid-day.  For them on that day, till darkness fell, the breeze\nblew exceedingly fresh, and the sails of the ship strained to it.\nBut with the setting of the sun the wind left them, and it was by\nthe oars that they reached Lemnos, the Sintian isle.",
        "(ll. 609-639)  Here the whole of the men of the people together\nhad been ruthlessly slain through the transgressions of the women\nin the year gone by.  For the men had rejected their lawful\nwives, loathing them, and had conceived a fierce passion for\ncaptive maids whom they themselves brought across the sea from\ntheir forays in Thrace; for the terrible wrath of Cypris came\nupon them, because for a long time they had grudged her the\nhonours due.  O hapless women, and insatiate in jealousy to their\nown ruin!  Not their husbands alone with the captives did they\nslay on account of the marriage-bed, but all the males at the\nsame time, that they might thereafter pay no retribution for the\ngrim murder.  And of all the women, Hypsipyle alone spared her\naged father Thoas, who was king over the people; and she sent him\nin a hollow chest, to drift over the sea, if haply he should\nescape.  And fishermen dragged him to shore at the island of\nOenoe, formerly Oenoe, but afterwards called Sicinus from\nSicinus, whom the water-nymph Oenoe bore to Thoas.  Now for all\nthe women to tend kine, to don armour of bronze, and to cleave\nwith the plough-share the wheat-bearing fields, was easier than\nthe works of Athena, with which they were busied aforetime.  Yet\nfor all that did they often gaze over the broad sea, in grievous\nfear against the Thracians’ coming.  So when they saw Argo being\nrowed near the island, straightway crowding in multitude from the\ngates of Myrine and clad in their harness of war, they poured\nforth to the beach like ravening Thyiades: for they deemed that\nthe Thracians were come; and with them Hypsipyle, daughter of\nThoas, donned her father’s harness.  And they streamed down\nspeechless with dismay; such fear was wafted about them.",
        "(ll. 640-652)  Meantime from the ship the chiefs had sent\nAethalides the swift herald, to whose care they entrusted their\nmessages and the wand of Hermes, his sire, who had granted him a\nmemory of all things, that never grew dim; and not even now,\nthough he has entered the unspeakable whirlpools of Acheron, has\nforgetfulness swept over his soul, but its fixed doom is to be\never changing its abode; at one time to be numbered among the\ndwellers beneath the earth, at another to be in the light of the\nsun among living men.  But why need I tell at length tales of\nAethalides?  He at that time persuaded Hypsipyle to receive the\nnew-comers as the day was waning into darkness; nor yet at dawn\ndid they loose the ship’s hawsers to the breath of the north\nwind.",
        "(ll. 653-656)  Now the Lemnian women fared through the city and\nsat down to the assembly, for Hypsipyle herself had so bidden.\nAnd when they were all gathered together in one great throng\nstraightway she spake among them with stirring words:",
        "(ll. 657-666)  “O friends, come let us grant these men gifts to\ntheir hearts’ desire, such as it is fitting that they should take\non ship-board, food and sweet wine, in order that they may\nsteadfastly remain outside our towers, and may not, passing among\nus for need’s sake, get to know us all too well, and so an evil\nreport be widely spread; for we have wrought a terrible deed and\nin nowise will it be to their liking, should they learn it.  Such\nis our counsel now, but if any of you can devise a better plan\nlet her rise, for it was on this account that I summoned you\nhither.”",
        "(ll. 667-674)  Thus she spake and sat upon her father’s seat of\nstone, and then rose up her dear nurse Polyxo, for very age\nhalting upon her withered feet, bowed over a staff, and she was\neager to address them.  Near her were seated four virgins,\nunwedded, crowned with white hair.  And she stood in the midst of\nthe assembly and from her bent back she feebly raised her neck\nand spake thus:",
        "(ll. 675-696)  “Gifts, as Hypsipyle herself wishes, let us send\nto the strangers, for it is better to give them.  But for you\nwhat device have ye to get profit of your life if the Thracian\nhost fall upon us, or some other foe, as often happens among men,\neven as now this company is come unforeseen?  But if one of the\nblessed gods should turn this aside yet countless other woes,\nworse than battle, remain behind, when the aged women die off and\nye younger ones, without children, reach hateful old age.  How\nthen will ye live, hapless ones?  Will your oxen of their own\naccord yoke themselves for the deep plough-lands and draw the\nearth-cleaving share through the fallow, and forthwith, as the\nyear comes round, reap the harvest?  Assuredly, though the fates\ntill now have shunned me in horror, I deem that in the coming\nyear I shall put on the garment of earth, when I have received my\nmeed of burial even so as is right, before the evil days draw\nnear.  But I bid you who are younger give good heed to this.  For\nnow at your feet a way of escape lies open, if ye trust to the\nstrangers the care of your homes and all your stock and your\nglorious city.”",
        "(ll. 697-699) Thus she spake, and the assembly was filled with\nclamour.  For the word pleased them.  And after her straightway\nHypsipyle rose up again, and thus spake in reply.",
        "(ll. 700-701)  “If this purpose please you all, now will I even\nsend a messenger to the ship.”",
        "(ll. 702-707)  She spake and addressed Iphinoe close at hand:\n“Go, Iphinoe, and beg yonder man, whoever it is that leads this\narray, to come to our land that I may tell him a word that\npleases the heart of my people, and bid the men themselves, if\nthey wish, boldly enter the land and the city with friendly\nintent.”",
        "(ll. 708-711)  She spake, and dismissed the assembly, and\nthereafter started to return home.  And so Iphinoe came to the\nMinyae; and they asked with what intent she had come among them.\nAnd quickly she addressed her questioners with all speed in these\nwords:",
        "(ll. 712-716) “The maiden Hypsipyle daughter of Thoas, sent me on\nmy way here to you, to summon the captain of your ship, whoever\nhe be, that she may tell him a word that pleases the heart of the\npeople, and she bids yourselves, if ye wish it, straightway enter\nthe land and the city with friendly intent.”",
        "(ll. 717-720)  Thus she spake and the speech of good omen pleased\nall.  And they deemed that Thoas was dead and that his beloved\ndaughter Hypsipyle was queen, and quickly they sent Jason on his\nway and themselves made ready to go.",
        "(ll. 721-729)  Now he had buckled round his shoulders a purple\nmantle of double fold, the work of the Tritonian goddess, which\nPallas had given him when she first laid the keel-props of the\nship Argo and taught him how to measure timbers with the rule.\nMore easily wouldst thou cast thy eyes upon the sun at its rising\nthan behold that blazing splendour.  For indeed in the middle the\nfashion thereof was red, but at the ends it was all purple, and\non each margin many separate devices had been skilfully inwoven.",
        "(ll. 730-734)  In it were the Cyclops seated at their\nimperishable work, forging a thunderbolt for King Zeus; by now it\nwas almost finished in its brightness and still it wanted but one\nray, which they were beating out with their iron hammers as it\nspurted forth a breath of raging flame.",
        "(ll. 735-741)  In it too were the twin sons of Antiope, daughter\nof Asopus, Amphion and Zethus, and Thebe still ungirt with towers\nwas lying near, whose foundations they were just then laying in\neager haste.  Zethus on his shoulders was lifting the peak of a\nsteep mountain, like a man toiling hard, and Amphion after him,\nsinging loud and clear on his golden lyre, moved on, and a rock\ntwice as large followed his footsteps.",
        "(ll. 742-746)  Next in order had been wrought Cytherea with\ndrooping tresses, wielding the swift shield of Ares; and from her\nshoulder to her left arm the fastening of her tunic was loosed\nbeneath her breast; and opposite in the shield of bronze her\nimage appeared clear to view as she stood.",
        "(ll. 747-751)  And in it there was a well-wooded pasturage of\noxen; and about the oxen the Teleboae and the sons of Eleetryon\nwere fighting; the one party defending themselves, the others,\nthe Taphian raiders, longing to rob them; and the dewy meadow was\ndrenched with their blood, and the many were overmastering the\nfew herdsmen.",
        "(ll. 752-758)  And therein were fashioned two chariots, racing,\nand the one in front Pelops was guiding, as he shook the reins,\nand with him was Hippodameia at his side, and in pursuit Myrtilus\nurged his steeds, and with him Oenomaus had grasped his couched\nspear, but fell as the axle swerved and broke in the nave, while\nhe was eager to pierce the back of Pelops.",
        "(ll. 759-762)  And in it was wrought Phoebus Apollo, a stripling\nnot yet grown up, in the act of shooting at mighty Tityos who was\nboldly dragging his mother by her veil, Tityos whom glorious\nElate bare, but Earth nursed him and gave him second birth.",
        "(ll. 763-767)  And in it was Phrixus the Minyan as though he were\nin very deed listening to the ram, while it was like one\nspeaking.  Beholding them thou wouldst be silent and wouldst\ncheat thy soul with the hope of hearing some wise speech from\nthem, and long wouldst thou gaze with that hope.",
        "(ll. 768-773)  Such then were the gifts of the Tritonian goddess\nAthena.  And in his right hand Jason held a fardarting spear,\nwhich Atalanta gave him once as a gift of hospitality in Maenalus\nas she met him gladly; for she eagerly desired to follow on that\nquest; but he himself of his own accord prevented the maid, for\nhe feared bitter strife on account of her love.",
        "(ll. 774-792)  And he went on his way to the city like to a\nbright star, which maidens, pent up in new-built chambers, behold\nas it rises above their homes, and through the dark air it charms\ntheir eyes with its fair red gleam and the maid rejoices,\nlove-sick for the youth who is far away amid strangers, for whom\nher parents are keeping her to be his bride; like to that star\nthe hero trod the way to the city.  And when they had passed\nwithin the gates and the city, the women of the people surged\nbehind them, delighting in the stranger, but he with his eyes\nfixed on the ground fared straight on, till he reached the\nglorious palace of Hypsipyle; and when he appeared the maids\nopened the folding doors, fitted with well-fashioned panels. \nHere Iphinoe leading him quickly through a fair porch set him\nupon a shining seat opposite her mistress, but Hypsipyle turned\nher eyes aside and a blush covered her maiden cheeks, yet for all\nher modesty she addressed him with crafty words:",
        "(ll. 793-833)  “Stranger, why stay ye so long outside our towers?\nfor the city is not inhabited by the men, but they, as\nsojourners, plough the wheat-bearing fields of the Thracian\nmainland.  And I will tell out truly all our evil plight, that ye\nyourselves too may know it well.  When my father Thoas reigned\nover the citizens, then our folk starting from their homes used\nto plunder from their ships the dwellings of the Thracians who\nlive opposite, and they brought back hither measureless booty and\nmaidens too.  But the counsel of the baneful goddess Cypris was\nworking out its accomplishment, who brought upon them soul\ndestroying infatuation.  For they hated their lawful wives, and,\nyielding to their own mad folly, drove them from their homes; and\nthey took to their beds the captives of their spear, cruel ones.\nLong in truth we endured it, if haply again, though late, they\nmight change their purpose, but ever the bitter woe grew,\ntwofold.  And the lawful children were being dishonoured in their\nhalls, and a bastard race was rising.  And thus unmarried maidens\nand widowed mothers too wandered uncared for through the city; no\nfather heeded his daughter ever so little even though he should\nsee her done to death before his eyes at the hands of an insolent\nstep-dame, nor did sons, as before, defend their mother against\nunseemly outrage; nor did brothers care at heart for their\nsister.  But in their homes, in the dance, in the assembly and\nthe banquet all their thought was only for their captive maidens;\nuntil some god put desperate courage in our hearts no more to\nreceive our lords on their return from Thrace within our towers\nso that they might either heed the right or might depart and\nbegone elsewhither, they and their captives.  So they begged of\nus all the male children that were left in the city and went back\nto where even now they dwell on the snowy tilths of Thrace.  Do\nye therefore stay and settle with us; and shouldst thou desire to\ndwell here, and this finds favour with thee, assuredly thou shalt\nhave the prerogative of my father Thoas; and I deem that thou\nwilt not scorn our land at all; for it is deepsoiled beyond all\nother islands that lie in the Aegaean sea.  But come now, return\nto the ship and relate my words to thy comrades, and stay not\noutside our city.”",
        "(ll. 834-835)  She spoke, glozing over the murder that had been\nwrought upon the men; and Jason addressed her in answer:",
        "(ll. 836-841)  “Hypsipyle, very dear to our hearts is the help we\nshall meet with, which thou grantest to us who need thee.  And I\nwill return again to the city when I have told everything in\norder due.  But let the sovereignty of the island be thine; it is\nnot in scorn I yield it up, but grievous trials urge me on.”",
        "(ll. 842-852)  He spake, and touched her right hand; and quickly\nhe turned to go back: and round him the young maids on every side\ndanced in countless numbers in their joy till he passed through\nthe gates.  And then they came to the shore in smooth-running\nwains, bearing with them many gifts, when now he had related from\nbeginning to end the speech which Hypsipyle had spoken when she\nsummoned them; and the maids readily led the men back to their\nhomes for entertainment.  For Cypris stirred in them a sweet\ndesire, for the sake of Hephaestus of many counsels, in order\nthat Lemnos might be again inhabited by men and not be ruined.",
        "(ll. 853-864)  Thereupon Aeson’s son started to go to the royal\nhome of Hypsipyle; and the rest went each his way as chance took\nthem, all but Heracles; for he of his own will was left behind by\nthe ship and a few chosen comrades with him.  And straightway the\ncity rejoiced with dances and banquets, being filled with the\nsteam of sacrifice; and above all the immortals they propitiated\nwith songs and sacrifices the illustrious son of Hera and Cypris\nherself.  And the sailing was ever delayed from one day to\nanother; and long would they have lingered there, had not\nHeracles, gathering together his comrades apart from the women,\nthus addressed them with reproachful words:",
        "(ll. 865-874)  “Wretched men, does the murder of kindred keep us\nfrom our native land?  Or is it in want of marriage that we have\ncome hither from thence, in scorn of our countrywomen?  Does it\nplease us to dwell here and plough the rich soil of Lemnos?  No\nfair renown shall we win by thus tarrying so long with stranger\nwomen; nor will some god seize and give us at our prayer a fleece\nthat moves of itself.  Let us then return each to his own; but\nhim leave ye to rest all day long in the embrace of Hypsipyle\nuntil he has peopled Lemnos with men-children, and so there come\nto him great glory.”",
        "(ll. 875-887)  Thus did he chide the band; but no one dared to\nmeet his eye or to utter a word in answer.  But just as they were\nin the assembly they made ready their departure in all haste, and\nthe women came running towards them, when they knew their intent.\nAnd as when bees hum round fair lilies pouring forth from their\nhive in the rock, and all around the dewy meadow rejoices, and\nthey gather the sweet fruit, flitting from one to another; even\nso the women eagerly poured forth clustering round the men with\nloud lament, and greeted each one with hands and voice, praying\nthe blessed gods to grant him a safe return.  And so Hypsipyle\ntoo prayed, seizing the hands of Aeson’s son, and her tears\nflowed for the loss of her lover:",
        "(ll. 888-898)  “Go, and may heaven bring thee back again with thy\ncomrades unharmed, bearing to the king the golden fleece, even as\nthou wilt and thy heart desireth; and this island and my father’s\nsceptre will be awaiting thee, if on thy return hereafter thou\nshouldst choose to come hither again; and easily couldst thou\ngather a countless host of men from other cities. But thou wilt\nnot have this desire, nor do I myself forbode that so it will be. \nStill remember Hypsipyle when thou art far away and when thou\nhast returned; and leave me some word of bidding, which I will\ngladly accomplish, if haply heaven shall grant me to be a\nmother.”",
        "(ll. 899-909)  And Aeson’s son in admiration thus replied:\n“Hypsipyle, so may all these things prove propitious by the\nfavour of the blessed gods.  But do thou hold a nobler thought of\nme, since by the grace of Pelias it is enough for me to dwell in\nmy native land; may the gods only release me from my toils.  But\nif it is not my destiny to sail afar and return to the land of\nHellas, and if thou shouldst bear a male child, send him when\ngrown up to Pelasgian Iolcus, to heal the grief of my father and\nmother if so be that he find them still living, in order that,\nfar away from the king, they may be cared for by their own hearth\nin their home.”",
        "(ll. 910-921) He spake, and mounted the ship first of all; and so\nthe rest of the chiefs followed, and, sitting in order, seized\nthe oars; and Argus loosed for them the hawsers from under the\nsea-beaten rock.  Whereupon they mightily smote the water with\ntheir long oars, and in the evening by the injunctions of Orpheus\nthey touched at the island of Electra, (5) daughter of Atlas, in\norder that by gentle initiation they might learn the rites that\nmay not be uttered, and so with greater safety sail over the\nchilling sea.  Of these I will make no further mention; but I bid\nfarewell to the island itself and the indwelling deities, to whom\nbelong those mysteries, which it is not lawful for me to sing.",
        "(ll. 922-935)  Thence did they row with eagerness over the depths\nof the black Sea, having on the one side the land of the\nThracians, on the other Imbros on the south; and as the sun was\njust setting they reached the foreland of the Chersonesus.  There\na strong south wind blew for them; and raising the sails to the\nbreeze they entered the swift stream of the maiden daughter of\nAthamas; and at dawn the sea to the north was left behind and at\nnight they were coasting inside the Rhoeteian shore, with the\nland of Ida on their right.  And leaving Dardania they directed\ntheir course to Abydus, and after it they sailed past Percote and\nthe sandy beach of Abarnis and divine Pityeia.  And in that\nnight, as the ship sped on by sail and oar, they passed right\nthrough the Hellespont dark-gleaming with eddies.",
        "(ll. 936-960)  There is a lofty island inside the Propontis, a\nshort distance from the Phrygian mainland with its rich\ncornfields, sloping to the sea, where an isthmus in front of the\nmainland is flooded by the waves, so low does it lie.  And the\nisthmus has double shores, and they lie beyond the river Aesepus,\nand the inhabitants round about call the island the Mount of\nBears.  And insolent and fierce men dwell there, Earthborn, a\ngreat marvel to the neighbours to behold; for each one has six\nmighty hands to lift up, two from his sturdy shoulders, and four\nbelow, fitting close to his terrible sides.  And about the\nisthmus and the plain the Doliones had their dwelling, and over\nthem Cyzicus son of Aeneus was king, whom Aenete the daughter of\ngoodly Eusorus bare.  But these men the Earthborn monsters,\nfearful though they were, in nowise harried, owing to the\nprotection of Poseidon; for from him had the Doliones first\nsprung.  Thither Argo pressed on, driven by the winds of Thrace,\nand the Fair haven received her as she sped.  There they cast\naway their small anchorstone by the advice of Tiphys and left it\nbeneath a fountain, the fountain of Artaeie; and they took\nanother meet for their purpose, a heavy one; but the first,\naccording to the oracle of the Far-Darter, the Ionians, sons of\nNeleus, in after days laid to be a sacred stone, as was right, in\nthe temple of Jasonian Athena.",
        "(ll. 961-988)  Now the Doliones and Cyzicus himself all came\ntogether to meet them with friendliness, and when they knew of\nthe quest and their lineage welcomed them with hospitality, and\npersuaded them to row further and to fasten their ship’s hawsers\nat the city harbour.  Here they built an altar to Ecbasian Apollo\n(6) and set it up on the beach, and gave heed to sacrifices.  And\nthe king of his own bounty gave them sweet wine and sheep in\ntheir need; for he had heard a report that whenever a godlike\nband of heroes should come, straightway he should meet it with\ngentle words and should have no thought of war.  As with Jason,\nthe soft down was just blooming on his chin, nor yet had it been\nhis lot to rejoice in children, but still in his palace his wife\nwas untouched by the pangs of child-birth, the daughter of\nPercosian Merops, fair-haired Cleite, whom lately by priceless\ngifts he had brought from her father’s home from the mainland\nopposite.  But even so he left his chamber and bridal bed and\nprepared a banquet among the strangers, casting all fears from\nhis heart.  And they questioned one another in turn.  Of them\nwould he learn the end of their voyage and the injunctions of\nPelias; while they enquired about the cities of the people round\nand all the gulf of the wide Propontis; but further he could not\ntell them for all their desire to learn.  In the morning they\nclimbed mighty Dindymum that they might themselves behold the\nvarious paths of that sea; and they brought their ship from its\nformer anchorage to the harbour, Chytus; and the path they trod\nis named the path of Jason.",
        "(ll. 989-1011)  But the Earthborn men on the other side rushed\ndown from the mountain and with crags below blocked up the mouth\nof vast Chytus towards the sea, like men lying in wait for a wild\nbeast within.  But there Heracles had been left behind with the\nyounger heroes and he quickly bent his back-springing bow against\nthe monsters and brought them to earth one after another; and\nthey in their turn raised huge ragged rocks and hurled them.  For\nthese dread monsters too, I ween, the goddess Hera, bride of\nZeus, had nurtured to be a trial for Heracles.  And therewithal\ncame the rest of the martial heroes returning to meet the foe\nbefore they reached the height of outlook, and they fell to the\nslaughter of the Earthborn, receiving them with arrows and spears\nuntil they slew them all as they rushed fiercely to battle.  And\nas when woodcutters cast in rows upon the beach long trees just\nhewn down by their axes, in order that, once sodden with brine,\nthey may receive the strong bolts; so these monsters at the\nentrance of the foam-fringed harbour lay stretched one after\nanother, some in heaps bending their heads and breasts into the\nsalt waves with their limbs spread out above on the land; others\nagain were resting their heads on the sand of the shore and their\nfeet in the deep water, both alike a prey to birds and fishes at\nonce.",
        "(ll. 1012-1076)  But the heroes, when the contest was ended\nwithout fear, loosed the ship’s hawsers to the breath of the wind\nand pressed on through the sea-swell.  And the ship sped on under\nsail all day; but when night came the rushing wind did not hold\nsteadfast, but contrary blasts caught them and held them back\ntill they again approached the hospitable Doliones.  And they\nstepped ashore that same night; and the rock is still called the\nSacred Rock round which they threw the ship’s hawsers in their\nhaste.  Nor did anyone note with care that it was the same\nisland; nor in the night did the Doliones clearly perceive that\nthe heroes were returning; but they deemed that Pelasgian war-men\nof the Macrians had landed.  Therefore they donned their armour\nand raised their hands against them.  And with clashing of ashen\nspears and shields they fell on each other, like the swift rush\nof fire which falls on dry brushwood and rears its crest; and the\ndin of battle, terrible and furious, fell upon the people of the\nDoliones.  Nor was the king to escape his fate and return home\nfrom battle to his bridal chamber and bed.  But Aeson’s son leapt\nupon him as he turned to face him, and smote him in the middle of\nthe breast, and the bone was shattered round the spear; he rolled\nforward in the sand and filled up the measure of his fate.  For\nthat no mortal may escape; but on every side a wide snare\nencompasses us.  And so, when he thought that he had escaped\nbitter death from the chiefs, fate entangled him that very night\nin her toils while battling with them; and many champions withal\nwere slain; Heracles killed Telecles and Megabrontes, and Acastus\nslew Sphodris; and Peleus slew Zelus and Gephyrus swift in war.\nTelamon of the strong spear slew Basileus.  And Idas slew\nPromeus, and Clytius Hyacinthus, and the two sons of Tyndareus\nslew Megalossaces and Phlogius.  And after them the son of Oeneus\nslew bold Itomeneus, and Artaceus, leader of men; all of whom the\ninhabitants still honour with the worship due to heroes.  And the\nrest gave way and fled in terror just as doves fly in terror\nbefore swift-winged hawks.  And with a din they rustled in a body\nto the gates; and quickly the city was filled with loud cries at\nthe turning of the dolorous fight.  But at dawn both sides\nperceived the fatal and cureless error; and bitter grief seized\nthe Minyan heroes when they saw before them Cyzicus son of Aeneus\nfallen in the midst of dust and blood.  And for three whole days\nthey lamented and rent their hair, they and the Dollones.  Then\nthree times round his tomb they paced in armour of bronze and\nperformed funeral rites and celebrated games, as was meet, upon\nthe meadow-plain, where even now rises the mound of his grave to\nbe seen by men of a later day.  No, nor was his bride Cleite left\nbehind her dead husband, but to crown the ill she wrought an ill\nyet more awful, when she clasped a noose round her neck.  Her\ndeath even the nymphs of the grove bewailed; and of all the tears\nfor her that they shed to earth from their eyes the goddesses\nmade a fountain, which they call Cleite, (7) the illustrious name\nof the hapless maid.  Most terrible came that day from Zeus upon\nthe Doliones, women and men; for no one of them dared even to\ntaste food, nor for a long time by reason of grief did they take\nthought for the toil of the cornmill, but they dragged on their\nlives eating their food as it was, untouched by fire.  Here even\nnow, when the Ionians that dwell in Cyzicus pour their yearly\nlibations for the dead, they ever grind the meal for the\nsacrificial cakes at the common mill. (8)",
        "(ll. 1079-1091)  After this, fierce tempests arose for twelve\ndays and nights together and kept them there from sailing.  But\nin the next night the rest of the chieftains, overcome by sleep,\nwere resting during the latest period of the night, while Acastus\nand Mopsus the son of Ampyeus kept guard over their deep\nslumbers.  And above the golden head of Aeson’s son there hovered\na halcyon prophesying with shrill voice the ceasing of the stormy\nwinds; and Mopsus heard and understood the cry of the bird of the\nshore, fraught with good omen.  And some god made it turn aside,\nand flying aloft it settled upon the stern-ornament of the ship.\nAnd the seer touched Jason as he lay wrapped in soft sheepskins\nand woke him at once, and thus spake:",
        "(ll. 1092-1102)  “Son of Aeson, thou must climb to this temple on\nrugged Dindymum and propitiate the mother (9) of all the blessed\ngods on her fair throne, and the stormy blasts shall cease.  For\nsuch was the voice I heard but now from the halcyon, bird of the\nsea, which, as it flew above thee in thy slumber, told me all. \nFor by her power the winds and the sea and all the earth below\nand the snowy seat of Olympus are complete; and to her, when from\nthe mountains she ascends the mighty heaven, Zeus himself, the\nson of Cronos, gives place.  In like manner the rest of the\nimmortal blessed ones reverence the dread goddess.”",
        "(ll. 1103-1152)  Thus he spake, and his words were welcome to\nJason’s ear.  And he arose from his bed with joy and woke all his\ncomrades hurriedly and told them the prophecy of Mopsus the son\nof Ampycus.  And quickly the younger men drove oxen from their\nstalls and began to lead them to the mountain’s lofty summit. \nAnd they loosed the hawsers from the sacred rock and rowed to the\nThracian harbour; and the heroes climbed the mountain, leaving a\nfew of their comrades in the ship.  And to them the Macrian\nheights and all the coast of Thrace opposite appeared to view\nclose at hand.  And there appeared the misty mouth of Bosporus\nand the Mysian hills; and on the other side the stream of the\nriver Aesepus and the city and Nepeian plain of Adrasteia.  Now\nthere was a sturdy stump of vine that grew in the forest, a tree\nexceeding old; this they cut down, to be the sacred image of the\nmountain goddess; and Argus smoothed it skilfully, and they set\nit upon that rugged hill beneath a canopy of lofty oaks, which of\nall trees have their roots deepest.  And near it they heaped an\naltar of small stones, and wreathed their brows with oak leaves\nand paid heed to sacrifice, invoking the mother of Dindymum, most\nvenerable, dweller in Phrygia, and Titias and Cyllenus, who alone\nof many are called dispensers of doom and assessors of the Idaean\nmother,–the Idaean Dactyls of Crete, whom once the nymph\nAnchiale, as she grasped with both hands the land of Oaxus, bare\nin the Dictaean cave.  And with many prayers did Aeson’s son\nbeseech the goddess to turn aside the stormy blasts as he poured\nlibations on the blazing sacrifice; and at the same time by\ncommand of Orpheus the youths trod a measure dancing in full\narmour, and clashed with their swords on their shields, so that\nthe ill-omened cry might be lost in the air the wail which the\npeople were still sending up in grief for their king.  Hence from\nthat time forward the Phrygians propitiate Rhea with the wheel\nand the drum.  And the gracious goddess, I ween, inclined her\nheart to pious sacrifices; and favourable signs appeared.  The\ntrees shed abundant fruit, and round their feet the earth of its\nown accord put forth flowers from the tender grass.  And the\nbeasts of the wild wood left their lairs and thickets and came up\nfawning on them with their tails.  And she caused yet another\nmarvel; for hitherto there was no flow of water on Dindymum, but\nthen for them an unceasing stream gushed forth from the thirsty\npeak just as it was, and the dwellers around in after times\ncalled that stream, the spring of Jason.  And then they made a\nfeast in honour of the goddess on the Mount of Bears, singing the\npraises of Rhea most venerable; but at dawn the winds had ceased\nand they rowed away from the island.",
        "(ll. 1153-1171)  Thereupon a spirit of contention stirred each\nchieftain, who should be the last to leave his oar.  For all\naround the windless air smoothed the swirling waves and lulled\nthe sea to rest.  And they, trusting in the calm, mightily drove\nthe ship forward; and as she sped through the salt sea, not even\nthe storm-footed steeds of Poseidon would have overtaken her. \nNevertheless when the sea was stirred by violent blasts which\nwere just rising from the rivers about evening, forspent with\ntoil, they ceased.  But Heracles by the might of his arms pulled\nthe weary rowers along all together, and made the strong-knit\ntimbers of the ship to quiver.  But when, eager to reach the\nMysian mainland, they passed along in sight of the mouth of\nRhyndaeus and the great cairn of Aegaeon, a little way from\nPhrygia, then Heracles, as he ploughed up the furrows of the\nroughened surge, broke his oar in the middle.  And one half he\nheld in both his hands as he fell sideways, the other the sea\nswept away with its receding wave.  And he sat up in silence\nglaring round; for his hands were unaccustomed to he idle.",
        "(ll. 1172-1186)  Now at the hour when from the field some delver\nor ploughman goes gladly home to his hut, longing for his evening\nmeal, and there on the threshold, all squalid with dust, bows his\nwearied knees, and, beholding his hands worn with toil, with many\na curse reviles his belly; at that hour the heroes reached the\nhomes of the Cianian land near the Arganthonian mount and the\noutfall of Cius.  Them as they came in friendliness, the Mysians,\ninhabitants of that land, hospitably welcomed, and gave them in\ntheir need provisions and sheep and abundant wine.  Hereupon some\nbrought dried wood, others from the meadows leaves for beds which\nthey gathered in abundance for strewing, whilst others were\ntwirling sticks to get fire; others again were mixing wine in the\nbowl and making ready the feast, after sacrificing at nightfall\nto Apollo Ecbasius.",
        "(ll. 1187-1206)  But the son of Zeus having duly enjoined on his\ncomrades to prepare the feast took his way into a wood, that he\nmight first fashion for himself an oar to fit his hand. \nWandering about he found a pine not burdened with many branches,\nnor too full of leaves, but like to the shaft of a tall poplar;\nso great was it both in length and thickness to look at.  And\nquickly he laid on the ground his arrow-holding quiver together\nwith his bow, and took off his lion’s skin.  And he loosened the\npine from the ground with his bronze-tipped club and grasped the\ntrunk with both hands at the bottom, relying on his strength; and\nhe pressed it against his broad shoulder with legs wide apart;\nand clinging close he raised it from the ground deep-rooted\nthough it was, together with clods of earth.  And as when\nunexpectedly, just at the time of the stormy setting of baleful\nOrion, a swift gust of wind strikes down from above, and wrenches\na ship’s mast from its stays, wedges and all; so did Heracles\nlift the pine.  And at the same time he took up his bow and\narrows, his lion skin and club, and started on his return.",
        "(ll. 1207-1239)  Meantime Hylas with pitcher of bronze in hand\nhad gone apart from the throng, seeking the sacred flow of a\nfountain, that he might be quick in drawing water for the evening\nmeal and actively make all things ready in due order against his\nlord’s return.  For in such ways did Heracles nurture him from\nhis first childhood when he had carried him off from the house of\nhis father, goodly Theiodamas, whom the hero pitilessly slew\namong the Dryopians because he withstood him about an ox for the\nplough.  Theiodamas was cleaving with his plough the soil of\nfallow land when he was smitten with the curse; and Heracles bade\nhim give up the ploughing ox against his will.  For he desired to\nfind some pretext for war against the Dryopians for their bane,\nsince they dwelt there reckless of right.  But these tales would\nlead me far astray from my song.  And quickly Hylas came to the\nspring which the people who dwell thereabouts call Pegae.  And\nthe dances of the nymphs were just now being held there; for it\nwas the care of all the nymphs that haunted that lovely headland\never to hymn Artemis in songs by night.  All who held the\nmountain peaks or glens, all they were ranged far off guarding\nthe woods; but one, a water-nymph was just rising from the\nfair-flowing spring; and the boy she perceived close at hand with\nthe rosy flush of his beauty and sweet grace.  For the full moon\nbeaming from the sky smote him.  And Cypris made her heart faint,\nand in her confusion she could scarcely gather her spirit back to\nher.  But as soon as he dipped the pitcher in the stream, leaning\nto one side, and the brimming water rang loud as it poured\nagainst the sounding bronze, straightway she laid her left arm\nabove upon his neck yearning to kiss his tender mouth; and with\nher right hand she drew down his elbow, and plunged him into the\nmidst of the eddy.",
        "(ll. 1240-1256)  Alone of his comrades the hero Polyphemus, son\nof Eilatus, as he went forward on the path, heard the boy’s cry,\nfor he expected the return of mighty Heracles.  And he rushed\nafter the cry, near Pegae, like some beast of the wild wood whom\nthe bleating of sheep has reached from afar, and burning with\nhunger he follows, but does not fall in with the flocks; for the\nshepherds beforehand have penned them in the fold, but he groans\nand roars vehemently until he is weary.  Thus vehemently at that\ntime did the son of Eilatus groan and wandered shouting round the\nspot; and his voice rang piteous.  Then quickly drawing his great\nsword he started in pursuit, in fear lest the boy should be the\nprey of wild beasts, or men should have lain in ambush for him\nfaring all alone, and be carrying him off, an easy prey. \nHereupon as he brandished his bare sword in his hand he met\nHeracles himself on the path, and well he knew him as he hastened\nto the ship through the darkness.  And straightway he told the\nwretched calamity while his heart laboured with his panting\nbreath.",
        "(ll. 1257-1260)  “My poor friend, I shall be the first to bring\nthee tidings of bitter woe.  Hylas has gone to the well and has\nnot returned safe, but robbers have attacked and are carrying him\noff, or beasts are tearing him to pieces; I heard his cry.”",
        "(ll. 1261-1272)  Thus he spake; and when Heracles heard his\nwords, sweat in abundance poured down from his temples and the\nblack blood boiled beneath his heart.  And in wrath he hurled the\npine to the ground and hurried along the path whither his feet\nbore on his impetuous soul.  And as when a bull stung by a gadfly\ntears along, leaving the meadows and the marsh land, and recks\nnot of herdsmen or herd, but presses on, now without cheek, now\nstanding still, and raising his broad neck he bellows loudly,\nstung by the maddening fly; so he in his frenzy now would ply his\nswift knees unresting, now again would cease from toil and shout\nafar with loud pealing cry.",
        "(ll. 1273-1289)  But straightway the morning star rose above the\ntopmost peaks and the breeze swept down; and quickly did Tiphys\nurge them to go aboard and avail themselves of the wind.  And\nthey embarked eagerly forthwith; and they drew up the ship’s\nanchors and hauled the ropes astern.  And the sails were bellied\nout by the wind, and far from the coast were they joyfully borne\npast the Posideian headland.  But at the hour when gladsome dawn\nshines from heaven, rising from the east, and the paths stand out\nclearly, and the dewy plains shine with a bright gleam, then at\nlength they were aware that unwittingly they had abandoned those\nmen.  And a fierce quarrel fell upon them, and violent tumult,\nfor that they had sailed and left behind the bravest of their\ncomrades.  And Aeson’s son, bewildered by their hapless plight,\nsaid never a word, good or bad; but sat with his heavy load of\ngrief, eating out his heart.  And wrath seized Telamon, and thus\nhe spake:",
        "(ll. 1290-1295)  “Sit there at thy ease, for it was fitting for\nthee to leave Heracles behind; from thee the project arose, so\nthat his glory throughout Hellas should not overshadow thee, if\nso be that heaven grants us a return home.  But what pleasure is\nthere in words?  For I will go, I only, with none of thy\ncomrades, who have helped thee to plan this treachery.”",
        "(ll. 1296-1314)  He spake, and rushed upon Tiphys son of Hagnias;\nand his eyes sparkled like flashes of ravening flame.  And they\nwould quickly have turned back to the land of the Mysians,\nforcing their way through the deep sea and the unceasing blasts\nof the wind, had not the two sons of Thracian Boreas held back\nthe son of Aeacus with harsh words.  Hapless ones, assuredly a\nbitter vengeance came upon them thereafter at the hands of\nHeracles, because they stayed the search for him.  For when they\nwere returning from the games over Pelias dead he slew them in\nsea-girt Tenos and heaped the earth round them, and placed two\ncolumns above, one of which, a great marvel for men to see, moves\nat the breath of the blustering north wind.  These things were\nthus to be accomplished in after times.  But to them appeared\nGlaucus from the depths of the sea, the wise interpreter of\ndivine Nereus, and raising aloft his shaggy head and chest from\nhis waist below, with sturdy hand he seized the ship’s keel, and\nthen cried to the eager crew:",
        "(ll. 1315-1325)  “Why against the counsel of mighty Zeus do ye\npurpose to lead bold Heracles to the city of Aeetes?  At Argos it\nis his fate to labour for insolent Eurystheus and to accomplish\nfull twelve toils and dwell with the immortals, if so be that he\nbring to fulfilment a few more yet; wherefore let there be no\nvain regret for him.  Likewise it is destined for Polyphemus to\nfound a glorious city at the mouth of Cius among the Mysians and\nto fill up the measure of his fate in the vast land of the\nChalybes.  But a goddess-nymph through love has made Hylas her\nhusband, on whose account those two wandered and were left\nbehind.”",
        "(ll. 1326-1331)  He spake, and with a plunge wrapped him about\nwith the restless wave; and round him the dark water foamed in\nseething eddies and dashed against the hollow ship as it moved\nthrough the sea.  And the heroes rejoiced, and Telamon son of\nAeacus came in haste to Jason, and grasping his hand in his own\nembraced him with these words:",
        "(ll. 1332-1335)  “Son of Aeson, be not wroth with me, if in my\nfolly I have erred, for grief wrought upon me to utter a word\narrogant and intolerable.  But let me give my fault to the winds\nand let our hearts be joined as before.”",
        "(ll. 1336-1343)  Him the son of Aeson with prudence addressed:\n“Good friend, assuredly with an evil word didst thou revile me,\nsaying before them all that I was the wronger of a kindly man.\nBut not for long will I nurse bitter wrath, though indeed before\nI was grieved.  For it was not for flocks of sheep, no, nor for\npossessions that thou wast angered to fury, but for a man, thy\ncomrade.  And I were fain thou wouldst even champion me against\nanother man if a like thing should ever befall me.”",
        "(ll. 1344-1357)  He spake, and they sat down, united as of old.\nBut of those two, by the counsel of Zeus, one, Polyphemus son of\nEilatus, was destined to found and build a city among the Mysians\nbearing the river’s name, and the other, Heracles, to return and\ntoil at the labours of Eurystheus.  And he threatened to lay\nwaste the Mysian land at once, should they not discover for him\nthe doom of Hylas, whether living or dead.  And for him they gave\npledges choosing out the noblest sons of the people and took an\noath that they would never cease from their labour of search.\nTherefore to this day the people of Cius enquire for Hylas the\nson of Theiodamas, and take thought for the well-built Trachis.\nFor there did Heracles settle the youths whom they sent from Cius\nas pledges.",
        "(ll. 1358-1362)  And all day long and all night the wind bore the\nship on, blowing fresh and strong; but when dawn rose there was\nnot even a breath of air.  And they marked a beach jutting forth\nfrom a bend of the coast, very broad to behold, and by dint of\nrowing came to land at sunrise.",
        "ENDNOTES:\n(1)  i.e. God of embarcation.\n(2)  Or, reading EKTOTHEN, “they strongly girded the ship outside\n     with a well-twisted rope.”  In either case there is probably\n     no allusion to YPOZOMATA (ropes for undergirding) which were\n     carried loose and only used in stormy weather.\n(3)  i.e. God of the shore.\n(4)  i.e. The Starting.\n(5)  Samothrace.\n(6)  i.e. god of disembarcation.\n(7)  Cleite means illustrious.\n(8)  i.e. to avoid grinding it at home.\n(9)  Rhea.",
