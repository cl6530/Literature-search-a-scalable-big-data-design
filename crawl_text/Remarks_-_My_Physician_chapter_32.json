        "[An Open Letter.]",
        "Dear Sir: I have seen recently an open letter addressed to me, and written\nby you in a vein of confidence and strictly sub rosa. What you said was so\nstrictly confidential, in fact, that you published the letter in New York,\nand it was copied through the press of the country. I shall, therefore,\nendeavor to be equally careful in writing my reply.",
        "You refer in your kind and confidential note to your experience as an\ninvalid, and your rapid recovery after the use of red-hot Mexican pepper\ntea in a molten state.",
        "But you did not have such a physician as I did when I had spinal\nmeningitis. He was a good doctor for horses and blind staggers, but he was\nout of his sphere when he strove to fool with the human frame. Change of\nscene and rest were favorite prescriptions of his. Most of his patients\ngot both, especially eternal rest. He made a specialty of eternal rest.",
        "He did not know what the matter was with me, but he seemed to be willing\nto learn.",
        "My wife says that while he was attending me I was as crazy as a loon, but\nthat I was more lucid than the physician. Even with my little, shattered\nwreck of mind, tottering between a superficial knowledge of how to pound\nsand and a wide, shoreless sea of mental vacuity, I still had the edge on\nmy physician, from an intellectual point of view. He is still practicing\nmedicine in a quiet kind of way, weary of life, and yet fearing to die and\ngo where his patients are.",
        "He had a sabre wound on one cheek that gave him a ferocious appearance. He\nfrequently alluded to how he used to mix up in the carnage of battle, and\nhow he used to roll up his pantaloons and wade in gore. He said that if\nthe tocsin of war should sound even now, or if he were to wake up in the\nnight and hear war’s rude alarum, he would spring to arms and make tyranny\ntremble till its suspender buttons fell off.",
        "Oh, he was a bad man from Bitter Creek.",
        "One day I learned from an old neighbor that this physician did not have\nanything to do with preserving the Union intact, but that he acquired the\nscar on his cheek while making some experiments as a drunk and disorderly.\nHe would come and sit by my bedside for hours, waiting for this mortality\nto put on immortality, so that he could collect his bill from the estate,\nbut one day I arose during a temporary delirium, and extracting a slat\nfrom my couch I smote him across the pit of the stomach with it, while I\nhissed through my clenched teeth:",
        "“Physician, heal thyself.”",
        "I then tottered a few minutes, and fell back into the arms of my\nattendants. If you do not believe this, I can still show you the clenched\nteeth. Also the attendants.",
        "I had a hard time with this physician, but I still live, contrary to his\nearnest solicitations.",
        "I desire to state that should this letter creep into the press of the\ncountry, and thus become in a measure public, I hope that it will create\nno ill-feeling on your part.",
        "Our folks are all well as I write, and should you happen to be on Lake\nSuperior this winter, yachting, I hope you will drop in and see us. Our\nlatch string is hanging out most all the time, and if you will pound on\nthe fence I will call off the dog.",
        "I frequently buy a copy of your paper on the streets. Do you get the\nmoney?",
        "Are you acquainted with the staff of The Century, published in New York?\nI was in The Century office several hours last spring, and the editors\ntreated me very handsomely, but, although I have bought the magazine ever\nsince, and read it thoroughly, I have not seen yet where they said that\n“they had a pleasant call from the genial and urbane William Nye.” I do\nnot feel offended over this. I simply feel hurt.",
        "Before that I had a good notion to write a brief epic on the “Warty Toad,\"\nand send it to The Century for publication, but now it is quite\ndoubtful.",
        "The Century may be a good paper, but it does not take the press\ndispatches, and only last month I saw in it an account of a battle that to\nmy certain knowledge occurred twenty years ago.",
