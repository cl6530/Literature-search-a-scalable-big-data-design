        "Squire Davenport was a thoroughly respectable man in the estimation of\nthe community.  That such a man was capable of defrauding a poor\nwidow, counting on her ignorance, would have plunged all his friends\nand acquaintances into the profoundest amazement.",
        "Yet this was precisely what the squire had done.",
        "Mr. Barclay, who had prospered beyond his wife’s knowledge, found\nhimself seven years before in possession of a thousand dollars in hard\ncash.  Knowing that the squire had a better knowledge of suitable\ninvestments than he, he went to him one day and asked advice.  Now,\nthe squire was fond of money.  When he saw the ample roll of bank\nnotes which his neighbor took from his wallet, he felt a desire to\npossess them.  They would not be his, to be sure, but merely to have\nthem under his control seemed pleasant.  So he said:",
        "“Friend Barclay, I should need time to consider that question.  Are\nyou in a hurry?”",
        "“I should like to get the money out of my possession.  I might lose it\nor have it stolen.  Besides, I don’t want my wife to discover that I\nhave it.”",
        "“It might make her extravagant, perhaps,” suggested the squire.",
        "“No, I am not afraid of that; but I want some day to surprise her by\nletting her see that I am a richer man than she thinks.”",
        "“Very judicious!  Then no one knows that you have the money?”",
        "“No one; I keep my business to myself.”",
        "“You are a wise man.  I’ll tell you what I will do, friend Barclay.\nWhile I am not prepared to recommend any particular investment, I will\ntake the money and give you my note for it, agreeing to pay six per\ncent. interest.  Of course I shall invest it in some way, and I may\ngain or I may lose, but even if I do lose you will be safe, for you\nwill have my note, and will receive interest semi-annually.”",
        "The proposal struck Mr. Barclay quite favorably.",
        "“I suppose I can have the money when I want it again?” he inquired.",
        "“Oh, certainly!  I may require a month’s notice to realize on\nsecurities; but if I have the money in bank I won’t even ask that.”",
        "“Then take the money, squire, and give me the note.”",
        "So, in less than five minutes, the money found its way into Squire\nDavenport’s strong box, and Mr. Barclay left the squire’s presence\nwell satisfied with his note of hand in place of his roll of\ngreenbacks.",
        "Nearly two years passed.  Interest was paid punctually three times,\nand another payment was all but due when the unfortunate creditor died\nin Chicago.  Then it was that a terrible temptation assailed Squire\nDavenport.  No one knew of the trust his neighbor had reposed in\nhim–not even his wife.  Of course, if the note was found in his\npocket, all would be known.  But perhaps it would not be known.  In\nthat case, the thousand dollars and thirty dollars interest might be\nretained without anyone being the wiser.",
        "It is only fair to say that Squire Davenport’s face flushed with shame\nas the unworthy thought came to him, but still he did not banish it.\nHe thought the matter over, and the more he thought the more unwilling\nhe was to give up this sum, which all at once had become dearer to him\nthan all the rest of his possessions.",
        "“I’ll wait to see whether the note is found,” he said to himself.  “Of\ncourse, if it is, I will pay it–” That is, he would pay it if he\nwere obliged to do it.",
        "Poor Barclay was buried in Chicago–it would have been too expensive\nto bring on the body–and pretty soon it transpired that he had left\nno property, except the modest cottage in which his widow and son\ncontinued to live.",
        "Poor Mrs. Barclay!  Everybody pitied her, and lamented her straitened\ncircumstances.  Squire Davenport kept silence, and thought, with\nguilty joy, “They haven’t found the note; I can keep the money, and no\none will be the wiser!”",
        "How a rich man could have been guilty of such consummate meaness I\nwill not undertake to explain, but “the love of money is the root of\nevil,” and Squire Davenport had love of money in no common measure.",
        "Five years passed.  Mrs. Barclay was obliged to mortgage her house to\nobtain the means of living, and the very man who supplied her with the\nmoney was the very man whom her husband had blindly trusted.  She\nlittle dreamed that it was her own money he was doling out to her.",
        "In fact, Squire Davenport himself had almost forgotten it.  He had\ncome to consider the thousand dollars and interest fully and\nabsolutely his own, and had no apprehension that his mean fraud would\never be discovered.  Like a thunderbolt, then, came to him the\ndeclaration of his unsavory visitor that the note was in existence,\nand was in the hands of a man who meant to use it.  Smitten with\nsudden panic, he stared in the face of the tramp.  But he was not\ngoing to give up without a struggle.",
        "“You are evidently trying to impose upon me,” he said, mentally\nbracing up.  “You wish to extort money from me.”",
        "“So I do,” said the tramp quietly.",
        "“Ha!  you admit it?” exclaimed the squire.",
        "“Certainly; I wouldn’t have taken the trouble to come here at great\nexpense and inconvenience if I hadn’t been expecting to make some\nmoney.”",
        "“Then you have come to the wrong person; I repeat it, you’ve come to\nthe wrong person!” said the squire, straightening his back and eying\nhis companion sternly.",
        "“I begin to think I have,” assented the visitor.",
        "“Ha!  he weakens!” thought Squire Davenport.  “My good man, I\nrecommend you to turn over a new leaf, and seek to earn an honest\nliving, instead of trying to levy blackmail on men of means.”",
        "“An honest living!”  repeated the tramp, with a laugh.  “This advice\ncomes well from you.”",
        "Once more the squire felt uncomfortable and apprehensive.",
        "“I don’t understand you,” he said irritably.  “However, as you\nyourself admit, you have come to the wrong person.”",
        "“Just so,” said the visitor, rising.  “I now go to the right person.”",
        "“What do you mean?” asked Squire Davenport, in alarm.",
        "“I mean that I ought to have gone to Mrs. Barclay.”",
        "“Sit down, sit down!” said the squire nervously.  “You mustn’t do\nthat.”",
        "“Why not?” demanded the tramp, looking him calmly in the face.",
        "“Because it would disturb her mind, and excite erroneous thoughts and\nexpectations.”",
        "“She would probably be willing to give me a good sum for bringing it\nto her, say, the overdue interest.  That alone, in five years and a\nhalf, would amount to over three hundred dollars, even without\ncompounding.”",
        "Squire Davenport groaned in spirit.  It was indeed true!  He must pay\naway over thirteen hundred dollars, and his loss in reputation would\nbe even greater than his loss of money.",
        "“Can’t we compromise this thing?” he stammered.  “I don’t admit the\ngenuineness of the note, but if such a claim were made, it would\nseriously annoy me.  I am willing to give you, say, fifty dollars, if\nyou will deliver up the pretended note.”",
        "“It won’t do, squire.  Fifty dollars won’t do!  I won’t take a cent\nless than two hundred, and that is only about half the interest you\nwould have to pay.”",
        "“You speak as if the note were genuine,” said the squire\nuncomfortably.",
        "“You know whether it is or not,” said the tramp significantly.  “At\nany rate, we won’t talk about that.  You know my terms.”",
        "In the end Squire Davenport paid over two hundred dollars, and\nreceived back the note, which after a hasty examination, he threw into\nthe fire.",
        "“Now,” he said roughly, “get out of my house, you–forger.”",
        "“Good-evening, squire,” said the tramp, laughing and nodding to the\ndiscomfited squire.  “We may meet again, some time.”",
        "“If you come here again, I will set the dog on you.”",
        "“So much the worse for the dog!  Well, good-night!  I have enjoyed my\ninterview–hope you have.”",
        "“Impudent scoundrel!” said the squire to himself.  “I hope he will\nswing some day!”",
        "But, as he thought over what had happened, he found comfort in the\nthought that the secret was at last safe.  The note was burned, and\ncould never reappear in judgment against him.  Certainly, he got off\ncheap.",
        "“Well,” thought the tramp as he strode away from the squire’s mansion,\n“this has been a profitable evening.  I have two hundred dollars in my\npocket, and–I still have a hold on the rascal.  If he had only\nexamined the note before burning it, he might have made a discovery!”",
