        "Concerning their cutting of their hair, their care of their teeth,\nand shaving of their beard",
        "The men and women cut their hair close round to the ears and eyes.\nThe women, after the manner of the Parthians, cover their heads\nwith a large white veil, folded together in the form of a crown.",
        "Both sexes exceed any other nation in attention to their teeth,\nwhich they render like ivory, by constantly rubbing them with green\nhazel and wiping with a woollen cloth.  For their better\npreservation, they abstain from hot meats, and eat only such as are\ncold, warm, or temperate.  The men shave all their beard except the\nmoustaches (GERNOBODA).  This custom is not recent, but was\nobserved in ancient and remote ages, as we find in the works of\nJulius Caesar, who says, (21) “The Britons shave every part of\ntheir body except their head and upper lip;” and to render\nthemselves more active, and avoid the fate of Absalon in their\nexcursions through the woods, they are accustomed to cut even the\nhair from their heads; so that this nation more than any other\nshaves off all pilosity.  Julius also adds, that the Britons,\nprevious to an engagement, anointed their faces with a nitrous\nointment, which gave them so ghastly and shining an appearance,\nthat the enemy could scarcely bear to look at them, particularly if\nthe rays of the sun were reflected on them.",
