        "Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom\nthe Bennets were particularly intimate.  Sir William Lucas\nhad been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a\ntolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an\naddress to the king during his mayoralty.  The distinction had\nperhaps been felt too strongly.  It had given him a disgust\nto his business, and to his residence in a small market town;\nand, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family\nto a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that\nperiod Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his\nown importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself\nsolely in being civil to all the world.  For, though elated by his\nrank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was\nall attention to everybody.  By nature inoffensive, friendly, and\nobliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him courteous.",
        "Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to\nbe a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.  They had several\nchildren.  The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young\nwoman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.",
        "That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to\ntalk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after\nthe assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\ncommunicate.",
        "“_You began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with\ncivil self-command to Miss Lucas.  ’You were Mr. Bingley’s\nfirst choice.”",
        "“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”",
        "“Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her\ntwice.  To be sure that did seem as if he admired her–indeed\nI rather believe he did–I heard something about it–but I\nhardly know what–something about Mr. Robinson.”",
        "“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;\ndid not I mention it to you?  Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he\nliked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there\nwere a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought\nthe prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last\nquestion: ’Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there\ncannot be two opinions on that point.’”",
        "“Upon my word!  Well, that is very decided indeed–that does\nseem as if–but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”",
        "“_My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,\"\nsaid Charlotte.  “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to\nas his friend, is he?–poor Eliza!–to be only just tolerable.”",
        "“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by\nhis ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it\nwould be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.  Mrs. Long\ntold me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour\nwithout once opening his lips.”",
        "“Are you quite sure, ma’am?–is not there a little mistake?\"\nsaid Jane.  “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”",
        "“Aye–because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield,\nand he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed\nquite angry at being spoke to.”",
        "“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,\nunless among his intimate acquaintances.  With them he is\nremarkably agreeable.”",
        "“I do not believe a word of it, my dear.  If he had been so very\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.  But I can guess\nhow it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I\ndare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep\na carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”",
        "“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas,\n“but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”",
        "“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance\nwith him, if I were you.”",
        "“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you never to dance\nwith him.”",
        "“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend me so much as\npride often does, because there is an excuse for it.  One cannot\nwonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\neverything in his favour, should think highly of himself.  If I\nmay so express it, he has a right to be proud.”",
        "“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily\nforgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.”",
        "“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity\nof her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe.  By\nall that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\nindeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and\nthat there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\nself-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real\nor imaginary.  Vanity and pride are different things, though\nthe words are often used synonymously.  A person may be proud\nwithout being vain.  Pride relates more to our opinion of\nourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”",
        "“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who\ncame with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was.  I\nwould keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a\nday.”",
        "“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said\nMrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\nyour bottle directly.”",
        "The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\nthat she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.",
