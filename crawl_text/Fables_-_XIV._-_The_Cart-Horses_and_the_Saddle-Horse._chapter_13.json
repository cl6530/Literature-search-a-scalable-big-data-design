        "Two cart-horses, a gelding and a mare, were brought to Samoa, and \nput in the same field with a saddle-horse to run free on the \nisland.  They were rather afraid to go near him, for they saw he \nwas a saddle-horse, and supposed he would not speak to them.  Now \nthe saddle-horse had never seen creatures so big.  “These must be \ngreat chiefs,” thought he, and he approached them civilly.  “Lady \nand gentleman,” said he, “I understand you are from the colonies.  \nI offer you my affectionate compliments, and make you heartily \nwelcome to the islands.”",
        "The colonials looked at him askance, and consulted with each other.",
        "“Who can he be?” said the gelding.",
        "“He seems suspiciously civil,” said the mare.",
        "“I do not think he can be much account,” said the gelding.",
        "“Depend upon it he is only a Kanaka,” said the mare.",
        "Then they turned to him.",
        "“Go to the devil!” said the gelding.",
        "“I wonder at your impudence, speaking to persons of our quality!” \ncried the mare.",
