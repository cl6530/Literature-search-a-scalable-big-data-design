        "But it was not Delphine; it was Therese, her waiting-woman, who stood\nin the doorway.",
        "“Monsieur Eugene,” she said, “monsieur and madame have had a terrible\nscene about some money that Madame (poor thing!) wanted for her\nfather. She fainted, and the doctor came, and she had to be bled,\ncalling out all the while, ’My father is dying; I want to see papa!’\nIt was heartbreaking to hear her––”",
        "“That will do, Therese. If she came now, it would be trouble thrown\naway. M. Goriot cannot recognize any one now.”",
        "“Poor, dear gentleman, is he as bad at that?” said Therese.",
        "“You don’t want me now, I must go and look after my dinner; it is\nhalf-past four,” remarked Sylvie. The next instant she all but\ncollided with Mme. de Restaud on the landing outside.",
        "There was something awful and appalling in the sudden apparition of\nthe Countess. She saw the bed of death by the dim light of the single\ncandle, and her tears flowed at the sight of her father’s passive\nfeatures, from which the life had almost ebbed. Bianchon with\nthoughtful tact left the room.",
        "“I could not escape soon enough,” she said to Rastignac.",
        "The student bowed sadly in reply. Mme. de Restaud took her father’s\nhand and kissed it.",
        "“Forgive me, father! You used to say that my voice would call you back\nfrom the grave; ah! come back for one moment to bless your penitent\ndaughter. Do you hear me? Oh! this is fearful! No one on earth will\never bless me henceforth; every one hates me; no one loves me but you\nin all the world. My own children will hate me. Take me with you,\nfather; I will love you, I will take care of you. He does not hear me\n. . . I am mad . . .”",
        "She fell on her knees, and gazed wildly at the human wreck before her.",
        "“My cup of misery is full,” she said, turning her eyes upon Eugene.\n“M. de Trailles has fled, leaving enormous debts behind him, and I\nhave found out that he was deceiving me. My husband will never forgive\nme, and I have left my fortune in his hands. I have lost all my\nillusions. Alas! I have forsaken the one heart that loved me (she\npointed to her father as she spoke), and for whom? I have held his\nkindness cheap, and slighted his affection; many and many a time I\nhave given him pain, ungrateful wretch that I am!”",
        "“He knew it,” said Rastignac.",
        "Just then Goriot’s eyelids unclosed; it was only a muscular\ncontraction, but the Countess’ sudden start of reviving hope was no\nless dreadful than the dying eyes.",
        "“Is it possible that he can hear me?” cried the Countess. “No,” she\nanswered herself, and sat down beside the bed. As Mme. de Restaud\nseemed to wish to sit by her father, Eugene went down to take a little\nfood. The boarders were already assembled.",
        "“Well,” remarked the painter, as he joined them, “it seems that there\nis to be a death-orama upstairs.”",
        "“Charles, I think you might find something less painful to joke\nabout,” said Eugene.",
        "“So we may not laugh here?” returned the painter. “What harm does it\ndo? Bianchon said that the old man was quite insensible.”",
        "“Well, then,” said the employe from the Museum, “he will die as he\nhas lived.”",
        "“My father is dead!” shrieked the Countess.",
        "The terrible cry brought Sylvie, Rastignac, and Bianchon; Mme. de\nRestaud had fainted away. When she recovered they carried her\ndownstairs, and put her into the cab that stood waiting at the door.\nEugene sent Therese with her, and bade the maid take the Countess to\nMme. de Nucingen.",
        "Bianchon came down to them.",
        "“Yes, he is dead,” he said.",
        "“Come, sit down to dinner, gentlemen,” said Mme. Vauquer, “or the soup\nwill be cold.”",
        "The two students sat down together.",
        "“What is the next thing to be done?” Eugene asked of Bianchon.",
        "“I have closed his eyes and composed his limbs,” said Bianchon. “When\nthe certificate has been officially registered at the Mayor’s office,\nwe will sew him in his winding sheet and bury him somewhere. What do\nyou think we ought to do?”",
        "“He will not smell at his bread like this any more,” said the painter,\nmimicking the old man’s little trick.",
        "“Oh, hang it all!” cried the tutor, “let Father Goriot drop, and let\nus have something else for a change. He is a standing dish, and we\nhave had him with every sauce this hour or more. It is one of the\nprivileges of the good city of Paris that anybody may be born, or\nlive, or die there without attracting any attention whatsoever. Let us\nprofit by the advantages of civilization. There are fifty or sixty\ndeaths every day; if you have a mind to do it, you can sit down at any\ntime and wail over whole hecatombs of dead in Paris. Father Goriot has\ngone off the hooks, has he? So much the better for him. If you\nvenerate his memory, keep it to yourselves, and let the rest of us\nfeed in peace.”",
        "“Oh, to be sure,” said the widow, “it is all the better for him that\nhe is dead. It looks as though he had had trouble enough, poor soul,\nwhile he was alive.”",
        "And this was all the funeral oration delivered over him who had been\nfor Eugene the type and embodiment of Fatherhood.",
        "The fifteen lodgers began to talk as usual. When Bianchon and Eugene\nhad satisfied their hunger, the rattle of spoons and forks, the\nboisterous conversation, the expressions on the faces that bespoke\nvarious degrees of want of feeling, gluttony, or indifference,\neverything about them made them shiver with loathing. They went out to\nfind a priest to watch that night with the dead. It was necessary to\nmeasure their last pious cares by the scanty sum of money that\nremained. Before nine o’clock that evening the body was laid out on\nthe bare sacking of the bedstead in the desolate room; a lighted\ncandle stood on either side, and the priest watched at the foot.\nRastignac made inquiries of this latter as to the expenses of the\nfuneral, and wrote to the Baron de Nucingen and the Comte de Restaud,\nentreating both gentlemen to authorize their man of business to defray\nthe charges of laying their father-in-law in the grave. He sent\nChristophe with the letters; then he went to bed, tired out, and\nslept.",
        "Next day Bianchon and Rastignac were obliged to take the certificate\nto the registrar themselves, and by twelve o’clock the formalities\nwere completed. Two hours went by, no word came from the Count nor\nfrom the Baron; nobody appeared to act for them, and Rastignac had\nalready been obliged to pay the priest. Sylvie asked ten francs for\nsewing the old man in his winding-sheet and making him ready for the\ngrave, and Eugene and Bianchon calculated that they had scarcely\nsufficient to pay for the funeral, if nothing was forthcoming from the\ndead man’s family. So it was the medical student who laid him in a\npauper’s coffin, despatched from Bianchon’s hospital, whence he\nobtained it at a cheaper rate.",
        "“Let us play those wretches a trick,” said he. “Go to the cemetery,\nbuy a grave for five years at Pere-Lachaise, and arrange with the\nChurch and the undertaker to have a third-class funeral. If the\ndaughters and their husbands decline to repay you, you can carve this\non the headstone–’Here lies M. Goriot, father of the Comtesse de\nRestaud and the Baronne de Nucingen, interred at the expense of two\nstudents.’”",
        "Eugene took part of his friend’s advice, but only after he had gone in\nperson first to M. and Mme. de Nucingen, and then to M. and Mme. de\nRestaud–a fruitless errand. He went no further than the doorstep in\neither house. The servants had received strict orders to admit no one.",
        "“Monsieur and Madame can see no visitors. They have just lost their\nfather, and are in deep grief over their loss.”",
        "Eugene’s Parisian experience told him that it was idle to press the\npoint. Something clutched strangely at his heart when he saw that it\nwas impossible to reach Delphine.",
        "“Sell some of your ornaments,” he wrote hastily in the porter’s room,\n“so that your father may be decently laid in his last resting-place.”",
        "He sealed the note, and begged the porter to give it to Therese for\nher mistress; but the man took it to the Baron de Nucingen, who flung\nthe note into the fire. Eugene, having finished his errands, returned\nto the lodging-house about three o’clock. In spite of himself, the\ntears came into his eyes. The coffin, in its scanty covering of black\ncloth, was standing there on the pavement before the gate, on two\nchairs. A withered sprig of hyssop was soaking in the holy water bowl\nof silver-plated copper; there was not a soul in the street, not a\npasser-by had stopped to sprinkle the coffin; there was not even an\nattempt at a black drapery over the wicket. It was a pauper who lay\nthere; no one made a pretence of mourning for him; he had neither\nfriends nor kindred–there was no one to follow him to the grave.",
        "Bianchon’s duties compelled him to be at the hospital, but he had left\na few lines for Eugene, telling his friend about the arrangements he\nhad made for the burial service. The house student’s note told\nRastignac that a mass was beyond their means, that the ordinary office\nfor the dead was cheaper, and must suffice, and that he had sent word\nto the undertaker by Christophe. Eugene had scarcely finished reading\nBianchon’s scrawl, when he looked up and saw the little circular gold\nlocket that contained the hair of Goriot’s two daughters in Mme.\nVauquer’s hands.",
        "“How dared you take it?” he asked.",
        "“Good Lord! is that to be buried along with him?” retorted Sylvie. “It\nis gold.”",
        "“Of course it shall!” Eugene answered indignantly; “he shall at any\nrate take one thing that may represent his daughters into the grave\nwith him.”",
        "When the hearse came, Eugene had the coffin carried into the house\nagain, unscrewed the lid, and reverently laid on the old man’s breast\nthe token that recalled the days when Delphine and Anastasie were\ninnocent little maidens, before they began “to think for themselves,\"\nas he had moaned out in his agony.",
        "Rastignac and Christophe and the two undertaker’s men were the only\nfollowers of the funeral. The Church of Saint-Etienne du Mont was only\na little distance from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. When the coffin\nhad been deposited in a low, dark, little chapel, the law student\nlooked round in vain for Goriot’s two daughters or their husbands.\nChristophe was his only fellow-mourner; Christophe, who appeared to\nthink it was his duty to attend the funeral of the man who had put him\nin the way of such handsome tips. As they waited there in the chapel\nfor the two priests, the chorister, and the beadle, Rastignac grasped\nChristophe’s hand. He could not utter a word just then.",
        "“Yes, Monsieur Eugene,” said Christophe, “he was a good and worthy\nman, who never said one word louder than another; he never did any one\nany harm, and gave nobody any trouble.”",
        "The two priests, the chorister, and the beadle came, and said and did\nas much as could be expected for seventy francs in an age when\nreligion cannot afford to say prayers for nothing.",
        "The ecclesiatics chanted a psalm, the Libera nos and the De\nprofundis. The whole service lasted about twenty minutes. There was\nbut one mourning coach, which the priest and chorister agreed to share\nwith Eugene and Christophe.",
        "“There is no one else to follow us,” remarked the priest, “so we\nmay as well go quickly, and so save time; it is half-past five.”",
        "But just as the coffin was put in the hearse, two empty carriages,\nwith the armorial bearings of the Comte de Restaud and the Baron de\nNucingen, arrived and followed in the procession to Pere-Lachaise. At\nsix o’clock Goriot’s coffin was lowered into the grave, his daughters’\nservants standing round the while. The ecclesiastic recited the short\nprayer that the students could afford to pay for, and then both priest\nand lackeys disappeared at once. The two grave diggers flung in\nseveral spadefuls of earth, and then stopped and asked Rastignac for\ntheir fee. Eugene felt in vain in his pocket, and was obliged to\nborrow five francs of Christophe. This thing, so trifling in itself,\ngave Rastignac a terrible pang of distress. It was growing dusk, the\ndamp twilight fretted his nerves; he gazed down into the grave and the\ntears he shed were drawn from him by the sacred emotion, a\nsingle-hearted sorrow. When such tears fall on earth, their radiance\nreaches heaven. And with that tear that fell on Father Goriot’s grave,\nEugene Rastignac’s youth ended. He folded his arms and gazed at the\nclouded sky; and Christophe, after a glance at him, turned and went\n–Rastignac was left alone.",
        "He went a few paces further, to the highest point of the cemetery, and\nlooked out over Paris and the windings of the Seine; the lamps were\nbeginning to shine on either side of the river. His eyes turned almost\neagerly to the space between the column of the Place Vendome and the\ncupola of the Invalides; there lay the shining world that he had\nwished to reach. He glanced over that humming hive, seeming to draw a\nforetaste of its honey, and said magniloquently:",
        "“Henceforth there is war between us.”",
        "And by way of throwing down the glove to Society, Rastignac went to\ndine with Mme. de Nucingen.",
