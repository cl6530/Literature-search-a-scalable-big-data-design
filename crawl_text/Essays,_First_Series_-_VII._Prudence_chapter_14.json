        "What right have I to write on Prudence, whereof I have\nLittle, and that of the negative sort? My prudence\nconsists in avoiding and going without, not in the\ninventing of means and methods, not in adroit steering,\nnot in gentle repairing. I have no skill to make money\nspend well, no genius in my economy, and whoever sees\nmy garden discovers that I must have some other garden.\nYet I love facts, and hate lubricity and people without\nperception. Then I have the same title to write on prudence\nthat I have to write on poetry or holiness. We write from\naspiration and antagonism, as well as from experience. We\npaint those qualities which we do not possess. The poet\nadmires the man of energy and tactics; the merchant breeds\nhis son for the church or the bar; and where a man is not\nvain and egotistic you shall find what he has not by his\npraise. Moreover it would be hardly honest in me not to\nbalance these fine lyric words of Love and Friendship with\nwords of coarser sound, and whilst my debt to my senses is\nreal and constant, not to own it in passing.",
        "Prudence is the virtue of the senses. It is the science\nof appearances. It is the outmost action of the inward\nlife. It is God taking thought for oxen. It moves matter\nafter the laws of matter. It is content to seek health\nof body by complying with physical conditions, and health\nof mind by the laws of the intellect.",
        "The world of the senses is a world of shows; it does not\nexist for itself, but has a symbolic character; and a true\nprudence or law of shows recognizes the co-presence of other\nlaws and knows that its own office is subaltern; knows that\nit is surface and not centre where it works. Prudence is\nfalse when detached. It is legitimate when it is the Natural\nHistory of the soul incarnate, when it unfolds the beauty\nof laws within the narrow scope of the senses.",
        "There are all degrees of proficiency in knowledge of the\nworld. It is sufficient to our present purpose to indicate\nthree. One class live to the utility of the symbol,\nesteeming health and wealth a final good.  Another class\nlive above this mark to the beauty of the symbol, as the\npoet and artist and the naturalist and man of science. A\nthird class live above the beauty of the symbol to the\nbeauty of the thing signified; these are wise men. The\nfirst class have common sense; the second, taste; and the\nthird, spiritual perception. Once in a long time, a man\ntraverses the whole scale, and sees and enjoys the symbol\nsolidly, then also has a clear eye for its beauty, and\nlastly, whilst he pitches his tent on this sacred volcanic\nisle of nature, does not offer to build houses and barns\nthereon,—reverencing the splendor of the God which he\nsees bursting through each chink and cranny.",
        "The world is filled with the proverbs and acts and\nwinkings of a base prudence, which is a devotion to\nmatter, as if we possessed no other faculties than\nthe palate, the nose, the touch, the eye and ear; a\nprudence which adores the Rule of Three, which never\nsubscribes, which never gives, which seldom lends,\nand asks but one question of any project,—Will it\nbake bread? This is a disease like a thickening of\nthe skin until the vital organs are destroyed. But\nculture, revealing the high origin of the apparent\nworld and aiming at the perfection of the man as the\nend, degrades every thing else, as health and bodily\nlife, into means. It sees prudence not to be a several\nfaculty, but a name for wisdom and virtue conversing\nwith the body and its wants. Cultivated men always feel\nand speak so, as if a great fortune, the achievement of\na civil or social measure, great personal influence, a\ngraceful and commanding address, had their value as\nproofs of the energy of the spirit. If a man lose his\nbalance and immerse himself in any trades or pleasures\nfor their own sake, he may be a good wheel or pin, but\nhe is not a cultivated man.",
        "The spurious prudence, making the senses final, is the\ngod of sots and cowards, and is the subject of all\ncomedy. It is nature’s joke, and therefore literature’s.\nThe true prudence limits this sensualism by admitting\nthe knowledge of an internal and real world. This\nrecognition once made, the order of the world and the\ndistribution of affairs and times, being studied with\nthe co-perception of their subordinate place, will\nreward any degree of attention. For our existence, thus\napparently attached in nature to the sun and the returning\nmoon and the periods which they mark,—so susceptible to\nclimate and to country, so alive to social good and evil,\nso fond of splendor and so tender to hunger and cold and\ndebt,—reads all its primary lessons out of these books.",
        "Prudence does not go behind nature and ask whence it is.\nIt takes the laws of the world whereby man’s being is\nconditioned, as they are, and keeps these laws that it\nmay enjoy their proper good. It respects space and time,\nclimate, want, sleep, the law of polarity, growth and\ndeath. There revolve, to give bound and period to his\nbeing on all sides, the sun and moon, the great formalists\nin the sky: here lies stubborn matter, and will not swerve\nfrom its chemical routine. Here is a planted globe, pierced\nand belted with natural laws and fenced and distributed\nexternally with civil partitions and properties which impose\nnew restraints on the young inhabitant.",
        "We eat of the bread which grows in the field. We live by\nthe air which blows around us and we are poisoned by the\nair that is too cold or too hot, too dry or too wet. Time,\nwhich shows so vacant, indivisible and divine in its coming,\nis slit and peddled into trifles and tatters. A door is to\nbe painted, a lock to be repaired. I want wood or oil, or\nmeal or salt; the house smokes, or I have a headache; then\nthe tax, and an affair to be transacted with a man without\nheart or brains, and the stinging recollection of an\ninjurious or very awkward word,—these eat up the hours.\nDo what we can, summer will have its flies; if we walk in\nthe woods we must feed mosquitos; if we go a-fishing we\nmust expect a wet coat.  Then climate is a great impediment\nto idle persons; we often resolve to give up the care of the\nweather, but still we regard the clouds and the rain.",
        "We are instructed by these petty experiences which usurp\nthe hours and years. The hard soil and four months of\nsnow make the inhabitant of the northern temperate zone\nwiser and abler than his fellow who enjoys the fixed\nsmile of the tropics. The islander may ramble all day\nat will. At night he may sleep on a mat under the moon,\nand wherever a wild date-tree grows, nature has, without\na prayer even, spread a table for his morning meal. The\nnortherner is perforce a householder. He must brew, bake,\nsalt and preserve his food, and pile wood and coal. But\nas it happens that not one stroke can labor lay to without\nsome new acquaintance with nature, and as nature is\ninexhaustibly significant, the inhabitants of these\nclimates have always excelled the southerner in force.\nSuch is the value of these matters that a man who knows\nother things can never know too much of these. Let him\nhave accurate perceptions. Let him, if he have hands,\nhandle; if eyes, measure and discriminate; let him accept\nand hive every fact of chemistry, natural history and\neconomics; the more he has, the less is he willing to\nspare any one. Time is always bringing the occasions that\ndisclose their value. Some wisdom comes out of every\nnatural and innocent action. The domestic man, who loves\nno music so well as his kitchen clock and the airs which\nthe logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth, has\nsolaces which others never dream of. The application of\nmeans to ends insures victory and the songs of victory not\nless in a farm or a shop than in the tactics of party or\nof war. The good husband finds method as efficient in the\npacking of fire-wood in a shed or in the harvesting of\nfruits in the cellar, as in Peninsular campaigns or the\nfiles of the Department of State. In the rainy day he\nbuilds a work-bench, or gets his tool-box set in the corner\nof the barn-chamber, and stored with nails, gimlet, pincers,\nscrewdriver and chisel. Herein he tastes an old joy of youth\nand childhood, the cat-like love of garrets, presses and\ncorn-chambers, and of the conveniences of long housekeeping.\nHis garden or his poultry-yard tells him many pleasant\nanecdotes. One might find argument for optimism in the\nabundant flow of this saccharine element of pleasure in\nevery suburb and extremity of the good world. Let a man\nkeep the law,—any law,—and his way will be strown with\nsatisfactions. There is more difference in the quality of\nour pleasures than in the amount.",
        "On the other hand, nature punishes any neglect of prudence.\nIf you think the senses final, obey their law.  If you\nbelieve in the soul, do not clutch at sensual sweetness\nbefore it is ripe on the slow tree of cause and effect.\nIt is vinegar to the eyes to deal with men of loose and\nimperfect perception. Dr. Johnson is reported to have said,\n—\"If the child says he looked out of this window, when he\nlooked out of that,—whip him.” Our American character is\nmarked by a more than average delight in accurate perception,\nwhich is shown by the currency of the byword, “No mistake.\"\nBut the discomfort of unpunctuality, of confusion of thought\nabout facts, of inattention to the wants of to-morrow, is\nof no nation. The beautiful laws of time and space, once\ndislocated by our inaptitude, are holes and dens. If the\nhive be disturbed by rash and stupid hands, instead of honey\nit will yield us bees. Our words and actions to be fair must\nbe timely. A gay and pleasant sound is the whetting of the\nscythe in the mornings of June, yet what is more lonesome\nand sad than the sound of a whetstone or mower’s rifle when\nit is too late in the season to make hay? Scatter-brained\nand “afternoon” men spoil much more than their own affair\nin spoiling the temper of those who deal with them. I have\nseen a criticism on some paintings, of which I am reminded\nwhen I see the shiftless and unhappy men who are not true\nto their senses. The last Grand Duke of Weimar, a man of\nsuperior understanding, said,—\"I have sometimes remarked\nin the presence of great works of art, and just now\nespecially in Dresden, how much a certain property\ncontributes to the effect which gives life to the figures,\nand to the life an irresistible truth. This property is\nthe hitting, in all the figures we draw, the right centre\nof gravity. I mean the placing the figures firm upon their\nfeet, making the hands grasp, and fastening the eyes on\nthe spot where they should look. Even lifeless figures, as\nvessels and stools—let them be drawn ever so correctly—\nlose all effect so soon as they lack the resting upon their\ncentre of gravity, and have a certain swimming and oscillating\nappearance. The Raphael in the Dresden gallery (the only\ngreatly affecting picture which I have seen) is the quietest\nand most passionless piece you can imagine; a couple of saints\nwho worship the Virgin and Child.  Nevertheless, it awakens a\ndeeper impression than the contortions of ten crucified\nmartyrs. For beside all the resistless beauty of form, it\npossesses in the highest degree the property of the\nperpendicularity of all the figures.” This perpendicularity\nwe demand of all the figures in this picture of life. Let\nthem stand on their feet, and not float and swing. Let us\nknow where to find them. Let them discriminate between what\nthey remember and what they dreamed, call a spade a spade,\ngive us facts, and honor their own senses with trust.",
        "But what man shall dare tax another with imprudence?\nWho is prudent? The men we call greatest are least in\nthis kingdom. There is a certain fatal dislocation in\nour relation to nature, distorting our modes of living\nand making every law our enemy, which seems at last to\nhave aroused all the wit and virtue in the world to\nponder the question of Reform. We must call the highest\nprudence to counsel, and ask why health and beauty and\ngenius should now be the exception rather than the rule\nof human nature? We do not know the properties of plants\nand animals and the laws of nature, through our sympathy\nwith the same; but this remains the dream of poets. Poetry\nand prudence should be coincident. Poets should be\nlawgivers; that is, the boldest lyric inspiration should\nnot chide and insult, but should announce and lead the\ncivil code and the day’s work. But now the two things seem\nirreconcilably parted. We have violated law upon law until\nwe stand amidst ruins, and when by chance we espy a\ncoincidence between reason and the phenomena, we are\nsurprised. Beauty should be the dowry of every man and\nwoman, as invariably as sensation; but it is rare. Health\nor sound organization should be universal. Genius should\nbe the child of genius and every child should be inspired;\nbut now it is not to be predicted of any child, and nowhere\nis it pure. We call partial half-lights, by courtesy,\ngenius; talent which converts itself to money; talent which\nglitters to-day that it may dine and sleep well to-morrow;\nand society is officered by men of parts, as they are properly\ncalled, and not by divine men. These use their gifts to refine\nluxury, not to abolish it. Genius is always ascetic, and piety,\nand love. Appetite shows to the finer souls as a disease, and\nthey find beauty in rites and bounds that resist it.",
        "We have found out fine names to cover our sensuality\nwithal, but no gifts can raise intemperance. The man\nof talent affects to call his transgressions of the\nlaws of the senses trivial and to count them nothing\nconsidered with his devotion to his art. His art never\ntaught him lewdness, nor the love of wine, nor the\nwish to reap where he had not sowed. His art is less\nfor every deduction from his holiness, and less for\nevery defect of common sense. On him who scorned the\nworld as he said, the scorned world wreaks its revenge.\nHe that despiseth small things will perish by little\nand little. Goethe’s Tasso is very likely to be a\npretty fair historical portrait, and that is true\ntragedy. It does not seem to me so genuine grief when\nsome tyrannous Richard the Third oppresses and slays a\nscore of innocent persons, as when Antonio and Tasso,\nboth apparently right, wrong each other. One living\nafter the maxims of this world and consistent and true\nto them, the other fired with all divine sentiments,\nyet grasping also at the pleasures of sense, without\nsubmitting to their law. That is a grief we all feel,\na knot we cannot untie. Tasso’s is no infrequent case\nin modern biography. A man of genius, of an ardent\ntemperament, reckless of physical laws, self-indulgent,\nbecomes presently unfortunate, querulous, a “discomfortable\ncousin,” a thorn to himself and to others.",
        "The scholar shames us by his bifold life. Whilst\nsomething higher than prudence is active, he is\nadmirable; when common sense is wanted, he is an\nencumbrance. Yesterday, Caesar was not so great;\nto-day, the felon at the gallows’ foot is not more\nmiserable. Yesterday, radiant with the light of an\nideal world in which he lives, the first of men; and\nnow oppressed by wants and by sickness, for which he\nmust thank himself. He resembles the pitiful drivellers\nwhom travellers describe as frequenting the bazaars of\nConstantinople, who skulk about all day, yellow,\nemaciated, ragged, sneaking; and at evening, when the\nbazaars are open, slink to the opium-shop, swallow their\nmorsel and become tranquil and glorified seers. And who\nhas not seen the tragedy of imprudent genius struggling\nfor years with paltry pecuniary difficulties, at last\nsinking, chilled, exhausted and fruitless, like a giant\nslaughtered by pins?",
        "Is it not better that a man should accept the first\npains and mortifications of this sort, which nature\nis not slack in sending him, as hints that he must\nexpect no other good than the just fruit of his own\nlabor and self-denial? Health, bread, climate, social\nposition, have their importance, and he will give them\ntheir due.  Let him esteem Nature a perpetual counsellor,\nand her perfections the exact measure of our deviations.\nLet him make the night night, and the day day. Let him\ncontrol the habit of expense. Let him see that as much\nwisdom may be expended on a private economy as on an\nempire, and as much wisdom may be drawn from it. The\nlaws of the world are written out for him on every\npiece of money in his hand. There is nothing he will\nnot be the better for knowing, were it only the wisdom\nof Poor Richard, or the State-Street prudence of buying\nby the acre to sell by the foot; or the thrift of the\nagriculturist, to stick a tree between whiles, because\nit will grow whilst he sleeps; or the prudence which\nconsists in husbanding little strokes of the tool,\nlittle portions of time, particles of stock and small\ngains. The eye of prudence may never shut. Iron, if kept\nat the ironmonger’s, will rust; beer, if not brewed in\nthe right state of the atmosphere, will sour; timber of\nships will rot at sea, or if laid up high and dry, will\nstrain, warp and dry-rot; money, if kept by us, yields\nno rent and is liable to loss; if invested, is liable to\ndepreciation of the particular kind of stock. Strike,\nsays the smith, the iron is white; keep the rake, says\nthe haymaker, as nigh the scythe as you can, and the cart\nas nigh the rake. Our Yankee trade is reputed to be very\nmuch on the extreme of this prudence. It takes bank-notes,\ngood, bad, clean, ragged, and saves itself by the speed\nwith which it passes them off. Iron cannot rust, nor beer\nsour, nor timber rot, nor calicoes go out of fashion, nor\nmoney stocks depreciate, in the few swift moments in which\nthe Yankee suffers any one of them to remain in his\npossession. In skating over thin ice our safety is in our\nspeed.",
        "Let him learn a prudence of a higher strain. Let him\nlearn that every thing in nature, even motes and\nfeathers, go by law and not by luck, and that what he\nsows he reaps. By diligence and self-command let him\nput the bread he eats at his own disposal, that he may\nnot stand in bitter and false relations to other men;\nfor the best good of wealth is freedom. Let him practise\nthe minor virtues. How much of human life is lost in\nwaiting! let him not make his fellow-creatures wait. How\nmany words and promises are promises of conversation!\nLet his be words of fate. When he sees a folded and sealed\nscrap of paper float round the globe in a pine ship and\ncome safe to the eye for which it was written, amidst a\nswarming population, let him likewise feel the admonition\nto integrate his being across all these distracting forces,\nand keep a slender human word among the storms, distances\nand accidents that drive us hither and thither, and, by\npersistency, make the paltry force of one man reappear to\nredeem its pledge after months and years in the most distant\nclimates.",
        "We must not try to write the laws of any one virtue,\nlooking at that only. Human nature loves no contradictions,\nbut is symmetrical. The prudence which secures an outward\nwell-being is not to be studied by one set of men, whilst\nheroism and holiness are studied by another, but they are\nreconcilable.  Prudence concerns the present time, persons,\nproperty and existing forms. But as every fact hath its\nroots in the soul, and if the soul were changed, would cease\nto be, or would become some other thing,—the proper\nadministration of outward things will always rest on a just\napprehension of their cause and origin; that is, the good\nman will be the wise man, and the single-hearted the politic\nman. Every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide\nin the liar, but is a stab at the health of human society.\nOn the most profitable lie the course of events presently\nlays a destructive tax; whilst frankness invites frankness,\nputs the parties on a convenient footing and makes their\nbusiness a friendship. Trust men and they will be true to\nyou; treat them greatly and they will show themselves great,\nthough they make an exception in your favor to all their\nrules of trade.",
        "So, in regard to disagreeable and formidable things,\nprudence does not consist in evasion or in flight, but\nin courage. He who wishes to walk in the most peaceful\nparts of life with any serenity must screw himself up\nto resolution. Let him front the object of his worst\napprehension, and his stoutness will commonly make his\nfear groundless. The Latin proverb says, “In battles the\neye is first overcome.”  Entire self-possession may make\na battle very little more dangerous to life than a match\nat foils or at football. Examples are cited by soldiers\nof men who have seen the cannon pointed and the fire given\nto it, and who have stepped aside from the path of the ball.\nThe terrors of the storm are chiefly confined to the parlor\nand the cabin. The drover, the sailor, buffets it all day,\nand his health renews itself at as vigorous a pulse under\nthe sleet as under the sun of June.",
        "In the occurrence of unpleasant things among neighbors,\nfear comes readily to heart and magnifies the consequence\nof the other party; but it is a bad counsellor. Every man\nis actually weak and apparently strong. To himself he\nseems weak; to others, formidable. You are afraid of Grim;\nbut Grim also is afraid of you. You are solicitous of the\ngood-will of the meanest person, uneasy at his ill-will.\nBut the sturdiest offender of your peace and of the\nneighborhood, if you rip up his claims, is as thin and\ntimid as any, and the peace of society is often kept,\nbecause, as children say, one is afraid, and the other\ndares not. Far off, men swell, bully and threaten; bring\nthem hand to hand, and they are a feeble folk.",
        "It is a proverb that ’courtesy costs nothing’; but\ncalculation might come to value love for its profit.\nLove is fabled to be blind, but kindness is necessary\nto perception; love is not a hood, but an eye-water.\nIf you meet a sectary or a hostile partisan, never\nrecognize the dividing lines, but meet on what common\nground remains,—if only that the sun shines and the\nrain rains for both; the area will widen very fast,\nand ere you know it, the boundary mountains on which\nthe eye had fastened have melted into air. If they\nset out to contend, Saint Paul will lie and Saint John\nwill hate. What low, poor, paltry, hypocritical people\nan argument on religion will make of the pure and chosen\nsouls! They will shuffle and crow, crook and hide, feign\nto confess here, only that they may brag and conquer\nthere, and not a thought has enriched either party, and\nnot an emotion of bravery, modesty, or hope. So neither\nshould you put yourself in a false position with your\ncontemporaries by indulging a vein of hostility and\nbitterness.  Though your views are in straight antagonism\nto theirs, assume an identity of sentiment, assume that\nyou are saying precisely that which all think, and in the\nflow of wit and love roll out your paradoxes in solid\ncolumn, with not the infirmity of a doubt. So at least\nshall you get an adequate deliverance. The natural motions\nof the soul are so much better than the voluntary ones that\nyou will never do yourself justice in dispute. The thought\nis not then taken hold of by the right handle, does not show\nitself proportioned and in its true bearings, but bears\nextorted, hoarse, and half witness. But assume a consent and\nit shall presently be granted, since really and underneath\ntheir external diversities, all men are of one heart and\nmind.",
        "Wisdom will never let us stand with any man or men on\nan unfriendly footing. We refuse sympathy and intimacy\nwith people, as if we waited for some better sympathy\nand intimacy to come. But whence and when? To-morrow\nwill be like to-day. Life wastes itself whilst we are\npreparing to live. Our friends and fellow-workers die\noff from us. Scarcely can we say we see new men, new\nwomen, approaching us.  We are too old to regard fashion,\ntoo old to expect patronage of any greater or more powerful.\nLet us suck the sweetness of those affections and consuetudes\nthat grow near us. These old shoes are easy to the feet.\nUndoubtedly we can easily pick faults in our company, can\neasily whisper names prouder, and that tickle the fancy more.\nEvery man’s imagination hath its friends; and life would be\ndearer with such companions. But if you cannot have them on\ngood mutual terms, you cannot have them. If not the Deity\nbut our ambition hews and shapes the new relations, their\nvirtue escapes, as strawberries lose their flavor in garden-beds.",
        "Thus truth, frankness, courage, love, humility and all\nthe virtues range themselves on the side of prudence,\nor the art of securing a present well-being. I do not\nknow if all matter will be found to be made of one\nelement, as oxygen or hydrogen, at last, but the world\nof manners and actions is wrought of one stuff, and\nbegin where we will we are pretty sure in a short space\nto be mumbling our ten commandments.",
