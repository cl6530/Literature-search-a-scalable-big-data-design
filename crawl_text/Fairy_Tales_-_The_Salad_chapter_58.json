        "As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood,\nthere came up a little old woman, and said to him, ’Good day, good\nday; you seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give\nme something to eat.’ The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand\nin his pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way;\nbut she took hold of him, and said, ’Listen, my friend, to what I am\ngoing to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way,\nand after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see\nnine birds sitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one\nwill fall down dead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a\nwishing-cloak, and when you wear it you will find yourself at any\nplace where you may wish to be. Cut open the dead bird, take out its\nheart and keep it, and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow\nevery morning when you rise. It is the bird’s heart that will bring\nyou this good luck.’",
        "The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ’If all this does\nhappen, it will be a fine thing for me.’ When he had gone a hundred\nsteps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over\nhim, and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their\nbills and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if\neach wished to have it himself. ’Well,’ said the huntsman, ’this is\nwonderful; this happens just as the old woman said’; then he shot into\nthe midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the\nflock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.\nThen the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird,\ntook out the heart, and carried the cloak home with him.",
        "The next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay\nthe piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day,\nand indeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold,\nand at last thought to himself, ’Of what use is this gold to me whilst\nI am at home? I will go out into the world and look about me.’",
        "Then he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his\nneck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led\nthrough a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a\ngreen meadow, and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very\nbeautiful young lady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman\nwas a witch, and said to the young lady, ’There is a young man coming\nout of the wood who carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away\nfrom him, my dear child, for it is more fit for us than for him. He\nhas a bird’s heart that brings a piece of gold under his pillow every\nmorning.’ Meantime the huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady,\nand said to himself, ’I have been travelling so long that I should\nlike to go into this castle and rest myself, for I have money enough\nto pay for anything I want’; but the real reason was, that he wanted\nto see more of the beautiful lady. Then he went into the house, and\nwas welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love\nthat he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady’s eyes, and\ndoing everything that she wished. Then the old woman said, ’Now is the\ntime for getting the bird’s heart.’ So the lady stole it away, and he\nnever found any more gold under his pillow, for it lay now under the\nyoung lady’s, and the old woman took it away every morning; but he was\nso much in love that he never missed his prize.",
        "’Well,’ said the old witch, ’we have got the bird’s heart, but not the\nwishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.’ ’Let us leave him\nthat,’ said the young lady; ’he has already lost his wealth.’ Then the\nwitch was very angry, and said, ’Such a cloak is a very rare and\nwonderful thing, and I must and will have it.’ So she did as the old\nwoman told her, and set herself at the window, and looked about the\ncountry and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, ’What makes\nyou so sad?’ ’Alas! dear sir,’ said she, ’yonder lies the granite rock\nwhere all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there,\nthat whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can\nreach it? only the birds and the flies–man cannot.’ ’If that’s all\nyour grief,’ said the huntsman, ’I’ll take there with all my heart’;\nso he drew her under his cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the\ngranite mountain they were both there. The diamonds glittered so on\nall sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the\nfinest. But the old witch made a deep sleep come upon him, and he said\nto the young lady, ’Let us sit down and rest ourselves a little, I am\nso tired that I cannot stand any longer.’ So they sat down, and he\nlaid his head in her lap and fell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping\non she took the cloak from his shoulders, hung it on her own, picked\nup the diamonds, and wished herself home again.",
        "When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him\nalone on the wild rock, he said, ’Alas! what roguery there is in the\nworld!’ and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to\ndo. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as\nhe saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, ’I can\nonly save myself by feigning to be asleep’; so he laid himself down as\nif he were in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first\npushed him with his foot, and said, ’What worm is this that lies here\ncurled up?’ ’Tread upon him and kill him,’ said the second. ’It’s not\nworth the trouble,’ said the third; ’let him live, he’ll go climbing\nhigher up the mountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him\naway.’ And they passed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said;\nand as soon as they were gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain,\nand when he had sat there a short time a cloud came rolling around\nhim, and caught him in a whirlwind and bore him along for some time,\ntill it settled in a garden, and he fell quite gently to the ground\namongst the greens and cabbages.",
        "Then he looked around him, and said, ’I wish I had something to eat,\nif not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples\nnor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.’ At last he\nthought to himself, ’I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen\nme.’ So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he\nswallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with\nhorror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very\nhungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to\nanother kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt\nanother change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to\nhave found his old shape again.",
        "Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and\nwhen he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good\nand the bad salad, and thought to himself, ’This will help me to my\nfortune again, and enable me to pay off some folks for their\ntreachery.’ So he went away to try and find the castle of his friends;\nand after wandering about a few days he luckily found it. Then he\nstained his face all over brown, so that even his mother would not\nhave known him, and went into the castle and asked for a lodging; ’I\nam so tired,’ said he, ’that I can go no farther.’ ’Countryman,’ said\nthe witch, ’who are you? and what is your business?’ ’I am,’ said he,\n’a messenger sent by the king to find the finest salad that grows\nunder the sun. I have been lucky enough to find it, and have brought\nit with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to\nwither, and I don’t know that I can carry it farther.’",
        "When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they\nlonged to taste it, and said, ’Dear countryman, let us just taste it.’\n’To be sure,’ answered he; ’I have two heads of it with me, and will\ngive you one’; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the\nwitch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was\nready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves\nimmediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they\nswallowed when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the\ncourt in the form of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the\nkitchen, and seeing the salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on\nthe way she too felt a wish to taste it as the old woman had done, and\nate some leaves; so she also was turned into an ass and ran after the\nother, letting the dish with the salad fall on the ground. The\nmessenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and as\nnobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, ’I\ndon’t know where the salad can be.’ Then he thought something must\nhave happened, and said, ’I will go into the kitchen and see.’ And as\nhe went he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad\nlying on the ground. ’All right!’ said he; ’those two have had their\nshare.’ Then he took up the rest of the leaves, laid them on the dish\nand brought them to the young lady, saying, ’I bring you the dish\nmyself that you may not wait any longer.’ So she ate of it, and like\nthe others ran off into the court braying away.",
        "Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they\nmight know him. ’Now you shall be paid for your roguery,’ said he; and\ntied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he\ncame to a mill and knocked at the window. ’What’s the matter?’ said\nthe miller. ’I have three tiresome beasts here,’ said the other; ’if\nyou will take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell\nyou, I will pay you whatever you ask.’ ’With all my heart,’ said the\nmiller; ’but how shall I treat them?’ Then the huntsman said, ’Give\nthe old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who\nwas the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give\nthe youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no\nstripes’: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.\nAfter this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he\nwanted.",
        "Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass\nwas dead; ’The other two,’ said he, ’are alive and eat, but are so\nsorrowful that they cannot last long.’ Then the huntsman pitied them,\nand told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he\ngave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady\nfell upon her knees before him, and said, ’O dearest huntsman! forgive\nme all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was\nagainst my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak\nhangs up in the closet, and as for the bird’s heart, I will give it\nyou too.’ But he said, ’Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I\nmean to make you my wife.’ So they were married, and lived together\nvery happily till they died.",
