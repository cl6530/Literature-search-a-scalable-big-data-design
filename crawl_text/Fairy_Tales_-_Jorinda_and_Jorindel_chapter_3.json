        "There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep\ngloomy wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy\ncould take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in\nthe form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at\nnight she always became an old woman again. When any young man came\nwithin a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could\nnot move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do\ntill he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any\npretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and\nthe fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the\ncastle. There were seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle,\nand all with beautiful birds in them.",
        "Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier\nthan all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd\nlad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon\nto be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might\nbe alone; and Jorindel said, ’We must take care that we don’t go too\nnear to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays\nof the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees\nupon the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the\ntall birches.",
        "Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and\nboth felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be\nparted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and\nwhen they looked to see which way they should go home, they found\nthemselves at a loss to know what path to take.",
        "The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk\nbehind the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw\nthrough the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close\nunder the old walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned\npale, and trembled. Jorinda was just singing,",
        " ’The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\n  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!\n  He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,\n  Well-a-day!’",
        "when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and\nbeheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended\nwith a mournful /jug, jug/. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times\nround them, and three times screamed:",
        " ’Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’",
        "Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither\nweep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite\ndown; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment\nafter the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and\na nose and chin that almost met one another.",
        "She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went\naway with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone–\nbut what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the\nspot where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a\nhoarse voice:",
        " ’Till the prisoner is fast,\n  And her doom is cast,\n  There stay! Oh, stay!\n  When the charm is around her,\n  And the spell has bound her,\n  Hie away! away!’",
        "On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees\nbefore the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda:\nbut she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then\nshe went her way.",
        "He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ’Alas!’ he said,\n’what will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he\nwent to a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many\na time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he\ndared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.",
        "At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,\nand that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he\nplucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and\nthat everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\nfound his Jorinda again.",
        "In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale\nfor this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain:\nbut on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful\npurple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as\na costly pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled\nday and night, till he came again to the castle.",
        "He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become\nfixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the\ndoor. Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the\ndoor with the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through\nthe court, and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last\nhe came to the chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred\nbirds singing in the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she\nwas very angry, and screamed with rage; but she could not come within\ntwo yards of him, for the flower he held in his hand was his\nsafeguard. He looked around at the birds, but alas! there were many,\nmany nightingales, and how then should he find out which was his\nJorinda? While he was thinking what to do, he saw the fairy had taken\ndown one of the cages, and was making the best of her way off through\nthe door. He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower,\nand Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck\nlooking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked\ntogether in the wood.",
        "Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all\ntook their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were\nmarried, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many\nother lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s\ncages by themselves, much longer than they liked.",
