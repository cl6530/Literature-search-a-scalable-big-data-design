        "I do not think that an old fellow like me need have been\nsitting here to try and prevent your entertaining abject notions\nof yourselves, and talking of yourselves in an abject and ignoble\nway: but to prevent there being by chance among you any such\nyoung men as, after recognising their kindred to the Gods, and\ntheir bondage in these chains of the body and its manifold\nnecessities, should desire to cast them off as burdens too\ngrievous to be borne, and depart to their true kindred. This is\nthe struggle in which your Master and Teacher, were he worthy of\nthe name, should be engaged. You would come to me and say:\n“Epictetus, we can no longer endure being chained to this\nwretched body, giving it food and drink and rest and\npurification;  aye, and for its sake forced to be subservient to\nthis man and that. Are not these things indifferent and nothing\nto us? Is it not true that death is no evil? Are we not in a\nmanner kinsmen of the Gods, and have we not come from them? Let\nus depart thither, whence we came: let us be freed from these\nchains that confine and press us down. Here are thieves and\nrobbers and tribunals: and they that are called tyrants, who\ndeem that they have after a fashion power over us, because of\nthe miserable body and what appertains to it. Let us show them\nthat they have power over none.”",
