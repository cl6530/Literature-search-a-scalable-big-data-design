        "[24] These comments on Mr. Henry Rogers’s review of M. Renan’s\nLes Apotres, contained in a letter to Mr. Lewes, were shortly\nafterwards published by him in the Fortnightly Review, September\n15, 1866,",
        "It is the lot of every book which attempts to treat the origin\nand progress of Christianity in a sober and scientific spirit, to\nmeet with unsparing attacks. Critics in plenty are always to be\nfound, who, possessed with the idea that the entire significance\nand value of the Christian religion are demolished unless we\nregard it as a sort of historical monstrosity, are only too eager\nto subject the offending work to a scathing scrutiny, displaying\nwithal a modicum of righteous indignation at the unblushing\nheresy of the author, not unmixed with a little scornful pity at\nhis inability to believe very preposterous stories upon very\nmeagre evidence. “Conservative” polemics of this sort have\ndoubtless their function. They serve to purge scientific\nliterature of the awkward and careless statements too often made\nby writers not sufficiently instructed or cautious, which in the\nabsence of hostile criticism might get accepted by the unthinking\nreader along with the truths which they accompany. Most\nscientific and philosophical works have their defects; and it is\nfortunate that there is such a thing as dogmatic ardour in the\nworld, ever sharpening its wits to the utmost, that it may spy\neach lurking inaccuracy and ruthlessly drag it to light. But this\nuseful spirit is wont to lead those who are inspired by it to\nshoot beyond the mark, and after pointing out the errors of\nothers, to commit fresh mistakes of their own. In the skilful\ncriticism of M. Renan’s work on the Apostles, in No. 29 of the\n“Fortnightly Review” there is now and then a vulnerable spot\nthrough which a controversial shaft may perhaps be made to\npierce.",
        "It may be true that Lord Lyttelton’s tract on the Conversion of\nSt. Paul, as Dr. Johnson and Dr. Rogers have said, has never yet\nbeen refuted; but if I may judge from my own recollection of the\nwork, I should say that this must be because no competent writer\never thought it worth his pains to criticize it. Its argument\ncontains about as much solid consistency as a distended balloon,\nand collapses as readily at the first puncture. It attempts to\nprove, first, that the conversion of St. Paul cannot be made\nintelligible except on the assumption that there was a miracle in\nthe case; and secondly, that if Paul was converted by a miracle,\nthe truth of Christianity is impregnable. Now, if the first of\nthese points be established, the demonstration is not yet\ncomplete, for the second point must be proved independently. But\nif the first point be overthrown, the second loses its prop, and\nfalls likewise.",
        "Great efforts are therefore made to show that no natural\ninfluences could have intervened to bring about a change in the\nfeelings of Paul. He was violent, “thorough,” unaffected by pity\nor remorse; and accordingly he could not have been so completely\naltered as he was, had he not actually beheld the risen Christ:\nsuch is the argument which Mr. Rogers deems so conclusive. I do\nnot know that from any of Paul’s own assertions we are entitled\nto affirm that no shade of remorse had ever crossed his mind\nprevious to the vision near Damascus. But waiving this point, I\ndo maintain that, granting Paul’s feelings to have been as Mr.\nRogers thinks they were, his conversion is inexplicable, even on\nthe hypothesis of a miracle. He that is determined not to\nbelieve, will not believe, though one should rise from the dead.\nTo make Paul a believer, it was not enough that he should meet\nhis Lord face to face he must have been already prepared to\nbelieve. Otherwise he would have easily found means of explaining\nthe miracle from his own point of view. He would certainly have\nattributed it to the wiles of the demon, even as the Pharisees\nare said to have done with regard to the miraculous cures\nperformed by Jesus. A “miraculous” occurrence in those days did\nnot astonish as it would at present. “Miracles” were rather the\norder of the day, and in fact were lavished with such extreme\nbounty on all hands, that their convincing power was very slight.\nNeither side ever thought of disputing the reality of the\nmiracles supposed to be performed on the other; but each side\nconsidered the miracles of its antagonist to be the work of\ndiabolic agencies. Such being the case, it is useless to suppose\nthat Paul could have distinguished between a true and a false\nmiracle, or that a real miracle could of itself have had any\neffect in inducing him to depart from his habitual course of\nbelief and action. As far as Paul’s mental operations were\nconcerned, it could have made no difference whether he met with\nhis future Master in person, or merely encountered him in a\nvision. The sole point to be considered is whether or not he\nBELIEVED in the Divine character and authority of the event which\nhad happened. What the event might have really been was of no\npractical consequence to him or to any one else. What he believed\nit to be was of the first importance. And since he did believe\nthat he had been divinely summoned to cease persecuting, and\ncommence preaching the new faith, it follows that his state of\nmind must have been more or less affected by circumstances other\nthan the mere vision. Had he not been ripe for change, neither\nshadow nor substance could have changed him.",
        "This view of the case is by no means so extravagant as Mr. Rogers\nwould have us suppose. There is no reason for believing that\nPaul’s character was essentially different afterwards from what\nit had been before. The very fervour which caused him, as a\nPharisee, to exclude all but orthodox Jews from the hope of\nsalvation, would lead him, as a Christian, to carry the Christian\nidea to its extreme development, and admit all persons whatever\nto the privileges of the Church. The same zeal for the truth\nwhich had urged him to persecute the Christians unto the death\nafterwards led him to spare no toil and shun no danger which\nmight bring about the triumph of their cause. It must not be\nforgotten that the persecutor and the martyr are but one and the\nsame man under different circumstances. He who is ready to die\nfor his own faith will sometimes think it fair to make other men\ndie for theirs. Men of a vehement and fiery temperament,\nmoreover,—such as Paul always was,—never change their opinions\nslowly, never rest in philosophic doubt, never take a middle\ncourse. If they leave one extreme for an instant, they are drawn\nirresistibly to the other; and usually very little is needed to\nwork the change. The conversion of Omar is a striking instance in\npoint, and has been cited by M. Renan himself. The character of\nOmar bears a strong likeness to that of Paul. Previous to his\nconversion, he was a conscientious and virulent persecutor of\nMohammedanism.[25] After his conversion, he was Mohammed’s most\nefficient disciple, and it may be safely asserted that for\ndisinterestedness and self-abnegation he was not inferior to the\nApostle of the Gentiles. The change in his case was, moreover,\nquite as sudden and unexpected as it was with Paul; it was\nneither more nor less incomprehensible; and if Paul’s conversion\nneeds a miracle to explain it, Omar’s must need one likewise. But\nin truth, there is no difficulty in the case, save that which\nstupid dogmatism has created. The conversions of Paul and Omar\nare paralleled by innumerable events which occur in every period\nof religious or political excitement. Far from being\nextraordinary, or inexplicable on natural grounds, such phenomena\nare just what might occasionally be looked for.",

        "But, says Mr. Rogers, “is it possible for a moment to imagine the\ndoting and dreaming victim of hallucinations (which M. Renan’s\ntheory represents Paul) to be the man whose masculine sense,\nstrong logic, practical prudence, and high administrative talent\nappear in the achievements of his life, and in the Epistles he\nhas left behind him?” M. Renan’s theory does not, however,\nrepresent Paul as the “victim of hallucinations “to a greater\ndegree than Mohammed. The latter, as every one knows, laboured\nduring much of his life under almost constant “hallucination\";\nyet “masculine sense, strong logic,” etc., were qualities quite\nas conspicuous in him as in St. Paul.",
        "Here, as throughout his essay, Mr. Rogers shows himself totally\nunable to comprehend the mental condition of men in past ages. If\nan Apostle has a dream or sees a vision, and interprets it\naccording to the ideas of his time and country, instead of\naccording to the ideas of scientific England in the nineteenth\ncentury Mr. Rogers thinks he must needs be mad: and when\naccording to the well-known law that mental excitement is\ncontagious,[26] several persons are said to have concurred in\ninterpreting some phenomenon supernaturally, Mr. Rogers cannot\nsee why so many people should all go mad at once! “To go mad,” in\nfact is his favourite designation for a mental act, which nearly\nall the human race have habitually performed in all ages; the act\nof mistaking subjective impressions for outward realities. The\ndisposition to regard all strange phenomena as manifestations of\nsupernatural power was universally prevalent in the first century\nof Christianity, and long after. Neither greatness of intellect\nnor thoroughness of scepticism gave exemption. Even Julius\nCaesar, the greatest practical genius that ever lived, was\nsomewhat superstitious, despite his atheism and his Vigorous\ncommon-sense. It is too often argued that the prevalence of\nscepticism in the Roman Empire must have made men scrupulous\nabout accepting miracles. By no means. Nothing but physical\nscience ever drives out miracles: mere doctrinal scepticism is\npowerless to do it. In the age of the Apostles, little if any\nradical distinction was drawn between a miracle and an ordinary\noccurrence. No one supposed a miracle to be an infraction of the\nlaws of nature, for no one had a clear idea that there were such\nthings as laws of nature. A miracle was simply an extraordinary\nact, exhibiting the power of the person who performed it. Blank,\nindeed, would the evangelists have looked, had any one told them\nwhat an enormous theory of systematic meddling with nature was\ndestined to grow out of their beautiful and artless narratives.",

        "The incapacity to appreciate this frame of mind renders the\ncurrent arguments in behalf of miracles utterly worthless. From\nthe fact that Celsus and others never denied the reality of the\nChristian miracles, it is commonly inferred that those miracles\nmust have actually happened. The same argument would, however,\nequally apply to the miracles of Apollonius and Simon Magus, for\nthe Christians never denied the reality of these. What these\nfacts really prove is that the state of human intelligence was as\nI have just described it: and the inference to be drawn from them\nis that no miraculous account emanating from an author of such a\nperiod is worthy of serious attention. When Mr. Rogers supposes\nthat if the miracles had not really happened they would have been\nchallenged, he is assuming that a state of mind existed in which\nit was possible for miracles to be challenged; and thus commits\nan anachronism as monstrous as if he had attributed the knowledge\nof some modern invention, such as steamboats, to those early\nages.",
        "Mr. Rogers seems to complain of M. Renan for “quietly assuming\"\nthat miracles are invariably to be rejected. Certainly a\nhistorian of the present day who should not make such an\nassumption would betray his lack of the proper qualifications for\nhis profession. It is not considered necessary for every writer\nto begin his work by setting out to prove the first principles of\nhistorical criticism. They are taken for granted. And, as M.\nRenan justly says, a miracle is one of those things which must be\ndisbelieved until it is proved. The onus probandi lies on the\nassertor of a fact which conflicts with universal experience.\nNevertheless, the great number of intelligent persons who, even\nnow, from dogmatic reasons, accept the New Testament miracles,\nforbids that they should be passed over in silence like similar\nphenomena elsewhere narrated. But, in the present state of\nhistorical science, the arguing against miracles is, as Colet\nremarked of his friend Erasmus’s warfare against the Thomists and\nScotists of Cambridge, “a contest more necessary than glorious or\ndifficult.” To be satisfactorily established, a miracle needs at\nleast to be recorded by an eyewitness; and the mental attainments\nof the witness need to be thoroughly known besides. Unless he has\na clear conception of the difference between the natural and the\nunnatural order of events, his testimony, however unimpeachable\non the score of honesty, is still worthless. To say that this\ncondition was fulfilled by those who described the New Testament\nmiracles, would be absurd. And in the face of what German\ncriticism has done for the early Christian documents, it would be\nan excess of temerity to assert that any one of the supernatural\naccounts contained in them rests on contemporary authority. Of\nall history, the miraculous part should be attested by the\nstrongest testimony, whereas it is invariably attested by the\nweakest. And the paucity of miracles wherever we have\ncontemporary records, as in the case of primitive Islamism, is a\nmost significant fact.",
        "In attempting to defend his principle of never accepting a\nmiracle, M. Renan has indeed got into a sorry plight, and Mr.\nRogers, in controverting him, has not greatly helped the matter.\nBy stirring M. Renan’s bemuddled pool, Mr. Rogers has only\nbemuddled it the more. Neither of these excellent writers seems\nto suspect that transmutation of species, the geologic\ndevelopment of the earth, and other like phenomena do not present\nfeatures conflicting with ordinary experience. Sir Charles Lyell\nand Mr. Darwin would be greatly astonished to be told that their\ntheories of inorganic and organic evolution involved any agencies\nnot known to exist in the present course of nature. The great\nachievement of these writers has been to show that all past\nchanges of the earth and its inhabitants are to be explained as\nresulting from the continuous action of causes like those now in\noperation, and that throughout there has been nothing even\nfaintly resembling a miracle. M. Renan may feel perfectly safe in\nextending his principle back to the beginning of things; and Mr.\nRogers’s argument, even if valid against M. Renan, does not help\nhis own case in the least.",
        "On some points, indeed, M. Renan has laid himself open to severe\ncriticism, and on other points he has furnished good handles for\nhis orthodox opponents. His views in regard to the authorship of\nthe Fourth Gospel and the Acts are not likely to be endorsed by\nmany scholars; and his revival of the rationalistic absurdities\nof Paulus merits in most instances all that Mr. Rogers has said\nabout it. As was said at the outset, orthodox criticisms upon\nheterodox books are always welcome. They do excellent service.\nAnd with the feeling which impels their authors to defend their\nfavourite dogmas with every available weapon of controversy I for\none can heartily sympathize. Their zeal in upholding what they\nconsider the truth is greatly to be respected and admired. But so\nmuch cannot always be said for the mode of argumentation they\nadopt, which too often justifies M. Renan’s description, when he\nsays, “Raisonnements triomphants sur des choses que l’adversaire\nn’a pas dites, cris de victoire sur des erreurs qu’il n’a pas\ncommises, rien ne parait deloyal a celui qui croft tenir en main\nles interets de la verite absolue.”",
