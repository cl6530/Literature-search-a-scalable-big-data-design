        "Connla of the Fiery Hair was son of Conn of the Hundred Fights. One\nday as he stood by the side of his father on the height of Usna, he\nsaw a maiden clad in strange attire coming towards him.",
        "“Whence comest thou, maiden?” said Connla.",
        "“I come from the Plains of the Ever Living,” she said, “there where\nthere is neither death nor sin. There we keep holiday alway, nor\nneed we help from any in our joy. And in all our pleasure we have no\nstrife. And because we have our homes in the round green hills, men\ncall us the Hill Folk.”",
        "The king and all with him wondered much to hear a voice when they\nsaw no one. For save Connla alone, none saw the Fairy Maiden.",
        "“To whom art thou talking, my son?” said Conn the king.",
        "Then the maiden answered, “Connla speaks to a young, fair maid, whom\nneither death nor old age awaits. I love Connla, and now I call him\naway to the Plain of Pleasure, Moy Mell, where Boadag is king for\naye, nor has there been complaint or sorrow in that land since he\nhas held the kingship. Oh, come with me, Connla of the Fiery Hair,\nruddy as the dawn with thy tawny skin. A fairy crown awaits thee to\ngrace thy comely face and royal form. Come, and never shall thy\ncomeliness fade, nor thy youth, till the last awful day of\njudgment.”",
        "The king in fear at what the maiden said, which he heard though he\ncould not see her, called aloud to his Druid, Coran by name.",
        "“Oh, Coran of the many spells,” he said, “and of the cunning magic,\nI call upon thy aid. A task is upon me too great for all my skill\nand wit, greater than any laid upon me since I seized the kingship.\nA maiden unseen has met us, and by her power would take from me my\ndear, my comely son. If thou help not, he will be taken from thy\nking by woman’s wiles and witchery.”",
        "Then Coran the Druid stood forth and chanted his spells towards the\nspot where the maiden’s voice had been heard. And none heard her\nvoice again, nor could Connla see her longer. Only as she vanished\nbefore the Druid’s mighty spell, she threw an apple to Connla.",
        "For a whole month from that day Connla would take nothing, either to\neat or to drink, save only from that apple. But as he ate it grew\nagain and always kept whole. And all the while there grew within him\na mighty yearning and longing after the maiden he had seen.",
        "But when the last day of the month of waiting came, Connla stood by\nthe side of the king his father on the Plain of Arcomin, and again\nhe saw the maiden come towards him, and again she spoke to him.",
        "“’Tis a glorious place, forsooth, that Connla holds among short-\nlived mortals awaiting the day of death. But now the folk of life,\nthe ever-living ones, beg and bid thee come to Moy Mell, the Plain\nof Pleasure, for they have learnt to know thee, seeing thee in thy\nhome among thy dear ones.”",
        "When Conn the king heard the maiden’s voice he called to his men\naloud and said:",
        "“Summon swift my Druid Coran, for I see she has again this day the\npower of speech.”",
        "Then the maiden said: “Oh, mighty Conn, fighter of a hundred fights,\nthe Druid’s power is little loved; it has little honour in the\nmighty land, peopled with so many of the upright. When the Law will\ncome, it will do away with the Druid’s magic spells that come from\nthe lips of the false black demon.”",
        "Then Conn the king observed that since the maiden came, Connla his\nson spoke to none that spake to him. So Conn of the hundred fights\nsaid to him, “Is it to thy mind what the woman says, my son?”",
        "“’Tis hard upon me,” then said Connla; “I love my own folk above all\nthings; but yet, but yet a longing seizes me for the maiden.”",
        "When the maiden heard this, she answered and said “The ocean is not\nso strong as the waves of thy longing. Come with me in my curragh,\nthe gleaming, straight-gliding crystal canoe. Soon we can reach\nBoadag’s realm. I see the bright sun sink, yet far as it is, we can\nreach it before dark. There is, too, another land worthy of thy\njourney, a land joyous to all that seek it. Only wives and maidens\ndwell there. If thou wilt, we can seek it and live there alone\ntogether in joy.”",
        "When the maiden ceased to speak, Connla of the Fiery Hair rushed\naway from them and sprang into the curragh, the gleaming, straight-\ngliding crystal canoe. And then they all, king and court, saw it\nglide away over the bright sea towards the setting sun. Away and\naway, till eye could see it no longer, and Connla and the Fairy\nMaiden went their way on the sea, and were no more seen, nor did any\nknow where they came.",
