        "This book is intended to put in the smallest possible space the means by\nwhich one may reach the chief places of interest in England and Wales.\nIt will possibly make many holidays, week-ends, or isolated days more\nenjoyable by placing a defined objective before the rambler. Places\nwithin an hour or two of London are in the front of the book, so that as\none turns over the pages one is taken further and further afield. The\nbrief summary of the interests of each place, and the many\nillustrations, may help to memorise the impressions obtained.",
        "The first edition of a book of this nature must of necessity be\nincomplete, and the author is prepared to hear of long lists of places\nwhich should have been included, and also to hear criticisms on his\nchoice of those appearing. It is to some extent natural that special\nfamiliarity with certain places and certain writers or heroes of the\npast may distort one’s vision, and perhaps induce a choice of subjects\nwhich may not seem so comprehensive to some individuals as to others.\nFuture editions will, however, give ample scope for embracing all the\ngood suggestions which may be made.",
