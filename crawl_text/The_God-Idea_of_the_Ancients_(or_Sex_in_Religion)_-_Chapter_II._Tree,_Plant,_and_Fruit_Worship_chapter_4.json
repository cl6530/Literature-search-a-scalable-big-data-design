        "When mankind first began to perceive the fact of an all-pervading\nagency throughout Nature, by or through which everything is\nproduced, and when they began to speculate on the origin of life\nand the final cause and destiny of things, it is not in the least\nremarkable that various objects and elements, such as fire, air,\nwater, trees, etc., should in their turn have been venerated as\nin some special manner embodying the divine essence.  Neither is\nit surprising although this universal agency was regarded as one,\nor as a dual entity, they should have recognized its manifold\nexpressions or manifestations.",
        "To primitive man, the visible sources whence proceeded his daily\nsustenance doubtless constituted the first objects of his regard\nand adoration.  Hence, in addition to the homage paid to the\nearth, in due course of time would be added the worship of trees,\nupon which the early race was directly dependent for food.  At a\ntime when the art of agriculture had not been attained, all such\ntrees as yielded their fruit for the support of the human race,\nand which afforded to mankind pleasant beverages or cooling\nshade, would come to be regarded as embodying the universal\nbeneficent principle–the great creating and preserving agency of\nNature, and therefore as proper objects of veneration.",
        "According to the Phoenician theogony, “the first gods which were\nworshipped by oblations and sacrifices were the fruits of the\nearth, on which they and their descendants lived as their\nforefathers had done.”",
        "Although, after the art of agriculture had been developed,\nmankind was gradually relieved from its past dependence on the\ntree as a means of support, it nevertheless continued to be\nregarded with veneration as an emblem of creative power or of\nproductive energy.",
        "Among the traditions and monuments of nearly every country of the\nglobe are to be found traces of a sacred tree–a Tree of Life. \nIn various countries there appear two traditional trees, the one\ntypical of the continuation of physical life, the other\nrepresenting spiritual life, or the life of the soul.  After the\nage of pure Nature-worship had passed, however, and serpent,\nfire, and phallic faiths had been introduced, the original\nsignification of the tree, like that of all other religious\nemblems, became considerably changed.  Through its energies, or\nlife-giving properties, existence had long been maintained, and\nfor this reason, as has already been observed, it became an\nobject of veneration; but, after the reproductive power in man\nhad risen to the dignity of a supreme God, the tree, to the\nmasses of the people, became a symbol of the physical,\nlife-giving energy in mortals and in animals.  In other words, it\nbecame a phallic emblem representing the continuation of\nexistence, or the power to reproduce or continue life on the\nearth.  As a religious symbol it became the traditional Tree of\nLife.",
        "The tree, like nearly every other object in nature, was and still\nis, in various parts of the world, either female or male, and all\nideas connected with it are sacred and closely interwoven with\nsex.",
        "The extent to which trees have been venerated in past ages seems\nto be little understood, and there are doubtless few persons, at\nthe present time, who would willingly believe that all along the\nreligious stream, from its source to its latest developed\nbranches, are to be observed traces of this ancient worship,\nwhich, in its earliest stages, was simply a recognition of\nNature’s bounties.",
        "Barlow, in his work on Symbolism, says that “the most generally\nreceived symbol of life is a tree–as also the most appropriate.”",
        "Again the same writer observes: “Besides the monumental evidence\nthus furnished of a sacred tree, or Tree of Life, there is an\nhistorical and traditional evidence of the same thing, found in\nthe early literature of various nations, in the customs, and\npopular usages.\"[6] As tree- and sun-worship, or the adoration of\nNature’s processes, finally became interwoven with phallic\nfaiths, its history can be understood only after these later\ndevelopments in the religious stream have been examined, or after\nthe true significance of the serpent as a religious emblem, and\nthe various ideas connected with the traditional Tree of Life,\nhave been exposed.",

        "The palm, the pine, the oak, the banian, or bo, and many other\nspecies of trees, have, at different times, and by various\nnations, been invested with divine honors; but, in oriental\ncountries, by far the most sacred among them is the Ficus\nReligiosa, or the holy bo tree of India.  Something of the true\nsignificance of the traditional Tree of Life may be observed in\nthe ideas connected with the worship of this emblem.  The fig,\nwhen planted with the palm, as it frequently is in the East, near\ntemples and holy shrines, is regarded as a peculiarly sacred\nobject.  When entwining the palm, which is male, it is always\nfemale; from their embrace Kalpia, or passion, is developed. \nThis union causes the continuation of existence and the\n“revolutions of time.”  The whole constitutes the Tree of Life.",
        "In Ceylon, there stands at the present time a tree which we are\ntold is still worshipped by every follower of Buddha.  It is a\nsacred bo, or Ficus Religiosa, which stands adjacent to an\nancient holy shrine known as the Brazen Monastery, now in ruins. \nOf this tree Forlong remarks:",
        "“Though now amidst ruins and wild forests, and although having\nstood thus in solitary desolation for some 1500 years, yet there\nit still grows, and is worshipped and deeply revered by more\nmillions of our race than any other god, prophet, or idol, which\nthe world has ever seen.\"[7]",
        "[7] Rivers of Life, vol. i., p. 35.",
        "This tree is sacred to Sakyu Mooni, is 2200 years old, and is\nsaid to be a slip from a tree planted by Bood Gaya, one of the\nthree former Buddhas who, like Sakyu Mooni, visited Ceylon. \nUnder the parent of this tree the great prophet reposed after he\nhad attained perfect rest, or after he had overcome the flesh and\nbecome Buddha.  It was under a bo tree that Mai, Queen of Heaven,\nbrought him forth, and, in fact, very many of the most important\nincidents of his life are closely connected with this sacred\nemblem.",
        "In an allusion to the bo tree of Ceylon, a slip of which is said\nto have been carried from India to that island by a certain\npriestess in the year 307 B.C., Forlong observes:",
        "“This wonderful idol has furnished shoots to half Asia, and every\nshoot is trained as much as possible like the parent, and like\nit, also, enclosed and tended.  Men watch and listen for signs\nand sounds from this holy tree just as the priests of Dodona did\nbeneath their rustling oaks, and, as many people, even of these\nsomewhat sceptical days, still do, beneath the pulpits of their\npope, priest, or other oracle.\"[8]",

        "The sacred Ficus is worshipped in India and in many of the\nPolynesian islands.",
        "Regarding the palm, Inman assures us that it is emblematical of\nthe active male energy, or the continuation of existence.[9]",

        "Within the legends underlying the Jewish religion, it will be\nremembered that the tree appears mysteriously connected with the\nbeginning of life and is interwoven with the first ideas of human\naction and experience.  The literal sense, however, of the\nallegory in Genesis concerning the woman, the tree, and the\nserpent, and its meaning as generally accepted by laymen and the\nuneducated among the priesthood, has little in common with its\ntrue significance as understood by the initiated.",
        "In Vedic times, the home tree was worshipped as a god, and to the\nexhilarating properties in its juice was ascribed that subtle\nquality which was regarded as the life-giving, or creative,\nenergy supposed to reside in heat, and which was closely\nconnected with passion or procreative energy.  This quality was\ntheir Bacchus, Dionysos, or god-idea–the creator not alone of\nphysical existence, but of good and evil as well.  It was the\nDestroyer, yet the Regenerator, of life.",
        "Of the Zoroastrian home, or sacred tree, which by the Persians\nwas worshipped for thousands of years, Layard remarks: “The plant\nor its product was called the mystical body of God, the living\nwater or food of eternal life, when duly consecrated and\nadministered according to Zoroastrian rites.”  It has been\nsuggested, and not without reason, that to this idea of the\nancients, respecting the sacred character of the properties of\nthe home juice, may be traced the “origin of the celebration of\nJewish holy or paschal suppers and other eucharistic rites.”",
        "Although by the ancients water was sometimes regarded as the\noriginal principle, later, wine, or the intoxicating quality\nwithin it, came to constitute the god-idea.  It was spirit, while\nwater was matter; hence, in the sacraments, water and wine were\ncommingled, wine representing the essence or blood of God; water,\nat the same time, standing for the people.  Cyprian, the bishop\nmartyr, while contending for the use of wine in the Sacrament of\nthe Lord’s Supper, makes use of the following argument:",
        "“The Holy Spirit also is not silent in the Psalms on the\nsacrament of this thing, when He makes mention of the Lord’s Cup,\nand says ’Thy intoxicating cup how excellent it is!’  Now the cup\nwhich intoxicates is assuredly mingled with wine, for water\ncannot intoxicate anybody.  And the Cup of the Lord in such wise\ninebriates, as Noe also was intoxicated drinking wine in Genesis. \n.  .  .  For because Christ bore us all, in that he also bore our\nsins, we see that in the water is understood the people, but in\nthe wine is showed the blood of Christ.  .  .  .  Thus,\ntherefore, in consecrating the Cup of the Lord, water alone\ncannot be offered, even as wine alone cannot be offered.  For if\nanyone offer wine only, the blood of Christ is dissociated from\nus; but if the water be alone, the people are dissociated from\nChrist.\"[10]",
        "[10] Epistles of Cyprian, vol. i., pp. 215-217.",
        "The Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, at which wine is mysteriously\nconverted into the essence of Deity, or into the blood of Christ,\nis without doubt a relic of the idea once entertained regarding\nthe homa tree.  Certain writers entertain the opinion that from\nthe use of the sacred homa juice have arisen various religious\npractices and rites, such for instance as offering oblations to\nthe gods, anointing holy stones, and pouring wine on sacred\nhills, also the custom of pledging oaths over glasses of wine.",
        "The May pole, a decidedly phallic emblem, whose festivals until a\nvery recent time were celebrated in England by the old as well as\nthe young, was usually if not always sprinkled with wine.  From\nthe accounts which we have of this sacred emblem and its\nfestival, it seems that no royal edict nor priestly denunciation\nwas sufficient to expel it from the country.",
        "According to Dr. Stevenson, the festival of Holi or the worship\nof Holika Devata, in the island of Ceylon, “has a close\nresemblance to the English festival of the May-pole, which\noriginated in a religious ceremony or festival of the Cushites\n(called Phoenicians) who anciently occupied Western Europe.\"[11]",
        "[11] Quoted by Baldwin, Prehistoric Nations, p. 223.",
        "The ash is the Scandinavian Tree of Life, and, like the sacred\ntrees of all nations, is emblematical of the continuation of\nexistence.  This tree has a triple root, which peculiarity\ndoubtless accounts for its sacred character.  It is both female\nand male, and is said to be regarded as a “sort of Logos or\nWisdom.”  It is the first emanation from the Deity, and yet a\nTrinity in Unity.  To insult or injure this tree was sacrilege,\nto cut it down was an offense punishable with death.",
        "In the old Egyptian and Zoroastrian story, appear the\ndescriptions of two Trees of Life, also a Tree of Knowledge.  In\nthe accounts given of these trees, the Ficus, the female Tree of\nLife, represents the life of the soul, while the palm, the male\nTree of Life, is that which gives physical life, which also is\nthe true significance of the word “lord.”  When, however, either\nof these trees stood alone, or unaccompanied by its counterpart,\nby it both of the creative principles were understood.  By these\nideas is suggested the thought which among a certain school of\npsychologists of the present century seems to be gaining ground,\nnamely: that man is a dual entity, or, in other words, that he\nhas a subjective mind and an objective self, which so long as\nthis life endures must co-operate or work together.",
        "In the following descriptions of Egyptian emblems, will be\nperceived some of the changes which finally took place relative\nto the idea of sex in the god-idea.",
        "In the museum of Egyptian antiquities in Berlin is a sepulchral\ntablet representing the Tree of Life.  This emblem figures the\ntrunk of a tree, from the top of which emerges the bust of a\nwoman–Netpe.  She is the goddess of heavenly existence, and is\nadministering to the deceased the water and the bread of life,\nthe latter of which is represented by a substance in the form of\ncakes or rolls.  The time at which this tablet was found is not\nknown, but it is supposed to belong to the period of the XIXth\ndynasty, or about the time of Rameses II., 1400 years B.C.",
        "There is also in the Berlin museum another representation of the\nEgyptian Tree of Life, in which the trunk has given place to the\nentire body of a woman.  This, also, is Netpe, who is still\nspiritual wisdom or the maternal principle.  We are informed by\nForlong that Diana was worshipped by the Amazons under a sacred\ntree.[12] From this symbol the tree, which grew first into the\nfigure of a divine woman, and later assumed the form of a divine\nman, arose the emblem of the cross.",
        "[12] Rivers of Life, vol. i., p. 70.",
        "On the Nineveh tablets is pictured a Tree of Life which is\nsurrounded by winged spirits, bearing in their hands the pine\ncone, a symbol indicating life, and which is said to have the\nsame significance as the crux-ansata, or cross, among the\nEgyptians.",
        "In later ages, the Tree of Life, i. e., the divine man, or\ncross, or both together, furnish immortal food to those who lay\nhold upon them, exactly in the same manner as did Netpe, the\ngoddess of wisdom, or spiritual life, in former times.  According\nto the testimony of Barlow, this is the subject “most frequently\nsymbolized on early Christian sepulchral tablets and\nmonuments.\"[13] Christ’s body was the “bread of life,” and his\nblood was the “wine from the Tree of Life,” of which to partake\nwas life eternal.  The cross, as in earlier religions,\nrepresented completeness of life.  The jambu tree, the Buddhist\ngod-tree, is in the shape of a cross.[14]",

        "Among the Kelti a tall oak was not only a symbol of the Deity,\nbut it was Jupiter himself, while the earth from which it sprang\nwas the Great Mother.  Throughout Europe, in all ages, the oak\nhas received divine honors.  The fact that under its branches\nJew, Pagan, and Christian alike swore their most solemn oaths,\nshows that its veneration was not confined to any particular\nnation or locality.",
        "The sacredness of the oak among the Druids is well attested by\nall writers who have dealt with this interesting people.  In Rome\nits branches formed the badge of victory worn by conquering\nheroes, this emblem being the highest mark of distinction which\ncould be conferred upon them.",
        "Forlong assures us that the oak was even more worshipped at the\nWest than was the sacred Ficus at the East.  Like it, the wood of\nthe oak must be used",
        "“to call down the sacred fire from Heaven and gladden in the yule\n(Suiel or Seul) log of Christmas-tide even Christian fires, as\nwell as annually renew with fire direct from Ba-al, on Beltine\nday, the sacred flame on every public and private hearth, and\nthis from the temples of Meroe on the Nile, to the farthest icy\nforests and mountains of the Sklavonian.\"[15]",

        "Among the Druids, the mistletoe was also sacred especially when\nentwining the oak.  Together they represented the Tree of Life,\nor the two generating agencies throughout Nature.  Of the species\nof it which grows on the oak, Borlaise says that they deified the\nmistletoe and were not to look upon it but in the most devout and\nreverential manner: “When the end of the year approached, they\nmarched with great solemnity to gather the mistletoe of the oak\nin order to present it to Jupiter, inviting all the world to\nassist in the ceremony.\"[16]",
        "[16] Borlaise.",
        "According to the Latin writer Pliny, the “Druids have nothing\nmore sacred than the mistletoe and the tree on which it grows,\nprovided it be an oak.”  This plant, which is called All Heal,\nalthough sought after with the greatest religious ardor, is\nseldom found, but should the people who go forth at Christmas\ntime in large numbers succeed in finding it they immediately set\nabout preparing feasts under the tree upon which it grows; at the\nsame time, in the most solemn manner, two white bulls are brought\nforth to be sacrificed.  After the feast has been prepared and\nthe sacrifice made ready, the priest ascends the tree and with a\ngolden pruning-knife cuts the sacred branches of the mistletoe,\ndropping them into a white cloth prepared for the occasion.  The\nbulls are then sacrificed and a prayer offered that “God would\nrender his own gift prosperous to those on whom he has bestowed\nit.”  They believed that administered in a potion it would impart\nfecundity to any barren animal, and that it was a remedy against\nall kinds of poison.  The branches of the mistletoe were then\ndistributed among the faithful, each cherishing the token as the\nmost sacred emblem of his faith.  It is thought that the\nChristmas tree is a remnant of this custom.",
        "Although the Christbaum of the Germans, the Yggdrasill of the\nScandinavians, and the Christmas tree of the English speaking\nnations are still regarded as belonging exclusively to\nChristianity, their birthplace was the far East, and their origin\nlong anterior to our present era.  This subject will be referred\nto later in these pages.  The palm, which in course of time\nbecame the most sacred tree of Egypt, is said to have put forth a\nshoot every month during the year.  At Christmas tide, or at the\nwinter solstice, a branch from this tree was used as a symbol of\nthe renewal of time or of the birth of the New Year.",
        "On the Zodiac of Dendera, preserved in the National Library at\nParis, are two trees, the one representing the East, or India and\nChina, the other, the West, or Egypt.  The former of these trees\nis putting forth a pair of leaves and is topped by the emblems of\nSiva, emblems which indicate the fructifying powers of Nature,\nwhilst the Egyptian sacred tree, which is surmounted by the\nostrich plume, the emblem of truth, is indicative of Light,\nIntelligence, or the life of the soul.  In a discourse delivered\nby Dr. Stukeley in 1760, attention was directed to the grove of\nAbraham as “that famous oak grove of Beersheba, planted by the\nillustrious prophet and first Druid–Abraham; and from whom our\ncelebrated British Druids came, who were of the same patriarchal\nreformed religion, and brought the use of sacred groves to\nBritain.\"[17]",

        "The fact has been ascertained that in Arabia, in very ancient\ntimes, there was a goddess named Azra who was worshipped under\nthe form of a tree called Samurch, and that in Yemen tree-worship\nstill prevails.  To the date is ascribed divine honors.  This\ntree is said to have its regular priests, services, rites, and\nfestivals, and is as zealously worshipped as are the gods of any\nother country.  We are not informed as to whether the Jewish Tree\nof Life was borrowed from the Chaldeans or the Egyptians, but, as\nthe significance is the same in all countries, it is of little\nconsequence which furnished a copy for the writer in Genesis.",
        "In Dr. Inman’s Ancient Faiths, is a drawing from the original,\nby Colonel Coombs, of the “Temptation,” or of the ancient\ntree-and-serpent myth in Genesis.  This drawing, in which it is\nobserved that the Jewish idea of woman as tempter is reversed,\nwas copied from the inner walls of a cave in Southern India.  The\npicture is said to be a faithful representation of the version of\nthe story as accepted in the East.",
        "Of the myrtle, Payne Knight says that it “was a symbol both of\nVenus and Neptune, the male and female personifications of the\nproductive powers of the waters, which appear to have been\noccasionally employed in the same sense as the fig and fig leaf.”",
        "The same writer refers to the fact that instead of beads, wreaths\nof foliage, generally of laurel, olive, myrtle, ivy, or oak,\nappear upon coins; sometimes encircling the symbolical figures,\nand sometimes as chaplets on their heads.  According to Strabo,\neach of these is sacred to some particular personification of the\nDeity, and “significant of some particular attribute, and in\ngeneral, all evergreens were Dionysiac plants, that is, symbols\nof the generative power, signifying perpetuity of youth and\nvigor.”  The crowns of laurel, olive, etc., with which the\nvictors in the Roman triumphs and Grecian games were honored,\nwere emblems of immortality, and not merely transitory marks of\noccasional distinction.[18]",

        "The tree and serpent, according to Ferguson, are symbolized in\nall religious systems which the world has ever known.  The two\ntogether are typical of the processes of reproduction or\ngeneration.  They also symbolize good and evil and the cause\nwhich underlies the decline of virtue.",
        "Among the numberless fruits which from time to time have been\nregarded as divine emblems, the principal are perhaps the fig,\nthe pomegranate, the mandrake, the almond, and the olive.  The\npeculiarly sacred character which we find attached to the fig\nceases to be a mystery so soon as we remember that the organs of\ngeneration, male and female, had, in process of time, come to be\nobjects of worship and that the fig was the emblem of the latter.",
        "A basket of this fruit is said to have been the most acceptable\noffering to the god Bacchus, and therefore, by his devotees, was\nregarded as the most sacred symbol.  The favorite material for\nphallic devices was the wood of the sacred fig, for it was by\nrubbing together pieces of it that holy fire was supposed to be\ndrawn from heaven.  By holy fire, however, was meant not so much\nthe natural visible element which was kindled, as that subtle\nsubstance contained in fire or heat which was supposed to contain\nthe life principle, and which was sent in response to the\ncravings of pious devotees for procreative energy, which\nblessing, among various peoples, notably the Jews, was indicative\nof special divine favor.",
        "By pagans, Jews, and Christians, the pomegranate has long been\nregarded as a sacred emblem.  It is a symbol of reproductive\nenergy.  Representations of it were embroidered on the Ephod, and\nSolomon’s Temple is reported as having been literally covered\nwith decorations, in which, among the devices noticed, this\nparticular fruit appears the most conspicuous.  Its significance,\nas revealed by Inman and other writers, is too gross to be set\nforth in these pages.",
        "Among the most sacred plants or flowers were the lotus and the\nfleur de lis, both of which were venerated because of some real\nor fancied organic sexual peculiarity.  The lotus is adored as\nthe female principle throughout Nature, or as the “womb of all\ncreation,” and is sacred throughout oriental countries.  It is\nsaid to be androgynous or hermaphrodite–hence its peculiarly\nsacred character.",
        "It has long been thought that this lily is produced without the\naid of the male pollen, hence it would seem to be an appropriate\nemblem for that ancient sect which worshipped the female as the\nmore important creative energy.",
        "Of the lotus, Inman remarks: “Amongst fourteen kinds of food and\nflowers presented to the Sanskrit God Anata, the lotus only is\nindispensable.”  This emblem, as we have seen, was the symbol of\nthe Great Mother, and we are assured that it was “little less\nsacred than the Queen of Heaven herself.”",
        "Regarding the lotus and its universal significance as a religious\nemblem, Payne Knight says:",
        "“The lotus is the Nelumbo of Linnaeus.  This plant grows in the\nwater, and amongst its broad leaves puts forth a flower, in the\ncenter of which is formed the seed vessel, shaped like a bell or\ninverted cone, and punctured on the top with little cavities or\ncells, in which the seeds grow.  The orifices of these cells\nbeing too small to let the seeds drop out when ripe, they shoot\nforth into new plants, in the places where they were formed, the\nbulb of the vessel serving as a matrix to nourish them until they\nacquire such a degree of magnitude as to burst it open and\nrelease themselves, after which, like other aquatic weeds, they\ntake root wherever the current deposits them.  This plant,\ntherefore, being thus productive of itself, and vegetating from\nits own matrix, without being fostered in the earth, was\nnaturally adopted as the symbol of the productive power of the\nwaters, upon which the creative spirit of the Creator operated in\ngiving life and vegetation to matter.  We accordingly find it\nemployed in every part of the Northern hemisphere, where the\nsymbolical religion improperly called idolatry does or did\nprevail.  The sacred images of the Tartars, Japanese, and Indians\nare almost all placed upon it, of which numerous instances occur\nin the publication of Kaempfer, Sonnerat, etc: The Brama of India\nis represented sitting upon a lotus throne, and the figures upon\nthe Isaic table hold the stem of this plant, surmounted by the\nseed vessel in one hand, and the cross representing the male\norgans in the other: thus signifying the universal power, both\nactive and passive, attributed to that goddess.\"[19]",
        "[19] Symbolism of Ancient Art.",
        "The lotus is the most sacred and the most significant symbol\nconnected with the sacred mysteries of the East.  Upon this\nsubject, Maurice observes that there is no plant which has\nreceived such a degree of honor as has the lotus.  It was the\nconsecrated symbol of the Great Mother who had brought forth the\nfecundative energies, female and male.  Not only throughout the\nNorthern hemisphere was it everywhere held in profound\nveneration, but among the modern Egyptians it is still worshipped\nas symbolical of the Great First Cause.  The lotus was the emblem\nvenerated in the solemn celebration of the Mysteries of Eleusis\nin Greece and the Phiditia in Carthage.",
        "In referring to the degree of homage paid to the lotus by the\nancients, Higgins says: “And we shall find in the sequel that it\nstill continues to receive the respect, if not the adoration, of\na great part of the Christian world, unconscious, perhaps, of the\noriginal reason of their conduct.”  It is a significant fact that\nin nearly all the sacred paintings of the Christians in the\ngalleries throughout Europe, especially those of the\nAnnunciation, a lily is always to be observed.  In later ages as\nthe original significance of the lotus was lost, any lily came to\nbe substituted.  Godfrey Higgins is sure that although the\npriests of the Romish Church are at the present time ignorant of\nthe true meaning of the lotus, or lily, “it is, like many other\nvery odd things, probably understood at the Vatican, or the Crypt\nof St. Peter’s.\"[20]",
        "[20] Anacalypsis, book vii., ch. xi.",
        "Of the lotus of the Hindoos Nimrod says:",
        "“The lotus is a well-known allegory, of which the expanse calyx\nrepresents the ships of the gods floating on the surface of the\nwater, and the erect flower arising out of it, the mast thereof .\n.  .  but as the ship was Isis or Magna Mater, the female\nprinciple, and the mast in it the male deity, these parts of the\nflower came to have certain other significations, which seem to\nhave been as well known at Samosata as at Benares.\"[21]",
        "[21] Quoted in Anacalypsis.",
        "In other words it was a phallic emblem and represented the\ncreative processes throughout Nature.  Susa, the name of the\ncapital of the Cushites, or ancient Ethiopians, meant “the City\nof Lilies.”  In India the lotus frequently appears among phallic\ndevices in place of the sacred Yoni.  From the foregoing pages\nthe fact will be observed that the God of the ancients embodied\nthe two creative agencies throughout the universe, but as nothing\ncould exist without a mother, the great Om who was the\nindivisible God and the Creator of the sun was the mother of\nthese two principles, while the Tree of Life was the original\nlife-giving energy upon the earth, represented in the creation\nmyths of the first man Adam, and the first woman Eve or Adama.",
        "Throughout the ages, this force, or creative agency has been\nsymbolized in various ways, many of which have been noted in the\nforegoing pages.  We have observed that notwithstanding the fact\nthat the supremacy of the male had been established, the sacred\nYoni and the lotus were still reverenced as symbols of the most\nexalted God.  Finally, when the masculine energy began to be\nworshipped as the more important agency in reproduction, the\nfemale, although still necessary to complete the god-idea, was\nveiled.",
