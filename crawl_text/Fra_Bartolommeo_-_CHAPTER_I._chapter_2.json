        "It seems to be a law of nature that progress, as well as time, should\nbe marked by periods of alternate light and darkness–day and night.",
        "This law is nowhere more apparent than in the history of Art. Three\ntimes has the world been illuminated by the full brilliance of Art, and\nthree times has a corresponding period of darkness ensued.",
        "The first day dawned in Egypt and Assyria, and its works lie buried in\nthe tombs of prehistoric Pharaohs and Ninevite kings. The second day\nthe sun rose on the shores of many-isled Greece, and shed its rays over\nEtruria and Rome, and ere it set, temples and palaces were flooded with\nbeauty. The gods had taken human form, and were come to dwell with men.",
        "The third day arising in Italy, lit up the whole western world with the\nglow of colour and fervour, and its fading rays light us yet.",
        "The first period was that of mythic art; the world like a child\nwondering at all around tried to express in myths the truths it could\nnot comprehend.",
        "The second was pagan art which satisfies itself that in expressing the\nperfection of humanity, it unfolds divinity. The third era of Christian\nart, conscious that the divine lies beyond the human, fails in aspiring\nto express infinitude.",
        "Tracing one of these periods from its rise, how truly this similitude\nof the dawn of day is carried out. See at the first streak of light how\ndim, stiff, and soulless all things appear! Trees and objects bear\nprecisely the relation to their own appearance in broad daylight as the\nwooden Madonnas of the Byzantine school do to those of Raphael.",
        "Next, when the sun–the true light–first appears, how it bathes the\nsea and the hills in an ethereal glory not their own! What fair liquid\ntints of blue, and rose, and glorious gold! This period which, in art,\nbegan with Giotto and ended with Botticelli, culminated in Fra\nAngelico, who flooded the world of painting with a heavenly\nspiritualism not material, and gave his dreams of heaven the colours of\nthe first pure rays of sunshine.",
        "But as the sun rises, nature takes her real tints gradually. We see\nevery thing in its own colour; the gold and the rose has faded away\nwith the truer light, and a stern realism takes its place. The human\nform must be expressed, in all its solidity and truth, not only in its\noutward semblance, but the hidden soul must be seen through the veil of\nflesh. And in this lies the reason of the decline; only to a few great\nmasters it was given to reveal spirituality in humanity–the others\ncould only emulate form and colour, and failed.",
        "It is impossible to contemplate art apart from religion; as truly as\nthe celestial sun is the revealer of form, so surely is the heavenly\nlight of religion the first inspirer of art.",
        "Where would the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Etruscan paintings and\nsculptures have been but for the veneration of the mystic gods of the\ndead, which both prompted and preserved them?",
        "What would Greek sculpture have been without the deified\npersonifications of the mysterious powers of nature which inspired it?\nand it is the fact of the pagan religion being both sensuous and\nrealistic which explains the perfection of Greek art. The highest ideal\nbeing so low as not to soar beyond the greatest perfection of humanity,\nwas thus within the grasp of the artist to express. Given a manly\nfigure with the fullest development of strength; a female one showing\nthe greatest perfection of form; and a noble man whose features express\ndignity and mental power;–the ideal of a Hercules, a Venus, and a\nJupiter is fully expressed, and the pagan mind satisfied. The spirit of\nadmirers was moved more by beauty of form than by its hidden\nsignificance. In the great Venus, one recognises the woman before\nfeeling the goddess.",
        "As with their sculpture, without doubt it was also with painting. Mr.\nSymonds, in his Renaissance of the Fine Arts, speaks of the\nGreek revival as entirely an age of sculpture; but the solitary glance\ninto the more perishable art of painting among the Greeks, to be seen\nat Cortona, reveals the exquisite perfection to which this branch was\nalso brought. It is a painting in encaustic, and has been used as a\ndoor for his oven by the contadino who dug it up–yet it remains a\nmarvel of genius. The subject is a female head–a muse, or perhaps only\na portrait; the delicacy and mellowness of the flesh tints equal those\nof Raphael or Leonardo, and a lock of hair lying across her breast is\nso exquisitely painted that it seems to move with her breath. The\nfeatures are of the large-eyed regular Greek type, womanly dignity is\nin every line, but it is an essentially pagan face–the Christian soul\nhas never dawned in those eyes! With this before us, we cannot doubt\nthat Greek art found its expression as much in colour as in form and\nthat the same religion inspired both.",
        "In an equal degree Renaissance Art has its roots in Christianity; but\nthe religion is deeper and greater, and has left art behind.",
        "The early Christians must have felt this when they expressed everything\nin symbols, for these are merely suggestive, and allow the imagination\nfull play around and beyond them; they are mere stepping-stones to the\nideal which exists but is as yet inexpressible.",
        "“Myths and symbols always mark the dawn of a religion, incarnation and\nrealism its full growth.” So after a time when the first vague wonder\nand ecstasy are over, symbols no longer content people; they want to\nbring religion home to them in a more tangible form, to humanize it, in\nfact. From this want it arises that nature next to religion inspires\nart, and finally takes its place. For it follows as a matter of course\nthat as art is a realistic interpreter of the spiritual, so it is more\neasy to follow nature than spirituality, nature being the outward or\nrealistic expression of the mind of God.",
        "It was a saying of Buffalmacco, who was not one of the most\ndevout painters of the fourteenth century, “Do not let us think of\nanything but to cover our walls with saints, and out of disrespect to\nthe demons to make men more devout.” And Savonarola, though he has been\naccused of being one of the causes of the decline, thus upheld the\nsacred influences of art; when he exclaimed in one of his fervent\nbursts of eloquence, “You see that Saint there in the Church and say,\n’I will live a good life and be like him.’” If these were the feelings\nof the least devout and the religious fanatic, how hallowed must the\ninfluences of Christian painting have been to the intermediate ranks.\nMr. Symonds beautifully expresses the tendency of that time: “The eyes\nof the worshipper should no longer have a mere stock or stone to\ncontemplate; his imagination should be helped by the dogmatic\npresentation of the scenes of sacred history, and his devotion\nquickened by lively images of the passion of our Lord.... The body and\nsoul moreover should be reconciled, and God’s likeness should be once\nmore acknowledged in the features and limbs of men.” [Footnote:\nSymonds’ Renaissance of the Fine Arts, chap. i. p. 11.]",
        "The school of Giotto was the first to feel this need of the soul. He,\ntaking his ideas from nature, clothed the soul in a thin veil; the\nItalians call his school that of poetic art; it reached sentiment and\npoetry, but did not pass them. Yet the thirteenth century was sublime\nfor the expression of the idea; one only has to study the intense\nmeaning in the works of Giotto, and Orcagna, Duccio, and the Lorenzetti\nof Siena to perceive this. The fourteenth century, on the contrary,\nrendered itself glorious for manifestation of form. “Artists thought\nthe veil of ideality a poor thing, and wished to give the solidity of\nthe body to the soul; they stole every secret from nature; the senses\nwere content, but not sentiment.” [Footnote: Purismo nell’ Arte,\nda Cesare Guasti.]",
        "The artists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, of whom we have\nto speak, blended the two schools, and became perfection as far as they\nwent. Michelangelo drew more from the vigorous thirteenth-century\nmasters, and Raphael from the more sensuous followers of Masaccio and\nLippi. The former tried to put the Christian soul into his works, but\nits infinite depth was unattainable. As his many unfinished works\nprove, he always felt some great overwhelming meaning in his inmost\nsoul, which all his passionate artistic yearnings were inadequate to\nexpress. Raphael tried to bring realism into religion through painting,\nand to give us the scenes of our Lord’s and the Apostles’ lives in such\na humanized aspect, that we should feel ourselves of his nature. But\nthe incarnation of religion in art defeated its own ends; sensuousness\nwas introduced in place of the calm, unearthly spirituality of the\nearlier masters. Compare the cartoon of S. Paul preaching at Athens, in\nwhich he has all the majesty of a Cæsar in the Forum, with the lowly\nspirit of the Apostle’s life! In truth, Raphael failed to approach\nnearer to sublimity than Fra Angelico, with all his faulty drawing but\npure spirit.",
        "After him, artists loved form and colour for themselves rather than for\nthe spiritual meaning. Miss Owen [Footnote: Art Schools of Medieval\nChristendom, edited by Ruskin.] accuses Raphael of having rendered\nArt pagan, but this seems blaming him for the weakness of his\nfollowers, who took for their type his works rather than his ideal. The\ncauses of the decline were many, and are not centred in one man. As\nlong as Religion slumbered in monasticism and dogma, Art seizing on the\nhuman parts, such as the maternity of the Madonna, the personifications\nof saints who had lived in the world, was its adequate exponent. The\nreligion awakened by the aesthetic S. Francis, who loved all kinds of\nbeauty, was of the kind to be fed by pictures. But when Savonarola had\naroused the fervour of the nation to its highest point, when beauty was\nnothing, the world nothing, in comparison to the infinity of God;–then\nart, finding itself powerless to express this overwhelming infinity,\nfell back on more earthly founts of inspiration, the classics and the\npoets.",
        "Lorenzo de’ Medici and Pope Nicholas V. had fully as much to do with\nthe decline as Savonarola. The Pope in Rome, and Lorenzo in Florence,\nled art to the verge of paganism; Savonarola would have kept it on the\nconfines of purism; it was divided and fell, passing through the\nvarious steps of decadence, the mannerists and the eclectics, to rise\nagain in this nineteenth century with what is after all its true aim,\nthe interpretation of nature, and the illustration of the poetry of a\nnation.",
        "But with the decadence we have happily nothing to do; the artists of\nwhom we speak first, Fra Bartolommeo and Albertinelli, belong to the\nculmination of art on its rising side, while Andrea del Sarto stands as\nnear to the greatest artists on the other side, and is the last of the\ngroup before the decline. On Fra Bartolommeo the spirituality of Fra\nAngelico still lingered, while the perfection of Raphael illumined him.\nAndrea del Sarto, on the other side, had gathered into his hands the\ngleams of genius from all the great artists who were his elder\ncontemporaries, and so blending them as to form seemingly a style of\nhis own, distinct from any, has left on our walls and in our galleries\nhundreds of masterpieces of colour, as gay and varied as the tints the\norientals weave into their wondrous fabrics.",
        "It might be said with truth that Fra Bartolommeo painted for the soul,\nand Andrea del Sarto for the eye.",
