        "In spite of its grand feudal air, the chateau at Boiscoran was, after\nall, little more than a bachelor’s modest home, and in a very bad\nstate of preservation. Of the eighty or a hundred rooms which it\ncontained, hardly more than eight or ten were furnished, and this only\nin the simplest possible manner,–a sitting-room, a dining-room, a few\nguest-chambers: this was all M. de Boiscoran required during his rare\nvisits to the place. He himself used in the second story a small room,\nthe door of which opened upon the great staircase.",
        "When they reached this door, guided by old Anthony, the magistrate\nsaid to the servant,–",
        "“Knock!”",
        "The man obeyed: and immediately a youthful, hearty voice replied from\nwithin,–",
        "“Who is there?”",
        "“It is I,” said the faithful servant. “I should like\"–",
        "“Go to the devil!” broke in the voice.",
        "“But, sir\"–",
        "“Let me sleep, rascal. I have not been able to close an eye till now.\"\nThe magistrate, becoming impatient, pushed the servant aside, and,\nseizing the door-knob tried to open it; it was locked inside. But he\nlost no time in saying,–",
        "“It is I, M. de Boiscoran: open, if you please!”",
        "“Ah, dear M. Galpin!” replied the voice cheerfully.",
        "“I must speak to you.”",
        "“And I am at your service, illustrious jurist. Just give me time to\nveil my Apollonian form in a pair of trousers, and I appear.”",
        "Almost immediately, the door opened; and M. de Boiscoran presented\nhimself, his hair dishevelled, his eyes heavy with sleep, but looking\nbright in his youth and full health, with smiling lips and open hands.",
        "“Upon my word!” he said. “That was a happy inspiration you had, my\ndear Galpin. You come to join me at breakfast?”",
        "And, bowing to M. Daubigeon, he added,–",
        "“Not to say how much I thank you for bringing our excellent\ncommonwealth attorney with you. This is a veritable judicial visit\"–",
        "But he paused, chilled as he was by M. Daubigeon’s icy face, and\namazed at M. Galpin’s refusal to take his proffered hand.",
        "“Why,” he said, “what is the matter, my dear friend?”",
        "The magistrate had never been stiffer in his life, when he replied,–",
        "“We shall have to forget our relations, sir. It is not as a friend I\ncome to-day, but as a magistrate.”",
        "M. de Boiscoran looked confounded; but not a shadow of trouble\nappeared on his frank and open face.",
        "“I’ll be hanged,” he said, “if I understand\"–",
        "“Let us go in,” said M. Galpin.",
        "They went in; and, as they passed the door, Mechinet whispered into\nthe attorney’s ear,–",
        "“Sir, that man is certainly innocent. A guilty man would never have\nreceived us thus.”",
        "“Silence, sir!” said the commonwealth attorney, however much he was\nprobably of his clerk’s opinion. “Silence!”",
        "And grave and sad he went and stood in one of the window embrasures.\nM. Galpin remained standing in the centre of the room, trying to see\nevery thing in it, and to fix it in his memory, down to the smallest\ndetails. The prevailing disorder showed clearly how hastily M. de\nBoiscoran had gone to bed the night before. His clothes, his boots,\nhis shirt, his waistcoat, and his straw hat lay scattered about on the\nchairs and on the floor. He wore those light gray trousers, which had\nbeen succcessively seen and recognized by Cocoleu, by Ribot, by\nGaudry, and by Mrs. Courtois.",
        "“Now, sir,” began M. de Boiscoran, with that slight angry tone of\nvoice which shows that a man thinks a joke has been carried far\nenough, “will you please tell me what procures for me the honor of\nthis early visit?”",
        "Not a muscle in M. Galpin’s face was moving. As if the question had\nbeen addressed to some one else, he said coldly,–",
        "“Will you please show us your hands, sir?”",
        "M. de Boiscoran’s cheeks turned crimson; and his eyes assumed an\nexpression of strange perplexity.",
        "“If this is a joke,” he said, “it has perhaps lasted long enough.”",
        "He was evidently getting angry. M. Daubigeon thought it better to\ninterfere, and thus he said,–",
        "“Unfortunately, sir, the question is a most serious one. Do what the\nmagistrate desires.”",
        "More and more amazed, M. de Boiscoran looked rapidly around him. In\nthe door stood Anthony, his faithful old servant, with anguish on his\nface. Near the fireplace, the clerk had improvised a table, and put\nhis paper, his pens, and his horn inkstand in readiness. Then with a\nshrug of his shoulders, which showed that he failed to understand, M.\nde Boiscoran showed his hands.",
        "They were perfectly clean and white: the long nails were carefully\ncleaned also.",
        "“When did you last wash your hands?” asked M. Galpin, after having\nexamined them minutely.",
        "At this question, M. de Boiscoran’s face brightened up; and, breaking\nout into a hearty laugh, he said,–",
        "“Upon my word! I confess you nearly caught me. I was on the point of\ngetting angry. I almost feared\"–",
        "“And there was good reason for fear,” said M. Galpin; “for a terrible\ncharge has been brought against you. And it may be, that on your\nanswer to my question, ridiculous as it seems to you, your honor may\ndepend, and perhaps your liberty.”",
        "This time there was no mistake possible. M. de Boiscoran felt that\nkind of terror which the law inspires even in the best of men, when\nthey find themselves suddenly accused of a crime. He turned pale, and\nthen he said in a troubled voice,–",
        "“What! A charge has been brought against me, and you, M. Galpin, come\nto my house to examine me?”",
        "“I am a magistrate, sir.”",
        "“But you were also my friend. If anyone should have dared in my\npresence to accuse you of a crime, of a mean act, of something\ninfamous, I should have defended you, sir, with all my energy, without\nhesitation, and without a doubt. I should have defended you till\nabsolute, undeniable evidence should have been brought forward of your\nculpability; and even then I should have pitied you, remembering that\nI had esteemed you so highly as to favor your alliance with my family.\nBut you–I am accused, I do not know of what, falsely, wrongly; and at\nonce you hasten hither, you believe the charge, and consent to become\nmy judge. Well, let it be so! I washed my hands last night after\ncoming home.”",
        "M. Galpin had not boasted too much in praising his self-possession and\nhis perfect control over himself. He did not move when the terrible\nwords fell upon his ear; and he asked again in the same calm tone,–",
        "“What has become of the water you used for that purpose?”",
        "“It is probably still there, in my dressing-room.”",
        "The magistrate at once went in. On the marble table stood a basin full\nof water. That water was black and dirty. At the bottom lay particles\nof charcoal. On the top, mixed with the soapsuds, were swimming some\nextremely slight but unmistakable fragments of charred paper. With\ninfinite care the magistrate carried the basin to the table at which\nMechinet had taken a sea; and, pointing at it, he asked M. de\nBoiscoran,–",
        "“Is that the water in which you washed your hands last night after\ncoming home?”",
        "“Yes,” replied the other with an air of careless indifference.",
        "“You had been handling charcoal, or some inflammable material.”",
        "“Don’t you see?”",
        "Standing face to face, the commonwealth attorney and clerk exchanged\nrapid glances. They had had the same feeling at that moment. If M. de\nBoiscoran was innocent, he was certainly a marvellously cool and\nenergetic man, or he was carrying out a long-premeditated plan of\naction; for every one of his answers seemed to tighten the net in\nwhich he was taken. The magistrate himself seemed to be struck by\nthis; but it was only for a moment, and then, turning to the clerk, he\nsaid,–",
        "“Write that down!”",
        "He dictated to him the whole evidence, most minutely and accurately,\ncorrecting himself every now and then to substitute a better word, or\nto improve his style. When he had read it over he said,–",
        "“Let us go on, sir. You were out last night?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“Having left the house at eight, you returned only around midnight.”",
        "“After midnight.”",
        "“You took your gun?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“Where is it?”",
        "With an air of indifference, M. de Boiscoran pointed at it in the\ncorner of the fireplace, and said,–",
        "“There it is!”",
        "M. Galpin took it up quickly. It was a superb weapon, double-\nbarrelled, of unusually fine make, and very elegant. On the\nbeautifully carved woodwork the manufacturer’s name, Clebb, was\nengraven.",
        "“When did you last fire this gun?” asked the magistrate.",
        "“Some four or five days ago.”",
        "“What for?”",
        "“To shoot some rabbits who infested my woods.”",
        "M. Galpin raised and lowered the cock with all possible care: he\nnoticed that it was the Remington patent. Then he opened the chamber,\nand found that the gun was loaded. Each barrel had a cartridge in it.\nThen he put the gun back in its place, and, pulling from his pocket\nthe leaden cartridge-case which Pitard had found, he showed it to M.\nde Boiscoran, and asked him,–",
        "“Do you recognize this?”",
        "“Perfectly!” replied the other. “It is a case of one of the cartridges\nwhich I have probably thrown away as useless.”",
        "“Do you think you are the only one in this country who has a gun by\nthis maker?”",
        "“I do not think it: I am quite sure of it.”",
        "“So that you must, as a matter of course, have been at a spot where\nsuch a cartridge-case as this has been found?”",
        "“Not necessarily. I have often seen children pick up these things, and\nplay with them.”",
        "The clerk, while he made his pen fly across his paper, could not\nresist the temptation of making all kinds of faces. He was too well\nacquainted with lawyers’ tactics not to understand M. Galpin’s policy\nperfectly well, and to see how cunningly it was devised to make every\nfact strengthen the suspicion against M. de Boiscoran.",
        "“It is a close game,” he said to himself.",
        "The magistrate had taken a seat.",
        "“If that is so,” he began again, “I beg you will give me an account of\nhow you spent the evening after eight o’clock: do not hurry, consider,\ntake your time; for your answers are of the utmost importance.”",
        "M. de Boiscoran had so far remained quite cool; but his calmness\nbetrayed one of those terrible storms within, which may break forth,\nno one knows when. This warning, and, even more so, the tone in which\nit was given, revolted him as a most hideous hypocrisy. And, breaking\nout all of a sudden, he cried,–",
        "“After all, sir, what do you want of me? What am I accused of?”",
        "M. Galpin did not stir. He replied,–",
        "“You will hear it at the proper time. First answer my question, and\nbelieve me in your own interest. Answer frankly. What did you do last\nnight?”",
        "“How do I know? I walked about.”",
        "“That is no answer.”",
        "“Still it is so. I went out with no specific purpose: I walked at\nhaphazard.”",
        "“Your gun on your shoulder?”",
        "“I always take my gun: my servant can tell you so.”",
        "“Did you cross the Seille marshes?”",
        "“No.”",
        "The magistrate shook his head gravely. He said,–",
        "“You are not telling the truth.”",
        "“Sir!”",
        "“Your boots there at the foot of the bed speak against you. Where does\nthe mud come from with which they are covered?”",
        "“The meadows around Boiscoran are very wet.”",
        "“Do not attempt to deny it. You have been seen there.”",
        "“But\"–",
        "“Young Ribot met you at the moment when you were crossing the canal.”",
        "M. de Boiscoran made no reply.",
        "“Where were you going?” asked the magistrate.",
        "For the first time a real embarrassment appeared in the features of\nthe accused,–the embarrassment of a man who suddenly sees an abyss\nopening before him. He hesitated; and, seeing that it was useless to\ndeny, he said,–",
        "“I was going to Brechy.”",
        "“To whom?”",
        "“To my wood-merchant, who has bought all this year’s wood. I did not\nfind him at home, and came back on the high road.”",
        "M. Galpin stopped him by a gesture.",
        "“That is not so,” he said severely.",
        "“Oh!”",
        "“You never went to Brechy.”",
        "“I beg your pardon.”",
        "“And the proof is, that, about eleven o’clock, you were hurriedly\ncrossing the forest of Rochepommier.”",
        "“I?”",
        "“Yes, you! And do not say No; for there are your trousers torn to\npieces by the thorns and briers through which you must have made your\nway.”",
        "“There are briers elsewhere as well as in the forest.”",
        "“To be sure; but you were seen there.”",
        "“By whom?”",
        "“By Gaudry the poacher. And he saw so much of you, that he could tell\nus in what a bad humor you were. You were very angry. You were talking\nloud, and pulling the leaves from the trees.”",
        "As he said so, the magistrate got up and took the shooting-jacket,\nwhich was lying on a chair not far from him. He searched the pockets,\nand pulled out of one a handful of leaves.",
        "“Look here! you see, Gaudry has told the truth.”",
        "“There are leaves everywhere,” said M. de Boiscoran half aloud.",
        "“Yes; but a woman, Mrs. Courtois, saw you come out of the forest of\nRochepommier. You helped her to put a sack of flour on her ass, which\nshe could not lift alone. Do you deny it? No, you are right; for, look\nhere! on the sleeve of your coat I see something white, which, no\ndoubt, is flour from her bag.”",
        "M. de Boiscoran hung his head. The magistrate went on,–",
        "“You confess, then, that last night, between ten and eleven you were\nat Valpinson?”",
        "“No, sir, I do not.”",
        "“But this cartridge-case which I have just shown you was picked up at\nValpinson, close by the ruins of the old castle.”",
        "“Well, sir, have I not told you before that I have seen a hundred\ntimes children pick up these cases to play with? Besides, if I had\nreally been at Valpinson, why should I deny it?”",
        "M. Galpin rose to his full height, and said in the most solemn\nmanner,–",
        "“I am going to tell you why! Last night, between ten and eleven,\nValpinson was set on fire; and it has been burnt to the ground.”",
        "“Oh!”",
        "“Last night Count Claudieuse was fired at twice.”",
        "“Great God!”",
        "“And it is thought, in fact there are strong reasons to think, that\nyou, Jacques de Boiscoran, are the incendiary and the assassin.”",
