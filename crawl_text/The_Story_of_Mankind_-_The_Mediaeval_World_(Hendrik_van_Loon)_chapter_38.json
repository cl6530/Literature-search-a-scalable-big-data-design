        "WHAT THE PEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE AGES\nTHOUGHT OF THE WORLD IN WHICH\nTHEY HAPPENED TO LIVE",
        "DATES are a very useful invention. We could not do without\nthem but unless we are very careful, they will play tricks\nwith us. They are apt to make history too precise. For example,\nwhen I talk of the point-of-view of mediaeval man, I\ndo not mean that on the 31st of December of the year 476,\nsuddenly all the people of Europe said, “Ah, now the Roman\nEmpire has come to an end and we are living in the Middle\nAges. How interesting!”",
        "You could have found men at the Frankish court of Charlemagne\nwho were Romans in their habits, in their manners, in\ntheir out-look upon life. On the other hand, when you grow\nup you will discover that some of the people in this world have\nnever passed beyond the stage of the cave-man. All times\nand all ages overlap, and the ideas of succeeding generations\nplay tag with each other. But it is possible to study the minds\nof a good many true representatives of the Middle Ages and\nthen give you an idea of the average man’s attitude toward\nlife and the many difficult problems of living.",
        "First of all, remember that the people of the Middle Ages\nnever thought of themselves as free-born citizens, who could\ncome and go at will and shape their fate according to their\nability or energy or luck. On the contrary, they all considered\nthemselves part of the general scheme of things, which included\nemperors and serfs, popes and heretics, heroes and swashbucklers,\nrich men, poor men, beggar men and thieves. They accepted\nthis divine ordinance and asked no questions. In this,\nof course, they differed radically from modern people who accept\nnothing and who are forever trying to improve their own\nfinancial and political situation.",
        "To the man and woman of the thirteenth century, the world\nhereafter–a Heaven of wonderful delights and a Hell of brimstone\nand suffering–meant something more than empty words\nor vague theological phrases. It was an actual fact and the\nmediaeval burghers and knights spent the greater part of their\ntime preparing for it. We modern people regard a noble\ndeath after a well-spent life with the quiet calm of the ancient\nGreeks and Romans. After three score years of work and effort,\nwe go to sleep with the feeling that all will be well.",
        "But during the Middle Ages, the King of Terrors with\nhis grinning skull and his rattling bones was man’s steady\ncompanion. He woke his victims up with terrible tunes on his\nscratchy fiddle he sat down with them at dinner–he smiled\nat them from behind trees and shrubs when they took a girl\nout for a walk. If you had heard nothing but hair-raising\nyarns about cemeteries and coffins and fearful diseases when\nyou were very young, instead of listening to the fairy stories\nof Anderson and Grimm, you, too, would have lived all your\ndays in a dread of the final hour and the gruesome day of\nJudgment. That is exactly what happened to the children of\nthe Middle Ages. They moved in a world of devils and spooks\nand only a few occasional angels. Sometimes, their fear of\nthe future filled their souls with humility and piety, but often\nit influenced them the other way and made them cruel and\nsentimental. They would first of all murder all the women\nand children of a captured city and then they would devoutly\nmarch to a holy spot and with their hands gory with the blood\nof innocent victims, they would pray that a merciful heaven forgive\nthem their sins. Yea, they would do more than pray, they\nwould weep bitter tears and would confess themselves the most\nwicked of sinners. But the next day, they would once more\nbutcher a camp of Saracen enemies without a spark of mercy\nin their hearts.",
        "Of course, the Crusaders were Knights and obeyed a somewhat\ndifferent code of manners from the common men. But in\nsuch respects the common man was just the same as his master.\nHe, too, resembled a shy horse, easily frightened by a\nshadow or a silly piece of paper, capable of excellent and faithful\nservice but liable to run away and do terrible damage when\nhis feverish imagination saw a ghost.",
        "In judging these good people, however, it is wise to remember\nthe terrible disadvantages under which they lived.\nThey were really barbarians who posed as civilised people.\nCharlemagne and Otto the Great were called “Roman Emperors,\"\nbut they had as little resemblance to a real Roman Emperor\n(say Augustus or Marcus Aurelius) as “King” Wumba\nWumba of the upper Congo has to the highly educated rulers\nof Sweden or Denmark. They were savages who lived amidst\nglorious ruins but who did not share the benefits of the\ncivilisation which their fathers and grandfathers had destroyed.\nThey knew nothing. They were ignorant of almost every fact\nwhich a boy of twelve knows to-day. They were obliged to go\nto one single book for all their information. That was the\nBible. But those parts of the Bible which have influenced the\nhistory of the human race for the better are those chapters of\nthe New Testament which teach us the great moral lessons of\nlove, charity and forgiveness. As a handbook of astronomy,\nzoology, botany, geometry and all the other sciences, the venerable\nbook is not entirely reliable. In the twelfth century, a\nsecond book was added to the mediaeval library, the great\nencyclopaedia of useful knowledge, compiled by Aristotle, the\nGreek philosopher of the fourth century before Christ. Why\nthe Christian church should have been willing to accord such\nhigh honors to the teacher of Alexander the Great, whereas\nthey condemned all other Greek philosophers on account of\ntheir heathenish doctrines, I really do not know. But next to\nthe Bible, Aristotle was recognized as the only reliable teacher\nwhose works could be safely placed into the hands of true\nChristians.",
        "His works had reached Europe in a somewhat roundabout\nway. They had gone from Greece to Alexandria. They had\nthen been translated from the Greek into the Arabic language\nby the Mohammedans who conquered Egypt in the seventh\ncentury. They had followed the Moslem armies into Spain and\nthe philosophy of the great Stagirite (Aristotle was a native of\nStagira in Macedonia) was taught in the Moorish universities\nof Cordova. The Arabic text was then translated into Latin\nby the Christian students who had crossed the Pyrenees to get\na liberal education and this much travelled version of the famous\nbooks was at last taught at the different schools of northwestern\nEurope. It was not very clear, but that made it all\nthe more interesting.",
        "With the help of the Bible and Aristotle, the most brilliant\nmen of the Middle Ages now set to work to explain all things\nbetween Heaven and Earth in their relation to the expressed\nwill of God. These brilliant men, the so-called Scholasts or\nSchoolmen, were really very intelligent, but they had obtained\ntheir information exclusively from books, and never from actual\nobservation. If they wanted to lecture on the sturgeon\nor on caterpillars, they read the Old and New Testaments and\nAristotle, and told their students everything these good books\nhad to say upon the subject of caterpillars and sturgeons.\nThey did not go out to the nearest river to catch a sturgeon.\nThey did not leave their libraries and repair to the backyard\nto catch a few caterpillars and look at these animals and study\nthem in their native haunts. Even such famous scholars as\nAlbertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas did not inquire whether\nthe sturgeons in the land of Palestine and the caterpillars of\nMacedonia might not have been different from the sturgeons\nand the caterpillars of western Europe.",
        "When occasionally an exceptionally curious person like\nRoger Bacon appeared in the council of the learned and began\nto experiment with magnifying glasses and funny little telescopes\nand actually dragged the sturgen and the caterpillar\ninto the lecturing room and proved that they were different\nfrom the creatures described by the Old Testament and by\nAristotle, the Schoolmen shook their dignified heads. Bacon\nwas going too far. When he dared to suggest that an hour\nof actual observation was worth more than ten years with\nAristotle and that the works of that famous Greek might as\nwell have remained untranslated for all the good they had ever\ndone, the scholasts went to the police and said, “This man is\na danger to the safety of the state. He wants us to study\nGreek that we may read Aristotle in the original. Why should\nhe not be contented with our Latin-Arabic translation which\nhas satisfied our faithful people for so many hundred years?\nWhy is he so curious about the insides of fishes and the insides\nof insects? He is probably a wicked magician trying to upset\nthe established order of things by his Black Magic.” And so\nwell did they plead their cause that the frightened guardians\nof the peace forbade Bacon to write a single word for more\nthan ten years. When he resumed his studies he had learned\na lesson. He wrote his books in a queer cipher which made it\nimpossible for his contemporaries to read them, a trick which\nbecame common as the Church became more desperate in its\nattempts to prevent people from asking questions which would\nlead to doubts and infidelity.",
        "This, however, was not done out of any wicked desire to\nkeep people ignorant. The feeling which prompted the heretic\nhunters of that day was really a very kindly one. They firmly\nbelieved–nay, they knew–that this life was but the preparation\nfor our real existence in the next world. They felt convinced\nthat too much knowledge made people uncomfortable,\nfilled their minds with dangerous opinions and led to doubt\nand hence to perdition. A mediaeval Schoolman who saw one\nof his pupils stray away from the revealed authority of the\nBible and Aristotle, that he might study things for himself, felt\nas uncomfortable as a loving mother who sees her young child\napproach a hot stove. She knows that he will burn his little\nfingers if he is allowed to touch it and she tries to keep him\nback, if necessary she will use force. But she really loves\nthe child and if he will only obey her, she will be as good to him\nas she possibly can be. In the same way the mediaeval guardians\nof people’s souls, while they were strict in all matters\npertaining to the Faith, slaved day and night to render the\ngreatest possible service to the members of their flock. They\nheld out a helping hand whenever they could and the society\nof that day shows the influence of thousands of good men and\npious women who tried to make the fate of the average mortal\nas bearable as possible.",
        "A serf was a serf and his position would never change. But\nthe Good Lord of the Middle Ages who allowed the serf to\nremain a slave all his life had bestowed an immortal soul upon\nthis humble creature and therefore he must be protected in his\nrights, that he might live and die as a good Christian. When\nhe grew too old or too weak to work he must be taken care\nof by the feudal master for whom he had worked. The serf,\ntherefore, who led a monotonous and dreary life, was never\nhaunted by fear of to-morrow. He knew that he was “safe\"–\nthat he could not be thrown out of employment, that he would\nalways have a roof over his head (a leaky roof, perhaps, but\nroof all the same), and that he would always have something\nto eat.",
        "This feeling of “stability” and of “safety” was found in all\nclasses of society. In the towns the merchants and the artisans\nestablished guilds which assured every member of a steady income.\nIt did not encourage the ambitious to do better than\ntheir neighbours. Too often the guilds gave protection to\nthe “slacker” who managed to “get by.” But they established\na general feeling of content and assurance among the\nlabouring classes which no longer exists in our day of general\ncompetition. The Middle Ages were familiar with the dangers\nof what we modern people call “corners,” when a single rich\nman gets hold of all the available grain or soap or pickled\nherring, and then forces the world to buy from him at his own\nprice. The authorities, therefore, discouraged wholesale trading\nand regulated the price at which merchants were allowed\nto sell their goods.",
        "The Middle Ages disliked competition. Why compete and\nfill the world with hurry and rivalry and a multitude of pushing\nmen, when the Day of Judgement was near at hand, when\nriches would count for nothing and when the good serf would\nenter the golden gates of Heaven while the bad knight was\nsent to do penance in the deepest pit of Inferno?",
        "In short, the people of the Middle Ages were asked to surrender\npart of their liberty of thought and action, that they\nmight enjoy greater safety from poverty of the body and poverty\nof the soul.",
        "And with a very few exceptions, they did not object. They\nfirmly believed that they were mere visitors upon this planet–\nthat they were here to be prepared for a greater and more\nimportant life. Deliberately they turned their backs upon a\nworld which was filled with suffering and wickedness and\ninjustice. They pulled down the blinds that the rays of the\nsun might not distract their attention from that chapter in the\nApocalypse which told them of that heavenly light which was\nto illumine their happiness in all eternity. They tried to close\ntheir eyes to most of the joys of the world in which they lived\nthat they might enjoy those which awaited them in the near\nfuture. They accepted life as a necessary evil and welcomed\ndeath as the beginning of a glorious day.",
        "The Greeks and the Romans had never bothered about the\nfuture but had tried to establish their Paradise right here upon\nthis earth. They had succeeded in making life extremely pleasant\nfor those of their fellow men who did not happen to be\nslaves. Then came the other extreme of the Middle Ages,\nwhen man built himself a Paradise beyond the highest clouds\nand turned this world into a vale of tears for high and low,\nfor rich and poor, for the intelligent and the dumb. It was\ntime for the pendulum to swing back in the other direction, as\nI shall tell you in my next chapter.",
