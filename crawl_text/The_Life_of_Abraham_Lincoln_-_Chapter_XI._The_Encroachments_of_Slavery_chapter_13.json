        "It is necessary at this point to take a glance at the history of\nAmerican slavery, in order to understand Lincoln’s career. In 1619, or\none year before the landing of the Mayflower at Plymouth, a Dutch\nman-of-war landed a cargo of slaves at Jamestown, Virginia. For nearly\ntwo centuries after this the slave trade was more or less brisk. The\nslaves were distributed, though unevenly, over all the colonies. But as\ntime passed, differences appeared. In the North, the public conscience\nwas awake to the injustice of the institution, while in the South it\nwas not. There were many exceptions in both localities, but the public\nsentiment, the general feeling, was as stated.",
        "There was another difference. Slave labor was more valuable in the\nSouth than in the North. This was due to the climate. The negro does\nnot take kindly to the rigors of the North, while in the South the\nheat, which is excessive to the white man, is precisely suited to the\nnegro. In the course of years, therefore, there came to be\ncomparatively few negroes in the North while large numbers were found\nin the South.",
        "It is generally conceded that the founders of our government looked\nforward to a gradual extinction of slavery. In the first draft of the\nDeclaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson inserted some scathing\nremarks about the King’s part in the slave traffic. But it was felt\nthat such remarks would come with ill grace from colonies that abetted\nslavery, and the passage was stricken out. It was, however, provided\nthat the slave trade should cease in the year 1808.",
        "The Ordinance of 1787 recognized the difference in sentiment of the two\nportions of the country on the subject, and was enacted as a\ncompromise. Like several subsequent enactments, it was supposed to set\nthe agitation of the subject for ever at rest. This ordinance provided\nthat slavery should be excluded from the northwestern territory. At\nthat time the Mississippi river formed the western boundary of the\ncountry, and the territory thus ordained to be free was that out of\nwhich the five states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and\nWisconsin were subsequently formed. It was not then dreamed that the\nfuture acquisition of new territory, or the sudden appreciation of the\nvalue of the slave, would reopen the question.",
        "But three facts changed the entire complexion of the subject. It was\ndiscovered that the soil and climate of the South were remarkably well\nadapted to the growth of cotton. Then the development of steam power\nand machinery in the manufacture of cotton goods created a sudden and\nenormous demand from Liverpool, Manchester, and other cities in England\nfor American cotton. There remained an obstacle to the supply of this\ndemand. This was the difficulty of separating the cotton fiber from the\nseed. A negro woman was able to clean about a pound of cotton in a day.",
        "In 1793, Eli Whitney, a graduate of Yale college, was teaching school\nin Georgia, and boarding with the widow of General Greene. Certain\nplanters were complaining, in the hearing of Mrs. Greene, of the\ndifficulty of cleaning cotton, when she declared that the Yankee school\nteacher could solve the difficulty, that he was so ingenious that there\nwas almost nothing he could not do.",
        "The matter was brought to Whitney’s attention, who protested that he\nknew nothing of the subject,–he hardly knew a cotton seed when he saw\nit. Nevertheless he set to work and invented the cotton gin. By this\nmachine one man, turning a crank; could clean fifty pounds of cotton a\nday. The effect of this was to put a new face upon the cotton trade. It\nenabled the planters to meet the rapidly-increasing demand for raw\ncotton.",
        "It had an equal influence on the slavery question. Only negroes can\nwork successfully in the cotton fields. There was a phenomenal increase\nin the demand for negro labor. And this was fifteen years before the\ntime limit of the slave trade in 1808.",
        "There soon came to be a decided jealousy between the slave-holding and\nthe non-slave-holding portion of the country which continually\nincreased. At the time of the Ordinance of 1787 the two parts of the\ncountry, were about evenly balanced. Each section kept a vigilant watch\nof the other section so as to avoid losing the balance of power.",
        "As the country enlarged, this balance was preserved by the admission of\nfree and slave states in turn. Vermont was paired with Kentucky;\nTennessee with Ohio; Louisiana with Indiana; and Mississippi with\nIllinois. In 1836, Michigan and Arkansas were admitted on the same day.\non the same day. This indicates that the jealousy of the two parties\nwas growing more acute.",
        "Then Texas was admitted December 29, 1845, and was not balanced until\nthe admission of Wisconsin in 1848.",
        "We must now go back to the admission of Missouri. It came into the\nUnion as a slave state, but by what is known as the Missouri Compromise\nof 1820. By this compromise the concession of slavery to Missouri was\noffset by the enactment that all slavery should be forever excluded\nfrom the territory west of that state and north of its southern\nboundary: namely, the parallel of 36 degrees 30’.",
        "The mutterings of the conflict were heard at the time of the admission\nof Texas in 1848. It was again “set forever at rest” by what was known\nas the Wilmot proviso. A year or two later, the discovery of gold in\nCalifornia and the acquisition of New Mexico reopened the whole\nquestion. Henry Clay of Kentucky, a slaveholder but opposed to the\nextension of slavery, was then a member of the House. By a series of\ncompromises–he had a brilliant talent for compromise–he once more set\nthe whole question “forever at rest.” This rest lasted for four years.\nBut in 1852 Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe published “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,\"\nan event of national importance. To a degree unprecedented, it roused\nthe conscience of those who were opposed to slavery and inflamed the\nwrath of those who favored it.",
        "The sudden and rude awakening from this rest came in 1854 with the\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise. The overland travel to California\nafter the year 1848 had given to the intervening territory an\nimportance far in excess of its actual population. It early became\ndesirable to admit into the Union both Kansas and Nebraska; and the\nquestion arose whether slavery should be excluded according to the act\nof 1820. The slave-holding residents of Missouri were hostile to the\nexclusion of slavery. It was situated just beyond their border, and\nthere is no wonder that they were unable to see any good reason why\nthey could not settle there with their slaves. They had the sympathy of\nthe slave states generally.",
        "On the other hand, the free states were bitterly opposed to extending\nthe slave power. To them it seemed that the slaveholders were planning\nfor a vast empire of slavery, an empire which should include not only\nthe southern half of the United States, but also Mexico, Central\nAmerica, and possibly a portion of South America. The advocates of\nslavery certainly presented and maintained an imperious and despotic\ntemper. Feeling was running high on both sides in the early fifties.",
        "A leading cyclopedia concludes a brief article on the Missouri\nCompromise with the parenthetical reference,–\"see DOUGLAS, STEPHEN A.\"\nThe implication contained in these words is fully warranted. The chief\nevent in the life of Douglas is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.\nAnd the history of the Missouri Compromise cannot be written without\ngiving large place to the activity of Douglas. His previous utterances\nhad not led observers, however watchful, to suspect this. In the\ncompromise of 1850 he had spoken with great emphasis: “In taking leave\nof this subject, I wish to state that I have determined never to make\nanother speech upon the slavery question.... We claim that the\ncompromise is a final settlement.... Those who preach peace should not\nbe the first to commence and reopen an old quarrel.”",
        "This was the man who four years later recommenced and reopened this old\nquarrel of slavery. In the meantime something had occurred. In 1852 he\nhad been the unsuccessful candidate for the democratic nomination for\nPresident, and he had aspirations for the nomination in 1856, when a\nnomination would have been equivalent to an election. It thus seemed\npolitic for him to make some decided move which would secure to him the\nloyalty of the slave power.",
        "Upon Stephen A. Douglas rested the responsibility of the repeal of the\nMissouri Compromise. He was at that time chairman of the Senate\ncommittee on Territories. His personal friend and political manager for\nIllinois, William A. Richardson, held a similar position in the House.\nThe control of the legislation upon this subject was then absolutely in\nthe hands of Senator Douglas, the man who had “determined never to make\nanother speech on the slavery question.”",
        "It is not within the scope of this book to go into the details of this\niniquitous plot, for plot it was. But the following passage may be\nquoted as exhibiting the method of the bill: “It being the true intent\nand meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or\nstate, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof\nperfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in\ntheir own way, subject only to the Constitution.” In other words, no\nstate or territory could be surely safe from the intrusion of slavery.",
        "Lincoln had been practising law and had been out of politics for six\nyears. It was this bill which called him back to politics, “like a\nfire-bell in the night.”",
