        "In the very heart of the Gaonate, the eighth century witnessed a\nreligious and literary reaction against Rabbinism. The opposition to the\nRabbinite spirit was far older than this, but it came to a head under\nAnan, the son of David, the founder of Karaism. Anan had been an\nunsuccessful candidate for the dignity of Exilarch, and thus personal\nmotives were involved in his attack on the Gaonim. But there were other\nreasons for the revolt. In the same century, Islam, like Judaism, was\nthreatened by a fierce antagonism between the friends and the foes of\ntradition. In Islam the struggle lay between the Sunnites, who\ninterpreted Mohammedanism in accordance with authorized tradition, and\nthe Shiites, who relied exclusively upon the Koran. Similarly, in\nJudaism, the Rabbinites obeyed the traditions of the earlier\nauthorities, and the Karaites (from Kera, or Mikra, i.e. “Bible”)\nclaimed the right to reject tradition and revert to the Bible as the\noriginal source of inspiration. Such reactions against tradition are\nrecurrent in all religions.",
        "Karaism, however, was not a true reaction against tradition. It replaced\nan old tradition by a new one; it substituted a rigid, unprogressive\nauthority for one capable of growth and adaptation to changing\nrequirements. In the end, Karaism became so hedged in by its supposed\navoidance of tradition that it ceased to be a living force. But we are\nhere not concerned with the religious defects of Karaism. Regarded from\nthe literary side, Karaism produced a double effect. Karaism itself gave\nbirth to an original and splendid literature, and, on the other hand,\ncoming as it did at the time when Arabic science and poetry were\nattaining their golden zenith, Karaism aroused within the Rabbinite\nsphere a notable energy, which resulted in some of the best work of\nmedieval Jews.",
        "Among the most famous of the Karaite authors was Benjamin Nahavendi, who\nlived at the beginning of the ninth century, and displayed much\nresolution and ability as an advocate of free-thought in religion.\nNahavendi not only wrote commentaries on the Bible, but also attempted\nto write a philosophy of Judaism, being allied to Philo in the past and\nto the Arabic writers in his own time. At the end of the ninth century,\nAbul-Faraj Harun made a great stride forwards as an expounder of the\nBible and as an authority on Hebrew grammar.",
        "During the ninth and tenth centuries, several Karaites revealed much\nvigor and ability in their controversies with the Gaonim. In this field\nthe most distinguished Karaitic writers were Salman, the son of Yerucham\n(885-960); Sahal, the son of Mazliach (900-950); Joseph al-Bazir\n(flourished 910-930); Hassan, the son of Mashiach (930); and Japhet, the\nson of Ali (950-990).",
        "Salman, the son of Yerucham, was an active traveller; born in Egypt, he\nwent as a young man to Jerusalem, which he made his head-quarters for\nseveral years, though he paid occasional visits to Babylonia and to his\nnative land. These journeys helped to unify the scattered Karaite\ncommunities. Besides his Biblical works, Salman composed a poetical\ntreatise against the Rabbinite theories. To this book, which was written\nin Hebrew, Salman gave the title, “The Wars of the Lord.”",
        "Sahal, the son of Mazliach, on the other hand, was a native of the Holy\nLand, and though an eager polemical writer against the Rabbinites, he\nbore a smaller part than Salman in the practical development of Karaism.\nHis “Hebrew Grammar” (Sefer Dikduk) and his Lexicon (Leshon\nLimmudim) were very popular. Unlike the work of other Karaites, Joseph\nal-Bazir’s writings were philosophical, and had no philological value.\nHe was an adherent of the Mohammedan theological method known as the\nKalam, and wrote mostly in Arabic. Another Karaite of the same period,\nHassan, the son of Mashiach, was the one who impelled Saadiah to throw\noff all reserves and enter the lists as a champion of Rabbinism. Of the\nremaining Karaites of the tenth century, the foremost was Japhet, the\nson of Ali, whose commentaries on the Bible represent the highest\nachievements of Karaism. A large Hebrew dictionary (Iggaron), by a\ncontemporary of Japhet named David, the son of Abraham, is also a work\nwhich was often quoted. Kirkisani, also a tenth century Karaite,\ncompleted in the year 937 a treatise called, “The Book of Lights and the\nHigh Beacons.” In this work much valuable information is supplied as to\nthe history of Karaism. Despite his natural prejudices in favor of his\nown sect, Kirkisani is a faithful historian, as frank regarding the\ninternal dissensions of the Karaites as in depicting the divergence of\nviews among the Rabbinites. Kirkisani’s work is thus of the greatest\nimportance for the history of Jewish sects.",
        "Finally, the famous Karaite Judah Hadassi (1075-1160) was a young man\nwhen his native Jerusalem was stormed by the Crusaders in 1099. A\nwanderer to Constantinople, he devoted himself to science, Hebrew\nphilology, and Greek literature. He utilized his wide knowledge in his\ngreat work, “A Cluster of Cyprus Flowers” (Eshkol ha-Kopher), which\nwas completed in 1150. It is written in a series of rhymed alphabetical\nacrostics. It is encyclopedic in range, and treats critically, not only\nof Judaism, but also of Christianity and Islam.",
        "Karaitic literature was produced in later centuries also, but by the end\nof the twelfth century, Karaism had exhausted its originality and\nfertility. One much later product of Karaism, however, deserves special\nmention. Isaac Troki composed, in 1593, a work entitled “The\nStrengthening of Faith” (Chizzuk Emunah), in which the author defended\nJudaism and attacked Christianity. It was a lucid book, and as its\narguments were popularly arranged, it was very much read and used. With\nthis exception, Karaism produced no important work after the twelfth\ncentury.",
        "On the intellectual side, therefore, Karaism was a powerful though\nephemeral movement. In several branches of science and philology the\nKaraites made real additions to contemporary knowledge. But the main\nservice of Karaism was indirect. The Rabbinite Jews, who represented the\nmass of the people, had been on the way to a scientific and\nphilosophical development of their own before the rise of Karaism. The\nnecessity of fighting Karaism with its own weapons gave a strong impetus\nto the new movement in Rabbinism, and some of the best work of Saadiah\nwas inspired by Karaitic opposition. Before, however, we turn to the\ncareer of Saadiah, we must consider another literary movement, which\ncoincided in date with the rise of Karaism, but was entirely independent\nof it.",
