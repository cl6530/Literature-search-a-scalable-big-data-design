        "[An accident and a month’s rest.] I sprained my foot so badly in\nascending Mayon that I was obliged to keep the house for a month. Under\nthe circumstances, I was not sorry to find myself settled in a roomy\nand comfortable dwelling. My house was built upon the banks of a\nsmall stream, and stood in the middle of a garden in which coffee,\ncacao, oranges, papayas, and bananas grew luxuriantly, in spite of\nthe tall weeds which surrounded them. Several over-ripe berries had\nfallen to the ground, and I had them collected, roasted, mixed with\nan equal quantity of sugar, and made into chocolate; an art in which\nthe natives greatly excel. With the Spaniards chocolate takes the\nplace of coffee and tea, and even the mestizos and the well-to-do\nnatives drink a great deal of it.",
        "[Cacao] The cacao-tree comes from Central America. It flourishes\nthere between the 23rd parallel north and the 20th south latitude;\nbut it is only at its best in the hottest and dampest climates. In\ntemperate climates, where the thermometer marks less than 23° C.,\nit produces no fruit.",
        "[High quality.] It was first imported into the Philippines from\nAcapulco; either, according to Camarines, by a pilot called Pedro\nBrabo de Lagunas, in 1670; or, according to Samar, by some Jesuits,\nduring Salcedo’s government, between 1663 and 1668. Since then\nit has spread over the greater part of the Island; and, although\nit is not cultivated with any excessive care, its fruit is of\nexcellent quality. The cacao of Albay, if its cheapness be taken into\nconsideration, may be considered at least equal to that of Caracas,\nwhich is so highly-prized in Europe, and which, on account of its\nhigh price, generally is largely mixed with inferior kinds. [74]\nThe bushes are usually found in small gardens, close to the houses;\nbut so great is the native laziness that frequently the berries are\nallowed to decay, although the local cacao sells for a higher price\nthan the imported. At Cebu and Negros a little more attention is paid\nto its cultivation; [Scanty production.] but it does not suffice to\nsupply the wants of the colony, which imports the deficiency from\nTernate and Mindanao. The best cacao of the Philippines is produced in\nthe small Island of Maripipi, which lies to the north-west of Leyte;\nand it is difficult to obtain, the entire crop generally being long\nbespoke. It costs about one dollar per liter, whereas the Albay cacao\ncosts from two to two and a half dollars per “ganta” (three liters).",
        "[Culture.] The natives generally cover the kernels, just as they\nare beginning to sprout, with a little earth, and, placing them\nin a spirally-rolled leaf, hang them up beneath the roof of their\ndwellings. They grow very rapidly, and, to prevent their being\nchoked by weeds, are planted out at very short intervals. This\nmethod of treatment is probably the reason that the cacao-trees in\nthe Philippines never attain a greater height than eight or ten feet,\nwhile in their native soil they frequently reach thirty, and sometimes\neven forty feet. The tree begins to bear fruit in its third or fourth\nyear, and in its fifth or sixth it reaches maturity, when it usually\nyields a “ganta” of cacao, which, as I have mentioned, is worth from\ntwo to two and a half dollars, and always finds a purchaser. [75]",
        "[Neglect.] The profits arising from a large plantation would,\ntherefore, be considerable; yet it is very rare to meet with one. I\nheard it said that the Economical Society had offered a considerable\nreward to any one who could exhibit a plantation of ten thousand\nberry-bearing trees; but in the Society’s report I found no mention\nof this reward.",
        "[Damage by storms.] The great obstacles in the way of large plantations\nare the heavy storms which recur almost regularly every year,\nand often destroy an entire plantation in a single day. In 1856 a\nhurricane visited the Island just before the harvest, and completely\ntore up several large plantations by the roots; a catastrophe that\nnaturally has caused much discouragement to the cultivators. [76]\nOne consequence of this state of things was that the free importation\nof cacao was permitted, and people were enabled to purchase Guayaqual\ncacao at fifteen dollars per quintal while that grown at home cost\ndouble the money.",
        "[Diseases and pests.] The plant is sometimes attacked by a disease,\nthe origin of which is unknown, when it suffers severely from certain\nnoxious insects. [77] It is also attacked by rats and other predatory\nvermin; the former sometimes falling upon it in such numbers that\nthey destroy the entire harvest in a single night. Travellers in\nAmerica say that a well-kept cacao plantation is a very picturesque\nsight. In the Philippines, however, or at any rate in East Luzon,\nthe closely-packed, lifeless-looking, moss-covered trees present a\ndreary spectacle. Their existence is a brief one. Their oval leaves,\nsometimes nearly a foot long, droop singly from the twigs, and form\nno luxuriant masses of foliage. Their blossoms are very insignificant;\nthey are of a reddish-yellow, no larger than the flowers of the lime,\nand grow separately on long weedy stalks. The fruit ripens in six\nmonths. When it is matured, it is of either a red or a yellow tint,\nand is somewhat like a very rough gherkin. Only two varieties appear to\nbe cultivated in the Philippines. [78] The pulp of the fruit is white,\ntender, and of an agreeable acid taste, and contains from eighteen\nto twenty-four kernels, arranged in five rows. These kernels are as\nlarge as almonds, and, like them, consist of a couple of husks and a\nsmall core. This is the cacao bean; which, roasted and finely ground,\nproduces cacao, and with the addition of sugar, and generally of\nspice, makes chocolate. Till the last few years, every household\nin the Philippines made its own chocolate, of nothing but cacao\nand sugar. The natives who eat chocolate often add roasted rice to\nit. Nowadays there is a manufactory in Manila, which makes chocolate\nin the European way. The inhabitants of the eastern provinces are\nvery fond of adding roasted pili nuts to their chocolate. [79]",
        "[Chocolate.] Europeans first learnt to make a drink from cacao in\nMexico, where the preparation was called chocolatl. [80] Even so far\nback as the days of Cortes, who was a tremendous chocolate drinker,\nthe cacao-tree was extensively cultivated. The Aztecs used the beans\nas money; and Montezuma used to receive part of his tribute in this\npeculiar coin. It was only the wealthy among the ancient Mexicans\nwho ate pure cacao; the poor, on account of the value of the beans\nas coins, used to mix maize and mandioca meal with them. Even in our\nown day the inhabitants of Central America make use of the beans as\nsmall coins, as they have no copper money, nor smaller silver coins\nthan the half-real. Both in Central America and in Orinoco there yet\nare many unpenetrated forests which are almost entirely composed of\nwild cacao-trees. I believe the natives gather some of their fruit,\nbut it is almost worthless. By itself it has much less flavor than the\ncultivated kinds. Certainly it is not picked and dried at the proper\nseason, and it gets spoilt in its long transit through the damp woods.",
        "[An uncertain venture.] Since the abolition of slavery, the crops in\nAmerica have been diminishing year by year, and until a short time ago,\nwhen the French laid out several large plantations in Central America,\nwere of but trifling value. According to F. Engel, a flourishing\ncacao plantation required less outlay and trouble, and yields more\nprofit than any other tropical plant; yet its harvests, which do not\nyield anything for the first five or six years, are very uncertain,\nowing to the numerous insects which attack the plants. In short,\ncacao plantations are only suited to large capitalists, or to very\nsmall cultivators who grow the trees in their own gardens. Moreover,\nas we have said, since the abolition of slavery most of the plantations\nhave fallen into decay, for the freed slaves are entirely wanting\nin industry.",
        "[Use in Europe.] The original chocolate was not generally relished\nin Europe. When, however, at a later period, it was mixed with sugar,\nit met with more approbation. The exaggerated praise of its admirers\nraised a bitter opposition amongst the opponents of the new drink;\nand the priests raised conscientious scruples against the use of so\nnourishing an article of food on fast days. The quarrel lasted till\nthe seventeenth century, by which time cacao had become an everyday\nnecessity in Spain. It was first introduced into Spain in 1520; but\nchocolate, on account of the monopoly of the Conquistadores, was for a\nlong time secretly prepared on the other side of the ocean. In 1580,\nhowever, it was in common use in Spain, though it was so entirely\nunknown in England that, in 1579, an English captain burnt a captured\ncargo of it as useless. It reached Italy in 1606, and was introduced\ninto France by Anne of Austria. The first chocolate-house in London\nwas opened in 1657, and in 1700 Germany at last followed suit. [81]",
        "[Coffee.] The history of coffee in the Philippines is very similar\nto that of cacao. The plant thrives wonderfully, and its berry has\nso strongly marked a flavor that the worst Manila coffee commands as\nhigh a price as the best Java. In spite of this, however, the amount\nof coffee produced in the Philippines is very insignificant, and,\nuntil lately, scarcely deserved mention. According to the report of an\nEnglishman in 1828, the coffee-plant was almost unknown forty years\nbefore, and was represented only by a few specimens in the Botanical\nGardens at Manila. It soon, however, increased and multiplied, thanks\nto the moderation of a small predatory animal (paradoxurus musanga),\nwhich only nibbled the ripe fruit, and left the hard kernels (the\ncoffee beans) untouched, as indigestible. The Economical Society\nbestirred itself in its turn by offering rewards to encourage the\nlaying out of large coffee plantations. In 1837 it granted to M. de\nla Gironnière a premium of $1,000, for exhibiting a coffee plantation\nof sixty thousand plants, which were yielding their second harvest;\nand four premiums to others in the following year. But as soon as\nthe rewards were obtained the plantations were once more allowed to\nfall into neglect. From this it is pretty evident that the enterprise,\nin the face of the then market prices and the artificially high rates\nof freight, did not afford a sufficient profit.",
        "[Exports.] In 1856 the exports of coffee were not more than seven\nthousand piculs; in 1865 they had increased to thirty-seven thousand,\nfive hundred and eighty-eight; and in 1871, to fifty-three thousand,\nthree hundred and seventy. This increase, however, affords no criterion\nby which to estimate the increase in the number of plantations,\nfor these make no returns for the first few years after being laid\nout. In short, larger exports may be confidently expected. But even\ngreatly increased exports could not be taken as correct measures\nof the colony’s resources. Not till European capital calls large\nplantations into existence in the most suitable localities will the\nPhilippines obtain their proper rank in the coffee-producing districts\nof the world.",
        "[Highest grades.] The best coffee comes from the provinces of\nLaguna, Batangas and Cavite; the worst from Mindanao. The latter,\nin consequence of careless treatment, is very impure, and generally\ncontains a quantity of bad beans. The coffee beans of Mindanao are\nof a yellowish-white color and flabby; those of Laguna are smaller,\nbut much firmer in texture.",
        "[French preference.] Manila coffee is very highly esteemed by\nconnoisseurs, and is very expensive, though it is by no means so\nnice looking as that of Ceylon and other more carefully prepared\nkinds. It is a remarkable fact that in 1865 France, which imported\nonly $21,000 worth of hemp from the Philippines, imported more than\n$200,000 worth of Manila coffee, a third of the entire coffee produce\nof the Islands. [82] Manila coffee is not much prized in London,\nand does not fetch much more than good Ceylon ($15 per cwt.). [83]\nThis, however, is no reproach to the coffee, as every one acquainted\nwith an Englishman’s appreciation of coffee will allow.",
        "[Prices.] California, an excellent customer, always ready to give\na fair price for a good article, will in time become one of its\nprincipal consumers. [84] In 1868, coffee in Manila itself cost\nan average of $16 per picul. [85] In Java, the authorities pay the\nnatives, who are compelled to cultivate it, about $3.66 per picul.",
        "[Philippine exports.] Although the amount of coffee exported from the\nPhilippines is trifling in comparison with the producing powers of the\ncolony, it compares favorably with the exports from other countries.",
        "[Javan and Ceylon crops.] In my Sketches of Travel, I compared the\ndecrease of the coffee produced in Java under the forced system of\ncultivation with the increase of that voluntarily grown in Ceylon,\nand gave the Javanese produce for 1858 as sixty-seven thousand tons,\nand the Cingalese as thirty-five thousand tons. Since that time the\nrelative decrease and increase have continued; and in 1866 the Dutch\nIndies produced only fifty-six thousand tons, and Ceylon thirty-six\nthousand tons. [86]",
        "[Amateur scientists.] During my enforced stay in Daraga the natives\nbrought me mussels and snails for sale; and several of them wished\nto enter my service, as they felt “a particular vocation for Natural\nHistory.” At last my kitchen was always full of them. They sallied\nforth every day to collect insects, and as a rule were not particularly\nfortunate in their search; but this was of no consequence; in fact,\nit served to give them a fresh appetite for their meals. Some of the\nneighboring Spaniards paid me almost daily visits; and several of\nthe native and mestizo dignitaries from a distance were good enough\nto call upon me, not so much for the purpose of seeing my humble self\nas of inspecting my hat, the fame of which had spread over the whole\nprovince. It was constructed in the usual judicious mushroom shape,\ncovered with nito, [87] and its pinnacle was adorned with a powerful\noil lamp, furnished with a closely fitting lid, like that of a dark\nlantern, so that it could be carried in the pocket. This last was\nparticularly useful when riding about on a dark night.",
        "[Nito cigar cases.] In the neighboring pueblo cigar-cases were\nmade out of this nito. They are not of much use as an article of\ncommerce, and usually are only made to order. To obtain a dozen a\nwould-be purchaser must apply to as many individuals, who, at the\nshortest, will condescend to finish one in a few months. The stalk\nof the fern, which is about as thick as a lucifer match, is split\ninto four strips. The workman then takes a strip in his left hand,\nand, with his thumb on the back and his forefinger on the edge, draws\nthe strips up and down against the knife blade until the soft pithy\nparts are cut away, and what remains has become fine enough for the\nnext process. The cases are made on pointed cylindrical pieces of\nwood almost a couple of feet long. A pin is stuck into the center\nof the end of the cylinder, and the workman commences by fastening\nthe strips of fern stalk to it. The size of the case corresponds to\nthe  diameter of the roller, and a small wooden disk is placed in the\nbottom of the case to keep it steady while the sides are being plaited.",
        "[A Filipino theater.] When my ankle began to get better, my\nfirst excursion was to Legaspi, where some Filipinos were giving\na theatrical performance. A Spanish political refugee directed\nthe entertainment. On each side of the stage, roofed in with palm\nleaves, ran covered galleries for the dignitaries of the place; the\nuncovered space between these was set apart for the common people. The\nperformers had chosen a play taken from Persian history. The language\nwas Spanish, and the dresses were, to say the least, eccentric. The\nstage was erected hard by a public street, which itself formed part\nof the auditorium, and the noise was so great that I could only catch\na word here and there. The actors stalked on, chattering their parts,\nwhich not one of them understood, and moving their arms up and down;\nand when they reached the edge of the stage, they tacked and went back\nagain like ships sailing against the wind. Their countenances were\nentirely devoid of expression, and they spoke like automatons. If I\nhad understood the words, the contrast between their meaning and the\nmachine-like movements of the actors would probably have been droll\nenough; but, as it was, the noise, the heat, and the smoke were so\ngreat that we soon left the place.",
        "[An indifferent performance.] Both the theatrical performance and\nthe whole festival bore the impress of laziness, indifference, and\nmindless mimicry. When I compared the frank cheerfulness I had seen\nradiating from every countenance at the religious holidays of Europe\nwith the expressionless and immobile faces of the natives, I found it\ndifficult to understand how the latter were persuaded to waste so much\ntime and money upon a matter they seemed so thoroughly indifferent to.",
        "[Interest in festival.] Travellers have remarked the same want of\ngaiety amongst the Indians of America; and some of them ascribe it\nto the small development of the nervous system prevalent among these\npeoples, to which cause also they attribute their wonderful courage\nin bearing pain. But Tylor observes that the Indian’s countenance is\nso different from ours that it takes us several years to rightly\ninterpret its expression. There probably is something in both\nthese explanations. And, although I observed no lively expression of\namusement among my native friends at Legaspi, I noticed that they took\nthe greatest possible pleasure in decorating their village, and that\nthe procession which formed part of the festival had extraordinary\ncharms for them. Every individual was dressed in his very best; and\nthe honor of carrying a banner inspired those who attained it with the\ngreatest pride, and raised an amazing amount of envy in the breasts of\nthe remainder. Visitors poured in from all the surrounding hamlets, and\nerected triumphal arches which they had brought with them ready-made\nand which bore some complimentary inscription. I am obliged to confess\nthat some of the holiday-makers were very drunk. The inhabitants of the\nPhilippines have a great love for strong drink; even the young girls\noccasionally get intoxicated. When night came on, the strangers were\nhospitably lodged in the dwellings of the village. On such occasions\nnative hospitality shows itself in a very favorable light. The door\nof every house stands open, and even balls take place in some of the\nlarger hamlets. The Spanish and mestizo cavaliers, however, condescend\nto dance only with mestiza partners, and very seldom invite a pretty\nnative girl to join them. The natives very rarely dance together; but\nin Samar I was present on one occasion at a by no means ungraceful\nnative dance where “improvised” verses were sung. The male dancer\ncompared his partner with a rose, and she answered he should be\ncareful in touching it as a rose had thorns. This would have been\nthought a charming compliment in the mouth of an Andalusian.",
        "[Servant subterfuges.] The idle existence we spent in Daraga was so\nagreeable to my servants and their numerous friends that they were\nanxious I should stay there as long as possible; and they adopted some\nvery ingenious means to persuade me to do so. Twice, when everything\nwas prepared for a start the next morning, my shoes were stolen in the\nnight; and on another occasion they kidnapped my horse. When a native\nhas a particularly heavy load to carry, or a long journey to make,\nhe thinks nothing of coolly appropriating the well-fed beast of some\nSpaniard; which, when he has done with it, he turns loose without\nattempting to feed it, and it wanders about till somebody catches\nit and stalls it in the nearest “Tribunal.” There it is kept tied up\nand hungry until its master claims it and pays its expenses. I had a\ndollar to pay when I recovered mine, although it was nearly starved\nto death, on the pretence that it had swallowed rice to that value\nsince it had been caught.",
        "[Petty robberies.] Small robberies occur very frequently, but they\nare committed–as an acquaintance, a man who had spent some time\nin the country, informed me one evening when I was telling him my\ntroubles–only upon the property of new arrivals; old residents, he\nsaid, enjoyed a prescriptive freedom from such little inconveniences. I\nfancy some waggish native must have overheard our conversation, for\nearly the next morning my friend, the old resident, sent to borrow\nchocolate, biscuits, and eggs of me, as his larder and his hen-house\nhad been rifled during the night.",
        "[Daraga market.] Monday and Friday evenings were the Daraga market\nnights, and in fine weather always afforded a pretty sight. The\nwomen, neatly and cleanly clad, sat in long rows and offered their\nprovisions for sale by the light of hundreds of torches; and, when\nthe business was over, the slopes of the mountains were studded all\nover with flickering little points of brightness proceeding from the\ntorches carried by the homeward-bound market women. Besides eatables,\nmany had silks and stuffs woven from the fibers of the pine-apple\nand the banana for sale. These goods they carried on their heads;\nand I noticed that all the younger women were accompanied by their\nsweethearts, who relieved them of their burdens.",
