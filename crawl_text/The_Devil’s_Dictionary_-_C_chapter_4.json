        "CABBAGE, n.  A familiar kitchen-garden vegetable about as large and \nwise as a man’s head.\n  The cabbage is so called from Cabagius, a prince who on ascending \nthe throne issued a decree appointing a High Council of Empire \nconsisting of the members of his predecessor’s Ministry and the \ncabbages in the royal garden.

        "CALLOUS, adj.  Gifted with great fortitude to bear the evils \nafflicting another.\n  When Zeno was told that one of his enemies was no more he was \nobserved to be deeply moved.  “What!” said one of his disciples, “you \nweep at the death of an enemy?”  “Ah, ’tis true,” replied the great \nStoic; “but you should see me smile at the death of a friend.”",

        "CANONICALS, n.  The motley worm by Jesters of the Court of Heaven.",
        "CAPITAL, n.  The seat of misgovernment.

Capital Punishment, a penalty regarding the \njustice and expediency of which many worthy persons — including all \nthe assassins — entertain grave misgivings.",

O give,\n  Give that her holy sons may live!\"\n      And Death replied,\n      Smiling long and wide:\n      “I’ll give, holy father, I’ll give thee — a ride.”",
        "      With a rattle and bang\n      Of his bones, he sprang\n  From his famous Pale Horse, with his spear;\n      By the neck and the foot\n      Seized the fellow, and put\n  Him astride with his face to the rear.",
        "  The Monarch laughed loud with a sound that fell\n  Like clods on the coffin’s sounding shell:\n  “Ho, ho!  A beggar on horseback, they say,\n      Will ride to the devil!” — and thump\n      Fell the flat of his dart on the rump\n  Of the charger, which galloped away.",
        "  Faster and faster and faster it flew,\n  Till the rocks and the flocks and the trees that grew\n  By the road were dim and blended and blue\n      To the wild, wild eyes\n      Of the rider — in size\n      Resembling a couple of blackberry pies.\n  Death laughed again, as a tomb might laugh\n      At a burial service spoiled,\n      And the mourners’ intentions foiled\n      By the body erecting\n      Its head and objecting\n  To further proceedings in its behalf.",
        "  Many a year and many a day\n  Have passed since these events away.\n  The monk has long been a dusty corse,\n  And Death has never recovered his horse.\n      For the friar got hold of its tail,\n      And steered it within the pale\n  Of the monastery gray,\n  Where the beast was stabled and fed\n  With barley and oil and bread\n  Till fatter it grew than the fattest friar,\n  And so in due course was appointed Prior.",

        "CENTAUR, n.  One of a race of persons who lived before the division of \nlabor had been carried to such a pitch of differentiation, and who \nfollowed the primitive economic maxim, “Every man his own horse.”  The \nbest of the lot was Chiron, who to the wisdom and virtues of the horse \nadded the fleetness of man.  The scripture story of the head of John \nthe Baptist on a charger shows that pagan myths have somewhat \nsophisticated sacred history.",
        "CERBERUS, n.  The watch-dog of Hades, whose duty it was to guard the \nentrance — against whom or what does not clearly appear; everybody, \nsooner or later, had to go there, and nobody wanted to carry off the \nentrance.  Cerberus is known to have had three heads, and some of the \npoets have credited him with as many as a hundred.  Professor \nGraybill, whose clerky erudition and profound knowledge of Greek give \nhis opinion great weight, has averaged all the estimates, and makes \nthe number twenty-seven — a judgment that would be entirely \nconclusive is Professor Graybill had known (a) something about dogs, \nand (b) something about arithmetic.",
        "CHILDHOOD, n.  The period of human life intermediate between the \nidiocy of infancy and the folly of youth — two removes from the sin \nof manhood and three from the remorse of age.",
        "CHRISTIAN, n.  One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely \ninspired book admirably suited to the spiritual needs of his neighbor.  \nOne who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not \ninconsistent with a life of sin.",
        "  I dreamed I stood upon a hill, and, lo!\n  The godly multitudes walked to and fro\n  Beneath, in Sabbath garments fitly clad,\n  With pious mien, appropriately sad,\n  While all the church bells made a solemn din —\n  A fire-alarm to those who lived in sin.\n  Then saw I gazing thoughtfully below,\n  With tranquil face, upon that holy show\n  A tall, spare figure in a robe of white,\n  Whose eyes diffused a melancholy light.\n  “God keep you, strange,” I exclaimed.  “You are\n  No doubt (your habit shows it) from afar;\n  And yet I entertain the hope that you,\n  Like these good people, are a Christian too.\"\n  He raised his eyes and with a look so stern\n  It made me with a thousand blushes burn\n  Replied — his manner with disdain was spiced:\n  “What!  I a Christian?  No, indeed!  I’m Christ.”",

        "CLERGYMAN, n.  A man who undertakes the management of our spiritual \naffairs as a method of better his temporal ones.",
        "CLIO, n.  One of the nine Muses.  Clio’s function was to preside over \nhistory — which she did with great dignity, many of the prominent \ncitizens of Athens occupying seats on the platform, the meetings being \naddressed by Messrs. Xenophon, Herodotus and other popular speakers.",
        "CLOCK, n.  A machine of great moral value to man, allaying his concern \nfor the future by reminding him what a lot of time remains to him.",

        "\nCLOSE-FISTED, adj.  Unduly desirous of keeping that which many \nmeritorious persons wish to obtain.",
        "  “Close-fisted Scotchman!” Johnson cried\n      To thrifty J. Macpherson;\n  “See me — I’m ready to divide\n      With any worthy person.\"\n  Sad Jamie:  “That is very true —\n      The boast requires no backing;\n  And all are worthy, sir, to you,\n      Who have what you are lacking.”",

        "\nCROSS, n.  An ancient religious symbol erroneously supposed to owe its \nsignificance to the most solemn event in the history of Christianity, \nbut really antedating it by thousands of years.  By many it has been \nbelieved to be identical with the crux ansata of the ancient phallic \nworship, but it has been traced even beyond all that we know of that, \nto the rites of primitive peoples.  We have to-day the White Cross as \na symbol of chastity, and the Red Cross as a badge of benevolent \nneutrality in war.

        "CUI BONO?  [Latin]  What good would that do me?",
        "CUNNING, n.  The faculty that distinguishes a weak animal or person \nfrom a strong one.  It brings its possessor much mental satisfaction \nand great material adversity.  An Italian proverb says:  “The furrier \ngets the skins of more foxes than asses.”",
        "CUPID, n.  The so-called god of love.  This bastard creation of a \nbarbarous fancy was no doubt inflicted upon mythology for the sins of \nits deities.  Of all unbeautiful and inappropriate conceptions this is \nthe most reasonless and offensive.  The notion of symbolizing sexual \nlove by a semisexless babe, and comparing the pains of passion to the \nwounds of an arrow — of introducing this pudgy homunculus into art \ngrossly to materialize the subtle spirit and suggestion of the work — \nthis is eminently worthy of the age that, giving it birth, laid it on \nthe doorstep of prosperity.",
