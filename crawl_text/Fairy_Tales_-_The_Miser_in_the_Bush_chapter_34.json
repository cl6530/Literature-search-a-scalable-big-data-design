        "A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for\nhim three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came\ninto the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any\nlonger; so he went to his master, and said, ’I have worked hard for\nyou a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have\nfor my trouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was\nvery simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every\nyear’s service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of\nmoney to have, and said to himself, ’Why should I work hard, and live\nhere on bad fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and\nmake myself merry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set\nout, roaming over hill and valley.",
        "As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little\ndwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry. ’Why, what should\nmake me down-hearted?’ said he; ’I am sound in health and rich in\npurse, what should I care for? I have saved up my three years’\nearnings and have it all safe in my pocket.’ ’How much may it come\nto?’ said the little man. ’Full threepence,’ replied the countryman.\n’I wish you would give them to me,’ said the other; ’I am very poor.’\nThen the man pitied him, and gave him all he had; and the little dwarf\nsaid in return, ’As you have such a kind honest heart, I will grant\nyou three wishes–one for every penny; so choose whatever you like.’\nThen the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, ’I like many\nthings better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring\ndown everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone\ndancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that\neveryone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf said he should have his\nthree wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went his way.",
        "Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry\nbefore, he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he\nmet an old miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig\nsat a thrush singing away most joyfully. ’Oh, what a pretty bird!’\nsaid the miser; ’I would give a great deal of money to have such a\none.’ ’If that’s all,’ said the countryman, ’I will soon bring it\ndown.’ Then he took up his bow, and down fell the thrush into the\nbushes at the foot of the tree. The miser crept into the bush to find\nit; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his\nfiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about,\ncapering higher and higher in the air. The thorns soon began to tear\nhis clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself was\nall scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down. ’Oh, for\nheaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ’Master! master! pray let the fiddle\nalone. What have I done to deserve this?’ ’Thou hast shaved many a\npoor soul close enough,’ said the other; ’thou art only meeting thy\nreward’: so he played up another tune. Then the miser began to beg and\npromise, and offered money for his liberty; but he did not come up to\nthe musician’s price for some time, and he danced him along brisker\nand brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till at last he\noffered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse, and had\njust gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman saw so\nmuch money, he said, ’I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took the\npurse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his\nbargain.",
        "Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\nplight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve\nhis late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and\ncomplained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him\ninto the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his\nback and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his\nofficers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he\nwas soon caught and brought up to be tried.",
        "The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his\nmoney. ’No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the\ncountryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the\nmatter short by ordering him off to the gallows.",
        "So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ’My Lord\nJudge, grant me one last request.’ ’Anything but thy life,’ replied\nthe other. ’No,’ said he, ’I do not ask my life; only to let me play\nupon my fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ’Oh, no! no!\nfor heaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the\njudge said, ’It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact\nwas, he could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third\ngift.",
        "Then the miser said, ’Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’\nBut the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the\nfirst note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began\ncapering, and no one could hold the miser. At the second note the\nhangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had\nplayed the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together–judge,\ncourt, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on. At\nfirst the thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on\na while, and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing, they\nbegan to cry out, and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit\nthe more for their entreaties, till the judge not only gave him his\nlife, but promised to return him the hundred florins.",
        "Then he called to the miser, and said, ’Tell us now, you vagabond,\nwhere you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’\n’I stole it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ’I\nacknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the\ncountryman stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at\nthe gallows.",
