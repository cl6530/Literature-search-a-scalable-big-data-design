        "––Crowded in the rank and narrow ship,–\nHoused on the wild sea with wild usages,–\nWhate’er in the inland dales the land conceals\nOf fair and exquisite, O! nothing, nothing,\nDo we behold of that in our rude voyage.\n                 Coleridge’s Wallenstein.",
        "Two years before the mast were but an episode in the life of\nRichard Henry Dana, Jr.; yet the narrative in which he details the\nexperiences of that period is, perhaps, his chief claim to a wide\nremembrance.  His services in other than literary fields occupied\nthe greater part of his life, but they brought him comparatively\nsmall recognition and many disappointments.  His happiest\nassociations were literary, his pleasantest acquaintanceships\nthose which arose through his fame as the author of one book.\nThe story of his life is one of honest and competent effort,\nof sincere purpose, of many thwarted hopes.  The traditions\nof his family forced him into a profession for which he was\nintellectually but not temperamentally fitted: he should have\nbeen a scholar, teacher, and author; instead he became a lawyer.",
        "Born in Cambridge, Mass., August 1, 1815, Richard Henry Dana, Jr.,\ncame of a line of Colonial ancestors whose legal understanding and\npatriotic zeal had won them distinction.  His father, if possessed\nof less vigor than his predecessors, was yet a man of culture and\nability.  He was widely known as poet, critic, and lecturer; and\nendowed his son with native qualities of intelligence, good breeding,\nand honesty.",
        "After somewhat varied and troublous school days, young Dana entered\nHarvard University, where he took high rank in his classes and bid\nfair to make a reputation as a scholar.  But at the beginning of his\nthird year of college a severe attack of measles interrupted his\ncourse, and so affected his eyes as to preclude, for a time at least,\nall idea of study.  The state of the family finances was not such as to\npermit of foreign travel in search of health.  Accordingly, prompted by\nnecessity and by a youthful love of adventure, he shipped as a common\nsailor in the brig, Pilgrim, bound for the California coast.  His\nterm of service lasted a trifle over two years–from August, 1834,\nto September, 1836.  The undertaking was one calculated to kill or cure.\nFortunately it had the latter effect; and, upon returning to his native\nplace, physically vigorous but intellectually starved, he reentered\nHarvard and worked with such enthusiasm as to graduate in six months\nwith honor.",
        "Then came the question of his life work.  Though intensely religious,\nhe did not feel called to the ministry; business made no appeal;\nhis ancestors had been lawyers; it seemed best that he should follow\nwhere they had led.  Had conditions been those of to-day, he would\nnaturally have drifted into some field of scholarly research,\n–political science or history.  As it was, he entered law school,\nwhich, in 1840, he left to take up the practice of his profession.\nBut Dana had not the tact, the personal magnetism, or the business\nsagacity to make a brilliant success before the bar.  Despite the\nfact that he had become a master of legal theory, an authority upon\ninternational questions, and a counsellor of unimpeachable integrity,\nhis progress was painfully slow and toilsome.  Involved with his lack\nof tact and magnetism there was, too, an admirable quality of sturdy\nobstinacy that often worked him injury.  Though far from sharing the\nradical ideas of the Abolitionists, he was ardent in his anti-slavery\nideas and did not hesitate to espouse the unpopular doctrines of the\nFree-Soil party of 1848, or to labor for the freedom of those Boston\nnegroes, who, under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, were in danger\nof deportation to the South.",
        "His activity in the latter direction resulted in pecuniary loss,\nsocial ostracism and worse; for upon one occasion he was set upon\nand nearly killed by a pair of thugs.  But Dana was not a man to be\nswerved from his purpose by considerations of policy or of personal\nsafety.  He met his problems as they came to him, took the course\nwhich he believed to be right and then stuck to it with indomitable\ntenacity.  Yet, curiously enough, with none of the characteristics\nof the politician, he longed for political preferment.  At the hands\nof the people this came to him in smallest measure only.  Though at\none time a member of the Massachusetts Legislature, he was defeated\nas candidate for the lower house of Congress, and in 1876 suffered\nthe bitterest disappointment of his life, when the libellous attacks\nof enemies prevented the ratification of his nomination as Minister\nto England.",
        "Previous to this he had served his country as United States\nDistrict Attorney during the Civil War, a time when the office\ndemanded the highest type of ability and uprightness.  That the\ngovernment appreciated this was shown in 1867 by its choice of\nDana as one of its counsel in the prosecution of Jefferson Davis\nfor treason.  The position of legal representative before the\nHalifax tribunal of 1877, which met to discuss fishery questions\nat issue between the United States and Canada, was given him no\ndoubt in part because of his eminent fitness, in part as balm for\nthe wound of the preceding year.",
        "But whatever satisfaction he may have found in such honors as time\nand ripening years brought to him, his chief joy and relaxation lay\nin travel. When worry and overwork began to tell upon him, he would\nbetake himself to shore or mountains.  Upon several occasions he\nvisited Europe, and in 1859 made a tour of the world.  At length,\nin 1876, he gave up active life and took residence abroad, with\nthe idea of finding leisure for the preparation of a treatise on\ninternational law.  He was still engaged in collecting his material\nwhen, on January 6, 1882, death overtook him.  He was buried in Rome\nin the Protestant Cemetery, whose cypresses cast their long shadows\nover the graves of many distinguished foreigners who have sought a\nlast refuge of health and peace under the skies of Italy.",
        "Such a career as his would seem far enough from being a failure.\nYet, in retirement, Dana looked back upon it not without regret.\nAs a lawyer, he had felt a justifiable desire to see his labors\ncrowned by his elevation to the bench; as an active participant in\npublic affairs, he had felt that his services and talents rendered\nhim deserving of a seat in Congress.  Lacking these things, he might\nhave hoped that the practice of his profession would yield him a\nfortune.  Here again he was disappointed.  In seeking the fulfillment\nof his ambitions, he was always on the high road to success; he never\nquite arrived.",
        "It is remarkable that, having written one successful book, Dana did not\nseek further reward as a man of letters.  Two Years before the Mast\nappeared in 1840, while its author was still a law student.  Though\nat the time it created no great stir in the United States, it was most\nfavorably received in England, where it paved the way for many pleasant\nand valuable acquaintanceships.  The following year, Dana produced\na small volume on seamanship, entitled The Seaman’s Friend.  This,\nand a short account of a trip to Cuba in 1859, constitute the sole\nadditions to his early venture.  He was a copious letter-writer and\nkept full journals of his various travels; but he never elaborated\nthem for publication.  Yet, long before his death, he had seen the\nnarrative of his sailor days recognized as an American classic.\nTime has not diminished its reputation.  We read it to-day not\nmerely for its simple, unpretentious style; but for its clear\npicture of sea life previous to the era of steam navigation, and\nfor its graphic description of conditions in California before\nvisions of gold sent the long lines of “prairie schooners” drifting\nacross the plains to unfold the hidden destiny of the West.",
        "It is not easy to realize that, during the stirring days when the\neastern coast-line of North America was experiencing the ferment\nof revolution, the Pacific seaboard was almost totally unexplored,\nits population largely a savage one.  But Spain, long established\nin Mexico, was slowly pushing northward along the California coast.\nHer emissaries were the Franciscan friars; her method the founding\nof Indian missions round which, in due course, should arise towns\nintended to afford harbor for Spanish ships and to serve as outposts\nagainst the steady encroachments of Russia, who, from Alaska, was\nreaching out toward San Francisco Bay.",
        "Thus began the white settlement of California.  San Diego Mission\nwas founded in 1769; San Carlos, at Monterey, in 1770; San Francisco,\nin 1776; Santa Barbara, in 1786.  For the general guardianship of\nthese missions a garrison, or presidio, was in each case provided.\nIt was responsible not only for the protection of the town thus\ncreated, but for all the missions in the district.  The presidio of\nSan Diego, for example, was in charge of the missions of San Diego,\nSan Gabriel, San Juan Capistrano, and San Luis Rey.  So, likewise,\nthere were garrisons with extensive jurisdiction at Santa Barbara,\nMonterey, and San Francisco.",
        "The Indians in the immediate vicinity of a mission were attached\nthereto by a sort of gentle enslavement.  They were provided special\nquarters, were carefully looked after by the priests, their religious\neducation fostered, and their innate laziness conquered by specific\nrequirements of labor in agriculture, cattle raising, and simple\nhandicrafts.  It was an arrangement which worked well for both parties\nconcerned.  The slavery of the Indians was not unlike the obligation\nof children to their parents; they were comfortable, well behaved,\nand for the most part contented with the rule of the friars, who,\non their side, began to accumulate considerable wealth from the\nwell-directed efforts of their charges.",
        "The supposition was that in the course of years the Indians might\nbecome so habituated to thrift and industry as to be released from\nsupervision and safely left to their own devices.  But that happy\nconsummation had not occurred when, in 1826, Mexico succeeded in\nseparating herself from the mother country and began her career as an\nindependent republic, of which California was a part.  Nevertheless,\nthe greed of politicians suddenly wrought the change which was to\nhave come as the slow development of years.  By governmental decree,\nthe Indians were declared free of obligation to the friars; the latter\nwere stripped of their temporal powers, their funds seized under the\nguise of a loan, and their establishments often subjected to what was\nlittle short of pillage.  This state of affairs had scarcely begun at\nthe time of the author’s visit to California; still, as he points out\nin Chapter XXI, the decline of the missions had already set in.",
        "The final blow to their power and usefulness came, however, with\nthe upheaval accompanying the Mexican war and the acquisition of\nCalifornia by the United States.  Although this country returned\nall mission buildings to the control of the Church, their reason\nfor being had vanished; they were sold, or destroyed, or feebly\nmaintained on funds insufficient to forestall dilapidation.\nFortunately the Franciscan friars had built for beauty as well as for\nuse; the architecture which they devised in skillful adaptation of\ntheir native Spanish type displayed originality and picturesque charm.\nHence, of late years, Californians have come to feel a worthy pride\nin the monuments of the early history of their state, and have taken\nsteps to preserve such of them as survive.  No less than twenty-one\nare today the goal of the traveller.",
        "The reader who is interested in pursuing the subject thus outlined\nwill find its satisfactory treatment in George Wharton James’s\nIn and out of the old Missions of California, a book that combines\nagreeable reading with excellent illustrations.",

        "The following diagram, from which many details have been omitted,\npresents sufficient data for an understanding of the more important\nnautical terms which occur in the text.  A number of other such terms\nhave been explained in the notes.  In omitting reference to many more,\nthe editor has felt that ovarannotation would turn a straightforward\nand interesting narrative into a mere excuse for a nautical dictionary,\nand quite defeat the purpose of the book.  The author’s technical\nvocabulary, even when most bewildering, serves to give force and the\nvividness of local color to his descriptions.  To pause in the midst\nof a storm at sea for comment and definition would result merely in\nchecking the movement of the story and putting a damper upon the\nimagination.",
        "Two Years before the Mast affords the teacher a somewhat unusual\nopportunity.  Few literary works are better calculated to stimulate\ninquiry into the remarkable changes which three-quarters of a century\nhave wrought in the United States.  Much profitable class employment\nin the drawing of maps and the writing of brief themes dealing with\nvarious phases of the romantic history of California will suggest\nitself.  The numerous geographical allusions should be traced with\nthe aid of an atlas.",

        "PREFACE",
        "I am unwilling to present this narrative to the public without a\nfew words in explanation of my reasons for publishing it.  Since\nMr. Cooper’s Pilot and Red Rover, there have been so many stories\nof sea-life written, that I should really think it unjustifiable\nin me to add one to the number without being able to give reasons\nin some measure warranting me in so doing.",
        "With the single exception, as I am quite confident, of Mr. Ames’s\nentertaining, but hasty and desultory work, called “Mariner’s Sketches,\"\nall the books professing to give life at sea have been written by persons\nwho have gained their experience as naval officers, or passengers,\nand of these, there are very few which are intended to be taken as\nnarratives of facts.",
        "Now, in the first place, the whole course of life, and daily duties,\nthe discipline, habits and customs of a man-of-war are very different\nfrom those of the merchant service; and in the next place, however\nentertaining and well written these books may be, and however accurately\nthey may give sea-life as it appears to their authors, it must still be\nplain to every one that a naval officer, who goes to sea as a gentleman,\n\"with his gloves on,” (as the phrase is,) and who associated only with\nhis fellow-officers, and hardly speaks to a sailor except through a\nboatswain’s mate, must take a very different view of the whole matter\nfrom that which would be taken by a common sailor.",
        "Besides the interest which every one must feel in exhibitions of\nlife in those forms in which he himself has never experienced it;\nthere has been, of late years, a great deal of attention directed\ntoward common seamen, and a strong sympathy awakened in their behalf.\nYet I believe that, with the single exception which I have mentioned,\nthere has not been a book written, professing to give their life and\nexperiences, by one who has been of them, and can know what their\nlife really is.  A voice from the forecastle has hardly yet been\nheard.",
        "In the following pages I design to give an accurate and authentic\nnarrative of a little more than two years spent as a common sailor,\nbefore the mast, in the American merchant service.  It is written\nout from a journal which I kept at the time, and from notes which\nI made of most of the events as they happened; and in it I have\nadhered closely to fact in every particular, and endeavored to give\neach thing its true character.  In so doing, I have been obliged\noccasionally to use strong and coarse expressions, and in some\ninstances to give scenes which may be painful to nice feelings;\nbut I have very carefully avoided doing so, whenever I have not\nfelt them essential to giving the true character of a scene.\nMy design is, and it is this which has induced me to publish the\nbook, to present the life of a common sailor at sea as it really\nis,–the light and the dark together.",
        "There may be in some parts a good deal that is unintelligible to\nthe general reader; but I have found from my own experience, and\nfrom what I have heard from others, that plain matters of fact in\nrelation to customs and habits of life new to us, and descriptions\nof life under new aspects, act upon the inexperienced through the\nimagination, so that we are hardly aware of our want of technical\nknowledge.  Thousands read the escape of the American frigate\nthrough the British channel, and the chase and wreck of the Bristol\ntrader in the Red Rover, and follow the minute nautical manoeuvres\nwith breathless interest, who do not know the name of a rope in the\nship; and perhaps with none the less admiration and enthusiasm for\ntheir want of acquaintance with the professional detail.",
        "In preparing this narrative I have carefully avoided incorporating\ninto it any impressions but those made upon me by the events as\nthey occurred, leaving to my concluding chapter, to which I shall\nrespectfully call the reader’s attention, those views which have\nbeen suggested to me by subsequent reflection.",
        "These reasons, and the advice of a few friends, have led me to give this\nnarrative to the press.  If it shall interest the general reader, and\ncall more attention to the welfare of seamen, or give any information\nas to their real condition, which may serve to raise them in the rank\nof beings, and to promote in any measure their religious and moral\nimprovement, and diminish the hardships of their daily life, the end\nof its publication will be answered.",
        "                                R.H.D., Jr.\n                                Boston, July, 1840.",
        "The fourteenth of August was the day fixed upon for the sailing of\nthe brig Pilgrim on her voyage from Boston round Cape Horn to the\nwestern coast of North America.  As she was to get under weigh early\nin the afternoon, I made my appearance on board at twelve o’clock,\nin full sea-rig, and with my chest, containing an outfit for a two\nor three year voyage, which I had undertaken from a determination\nto cure, if possible, by an entire change of life, and by a long\nabsence from books and study, a weakness of the eyes, which had\nobliged me to give up my pursuits, and which no medical aid seemed\nlikely to cure.",
        "The change from the tight dress coat, silk cap, and kid gloves of an\nundergraduate at Cambridge, to the loose duck trowsers, checked shirt\nand tarpaulin hat of a sailor, though somewhat of a transformation,\nwas soon made, and I supposed that I should pass very well for a\njack tar.  But it is impossible to deceive the practised eye in\nthese matters; and while I supposed myself to be looking as salt\nas Neptune himself, I was, no doubt, known for a landsman by every\none on board as soon as I hove in sight.  A sailor has a peculiar\ncut to his clothes, and a way of wearing them which a green hand\ncan never get.  The trowsers, tight round the hips, and thence\nhanging long and loose round the feet, a superabundance of checked\nshirt, a low-crowned, well varnished black hat, worn on the back of\nthe head, with half a fathom of black ribbon hanging over the left\neye, and a peculiar tie to the black silk neckerchief, with sundry\nother minutiae, are signs, the want of which betray the beginner at\nonce.  Beside the points in my dress which were out of the way,\ndoubtless my complexion and hands were enough to distinguish me\nfrom the regular salt, who, with a sun-burnt cheek, wide step, and\nrolling gait, swings his bronzed and toughened hands athwart-ships,\nhalf open, as though just ready to grasp a rope.",
        "“With all my imperfections on my head,” I joined the crew, and we\nhauled out into the stream, and came to anchor for the night.\nThe next day we were employed in preparations for sea, reeving\nstudding-sail gear, crossing royal yards, putting on chafing gear,\nand taking on board our powder.  On the following night, I stood\nmy first watch.  I remained awake nearly all the first part of\nthe night from fear that I might not hear when I was called; and\nwhen I went on deck, so great were my ideas of the importance of\nmy trust, that I walked regularly fore and aft the whole length\nof the vessel, looking out over the bows and taffrail at each turn,\nand was not a little surprised at the coolness of the old salt whom\nI called to take my place, in stowing himself snugly away under the\nlong boat, for a nap.  That was sufficient lookout, he thought, for\na fine night, at anchor in a safe harbor.",
        "The next morning was Saturday, and a breeze having sprung up from\nthe southward, we took a pilot on board, hove up our anchor, and\nbegan beating down the bay.  I took leave of those of my friends\nwho came to see me off, and had barely opportunity to take a last\nlook at the city, and well-known objects, as no time is allowed on\nboard ship for sentiment.  As we drew down into the lower harbor,\nwe found the wind ahead in the bay, and were obliged to come to\nanchor in the roads.  We remained there through the day and a part\nof the night.  My watch began at eleven o’clock at night, and I\nreceived orders to call the captain if the wind came out from the\nwestward.  About midnight the wind became fair, and having called\nthe captain, I was ordered to call all hands.  How I accomplished\nthis I do not know, but I am quite sure I did not give the true\nhoarse, boatswain call of “A-a-ll ha-a-a-nds! up anchor, a-ho-oy!\"\nIn a short time every one was in motion, the sails loosed, the yards\nbraced, and we began to heave up the anchor, which was our last hold\nupon Yankee land.  I could take but little part in all these preparations.\nMy little knowledge of a vessel was all at fault.  Unintelligible orders\nwere so rapidly given and so immediately executed; there was such a\nhurrying about, and such an intermingling of strange cries and stranger\nactions, that I was completely bewildered.  There is not so helpless\nand pitiable an object in the world as a landsman beginning a sailor’s\nlife.  At length those peculiar, long-drawn sounds, which denote that\nthe crew are heaving the windlass, began, and in a few moments we were\nunder weigh.  The noise of the water thrown from the bows began to be\nheard, the vessel leaned over from the damp night breeze, and rolled\nwith the heavy ground swell, and we had actually begun our long, long\njourney.  This was literally bidding “good night” to my native land.",
        "The first day we passed at sea was the Sabbath.  As we were just from\nport, and there was a great deal to be done on board, we were kept at\nwork all day, and at night the watches were set, and everything put\ninto sea order.  When we were called aft to be divided into watches,\nI had a good specimen of the manner of a sea captain.  After the\ndivision had been made, he gave a short characteristic speech,\nwalking the quarter deck with a cigar in his mouth, and dropping\nthe words out between the puffs.",
        "“Now, my men, we have begun a long voyage.  If we get along well\ntogether, we shall have a comfortable time; if we don’t, we shall\nhave hell afloat.–All you’ve got to do is to obey your orders and\ndo your duty like men,–then you’ll fare well enough;–if you don’t,\nyou’ll fare hard enough,–I can tell you.  If we pull together, you’ll\nfind me a clever fellow; if we don’t, you’ll find me a bloody rascal.\n–That’s all I’ve got to say.–Go below, the larboard watch!”",
        "I being in the starboard or second mate’s watch, had the opportunity\nof keeping the first watch at sea.  S––-, a young man, making, like\nmyself, his first voyage, was in the same watch, and as he was the\nson of a professional man, and had been in a counting-room in Boston,\nwe found that we had many friends and topics in common.  We talked\nthese matters over,–Boston, what our friends were probably doing,\nour voyage, etc., until he went to take his turn at the look-out,\nand left me to myself.  I had now a fine time for reflection.  I felt\nfor the first time the perfect silence of the sea.  The officer was\nwalking the quarter deck, where I had no right to go, one or two men\nwere talking on the forecastle, whom I had little inclination to join,\nso that I was left open to the full impression of everything about me.\nHowever much I was affected by the beauty of the sea, the bright stars,\nand the clouds driven swiftly over them, I could not but remember that\nI was separating myself from all the social and intellectual enjoyments\nof life.  Yet, strange as it may seem, I did then and afterwards take\npleasure in these reflections, hoping by them to prevent my becoming\ninsensible to the value of what I was leaving.",
        "But all my dreams were soon put to flight by an order from the\nofficer to trim the yards, as the wind was getting ahead; and I\ncould plainly see by the looks the sailors occasionally cast to\nwindward, and by the dark clouds that were fast coming up, that we\nhad bad weather to prepare for, and had heard the captain say that\nhe expected to be in the Gulf Stream by twelve o’clock.  In a few\nminutes eight bells were struck, the watch called, and we went below.\nI now began to feel the first discomforts of a sailor’s life.\nThe steerage in which I lived was filled with coils of rigging,\nspare sails, old junk and ship stores, which had not been stowed\naway.  Moreover, there had been no berths built for us to sleep in,\nand we were not allowed to drive nails to hang our clothes upon.\nThe sea, too, had risen, the vessel was rolling heavily, and\neverything was pitched about in grand confusion.  There was a\ncomplete “hurrah’s nest,” as the sailors say, “everything on top\nand nothing at hand.”  A large hawser had been coiled away upon\nmy chest; my hats, boots, mattress and blankets had all fetched\naway and gone over to leeward, and were jammed and broken under\nthe boxes and coils of rigging.  To crown all, we were allowed\nno light to find anything with, and I was just beginning to feel\nstrong symptoms of sea-sickness, and that listlessness and\ninactivity which accompany it.  Giving up all attempts to collect\nmy things together, I lay down upon the sails, expecting every moment\nto hear the cry of “all hands, ahoy,” which the approaching storm would\nsoon make necessary.  I shortly heard the rain-drops falling on deck,\nthick and fast, and the watch evidently had their hands full of work,\nfor I could hear the loud and repeated orders of the mate, the trampling\nof feet, the creaking of blocks, and all the accompaniments of a coming\nstorm.  In a few minutes the slide of the hatch was thrown back, which\nlet down the noise and tumult of the deck still louder, the loud cry of\n\"All hands, ahoy! tumble up here and take in sail,” saluted our ears,\nand the hatch was quickly shut again.  When I got upon deck, a new\nscene and a new experience were before me.  The little brig was close\nhauled upon the wind, and lying over, as it then seemed to me, nearly\nupon her beam ends.  The heavy head sea was beating against her bows\nwith the noise and force almost of a sledge-hammer, and flying over the\ndeck, drenching us completely through.  The topsail halyards had been\nlet go, and the great sails filling out and backing against the masts\nwith a noise like thunder.  The wind was whistling through the rigging,\nloose ropes flying about; loud and, to me, unintelligible orders constantly\ngiven and rapidly executed, and the sailors “singing out” at the ropes in\ntheir hoarse and peculiar strains.  In addition to all this, I had not got\nmy “sea legs on,” was dreadfully sick, with hardly strength enough to hold\non to anything, and it was “pitch dark.”  This was my state when I was\nordered aloft, for the first time, to reef topsails.",
        "How I got along, I cannot now remember.  I “laid out” on the yards and\nheld on with all my strength.  I could not have been of much service,\nfor I remember having been sick several times before I left the topsail\nyard.  Soon all was snug aloft, and we were again allowed to go below.\nThis I did not consider much of a favor, for the confusion of everything\nbelow, and that inexpressible sickening smell, caused by the shaking up\nof the bilge-water in the hold, made the steerage but an indifferent\nrefuge from the cold, wet decks.  I had often read of the nautical\nexperiences of others, but I felt as though there could be none worse\nthan mine; for in addition to every other evil, I could not but remember\nthat this was only the first night of a two years’ voyage.  When we were\non deck we were not much better off, for we were continually ordered\nabout by the officer, who said that it was good for us to be in motion.\nYet anything was better than the horrible state of things below.\nI remember very well going to the hatchway and putting my head down,\nwhen I was oppressed by nausea, and always being relieved immediately.\nIt was as good as an emetic.",
        "This state of things continued for two days.",
        "Wednesday, Aug. 20th.  We had the watch on deck from four till eight,\nthis morning.  When we came on deck at four o’clock, we found things\nmuch changed for the better.  The sea and wind had gone down, and the\nstars were out bright.  I experienced a corresponding change in my\nfeelings; yet continued extremely weak from my sickness.  I stood in\nthe waist on the weather side, watching the gradual breaking of the\nday, and the first streaks of the early light.  Much has been said of\nthe sun-rise at sea; but it will not compare with the sun-rise on shore.\nIt wants the accompaniments of the songs of birds, the awakening hum\nof men, and the glancing of the first beams upon trees, hills, spires,\nand house-tops, to give it life and spirit.  But though the actual\nrise of the sun at sea is not so beautiful, yet nothing will compare\nwith the early breaking of day upon the wide ocean.",
        "There is something in the first grey streaks stretching along the\neastern horizon and throwing an indistinct light upon the face of\nthe deep, which combines with the boundlessness and unknown depth\nof the sea around you, and gives one a feeling of loneliness,\nof dread, and of melancholy foreboding, which nothing else in\nnature can give.  This gradually passes away as the light grows\nbrighter, and when the sun comes up, the ordinary monotonous sea\nday begins.",
        "From such reflections as these, I was aroused by the order from\nthe officer, “Forward there! rig the head-pump!”  I found that no\ntime was allowed for day-dreaming, but that we must “turn-to” at the\nfirst light.  Having called up the “idlers,” namely carpenter, cook,\nsteward, etc., and rigged the pump, we commenced washing down the decks.\nThis operation, which is performed every morning at sea, takes nearly\ntwo hours; and I had hardly strength enough to get through it.  After\nwe had finished, swabbed down, and coiled up the rigging, I sat down\non the spars, waiting for seven bells, which was the sign for breakfast.\nThe officer, seeing my lazy posture, ordered me to slush the main-mast,\nfrom the royal-mast-head, down.  The vessel was then rolling a little,\nand I had taken no sustenance for three days, so that I felt tempted to\ntell him that I had rather wait till after breakfast; but I knew that\nI must “take the bull by the horns,” and that if I showed any sign of\nwant of spirit or of backwardness, that I should be ruined at once.\nSo I took my bucket of grease and climbed up to the royal-mast-head.\nHere the rocking of the vessel, which increases the higher you go\nfrom the foot of the mast, which is the fulcrum of the lever, and the\nsmell of the grease, which offended my fastidious senses, upset my\nstomach again, and I was not a little rejoiced when I got upon the\ncomparative terra firma of the deck.  In a few minutes seven bells\nwere struck, the log hove, the watch called, and we went to breakfast.\nHere I cannot but remember the advice of the cook, a simple-hearted\nAfrican.  “Now,” says he, “my lad, you are well cleaned out; you\nhaven’t got a drop of your ’long-shore swash aboard of you.  You\nmust begin on a new tack,–pitch all your sweetmeats overboard,\nand turn-to upon good hearty salt beef and sea bread, and I’ll\npromise you, you’ll have your ribs well sheathed, and be as hearty\nas any of ’em, afore you are up to the Horn.”  This would be good\nadvice to give to passengers, when they speak of the little niceties\nwhich they have laid in, in case of sea-sickness.",
        "I cannot describe the change which half a pound of cold salt beef\nand a biscuit or two produced in me.  I was a new being.  We had\na watch below until noon, so that I had some time to myself;\nand getting a huge piece of strong, cold, salt beef from the cook,\nI kept gnawing upon it until twelve o’clock.  When we went on deck\nI felt somewhat like a man, and could begin to learn my sea duty\nwith considerable spirit.  At about two o’clock we heard the loud\ncry of “sail ho!” from aloft, and soon saw two sails to windward,\ngoing directly athwart our hawse.  This was the first time that\nI had seen a sail at sea.  I thought then, and always have since,\nthat it exceeds every other sight in interest and beauty.  They\npassed to leeward of us, and out of hailing distance; but the\ncaptain could read the names on their sterns with the glass.\nThey were the ship Helen Mar, of New York, and the brig Mermaid,\nof Boston.  They were both steering westward, and were bound in for\nour “dear native land.”",
        "Thursday, Aug. 21st.  This day the sun rose clear, we had a fine\nwind, and everything was bright and cheerful.  I had now got my\nsea legs on, and was beginning to enter upon the regular duties\nof a sea-life.  About six bells, that is, three o’clock, P.M., we\nsaw a sail on our larboard bow.  I was very anxious, like every new\nsailor, to speak her.  She came down to us, backed her main-top-sail,\nand the two vessels stood “head on,” bowing and curvetting at each\nother like a couple of war-horses reined in by their riders.  It was\nthe first vessel that I had seen near, and I was surprised to find\nhow much she rolled and pitched in so quiet a sea.  She lunged her\nhead into the sea, and then, her stern settling gradually down, her\nhuge bows rose up, showing the bright copper, and her stern, and\nbresthooks dripping, like old Neptune’s locks, with the brine.\nHer decks were filled with passengers who had come up at the cry\nof “sail ho,” and who by their dress and features appeared to be\nSwiss and French emigrants.  She hailed us at first in French,\nbut receiving no answer, she tried us in English.  She was the\nship La Carolina, from Havre, for New York.  We desired her to\nreport the brig Pilgrim, from Boston, for the north-west coast\nof America, five days out.  She then filled away and left us to\nplough on through our waste of waters.  This day ended pleasantly;\nwe had got into regular and comfortable weather, and into that\nroutine of sea-life which is only broken by a storm, a sail,\nor the sight of land.",
        "As we had now a long “spell” of fine weather, without any incident\nto break the monotony of our lives, there can be no better place to\ndescribe the duties, regulations, and customs of an American merchantman,\nof which ours was a fair specimen.",
        "The captain, in the first place, is lord paramount.  He stands no watch,\ncomes and goes when he pleases, and is accountable to no one, and must\nbe obeyed in everything, without a question, even from his chief officer.\nHe has the power to turn his officers off duty, and even to break them\nand make them do duty as sailors in the forecastle.  When there are no\npassengers and no supercargo, as in our vessel, he has no companion\nbut his own dignity, and no pleasures, unless he differs from most\nof his kind, but the consciousness of possessing supreme power, and,\noccasionally, the exercise of it.",
        "The prime minister, the official organ, and the active and superintending\nofficer, is the chief mate.  He is first lieutenant, boatswain,\nsailing-master, and quarter-master.  The captain tells him what\nhe wishes to have done, and leaves to him the care of overseeing,\nof allotting the work, and also the responsibility of its being\nwell done.  The mate (as he is always called, par excellence)\nalso keeps the log-book, for which he is responsible to the owners\nand insurers, and has the charge of the stowage, safe keeping, and\ndelivery of the cargo.  He is also, ex-officio, the wit of the crew;\nfor the captain does not condescend to joke with the men, and the\nsecond mate no one cares for; so that when “the mate” thinks fit to\nentertain “the people” with a coarse joke or a little practical wit,\nevery one feels bound to laugh.",
        "The second mate’s is proverbially a dog’s berth.  He is neither\nofficer nor man.  The men do not respect him as an officer, and he\nis obliged to go aloft to reef and furl the topsails, and to put\nhis hands into the tar and slush, with the rest.  The crew call\nhim the “sailor’s waiter,” as he has to furnish them with spun-yarn,\nmarline, and all other stuffs that they need in their work, and has\ncharge of the boatswain’s locker, which includes serving-boards,\nmarline-spikes, etc.  He is expected by the captain to maintain\nhis dignity and to enforce obedience, and still is kept at a great\ndistance from the mate, and obliged to work with the crew.  He is\none to whom little is given and of whom much is required.  His wages\nare usually double those of a common sailor, and he eats and sleeps\nin the cabin; but he is obliged to be on deck nearly all the time,\nand eats at the second table, that is, makes a meal out of what the\ncaptain and chief mate leave.",
        "The steward is the captain’s servant, and has charge of the pantry,\nfrom which every one, even the mate himself, is excluded.  These\ndistinctions usually find him an enemy in the mate, who does not\nlike to have any one on board who is not entirely under his control;\nthe crew do not consider him as one of their number, so he is left\nto the mercy of the captain.",
        "The cook is the patron of the crew, and those who are in his favor\ncan get their wet mittens and stockings dried, or light their pipes\nat the galley on the night watch.  These two worthies, together\nwith the carpenter and sailmaker, if there be one, stand no watch,\nbut, being employed all day, are allowed to “sleep in” at night,\nunless all hands are called.",
        "The crew are divided into two divisions, as equally as may be, called\nthe watches.  Of these the chief mate commands the larboard, and the\nsecond mate the starboard.  They divide the time between them, being\non and off duty, or, as it is called, on deck and below, every other\nfour hours.  If, for instance, the chief mate with the larboard watch\nhave the first night-watch from eight to twelve; at the end of the\nfour hours, the starboard watch is called, and the second mate takes\nthe deck, while the larboard watch and the first mate go below until\nfour in the morning, when they come on deck again and remain until\neight; having what is called the morning watch.  As they will have\nbeen on deck eight hours out of the twelve, while those who had the\nmiddle watch–from twelve to four, will only have been up four hours,\nthey have what is called a “forenoon watch below,” that is, from\neight, A.M., till twelve, M.  In a man-of-war, and in some merchantmen,\nthis alteration of watches is kept up throughout the twenty-four hours;\nbut our ship, like most merchantmen, had “all hands” from twelve o’clock\ntill dark, except in bad weather, when we had “watch and watch.”",
        "An explanation of the “dog watches” may, perhaps, be of use to one\nwho has never been at sea.  They are to shift the watches each\nnight, so that the same watch need not be on deck at the same hours.\nIn order to effect this, the watch from four to eight, P.M.,\nis divided into two half, or dog watches, one from four to six,\nand the other from six to eight.  By this means they divide the\ntwenty-four hours into seven watches instead of six, and thus\nshift the hours every night.  As the dog watches come during twilight,\nafter the day’s work is done, and before the night watch is set, they\nare the watches in which everybody is on deck.  The captain is up,\nwalking on the weather side of the quarter-deck, the chief mate is\non the lee side, and the second mate about the weather gangway.\nThe steward has finished his work in the cabin, and has come up to\nsmoke his pipe with the cook in the galley.  The crew are sitting on\nthe windlass or lying on the forecastle, smoking, singing, or telling\nlong yarns.  At eight o’clock, eight bells are struck, the log is hove,\nthe watch set, the wheel relieved, the galley shut up, and the other\nwatch goes below.",
        "The morning commences with the watch on deck’s “turning-to” at\nday-break and washing down, scrubbing, and swabbing the decks.\nThis, together with filling the “scuttled butt” with fresh water,\nand coiling up the rigging, usually occupies the time until seven\nbells, (half after seven,) when all hands get breakfast.  At eight,\nthe day’s work begins, and lasts until sun-down, with the exception\nof an hour for dinner.",
        "Before I end my explanations, it may be well to define a day’s work,\nand to correct a mistake prevalent among landsmen about a sailor’s\nlife.  Nothing is more common than to hear people say–\"Are not sailors\nvery idle at sea?–what can they find to do?”  This is a very natural\nmistake, and being very frequently made, it is one which every sailor\nfeels interested in having corrected.  In the first place, then, the\ndiscipline of the ship requires every man to be at work upon something\nwhen he is on deck, except at night and on Sundays.  Except at these\ntimes, you will never see a man, on board a well-ordered vessel,\nstanding idle on deck, sitting down, or leaning over the side.\nIt is the officers’ duty to keep every one at work, even if there\nis nothing to be done but to scrape the rust from the chain cables.\nIn no state prison are the convicts more regularly set to work, and\nmore closely watched.  No conversation is allowed among the crew at\ntheir duty, and though they frequently do talk when aloft, or when\nnear one another, yet they always stop when an officer is nigh.",
        "With regard to the work upon which the men are put, it is a matter\nwhich probably would not be understood by one who has not been at\nsea.  When I first left port, and found that we were kept regularly\nemployed for a week or two, I supposed that we were getting the vessel\ninto sea trim, and that it would soon be over, and we should have\nnothing to do but sail the ship; but I found that it continued so\nfor two years, and at the end of the two years there was as much to\nbe done as ever.  As has often been said, a ship is like a lady’s\nwatch, always out of repair.  When first leaving port, studding-sail\ngear is to be rove, all the running rigging to be examined, that\nwhich is unfit for use to be got down, and new rigging rove in its\nplace: then the standing rigging is to be overhauled, replaced,\nand repaired, in a thousand different ways; and wherever any of\nthe numberless ropes or the yards are chafing or wearing upon it,\nthere “chafing gear,” as it is called, must be put on.  This chafing\ngear consists of worming, parcelling, roundings, battens, and service\nof all kinds–both rope-yarns, spun-yarn, marline and seizing-stuffs.\nTaking off, putting on, and mending the chafing gear alone, upon a\nvessel, would find constant employment for two or three men, during\nworking hours, for a whole voyage.",
        "The next point to be considered is, that all the “small stuffs” which\nare used on board a ship–such as spun-yarn, marline, seizing-stuff,\netc.–are made on board.  The owners of a vessel buy up incredible\nquantities of “old junk,” which the sailors unlay, after drawing out\nthe yarns, knot them together, and roll them up in balls.  These\n\"rope-yarns” are constantly used for various purposes, but the\ngreater part is manufactured into spun-yarn.  For this purpose\nevery vessel is furnished with a “spun-yarn winch;” which is very\nsimple, consisting of a wheel and spindle.  This may be heard\nconstantly going on deck in pleasant weather; and we had employment,\nduring a great part of the time, for three hands in drawing and\nknotting yarns, and making them spun-yarn.",
        "Another method of employing the crew is, “setting up” rigging.\nWhenever any of the standing rigging becomes slack, (which is\ncontinually happening), the seizings and coverings must be taken\noff, tackles got up, and after the rigging is bowsed well taught,\nthe seizings and coverings replaced; which is a very nice piece of work.\nThere is also such a connection between different parts of a vessel,\nthat one rope can seldom be touched without altering another.\nYou cannot stay a mast aft by the back stays, without slacking up\nthe head stays, etc.  If we add to this all the tarring, greasing,\noiling, varnishing, painting, scraping, and scrubbing which is\nrequired in the course of a long voyage, and also remember this\nis all to be done in addition to watching at night, steering,\nreefing, furling, bracing, making and setting sail, and pulling,\nhauling, and climbing in every direction, one will hardly ask,\n\"What can a sailor find to do at sea?”",
        "If, after all this labor–after exposing their lives and limbs in\nstorms, wet and cold,",
        "   “Wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch;\n    The lion and the belly-pinched wolf\n    Keep their fur dry;–”",
        "the merchants and captain think that they have not earned their\ntwelve dollars a month, (out of which they clothe themselves,) and\ntheir salt beef and hard bread, they keep them picking oakum–\nad infinitum.  This is the usual resource upon a rainy day, for\nthen it will not do to work upon rigging; and when it is pouring\ndown in floods, instead of letting the sailors stand about in\nsheltered places, and talk, and keep themselves comfortable,\nthey are separated to different parts of the ship and kept at\nwork picking oakum.  I have seen oakum stuff placed about in\ndifferent parts of the ship, so that the sailors might not be\nidle in the snatches between the frequent squalls upon crossing\nthe equator.  Some officers have been so driven to find work for\nthe crew in a ship ready for sea, that they have set them to\npounding the anchors (often done) and scraping the chain cables.\nThe “Philadelphia Catechism” is,",
        "“Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able,\n And on the seventh–holystone the decks and scrape the cable.”",
        "This kind of work, of course, is not kept up off Cape Horn,\nCape of Good Hope, and in extreme north and south latitudes;\nbut I have seen the decks washed down and scrubbed, when the\nwater would have frozen if it had been fresh; and all hands\nkept at work upon the rigging, when we had on our pea-jackets,\nand our hands so numb that we could hardly hold our marline-spikes.",
        "I have here gone out of my narrative course in order that any who\nread this may form as correct an idea of a sailor’s life and duty\nas possible.  I have done it in this place because, for some time,\nour life was nothing but the unvarying repetition of these duties,\nwhich can be better described together.  Before leaving this\ndescription, however, I would state, in order to show landsmen how\nlittle they know of the nature of a ship, that a ship-carpenter\nis kept in constant employ during good weather on board vessels\nwhich are in, what is called, perfect sea order.",
        "After speaking the Carolina, on the 21st August, nothing occurred\nto break the monotony of our life until",
        "Friday, September 5th, when we saw a sail on our weather (starboard)\nbeam.  She proved to be a brig under English colors, and passing\nunder our stern, reported herself as forty-nine days from Buenos Ayres,\nbound to Liverpool.  Before she had passed us, “sail ho!” was cried again,\nand we made another sail, far on our weather bow, and steering athwart our\nhawse.  She passed out of hail, but we made her out to be an hermaphrodite\nbrig, with Brazilian colors in her main rigging.  By her course, she must\nhave been bound from Brazil to the south of Europe, probably Portugal.",
        "Sunday, Sept. 7th.  Fell in with the north-east trade winds.\nThis morning we caught our first dolphin, which I was very eager to see.\nI was disappointed in the colors of this fish when dying.  They were\ncertainly very beautiful, but not equal to what has been said of them.\nThey are too indistinct.  To do the fish justice, there is nothing more\nbeautiful than the dolphin when swimming a few feet below the surface,\non a bright day.  It is the most elegantly formed, and also the quickest\nfish, in salt water; and the rays of the sun striking upon it, in its\nrapid and changing motions, reflected from the water, make it look\nlike a stray beam from a rainbow.",
        "This day was spent like all pleasant Sabbaths at sea.  The decks are\nwashed down, the rigging coiled up, and everything put in order;\nand throughout the day, only one watch is kept on deck at a time.\nThe men are all dressed in their best white duck trowsers, and red\nor checked shirts, and have nothing to do but to make the necessary\nchanges in the sails.  They employ themselves in reading, talking,\nsmoking, and mending their clothes.  If the weather is pleasant,\nthey bring their work and their books upon deck, and sit down upon\nthe forecastle and windlass.  This is the only day on which these\nprivileges are allowed them.  When Monday comes, they put on their\ntarry trowsers again, and prepare for six days of labor.",
        "To enhance the value of the Sabbath to the crew, they are allowed on\nthat day a pudding, or, as it is called, a “duff.”  This is nothing\nmore than flour boiled with water, and eaten with molasses.  It is\nvery heavy, dark, and clammy, yet it is looked upon as a luxury,\nand really forms an agreeable variety with salt beef and pork.\nMany a rascally captain has made friends of his crew by allowing\nthem duff twice a week on the passage home.",
        "On board some vessels this is made a day of instruction and of\nreligious exercises; but we had a crew of swearers, from the\ncaptain to the smallest boy; and a day of rest, and of something\nlike quiet, social enjoyment, was all that we could expect.",
        "We continued running large before the north-east trade winds for\nseveral days, until Monday–",
        "September 22d; when, upon coming on deck at seven bells in the\nmorning, we found the other watch aloft throwing water upon the\nsails; and looking astern, we saw a small clipper-built brig with\na black hull heading directly after us.  We went to work immediately,\nand put all the canvas upon the brig which we could get upon her,\nrigging out oars for studding-sail yards; and continued wetting\ndown the sails by buckets of water whipped up to the mast-head,\nuntil about nine o’clock, when there came on a drizzling rain.\nThe vessel continued in pursuit, changing her course as we changed\nours, to keep before the wind.  The captain, who watched her with\nhis glass, said that she was armed, and full of men, and showed no\ncolors.  We continued running dead before the wind, knowing that\nwe sailed better so, and that clippers are fastest on the wind.\nWe had also another advantage.  The wind was light, and we spread\nmore canvas than she did, having royals and sky-sails fore and aft,\nand ten studding-sails; while she, being an hermaphrodite brig, had\nonly a gaff topsail, aft.  Early in the morning she was overhauling\nus a little, but after the rain came on and the wind grew lighter,\nwe began to leave her astern.  All hands remained on deck throughout\nthe day, and we got our arms in order; but we were too few to have\ndone anything with her, if she had proved to be what we feared.\nFortunately there was no moon, and the night which followed was\nexceedingly dark, so that by putting out all the lights and altering\nour course four points, we hoped to get out of her reach.  We had no\nlight in the binnacle, but steered by the stars, and kept perfect\nsilence through the night.  At daybreak there was no sign of anything\nin the horizon, and we kept the vessel off to her course.",
        "Wednesday, October 1st.  Crossed the equator in long. 24° 24’ W.\nI now, for the first time, felt at liberty, according to the old\nusage, to call myself a son of Neptune, and was very glad to be\nable to claim the title without the disagreeable initiation which\nso many have to go through.  After once crossing the line you can\nnever be subjected to the process, but are considered as a son of\nNeptune, with full powers to play tricks upon others.  This ancient\ncustom is now seldom allowed, unless there are passengers on board,\nin which case there is always a good deal of sport.",
        "It had been obvious to all hands for some time that the second mate,\nwhose name was F––-, was an idle, careless fellow, and not much of\na sailor, and that the captain was exceedingly dissatisfied with him.\nThe power of the captain in these cases was well known, and we all\nanticipated a difficulty.  F––- (called Mr. by virtue of his office)\nwas but half a sailor, having always been short voyages and remained at\nhome a long time between them.  His father was a man of some property,\nand intended to have given his son a liberal education; but he, being\nidle and worthless, was sent off to sea, and succeeded no better there;\nfor, unlike many scamps, he had none of the qualities of a sailor–\nhe was “not of the stuff that they make sailor of.”  He was one of that\nclass of officers who are disliked by their captain and despised by the\ncrew.  He used to hold long yarns with the crew, and talk about the\ncaptain, and play with the boys, and relax discipline in every way.\nThis kind of conduct always makes the captain suspicious, and is never\npleasant, in the end, to the men; they preferring to have an officer\nactive, vigilant, and distant as may be, with kindness.  Among other bad\npractices, he frequently slept on his watch, and having been discovered\nasleep by the captain, he was told that he would be turned off duty if\nhe did it again.  To prevent it in every way possible, the hen-coops\nwere ordered to be knocked up, for the captain never sat down on deck\nhimself, and never permitted an officer to do so.",
        "The second night after crossing the equator, we had the watch from\neight till twelve, and it was “my helm” for the last two hours.\nThere had been light squalls through the night, and the captain\ntold Mr. F––-, who commanded our watch, to keep a bright look-out.\nSoon after I came to the helm, I found that he was quite drowsy,\nand at last he stretched himself on the companion and went fast asleep.\nSoon afterwards, the captain came very quietly on deck, and stood\nby me for some time looking at the compass.  The officer at length\nbecame aware of the captain’s presence, but pretending not to know it,\nbegan humming and whistling to himself, to show that he was not asleep,\nand went forward, without looking behind him, and ordered the main\nroyal to be loosed.  On turning round to come aft, he pretended\nsurprise at seeing the master on deck.  This would not do.\nThe captain was too “wide awake” for him, and beginning upon him\nat once, gave him a grand blow-up, in true nautical style–\"You’re\na lazy, good-for-nothing rascal; you’re neither man, boy, soger,\nnor sailor! you’re no more than a thing aboard a vessel! you don’t\nearn your salt! you’re worse than a Mahon soger!” and other still\nmore choice extracts from the sailor’s vocabulary.  After the poor\nfellow had taken the harangue, he was sent into his state-room,\nand the captain stood the rest of the watch himself.",
        "At seven bells in the morning, all hands were called aft and told\nthat F––- was no longer an officer on board, and that we might\nchoose one of our own number for second mate.  It is usual for the\ncaptain to make this offer, and it is very good policy, for the\ncrew think themselves the choosers and are flattered by it, but have\nto obey, nevertheless.  Our crew, as is usual, refused to take the\nresponsibility of choosing a man of whom we would never be able\nto complain, and left it to the captain.  He picked out an active\nand intelligent young sailor, born near the Kennebee, who had been\nseveral Canton voyages, and proclaimed him in the following manner:\n\"I choose Jim Hall–he’s your second mate.  All you’ve got to do is,\nto obey him as you would me; and remember that he is Mr. Hall.\"\nF––- went forward into the forecastle as a common sailor, and lost\nthe handle to his name, while young fore-mast Jim became Mr. Hall,\nand took up his quarters in the land of knives and forks and tea-cups.",
        "Sunday, October 5th.  It was our morning watch; when, soon after the\nday began to break, a man on the forecastle called out, “Land ho!\"\nI had never heard the cry before, and did not know what it meant,\n(and few would suspect what the words were, when hearing the strange\nsound for the first time,) but I soon found, by the direction of\nall eyes, that there was land stretching along our weather beam.\nWe immediately took in studding-sails and hauled our wind, running in\nfor the land.  This was done to determine our longitude; for by the\ncaptain’s chronometer we were in 25º W., but by his observations we\nwere much farther, and he had been for some time in doubt whether\nit was his chronometer or his sextant which was out of order.\nThis land-fall settled the matter, and the former instrument was\ncondemned, and becoming still worse, was never afterwards used.",
        "As we ran in towards the coast, we found that we were directly off\nthe port of Pernambuco, and could see with the telescope the roofs\nof the houses, and one large church, and the town of Olinda.  We ran\nalong by the mouth of the harbor, and saw a full-rigged brig going in.\nAt two, P.M., we again kept off before the wind, leaving the land on\nour quarter, and at sun-down, it was out of sight.  It was here that\nI first saw one of those singular things called catamarans.  They are\ncomposed of logs lashed together upon the water; have one large sail,\nare quite fast, and, strange as it may seem, are trusted as good\nsea boats.  We saw several, with from one to three men in each,\nboldly putting out to sea, after it had become almost dark. \nThe Indians go out in them after fish, and as the weather is\nregular in certain seasons, they have no fear.  After taking a\nnew departure from Olinda, we kept off on our way to Cape Horn.",
        "We met with nothing remarkable until we were in the latitude of the\nriver La Plata.  Here there are violent gales from the south-west,\ncalled Pomperos, which are very destructive to the shipping in the\nriver, and are felt for many leagues at sea.  They are usually\npreceded by lightning.  The captain told the mates to keep a bright\nlook-out, and if they saw lightning at the south-west, to take in\nsail at once.  We got the first touch of one during my watch on deck.\nI was walking in the lee gangway, and thought that I saw lightning\non the lee bow.  I told the second mate, who came over and looked\nout for some time.  It was very black in the south-west, and in\nabout ten minutes we saw a distinct flash.  The wind, which had\nbeen south-east, had now left us, and it was dead calm.  We sprang\naloft immediately and furled the royals and top-gallant-sails,\nand took in the flying jib, hauled up the mainsail and trysail,\nsquared the after yards, and awaited the attack.  A huge mist\ncapped with black clouds came driving towards us, extending over\nthat quarter of the horizon, and covering the stars, which shone\nbrightly in the other part of the heavens.  It came upon us at\nonce with a blast, and a shower of hail and rain, which almost\ntook our breath from us.  The hardiest was obliged to turn his back.\nWe let the halyards run, and fortunately were not taken aback.\nThe little vessel “paid off” from the wind, and ran on for some\ntime directly before it, tearing through the water with everything\nflying.  Having called all hands, we close-reefed the topsails and\ntrysail, furled the courses and job, set the fore-top-mast staysail,\nand brought her up nearly to her course, with the weather braces\nhauled in a little, to ease her.",
        "This was the first blow, that I had seen, which could really be\ncalled a gale.  We had reefed our topsails in the Gulf Stream, and\nI thought it something serious, but an older sailor would have thought\nnothing of it.  As I had now become used to the vessel and to my duty,\nI was of some service on a yard, and could knot my reef-point as\nwell as anybody.  I obeyed the order to lay(1) aloft with the rest,",
        "–––––––––––––––\n1. This word “lay,” which is in such general use on board ship,\n   being used in giving orders instead of “go\"; as “Lay forward!\"\n   “Lay aft!” “Lay aloft!” etc., I do not understand to be the\n   neuter verb, lie, mispronounced, but to be the active verb lay,\n   with the objective case understood; as “Lay yourselves forwards!\"\n   “Lay yourselves aft!” etc.\n–––––––––––––––",
        "and found the reefing a very exciting scene; for one watch reefed the\nfore-topsail, and the other the main, and every one did his utmost to\nget his topsail hoisted first.  We had a great advantage over the\nlarboard watch, because the chief mate never goes aloft, while our\nnew second mate used to jump into the rigging as soon as we began to\nhaul out the reef-tackle, and have the weather earing passed before\nthere was a man upon the yard.  In this way we were almost always\nable to raise the cry of “Haul out to leeward” before them, and having\nknotted our points, would slide down the shrouds and back-stays,\nand sing out at the topsail halyards to let it be known that we were\nahead of them.  Reefing is the most exciting part of a sailor’s duty.\nAll hands are engaged upon it, and after the halyards are let go,\nthere is no time to be lost–no “sogering,” or hanging back, then.\nIf one is not quick enough, another runs over him.  The first on the\nyard goes to the weather earing, the second to the lee, and the next\ntwo to the “dog’s ears;” while the others lay along into the bunt,\njust giving each other elbow-room.  In reefing, the yard-arms\n(the extremes of the yards) are the posts of honor; but in furling,\nthe strongest and most experienced stand in the slings, (or, middle\nof the yard,) to make up the bunt.  If the second mate is a smart\nfellow, he will never let any one take either of these posts from him;\nbut if he is wanting either in seamanship, strength, or activity,\nsome better man will get the bunt and earings from him; which\nimmediately brings him into disrepute.",
        "We remained for the rest of the night, and throughout the next day,\nunder the same close sail, for it continued to blow very fresh;\nand though we had no more hail, yet there was a soaking rain,\nand it was quite cold and uncomfortable; the more so, because we\nwere not prepared for cold weather, but had on our thin clothes.\nWe were glad to get a watch below, and put on our thick clothing,\nboots, and south-westers.  Towards sun-down the gale moderated\na little, and it began to clear off in the south-west.  We shook\nour reefs out, one by one, and before midnight had top-gallant\nsails upon her.",
        "We had now made up our minds for Cape Horn and cold weather,\nand entered upon every necessary preparation.",
        "Tuesday, Nov. 4th.  At day-break, saw land upon our larboard quarter.\nThere were two islands, of different size but of the same shape;\nrather high, beginning low at the water’s edge, and running with\na curved ascent to the middle.  They were so far off as to be of\na deep blue color, and in a few hours we sank them in the north-east.\nThese were the Falkland Islands.  We had run between them and the\nmain land of Patagonia.  At sun-set the second mate, who was at\nthe masthead, said that he saw land on the starboard bow.  This must\nhave been the island of Staten Land; and we were now in the region\nof Cape Horn, with a fine breeze from the northward, top-mast and\ntop-gallant studding-sails set, and every prospect of a speedy and\npleasant passage round.",
        "Wednesday, Nov. 5th.  The weather was fine during the previous night,\nand we had a clear view of the Magellan Clouds, and of the Southern Cross.\nThe Magellan Clouds consist of three small nebulae in the southern\npart of the heavens,–two bright, like the milky-way, and one dark.\nThese are first seen, just above the horizon, soon after crossing\nthe southern tropic.  When off Cape Horn, they are nearly overhead.\nThe cross is composed of four stars in that form, and is said to be\nthe brightest constellation in the heavens.",
        "During the first part of this day (Wednesday) the wind was light,\nbut after noon it came on fresh, and we furled the royals.  We still\nkept the studding-sails out, and the captain said he should go round\nwith them, if he could.  Just before eight o’clock, (then about sun-down,\nin that latitude,) the cry of “All hands ahoy!” was sounded down\nthe fore scuttle and the after hatchway, and hurrying upon deck,\nwe found a large black cloud rolling on toward us from the south-west,\nand blackening the whole heavens.  “Here comes the Cape Horn!” said\nthe chief mate; and we had hardly time to haul down and clew up,\nbefore it was upon us.  In a few moments, a heavier sea was raised\nthan I had ever seen before, and as it was directly ahead, the little\nbrig, which was no better than a bathing machine, plunged into it,\nand all the forward part of her was under water; the sea pouring in\nthrough the bow-ports and hawse-hole and over the knight-heads,\nthreatening to wash everything overboard.  In the lee scuppers it\nwas up to a man’s waist.  We sprang aloft and double reefed the\ntopsails, and furled all the other sails, and made all snug.\nBut this would not do; the brig was laboring and straining against\nthe head sea, and the gale was growing worse and worse.  At the same\ntime the sleet and hail were driving with all fury against us.\nWe clewed down, and hauled out the reef-tackles again, and close-reefed\nthe fore-topsail, and furled the main, and hove her to on the starboard\ntack.  Here was an end to our fine prospects.  We made up our minds to\nhead winds and cold weather; sent down the royal yards, and unrove\nthe gear, but all the rest of the top hamper remained aloft, even to\nthe sky-sail masts and studding-sail booms.",
        "Throughout the night it stormed violently–rain, hail, snow, and\nsleet beating down upon the vessel–the wind continuing to break ahead,\nand the sea running high.  At daybreak (about three, A.M.) the deck\nwas covered with snow.  The captain sent up the steward with a glass\nof grog to each of the watch; and all the time that we were off the Cape,\ngrog was given to the morning watch, and to all hands whenever we reefed\ntopsails.  The clouds cleared away at sun-rise, and the wind becoming\nmore fair, we again made sail and stood nearly up to our course.",
        "Thursday, Nov. 6th.  It continued more pleasant through the first\npart of the day, but at night we had the same scene over again.\nThis time, we did not heave to, as on the night before, but endeavored\nto beat to windward under close-reefed top-sails, balance-reefed trysail,\nand fore top-mast stay-sail.  This night it was my turn to steer, or,\nas the sailors say, my trick at the helm, for two hours.  Inexperienced\nas I was, I made out to steer to the satisfaction of the officer,\nand neither S––- nor myself gave up our tricks, all the time that\nwe were off the Cape.  This was something to boast of, for it requires\na good deal of skill and watchfulness to steer a vessel close hauled,\nin a gale of wind, against a heavy head sea.  “Ease her when she pitches,\"\nis the word; and a little carelessness in letting her ship a heavy sea,\nmight sweep the decks, or knock masts out of her.",
        "Friday, Nov. 7th.  Towards morning the wind went down, and during\nthe whole forenoon we lay tossing about in a dead calm, and in the\nmidst of a thick fog.  The calms here are unlike those in most parts\nof the world, for there is always such a high sea running, and the\nperiods of calm are so short, that it has no time to go down;\nand vessels, being under no command of sails or rudder, lie like\nlogs upon the water.  We were obliged to steady the booms and yards\nby guys and braces, and to lash everything well below.  We now found\nour top hamper of some use, for though it is liable to be carried\naway or sprung by the sudden “bringing up” of a vessel when pitching\nin a chopping sea, yet it is a great help in steadying a vessel when\nrolling in a long swell; giving it more slowness, ease, and regularity\nto the motion.",
        "The calm of the morning reminds me of a scene which I forgot to\ndescribe at the time of its occurrence, but which I remember from\nits being the first time that I had heard the near breathing of whales.\nIt was on the night that we passed between the Falkland Islands and\nStaten Land.  We had the watch from twelve to four, and coming upon deck,\nfound the little brig lying perfectly still, surrounded by a thick fog,\nand the sea as smooth as though oil had been poured upon it; yet now\nand then a long, low swell rolling over its surface, slightly lifting\nthe vessel, but without breaking the glassy smoothness of the water.\nWe were surrounded far and near by shoals of sluggish whales and\ngrampuses; which the fog prevented our seeing, rising slowly to the\nsurface, or perhaps lying out at length, heaving out those peculiar\nlazy, deep, and long-drawn breathings which give such an impression\nof supineness and strength.  Some of the watch were asleep, and the\nothers were perfectly still, so that there was nothing to break the\nillusion, and I stood leaning over the bulwarks, listening to the\nslow breathing of the mighty creatures–now one breaking the water\njust alongside, whose black body I almost fancied that I could see\nthrough the fog; and again another, which I could just hear in the\ndistance–until the low and regular swell seemed like the heaving\nof the ocean’s mighty bosom to the sound of its heavy and long-drawn\nrespirations.",
        "Towards the evening of this day, (Friday 7th,) the fog cleared off,\nand we had every appearance of a cold blow; and soon after sun-down\nit came on.  Again it was clew up and haul down, reef and furl,\nuntil we had got her down to close-reefed topsails, double-reefed\ntrysail, and reefed forespenser.  Snow, hail, and sleet were driving\nupon us most of the night, and the sea was breaking over the bows\nand covering the forward part of the little vessel; but as she would\nlay her course the captain refused to heave her to.",
        "Saturday, Nov. 8th.  This day commenced with calm and thick fog,\nand ended with hail, snow, a violent wind, and close-reefed topsails.",
        "Sunday, Nov. 9th.  To-day the sun rose clear and continued so until\ntwelve o’clock, when the captain got an observation.  This was very\nwell for Cape Horn, and we thought it a little remarkable that,\nas we had not had one unpleasant Sunday during the whole voyage,\nthe only tolerable day here should be a Sunday.  We got time to\nclear up the steerage and forecastle, and set things to rights,\nand to overhaul our wet clothes a little.  But this did not last\nvery long.  Between five and six–the sun was then nearly three\nhours high–the cry of “All starbowlines ahoy!” summoned our watch\non deck; and immediately all hands were called.  A true specimen\nof Cape Horn was coming upon us.  A great cloud of a dark slate-color\nwas driving on us from the south-west; and we did our best to take\nin sail, (for the light sails had been set during the first part of\nthe day,) before we were in the midst of it.  We had got the light\nsails furled, the courses hauled up, and the topsail reef-tackles\nhauled out, and were just mounting the fore-rigging, when the storm\nstruck us.  In an instant the sea, which had been comparatively quiet,\nwas running higher and higher; and it became almost as dark as night.\nThe hail and sleet were harder than I had yet felt them; seeming to\nalmost pin us down to the rigging.  We were longer taking in sail\nthan ever before; for the sails were stiff and wet, the ropes and\nrigging covered with snow and sleet, and we ourselves cold and nearly\nblinded with the violence of the storm.  By the time we had got down\nupon deck again, the little brig was plunging madly into a tremendous\nhead sea, which at every drive rushed in through the bow-ports and\nover the bows, and buried all the forward part of the vessel.  At this\ninstant the chief mate, who was standing on the top of the windlass,\nat the foot of the spenser mast, called out, “Lay out there and furl\nthe jib!”  This was no agreeable or safe duty, yet it must be done.\nAn old Swede, (the best sailor on board,) who belonged on the forecastle,\nsprang out upon the bowsprit.  Another one must go: I was near the mate,\nand sprang forward, threw the down-haul over the windlass, and jumped\nbetween the knight-heads out upon the bowsprit.  The crew stood abaft\nthe windlass and hauled the jib down, while we got out upon the weather\nside of the jib-boom, our feet on the foot ropes, holding on by the spar,\nthe great jib flying off to leeward and slatting so as almost to throw\nus off of the boom.  For some time we could do nothing but hold on,\nand the vessel diving into two huge seas, one after the other, plunged us\ntwice into the water up to our chins.  We hardly knew whether we were\non or off; when coming up, dripping from the water, we were raised high\ninto the air.  John (that was the sailor’s name) thought the boom\nwould go, every moment, and called out to the mate to keep the vessel\noff, and haul down the staysail; but the fury of the wind and the\nbreaking of the seas against the bows defied every attempt to make\nourselves heard, and we were obliged to do the best we could in our\nsituation.  Fortunately, no other seas so heavy struck her, and we\nsucceeded in furling the jib “after a fashion\"; and, coming in over\nthe staysail nettings, were not a little pleased to find that all\nwas snug, and the watch gone below; for we were soaked through,\nand it was very cold.  The weather continued nearly the same\nthrough the night.",
        "Monday, Nov. 10th.  During a part of this day we were hove to,\nbut the rest of the time were driving on, under close-reefed sails,\nwith a heavy sea, a strong gale, and frequent squalls of hail and snow.",
        "Tuesday, Nov. 11th.  The same.",
        "Wednesday, Nov. 12th.  The same.",
        "Thursday, Nov. 13th.  The same.",
        "We had now got hardened to Cape weather, the vessel was under\nreduced sail, and everything secured on deck and below, so that\nwe had little to do but steer and to stand our watch.  Our clothes\nwere all wet through, and the only change was from wet to more wet.\nIt was in vain to think of reading or working below, for we were\ntoo tired, the hatchways were closed down, and everything was wet\nand uncomfortable, black and dirty, heaving and pitching.  We had\nonly to come below when the watch was out, wring out our wet clothes,\nhang them up, and turn in and sleep as soundly as we could, until the\nwatch was called again.  A sailor can sleep anywhere–no sound of\nwind, water, wood or iron can keep him awake–and we were always\nfast asleep when three blows on the hatchway, and the unwelcome\ncry of “All starbowlines ahoy! eight bells there below! do you\nhear the news?” (the usual formula of calling the watch), roused us\nup from our berths upon the cold, wet decks.  The only time when we\ncould be said to take any pleasure was at night and morning, when we\nwere allowed a tin pot full of hot tea, (or, as the sailors significantly\ncall it, “water bewitched,”) sweetened with molasses.  This, bad as\nit was, was still warm and comforting, and, together with our sea\nbiscuit and cold salt beef, made quite a meal.  Yet even this meal\nwas attended with some uncertainty.  We had to go ourselves to the\ngalley and take our kid of beef and tin pots of tea, and run the\nrisk of losing them before we could get below.  Many a kid of beef\nhave I seen rolling in the scuppers, and the bearer lying at his\nlength on the decks.  I remember an English lad who was always the\nlife of the crew, but whom we afterwards lost overboard, standing for\nnearly ten minutes at the galley, with this pot of tea in his hand,\nwaiting for a chance to get down into the forecastle; and seeing\nwhat he thought was a “smooth spell,” started to go forward.  He had\njust got to the end of the windlass, when a great sea broke over the\nbows, and for a moment I saw nothing of him but his head and shoulders;\nand at the next instant, being taken off of his legs, he was carried\naft with the sea, until her stern lifting up and sending the water\nforward, he was left high and dry at the side of the long-boat,\nstill holding on to his tin pot, which had now nothing in it but\nsalt water.  But nothing could ever daunt him, or overcome, for a\nmoment, his habitual good humor.  Regaining his legs, and shaking\nhis fist at the man at the wheel, he rolled below, saying, as he\npassed, “A man’s no sailor, if he can’t take a joke.”  The ducking\nwas not the worst of such an affair, for, as there was an allowance\nof tea, you could get no more from the galley; and though sailors\nwould never suffer a man to go without, but would always turn in\na little from their own pots to fill up his, yet this was at best\nbut dividing the loss among all hands.",
        "Something of the same kind befell me a few days after.  The cook\nhad just made for us a mess of hot “scouse\"–that is, biscuit pounded\nfine, salt beef cut into small pieces, and a few potatoes, boiled up\ntogether and seasoned with pepper.  This was a rare treat, and I,\nbeing the last at the galley, had it put in my charge to carry down\nfor the mess.  I got along very well as far as the hatchway, and was\njust getting down the steps, when a heavy sea, lifting the stern out\nof water, and passing forward, dropping it down again, threw the steps\nfrom their place, and I came down into the steerage a little faster\nthan I meant to, with the kid on top of me, and the whole precious\nmess scattered over the floor.  Whatever your feelings may be,\nyou must make a joke of everything at sea; and if you were to fall\nfrom aloft and be caught in the belly of a sail, and thus saved\nfrom instant death, it would not do to look at all disturbed,\nor to make a serious matter of it.",
        "Friday, Nov. 14th.  We were now well to the westward of the Cape\nand were changing our course to the northward as much as we dared,\nsince the strong south-west winds, which prevailed then, carried us\nin toward Patagonia.  At two, P.M., we saw a sail on our larboard beam,\nand at four we made it out to be a large ship, steering our course,\nunder single-reefed topsails.  We at that time had shaken the reefs\nout of our topsails, as the wind was lighter, and set the main\ntop-gallant sail.  As soon as our captain saw what sail she was under,\nhe set the fore top-gallant sail and flying jib; and the old whaler–\nfor such, his boats and short sail showed him to be–felt a little\nashamed, and shook the reefs out of his topsails, but could do no more,\nfor he had sent down his top-gallant masts off the Cape.  He ran down\nfor us, and answered our hail as the whale-ship, New England,\nof Poughkeepsie, one hundred and twenty days from New York.\nOur captain gave our name, and added, ninety-two days from Boston.\nThey then had a little conversation about longitude, in which they\nfound that they could not agree.  The ship fell astern, and continued\nin sight during the night.  Toward morning, the wind having become\nlight, we crossed our royal and skysail yards, and at daylight we\nwere seen under a cloud of sail, having royal and skysails fore\nand aft.  The “spouter,” as the sailors call a whaleman, had sent\nup his main top-gallant mast and set the sail, and made signal for\nus to heave to.  About half-past seven their whale-boat came alongside,\nand Captain Job Terry sprang on board, a man known in every port and\nby every vessel in the Pacific ocean.  “Don’t you know Job Terry?\nI thought everybody knew Job Terry,” said a green-hand, who came in\nthe boat, to me, when I asked him about his captain.  He was indeed\na singular man.  He was six feet high, wore thick, cowhide boots,\nand brown coat and trowsers, and, except a sun-burnt complexion,\nhad not the slightest appearance of a sailor; yet he had been forty\nyears in the whale trade, and, as he said himself, had owned ships,\nbuilt ships, and sailed ships.  His boat’s crew were a pretty raw set,\njust out of the bush, and as the sailor’s phrase is, “hadn’t got the\nhayseed out of their hair.”  Captain Terry convinced our captain that\nour reckoning was a little out, and, having spent the day on board,\nput off in his boat at sunset for his ship, which was now six or\neight miles astern.  He began a “yarn” when he came on board,\nwhich lasted, with but little intermission, for four hours.\nIt was all about himself, and the Peruvian government, and the\nDublin frigate, and Lord James Townshend, and President Jackson,\nand the ship Ann M’Kim of Baltimore.  It would probably never have\ncome to an end, had not a good breeze sprung up, which sent him off\nto his own vessel.  One of the lads who came in his boat, a thoroughly\ncountrified-looking fellow, seemed to care very little about the vessel,\nrigging, or anything else, but went round looking at the live stock,\nand leaned over the pig-sty, and said he wished he was back again\ntending his father’s pigs.",
        "At eight o’clock we altered our course to the northward, bound for\nJuan Fernandez.",
        "This day we saw the last of the albatrosses, which had been our\ncompanions a great part of the time off the Cape.  I had been\ninterested in the bird from descriptions which I had read of it,\nand was not at all disappointed.  We caught one or two with a\nbaited hook which we floated astern upon a shingle.  Their long,\nflapping wings, long legs, and large, staring eyes, give them a\nvery peculiar appearance.  They look well on the wing; but one\nof the finest sights that I have ever seen, was an albatross\nasleep upon the water, during a calm, off Cape Horn, when a heavy\nsea was running.  There being no breeze, the surface of the water\nwas unbroken, but a long, heavy swell was rolling, and we saw the\nfellow, all white, directly ahead of us, asleep upon the waves,\nwith his head under his wing; now rising on the top of a huge billow,\nand then falling slowly until he was lost in the hollow between.\nHe was undisturbed for some time, until the noise of our bows,\ngradually approaching, roused him, when, lifting his head, he stared\nupon us for a moment, and then spread his wide wings and took his flight.",
        "Monday, Nov. 19th.  This was a black day in our calendar.  At seven\no’clock in the morning, it being our watch below, we were aroused\nfrom a sound sleep by the cry of “All hands ahoy! a man overboard!\"\nThis unwonted cry sent a thrill through the heart of every one,\nand hurrying on deck we found the vessel hove flat aback, with all\nher studding-sails set; for the boy who was at the helm left it to\nthrow something overboard, and the carpenter, who was an old sailor,\nknowing that the wind was light, put the helm down and hove her aback.\nThe watch on deck were lowering away the quarter-boat, and I got on\ndeck just in time to heave myself into her as she was leaving the side;\nbut it was not until out upon the wide Pacific, in our little boat,\nthat I knew whom we had lost.  It was George Ballmer, a young English\nsailor, who was prized by the officers as an active lad and willing\nseaman, and by the crew as a lively, hearty fellow, and a good shipmate.\nHe was going aloft to fit a strap round the main top-mast-head,\nfor ringtail halyards, and had the strap and block, a coil of halyards\nand a marline-spike about his neck.  He fell from the starboard futtock\nshrouds, and not knowing how to swim, and being heavily dressed, with all\nthose things round his neck, he probably sank immediately.  We pulled\nastern, in the direction in which he fell, and though we knew that there\nwas no hope of saving him, yet no one wished to speak of returning, and we\nrowed about for nearly an hour, without the hope of doing anything,\nbut unwilling to acknowledge to ourselves that we must give him up.\nAt length we turned the boat’s head and made towards the vessel.",
        "Death is at all times solemn, but never so much so as at sea.  A man\ndies on shore; his body remains with his friends, and “the mourners go\nabout the streets;” but when a man falls overboard at sea and is lost,\nthere is a suddenness in the event, and a difficulty in realizing it,\nwhich give to it an air of awful mystery.  A man dies on shore–you\nfollow his body to the grave, and a stone marks the spot.  You are\noften prepared for the event.  There is always something which helps\nyou to realize it when it happens, and to recall it when it has passed.\nA man is shot down by your side in battle, and the mangled body remains\nan object, and a real evidence; but at sea, the man is near you–\nat your side–you hear his voice, and in an instant he is gone, and\nnothing but a vacancy shows his loss.  Then, too, at sea–to use\na homely but expressive phrase–you miss a man so much.  A dozen\nmen are shut up together in a little bark, upon the wide, wide sea,\nand for months and months see no forms and hear no voices but their\nown, and one is taken suddenly from among them, and they miss him\nat every turn.  It is like losing a limb.  There are no new faces\nor new scenes to fill up the gap.  There is always an empty berth\nin the forecastle, and one man wanting when the small night watch\nis mustered.  There is one less to take the wheel, and one less to\nlay out with you upon the yard.  You miss his form, and the sound\nof his voice, for habit had made them almost necessary to you, and\neach of your senses feels the loss.",
        "All these things make such a death peculiarly solemn, and the effect\nof it remains upon the crew for some time.  There is more kindness\nshown by the officers to the crew, and by the crew to one another.\nThere is more quietness and seriousness.  The oath and the loud\nlaugh are gone.  The officers are more watchful, and the crew go\nmore carefully aloft.  The lost man is seldom mentioned, or is\ndismissed with a sailor’s rude eulogy–\"Well, poor George is gone!\nHis cruise is up soon!  He knew his work, and did his duty, and was\na good shipmate.”  Then usually follows some allusion to another world,\nfor sailors are almost all believers; but their notions and opinions\nare unfixed and at loose ends.  They say,–\"God won’t be hard upon\nthe poor fellow,” and seldom get beyond the common phrase which seems\nto imply that their sufferings and hard treatment here will excuse\nthem hereafter,–\"To work hard, live hard, die hard, and go to hell\nafter all, would be hard indeed!”  Our cook, a simple-hearted old\nAfrican, who had been through a good deal in his day, and was rather\nseriously inclined, always going to church twice a day when on shore,\nand reading his Bible on a Sunday in the galley, talked to the crew\nabout spending their Sabbaths badly, and told them that they might\ngo as suddenly as George had, and be as little prepared.",
        "Yet a sailor’s life is at best, but a mixture of a little good with\nmuch evil, and a little pleasure with much pain.  The beautiful is\nlinked with the revolting, the sublime with the commonplace, and the\nsolemn with the ludicrous.",
        "We had hardly returned on board with our sad report, before an\nauction was held of the poor man’s clothes.  The captain had first,\nhowever, called all hands aft and asked them if they were satisfied\nthat everything had been done to save the man, and if they thought\nthere was any use in remaining there longer.  The crew all said that\nit was in vain, for the man did not know how to swim, and was very\nheavily dressed.  So we then filled away and kept her off to her course.",
        "The laws regulating navigation make the captain answerable for the\neffects of a sailor who dies during the voyage, and it is either a law\nor a universal custom, established for convenience, that the captain\nshould immediately hold an auction of his things, in which they are\nbid off by the sailors, and the sums which they give are deducted from\ntheir wages at the end of the voyage.  In this way the trouble and\nrisk of keeping his things through the voyage are avoided, and the\nclothes are usually sold for more than they would be worth on shore.\nAccordingly, we had no sooner got the ship before the wind, than\nhis chest was brought up upon the forecastle, and the sale began.\nThe jackets and trowsers in which we had seen him dressed but a few\ndays before, were exposed and bid off while the life was hardly out\nof his body, and his chest was taken aft and used as a store-chest,\nso that there was nothing left which could be called his.  Sailors have\nan unwillingness to wear a dead man’s clothes during the same voyage,\nand they seldom do so unless they are in absolute want.",
        "As is usual after a death, many stories were told about George.\nSome had heard him say that he repented never having learned to swim,\nand that he knew that he should meet his death by drowning.  Another\nsaid that he never knew any good to come of a voyage made against\nthe will, and the deceased man shipped and spent his advance and\nwas afterwards very unwilling to go, but not being able to refund,\nwas obliged to sail with us.  A boy, too, who had become quite\nattached to him, said that George talked to him during most of\nthe watch on the night before, about his mother and family at home,\nand this was the first time that he had mentioned the subject during\nthe voyage.",
        "The night after this event, when I went to the galley to get a light,\nI found the cook inclined to be talkative, so I sat down on the spars,\nand gave him an opportunity to hold a yarn.  I was the more inclined\nto do so, as I found that he was full of the superstitions once more\ncommon among seamen, and which the recent death had waked up in his mind.\nHe talked about George’s having spoken of his friends, and said he\nbelieved few men died without having a warning of it, which he supported\nby a great many stories of dreams, and the unusual behavior of men before\ndeath.  From this he went on to other superstitions, the Flying Dutchman,\netc., and talked rather mysteriously, having something evidently on his mind.",
        "At length he put his head out of the galley and looked carefully about to\nsee if any one was within hearing, and being satisfied on that point, asked\nme in a low tone–",
        "“I say! you know what countryman ’e carpenter be?”",
        "“Yes,” said I; “he’s a German.”",
        "“What kind of a German?” said the cook.",
        "“He belongs to Bremen,” said I.",
        "“Are you sure o’ dat?” said he.",
        "I satisfied him on that point by saying that he could speak no\nlanguage but the German and English.",
        "“I’m plaguy glad o’ dat,” said the cook.  “I was mighty ’fraid he was a\nFin.  I tell you what, I been plaguy civil to that man all the voyage.”",
        "I asked him the reason of this, and found that he was fully possessed\nwith the notion that Fins are wizards, and especially have power over\nwinds and storms.  I tried to reason with him about it, but he had the\nbest of all arguments, that from experience, at hand, and was not to\nbe moved.  He had been in a vessel at the Sandwich Islands, in which\nthe sail-maker was a Fin, and could do anything he was of a mind to.\nThis sail-maker kept a junk bottle in his berth, which was always just\nhalf full of rum, though he got drunk upon it nearly every day.  He had\nseen him sit for hours together, talking to this bottle, which he stood\nup before him on the table.  The same man cut his throat in his berth,\nand everybody said he was possessed.",
        "He had heard of ships, too, beating up the gulf of Finland against\na head wind, and having a ship heave in sight astern, overhaul and\npass them, with as fair a wind as could blow, and all studding-sails\nout, and find she was from Finland.",
        "“Oh ho!” said he; “I’ve seen too much of them men to want to see ’em\n’board a ship.  If they can’t have their own way, they’ll play the\nd–-l with you.”",
        "As I still doubted, he said he would leave it to John, who was the\noldest seaman aboard, and would know, if anybody did.  John, to be\nsure, was the oldest, and at the same time the most ignorant, man\nin the ship; but I consented to have him called.  The cook stated\nthe matter to him, and John, as I anticipated, sided with the cook,\nand said that he himself had been in a ship where they had a head\nwind for a fortnight, and the captain found out at last that one\nof the men, whom he had had some hard words with a short time before,\nwas a Fin, and immediately told him if he didn’t stop the head wind\nhe would shut him down in the fore peak, and would not give him\nanything to eat.  The Fin held out for a day and a half, when he\ncould not stand it any longer, and did something or other which\nbrought the wind round again, and they let him up.",
        "“There,” said the cook, “what do you think o’ dat?”",
        "I told him I had no doubt it was true, and that it would have been\nodd if the wind had not changed in fifteen days, Fin or no Fin.",
        "“Oh,” says he, “go ’way!  You think, ’cause you been to college,\nyou know better than anybody.  You know better than them as ’as\nseen it with their own eyes.  You wait till you’ve been to sea as\nlong as I have, and you’ll know.”",
        "We continued sailing along with a fair wind and fine weather until",
        "Tuesday, Nov. 25th, when at daylight we saw the island of\nJuan Fernandez, directly ahead, rising like a deep blue cloud out\nof the sea.  We were then probably nearly seventy miles from it;\nand so high and so blue did it appear, that I mistook it for a cloud,\nresting over the island, and looked for the island under it, until it\ngradually turned to a deader and greener color, and I could mark the\ninequalities upon its surface.  At length we could distinguish trees\nand rocks; and by the afternoon, this beautiful island lay fairly\nbefore us, and we directed our course to the only harbor.  Arriving at\nthe entrance soon after sun-down, we found a Chilian man-of-war brig,\nthe only vessel, coming out.  She hailed us, and an officer on board,\nwhom we supposed to be an American, advised us to run in before night,\nand said that they were bound to Valparaiso.  We ran immediately for\nthe anchorage, but, owing to the winds which drew about the mountains\nand came to us in flaws from every point of the compass, we did not\ncome to an anchor until nearly midnight.  We had a boat ahead all the\ntime that we were working in, and those aboard were continually bracing\nthe yards about for every puff that struck us, until about 12 o’clock,\nwhen we came-to in 40 fathoms water, and our anchor struck bottom\nfor the first time since we left Boston–one hundred and three days.\nWe were then divided into three watches, and thus stood out the remainder\nof the night.",
        "I was called on deck to stand my watch at about three in the morning,\nand I shall never forget the peculiar sensation which I experienced\non finding myself once more surrounded by land, feeling the night\nbreeze coming from off shore, and hearing the frogs and crickets.\nThe mountains seemed almost to hang over us, and apparently from the\nvery heart there came out, at regular intervals, a loud echoing sound,\nwhich affected me as hardly human.  We saw no lights, and could hardly\naccount for the sound, until the mate, who had been there before, told\nus that it was the “Alerta” of the Spanish soldiers, who were stationed\nover some convicts confined in caves nearly halfway up the mountain.\nAt the expiration of my watch I went below, feeling not a little anxious\nfor the day, that I might see more nearly, and perhaps tread upon,\nthis romantic, I may almost say, classic island.",
        "When all hands were called it was nearly sunrise, and between that time\nand breakfast, although quite busy on board in getting up water-casks,\netc., I had a good view of the objects about me.  The harbor was nearly\nland-locked, and at the head of it was a landing-place, protected by a\nsmall breakwater of stones, upon which two large boats were hauled up,\nwith a sentry standing over them.  Near this was a variety of huts or\ncottages, nearly an hundred in number, the best of them built of mud\nand white washed, but the greater part only Robinson Crusoe like–\nof posts and branches of trees.  The governor’s house, as it is called,\nwas the most conspicuous, being large, with grated windows, plastered\nwalls, and roof of red tiles; yet, like all the rest, only of one story.\nNear it was a small chapel, distinguished by a cross; and a long, low\nbrown-looking building, surrounded by something like a palisade, from\nwhich an old and dingy-looking Chilian flag was flying.  This, of course,\nwas dignified by the title of Presidio.  A sentinel was stationed at\nthe chapel, another at the governor’s house, and a few soldiers armed\nwith bayonets, looking rather ragged, with shoes out at the toes, were\nstrolling about among the houses, or waiting at the landing-place for\nour boat to come ashore.",
        "The mountains were high, but not so overhanging as they appeared\nto be by starlight.  They seemed to bear off towards the centre of\nthe island, and were green and well wooded, with some large, and,\nI am told, exceedingly fertile valleys, with mule-tracks leading\nto different parts of the island.",
        "I cannot forget how my friend S––- and myself got the laugh of\nthe crew upon us for our eagerness to get on shore.  The captain\nhaving ordered the quarter-boat to be lowered, we both sprang down\ninto the forecastle, filled our jacket pockets with tobacco to barter\nwith the people ashore, and when the officer called for “four hands\nin the boat,” nearly broke our necks in our haste to be first over\nthe side, and had the pleasure of pulling ahead of the brig with a\ntow-line for a half an hour, and coming on board again to be laughed\nat by the crew, who had seen our manoeuvre.",
        "After breakfast the second mate was ordered ashore with five hands\nto fill the water-casks, and to my joy I was among the number.\nWe pulled ashore with the empty casks; and here again fortune\nfavored me, for the water was too thick and muddy to be put into\nthe casks, and the governor had sent men up to the head of the\nstream to clear it out for us, which gave us nearly two hours of\nleisure.  This leisure we employed in wandering about among the\nhouses, and eating a little fruit which was offered to us.\nGround apples, melons, grapes, strawberries of an enormous size,\nand cherries, abounded here.  The latter are said to have been\nplanted by Lord Anson.  The soldiers were miserably clad, and\nasked with some interest whether we had any shoes to sell on board.\nI doubt very much if they had the means of buying them.  They were\nvery eager to get tobacco, for which they gave shells, fruits, etc.\nKnives also were in demand, but we were forbidden by the governor\nto let any one have them, as he told us that all the people there,\nexcept the soldiers and a few officers, were convicts sent from\nValparaiso, and that it was necessary to keep all weapons from\ntheir hands.  The island, it seems, belongs to Chili, and had been\nused by the government as a sort of Botany Bay for nearly two years;\nand the governor–an Englishman who had entered the Chilian navy–\nwith a priest, half a dozen task-masters, and a body of soldiers,\nwere stationed there to keep them in order.  This was no easy task;\nand only a few months before our arrival, a few of them had stolen a\nboat at night, boarded a brig lying in the harbor, sent the captain\nand crew ashore in their boat, and gone off to sea.  We were informed\nof this, and loaded our arms and kept strict watch on board through\nthe night, and were careful not to let the convicts get our knives\nfrom us when on shore.  The worst part of the convicts, I found, were\nlocked up under sentry in caves dug into the side of the mountain,\nnearly halfway up, with mule-tracks leading to them, whence they\nwere taken by day and set to work under task-masters upon building\nan aqueduct, a wharf, and other public works; while the rest lived\nin the houses which they put up for themselves, had their families\nwith them, and seemed to me to be the laziest people on the face\nof the earth.  They did nothing but take a paseo into the woods,\na  paseo among the houses, a paseo at the landing-place, looking at\nus and our vessel, and too lazy to speak fast; while the others were\ndriving–or rather, driven–about, at a rapid trot, in single file,\nwith burdens on their shoulders, and followed up by their task-masters,\nwith long rods in their hands, and broadbrimmed straw hats upon their\nheads.  Upon what precise grounds this great distinction was made,\nI do not know, and I could not very well know, for the governor was the\nonly man who spoke English upon the island, and he was out of my walk.",
        "Having filled our casks, we returned on board, and soon after,\nthe governor, dressed in a uniform like that of an American militia\nofficer, the Padre, in the dress of the grey friars, with hood\nand all complete, and the Capitan, with big whiskers and dirty\nregimentals, came on board to dine.  While at dinner, a large\nship appeared in the offing, and soon afterwards we saw a light\nwhale-boat pulling into the harbor.  The ship lay off and on,\nand a boat came alongside of us, and put on board the captain,\na plain young Quaker, dressed all in brown.  The ship was the\nCortes, whaleman, of New Bedford, and had put in to see if there\nwere any vessels from round the Horn, and to hear the latest news\nfrom America.  They remained aboard a short time and had a little\ntalk with the crew, when they left us and pulled off to their ship,\nwhich, having filled away, was soon out of sight.",
        "A small boat which came from the shore to take away the governor\nand suite–as they styled themselves–brought, as a present to the\ncrew, a large pail of milk, a few shells, and a block of sandal wood.\nThe milk, which was the first we had tasted since leaving Boston,\nwe soon despatched; a piece of the sandal wood I obtained, and\nlearned that it grew on the hills in the centre of the island.\nI have always regretted that I did not bring away other specimens\nof the products of the island, having afterwards lost all that I\nhad with me–the piece of sandal wood, and a small flower which I\nplucked and brought on board in the crown of my tarpaulin,\nand carefully pressed between the leaves of a book.",
        "About an hour before sun-down, having stowed our water casks, we\ncommenced getting under weigh, and were not a little while about it;\nfor we were in thirty fathoms water, and in one of the gusts which\ncame off shore had let go our other bow anchor; and as the southerly\nwind draws round the mountains and comes off in uncertain flaws,\nwe were continually swinging round, and had thus got a very foul hawse.\nWe hove in upon our chain, and after stoppering and unshackling it\nagain and again, and hoisting and hauling down sail, we at length\ntipped our anchor and stood out to sea.  It was bright starlight\nwhen we were clear of the bay, and the lofty island lay behind us,\nin its still beauty, and I gave a parting look, and bid farewell,\nto the most romantic spot of earth that my eyes had ever seen.\nI did then, and have ever since, felt an attachment for that island,\naltogether peculiar.  It was partly, no doubt, from its having been\nthe first land that I had seen since leaving home, and still more\nfrom the associations which every one has connected with it in their\nchildhood from reading Robinson Crusoe.  To this I may add the height\nand romantic outline of its mountains, the beauty and freshness of\nits verdure, and the extreme fertility of its soil, and its solitary\nposition in the midst of the wide expanse of the South Pacific,\nas all concurring to give it its peculiar charm.",
        "When thoughts of this place have occurred to me at different times,\nI have endeavored to recall more particulars with regard to it.\nIt is situated in about 33º 30’ S., and is distant a little more than\nthree hundred miles from Valparaiso, on the coast of Chili, which is\nin the same latitude.  It is about fifteen miles in length and five\nin breadth.  The harbor in which we anchored (called by Lord Anson,\nCumberland bay) is the only one in the island; two small bights of\nland on each side of the main bay (sometimes dignified by the name\nof bays) being little more than landing-places for boats.  The best\nanchorage is at the western side of the bay, where we lay at about\nthree cables’ lengths from the shore, in a little more than thirty\nfathoms water.  This harbor is open to the N.N.E., and in fact nearly\nfrom N. to E., but the only dangerous winds being the south-west,\non which side are the highest mountains, it is considered very safe.\nThe most remarkable thing perhaps about it is the fish with which it\nabounds.  Two of our crew, who remained on board, caught in a few\nminutes enough to last us for several days, and one of the men,\nwho was a Marblehead man, said that he never saw or heard of such\nan abundance.  There were cod, breams, silver-fish, and other kinds\nwhose names they did not know, or which I have forgotten.",
        "There is an abundance of the best of water upon the island, small\nstreams running through every valley, and leaping down from the\nsides of the hills.  One stream of considerable size flows through\nthe centre of the lawn upon which the houses are built, and furnishes\nan easy and abundant supply to the inhabitants.  This, by means\nof a short wooden aqueduct, was brought quite down to our boats.\nThe convicts had also built something in the way of a breakwater,\nand were to build a landing-place for boats and goods, after which\nthe Chilian government intended to lay port charges.",
        "Of the wood I can only say, that it appeared to be abundant; the\nisland in the month of November, when we were there, being in all\nthe freshness and beauty of spring, appeared covered with trees.\nThese were chiefly aromatic, and the largest was the myrtle.\nThe soil is very loose and rich, and wherever it is broken up,\nthere spring up immediately radishes, turnips, ground apples,\nand other garden fruits.  Goats, we were told, were not abundant,\nand we saw none, though it was said we might, if we had gone into\nthe interior.  We saw a few bullocks winding about in the narrow\ntracks upon the sides of the mountains, and the settlement was\ncompletely overrun with dogs of every nation, kindred, and degree.\nHens and chickens were also abundant, and seemed to be taken good\ncare of by the women.  The men appeared to be the laziest people\nupon the face of the earth; and indeed, as far as my observation goes,\nthere are no people to whom the newly-invented Yankee word of “loafer\"\nis more applicable than to the Spanish Americans.  These men stood\nabout doing nothing, with their cloaks, little better in texture\nthan an Indian’s blanket, but of rich colors, thrown over their\nshoulders with an air which it is said that a Spanish beggar can\nalways give to his rags; and with great politeness and courtesy\nin their address, though with holes in their shoes and without\na sou in their pockets.  The only interruption to the monotony\nof their day seemed to be when a gust of wind drew round between\nthe mountains and blew off the boughs which they had placed for\nroofs to their houses, and gave them a few minutes’ occupation\nin running about after them.  One of these gusts occurred while\nwe were ashore, and afforded us no little amusement at seeing the\nmen look round, and if they found that their roofs had stood,\nconclude that they might stand too, while those who saw theirs\nblown off, after uttering a few Spanish oaths, gathered their\ncloaks over their shoulders, and started off after them.  However,\nthey were not gone long, but soon returned to their habitual\noccupation of doing nothing.",
        "It is perhaps needless to say that we saw nothing of the interior;\nbut all who have seen it, give very glowing accounts of it.\nOur captain went with the governor and a few servants upon mules\nover the mountains, and upon their return, I heard the governor\nrequest him to stop at the island on his passage home, and offer\nhim a handsome sum to bring a few deer with him from California,\nfor he said that there were none upon the island, and he was very\ndesirous of having it stocked.",
        "A steady, though light south-westerly wind carried us well off from\nthe island, and when I came on deck for the middle watch I could just\ndistinguish it from its hiding a few low stars in the southern horizon,\nthough my unpracticed eyes would hardly have known it for land.\nAt the close of the watch a few trade-wind clouds which had arisen,\nthough we were hardly yet in their latitude, shut it out from our view,\nand the next day,",
        "Thursday, Nov. 27th, upon coming on deck in the morning, we were\nagain upon the wide Pacific, and saw no more land until we arrived\nupon the western coast of the great continent of America.",
        "As we saw neither land nor sail from the time of leaving Juan Fernandez\nuntil our arrival in California, nothing of interest occurred except\nour own doing on board.  We caught the south-east trades, and run\nbefore them for nearly three weeks, without so much as altering a\nsail or bracing a yard.  The captain took advantage of this fine\nweather to get the vessel in order for coming upon the coast.\nThe carpenter was employed in fitting up a part of the steerage\ninto a trade-room; for our cargo, we now learned, was not to be\nlanded, but to be sold by retail from on board; and this trade-room\nwas built for the samples and the lighter goods to be kept in,\nand as a place for the general business.  In the mean time we were\nemployed in working upon the rigging.  Everything was set up taught,\nthe lower rigging rattled down, or rather rattled up, (according\nto the modern fashion,) an abundance of spun-yarn and seizing-stuff\nmade, and finally, the whole standing-rigging, fore and aft, was\ntarred down.  This was my first essay at this latter business,\nand I had enough of it; for nearly all of it came upon my friend\nS––- and myself.  The men were needed at the other work, and\nM––-, the other young man who came out with us, was laid up with\nthe rheumatism in his feet, and the boy was rather too young and\nsmall for the business; and as the winds were light and regular,\nhe was kept during most of the daytime at the helm; so that nearly\nall the tarring came upon us.  We put on short duck frocks, and\ntaking a small bucket of tar and a bunch of oakum in our hands we\nwent aloft, one at the main royal-mast-head and the other at the fore,\nand began tarring down.  This is an important operation, and is usually\ndone about once in six months in vessels upon a long voyage.  It was\ndone in our vessel several times afterwards, but by the whole crew\nat once, and finished off in a day; but at this time, as most of it\ncame upon two of us, and we were new at the business, it took us\nseveral days.  In this operation they always begin at the mast-head\nand work down, tarring the shrouds, back-stays, standing parts of\nthe lifts, the ties, runners, etc., and go out to the yard-arms,\nand come in, tarring, as they come, the lifts and foot-ropes.\nTarring the stays is more difficult, and is done by an operation\nwhich the sailors call “riding down.”  A long piece of rope–\ntop-gallant-studding-sail halyards, or something of the kind–\nis taken up to the mast-head from which the stay leads, and rove\nthrough a block for a girt-line, or, as the sailors usually call it,\na gant-line; with the end of this a bowline is taken round the stay,\ninto which the man gets with his bucket of tar and a bunch of oakum,\nand the other end being fast on deck, with some one to tend it, he\nis lowered down gradually, and tars the stay carefully as he goes.\nThere he “sings aloft ’twixt heaven and earth,” and if the rope slips,\nbreaks, or is let go, or if the bowline slips, he falls overboard or\nbreaks his neck.  This, however, is a thing which never enters into\na sailor’s calculation.  He thinks only of leaving no holydays,\n(places not tarred,) for in case he should, he would have to go\nover the whole again; or of dropping no tar upon deck, for then\nthere would be a soft word in his ear from the mate.  In this manner\nI tarred down all the head-stays, but found the rigging about the\njib-booms, martingale, and spritsail yard, upon which I was afterwards\nput, the hardest.  Here you have to hang on with your eye-lids and tar\nwith your hands.",
        "This dirty work could not last forever, and on Saturday night we\nfinished it, scraped all the spots from the deck and rails, and,\nwhat was of more importance to us, cleaned ourselves thoroughly,\nrolled up our tarry frocks and trowsers and laid them away for the\nnext occasion, and put on our clean duck clothes, and had a good\ncomfortable sailor’s Saturday night.  The next day was pleasant,\nand indeed we had but one unpleasant Sunday during the whole voyage,\nand that was off Cape Horn, where we could expect nothing better.\nOn Monday we commenced painting, and getting the vessel ready for\nport.  This work, too, is done by the crew, and every sailor who\nhas been long voyages is a little of a painter, in addition to his\nother accomplishments.  We painted her, both inside and out, from\nthe truck to the water’s edge.  The outside is painted by lowering\nstages over the side by ropes, and on those we sat, with our brushes\nand paint-pots by us, and our feet half the time in the water.  This\nmust be done, of course, on a smooth day, when the vessel does not\nroll much.  I remember very well being over the side painting in this\nway, one fine afternoon, our vessel going quietly along at the rate\nof four or five knots, and a pilot-fish, the sure precursor of the\nshark, swimming alongside of us.  The captain was leaning over the\nrail watching him, and we quietly went on with our work.  In the\nmidst of our painting, on",
        "Friday, Dec. 19th, we crossed the equator for the second time.\nI had the feeling which all have when, for the first time, they find\nthemselves living under an entire change of seasons; as, crossing the\nline under a burning sun in the midst of December, and, as I afterwards\nwas, beating about among ice and snow on the fourth of July.",
        "Thursday, Dec. 25th.  This day was Christmas, but it brought us no\nholiday.  The only change was that we had a “plum duff” for dinner,\nand the crew quarrelled with the steward because he did not give us\nour usual allowance of molasses to eat with it.  He thought the plums\nwould be a substitute for the molasses, but we were not to be cheated\nout of our rights in this way.",
        "Such are the trifles which produce quarrels on shipboard.  In fact,\nwe had been too long from port.  We were getting tired of one another,\nand were in an irritable state, both forward and aft.  Our fresh\nprovisions were, of course, gone, and the captain had stopped our rice,\nso that we had nothing but salt beef and salt pork throughout the week,\nwith the exception of a very small duff on Sunday.  This added to the\ndiscontent; and a thousand little things, daily and almost hourly\noccurring, which no one who has not himself been on a long and tedious\nvoyage can conceive of or properly appreciate,–little wars and rumors\nof wars,–reports of things said in the cabin,–misunderstanding of\nwords and looks,–apparent abuses,–brought us into a state in which\neverything seemed to go wrong.  Every encroachment upon the time\nallowed for rest, appeared unnecessary.  Every shifting of the\nstudding-sails was only to “haze\"(1) the crew.",
        "–––––––––––––––\n1. Haze is a word of frequent use on board ship, and never,\n   I believe, used elsewhere.  It is very expressive to a sailor,\n   and means to punish by hard work.  Let an officer once say,\n   “I’ll haze you,” and your fate is fixed.  You will be\n   “worked up,” if you are not a better man than he is.\n–––––––––––––––",
        "In this midst of this state of things, my messmate S––- and myself\npetitioned the captain for leave to shift our berths from the steerage,\nwhere we had previously lived, into the forecastle.  This, to our delight,\nwas granted, and we turned in to bunk and mess with the crew forward.\nWe now began to feel like sailors, which we never fully did when we were\nin the steerage.  While there, however useful and active you may be,\nyou are but a mongrel,–and sort of afterguard and “ship’s cousin.\"\nYou are immediately under the eye of the officers, cannot dance, sing,\nplay, smoke, make a noise, or growl, (i.e. complain,) or take any\nother sailor’s pleasure; and you live with the steward, who is usually\na go-between; and the crew never feel as though you were one of them.\nBut if you live in the forecastle, you are “as independent as a\nwood-sawyer’s clerk,” (nautice’,) and are a sailor.  You hear sailor’s\ntalk, learn their ways, their peculiarities of feeling as well as\nspeaking and acting; and moreover pick up a great deal of curious\nand useful information in seamanship, ship’s customs, foreign countries,\netc., from their long yarns and equally long disputes.  No man can be\na sailor, or know what sailors are, unless he has lived in the forecastle\nwith them–turned in and out with them, eaten of their dish and drank\nof their cup.  After I had been a week there, nothing would have tempted\nme to go back to my old berth, and never afterwards, even in the worst\nof weather, when in a close and leaking forecastle off Cape Horn,\ndid I for a moment wish myself in the steerage.  Another thing which\nyou learn better in the forecastle than you can anywhere else, is,\nto make and mend clothes, and this is indispensable to sailors.\nA large part of their watches below they spend at this work, and here\nI learned that art which stood me in so good stead afterwards.",
        "But to return to the state of the crew.  Upon our coming into the\nforecastle, there was some difficulty about the uniting of the\nallowances of bread, by which we thought we were to lose a few pounds.\nThis set us into a ferment.  The captain would not condescend to explain,\nand we went aft in a body, with a Swede, the oldest and best sailor of\nthe crew, for spokesman.  The recollection of the scene that followed\nalways brings up a smile, especially the quarter-deck dignity and\neloquence of the captain.  He was walking the weather side of the\nquarter-deck, and seeing us coming aft, stopped short in his walk,\nand, with a voice and look intended to annihilate us, called out,\n\"Well, what do you want now?”  Whereupon we stated our grievances\nas respectfully as we could, but he broke in upon us, saying that\nwe were getting fat and lazy, didn’t have enough to do, and that made\nus find fault.  This provoked us, and we began to give word for word.\nThis would never answer.  He clenched his fist, stamped and swore,\nand sent us all forward, saying, with oaths enough interspersed to\nsend the words home,–\"Away with you! go forward every one of you!\nI’ll haze you!  I’ll work you up!  You don’t have enough to do!\nYou’ve mistaken your man.  I’m F––- T––-, all the way from\n’down east.’  I’ve been through the mill, ground, and bolted, and come\nout a regular-built down-east johnny-cake, good when it’s hot, but when\nit’s cold, sour and indigestible;–and you’ll find me so!”  The latter\npart of the harangue I remember well, for it made a strong impression,\nand the “down-east johnny-cake” became a by-word for the rest of the\nvoyage.  So much for our petition for the redress of grievances.\nThe matter was however set right, for the mate, after allowing the\ncaptain due time to cool off, explained it to him, and at night we\nwere all called aft to hear another harangue, in which, of course,\nthe whole blame of the misunderstanding was thrown upon us.  We ventured\nto hint that he would not give us time to explain; but it wouldn’t do.\nWe were driven back discomforted.  Thus the affair blew over, but the\nirritation caused by it remained; and we never had peace or a good\nunderstanding again so long as the captain and crew remained together.",
        "We continued sailing along in the beautiful temperate climate of\nthe Pacific.  The Pacific well deserves its name, for except in the\nsouthern part, at Cape Horn, and in the western parts, near the\nChina and Indian oceans, it has few storms, and is never either\nextremely hot or cold.  Between the tropics there is a slight haziness,\nlike a thin gauze, drawn over the sun, which, without obstructing or\nobscuring the light, tempers the heat which comes down with perpendicular\nfierceness in the Atlantic and Indian tropics.  We sailed well to the\nwestward to have the full advantage of the north-east trades, and when\nwe had reached the latitude of Point Conception, where it is usual to\nmake the land, we were several hundred miles to the westward of it.\nWe immediately changed our course due east, and sailed in that direction\nfor a number of days.  At length we began to heave-to after dark, for fear\nof making the land at night on a coast where there are no light-houses and\nbut indifferent charts, and at daybreak on the morning of",
        "Tuesday, Jan 13th, 1835, we made the land at Point Conception,\nlat 34º 32’ N., long 120º 06’ W.  The port of Santa Barbara, to which\nwe were bound, lying about sixty miles to the southward of this point,\nwe continued sailing down the coast during the day and following night,\nand on the next morning,",
        "Jan. 14th, 1835, we came to anchor in the spacious bay of Santa Barbara,\nafter a voyage of one hundred and fifty days from Boston.",
        "California extends along nearly the whole of the western coast of\nMexico, between the gulf of California in the south and the bay of\nSir Francis Drake on the north, or between the 22d and 38th degrees\nof north latitude.  It is subdivided into two provinces–Lower or\nOld California, lying between the gulf and the 32d degree of latitude,\nor near it; (the division line running, I believe, between the bay of\nTodos Santos and the port of San Diego;) and New or Upper California,\nthe southernmost port of which is San Diego, in lat. 32º 39’, and the\nnorthernmost, San Francisco, situated in the large bay discovered by\nSir Francis Drake, in lat. 37º 58’, and called after him by the English,\nthough the Mexicans call it Yerba Buena.  Upper California has the seat\nof its government at Monterey, where is also the custom-house, the only\none on the coast, and at which every vessel intending to trade on the\ncoast must enter its cargo before it can commence its traffic.  We were\nto trade upon this coast exclusively, and therefore expected to go to\nMonterey at first; but the captain’s orders from home were to put in\nat Santa Barbara, which is the central port of the coast, and wait\nthere for the agent who lives there, and transacts all the business\nfor the firm to which our vessel belonged.",
        "The bay, or, as it was commonly called, the canal of Santa Barbara,\nis very large, being formed by the main land on one side, (between\nPoint Conception on the north and Point St. Buena Ventura on the south,)\nwhich here bends in like a crescent, and three large islands opposite\nto it and at the distance of twenty miles.  This is just sufficient to\ngive it the name of a bay, while at the same time it is so large and\nso much exposed to the south-east and north-west winds, that it is\nlittle better than an open roadstead; and the whole swell of the\nPacific ocean rolls in here before a southeaster, and breaks with\nso heavy a surf in the shallow waters, that it is highly dangerous\nto lie near to the shore during the south-easter season; that is,\nbetween the months of November and April.",
        "This wind (the south-easter) is the bane of the coast of California.\nBetween the months of November and April, (including a part of each,)\nwhich is the rainy season in this latitude, you are never safe from it,\nand accordingly, in the ports which are open to it, vessels are obliged,\nduring these months, to lie at anchor at a distance of three miles from\nthe shore, with slip-ropes on their cables, ready to slip and go to sea\nat a moment’s warning.  The only ports which are safe from this wind\nare San Francisco and Monterey in the north, and San Diego in the south.",
        "As it was January when we arrived, and the middle of the south-easter\nseason, we accordingly came to anchor at the distance of three miles\nfrom the shore, in eleven fathoms water, and bent a slip-rope and\nbuoys to our cables, cast off the yard-arm gaskets from the sails,\nand stopped them all with rope-yarns.  After we had done this,\nthe boat went ashore with the captain, and returned with orders to\nthe mate to send a boat ashore for him at sundown.  I did not go in\nthe first boat, and was glad to find that there was another going\nbefore night; for after so long a voyage as ours had been, a few hours\nis long to pass in sight and out of reach of land.  We spent the day\non board in the usual avocations; but as this was the first time we\nhad been without the captain, we felt a little more freedom, and looked\nabout us to see what sort of a country we had got into, and were to\nspend a year or two of our lives in.",
        "In the first place, it was a beautiful day, and so warm that we had\non straw hats, duck trowsers, and all the summer gear; and as this\nwas mid-winter, it spoke well for the climate; and we afterwards\nfound that the thermometer never fell to the freezing-point throughout\nthe winter, and that there was very little difference between the\nseasons, except that during a long period of rainy and south-easterly\nweather, thick clothes were not uncomfortable.",
        "The large bay lay about us, nearly smooth, as there was hardly a\nbreath of wind stirring, though the boat’s crew who went ashore told\nus that the long ground swell broke into a heavy surf upon the beach.\nThere was only one vessel in the port–a long, sharp brig of about\n300 tons, with raking masts and very square yards, and English colors\nat her peak.  We afterwards learned that she was built at Guayaquil,\nand named the Ayacucho, after the place where the battle was fought\nthat gave Peru her independence, and was now owned by a Scotchman\nnamed Wilson, who commanded her, and was engaged in the trade between\nCallao, the Sandwich Islands, and California.  She was a fast sailer,\nas we frequently afterwards perceived, and had a crew of Sandwich\nIslanders on board.  Beside this vessel there was no object to break\nthe surface of the bay.  Two points ran out as the horns of the crescent,\none of which–the one to the westward–was low and sandy, and is that\nto which vessels are obliged to give a wide berth when running out\nfor a south-easter; the other is high, bold, and well wooded, and,\nwe were told, has a mission upon it, called St. Buenaventura, from which\nthe point is named.  In the middle of this crescent, directly opposite\nthe anchoring ground, lie the mission and town of Santa Barbara, on a\nlow, flat plain, but little above the level of the sea, covered with\ngrass, though entirely without trees, and surrounded on three sides\nby an amphitheatre of mountains, which slant off to the distance of\nfifteen or twenty miles.  The mission stands a little back of the town,\nand is a large building, or rather a collection of buildings, in the\ncentre of which is a high tower, with a belfry of five bells; and the\nwhole, being plastered, makes quite a show at a distance, and is the\nmark by which vessels come to anchor.  The town lies a little nearer\nto the beach–about half a mile from it–and is composed of one-story\nhouses built of brown clay–some of them plastered–with red tiles on\nthe roofs.  I should judge that there were about an hundred of them;\nand in the midst of them stands the Presidio, or fort, built of the\nsame materials, and apparently but little stronger.  The town is\ncertainly finely situated, with a bay in front, and an amphitheatre\nof hills behind.  The only thing which diminishes its beauty is,\nthat the hills have no large trees upon them, they having been all\nburnt by a great fire which swept them off about a dozen years before,\nand they had not yet grown up again.  The fire was described to me by\nan inhabitant, as having been a very terrible and magnificent sight.\nThe air of the whole valley was so heated that the people were obliged\nto leave the town and take up their quarters for several days upon the beach.",
        "Just before sun-down the mate ordered a boat’s crew ashore, and I\nwent as one of the number.  We passed under the stern of the English\nbrig, and had a long pull ashore.  I shall never forget the impression\nwhich our first landing on the beach of California made upon me.\nThe sun had just gone down; it was getting dusky; the damp night wind\nwas beginning to blow, and the heavy swell of the Pacific was setting in,\nand breaking in loud and high “combers” upon the beach.  We lay on our\noars in the swell, just outside of the surf, waiting for a good chance\nto run in, when a boat, which had put off from the Ayacucho just after\nus, came alongside of us, with a crew of dusky Sandwich Islanders,\ntalking and halooing in their outlandish tongue.  They knew that we\nwere novices in this kind of boating, and waited to see us go in.\nThe second mate, however, who steered our boat, determined to have\nthe advantage of their experience, and would not go in first.\nFinding, at length, how matters stood, they gave a shout, and taking\nadvantage of a great comber which came swelling in, rearing its head,\nand lifting up the stern of our boat nearly perpendicular, and again\ndropping it in the trough, they gave three or four long and strong pulls,\nand went in on top of the great wave, throwing their oars overboard,\nand as far from the boat as they could throw them, and jumping out the\ninstant that the boat touched the beach, and then seizing hold of her\nand running her up high and dry upon the sand.  We saw, at once,\nhow it was to be done, and also the necessity of keeping the boat\n\"stern on” to the sea; for the instant the sea should strike upon\nher broad-side or quarter, she would be driven up broad-side-on,\nand capsized.  We pulled strongly in, and as soon as we felt that\nthe sea had got hold of us and was carrying us in with the speed\nof a race-horse, we threw the oars as far from the boat as we could,\nand took hold of the gunwale, ready to spring out and seize her when\nshe struck, the officer using his utmost strength to keep her stern on.\nWe were shot up upon the beach like an arrow from a bow, and seizing\nthe boat, ran her up high and dry, and soon picked up our oars,\nand stood by her, ready for the captain to come down.",
        "Finding that the captain did not come immediately, we put our oars\nin the boat, and leaving one to watch it, walked about the beach to\nsee what we could, of the place.  The beach is nearly a mile in\nlength between the two points, and of smooth sand.  We had taken\nthe only good landing-place, which is in the middle; it being\nmore stony toward the ends.  It is about twenty yards in width\nfrom high-water mark to a slight bank at which the soil begins,\nand so hard that it is a favorite place for running horses.\nIt was growing dark, so that we could just distinguish the dim\noutlines of the two vessels in the offing; and the great seas\nwere rolling in, in regular lines, growing larger and larger as\nthey approached the shore, and hanging over the beach upon which\nthey were to break, when their tops would curl over and turn white\nwith foam, and, beginning at one extreme of the line, break rapidly\nto the other, as a long card-house falls when the children knock\ndown the cards at one end.  The Sandwich Islanders, in the mean time,\nhad turned their boat round, and ran her down into the water, and were\nloading her with hides and tallow.  As this was the work in which we\nwere soon to be engaged, we looked on with some curiosity.  They ran\nthe boat into the water so far that every large sea might float her,\nand two of them, with their trowsers rolled up, stood by the bows,\none on each side, keeping her in her right position.  This was hard\nwork; for beside the force they had to use upon the boat, the large\nseas nearly took them off their legs.  The others were running from\nthe boat to the bank, upon which, out of the reach of the water,\nwas a pile of dry bullocks’ hides, doubled lengthwise in the middle,\nand nearly as stiff as boards.  These they took upon their heads,\none or two at a time, and carried down to the boat, where one of\ntheir number stowed them away.  They were obliged to carry them\non their heads, to keep them out of the water, and we observed\nthat they had on thick woolen caps.  “Look here, Bill, and see\nwhat you’re coming to!” said one of our men to another who stood\nby the boat.  “Well, D––-,” said the second mate to me, “this does\nnot look much like Cambridge college, does it?  This is what I call\n’head work.’”  To tell the truth, it did not look very encouraging.",
        "After they had got through with the hides, they laid hold of the\nbags of tallow, (the bags are made of hide, and are about the size\nof a common meal bag,) and lifting each upon the shoulders of two\nmen, one at each end, walked off with them to the boat, and prepared\nto go aboard.  Here, too, was something for us to learn.  The man\nwho steered, shipped his oar and stood up in the stern, and those\nthat pulled the after oars sat upon their benches, with their oars\nshipped, ready to strike out as soon as she was afloat.  The two\nmen at the bows kept their places; and when, at length, a large\nsea came in and floated her, seized hold of the gunwale, and ran\nout with her till they were up to their armpits, and then tumbled\nover the gunwale into the bows, dripping with water.  The men at\nthe oars struck out, but it wouldn’t do; the sea swept back and\nleft them nearly high and dry.  The two fellows jumped out again;\nand the next time they succeeded better, and, with the help of\na deal of outlandish hallooing and bawling, got her well off.\nWe watched them till they were out of the breakers, and saw them\nsteering for their vessel, which was now hidden in the darkness.",
        "The sand of the beach began to be cold to our bare feet; the frogs\nset up their croaking in the marshes, and one solitary owl, from the\nend of the distant point, gave out his melancholy note, mellowed by\nthe distance, and we began to think that it was high time for\n\"the old man,” as the captain is generally called, to come down.\nIn a few minutes we heard something coming towards us.  It was a\nman on horseback.  He came up on the full gallop, reined up near us,\naddressed a few words to us, and receiving no answer, wheeled around\nand galloped off again.  He was nearly as dark as an Indian, with a\nlarge Spanish hat, blanket cloak or surreppa, and leather leggins,\nwith a long knife stuck in them.  “This is the seventh city that\never I was in, and no Christian one neither,” said Bill Brown.\n\"Stand by!” said Tom, “you haven’t seen the worst of it yet.\"\nIn the midst of this conversation the captain appeared; and we\nwinded the boat round, shoved her down, and prepared to go off.\nThe captain, who had been on the coast before and “knew the ropes,\"\ntook the steering oar, and we went off in the same way as the other\nboat. I, being the youngest, had the pleasure of standing at the bow,\nand getting wet through.  We went off well, though the seas were high.\nSome of them lifted us up, and sliding from under us, seemed to let\nus drop through the air like a flat plank upon the body of the water.\nIn a few minutes we were in the low, regular swell, and pulled for a\nlight, which, as we came up, we found had been run up to our trysail gaff.",
        "Coming aboard, we hoisted up all the boats, and diving down into\nthe forecastle, changed our wet clothes, and got our supper.\nAfter supper the sailors lighted their pipes, (cigars, those\nof us who had them,) and we had to tell all we had seen ashore.\nThen followed conjectures about the people ashore, the length of\nthe voyage, carrying hides, etc., until eight bells, when all hands\nwere called aft, and the “anchor watch” set.  We were to stand two\nin a watch, and as the nights were pretty long, two hours were to\nmake a watch.  The second mate was to keep the deck until eight\no’clock, and all hands were to be called at daybreak, and the word\nwas passed to keep a bright look-out, and to call the mate if it\nshould come on to blow from the south-east.  We had also orders\nto strike the bells every half-hour through the night, as at sea.\nMy watchmate was John, the Swedish sailor, and we stood from\ntwelve to two, he walking the larboard side, and I the starboard.\nAt daylight all hands were called, and we went through the usual\nprocess of washing down, swabbing, etc., and got breakfast at\neight o’clock.  In the course of the forenoon, a boat went aboard\nof the Ayacucho and brought off a quarter of beef, which made us\na fresh bite for dinner.  This we were glad enough to have, and the\nmate told us that we should live upon fresh beef while we were on\nthe coast, as it was cheaper here than the salt.  While at dinner,\nthe cook called, “Sail ho!” and coming on deck, we saw two sails\ncoming round the point.  One was a large ship under top-gallant\nsails, and the other a small hermaphrodite brig.  They both backed\ntheir topsails and sent boats aboard of us.  The ship’s colors had\npuzzled us, and we found that she was from Genoa, with an assorted\ncargo, and was trading on the coast.  She filled away again, and stood\nout; being bound up the coast to San Francisco.  The crew of the\nbrig’s boat were Sandwich Islanders, but one of them, who spoke a\nlittle English, told us that she was the Loriotte, Captain Nye,\nfrom Oahu, and was engaged in this trade.  She was a lump of a thing\n–what the sailors call a butter-box.  This vessel, as well as the\nAyacucho, and others which we afterwards saw engaged in the same trade,\nhave English or Americans for officers, and two or three before the\nmast to do the work upon the rigging, and to rely upon for seamanship,\nwhile the rest of the crew are Sandwich Islanders, who are active,\nand very useful in boating.",
        "The three captains went ashore after dinner, and came off again at\nnight.  When in port, everything is attended to by the chief mate;\nthe captain, unless he is also supercargo, has little to do, and is\nusually ashore much of his time.  This we thought would be pleasanter\nfor us, as the mate was a good-natured man and not very strict.\nSo it was for a time, but we were worse off in the end; for wherever\nthe captain is a severe, energetic man, and the mate is wanting in\nboth these qualities, there will always be trouble.  And trouble we\nhad already begun to anticipate.  The captain had several times found\nfault with the mate, in presence of the crew; and hints had been\ndropped that all was not right between them.  When this is the case,\nand the captain suspects that his officer is too easy and familiar\nwith the crew, then he begins to interfere in all the duties, and to\ndraw the reins taughter, and the crew have to suffer.",
        "This night, after sundown, it looked black at the southward and\neastward, and we were told to keep a bright look-out.  Expecting\nto be called up, we turned in early.  Waking up about midnight,\nI found a man who had just come down from his watch, striking a light.\nHe said that it was beginning to puff up from the south-east, and that\nthe sea was rolling in, and he had called the captain; and as he threw\nhimself down on his chest with all his clothes on, I knew that he\nexpected to be called.  I felt the vessel pitching at her anchor,\nand the chain surging and snapping, and lay awake, expecting an\ninstant summons.  In a few minutes it came–three knocks on the\nscuttle, and “All hands ahoy! bear-a-hand up and make sail.\"\nWe sprang up for our clothes, and were about halfway dressed,\nwhen the mate called out, down the scuttle, “Tumble up here, men!\ntumble up! before she drags her anchor.”  We were on deck in an instant.\n\"Lay aloft and loose the topsails!” shouted the captain, as soon as\nthe first man showed himself.  Springing into the rigging, I saw that\nthe Ayacucho’s topsails were loosed, and heard her crew singing-out\nat the sheets as they were hauling them home.  This had probably\nstarted our captain; as “old Wilson” (the captain of the Ayacucho)\nhad been many years on the coast, and knew the signs of the weather.\nWe soon had the topsails loosed; and one hand remaining, as usual,\nin each top, to overhaul the rigging and light the sail out, the rest\nof us laid down to man the sheets.  While sheeting home, we saw the\nAyacucho standing athwart our bows, sharp upon the wind, cutting through\nthe head sea like a knife, with her raking masts and sharp bows running\nup like the head of a greyhound.  It was a beautiful sight.  She was\nlike a bird which had been frightened and had spread her wings in flight.\nAfter the topsails had been sheeted home, the head yards braced aback,\nthe fore-top-mast staysail hoisted, and the buoys streamed, and all\nready forward, for slipping, we went aft and manned the slip-rope\nwhich came through the stern port with a turn round the timber-heads.\n\"All ready forward?” asked the captain.  “Aye, aye, sir; all ready,\"\nanswered the mate.  “Let go!”  “All gone, sir;” and the iron cable\ngrated over the windlass and through the hawse-hole, and the little\nvessel’s head swinging off from the wind under the force of her backed\nhead sails, brought the strain upon the slip-rope.  “Let go aft!” \nInstantly all was gone, and we were under weigh.  As soon as she was\nwell off from the wind, we filled away the head yards, braced all\nup sharp, set the foresail and trysail, and left our anchorage well\nastern, giving the point a good berth.  “Nye’s off too,” said the\ncaptain to the mate; and looking astern, we could just see the\nlittle hermaphrodite brig under sail standing after us.",
        "It now began to blow fresh; the rain fell fast, and it grew very\nblack; but the captain would not take in sail until we were well\nclear of the point.  As soon as we left this on our quarter, and were\nstanding out to sea, the order was given, and we sprang aloft,\ndouble reefed each topsail, furled the foresail, and double reefed\nthe trysail, and were soon under easy sail.  In those cases of\nslipping for south-easters, there is nothing to be done, after you\nhave got clear of the coast, but to lie-to under easy sail, and wait\nfor the gale to be over, which seldom lasts more than two days,\nand is often over in twelve hours; but the wind never comes back\nto the southward until there has been a good deal of rain fallen.\n\"Go below the watch,” said the mate; but here was a dispute which\nwatch it should be, which the mate soon however settled by sending\nhis watch below, saying that we should have our turn the next time\nwe got under weigh.  We remained on deck till the expiration of\nthe watch, the wind blowing very fresh and the rain coming down in\ntorrents.  When the watch came up, we wore ship, and stood on the\nother tack, in towards land.  When we came up again, which was at\nfour in the morning, it was very dark, and there was not much wind,\nbut it was raining as I thought I had never seen it rain before.\nWe had on oil-cloth suits and south-wester caps, and had nothing to\ndo but to stand bolt upright and let it pour down upon us.  There are\nno umbrellas, and no sheds to go under, at sea.",
        "While we were standing about on deck, we saw the little brig\ndrifting by us, hove to under her fore topsail double reefed;\nand she glided by like a phantom.  Not a word was spoken, and we\nsaw no one on deck but the man at the wheel.  Toward morning the\ncaptain put his head out of the companion-way and told the second\nmate, who commanded our watch, to look out for a change of wind,\nwhich usually followed a calm and heavy rain; and it was well\nthat he did; for in a few minutes it fell dead calm, the vessel\nlost her steerage-way, and the rain ceased.  We hauled up the\ntrysail and courses, squared the after yards, and waited for the\nchange, which came in a few minutes, with a vengeance, from the\nnorth-west, the opposite point of the compass.  Owing to our\nprecautions, we were not taken aback, but ran before the wind\nwith square yards.  The captain coming on deck, we braced up a\nlittle and stood back for our anchorage.  With the change of wind\ncame a change of weather, and in two hours the wind moderated into\nthe light steady breeze, which blows down the coast the greater\npart of the year, and, from its regularity, might be called a\ntrade-wind.  The sun came up bright, and we set royals, skysails,\nand studding-sails, and were under fair way for Santa Barbara.\nThe little Loriotte was astern of us, nearly out of sight; but we\nsaw nothing of the Ayacucho.  In a short time she appeared,\nstanding out from Santa Rosa Island, under the lee of which she\nhad been hove to, all night.  Our captain was anxious to get in\nbefore her, for it would be a great credit to us, on the coast,\nto beat the Ayacucho, which had been called the best sailer in\nthe North Pacific, in which she had been known as a trader for\nsix years or more.  We had an advantage over her in light winds,\nfrom our royals and skysails which we carried both at the fore\nand main, and also in our studding-sails; for Captain Wilson\ncarried nothing above top-gallant-sails, and always unbent his\nstudding-sails when on the coast.  As the wind was light and fair,\nwe held our own, for some time, when we were both obliged to brace\nup and come upon a taught bowline, after rounding the point; and here\nhe had us on fair ground, and walked away from us, as you would haul\nin a line.  He afterwards said that we sailed well enough with the\nwind free, but that give him a taught bowline, and he would beat us,\nif we had all the canvas of the Royal George.",
        "The Ayacucho got to the anchoring ground about half an hour before us,\nand was furling her sails when we came up to it.  This picking up your\ncables is a very nice piece of work.  It requires some seamanship to\ndo it, and come to at your former moorings, without letting go another\nanchor.  Captain Wilson was remarkable, among the sailors on the coast,\nfor his skill in doing this; and our captain never let go a second\nanchor during all the time that I was with him.  Coming a little to\nwindward of our buoy, we clewed up the light sails, backed our main\ntopsail, and lowered a boat, which pulled off, and made fast a spare\nhawser to the buoy on the end of the slip-rope.  We brought the other\nend to the captain, and hove in upon it until we came to the slip-rope,\nwhich we took to the windlass, and walked her up to her chain, the captain\nhelping her by backing and filling the sails.  The chain is then passed\nthrough the hawse-hole and round the windlass, and bitted, the slip-rope\ntaken round outside and brought into the stern port, and she is safe\nin her old berth.  After we had got through, the mate told us that\nthis was a small touch of California, the like of which we must\nexpect to have through the winter.",
        "After we had furled the sails and got dinner, we saw the Loriotte\nnearing, and she had her anchor before night.  At sun-down we went\nashore again, and found the Loriotte’s boat waiting on the beach.\nThe Sandwich Islander who could speak English, told us that he had\nbeen up to the town; that our agent, Mr. R––-, and some other\npassengers, were going to Monterey with us, and that we were to\nsail the same night.  In a few minutes Captain T––-, with two\ngentlemen and one female, came down, and we got ready to go off.\nThey had a good deal of baggage, which we put into the bows of\nthe boat, and then two of us took the señora in our arms, and waded\nwith her through the water, and put her down safely in the stern.\nShe appeared much amused with the transaction, and her husband was\nperfectly satisfied, thinking any arrangement good which saved his\nwetting his feet.  I pulled the after oar, so that I heard the\nconversation, and learned that one of the men, who, as well as I\ncould see in the darkness, was a young-looking man, in the European\ndress, and covered up in a large cloak, was the agent of the firm\nto which our vessel belonged; and the other, who was dressed in the\nSpanish dress of the country, was a brother of our captain, who had\nbeen many years a trader on the coast, and had married the lady who\nwas in the boat.  She was a delicate, dark-complexioned young woman,\nand of one of the best families in California.  I also found that\nwe were to sail the same night.  As soon as we got on board,\nthe boats were hoisted up, the sails loosed, the windlass manned,\nthe slip-ropes and gear cast off; and after about twenty minutes\nof heaving at the windlass, making sail, and bracing yards, we were\nwell under weigh, and going with a fair wind up the coast to Monterey.\nThe Loriotte got under weigh at the same time, and was also bound up\nto Monterey, but as she took a different course from us, keeping the\nland aboard, while we kept well out to sea, we soon lost sight of her.\nWe had a fair wind, which is something unusual when going up, as the\nprevailing wind is the north, which blows directly down the coast;\nwhence the northern are called the windward, and the southern the\nleeward ports.",
        "We got clear of the islands before sunrise the next morning, and by\ntwelve o’clock were out of the canal, and off Point Conception, the\nplace where we first made the land upon our arrival.  This is the\nlargest point on the coast, and is uninhabited headland, stretching\nout into the Pacific, and has the reputation of being very windy.\nAny vessel does well which gets by it without a gale, especially\nin the winter season.  We were going along with studding-sails set\non both sides, when, as we came round the point, we had to haul our\nwind, and take in the lee studding-sails.  As the brig came more upon\nthe wind, she felt it more, and we doused the sky-sails, but kept\nthe weather studding-sails on her, bracing the yards forward so that\nthe swinging-boom nearly touched the sprit-sail yard.  She now lay\nover to it, the wind was freshening, and the captain was evidently\n\"dragging on to her.”  His brother and Mr. R––-, looking a little\nsqually, said something to him, but he only answered that he knew\nthe vessel and what she would carry.  He was evidently showing off\nhis vessel, and letting them know how he could carry sail.  He stood\nup to windward, holding on by the backstays, and looking up at the\nsticks, to see how much they would bear; when a puff came which\nsettled the matter.  Then it was “haul down,” and “clew up,” royals,\nflying-jib, and studding-sails, all at once.  There was what the\nsailors call a “mess\"–everything let go, nothing hauled in, and\neverything flying.  The poor Spanish woman came to the companion-way,\nlooking as pale as a ghost, and nearly frightened to death.  The mate\nand some men forward were trying to haul in the lower studding-sail,\nwhich had blown over the sprit-sail yard-arm and round the guys;\nwhile the topmast-studding-sail boom, after buckling up and springing\nout again like a piece of whalebone, broke off at the boom-iron.\nI sprang aloft to take in the main top-gallant studding-sail, but\nbefore I got into the top, the tack parted, and away went the sail,\nswinging forward of the top-gallant-sail, and tearing and slatting\nitself to pieces.  The halyards were at this moment let go by the run;\nand such a piece of work I never had before, in taking in a sail.\nAfter great exertions I got it, or the remains of it, into the top,\nand was making it fast, when the captain, looking up, called out\nto me, “Lay aloft there, D––-, and furl that main royal.” Leaving\nthe studding-sail, I went up to the cross trees; and here it looked\nrather squally.  The foot of the top-gallant-mast was working between\nthe cross and trussel trees, and the royal-mast lay over at a fearful\nangle with the mast below, while everything was working, and cracking,\nstrained to the utmost.",
        "There’s nothing for Jack to do but to obey orders, and I went up\nupon the yard; and there was a worse “mess,” if possible, than I\nhad left below.  The braces had been let go, and the yard was swinging\nabout like a turnpike-gate, and the whole sail having blown over to\nleeward, the lee leach was over the yard-arm, and the sky-sail was\nall adrift and flying over my head.  I looked down, but it was in\nvain to attempt to make myself heard, for every one was busy below,\nand the wind roared, and sails were flapping in every direction.\nFortunately, it was noon and broad daylight, and the man at the wheel,\nwho had his eyes aloft, soon saw my difficulty, and after numberless\nsigns and gestures, got some one to haul the necessary ropes taught.\nDuring this interval I took a look below.  Everything was in confusion\non deck; the little vessel was tearing through the water as if she were\nmad, the seas flying over her, and the masts leaning over at an angle\nof forty-five degrees from the vertical.  At the other royal-mast-head\nwas S––-, working away at the sail, which was blowing from him as\nfast as he could gather it in.  The top-gallant-sail below me was\nsoon clewed up, which relieved the mast, and in a short time I got my\nsail furled, and went below; but I lost overboard a new tarpaulin hat,\nwhich troubled me more than anything else.  We worked for about half\nan hour with might and main; and in an hour from the time the squall\nstruck us, from having all our flying kites abroad, we came down to\ndouble-reefed top-sails and the storm-sails.",
        "The wind had hauled ahead during the squall, and we were standing\ndirectly in for the point.  So, as soon as we had got all snug,\nwe wore round and stood off again, and had the pleasant prospect\nof beating up to Monterey, a distance of an hundred miles, against\na violent head wind.  Before night it began to rain; and we had\nfive days of rainy, stormy weather, under close sail all the time,\nand were blown several hundred miles off the coast.  In the midst\nof this, we discovered that our fore topmast was sprung, (which no\ndoubt happened in the squall,) and were obliged to send down the\nfore top-gallant-mast and carry as little sail as possible forward.\nOur four passengers were dreadfully sick, so that we saw little or\nnothing of them during the five days.  On the sixth day it cleared off,\nand the sun came out bright, but the wind and sea were still very high.\nIt was quite like being at sea again: no land for hundreds of miles,\nand the captain taking the sun every day at noon.  Our passengers now\nmade their appearance, and I had for the first time the opportunity\nof seeing what a miserable and forlorn creature a sea-sick passenger\nis.  Since I had got over my own sickness, the third day from Boston,\nI had seen nothing but hale, hearty men, with their sea legs on,\nand able to go anywhere, (for we had no passengers;) and I will own\nthere was a pleasant feeling of superiority in being able to walk the\ndeck, and eat, and go about, and comparing one’s self with two poor,\nmiserable, pale creatures, staggering and shuffling about decks,\nor holding on and looking up with giddy heads, to see us climbing\nto the mast-heads, or sitting quietly at work on the ends of the\nlofty yards.  A well man at sea has little sympathy with one who is\nseasick; he is too apt to be conscious of a comparison favorable\nto his own manhood.  After a few days we made the land at Point Pinos,\n(pines,) which is the headland at the entrance of the bay of Monterey.\nAs we drew in, and ran down the shore, we could distinguish well the\nface of the country, and found it better wooded than that to the\nsouthward of Point Conception.  In fact, as I afterwards discovered,\nPoint Conception may be made the dividing line between two different\nfaces of the country.  As you go to the northward of the point,\nthe country becomes more wooded, has a richer appearance, and is\nbetter supplied with water.  This is the case with Monterey,\nand still more so with San Francisco; while to the southward of\nthe point, as at Santa Barbara, San Pedro, and particularly San Diego,\nthere is very little wood, and the country has a naked, level\nappearance, though it is still very fertile.",
        "The bay of Monterey is very wide at the entrance, being about\ntwenty-four miles between the two points, Año Nuevo at the north,\nand Pinos at the south, but narrows gradually as you approach the\ntown, which is situated in a bend, or large cove, at the south-eastern\nextremity, and about eighteen miles from the points, which makes the\nwhole depth of the bay.  The shores are extremely well wooded,\n(the pine abounding upon them,) and as it was now the rainy season,\neverything was as green as nature could make it,–the grass,\nthe leaves, and all; the birds were singing in the woods, and great\nnumbers of wild-fowl were flying over our heads.  Here we could\nlie safe from the south-easters.  We came to anchor within two\ncable lengths of the shore, and the town lay directly before us,\nmaking a very pretty appearance; its houses being plastered, which\ngives a much better effect than those of Santa Barbara, which are\nof a mud-color.  The red tiles, too, on the roofs, contrasted well\nwith the white plastered sides and with the extreme greenness of\nthe lawn upon which the houses–about an hundred in number–were\ndotted about, here and there, irregularly.  There are in this place,\nand in every other town which I saw in California, no streets, or\nfences, (except here and there a small patch was fenced in for a\ngarden,) so that the houses are placed at random upon the green,\nwhich, as they are of one story and of the cottage form, gives them\na pretty effect when seen from a little distance.",
        "It was a fine Saturday afternoon when we came to anchor, the sun\nabout an hour high, and everything looking pleasantly.  The Mexican\nflag was flying from the little square Presidio, and the drums and\ntrumpets of the soldiers, who were out on parade, sounded over the\nwater, and gave great life to the scene.  Every one was delighted\nwith the appearance of things.  We felt as though we had got into a\nChristian (which in the sailor’s vocabulary means civilized) country.\nThe first impression which California had made upon us was very\ndisagreeable:–the open roadstead of Santa Barbara; anchoring three\nmiles from the shore; running out to sea before every south-easter;\nlanding in a high surf; with a little dark-looking town, a mile from\nthe beach; and not a sound to be heard, or anything to be seen,\nbut Sandwich Islanders, hides, and tallow-bags.  Add to this\nthe gale off Point Conception, and no one can be at a loss to\naccount for our agreeable disappointment in Monterey.  Beside all\nthis, we soon learned, which was of no small importance to us,\nthat there was little or no surf here, and this afternoon the\nbeach was as smooth as a duck-pond.",
        "We landed the agent and passengers, and found several persons\nwaiting for them on the beach, among whom were some, who, though\ndressed in the costume of the country, spoke English; and who,\nwe afterwards learned, were English and Americans who had\nmarried and settled in the country.",
        "I also connected with our arrival here another circumstance which\nmore nearly concerns myself; viz, my first act of what the sailors\nwill allow to be seamanship–sending down a royal-yard.  I had seen\nit done once or twice at sea, and an old sailor, whose favor I\nhad taken some pains to gain, had taught me carefully everything\nwhich was necessary to be done, and in its proper order, and advised\nme to take the first opportunity when we were in port, and try it.\nI told the second mate, with whom I had been pretty thick when he\nwas before the mast, that I would do it, and got him to ask the mate\nto send me up the first time they were struck.  Accordingly I was\ncalled upon, and went up, repeating the operations over in my mind,\ntaking care to get everything in its order, for the slightest mistake\nspoils the whole.  Fortunately, I got through without any word from\nthe officer, and heard the “well done” of the mate, when the yard\nreached the deck, with as much satisfaction as I ever felt at Cambridge\non seeing a “bene” at the foot of a Latin exercise.",
        "The next day being Sunday, which is the liberty-day among merchantmen,\nwhen it is usual to let a part of the crew go ashore, the sailors had\ndepended upon a day on land, and were already disputing who should\nask to go, when, upon being called in the morning, we were turned-to\nupon the rigging, and found that the topmast, which had been sprung,\nwas to come down, and a new one to go up, and top-gallant and royal-masts,\nand the rigging to be set up.  This was too bad.  If there is anything that\nirritates sailors and makes them feel hardly used, it is being deprived\nof their Sabbath.  Not that they would always, or indeed generally,\nspend it religiously, but it is their only day of rest.  Then, too,\nthey are often necessarily deprived of it by storms, and unavoidable\nduties of all kinds, that to take it from them when lying quietly\nand safely in port, without any urgent reason, bears the more hardly.\nThe only reason in this case was, that the captain had determined to\nhave the custom-house officers on board on Monday, and wished to have\nhis brig in order.  Jack is a slave aboard ship; but still he has\nmany opportunities of thwarting and balking his master.  When there\nis danger, or necessity, or when he is well used, no one can work\nfaster than he; but the instant he feels that he is kept at work\nfor nothing, no sloth could make less headway.  He must not refuse\nhis duty, or be in any way disobedient, but all the work that an\nofficer gets out of him, he may be welcome to.  Every man who has\nbeen three months at sea knows how to “work Tom Cox’s traverse\"–\n\"three turns round the long-boat, and a pull at the scuttled-butt.\"\nThis morning everything went in this way.  “Sogering” was the order\nof the day.  Send a man below to get a block, and he would capsize\neverything before finding it, then not bring it up till an officer\nhad called him twice, and take as much time to put things in order\nagain.  Marline-spikes were not to be found; knives wanted a prodigious\ndeal of sharpening, and, generally, three or four were waiting round\nthe grindstone at a time.  When a man got to the mast-head, he would\ncome slowly down again to get something which he had forgotten;\nand after the tackles were got up, six men would pull less than\nthree who pulled “with a will.”  When the mate was out of sight,\nnothing was done.  It was all uphill work; and at eight o’clock,\nwhen we went to breakfast, things were nearly where they were\nwhen we began.",
        "During our short meal, the matter was discussed.  One proposed\nrefusing to work; but that was mutiny, and of course was rejected\nat once.  I remember, too, that one of the men quoted “Father\nTaylor,” (as they call the seamen’s preacher at Boston,) who told\nthem that if they were ordered to work on Sunday, they must not\nrefuse their duty, and the blame would not come upon them.  After\nbreakfast, it leaked out, through the officers, that if we would get\nthrough our work soon, we might have a boat in the afternoon and\ngo fishing.  This bait was well thrown, and took with several who\nwere fond of fishing; and all began to find that as we had one thing\nto do, and were not to be kept at work for the day, the sooner we\ndid it, the better.",
        "Accordingly, things took a new aspect; and before two o’clock this\nwork, which was in a fair way to last two days, was done; and five of\nus went a fishing in the jolly-boat, in the direction of Point Pinos;\nbut leave to go ashore was refused.  Here we saw the Loriotte, which\nsailed with us from Santa Barbara, coming slowly in with a light\nsea-breeze, which sets in towards afternoon, having been becalmed\noff the point all the first part of the day.  We took several fish\nof various kinds, among which cod and perch abounded, and F––-,\n(the ci-devant second mate,) who was of our number, brought up with\nhis hook a large and beautiful pearl-oyster shell.  We afterwards\nlearned that this place was celebrated for shells, and that a small\nschooner had made a good voyage, by carrying a cargo of them to\nthe United States.",
        "We returned by sun-down, and found the Loriotte at anchor,\nwithin a cable’s length of the Pilgrim.  The next day we were\n\"turned-to” early, and began taking off the hatches, overhauling\nthe cargo, and getting everything ready for inspection.  At eight,\nthe officers of the customs, five in number, came on board,\nand began overhauling the cargo, manifest, etc.",
        "The Mexican revenue laws are very strict, and require the whole\ncargo to be landed, examined, and taken on board again; but our\nagent, Mr. R––-, had succeeded in compounding with them for the\ntwo last vessels, and saving the trouble of taking the cargo ashore.\nThe officers were dressed in the costume which we found prevailed\nthrough the country.  A broad-brimmed hat, usually of a black or\ndark-brown color, with a gilt or figured band round the crown, and\nlined inside with silk; a short jacket of silk or figured calico,\n(the European skirted body-coat is never worn;) the shirt open in the\nneck; rich waistcoat, if any; pantaloons wide, straight, and long,\nusually of velvet, velveteen, or broadcloth; or else short breeches\nand white stockings.  They wear the deer-skin shoe, which is of a\ndark-brown color, and, (being made by Indians,) usually a good deal\nornamented.  They have no suspenders, but always wear a sash round\nthe waist, which is generally red, and varying in quality with the\nmeans of the wearer.  Add to this the never-failing cloak, and you\nhave the dress of the Californian.  This last garment, the cloak, is\nalways a mark of the rank and wealth of the owner.  The “gente de razón,\"\nor aristocracy, wear cloaks of black or dark blue broadcloth, with as\nmuch velvet and trimmings as may be; and from this they go down to the\nblanket of the Indian; the middle classes wearing something like a\nlarge table-cloth, with a hole in the middle for the head to go through.\nThis is often as coarse as a blanket, but being beautifully woven with\nvarious colors, is quite showy at a distance.  Among the Mexicans there is\nno working class; (the Indians being slaves and doing all the hard work;)\nand every rich man looks like a grandee, and every poor scamp like a\nbroken-down gentleman.  I have often seen a man with a fine figure,\nand courteous manners, dressed in broadcloth and velvet, with a noble\nhorse completely covered with trappings; without a real in his pocket,\nand absolutely suffering for something to eat.",
        "The next day, the cargo having been entered in due form, we began\ntrading.  The trade-room was fitted up in the steerage, and furnished\nout with the lighter goods, and with specimens of the rest of the\ncargo; and M––-, a young man who came out from Boston with us,\nbefore the mast, was taken out of the forecastle, and made supercargo’s\nclerk.  He was well qualified for the business, having been clerk in a\ncounting-house in Boston.  He had been troubled for some time with\nthe rheumatism, which unfitted him for the wet and exposed duty of\na sailor on the coast.  For a week or ten days all was life on board.\nThe people came off to look and to buy–men, women, and children;\nand we were continually going in the boats, carrying goods and\npassengers,–for they have no boats of their own.  Everything must\ndress itself and come aboard and see the new vessel, if it were only\nto buy a paper of pins.  The agent and his clerk managed the sales,\nwhile we were busy in the hold or in the boats.  Our cargo was an\nassorted one; that is, it consisted of everything under the sun.\nWe had spirits of all kinds, (sold by the cask,) teas, coffee, sugars,\nspices, raisins, molasses, hardware, crockery-ware, tinware, cutlery,\nclothing of all kinds, boots and shoes from Lynn, calicoes and cottons\nfrom Lowell, crepes, silks; also shawls, scarfs, necklaces, jewelry,\nand combs for the ladies; furniture; and in fact, everything that can\nbe imagined, from Chinese fire-works to English cart-wheels–of which\nwe had a dozen pairs with their iron rims on.",
        "The Californians are an idle, thriftless people, and can make \nnothing for themselves.  The country abounds in grapes, yet they\nbuy bad wines made in Boston and brought round by us, at an immense\nprice, and retail it among themselves at a real (12½ cents) by\nthe small wine-glass.  Their hides, too, which they value at two\ndollars in money, they give for something which costs seventy-five\ncents in Boston; and buy shoes (like as not, made of their own hides,\nand which have been carried twice around Cape Horn) at three or\nfour dollars, and “chicken-skin” boots at fifteen dollars apiece.\nThings sell, on an average, at an advance of nearly three hundred\nper cent upon the Boston prices.  This is partly owing to the heavy\nduties which the government, in their wisdom, with the intent, no\ndoubt, of keeping the silver in the country, has laid upon imports.\nThese duties, and the enormous expenses of so long a voyage, keep\nall merchants, but those of heavy capital, from engaging in the\ntrade.  Nearly two-thirds of all the articles imported into the\ncountry from round Cape Horn, for the last six years, have been by\nthe single house of Bryant, Sturgis & Co., to whom our vessel belonged,\nand who have a permanent agent on the coast.",
        "This kind of business was new to us, and we liked it very well for\na few days, though we were hard at work every minute from daylight\nto dark; and sometimes even later.",
        "By being thus continually engaged in transporting passengers with\ntheir goods, to and fro, we gained considerable knowledge of the\ncharacter, dress, and language of the people.  The dress of the\nmen was as I have before described it.  The women wore gowns of\nvarious texture–silks, crape, calicoes, etc.,–made after the\nEuropean style, except that the sleeves were short, leaving the arm\nbare, and that they were loose about the waist, having no corsets.\nThey wore shoes of kid, or satin; sashes or belts of bright colors;\nand almost always a necklace and ear-rings.  Bonnets they had none.\nI only saw one on the coast, and that belonged to the wife of an\nAmerican sea-captain who had settled in San Diego, and had imported\nthe chaotic mass of straw and ribbon, as a choice present to his\nnew wife.  They wear their hair (which is almost invariably black,\nor a very dark brown) long in their necks, sometimes loose,\nand sometimes in long braids; though the married women often\ndo it up on a high comb.  Their only protection against the sun\nand weather is a large mantle which they put over their heads,\ndrawing it close round their faces, when they go out of doors,\nwhich is generally only in pleasant weather.  When in the house,\nor sitting out in front of it, which they often do in fine weather,\nthey usually wear a small scarf or neckerchief of a rich pattern.\nA band, also, about the top of the head, with a cross, star, or\nother ornament in front, is common.  Their complexions are various,\ndepending–as well as their dress and manner–upon their rank; or,\nin other words, upon the amount of Spanish blood they can lay claim to.\nThose who are of pure Spanish blood, having never intermarried with\nthe aborigines, have clear brunette complexions, and sometimes, even\nas fair as those of English women.  There are but few of these families\nin California; being mostly those in official stations, or who, on the\nexpiration of their offices, have settled here upon property which they\nhave acquired; and others who have been banished for state offences.\nThese form the aristocracy; inter-marrying, and keeping up an exclusive\nsystem in every respect.  They can be told by their complexions, dress,\nmanner, and also by their speech; for, calling themselves Castilians,\nthey are very ambitious of speaking the pure Castilian language,\nwhich is spoken in a somewhat corrupted dialect by the lower\nclasses.  From this upper class, they go down by regular shades,\ngrowing more and more dark and muddy, until you come to the pure\nIndian, who runs about with nothing upon him but a small piece\nof cloth, kept up by a wide leather strap drawn round his waist.\nGenerally speaking, each person’s caste is decided by the quality\nof the blood, which shows itself, too plainly to be concealed,\nat first sight.  Yet the least drop of Spanish blood, if it be\nonly of quadroon or octoroon, is sufficient to raise them from\nthe rank of slaves, and entitle them to a suit of clothes–boots,\nhat, cloak, spurs, long knife, and all complete, though coarse\nand dirty as may be,–and to call themselves Españolos, and to\nhold property, if they can get any.",
        "The fondness for dress among the women is excessive, and is often\nthe ruin of many of them.  A present of a fine mantle, or of a\nnecklace or pair of ear-rings, gains the favor of the greater part\nof them.  Nothing is more common than to see a woman living in\na house of only two rooms, and the ground for a floor, dressed in\nspangled satin shoes, silk gown, high comb, and gilt, if not gold,\near-rings and necklace.  If their husbands do not dress them well\nenough, they will soon receive presents from others.  They used to\nspend whole days on board our vessels, examining the fine clothes\nand ornaments, and frequently made purchases at a rate which\nwould have made a seamstress or waiting-maid in Boston open\nher eyes.",
        "Next to the love of dress, I was most struck with the fineness of\nthe voices and beauty of the intonations of both sexes.  Every\ncommon ruffian-looking fellow, with a slouched hat, blanket cloak,\ndirty under-dress, and soiled leather leggins, appeared to me to be\nspeaking elegant Spanish.  It was a pleasure, simply to listen to\nthe sound of the language, before I could attach any meaning to it.\nThey have a good deal of the Creole drawl, but it is varied with an\noccasional extreme rapidity of utterance, in which they seem to skip\nfrom consonant to consonant, until, lighting upon a broad, open\nvowel, they rest upon that to restore the balance of sound.  The\nwomen carry this peculiarity of speaking to a much greater extreme\nthan the men, who have more evenness and stateliness of utterance.\nA common bullock-driver, on horseback, delivering a message, seemed\nto speak like an ambassador at an audience.  In fact, they sometimes\nappeared to me to be a people on whom a curse had fallen, and stripped\nthem of everything but their pride, their manners, and their voices.",
        "Another thing that surprised me was the quantity of silver that\nwas in circulation.  I certainly never saw so much silver at one\ntime in my life, as during the week that we were at Monterey.\nThe truth is, they have no credit system, no banks, and no way\nof investing money but in cattle.  They have no circulating medium\nbut silver and hides–which the sailors call “California bank notes.\"\nEverything that they buy they must pay for in one or the other of\nthese things.  The hides they bring down dried and doubled, in\nclumsy ox-carts, or upon mules’ backs, and the money they carry\ntied up in a handkerchief;–fifty, eighty, or an hundred dollars\nand half dollars.",
        "I had never studied Spanish while at college, and could not speak\na word, when at Juan Fernandez; but during the latter part of the\npassage out, I borrowed a grammar and dictionary from the cabin,\nand by a continual use of these, and a careful attention to every word\nthat I heard spoken, I soon got a vocabulary together, and began\ntalking for myself.  As I soon knew more Spanish than any of the\ncrew, (who indeed knew none at all,) and had been at college and\nknew Latin, I got the name of a great linguist, and was always sent\nfor by the captain and officers to get provisions, or to carry letters\nand messages to different parts of the town.  I was often sent to get\nsomething which I could not tell the name of to save my life; but\nI liked the business, and accordingly never pleaded ignorance.\nSometimes I managed to jump below and take a look at my dictionary\nbefore going ashore; or else I overhauled some English resident\non my way, and got the word from him; and then, by signs, and the\nhelp of my Latin and French, contrived to get along.  This was a\ngood exercise for me, and no doubt taught me more than I should\nhave learned by months of study and reading; it also gave me\nopportunities of seeing the customs, characters, and domestic\narrangements of the people; beside being a great relief from\nthe monotony of a day spent on board ship.",
        "Monterey, as far as my observation goes, is decidedly the pleasantest\nand most civilized-looking place in California.  In the centre\nof it is an open square, surrounded by four lines of one-story\nplastered buildings, with half a dozen cannon in the centre; some\nmounted, and others not.  This is the “Presidio,” or fort.  Every\ntown has a presidio in its centre; or rather, every presidio has a\ntown built around it; for the forts were first built by the Mexican\ngovernment, and then the people built near them for protection.  The\npresidio here was entirely open and unfortified.  There were several\nofficers with long titles, and about eighty soldiers, but they were\npoorly paid, fed, clothed, and disciplined.  The governor-general,\nor, as he is commonly called, the “general,” lives here; which makes\nit the seat of government.  He is appointed by the central government\nat Mexico, and is the chief civil and military officer.  In addition to\nhim, each town has a commandant, who is the chief military officer,\nand has charge of the fort, and of all transactions with foreigners\nand foreign vessels; and two or three alcaldes and corregidores,\nelected by the inhabitants, who are the civil officers.  Courts and\njurisprudence they have no knowledge of.  Small municipal matters are\nregulated by the alcaldes and corregidores; and everything relating\nto the general government, to the military, and to foreigners,\nby the commandants, acting under the governor-general.  Capital\ncases are decided by him, upon personal inspection, if he is near;\nor upon minutes sent by the proper officers, if the offender is at a\ndistant place.  No Protestant has any civil rights, nor can he hold\nany property, or, indeed, remain more than a few weeks on shore,\nunless he belong to some vessel.  Consequently, the Americans and\nEnglish who intend to remain here become Catholics, to a man;\nthe current phrase among them being,–\"A man must leave his\nconscience at Cape Horn.”",
        "But to return to Monterey.  The houses here, as everywhere else\nin California, are of one story, built of clay made into large bricks,\nabout a foot and a half square and three or four inches thick, and\nhardened in the sun.  These are cemented together by mortar of the\nsame material, and the whole are of a common dirt-color.  The floors\nare generally of earth, the windows grated and without glass; and\nthe doors, which are seldom shut, open directly into the common\nroom; there being no entries.  Some of the more wealthy inhabitants\nhave glass to their windows and board floors; and in Monterey\nnearly all the houses are plastered on the outside.  The better houses,\ntoo, have red tiles upon the roofs.  The common ones have two or\nthree rooms which open into each other, and are furnished with a\nbed or two, a few chairs and tables, a looking-glass, a crucifix of\nsome material or other, and small daubs of paintings enclosed in\nglass, and representing some miracle or martyrdom.  They have no\nchimneys or fire-places in the houses, the climate being such as to\nmake a fire unnecessary; and all their cooking is done in a small\ncook-house, separated from the house.  The Indians, as I have said\nbefore, do all the hard work, two or three being attached to each\nhouse; and the poorest persons are able to keep one, at least, for\nthey have only to feed them and give them a small piece of coarse\ncloth and a belt, for the males; and a coarse gown, without shoes\nor stockings, for the females.",
        "In Monterey there are a number of English and Americans (English\nor “Ingles” all are called who speak the English language) who\nhave married Californians, become united to the Catholic church,\nand acquired considerable property.  Having more industry, frugality,\nand enterprise than the natives, they soon get nearly all the\ntrade into their hands.  They usually keep shops, in which they\nretail the goods purchased in larger quantities from our vessels,\nand also send a good deal into the interior, taking hides in pay,\nwhich they again barter with our vessels.  In every town on the coast\nthere are foreigners engaged in this kind of trade, while I recollect\nbut two shops kept by natives.  The people are generally suspicious\nof foreigners, and they would not be allowed to remain, were it not\nthat they become good Catholics, and by marrying natives, and\nbringing up their children as Catholics and Mexicans, and not\nteaching them the English language, they quiet suspicion, and even\nbecome popular and leading men.  The chief alcaldes in Monterey and\nSanta Barbara were both Yankees by birth.",
        "The men in Monterey appeared to me to be always on horseback.\nHorses are as abundant here as dogs and chickens were in Juan\nFernandez. There are no stables to keep them in, but they are\nallowed to run wild and graze wherever they please, being branded,\nand having long leather ropes, called “lassos,” attached to their\nnecks and dragging along behind them, by which they can be easily\ntaken.  The men usually catch one in the morning, throw a saddle and\nbridle upon him, and use him for the day, and let him go at night,\ncatching another the next day.  When they go on long journeys,\nthey ride one horse down, and catch another, throw the saddle and\nbridle upon him, and after riding him down, take a third, and so\non to the end of the journey.  There are probably no better riders\nin the world.  They get upon a horse when only four or five years\nold, their little legs not long enough to come half way over his\nsides; and may almost be said to keep on him until they have grown\nto him.  The stirrups are covered or boxed up in front, to prevent\ntheir catching when riding through the woods; and the saddles are\nlarge and heavy, strapped very tight upon the horse, and have\nlarge pommels, or loggerheads, in front, round which the “lasso\"\nis coiled when not in use.  They can hardly go from one house to\nanother without getting on a horse, there being generally several\nstanding tied to the door-posts of the little cottages.  When they\nwish to show their activity, they make no use of their stirrups\nin mounting, but striking the horse, spring into the saddle as\nhe starts, and sticking their long spurs into him, go off on\nthe full run.  Their spurs are cruel things, having four or five\nrowels, each an inch in length, dull and rusty.  The flanks of\nthe horses are often sore from them, and I have seen men come in\nfrom chasing bullocks with their horses’ hind legs and quarters\ncovered with blood.  They frequently give exhibitions of their\nhorsemanship, in races, bull-baitings, etc.; but as we were not\nashore during any holyday, we saw nothing of it.  Monterey is also\na great place for cock-fighting, gambling of all sorts, fandangos,\nand every kind of amusement and knavery.  Trappers and hunters, who\noccasionally arrive here from over the Rocky mountains, with their\nvaluable skins and furs, are often entertained with every sort of\namusement and dissipation, until they have wasted their time and\ntheir money, and go back, stripped of everything.",
        "Nothing but the character of the people prevents Monterey from\nbecoming a great town.  The soil is as rich as man could wish;\nclimate as good as any in the world; water abundant, and situation\nextremely beautiful.  The harbor, too, is a good one, being subject\nonly to one bad wind, the north; and though the holding-ground is\nnot the best, yet I heard of but one vessel’s being driven ashore\nhere.  That was a Mexican brig, which went ashore a few months\nbefore our arrival, and was a total wreck, all the crew but one being\ndrowned.  Yet this was from the carelessness or ignorance of the\ncaptain, who paid out all his small cable before he let go his other\nanchor.  The ship Lagoda, of Boston, was there at the time, and rode\nout the gale in safety, without dragging at all, or finding it necessary\nto strike her top-gallant masts.",
        "The only vessel in port with us was the little Loriotte.  I frequently\nwent on board her, and became very well acquainted with her\nSandwich Island crew.  One of them could speak a little English,\nand from him I learned a good deal about them.  They were well\nformed and active, with black eyes, intelligent countenances,\ndark-olive, or, I should rather say, copper complexions and coarse\nblack hair, but not woolly like the negroes.  They appeared to be\ntalking continually.  In the forecastle there was a complete Babel.\nTheir language is extremely guttural, and not pleasant at first,\nbut improves as you hear it more, and is said to have great capacity.\nThey use a good deal of gesticulation, and are exceedingly animated,\nsaying with their might what their tongues find to say.  They are\ncomplete water-dogs, therefore very good in boating.  It is for this\nreason that there are so many of them on the coast of California;\nthey being very good hands in the surf.  They are also quick and\nactive in the rigging, and good hands in warm weather; but those\nwho have been with them round Cape Horn, and in high latitudes,\nsay that they are useless in cold weather.  In their dress they are\nprecisely like our sailors.  In addition to these Islanders, the vessel\nhad two English sailors, who acted as boatswains over the Islanders,\nand took care of the rigging.  One of them I shall always remember as\nthe best specimen of the thoroughbred English sailor that I ever saw.\nHe had been to sea from a boy, having served a regular apprenticeship\nof seven years, as all English sailors are obliged to do, and was\nthen about four or five and twenty.  He was tall; but you only\nperceived it when he was standing by the side of others, for the\ngreat breadth of his shoulders and chest made him appear but little\nabove the middle height.  His chest was as deep as it was wide;\nhis arm like that of Hercules; and his hand “the fist of a tar\n–every hair a rope-yarn.” With all this he had one of the pleasantest\nsmiles I ever saw.  His cheeks were of a handsome brown; his teeth\nbrilliantly white; and his hair, of a raven black, waved in loose\ncurls all over his head, and fine, open forehead; and his eyes\nhe might have sold to a duchess at the price of diamonds, for their\nbrilliancy.  As for their color, they were like the Irishman’s pig,\nwhich would not stay to be counted, every change of position and\nlight seemed to give them a new hue; but their prevailing color was\nblack, or nearly so.  Take him with his well-varnished black tarpaulin\nstuck upon the back of his head; his long locks coming down almost\ninto his eyes; his white duck trowsers and shirt; blue jacket;\nand black kerchief, tied loosely round his neck; and he was a fine\nspecimen of manly beauty.  On his broad chest he had stamped with\nIndia ink “Parting moments;\"–a ship ready to sail; a boat on the\nbeach; and a girl and her sailor lover taking their farewell.\nUnderneath were printed the initials of his own name, and two other\nletters, standing for some name which he knew better than I did.\nThis was very well done, having been executed by a man who made\nit his business to print with India ink, for sailors, at Havre.\nOn one of his broad arms, he had the crucifixion, and on the other\nthe sign of the “foul anchor.”",
        "He was very fond of reading, and we lent him most of the books\nwhich we had in the forecastle, which he read and returned\nto us the next time we fell in with him.  He had a good deal\nof information, and his captain said he was a perfect seaman,\nand worth his weight in gold on board a vessel, in fair weather\nand in foul.  His strength must have been great, and he had the\nsight of a vulture.  It is strange that one should be so minute in\nthe description of an unknown, outcast sailor, whom one may never\nsee again, and whom no one may care to hear about; but so it is.\nSome people we see under no remarkable circumstances, but whom,\nfor some reason or other, we never forget.  He called himself Bill\nJackson; and I know no one of all my accidental acquaintances to\nwhom I would more gladly give a shake of the hand than to him.\nWhoever falls in with him will find a handsome, hearty fellow,\nand a good shipmate.",
        "Sunday came again while we were at Monterey, but as before, it brought\nus no holyday.  The people on shore dressed themselves and came off in\ngreater numbers than ever, and we were employed all day in boating and\nbreaking out cargo, so that we had hardly time to eat.  Our cidevant\nsecond mate, who was determined to get liberty if it was to be had,\ndressed himself in a long coat and black hat, and polished his shoes,\nand went aft and asked to go ashore.  He could not have done a more\nimprudent thing; for he knew that no liberty would be given; and besides,\nsailors, however sure they may be of having liberty granted them always\ngo aft in their working clothes, to appear as though they had no reason\nto expect anything, and then wash, dress, and shave, after they get\ntheir liberty.  But this poor fellow was always getting into hot water,\nand if there was a wrong way of doing a thing, was sure to hit upon it.\nWe looked to see him go aft, knowing pretty well what his reception\nwould be.  The captain was walking the quarter-deck, smoking his\nmorning cigar, and F––- went as far as the break of the deck, and there\nwaited for him to notice him.  The captain took two or three turns,\nand then walking directly up to him, surveyed him from head to foot,\nand lifting up his forefinger, said a word or two, in a tone too low\nfor us to hear, but which had a magical effect upon poor F––-.\nHe walked forward, sprang into the forecastle, and in a moment more\nmade his appearance in his common clothes, and went quietly to work again.\nWhat the captain said to him, we never could get him to tell, but it\ncertainly changed him outwardly and inwardly in a most surprising manner.",
        "After a few days, finding the trade beginning to slacken, we\nhove our anchor up, set our topsails, ran the stars and stripes\nup to the peak, fired a gun, which was returned from the Presidio,\nand left the little town astern, running out of the bay, and\nbearing down the coast again, for Santa Barbara.  As we were now\ngoing to leeward, we had a fair wind and a plenty of it.  After\ndoubling Point Pinos, we bore up, set studding-sails alow and aloft,\nand were walking off at the rate of eight or nine knots, promising\nto traverse in twenty-four hours the distance which we were nearly\nthree weeks in traversing on the passage up.  We passed Point\nConception at a flying rate, the wind blowing so that it would have\nseemed half a gale to us, if we had been going the other way and\nclose hauled.  As we drew near the islands off Santa Barbara, it\ndied away a little but we came-to at our old anchoring-ground in\nless than thirty hours from the time of leaving Monterey.",
        "Here everything was pretty much as we left it–the large bay without\na vessel in it; the surf roaring and rolling in upon the beach;\nthe white mission; the dark town and the high, treeless mountains.\nHere, too, we had our south-easter tacks aboard again,–slip-ropes,\nbuoy-ropes, sails furled with reefs in them, and rope-yarns for gaskets.\nWe lay here about a fortnight, employed in landing goods and taking\noff hides, occasionally, when the surf was not high; but there did\nnot appear to be one-half the business doing here that there was\nin Monterey.  In fact, so far as we were concerned, the town might\nalmost as well have been in the middle of the Cordilleras.  We lay\nat a distance of three miles from the beach, and the town was nearly\na mile farther; so that we saw little or nothing of it.  Occasionally\nwe landed a few goods, which were taken away by Indians in large,\nclumsy ox-carts, with the yoke on the ox’s neck instead of under it,\nand with small solid wheels.  A few hides were brought down, which we\ncarried off in the California style.  This we had now got pretty well\naccustomed to; and hardened to also; for it does require a little\nhardening even to the toughest.",
        "The hides are always brought down dry, or they would not be received.\nWhen they are taken from the animal, they have holes cut in the ends,\nand are staked out, and thus dried in the sun without shrinking.\nThey are then doubled once, lengthwise, with the hair side usually in,\nand sent down, upon mules or in carts, and piled above highwater mark;\nand then we rake them upon our heads, one at a time, or two, if they\nare small, and wade out with them and throw them into the boat,\nwhich as there are no wharves, we are usually kept anchored by a\nsmall kedge, or keelek, just outside of the surf.  We all provided\nourselves with thick Scotch caps, which would be soft to the head,\nand at the same time protect it; for we soon found that however it\nmight look or feel at first the “head-work” was the only system for\nCalifornia.  For besides that the seas, breaking high, often obliged\nus to carry the hides so, in order to keep them dry, we found that,\nas they were very large and heavy, and nearly as stiff as boards,\nit was the only way that we could carry them with any convenience\nto ourselves.  Some of the crew tried other expedients, saying that\nthey looked too much like West India negroes; but they all came to\nit at last.  The great art is in getting them on the head.  We had\nto take them from the ground, and as they were often very heavy,\nand as wide as the arms could stretch and easily taken by the wind,\nwe used to have some trouble with them.  I have often been laughed\nat myself, and joined in laughing at others, pitching themselves\ndown in the sand, trying to swing a large hide upon their heads,\nor nearly blown over with one in a little gust of wind.  The captain\nmade it harder for us, by telling us that it was “California fashion\"\nto carry two on the head at a time; and as he insisted upon it,\nand we did not wish to be outdone by other vessels, we carried two\nfor the first few months; but after falling in with a few other\n\"hide-droghers,” and finding that they carried only one at a time we\n\"knocked off” the extra one, and thus made our duty somewhat easier.",
        "After we had got our heads used to the weight, and had learned the\ntrue California style of tossing a hide, we could carry off two or\nthree hundred in a short time, without much trouble; but it was\nalways wet work, and, if the beach was stony, bad for our feet;\nfor we, of course, always went barefooted on this duty, as no shoes\ncould stand such constant wetting with salt water.  Then, too, we\nhad a long pull of three miles, with a loaded boat, which often\ntook a couple of hours.",
        "We had now got well settled down into our harbor duties, which,\nas they are a good deal different from those at sea, it may be\nwell enough to describe.  In the first place, all hands are called\nat daylight, or rather–especially if the days are short–before\ndaylight, as soon as the first grey of the morning.  The cook makes\nhis fire in the galley; the steward goes about his work in the cabin;\nand the crew rig the head pump, and wash down the decks.  The chief\nmate is always on deck, but takes no active part, all the duty coming\nupon the second mate, who has to roll up his trowsers and paddle about\ndecks barefooted, like the rest of the crew.  The washing, swabbing,\nsquilgeeing, etc., lasts, or is made to last, until eight o’clock,\nwhen breakfast is ordered, fore and aft.  After breakfast, for which\nhalf an hour is allowed, the boats are lowered down, and made fast\nastern, or out to the swinging booms, by ges-warps, and the crew\nare turned-to upon their day’s work.  This is various, and its\ncharacter depends upon circumstances.  There is always more or\nless of boating, in small boats; and if heavy goods are to be\ntaken ashore, or hides are brought down to the beach for us,\nthen all hands are sent ashore with an officer in the long boat.\nThen there is always a good deal to be done in the hold: goods to\nbe broken out; and cargo to be shifted, to make room for hides,\nor to keep the trim of the vessel.  In addition to this, the usual\nwork upon the rigging must be done.  There is a good deal of the\nlatter kind of work which can only be done when the vessel is in\nport;–and then everything must be kept taught and in good order;\nspun-yarn made; chafing gear repaired; and all the other ordinary\nwork.  The great difference between sea and harbor duty is in the\ndivision of time.  Instead of having a watch on deck and a watch\nbelow, as at sea, all hands are at work together, except at meal\ntimes, from daylight till dark; and at night an “anchor-watch” is\nkept, which consists of only two at a time; the whole crew taking\nturns.  An hour is allowed for dinner, and at dark, the decks are\ncleared up; the boats hoisted; supper ordered; and at eight, the\nlights put out, except in the binnacle, where the glass stands;\nand the anchor-watch is set.  Thus, when at anchor, the crew have\nmore time at night, (standing watch only about two hours,) but have\nno time to themselves in the day; so that reading, mending clothes,\netc., has to be put off until Sunday, which is usually given.\nSome religious captains give their crews Saturday afternoons\nto do their washing and mending in, so that they may have their\nSundays free.  This is a good arrangement, and does much toward\ncreating the preference sailors usually show for religious vessels.\nWe were well satisfied if we got Sunday to ourselves, for, if any\nhides came down on that day, as was often the case when they were\nbrought from a distance, we were obliged to bring them off, which\nusually took half a day; and as we now lived on fresh beef, and ate\none bullock a week, the animal was almost always brought down on\nSunday, and we had to go ashore, kill it, dress it, and bring it\naboard, which was another interruption.   Then, too, our common\nday’s work was protracted and made more fatiguing by hides coming\ndown late in the afternoon, which sometimes kept us at work in\nthe surf by star-light, with the prospect of pulling on board,\nand stowing them all away, before supper.",
        "But all these little vexations and labors would have been nothing,\n–they would have been passed by as the common evils of a sea-life,\nwhich every sailor, who is a man, will go through without complaint,\n–were it not for the uncertainty, or worse than uncertainty,\nwhich hung over the nature and length of our voyage.  Here we were,\nin a little vessel, with a small crew, on a half-civilized coast,\nat the ends of the earth, and with a prospect of remaining an\nindefinite period, two or three years at the least.  When we left\nBoston we supposed that it was to be a voyage of eighteen months,\nor two years, at most; but upon arriving on the coast, we learned\nsomething more of the trade, and found that in the scarcity of\nhides, which was yearly greater and greater, it would take us a\nyear, at least, to collect our own cargo, beside the passage out\nand home; and that we were also to collect a cargo for a large ship\nbelonging to the same firm, which was soon to come on the coast,\nand to which we were to act as tender.  We had heard rumors of\nsuch a ship to follow us, which had leaked out from the captain\nand mate, but we passed them by as mere “yarns,” till our arrival,\nwhen they were confirmed by the letters which we brought from\nthe owners to their agent.  The ship California, belonging to the\nsame firm, had been nearly two years on the coast; had collected \na full cargo, and was now at San Diego, from which port she was\nexpected to sail in a few weeks for Boston; and we were to collect\nall the hides we could, and deposit them at San Diego, when the new\nship, which would carry forty thousand, was to be filled and sent\nhome; and then we were to begin anew, and collect our own cargo.\nHere was a gloomy prospect before us, indeed.  The California had\nbeen twenty months on the coast, and the Lagoda, a smaller ship,\ncarrying only thirty-one or thirty-two thousand, had been two years\ngetting her cargo; and we were to collect a cargo of forty thousand\nbeside our own, which would be twelve or fifteen thousand; and hides\nwere said to be growing scarcer.  Then, too, this ship, which had\nbeen to us a worse phantom than any flying Dutchman, was no phantom,\nor ideal thing, but had been reduced to a certainty; so much so that\na name was given her, and it was said that she was to be the Alert,\na well-known India-man, which was expected in Boston in a few months,\nwhen we sailed.  There could be no doubt, and all looked black enough.\nHints were thrown out about three years and four years;–the older\nsailors said they never should see Boston again, but should lay their\nbones in California; and a cloud seemed to hang over the whole voyage.\nBesides, we were not provided for so long a voyage, and clothes, and\nall sailors’ necessaries, were excessively dear–three or four hundred\nper cent. advance upon the Boston prices.  This was bad enough\nfor them; but still worse was it for me, who did not mean to be a\nsailor for life; having intended only to be gone eighteen months or\ntwo years.  Three or four years would make me a sailor in every\nrespect, mind and habits, as well as body–nolens volens; and would\nput all my companions so far ahead of me that college and a profession\nwould be in vain to think of; and I made up my mind that, feel as I\nmight, a sailor I must be, and to be master of a vessel, must be the\nheight of my ambition.",
        "Beside the length of the voyage, and the hard and exposed life,\nwe were at the ends of the earth; on a coast almost solitary; in a\ncountry where there is neither law nor gospel, and where sailors are\nat their captain’s mercy, there being no American consul, or any\none to whom a complaint could be made.  We lost all interest in\nthe voyage; cared nothing about the cargo, which we were only\ncollecting for others; began to patch our clothes; and felt as\nthough we were fixed beyond all hope of change.",
        "In addition to, and perhaps partly as a consequence of, this state\nof things, there was trouble brewing on board the vessel.  Our mate\n(as the first mate is always called, par excellence) was a worthy\nman;–a more honest, upright, and kind-hearted man I never saw;\nbut he was too good for the mate of a merchantman.  He was not the\nman to call a sailor a “son of a b–-h,” and knock him down with a\nhandspike.  He wanted the energy and spirit for such a voyage as ours,\nand for such a captain.  Captain T––- was a vigorous, energetic\nfellow.  As sailors say, “he hadn’t a lazy bone in him.”  He was\nmade of steel and whalebone.  He was a man to “toe the mark,\"\nand to make every one else step up to it.  During all the time that\nI was with him, I never saw him sit down on deck.  He was always\nactive and driving; severe in his discipline, and expected the same\nof his officers.  The mate not being enough of a driver for him, and\nbeing perhaps too easy with the crew, he was dissatisfied with him,\nbecame suspicious that discipline was getting relaxed, and began\nto interfere in everything.  He drew the reins taughter; and as,\nin all quarrels between officers, the sailors side with the one who\ntreats them best, he became suspicious of the crew.  He saw that\neverything went wrong–that nothing was done “with a will;” and in\nhis attempt to remedy the difficulty by severity, he made everything\nworse.  We were in every respect unfortunately situated.  Captain,\nofficers, and crew, entirely unfitted for one another; and every\ncircumstance and event was like a two-edged sword, and cut both\nways.  The length of the voyage, which made us dissatisfied, made\nthe captain, at the same time, feel the necessity of order and strict\ndiscipline; and the nature of the country, which caused us to feel that\nwe had nowhere to go for redress, but were entirely at the mercy of\na hard master, made the captain feel, on the other hand, that he\nmust depend entirely upon his own resources.  Severity created\ndiscontent, and signs of discontent provoked severity.  Then, too,\nill-treatment and dissatisfaction are no “linimenta laborum;” and many\na time have I heard the sailors say that they should not mind the\nlength of the voyage, and the hardships, if they were only kindly\ntreated, and if they could feel that something was done to make\nthings lighter and easier.  We felt as though our situation was\na call upon our superiors to give us occasional relaxations,\nand to make our yoke easier.  But the contrary policy was pursued.\nWe were kept at work all day when in port; which, together with a\nwatch at night, made us glad to turn-in as soon as we got below.\nThus we got no time for reading, or–which was of more importance\nto us–for washing and mending our clothes.  And then, when we\nwere at sea, sailing from port to port, instead of giving us\n\"watch and watch,” as was the custom on board every other vessel\non the coast, we were all kept on deck and at work, rain or\nshine, making spun-yarn and rope, and at other work in good\nweather, and picking oakum, when it was too wet for anything\nelse.  All hands were called to “come up and see it rain,” and kept\non deck hour after hour in a drenching rain, standing round the\ndeck so far apart as to prevent our talking with one another, with\nour tarpaulins and oil-cloth jackets on, picking old rope to pieces,\nor laying up gaskets and robands.  This was often done, too, when\nwe were lying in port with two anchors down, and no necessity for\nmore than one man on deck as a look-out.  This is what is called\n\"hazing” a crew, and “working their old iron up.”",
        "While lying at Santa Barbara, we encountered another south-easter;\nand, like the first, it came on in the night; the great black\nclouds coming round from the southward, covering the mountain,\nand hanging down over the town, appearing almost to rest upon\nthe roofs of the houses.  We made sail, slipped our cable, cleared\nthe point, and beat about, for four days, in the offing, under close\nsail, with continual rain and high seas and winds.  No wonder,\nthought we, they have no rain in the other seasons, for enough\nseemed to have fallen in those four days to last through a common\nsummer.  On the fifth day it cleared up, after a few hours, as is\nusual, of rain coming down like a four hours’ shower-bath, and\nwe found ourselves drifted nearly ten leagues from the anchorage;\nand having light head winds, we did not return until the sixth\nday.  Having recovered our anchor, we made preparations for getting\nunder weigh to go down to leeward.  We had hoped to go directly\nto San Diego, and thus fall in with the California before she sailed\nfor Boston; but our orders were to stop at an intermediate port\ncalled San Pedro, and as we were to lie there a week or two, and\nthe California was to sail in a few days, we lost the opportunity.\nJust before sailing, the captain took on board a short, red-haired,\nround-shouldered, vulgar-looking fellow, who had lost one eye,\nand squinted with the other, and introducing him as Mr. Russell,\ntold us that he was an officer on board.  This was too bad.  We had\nlost overboard, on the passage, one of the best of our number,\nanother had been taken from us and appointed clerk, and thus\nweakened and reduced, instead of shipping some hands to make\nour work easier, he had put another officer over us, to watch\nand drive us.  We had now four officers, and only six in the\nforecastle.  This was bringing her too much down by the stern\nfor our comfort.",
        "Leaving Santa Barbara, we coasted along down, the country\nappearing level or moderately uneven, and, for the most part, sandy\nand treeless; until, doubling a high, sandy point, we let go our\nanchor at a distance of three or three and a half miles from shore.\nIt was like a vessel, bound to Halifax, coming to anchor on the\nGrand Banks; for the shore being low, appeared to be at a greater\ndistance than it actually was, and we thought we might as well\nhave staid at Santa Barbara, and sent our boat down for the hides.\nThe land was of a clayey consistency, and, as far as the eye could\nreach, entirely bare of trees and even shrubs; and there was no\nsign of a town,–not even a house to be seen.  What brought us\ninto such a place, we could not conceive.  No sooner had we come\nto anchor, than the slip-rope, and the other preparations for\nsouth-easters, were got ready; and there was reason enough for it,\nfor we lay exposed to every wind that could blow, except the north-west,\nand that came over a flat country with a range of more than a\nleague of water.  As soon as everything was snug on board, the\nboat was lowered, and we pulled ashore, our new officer, who had\nbeen several times in the port before, taking the place of steersman.\nAs we drew in, we found the tide low, and the rocks and stones,\ncovered with kelp and sea-weed, lying bare for the distance of\nnearly an eighth of a mile.  Picking our way barefooted over these,\nwe came to what is called the landing-place, at high-water mark.\nThe soil was as it appeared at first, loose and clayey, and except\nthe stalks of the mustard plant, there was no vegetation.  Just in\nfront of the landing, and immediately over it, was a small hill,\nwhich, from its being not more than thirty or forty feet high, we had\nnot perceived from our anchorage.  Over this hill we saw three men\ncoming down, dressed partly like sailors and partly like Californians;\none of them having on a pair of untanned leather trowsers and a red\nbaize shirt.  When they came down to us, we found that they were\nEnglishmen, and they told us that they had belonged to a small\nMexican brig which had been driven ashore here in a south-easter,\nand now lived in a small house just over the hill.  Going up\nthis hill with them, we saw, just behind it, a small, low building,\nwith one room, containing a fire-place, cooking apparatus, etc., and\nthe rest of it unfinished, and used as a place to store hides and\ngoods.  This, they told us, was built by some traders in the Pueblo,\n(a town about thirty miles in the interior, to which this was the\nport,) and used by them as a storehouse, and also as a lodging place\nwhen they came down to trade with the vessels.  These three men\nwere employed by them to keep the house in order, and to look out\nfor the things stored in it.  They said that they had been there\nnearly a year; had nothing to do most of the time, living upon beef,\nhard bread, and frijoles (a peculiar kind of bean very abundant in\nCalifornia).  The nearest house, they told us, was a Rancho,\nor cattle-farm, about three miles off; and one of them went up,\nat the request of our officer, to order a horse to be sent down,\nwith which the agent, who was on board, might go up to the Pueblo.\nFrom one of them, who was an intelligent English sailor, I learned\na good deal, in a few minutes’ conversation, about the place, its\ntrade, and the news from the southern ports.  San Diego, he said,\nwas about eighty miles to the leeward of San Pedro; that they had\nheard from there, by a Mexican who came up on horseback, that\nthe California had sailed for Boston, and that the Lagoda, which\nhad been in San Pedro only a few weeks before, was taking in her\ncargo for Boston.  The Ayacucho was also there, loading for Callao,\nand the little Loriotte, which had run directly down from Monterey,\nwhere we left her.  San Diego, he told me, was a small, snug place,\nhaving very little trade, but decidedly the best harbor on the coast,\nbeing completely land-locked, and the water as smooth as a duck-pond.\nThis was the depot for all the vessels engaged in the trade; each one\nhaving a large house there, built of rough boards, in which they\nstowed their hides, as fast as they collected them in their trips\nup and down the coast, and when they had procured a full cargo,\nspent a few weeks there, taking it in, smoking ship, supplying\nwood and water, and making other preparations for the voyage home.\nThe Lagoda was now about this business.  When we should be about it,\nwas more than I could tell; two years, at least, I thought to myself.",
        "I also learned, to my surprise, that the desolate-looking place we\nwere in was the best place on the whole coast for hides.  It was the\nonly port for a distance of eighty miles, and about thirty miles in\nthe interior was a fine plane country, filled with herds of cattle,\nin the centre of which was the Pueblo de los Angelos–the largest\ntown in California–and several of the wealthiest missions; to all\nof which San Pedro was the sea-port.",
        "Having made our arrangements for a horse to take the agent to\nthe Pueblo the next day, we picked our way again over the green,\nslippery rocks, and pulled aboard.  By the time we reached the\nvessel, which was so far off that we could hardly see her, in the\nincreasing darkness, the boats were hoisted up, and the crew at\nsupper.  Going down into the forecastle, eating our supper, and\nlighting our cigars and pipes, we had, as usual, to tell all we had\nseen or heard ashore.  We all agreed that it was the worst place\nwe had seen yet, especially for getting off hides, and our lying off\nat so great a distance looked as though it was bad for south-easters.\nAfter a few disputes as to whether we should have to carry our\ngoods up the hill, or not, we talked of San Diego, the probability\nof seeing the Lagoda before she sailed, etc., etc.",
        "The next day we pulled the agent ashore, and he went up to\nvisit the Pueblo and the neighboring missions; and in a few days,\nas the result of his labors, large ox-carts, and droves of mules,\nloaded with hides, were seen coming over the flat country.\nWe loaded our long-boat with goods of all kinds, light and heavy,\nand pulled ashore.  After landing and rolling them over the stones\nupon the beach, we stopped, waiting for the carts to come down the\nhill and take them; but the captain soon settled the matter by ordering\nus to carry them all up to the top, saying that, that was “California\nfashion.” So what the oxen would not do, we were obliged to do.\nThe hill was low, but steep, and the earth, being clayey and wet\nwith the recent rains, was but bad holding-ground for our feet.\nThe heavy barrels and casks we rolled up with some difficulty,\ngetting behind and putting our shoulders to them; now and then\nour feet slipping, added to the danger of the casks rolling back\nupon us.  But the greatest trouble was with the large boxes of\nsugar.  These, we had to place upon oars, and lifting them up rest\nthe oars upon our shoulders, and creep slowly up the hill with the\ngait of a funeral procession.  After an hour or two of hard work,\nwe got them all up, and found the carts standing full of hides,\nwhich we had to unload, and also to load again with our own goods;\nthe lazy Indians, who came down with them, squatting down on their\nhams, looking on, doing nothing, and when we asked them to help us,\nonly shaking their heads, or drawling out “no quiero.”",
        "Having loaded the carts, we started up the Indians, who went\noff, one on each side of the oxen, with long sticks, sharpened at\nthe end, to punch them with.  This is one of the means of saving\nlabor in California;–two Indians to two oxen.  Now, the hides\nwere to be got down; and for this purpose, we brought the boat\nround to a place where the hill was steeper, and threw them down,\nletting them slide over the slope.  Many of them lodged, and we\nhad to let ourselves down and set them agoing again; and in this\nway got covered with dust, and our clothes torn.  After we had\ngot them all down, we were obliged to take them on our heads,\nand walk over the stones, and through the water, to the boat.\nThe water and the stones together would wear out a pair of shoes\na day, and as shoes were very scarce and very dear, we were compelled\nto go barefooted.  At night, we went on board, having had the hardest\nand most disagreeable day’s work that we had yet experienced.\nFor several days, we were employed in this manner, until we had\nlanded forty or fifty tons of goods, and brought on board about\ntwo thousand hides; when the trade began to slacken, and we were\nkept at work, on board, during the latter part of the week,\neither in the hold or upon the rigging.  On Thursday night,\nthere was a violent blow from the northward, but as this was\noff-shore, we had only to let go our other anchor and hold on.\nWe were called up at night to send down the royal-yards.  It was\nas dark as a pocket, and the vessel pitching at her anchors,\nI went up to the fore, and my friend S––-, to the main,\nand we soon had them down “ship-shape and Bristol fashion,\"\nfor, as we had now got used to our duty aloft, everything above\nthe cross-trees was left to us, who were the youngest of the crew,\nexcept one boy.",
        "For several days the captain seemed very much out of humor.\nNothing went right, or fast enough for him.  He quarrelled with\nthe cook, and threatened to flog him for throwing wood on deck;\nand had a dispute with the mate about reeving a Spanish burton;\nthe mate saying that he was right, and had been taught how to do\nit by a man who was a sailor!  This, the captain took in dudgeon,\nand they were at sword’s points at once.  But his displeasure was\nchiefly turned against a large, heavy-moulded fellow from the\nMiddle States, who was called Sam.  This man hesitated in his speech,\nand was rather slow in his motions, but was a pretty good sailor,\nand always seemed to do his best; but the captain took a dislike\nto him, thought he was surly, and lazy; and “if you once give a\ndog a bad name\"–as the sailor-phrase is–\"he may as well jump\noverboard.” The captain found fault with everything this man did,\nand hazed him for dropping a marline-spike from the main-yard,\nwhere he was at work.  This, of course, was an accident, but it\nwas set down against him.  The captain was on board all day Friday,\nand everything went on hard and disagreeably.  “The more you drive\na man, the less he will do,” was as true with us as with any\nother people.  We worked late Friday night, and were turned-to\nearly Saturday morning.  About ten o’clock the captain ordered\nour new officer, Russell, who by this time had become thoroughly\ndisliked by all the crew, to get the gig ready to take him ashore.\nJohn, the Swede, was sitting in the boat alongside, and Russell\nand myself were standing by the main hatchway, waiting for the\ncaptain, who was down in the hold, where the crew were at work,\nwhen we heard his voice raised in violent dispute with somebody,\nwhether it was with the mate, or one of the crew, I could not\ntell; and then came blows and scuffling.  I ran to the side and\nbeckoned to John, who came up, and we leaned down the hatchway;\nand though we could see no one, yet we knew that the captain had\nthe advantage, for his voice was loud and clear–",
        "“You see your condition! You see your condition! Will you ever\ngive me any more of your jaw?”  No answer; and then came\nwrestling and heaving, as though the man was trying to turn him.\n\"You may as well keep still, for I have got you,” said the captain.\nThen came the question, “Will you ever give me any more of your jaw?”",
        "“I never gave you any, sir,” said Sam; for it was his voice that\nwe heard, though low and half choked.",
        "“That’s not what I ask you.  Will you ever be impudent to me again?”",
        "“I never have been, sir,” said Sam.",
        "“Answer my question, or I’ll make a spread eagle of you! I’ll\nflog you, by G–d.”",
        "“I’m no negro slave,” said Sam.",
        "“Then I’ll make you one,” said the captain; and he came to the \nhatchway, and sprang on deck, threw off his coat, and rolling\nup his sleeves, called out to the mate–\"Seize that man up, Mr.\nA––-!  Seize him up!  Make a spread eagle of him!  I’ll teach\nyou all who is master aboard!”",
        "The crew and officers followed the captain up the hatchway,\nand after repeated orders the mate laid hold of Sam, who made\nno resistance, and carried him to the gangway.",
        "“What are you going to flog that man for, sir?” said John, the\nSwede, to the captain.",
        "Upon hearing this, the captain turned upon him, but knowing\nhim to be quick and resolute, he ordered the steward to bring the\nirons, and calling upon Russell to help him, went up to John.",
        "“Let me alone,” said John.  “I’m willing to be put in irons.  You\nneed not use any force;” and putting out his hands, the captain\nslipped the irons on, and sent him aft to the quarter-deck.  Sam by\nthis time was seized up, as it is called, that is, placed against the\nshrouds, with his wrists made fast to the shrouds, his jacket off,\nand his back exposed.  The captain stood on the break of the deck,\na few feet from him, and a little raised, so as to have a good swing\nat him, and held in his hand the bight of a thick, strong rope.\nThe officers stood round, and the crew grouped together in the waist.\nAll these preparations made me feel sick and almost faint, angry\nand excited as I was.  A man–a human being, made in God’s likeness–\nfastened up and flogged like a beast!  A man, too, whom I had lived\nwith and eaten with for months, and knew almost as well as a brother.\nThe first and almost uncontrollable impulse was resistance.  But what\nwas to be done?  The time for it had gone by.  The two best men were\nfast, and there were only two beside myself, and a small boy of\nten or twelve years of age.  And then there were (beside the\ncaptain) three officers, steward, agent and clerk.  But beside\nthe numbers, what is there for sailors to do? If they resist, it is\nmutiny; and if they succeed, and take the vessel, it is piracy.\nIf they ever yield again, their punishment must come; and if they\ndo not yield, they are pirates for life.  If a sailor resist his\ncommander, he resists the law, and piracy or submission are his\nonly alternatives.  Bad as it was, it must be borne.  It is what\na sailor ships for.  Swinging the rope over his head, and bending\nhis body so as to give it full force, the captain brought it down\nupon the poor fellow’s back.  Once, twice–six times.  “Will you\never give me any more of your jaw?”  The man writhed with pain,\nbut said not a word.  Three times more.  This was too much, and he\nmuttered something which I could not hear; this brought as many\nmore as the man could stand; when the captain ordered him to be\ncut down, and to go forward.",
        "“Now for you,” said the captain, making up to John and taking\nhis irons off.  As soon as he was loose, he ran forward to the\nforecastle.  “Bring that man aft,” shouted the captain.  The second\nmate, who had been a shipmate of John’s, stood still in the waist,\nand the mate walked slowly forward; but our third officer, anxious\nto show his zeal, sprang forward over the windlass, and laid hold\nof John; but he soon threw him from him.  At this moment I would\nhave given worlds for the power to help the poor fellow; but it\nwas all in vain.  The captain stood on the quarter-deck, bare-headed,\nhis eyes flashing with rage, and his face as red as blood, swinging\nthe rope, and calling out to his officers, “Drag him aft!–Lay hold\nof him!  I’ll sweeten him!” etc., etc.  The mate now went forward\nand told John quietly to go aft; and he, seeing resistance in vain,\nthrew the blackguard third mate from him; said he would go aft\nof himself; that they should not drag him; and went up to the\ngangway and held out his hands; but as soon as the captain began\nto make him fast, the indignity was too much, and he began to\nresist; but the mate and Russell holding him, he was soon seized\nup.  When he was made fast, he turned to the captain, who stood\nturning up his sleeves and getting ready for the blow, and asked\nhim what he was to be flogged for.  “Have I ever refused my duty,\nsir?  Have you ever known me to hang back, or to be insolent, or\nnot to know my work?”",
        "“No,” said the captain, “it is not that that I flog you for; I flog\nyou for your interference–for asking questions.”",
        "“Can’t a man ask a question here without being flogged?”",
        "“No,” shouted the captain; “nobody shall open his mouth aboard\nthis vessel, but myself;” and began laying the blows upon his back,\nswinging half round between each blow, to give it full effect.\nAs he went on, his passion increased, and he danced about the deck,\ncalling out as he swung the rope,–\"If you want to know what I\nflog you for, I’ll tell you.  It’s because I like to do it!–because\nI like to do it!–It suits me!  That’s what I do it for!”",
        "The man writhed under the pain, until he could endure it no\nlonger, when he called out, with an exclamation more common\namong foreigners than with us–\"Oh, Jesus Christ!  Oh, Jesus\nChrist!”",
        "“Don’t call on Jesus Christ,” shouted the captain; “he can’t help\nyou.  Call on Captain T––-, he’s the man!  He can help you!\nJesus Christ can’t help you now!”",
        "At these words, which I never shall forget, my blood ran cold.\nI could look on no longer.  Disgusted, sick, and horror-struck,\nI turned away and leaned over the rail, and looked down into the\nwater.  A few rapid thoughts of my own situation, and of the\nprospect of future revenge, crossed my mind; but the falling of the\nblows and the cries of the man called me back at once.  At length\nthey ceased, and turning round, I found that the mate, at a signal\nfrom the captain had cut him down.  Almost doubled up with pain,\nthe man walked slowly forward, and went down into the forecastle.\nEvery one else stood still at his post, while the captain, swelling\nwith rage and with the importance of his achievement, walked the\nquarter-deck, and at each turn, as he came forward, calling out to\nus,–\"You see your condition!  You see where I’ve got you all, and\nyou know what to expect!\"–\"You’ve been mistaken in me–you didn’t \nknow what I was!  Now you know what I am!\"–\"I’ll make you toe the\nmark, every soul of you, or I’ll flog you all, fore and aft, from the\nboy, up!\"–\"You’ve got a driver over you!  Yes, a slave-driver–\na negro-driver! I’ll see who’ll tell me he isn’t a negro slave!\"\nWith this and the like matter, equally calculated to quiet us, and to\nallay any apprehensions of future trouble, he entertained us for\nabout ten minutes, when he went below.  Soon after, John came aft,\nwith his bare back covered with stripes and wales in every direction,\nand dreadfully swollen, and asked the steward to ask the captain to\nlet him have some salve, or balsam, to put upon it.  “No,” said\nthe captain, who heard him from below; “tell him to put his shirt\non; that’s the best thing for him; and pull me ashore in the boat.\nNobody is going to lay-up on board this vessel.”  He then called to\nMr. Russell to take those men and two others in the boat, and pull\nhim ashore.  I went for one.  The two men could hardly bend their\nbacks, and the captain called to them to “give way,” “give way!” but\nfinding they did their best, he let them alone.  The agent was in\nthe stern sheets, but during the whole pull–a league or more–not\na word was spoken.  We landed; the captain, agent, and officer went\nup to the house, and left us with the boat.  I, and the man with me,\nstaid near the boat, while John and Sam walked slowly away, and sat\ndown on the rocks.  They talked some time together, but at length\nseparated, each sitting alone.  I had some fears of John.  He was\na foreigner, and violently tempered, and under suffering; and he\nhad his knife with him, and the captain was to come down alone\nto the boat.  But nothing happened; and we went quietly on board.\nThe captain was probably armed, and if either of them had lifted a\nhand against him, they would have had nothing before them but flight,\nand starvation in the woods of California, or capture by the soldiers\nand Indian blood-hounds, whom the offer of twenty dollars would\nhave set upon them.",
        "After the day’s work was done, we went down into the forecastle,\nand ate our plain supper; but not a word was spoken.  It was\nSaturday night; but there was no song–no “sweethearts and wives.\"\nA gloom was over everything.  The two men lay in their berths,\ngroaning with pain, and we all turned in, but for myself, not to\nsleep.  A sound coming now and then from the berths of the two\nmen showed that they were awake, as awake they must have been,\nfor they could hardly lie in one posture a moment; the dim,\nswinging lamp of the forecastle shed its light over the dark hole\nin which we lived; and many and various reflections and purposes\ncoursed through my mind.  I thought of our situation, living under a\ntyranny; of the character of the country we were in; of the length\nof the voyage, and of the uncertainty attending our return to\nAmerica; and then, if we should return, of the prospect of obtaining\njustice and satisfaction for these poor men; and vowed that if God\nshould ever give me the means, I would do something to redress the\ngrievances and relieve the sufferings of that poor class of beings,\nof whom I then was one.",
        "The next day was Sunday.  We worked as usual, washing decks, etc.,\nuntil breakfast-time.  After breakfast, we pulled the captain\nashore, and finding some hides there which had been brought down\nthe night before, he ordered me to stay ashore and watch them,\nsaying that the boat would come again before night.  They left me,\nand I spent a quiet day on the hill, eating dinner with the three\nmen at the little house.  Unfortunately, they had no books, and\nafter talking with them and walking about, I began to grow tired\nof doing nothing.  The little brig, the home of so much hardship\nand suffering, lay in the offing, almost as far as one could see;\nand the only other thing which broke the surface of the great bay\nwas a small, desolate-looking island, steep and conical, of a clayey\nsoil, and without the sign of vegetable life upon it; yet which had\na peculiar and melancholy interest to me, for on the top of it were\nburied the remains of an Englishman, the commander of a small merchant\nbrig, who died while lying in this port.  It was always a solemn and\ninteresting spot to me.  There it stood, desolate, and in the midst\nof desolation; and there were the remains of one who died and was\nburied alone and friendless.  Had it been a common burying-place,\nit would have been nothing.  The single body corresponded well with\nthe solitary character of everything around.  It was the only thing\nin California from which I could ever extract anything like poetry.\nThen, too, the man died far from home; without a friend near him;\nby poison, it was suspected, and no one to inquire into it; and\nwithout proper funeral rites; the mate, (as I was told,) glad to\nhave him out of the way, hurrying him up the hill and into the ground,\nwithout a word or a prayer.",
        "I looked anxiously for a boat, during the latter part of the\nafternoon, but none came; until toward sundown, when I saw a\nspeck on the water, and as it drew near, I found it was the\ngig, with the captain. The hides, then, were not to go off.\nThe captain came up the hill, with a man, bringing my monkey\njacket and a blanket.  He looked pretty black, but inquired\nwhether I had enough to eat; told me to make a house out of\nthe hides, and keep myself warm, as I should have to sleep\nthere among them, and to keep good watch over them.  I got\na moment to speak to the man who brought my jacket.",
        "“How do things go aboard?” said I.",
        "“Bad enough,” said he; “hard work and not a kind word spoken.”",
        "“What,” said I, “have you been at work all day?”",
        "“Yes! no more Sunday for us.  Everything has been moved in the\nhold, from stem to stern, and from the waterways to the keelson.”",
        "I went up to the house to supper.  We had frijoles, (the perpetual\nfood of the Californians, but which, when well cooked, are the best\nbean in the world,) coffee made of burnt wheat, and hard bread.\nAfter our meal, the three men sat down by the light of a tallow\ncandle, with a pack of greasy Spanish cards, to the favorite game\nof “treinta uno,” a sort of Spanish “everlasting.” I left them and\nwent out to take up my bivouack among the hides.  It was now dark;\nthe vessel was hidden from sight, and except the three men in the\nhouse, there was not a living soul within a league.  The coati\n(a wild animal of a nature and appearance between that of the fox\nand the wolf) set up their sharp, quick bark, and two owls, at the\nend of two distant points running out into the bay, on different\nsides of the hills where I lay, kept up their alternate, dismal notes.\nI had heard the sound before at night, but did not know what it was,\nuntil one of the men, who came down to look at my quarters, told\nme it was the owl.  Mellowed by the distance, and heard alone, at\nnight, I thought it was the most melancholy, boding sound I had\never heard.  Through nearly all the night they kept it up, answering\none another slowly, at regular intervals.  This was relieved by the\nnoisy coati, some of which came quite near to my quarters, and\nwere not very pleasant neighbors.  The next morning, before sunrise,\nthe long-boat came ashore, and the hides were taken off.",
        "We lay at San Pedro about a week, engaged in taking off hides\nand in other labors, which had now become our regular duties.\nI spent one more day on the hill, watching a quantity of hides\nand goods, and this time succeeded in finding a part of a volume\nof Scott’s Pirate, in a corner of the house; but it failed me at a\nmost interesting moment, and I betook myself to my acquaintances on\nshore, and from them learned a good deal about the customs of the\ncountry, the harbors, etc.  This, they told me, was a worse harbor\nthan Santa Barbara, for south-easters; the bearing of the headland\nbeing a point and a half more to windward, and it being so shallow\nthat the sea broke often as far out as where we lay at anchor.\nThe gale from which we slipped at Santa Barbara, had been so bad a\none here, that the whole bay, for a league out, was filled with the\nfoam of the breakers, and seas actually broke over the Dead Man’s\nisland.  The Lagoda was lying there, and slipped at the first alarm,\nand in such haste that she was obliged to leave her launch behind her\nat anchor.  The little boat rode it out for several hours, pitching at\nher anchor, and standing with her stern up almost perpendicularly.\nThe men told me that they watched her till towards night, when\nshe snapped her cable and drove up over the breakers, high and\ndry upon the beach.",
        "On board the Pilgrim, everything went on regularly, each one \ntrying to get along as smoothly as possible; but the comfort of\nthe voyage was evidently at an end.  “That is a long lane which\nhas no turning\"–-\"Every dog must have his day, and mine will\ncome by-and-by\"–and the like proverbs, were occasionally quoted;\nbut no one spoke of any probable end to the voyage, or of Boston,\nor anything of the kind; or if he did, it was only to draw out the\nperpetual, surly reply from his shipmate–\"Boston, is it? You may\nthank your stars if you ever see that place.  You had better have\nyour back sheathed, and your head coppered, and your feet shod,\nand make out your log for California for life!” or else something of\nthis kind–\"Before you get to Boston the hides will wear the hair\noff your head, and you’ll take up all your wages in clothes, and\nwon’t have enough left to buy a wig with!”",
        "The flogging was seldom if ever alluded to by us, in the forecastle.\nIf any one was inclined to talk about it, the others, with a delicacy\nwhich I hardly expected to find among them, always stopped him,\nor turned the subject.  But the behavior of the two men who were\nflogged toward one another showed a delicacy and a sense of honor,\nwhich would have been worthy of admiration in the highest walks of\nlife.  Sam knew that the other had suffered solely on his account,\nand in all his complaints, he said that if he alone had been flogged,\nit would have been nothing; but that he never could see that man\nwithout thinking what had been the means of bringing that disgrace\nupon him; and John never, by word or deed, let anything escape him\nto remind the other that it was by interfering to save his shipmate,\nthat he had suffered.",
        "Having got all our spare room filled with hides, we hove up our anchor\nand made sail for San Diego.  In no operation can the disposition of\na crew be discovered better than in getting under weigh.",
        "Where things are “done with a will,” every one is like a cat aloft:\nsails are loosed in an instant; each one lays out his strength on\nhis handspike, and the windlass goes briskly round with the loud\ncry of “Yo heave ho! Heave and pawl! Heave hearty ho!”  But with us,\nat this time, it was all dragging work.  No one went aloft beyond\nhis ordinary gait, and the chain came slowly in over the windlass.\nThe mate, between the knight-heads, exhausted all his official\nrhetoric, in calls of “Heave with a will!\"–\"Heave hearty, men!–\nheave hearty!\"–\"Heave and raise the dead!\"–\"Heave, and away!\"\netc., etc.; but it would not do.  Nobody broke his back or his\nhand-spike by his efforts.  And when the cat-tackle-fall was strung\nalong, and all hands–cook, steward, and all–laid hold, to cat the\nanchor, instead of the lively song of “Cheerily, men!” in which all\nhands join in the chorus, we pulled a long, heavy, silent pull,\nand–as sailors say a song is as good as ten men–the anchor came\nto the cat-head pretty slowly.  “Give us ’Cheerily!’” said the\nmate; but there was no “cheerily” for us, and we did without it.\nThe captain walked the quarterdeck, and said not a word.  He must\nhave seen the change, but there was nothing which he could notice\nofficially.",
        "We sailed leisurely down the coast before a light fair wind, keeping\nthe land well aboard, and saw two other missions, looking like blocks\nof white plaster, shining in the distance; one of which, situated on\nthe top of a high hill, was San Juan Campestrano, under which vessels\nsometimes come to anchor, in the summer season, and take off hides.\nThe most distant one was St. Louis Rey, which the third mate said\nwas only fifteen miles from San Diego.  At sunset on the second day,\nwe had a large and well wooded headland directly before us, behind\nwhich lay the little harbor of San Diego.  We were becalmed off this\npoint all night, but the next morning, which was Saturday, the 14th\nof March, having a good breeze, we stood round the point, and hauling\nour wind, brought the little harbor, which is rather the outlet of a\nsmall river, right before us.  Every one was anxious to get a view\nof the new place.  A chain of high hills, beginning at the point,\n(which was on our larboard hand, coming in,) protected the harbor\non the north and west, and ran off into the interior as far as the\neye could reach.  On the other sides, the land was low, and green,\nbut without trees.  The entrance is so narrow as to admit but one\nvessel at a time, the current swift, and the channel runs so near to\na low stony point that the ship’s sides appeared almost to touch it.\nThere was no town in sight, but on the smooth sand beach, abreast,\nand within a cable’s length of which three vessels lay moored,\nwere four large houses, built of rough boards, and looking like the\ngreat barns in which ice is stored on the borders of the large ponds\nnear Boston; with piles of hides standing round them, and men in\nred shirts and large straw hats, walking in and out of the doors.\nThese were the hide-houses.  Of the vessels: one, a short, clumsy,\nlittle hermaphrodite brig, we recognized as our old acquaintance,\nthe Loriotte; another, with sharp bows and raking masts, newly painted\nand tarred, and glittering in the morning sun, with the blood-red\nbanner and cross of St. George at her peak, was the handsome Ayacucho.\nThe third was a large ship, with top-gallant-masts housed, and sails\nunbent, and looking as rusty and worn as two years’ “hide-droghing” could\nmake her.  This was the Lagoda.  As we drew near, carried rapidly\nalong by the current, we overhauled our chain, and clewed up the\ntopsails.  “Let go the anchor!” said the captain but either there was\nnot chain enough forward of the windlass, or the anchor went down\nfoul, or we had too much headway on, for it did not bring us up.\n\"Pay out chain!” shouted the captain; and we gave it to her; but it\nwould not do.  Before the other anchor could be let go, we drifted\ndown, broadside on, and went smash into the Lagoda.  Her crew were\nat breakfast in the forecastle, and the cook, seeing us coming,\nrushed out of his galley, and called up the officers and men.",
        "Fortunately no great harm was done.  Her jib-boom ran between our\nfore and main masts, carrying away some of our rigging, and breaking\ndown the rail.  She lost her martingale.  This brought us up, and as\nthey paid out chain, we swung clear of them, and let go the other\nanchor; but this had as bad luck as the first, for, before any one\nperceived it, we were drifting on to the Loriotte.  The captain now\ngave out his orders rapidly and fiercely, sheeting home the topsails,\nand backing and filling the sails, in hope of starting or clearing\nthe anchors; but it was all in vain, and he sat down on the rail,\ntaking it very leisurely, and calling out to Captain Nye, that he was\ncoming to pay him a visit.  We drifted fairly into the Loriotte, her\nlarboard bow into our starboard quarter, carrying away a part of our\nstarboard quarter railing, and breaking off her larboard bumpkin,\nand one or two stanchions above the deck.  We saw our handsome\nsailor, Jackson, on the forecastle, with the Sandwich Islanders,\nworking away to get us clear.  After paying out chain, we swung\nclear, but our anchors were no doubt afoul of hers.  We manned\nthe windlass, and hove, and hove away, but to no purpose.\nSometimes we got a little upon the cable, but a good surge would take\nit all back again.  We now began to drift down toward the Ayacucho,\nwhen her boat put off and brought her commander, Captain Wilson,\non board.  He was a short, active, well-built man, between fifty\nand sixty years of age; and being nearly twenty years older than\nour captain, and a thorough seaman, he did not hesitate to give his\nadvice, and from giving advice, he gradually came to taking the\ncommand; ordering us when to heave and when to pawl, and backing\nand filling the topsails, setting and taking in jib and trysail,\nwhenever he thought best.  Our captain gave a few orders, but as\nWilson generally countermanded them, saying, in an easy, fatherly\nkind of way, “Oh no! Captain T––-, you don’t want the jib on\nher,” or “it isn’t time yet to heave!” he soon gave it up.  We had no\nobjections to this state of things, for Wilson was a kind old man,\nand had an encouraging and pleasant way of speaking to us, which\nmade everything go easily.  After two or three hours of constant\nlabor at the windlass, heaving and “Yo ho!\"-ing with all our might,\nwe brought up an anchor, with the Loriotte’s small bower fast to it,\nHaving cleared this and let it go, and cleared our hawse, we soon\ngot our other anchor, which had dragged half over the harbor.\n\"Now,” said Wilson, “I’ll find you a good berth;” and setting both\nthe topsails, he carried us down, and brought us to anchor, in\nhandsome style, directly abreast of the hide-house which we were to \nuse.  Having done this, he took his leave, while we furled the sails,\nand got our breakfast, which was welcome to us, for we had worked\nhard, and it was nearly twelve o’clock.  After breakfast, and until\nnight, we were employed in getting out the boats and mooring ship.",
        "After supper, two of us took the captain on board the Lagoda.\nAs he came alongside, he gave his name, and the mate, in the\ngangway, called out to the captain down the companion-way–\n\"Captain T––- has come aboard, sir!”  “Has he brought his brig\nwith him?” said the rough old fellow, in a tone which made itself\nheard fore and aft.  This mortified our captain a little, and it\nbecame a standing joke among us for the rest of the voyage.\nThe captain went down into the cabin, and we walked forward and\nput our heads down the forecastle, where we found the men at supper,\n\"Come down, shipmates! Come down!” said they, as soon as they\nsaw us; and we went down, and found a large, high forecastle, well\nlighted; and a crew of twelve or fourteen men, eating out of their\nkids and pans, and drinking their tea, and talking and laughing,\nall as independent and easy as so many “wood-sawyer’s clerks.\"\nThis looked like comfort and enjoyment, compared with the dark\nlittle forecastle, and scanty, discontented crew of the brig.\nIt was Saturday night; they had got through with their work for the\nweek; and being snugly moored, had nothing to do until Monday, again.\nAfter two years’ hard service, they had seen the worst, and all,\nof California;–had got their cargo nearly stowed, and expected to\nsail in a week or two, for Boston.  We spent an hour or more with\nthem, talking over California matters, until the word was passed–\n\"Pilgrims, away!” and we went back with our captain.  They were\na hardy, but intelligent crew; a little roughened, and their clothes\npatched and old, from California wear; all able seamen, and between\nthe ages of twenty and thirty-five.  They inquired about our vessel,\nthe usage, etc., and were not a little surprised at the story of\nthe flogging.  They said there were often difficulties in vessels\non the coast, and sometimes knock-downs and fightings, but they\nhad never heard before of a regular seizing-up and flogging.\n\"Spread-eagles” were a new kind of bird in California.",
        "Sunday, they said, was always given in San Diego, both at the\nhide-houses and on board the vessels, a large number usually\ngoing up to the town, on liberty.  We learned a good deal from\nthem about curing and stowing of hides, etc. and they were\nanxious to have the latest news (seven months old) from Boston.\nOne of their first inquiries was for Father Taylor, the seamen’s\npreacher in Boston.  Then followed the usual strain of conversation,\ninquiries, stories, and jokes, which, one must always hear in a ship’s\nforecastle, but which are perhaps, after all, no worse, nor, indeed,\nmore gross, than that of many well-dressed gentlemen at their clubs.",
        "The next day being Sunday, after washing and clearing\ndecks, and getting breakfast, the mate came forward with\nleave for one watch to go ashore, on liberty.  We drew lots,\nand it fell to the larboard, which I was in.  Instantly all was\npreparation.  Buckets of fresh water, (which we were allowed in\nport,) and soap, were put in use; go-ashore jackets and trowsers\ngot out and brushed; pumps, neckerchiefs, and hats overhauled;\none lending to another; so that among the whole each one got a\ngood fit-out.  A boat was called to pull the “liberty men” ashore,\nand we sat down in the stern sheets, “as big as pay passengers,\"\nand jumping ashore, set out on our walk for the town, which was\nnearly three miles off.",
        "It is a pity that some other arrangement is not made in merchant\nvessels, with regard to the liberty-day.  When in port, the crews\nare kept at work all the week, and the only day they are allowed\nfor rest or pleasure is the Sabbath; and unless they go ashore on\nthat day, they cannot go at all.  I have heard of a religious captain\nwho gave his crew liberty on Saturdays, after twelve o’clock.\nThis would be a good plan, if shipmasters would bring themselves to\ngive their crews so much time.  For young sailors especially, many\nof whom have been brought up with a regard for the sacredness of\nthe day, this strong temptation to break it, is exceedingly injurious.\nAs it is, it can hardly be expected that a crew, on a long and\nhard voyage, will refuse a few hours of freedom from toil and the\nrestraints of a vessel, and an opportunity to tread the ground and\nsee the sights of society and humanity, because it is on a Sunday.\nIt is too much like escaping from prison, or being drawn out of a\npit, on the Sabbath day.",
        "I shall never forget the delightful sensation of being in the\nopen air, with the birds singing around me, and escaped from\nthe confinement, labor, and strict rule of a vessel–of being\nonce more in my life, though only for a day, my own master.\nA sailor’s liberty is but for a day; yet while it lasts it\nis perfect.  He is under no one’s eye, and can do whatever,\nand go wherever, he pleases.  This day, for the first time,\nI may truly say, in my whole life, I felt the meaning of a term\nwhich I had often heard–the sweets of liberty.  My friend S––-\nwas with me, and turning our backs upon the vessels, we walked\nslowly along, talking of the pleasure of being our own masters,\nof the times past, and when we were free in the midst of friends,\nin America, and of the prospect of our return; and planning where\nwe would go, and what we would do, when we reached home.  It was\nwonderful how the prospect brightened, and how short and tolerable\nthe voyage appeared, when viewed in this new light.  Things looked\ndifferently from what they did when we talked them over in the little\ndark forecastle, the night after the flogging at San Pedro.  It is\nnot the least of the advantages of allowing sailors occasionally\na day of liberty, that it gives them a spring, and makes them feel\ncheerful and independent, and leads them insensibly to look on the\nbright side of everything for some time after.",
        "S––- and myself determined to keep as much together as possible,\nthough we knew that it would not do to cut our shipmates; for,\nknowing our birth and education, they were a little suspicious\nthat we would try to put on the gentleman when we got ashore,\nand would be ashamed of their company; and this won’t do with\nJack.  When the voyage is at an end, you may do as you please,\nbut so long as you belong to the same vessel, you must be a\nshipmate to him on shore, or he will not be a shipmate to you on\nboard.  Being forewarned of this before I went to sea, I took no\n\"long togs” with me, and being dressed like the rest, in white duck\ntrowsers, blue jacket and straw hat, which would prevent my going\nin better company, and showing no disposition to avoid them, I set\nall suspicion at rest.  Our crew fell in with some who belonged\nto the other vessels, and, sailor-like, steered for the first\ngrog-shop.  This was a small mud building, of only one room, in\nwhich were liquors, dry and West India goods, shoes, bread, fruits,\nand everything which is vendible in California.  It was kept by\na yankee, a one-eyed man, who belonged formerly to Fall River,\ncame out to the Pacific in a whale-ship, left her at the Sandwich\nIslands, and came to California and set up a “Pulperia.”  S––- and\nI followed in our shipmates’ wake, knowing that to refuse to drink\nwith them would be the highest affront, but determining to slip\naway at the first opportunity.  It is the universal custom with sailors\nfor each one, in his turn, to treat the whole, calling for a glass all\nround, and obliging every one who is present, even the keeper of\nthe shop, to take a glass with him.  When we first came in, there\nwas some dispute between our crew and the others, whether the\nnew comers or the old California rangers should treat first; but it\nbeing settled in favor of the latter, each of the crews of the other\nvessels treated all round in their turn, and as there were a good\nmany present, (including some “loafers” who had dropped in, knowing\nwhat was going on, to take advantage of Jack’s hospitality,)\nand the liquor was a real (12½ cents) a glass, it made somewhat\nof a hole in their lockers.  It was now our ship’s turn, and S––-\nand I, anxious to get away, stepped up to call for glasses; but we\nsoon found that we must go in order–the oldest first, for the old\nsailors did not choose to be preceded by a couple of youngsters;\nand bon gré mal gré, we had to wait our turn, with the twofold\napprehension of being too late for our horses, and of getting\ncorned; for drink you must, every time; and if you drink with\none and not with another, it is always taken as an insult.",
        "Having at length gone through our turns and acquitted ourselves\nof all obligations, we slipped out, and went about among the\nhouses, endeavoring to get horses for the day, so that we might\nride round and see the country.  At first we had but little success,\nall that we could get out of the lazy fellows, in reply to our\nquestions, being the eternal drawling “Quien sabe?” (\"who knows?”)\nwhich is an answer to all questions.  After several efforts,\nwe at length fell in with a little Sandwich Island boy, who belonged\nto Captain Wilson of the Ayacucho, and was well acquainted in\nthe place; and he, knowing where to go, soon procured us two\nhorses, ready saddled and bridled, each with a lasso coiled over\nthe pommel.  These we were to have all day, with the privilege of\nriding them down to the beach at night, for a dollar, which we had\nto pay in advance.  Horses are the cheapest thing in California;\nthe very best not being worth more than ten dollars apiece, and very\ngood ones being often sold for three, and four.  In taking a day’s\nride, you pay for the use of the saddle, and for the labor and\ntrouble of catching the horses.  If you bring the saddle back safe,\nthey care but little what becomes of the horse.  Mounted on our\nhorses, which were spirited beasts, and which, by the way, in this\ncountry, are always steered by pressing the contrary rein against\nthe neck, and not by pulling on the bit,–we started off on a fine\nrun over the country.  The first place we went to was the old\nruinous presidio, which stands on a rising ground near the village,\nwhich it overlooks.  It is built in the form of an open square,\nlike all the other presidios, and was in a most ruinous state,\nwith the exception of one side, in which the commandant lived,\nwith his family.  There were only two guns, one of which was spiked,\nand the other had no carriage.  Twelve, half clothed, and half starved\nlooking fellows, composed the garrison; and they, it was said, had\nnot a musket apiece.  The small settlement lay directly below the\nfort, composed of about forty dark brown looking huts, or houses,\nand two larger ones, plastered, which belonged to two of the “gente\nde razón.”  This town is not more than half as large as Monterey,\nor Santa Barbara, and has little or no business.  From the presidio,\nwe rode off in the direction of the mission, which we were told was\nthree miles distant.  The country was rather sandy, and there was\nnothing for miles which could be called a tree, but the grass grew\ngreen and rank, and there were many bushes and thickets, and the\nsoil is said to be good.  After a pleasant ride of a couple of miles,\nwe saw the white walls of the mission, and fording a small river,\nwe came directly before it.  The mission is built of mud, or rather\nof the unburnt bricks of the country, and plastered.  There was\nsomething decidedly striking in its appearance: a number of irregular\nbuildings, connected with one another, and disposed in the form of\na hollow square, with a church at one end, rising above the rest,\nwith a tower containing five belfries, in each of which hung a large\nbell, and with immense rusty iron crosses at the tops.  Just outside\nof the buildings, and under the walls, stood twenty or thirty small\nhuts, built of straw and of the branches of trees, grouped together,\nin which a few Indians lived, under the protection and in the service\nof the mission.",
        "Entering a gate-way, we drove into the open square, in which the\nstillness of death reigned.  On one side was the church; on another,\na range of high buildings with grated windows; a third was a range\nof smaller buildings, or offices; and the fourth seemed to be little\nmore than a high connecting wall.  Not a living creature could we\nsee.  We rode twice round the square, in the hope of waking up\nsome one; and in one circuit, saw a tall monk, with shaven head,\nsandals, and the dress of the Grey Friars, pass rapidly through a\ngallery, but he disappeared without noticing us.  After two circuits,\nwe stopped our horses, and saw, at last, a man show himself in\nfront of one of the small buildings.  We rode up to him, and found\nhim dressed in the common dress of the country, with a silver\nchain round his neck, supporting a large bunch of keys.  From this,\nwe took him to be the steward of the mission, and addressing him\nas “Mayordomo,” received a low bow and an invitation to walk\ninto his room.  Making our horses fast, we went in.  It was a plain\nroom, containing a table, three or four chairs, a small picture or\ntwo of some saint, or miracle, or martyrdom, and a few dishes and\nglasses.  “Hay algunas cosa de comer?” said I.  “Si Señor!” said he.\n\"Que gusta usted?”  Mentioning frijoles, which I knew they must\nhave if they had nothing else, and beef and bread, and a hint for\nwine, if they had any, he went off to another building, across the\ncourt, and returned in a few moments, with a couple of Indian boys,\nbearing dishes and a decanter of wine.  The dishes contained baked\nmeats, frijoles stewed with peppers and onions, boiled eggs, and\nCalifornia flour baked into a kind of macaroni.  These, together\nwith the wine, made the most sumptuous meal we had eaten since we\nleft Boston; and, compared with the fare we had lived upon for\nseven months, it was a regal banquet.  After despatching our meal,\nwe took out some money and asked him how much we were to pay.\nHe shook his head, and crossed himself, saying that it was charity:\n–that the Lord gave it to us.  Knowing the amount of this to be\nthat he did not sell it, but was willing to receive a present,\nwe gave him ten or twelve reals, which he pocketed with admirable\nnonchalance, saying, “Dios se lo pague.”  Taking leave of him,\nwe rode out to the Indians’ huts.  The little children were\nrunning about among the huts, stark naked, and the men were not\nmuch better; but the women had generally coarse gowns, of a sort of\ntow cloth.  The men are employed, most of the time, in tending the\ncattle of the mission, and in working in the garden, which is a very\nlarge one, including several acres, and filled, it is said, with the\nbest fruits of the climate.  The language of these people, which is\nspoken by all the Indians of California, is the most brutish and\ninhuman language, without any exception, that I ever heard, or that\ncould well be conceived of.  It is a complete slabber.  The words\nfall off of the ends of their tongues, and a continual slabbering sound\nis made in the cheeks, outside of the teeth.  It cannot have been\nthe language of Montezuma and the independent Mexicans.",
        "Here, among the huts, we saw the oldest man that I had ever seen;\nand, indeed, I never supposed that a person could retain life and\nexhibit such marks of age.  He was sitting out in the sun, leaning\nagainst the side of a hut; and his legs and arms, which were bare,\nwere of a dark red color, the skin withered and shrunk up like\nburnt leather, and the limbs not larger round than those of a boy\nof five years.  He had a few grey hairs, which were tied together\nat the back of his head; and he was so feeble that, when we came\nup to him, he raised his hands slowly to his face, and taking hold\nof his lids with his fingers, lifted them up to look at us;\nand being satisfied, let them drop again.  All command over the\nlid seemed to have gone.  I asked his age, but could get no answer\nbut “Quien sabe?” and they probably did not know the age.",
        "Leaving the mission, we returned to village, going nearly all the\nway on a full run.  The California horses have no medium gait,\nwhich is pleasant, between walking and running; for as there are\nno streets and parades, they have no need of the genteel trot,\nand their riders usually keep them at the top of their speed until\nthey are fired, and then let them rest themselves by walking.\nThe fine air of the afternoon; the rapid rate of the animals,\nwho seemed almost to fly over the ground; and the excitement and\nnovelty of the motion to us, who had been so long confined on\nshipboard, were exhilarating beyond expression, and we felt willing\nto ride all day long.  Coming into the village, we found things\nlooking very lively.  The Indians, who always have a holyday on\nSunday, were engaged at playing a kind of running game of ball,\non a level piece of ground, near the houses.  The old ones sat\ndown in a ring, looking on, while the young ones–men, boys and\ngirls–were chasing the ball, and throwing it with all their\nmight.  Some of the girls ran like greyhounds.  At every accident,\nor remarkable feat, the old people set up a deafening screaming\nand clapping of hands.  Several blue jackets were reeling about\namong the houses, which showed that the pulperias had been well\npatronized.  One or two of the sailors had got on horseback,\nbut being rather indifferent horsemen, and the Spaniards having\ngiven them vicious horses, they were soon thrown, much to the\namusement of the people.  A half dozen Sandwich Islanders,\nfrom the hide-houses and the two brigs, who are bold riders,\nwere dashing about on the full gallop, hallooing and laughing\nlike so many wild men.",
        "It was now nearly sundown, and S––- and myself went into a\nhouse and sat quietly down to rest ourselves before going down to\nthe beach.  Several people were soon collected to see “los Ingles\nmarineros,” and one of them–a young woman–took a great fancy to\nmy pocket handkerchief, which was a large silk one that I had\nbefore going to sea, and a handsomer one than they had been in\nthe habit of seeing.  Of course, I gave it to her; which brought\nus into high favor; and we had a present of some pears and other\nfruits, which we took down to the beach with us.  When we came\nto leave the house, we found that our horses, which we left tied\nat the door, were both gone.  We had paid for them to ride down\nto the beach, but they were not to be found.  We went to the man\nof whom we hired them, but he only shrugged his shoulders, and\nto our question, “Where are the horses?” only answered–\"Quien\nsabe?” but as he was very easy, and made no inquiries for the\nsaddles, we saw that he knew very well where they were.  After a\nlittle trouble, determined not to walk down,–a distance of three\nmiles–we procured two, at four reals apiece, with an Indian boy\nto run on behind and bring them back.  Determined to have “the go\"\nout of the horses, for our trouble, we went down at full speed,\nand were on the beach in fifteen minutes.  Wishing to make our\nliberty last as long as possible, we rode up and down among the\nhide-houses, amusing ourselves with seeing the men, as they came\ndown, (it was now dusk,) some on horseback and others on foot.\nThe Sandwich Islanders rode down, and were in “high snuff.\"\nWe inquired for our shipmates, and were told that two of them\nhad started on horseback and had been thrown or had fallen off,\nand were seen heading for the beach, but steering pretty wild,\nand by the looks of things, would not be down much before midnight.",
        "The Indian boys having arrived, we gave them our horses, and\nhaving seen them safely off, hailed for a boat and went aboard.\nThus ended our first liberty-day on shore.  We were well tired,\nbut had had a good time, and were more willing to go back to our\nold duties.  About midnight, we were waked up by our two watchmates,\nwho had come aboard in high dispute.  It seems they had started to\ncome down on the same horse, double-backed; and each was accusing\nthe other of being the cause of his fall.  They soon, however,\nturned-in and fell asleep, and probably forgot all about it,\nfor the next morning the dispute was not renewed.",
        "The next sound we heard was “All hands ahoy!” and looking up the\nscuttle, saw that it was just daylight.  Our liberty had now truly\ntaken flight, and with it we laid away our pumps, stockings,\nblue jackets, neckerchiefs, and other go-ashore paraphernalia,\nand putting on old duck trowsers, red shirts, and Scotch caps,\nbegan taking out and landing our hides.  For three days we were\nhard at work, from the grey of the morning until starlight,\nwith the exception of a short time allowed for meals, in this duty.\nFor landing and taking on board hides, San Diego is decidedly the\nbest place in California.  The harbor is small and land-locked;\nthere is no surf; the vessels lie within a cable’s length of\nthe beach; and the beach itself is smooth, hard sand, without rocks\nor stones.  For these reasons, it is used by all the vessels in the trade,\nas a depot; and, indeed, it would be impossible, when loading with\nthe cured hides for the passage home, to take them on board at any\nof the open ports, without getting them wet in the surf, which\nwould spoil them.  We took possession of one of the hide-houses,\nwhich belonged to our firm, and had been used by the California.\nIt was built to hold forty thousand hides, and we had the pleasing\nprospect of filling it before we could leave the coast; and toward\nthis, our thirty-five hundred, which we brought down with us,\nwould do but little.  There was not a man on board who did not\ngo a dozen times into the house, and look round, and make some\ncalculation of the time it would require.",
        "The hides, as they come rough and uncured from the vessels, are\npiled up outside of the houses, whence they are taken and carried\nthrough a regular process of pickling, drying, cleaning, etc., and\nstowed away in the house, ready to be put on board.  This process\nis necessary in order that they may keep, during a long voyage, and\nin warm latitudes.  For the purpose of curing and taking care of\nthese hides, an officer and a part of the crew of each vessel are\nusually left ashore and it was for this business, we found, that our\nnew officer had joined us.  As soon as the hides were landed, he\ntook charge of the house, and the captain intended to leave two or\nthree of us with him, hiring Sandwich Islanders to take our places\non board; but he could not get any Sandwich Islanders to go,\nthough he offered them fifteen dollars a month; for the report of\nthe flogging had got among them, and he was called “aole maikai,\"\n(no good,) and that was an end of the business.  They were, however,\nwilling to work on shore, and four of them were hired and put with\nMr. Russell to cure the hides.",
        "After landing our hides, we next sent ashore all our spare spars\nand rigging; all the stores which we did not want to use in the\ncourse of one trip to windward; and, in fact, everything which we\ncould spare, so as to make room for hides: among other things,\nthe pig-sty, and with it “old Bess.”  This was an old sow that we\nhad brought from Boston, and which lived to get around Cape Horn,\nwhere all the other pigs died from cold and wet.  Report said\nthat she had been a Canton voyage before.  She had been the\npet of the cook during the whole passage, and he had fed her with\nthe best of everything, and taught her to know his voice, and to\ndo a number of strange tricks for his amusement.  Tom Cringle\nsays that no one can fathom a negro’s affection for a pig; and I\nbelieve he is right, for it almost broke our poor darky’s heart when\nhe heard that Bess was to be taken ashore, and that he was to have\nthe care of her no more during the whole voyage.  He had depended\nupon her as a solace, during the long trips up and down the coast.\n\"Obey orders, if you break owners!” said he.  “Break hearts,” he\nmeant to have said; and lent a hand to get her over the side,\ntrying to make it as easy for her as possible.  We got a whip up on\nthe main-yard, and hooking it to a strap around her body, swayed\naway; and giving a wink to one another, ran her chock up to the\nyard.  “’Vast there! ’vast!” said the mate; “none of your skylarking!\nLower away!” But he evidently enjoyed the joke.  The pig squealed\nlike the “crack of doom,” and tears stood in the poor darky’s eyes;\nand he muttered something about having no pity on a dumb beast.\n\"Dumb beast!” said Jack; “if she’s what you call a dumb beast,\nthen my eyes a’n’t mates.”  This produced a laugh from all but\nthe cook.  He was too intent upon seeing her safe in the boat.\nHe watched her all the way ashore, where, upon her landing, she was\nreceived by a whole troop of her kind, who had been sent ashore from\nthe other vessels, and had multiplied and formed a large commonwealth.\nFrom the door of his galley, the cook used to watch them in their\nmanoeuvres, setting up a shout and clapping his hands whenever Bess\ncame off victorious in the struggles for pieces of raw hide and\nhalf-picked bones which were lying about the beach.  During the day,\nhe saved all the nice things, and made a bucket of swill, and asked\nus to take it ashore in the gig, and looked quite disconcerted when\nthe mate told him that he would pitch the swill overboard, and him\nafter it, if he saw any of it go into the boats.  We told him that\nhe thought more about the pig than he did about his wife, who lived\ndown in Robinson’s Alley; and, indeed, he could hardly have been\nmore attentive, for he actually, on several nights, after dark,\nwhen he thought he would not he seen, sculled himself ashore in a\nboat with a bucket of nice swill, and returned like Leander from\ncrossing the Hellespont.",
        "The next Sunday the other half of our crew went ashore on liberty,\nand left us on board, to enjoy the first quiet Sunday which we\nhad had upon the coast.  Here were no hides to come off, and no\nsouth-easters to fear.  We washed and mended our clothes in the morning,\nand spent the rest of the day in reading and writing.  Several of us\nwrote letters to send home by the Lagoda.  At twelve o’clock the\nAyacucho dropped her fore topsail, which was a signal for her\nsailing.  She unmoored and warped down into the bight, from which\nshe got under way.  During this operation, her crew were a long\ntime heaving at the windlass, and I listened for nearly an hour to\nthe musical notes of a Sandwich Islander, called Mahannah, who\n\"sang out” for them.  Sailors, when heaving at a windlass, in order\nthat they may heave together, always have one to sing out; which is\ndone in a peculiar, high and long-drawn note, varying with the\nmotion of the windlass.  This requires a high voice, strong lungs,\nand much practice, to be done well.  This fellow had a very peculiar,\nwild sort of note, breaking occasionally into a falsetto.  The sailors\nthought it was too high, and not enough of the boatswain hoarseness\nabout it; but to me it had a great charm.  The harbor was perfectly\nstill, and his voice rang among the hills, as though it could have\nbeen heard for miles.  Toward sundown, a good breeze having\nsprung up, she got under weigh, and with her long, sharp head\ncutting elegantly through the water, on a taught bowline, she\nstood directly out of the harbor, and bore away to the southward.\nShe was bound to Callao, and thence to the Sandwich Islands,\nand expected to be on the coast again in eight or ten months.",
        "At the close of the week we were ready to sail, but were delayed\na day or two by the running away of F––-, the man who had\nbeen our second mate, and was turned forward.  From the time\nthat he was “broken,” he had had a dog’s berth on board the\nvessel, and determined to run away at the first opportunity.\nHaving shipped for an officer when he was not half a seaman,\nhe found little pity with the crew, and was not man enough to\nhold his ground among them.  The captain called him a “soger,\"(1)",
        "–––––––––––––––\n1. Soger (soldier) is the worst term of reproach that can be applied\n   to a sailor.  It signifies a skulk, a sherk,–one who is always\n   trying to get clear of work, and is out of the way, or hanging back,\n   when duty is to be done.  “Marine” is the term applied more\n   particularly to a man who is ignorant and clumsy about seaman’s work\n   –a green-horn–a land-lubber.  To make a sailor shoulder a handspike,\n   and walk fore and aft the deck, like a sentry, is the most ignominious\n   punishment that could be put upon him.  Such a punishment inflicted\n   upon an able seaman in a vessel of war, would break his spirit down\n   more than a flogging.\n–––––––––––––––",
        "and promised to “ride him down as he would the main tack;” and when\nofficers are once determined to “ride a man down,” it is a gone\ncase with him.  He had had several difficulties with the captain,\nand asked leave to go home in the Lagoda; but this was refused him.\nOne night he was insolent to an officer on the beach, and refused\nto come aboard in the boat.  He was reported to the captain; and\nas he came aboard,–it being past the proper hour,–he was called\naft, and told that he was to have a flogging.  Immediately, he fell\ndown on the deck, calling out–\"Don’t flog me, Captain T––-;\ndon’t flog me!” and the captain, angry with him, and disgusted\nwith his cowardice, gave him a few blows over the back with a\nrope’s end and sent him forward.  He was not much hurt, but a\ngood deal frightened, and made up his mind to run away that\nvery night.  This was managed better than anything he ever did\nin his life, and seemed really to show some spirit and forethought.\nHe gave his bedding and mattress to one of the Lagoda’s crew,\nwho took it aboard his vessel as something which he had bought,\nand promised to keep it for him.  He then unpacked his chest,\nputting all his valuable clothes into a large canvas bag, and told\none of us, who had the watch, to call him at midnight.  Coming on\ndeck, at midnight, and finding no officer on deck, and all still\naft, he lowered his bag into a boat, got softly down into it,\ncast off the painter, and let it drop silently with the tide\nuntil he was out of hearing, when he sculled ashore.",
        "The next morning, when all hands were mustered, there was a\ngreat stir to find F––-.  Of course, we would tell nothing, and all\nthey could discover was, that he had left an empty chest behind him,\nand that he went off in a boat; for they saw it lying up high and dry\non the beach.  After breakfast, the captain went up to the town,\nand offered a reward of twenty dollars for him; and for a couple\nof days, the soldiers, Indians, and all others who had nothing to do,\nwere scouring the country for him, on horseback, but without effect;\nfor he was safely concealed, all the time, within fifty rods of\nthe hide-houses.  As soon as he had landed, he went directly to\nthe Lagoda’s hide-house, and a part of her crew, who were living\nthere on shore, promised to conceal him and his traps until the\nPilgrim should sail, and then to intercede with Captain Bradshaw\nto take him on board the ship.  Just behind the hide-houses,\namong the thickets and underwood, was a small cave, the entrance\nto which was known only to two men on the beach, and which was so\nwell concealed that, though, when I afterwards came to live on\nshore, it was shown to me two or three times, I was never able to\nfind it alone.  To this cave he was carried before daybreak in the\nmorning, and supplied with bread and water, and there remained\nuntil he saw us under weigh and well round the point.",
        "Friday, March 27th.  The captain, having given up all hope of\nfinding F––-, and being unwilling to delay any longer, gave\norders for unmooring the ship, and we made sail, dropping slowly\ndown with the tide and light wind.  We left letters with Captain\nBradshaw to take to Boston, and had the satisfaction of hearing\nhim say that he should be back again before we left the coast.\nThe wind, which was very light, died away soon after we doubled the\npoint, and we lay becalmed for two days, not moving three miles the\nwhole time, and a part of the second day were almost within sight\nof the vessels.  On the third day, about noon, a cool sea-breeze came\nrippling and darkening the surface of the water, and by sundown\nwe were off San Juan’s, which is about forty miles from San Diego,\nand is called half way to San Pedro, where we were now bound.\nOur crew was now considerably weakened.  One man we had lost\noverboard; another had been taken aft as clerk; and a third had\nrun away; so that, beside S––- and myself, there were only three\nable seamen and one boy of twelve years of age.  With this\ndiminished and discontented crew, and in a small vessel, we were\nnow to battle the watch through a couple of years of hard service;\nyet there was not one who was not glad that F––- had escaped;\nfor, shiftless and good for nothing as he was, no one could wish\nto see him dragging on a miserable life, cowed down and disheartened;\nand we were all rejoiced to hear, upon our return to San Diego,\nabout two months afterwards, that he had been immediately taken\naboard the Lagoda, and went home in her, on regular seaman’s wages.",
        "After a slow passage of five days, we arrived, on Wednesday,\nthe first of April, at our old anchoring ground at San Pedro.\nThe bay was as deserted, and looked as dreary, as before, and formed\nno pleasing contrast with the security and snugness of San Diego,\nand the activity and interest which the loading and unloading of four\nvessels gave to that scene.  In a few days the hides began to come\nslowly down, and we got into the old business of rolling goods up\nthe hill, pitching hides down, and pulling our long league off and\non.  Nothing of note occurred while we were lying here, except\nthat an attempt was made to repair the small Mexican brig which\nhad been cast away in a south-easter, and which now lay up, high\nand dry, over one reef of rocks and two sand-banks.  Our carpenter\nsurveyed her, and pronounced her capable of refitting, and in a\nfew days the owners came down from the Pueblo, and, waiting for\nthe high spring tides, with the help of our cables, kedges, and crew,\ngot her off and afloat, after several trials.  The three men at the\nhouse on shore, who had formerly been a part of her crew, now\njoined her, and seemed glad enough at the prospect of getting off\nthe coast.",
        "On board our own vessel, things went on in the common monotonous\nway. The excitement which immediately followed the flogging scene\nhad passed off, but the effect of it upon the crew, and especially\nupon the two men themselves, remained.  The different manner in\nwhich these men were affected, corresponding to their different\ncharacters, was not a little remarkable.  John was a foreigner\nand high-tempered, and, though mortified, as any one would be at\nhaving had the worst of an encounter, yet his chief feeling seemed\nto be anger; and he talked much of satisfaction and revenge, if he\never got back to Boston.  But with the other, it was very different.\nHe was an American, and had had some education; and this thing coming\nupon him, seemed completely to break him down.  He had a feeling\nof the degradation that had been inflicted upon him, which the\nother man was incapable of.  Before that, he had a good deal of\nfun, and mused us often with queer negro stories,–(he was from\na slave state); but afterwards he seldom smiled; seemed to lose\nall life and elasticity; and appeared to have but one wish,\nand that was for the voyage to be at an end.  I have often known\nhim to draw a long sigh when he was alone, and he took but little\npart or interest in John’s plans of satisfaction and retaliation.",
        "After a stay of about a fortnight, during which we slipped for\none south-easter, and were at sea two days, we got under weigh for\nSanta Barbara.  It was now the middle of April, and the south-easter\nseason was nearly over; and the light, regular trade-winds, which blow\ndown the coast, began to set steadily in, during the latter part of\neach day.  Against these, we beat slowly up to Santa Barbara–a\ndistance of about ninety miles–in three days.  There we found,\nlying at anchor, the large Genoese ship which we saw in the same\nplace, on the first day of our coming upon the coast.  She had been\nup to San Francisco, or, as it is called, “chock up to windward,\"\nhad stopped at Monterey on her way down, and was shortly to proceed\nto San Pedro and San Diego, and thence, taking in her cargo, to sail\nfor Valparaiso and Cadiz.  She was a large, clumsy ship, and with\nher topmasts stayed forward, and high poop-deck, looked like an\nold woman with a crippled back.  It was now the close of Lent,\nand on Good Friday she had all her yards a’cock-bill, which is\ncustomary among Catholic vessels.  Some also have an effigy of\nJudas, which the crew amuse themselves with keel-hauling and\nhanging by the neck from the yard-arms.",
        "The next Sunday was Easter Sunday, and as there had been no\nliberty at San Pedro, it was our turn to go ashore and misspend\nanother Sabbath.  Soon after breakfast, a large boat, filled with\nmen in blue jackets, scarlet caps, and various colored under-clothes,\nbound ashore on liberty, left the Italian ship, and passed under\nour stern; the men singing beautiful Italian boat-songs, all the way,\nin fine, full chorus.  Among the songs I recognized the favorite\n\"O Pescator dell’ onda.”  It brought back to my mind pianofortes,\ndrawing-rooms, young ladies singing, and a thousand other things\nwhich as little befitted me, in my situation, to be thinking upon.\nSupposing that the whole day would be too long a time to spend\nashore, as there was no place to which we could take a ride,\nwe remained quietly on board until after dinner.  We were then\npulled ashore in the stern of the boat, and, with orders to be on\nthe beach at sundown, we took our way for the town.  There,\neverything wore the appearance of a holyday.  The people were\nall dressed in their best; the men riding about on horseback among\nthe houses, and the women sitting on carpets before the doors.\nUnder the piazza of a “pulperia,” two men were seated, decked out\nwith knots of ribbons and bouquets, and playing the violin and\nthe Spanish guitar.  These are the only instruments, with the\nexception of the drums and trumpets at Monterey that I ever heard in\nCalifornia; and I suspect they play upon no others, for at a great\nfandango at which I was afterwards present, and where they mustered\nall the music they could find, there were three violins and two\nguitars, and no other instrument.  As it was now too near the middle\nof the day to see any dancing and hearing that a bull was expected\ndown from the country, to be baited in the presidio square, in the\ncourse of an hour or two we took a stroll among the houses.\nInquiring for an American who, we had been told, had married in the\nplace, and kept a shop, we were directed to a long, low building,\nat the end of which was a door, with a sign over it, in Spanish.\nEntering the shop, we found no one in it, and the whole had an\nempty, deserted appearance.  In a few minutes the man made his\nappearance, and apologized for having nothing to entertain us with,\nsaying that he had had a fandango at his house the night before,\nand the people had eaten and drunk up everything.",
        "“Oh yes!” said I, “Easter holydays?”",
        "“No!” said he, with a singular expression to his face; “I had a\nlittle daughter die the other day, and that’s the custom of the\ncountry.”",
        "Here I felt a little strangely, not knowing what to say, or whether\nto offer consolation or no, and was beginning to retire, when he\nopened a side door and told us to walk in.  Here I was no less\nastonished; for I found a large room, filled with young girls,\nfrom three or four years of age up to fifteen and sixteen, dressed\nall in white, with wreaths of flowers on their heads, and bouquets\nin their hands.  Following our conductor through all these girls,\nwho were playing about in high spirits, we came to a table, at the\nend of the room, covered with a white cloth, on which lay a coffin,\nabout three feet long, with the body of his child.  The coffin was\nlined on the outside with white cloth, and on the inside with white\nsatin, and was strewed with flowers.  Through an open door we saw,\nin another room, a few elderly people in common dresses; while\nthe benches and tables thrown up in a corner, and the stained walls,\ngave evident signs of the last night’s “high go.”  Feeling, like\nGarrick, between tragedy and comedy, an uncertainty of purpose\nand a little awkwardness, I asked the man when the funeral would\ntake place, and being told that it would move toward the mission\nin about an hour, took my leave.",
        "To pass away the time, we took horses and rode down to the\nbeach, and there found three or four Italian sailors, mounted, and\nriding up and down, on the hard sand, at a furious rate.  We joined\nthem, and found it fine sport.  The beach gave us a stretch of a mile\nor more, and the horses flew over the smooth, hard sand, apparently\ninvigorated and excited by the salt sea-breeze, and by the continual\nroar and dashing of the breakers.  From the beach we returned to\nthe town, and finding that the funeral procession had moved, rode\non and overtook it, about half-way to the mission.  Here was as\npeculiar a sight as we had seen before in the house; the one looking\nas much like a funeral procession as the other did like a house of\nmourning.  The little coffin was borne by eight girls, who were\ncontinually relieved by others, running forward from the procession\nand taking their places.  Behind it came a straggling company of\ngirls, dressed as before, in white and flowers, and including, I should\nsuppose by their numbers, nearly all the girls between five and fifteen\nin the place.  They played along on the way, frequently stopping\nand running all together to talk to some one, or to pick up a flower,\nand then running on again to overtake the coffin.  There were a few\nelderly women in common colors; and a herd of young men and boys,\nsome on foot and others mounted, followed them, or walked or rode\nby their side, frequently interrupting them by jokes and questions.\nBut the most singular thing of all was, that two men walked,\none on each side of the coffin, carrying muskets in their hands,\nwhich they continually loaded, and fired into the air.  Whether\nthis was to keep off the evil spirits or not, I do not know.\nIt was the only interpretation that I could put upon it.",
        "As we drew near the mission, we saw the great gate thrown open,\nand the pádre standing on the steps, with a crucifix in hand.\nThe mission is a large and deserted-looking place, the out-buildings\ngoing to ruin, and everything giving one the impression of decayed\ngrandeur.  A large stone fountain threw out pure water, from four\nmouths, into a basin, before the church door; and we were on the\npoint of riding up to let our horses drink, when it occurred to us\nthat it might be consecrated, and we forbore.  Just at this moment,\nthe bells set up their harsh, discordant clang; and the procession\nmoved into the court.  I was anxious to follow, and see the ceremony,\nbut the horse of one of my companions had become frightened, and\nwas tearing off toward the town; and having thrown his rider, and\ngot one of his feet caught in the saddle, which had slipped, was fast\ndragging and ripping it to pieces.  Knowing that my shipmate\ncould not speak a word of Spanish, and fearing that he would get\ninto difficulty, I was obliged to leave the ceremony and ride after\nhim.  I soon overtook him, trudging along, swearing at the horse,\nand carrying the remains of the saddle, which he had picked up\non the road.  Going to the owner of the horse, we made a settlement\nwith him, and found him surprisingly liberal.  All parts of\nthe saddle were brought back, and, being capable of repair, he was\nsatisfied with six reáls.  We thought it would have been a few\ndollars.  We pointed to the horse, which was now half way up one\nof the mountains; but he shook his head, saying, “No importe!\"\nand giving us to understand that he had plenty more.",
        "Having returned to the town, we saw a great crowd collected in\nthe square before the principal pulperia, and riding up, found that\nall these people–men, women, and children–had been drawn together\nby a couple of bantam cocks.  The cocks were in full tilt,\nspringing into one another, and the people were as eager, laughing\nand shouting, as though the combatants had been men.  There had\nbeen a disappointment about the bull; he had broken his bail, and\ntaken himself off, and it was too late to get another; so the people\nwere obliged to put up with a cock-fight.  One of the bantams having\nbeen knocked in the head, and had an eye put out, he gave in, and\ntwo monstrous prize-cocks were brought on.  These were the object\nof the whole affair; the two bantams having been merely served up\nas a first course, to collect the people together.  Two fellows came\ninto the ring holding the cocks in their arms, and stroking them,\nand running about on all fours, encouraging and setting them on.\nBets ran high, and, like most other contests, it remained for some\ntime undecided.  They both showed great pluck, and fought probably\nbetter and longer than their masters would have done.  Whether,\nin the end, it was the white or the red that beat, I do not recollect;\nbut, whichever it was, he strutted off with the true veni-vidi-vici look,\nleaving the other lying panting on his beam-ends.",
        "This matter having been settled, we heard some talk about “caballos\"\nand “carrera” and seeing the people all streaming off in one direction,\nwe followed, and came upon a level piece of ground, just out of\nthe town, which was used as a race-course.  Here the crowd soon\nbecame thick again; the ground was marked off; the judges stationed;\nand the horses led up to one end.  Two fine-looking old gentlemen\n–Don Carlos and Don Domingo, so called–held the stakes, and all\nwas now ready.  We waited some time, during which we could just see\nthe horses twisting round and turning, until, at length, there\nwas a shout along the lines, and on they came–heads stretched\nout and eyes starting;–working all over, both man and beast.\nThe steeds came by us like a couple of chain-shot–neck and neck;\nand now we could see nothing but their backs, and their hind hoofs\nflying in the air.  As fast as the horses passed, the crowd broke\nup behind them, and ran to the goal.  When we got there, we found\nthe horses returning on a slow walk, having run far beyond the mark,\nand heard that the long, bony one had come in head and shoulders\nbefore the other.  The riders were light-built men; had handkerchiefs\ntied round their heads; and were bare-armed and bare-legged.\nThe horses were noble-looking beasts, not so sleek and combed as\nour Boston stable-horses, but with fine limbs, and spirited eyes.\nAfter this had been settled, and fully talked over, the crowd\nscattered again and flocked back to the town.",
        "Returning to the large pulperia, we found the violin and guitar\nscreaming and twanging away under the piazza, where they had\nbeen all day.  As it was now sundown, there began to be some\ndancing.  The Italian sailors danced, and one of our crew exhibited\nhimself in a sort of West India shuffle, much to the amusement of\nthe bystanders, who cried out, “Bravo!” “Otra vez!” and “Vivan\nlos marineros!” but the dancing did not become general, as the\nwomen and the “gente de razón” had not yet made their appearance.\nWe wished very much to stay and see the style of dancing; but,\nalthough we had had our own way during the day, yet we were,\nafter all, but ’foremast Jacks; and having been ordered to be on the\nbeach by sundown, did not venture to be more than an hour behind\nthe time; so we took our way down.  We found the boat just pulling\nashore through the breakers, which were running high, there having\nbeen a heavy fog outside, which, from some cause or other, always\nbrings on, or precedes a heavy sea.  Liberty-men are privileged\nfrom the time they leave the vessel until they step on board again;\nso we took our places in the stern sheets, and were congratulating\nourselves upon getting off dry, when a great comber broke fore and\naft the boat, and wet us through and through, filling the boat\nhalf full of water.  Having lost her buoyancy by the weight of the\nwater, she dropped heavily into every sea that struck her, and by\nthe time we had pulled out of the surf into deep water, she was but\njust afloat, and we were up to our knees.  By the help of a small\nbucket and our hats, we bailed her out, got on board, hoisted the\nboats, eat our supper, changed our clothes, gave (as is usual) the\nwhole history of our day’s adventures to those who had staid on\nboard, and having taken a night-smoke, turned-in.  Thus ended\nour second day’s liberty on shore.",
        "On Monday morning, as an offset to our day’s sport, we were all\nset to work “tarring down” the rigging.  Some got girt-lines up\nfor riding down the stays and back-stays, and others tarred the\nshrouds, lifts, etc., laying out on the yards, and coming down\nthe rigging.  We overhauled our bags and took out our old tarry\ntrowsers and frocks, which we had used when we tarred down before,\nand were all at work in the rigging by sunrise.  After breakfast,\nwe had the satisfaction of seeing the Italian ship’s boat go ashore,\nfilled with men, gaily dressed, as on the day before, and singing\ntheir barcarollas.  The Easter holydays are kept up on shore during\nthree days; and being a Catholic vessel, the Crew had the advantage\nof them.  For two successive days, while perched up in the rigging,\ncovered with tar and engaged in our disagreeable work, we saw these\nfellows going ashore in the morning, and coming off again at night,\nin high spirits.  So much for being Protestants.  There’s no danger\nof Catholicism’s spreading in New England; Yankees can’t afford the\ntime to be Catholics.  American shipmasters get nearly three weeks\nmore labor out of their crews, in the course of a year, than the\nmasters of vessels from Catholic countries.  Yankees don’t keep\nChristmas, and ship-masters at sea never know when Thanksgiving\ncomes, so Jack has no festival at all.",
        "About noon, a man aloft called out “Sail ho!” and looking round,\nwe saw the head sails of a vessel coming round the point.  As she\ndrew round, she showed the broadside of a full-rigged brig, with\nthe Yankee ensign at her peak.  We ran up our stars and stripes, and,\nknowing that there was no American brig on the coast but ourselves,\nexpected to have news from home.  She rounded-to and let go her\nanchor, but the dark faces on her yards, when they furled the sails,\nand the Babel on deck, soon made known that she was from the Islands.\nImmediately afterwards, a boat’s crew came aboard, bringing her skipper,\nand from them we learned that she was from Oahu, and was engaged in\nthe same trade with the Ayacucho, Loriotte, etc., between the coast,\nthe Sandwich Islands, and the leeward coast of Peru and Chili.\nHer captain and officers were Americans, and also a part of her crew;\nthe rest were Islanders.  She was called the Catalina, and, like all\nthe others vessels in that trade, except the Ayacucho, her papers\nand colors were from Uncle Sam.  They, of course, brought us no news,\nand we were doubly disappointed, for we had thought, at first,\nit might be the ship which we were expecting from Boston.",
        "After lying here about a fortnight, and collecting all the hides the\nplace afforded, we set sail again for San Pedro.  There we found\nthe brig which we had assisted in getting off lying at anchor,\nwith a mixed crew of Americans, English, Sandwich Islanders,\nSpaniards, and Spanish Indians; and, though much smaller than we,\nyet she had three times the number of men; and she needed them,\nfor her officers were Californians.  No vessels in the world\ngo so poorly manned as American and English; and none do so well.\nA Yankee brig of that size would have had a crew of four men,\nand would have worked round and round her.  The Italian ship had a\ncrew of thirty men; nearly three times as many as the Alert, which\nwas afterwards on the coast, and was of the same size; yet the Alert\nwould get under weigh and come-to in half the time, and get two\nanchors, while they were all talking at once–jabbering like a parcel\nof “Yahoos,” and running about decks to find their cat-block.",
        "There was only one point in which they had the advantage over us,\nand that was in lightening their labors in the boats by their songs.\nThe Americans are a time and money saving people, but have not yet,\nas a nation, learned that music may be “turned to account.”  We pulled\nthe long distances to and from the shore, with our loaded boats,\nwithout a word spoken, and with discontented looks, while they not\nonly lightened the labor of rowing, but actually made it pleasant\nand cheerful, by their music.  So true is it, that–",
        "“For the tired slave, song lifts the languid oar,\n  And bids it aptly fall, with chime\nThat beautifies the fairest shore,\n  And mitigates the harshest clime.”",
        "We lay about a week in San Pedro, and got under weigh for San Diego,\nintending to stop at San Juan, as the south-easter season was\nnearly over, and there was little or no danger.",
        "This being the spring season, San Pedro, as well as all the other\nopen ports upon the coast, was filled with whales, that had come in\nto make their annual visit upon soundings.  For the first few days\nthat we were here and at Santa Barbara, we watched them with\ngreat interest–calling out “there she blows!” every time we saw the\nspout of one breaking the surface of the water; but they soon became\nso common that we took little notice of them.  They often “broke\"\nvery near us; and one thick, foggy night, during a dead calm, while\nI was standing anchor-watch, one of them rose so near, that he\nstruck our cable, and made all surge again.  He did not seem to like\nthe encounter much himself, for he sheered off, and spouted at a\ngood distance.  We once came very near running one down in the\ngig, and should probably have been knocked to pieces and blown\nsky-high.  We had been on board the little Spanish brig, and were\nreturning, stretching out well at our oars, the little boat going like a\nswallow; our backs were forward, (as is always the case in pulling,)\nand the captain, who was steering, was not looking ahead, when, all\nat once, we heard the spout of a whale directly ahead.  “Back water!\nback water, for your lives!” shouted the captain; and we backed\nour blades in the water and brought the boat to in a smother of\nfoam.  Turning our heads, we saw a great, rough, hump-backed whale,\nslowly crossing our fore foot, within three or four yards of the\nboat’s stem.  Had we not backed water just as we did, we should\ninevitably have gone smash upon him, striking him with our stem\njust about amidships.  He took no notice of us, but passed slowly on,\nand dived a few yards beyond us, throwing his tail high in the air.\nHe was so near that we had a perfect view of him and as may be\nsupposed, had no desire to see him nearer.  He was a disgusting\ncreature; with a skin rough, hairy, and of an iron-grey color.\nThis kind differs much from the sperm, in color and skin, and is said\nto be fiercer.  We saw a few sperm whales; but most of the whales\nthat come upon the coast are fin-backs, hump-backs, and right-whales,\nwhich are more difficult to take, and are said not to give oil\nenough to pay for the trouble.  For this reason whale-ships do not\ncome upon the coast after them.  Our captain, together with Captain\nNye of the Loriotte, who had been in a whale-ship, thought of\nmaking an attempt upon one of them with two boats’ crews, but\nas we had only two harpoons and no proper lines, they gave it up.",
        "During the months of March, April, and May, these whales appear in\ngreat numbers in the open ports of Santa Barbara, San Pedro, etc.,\nand hover off the coast, while a few find their way into the\nclose harbors of San Diego and Monterey.  They are all off again\nbefore midsummer, and make their appearance on the “off-shore\nground.”  We saw some fine “schools” of sperm whales, which are\neasily distinguished by their spout, blowing away, a few miles to\nwindward, on our passage to San Juan.",
        "Coasting along on the quiet shore of the Pacific, we came to anchor,\nin twenty fathoms’ water, almost out at sea, as it were, and directly\nabreast of a steep hill which overhung the water, and was twice as\nhigh as our royal-mast-head.  We had heard much of this place, from\nthe Lagoda’s crew, who said it was the worst place in California.\nThe shore is rocky, and directly exposed to the south-east, so that\nvessels are obliged to slip and run for their lives on the first\nsign of a gale; and late as it was in the season, we got up our\nslip-rope and gear, though we meant to stay only twenty-four hours.\nWe pulled the agent ashore, and were ordered to wait for him,\nwhile he took a circuitous way round the hill to the mission,\nwhich was hidden behind it.  We were glad of the opportunity to\nexamine this singular place, and hauling the boat up and making\nher well fast, took different directions up and down the beach,\nto explore it.",
        "San Juan is the only romantic spot in California.  The country\nhere for several miles is high table-land, running boldly to the shore,\nand breaking off in a steep hill, at the foot of which the waters of the\nPacific are constantly dashing.  For several miles the water washes\nthe very base of the hill, or breaks upon ledges and fragments of\nrocks which run out into the sea.  Just where we landed was a small\ncove, or “bight,” which gave us, at high tide, a few square feet of\nsand-beach between the sea and the bottom of the hill.  This was\nthe only landing-place.  Directly before us, rose the perpendicular\nheight of four or five hundred feet.  How we were to get hides down,\nor goods up, upon the table-land on which the mission was situated,\nwas more than we could tell.  The agent had taken a long circuit,\nand yet had frequently to jump over breaks, and climb up steep\nplaces, in the ascent.  No animal but a man or monkey could get up\nit.  However, that was not our look-out; and knowing that the agent\nwould be gone an hour or more, we strolled about, picking up shells,\nand following the sea where it tumbled in, roaring and spouting,\namong the crevices of the great rocks.  What a sight, thought I, must\nthis be in a south-easter! The rocks were as large as those of Nahant\nor Newport, but, to my eye, more grand and broken.  Beside, there\nwas a grandeur in everything around, which gave almost a solemnity\nto the scene: a silence and solitariness which affected everything!\nNot a human being but ourselves for miles; and no sound heard but\nthe pulsations of the great Pacific! and the great steep hill rising\nlike a wall, and cutting us off from all the world, but the “world of\nwaters!”  I separated myself from the rest and sat down on a rock,\njust where the sea ran in and formed a fine spouting horn.\nCompared with the plain, dull sand-beach of the rest of the coast,\nthis grandeur was as refreshing as a great rock in a weary land.\nIt was almost the first time that I had been positively alone–free\nfrom the sense that human beings were at my elbow, if not talking\nwith me–since I had left home.  My better nature returned strong\nupon me.  Everything was in accordance with my state of feeling,\nand I experienced a glow of pleasure at finding that what of poetry\nand romance I ever had in me, had not been entirely deadened by the\nlaborious and frittering life I had led.  Nearly an hour did I sit,\nalmost lost in the luxury of this entire new scene of the play in\nwhich I had been so long acting, when I was aroused by the distant\nshouts of my companions, and saw that they were collecting together,\nas the agent had made his appearance, on his way back to our\nboat.",
        "We pulled aboard, and found the long-boat hoisted out, and nearly\nladen with goods; and after dinner, we all went on shore in the\nquarter-boat, with the long-boat in tow.  As we drew in, we found\nan ox-cart and a couple of men standing directly on the brow of the\nhill; and having landed, the captain took his way round the hill,\nordering me and one other to follow him.  We followed, picking our\nway out, and jumping and scrambling up, walking over briers and\nprickly pears, until we came to the top.  Here the country stretched\nout for miles as far as the eye could reach, on a level, table surface;\nand the only habitation in sight was the small white mission of San\nJuan Capistrano, with a few Indian huts about it, standing in a\nsmall hollow, about a mile from where we were.  Reaching the brow\nof the hill where the cart stood, we found several piles of hides,\nand Indians sitting round them.  One or two other carts were coming\nslowly on from the mission, and the captain told us to begin and\nthrow the hides down.  This, then, was the way they were to be got\ndown: thrown down, one at a time, a distance of four hundred\nfeet! This was doing the business on a great scale.  Standing on\nthe edge of the hill and looking down the perpendicular height,\nthe sailors,",
        "–\"That walk upon the beach,\nAppeared like mice; and our tall anchoring bark\nDiminished to her cock; her cock a buoy\nAlmost too small for sight.”",
        "Down this height we pitched the hides, throwing them as far out\ninto the air as we could; and as they were all large, stiff,\nand doubled, like the cover of a book, the wind took them, and they\nswayed and eddied about, plunging and rising in the air, like a kite\nwhen it has broken its string.  As it was now low tide, there was\nno danger of their falling into the water, and as fast as they came\nto ground, the men below picked them up, and taking them on their\nheads, walked off with them to the boat.  It was really a picturesque\nsight: the great height; the scaling of the hides; and the continual\nwalking to and fro of the men, who looked like mites, on the beach!\nThis was the romance of hide-droghing!",
        "Some of the hides lodged in cavities which were under the bank and\nout of our sight, being directly under us; but by sending others down\nin the same direction, we succeeded in dislodging them.  Had they\nremained there, the captain said he should have sent on board for\na couple of pairs of long halyards, and got some one to have gone\ndown for them.  It was said that one of the crew of an English brig\nwent down in the same way, a few years before.  We looked over,\nand thought it would not be a welcome task, especially for a few\npaltry hides; but no one knows what he can do until he is called\nupon; for, six months afterwards, I went down the same place by\na pair of top-gallant studding-sail halyards, to save a half a\ndozen hides which had lodged there.",
        "Having thrown them all down, we took our way back again,\nand found the boat loaded and ready to start.  We pulled off;\ntook the hides all aboard; hoisted in the boats; hove up our anchor;\nmade sail; and before sundown, were on our way to San Diego.",
        "Friday, May 8th, 1835.  Arrived at San Diego.  Here we found the\nlittle harbor deserted.  The Lagoda, Ayacucho, Loriotte, and all,\nhad left the coast, and we were nearly alone.  All the hide-houses\non the beach, but ours, were shut up, and the Sandwich Islanders,\na dozen or twenty in number, who had worked for the other vessels and\nbeen paid off when they sailed, were living on the beach, keeping up\na grand carnival.  A Russian discovery-ship which had been in this\nport a few years before, had built a large oven for baking bread,\nand went away, leaving it standing.  This, the Sandwich Islanders\ntook possession of, and had kept, ever since, undisturbed.  It was\nbig enough to hold six or eight men–that is, it was as large as\na ship’s forecastle; had a door at the side, and a vent-hole at\ntop.  They covered it with Oahu mats, for a carpet; stopped up the\nvent-hole in bad weather, and made it their head-quarters.  It was\nnow inhabited by as many as a dozen or twenty men, who lived there\nin complete idleness–drinking, playing cards, and carousing in\nevery way.  They bought a bullock once a week, which kept them\nin meat, and one of them went up to the town every day to get\nfruit, liquor, and provisions.  Besides this, they had bought\na cask of ship-bread, and a barrel of flour from the Lagoda,\nbefore she sailed.  There they lived, having a grand time,\nand caring for nobody.  Captain T––- was anxious to get\nthree or four of them to come on board the Pilgrim, as we were\nso much diminished in numbers; and went up to the oven and spent\nan hour or two trying to negotiate with them.  One of them,–a\nfinely built, active, strong and intelligent fellow,– who was\na sort of king among them, acted as spokesman.  He was called\nMannini,–or rather, out of compliment to his known importance\nand influence, Mr. Mannini–and was known all over California.\nThrough him, the captain offered them fifteen dollars a month,\nand one month’s pay in advance; but it was like throwing pearls\nbefore swine, or rather, carrying coals to Newcastle.  So long\nas they had money, they would not work for fifty dollars a month,\nand when their money was gone, they would work for ten.",
        "“What do you do here, Mr. Mannini?\"(1) said the captain.",
        "–––––––––––––––\n1. The letter i in the Sandwich Island language is sounded\n   like e in the English.\n–––––––––––––––",
        "“Oh, we play cards, get drunk, smoke–do anything we’re a mind to.”",
        "“Don’t you want to come aboard and work?”",
        "“Aole! aole make make makou i ka hana.  Now, got plenty money;\nno good, work.  Mamule, money pau–all gone.  Ah! very good, work!–\nmaikai, hana hana nui!”",
        "“But you’ll spend all your money in this way,” said the captain.",
        "“Aye! me know that.  By-’em-by money pau–all gone; then Kanaka work plenty.”",
        "This was a hopeless case, and the captain left them, to wait\npatiently until their money was gone.",
        "We discharged our hides and tallow, and in about a week were\nready to set sail again for the windward.  We unmoored, and got\neverything ready, when the captain made another attempt upon the\noven.  This time he had more regard to the “mollia tempora fandi,\"\nand succeeded very well.  He got Mr. Mannini in his interest, and\nas the shot was getting low in the locker, prevailed upon him and\nthree others to come on board with their chests and baggage, and\nsent a hasty summons to me and the boy to come ashore with our\nthings, and join the gang at the hide-house.  This was unexpected\nto me; but anything in the way of variety I liked; so we got ready,\nand were pulled ashore.  I stood on the beach while the brig got\nunder weigh, and watched her until she rounded the point, and\nthen went up to the hide-house to take up my quarters for a few\nmonths.",
        "Here was a change in my life as complete as it had been sudden.\nIn the twinkling of an eye, I was transformed from a sailor into a\n\"beach-comber” and a hide-curer; yet the novelty and the comparative\nindependence of the life were not unpleasant.  Our hide-house was a\nlarge building, made of rough boards, and intended to hold forty\nthousand hides.  In one corner of it, a small room was parted off,\nin which four berths were made, where we were to live, with mother\nearth for our floor.  It contained a table, a small locker for pots,\nspoons, plates, etc., and a small hole cut to let in the light.\nHere we put our chests, threw our bedding into the berths, and took\nup our quarters.  Over our head was another small room, in which\nMr. Russell lived, who had charge of the hide-house; the same man\nwho was for a time an officer of the Pilgrim.  There he lived in\nsolitary grandeur; eating and sleeping alone, (and these were his\nprincipal occupations,) and communing with his own dignity.\nThe boy was to act as cook; while myself, a giant of a Frenchman\nnamed Nicholas, and four Sandwich Islanders, were to cure the hides.\nSam, the Frenchman, and myself, lived together in the room, and the\nfour Sandwich Islanders worked and ate with us, but generally slept\nat the oven.  My new messmate, Nicholas, was the most immense man\nthat I had ever seen in my life.  He came on the coast in a vessel\nwhich was afterwards wrecked, and now let himself out to the\ndifferent houses to cure hides.  He was considerably over six\nfeet, and of a frame so large that he might have been shown\nfor a curiosity.  But the most remarkable thing about him was his\nfeet.  They were so large that he could not find a pair of shoes\nin California to fit him, and was obliged to send to Oahu for a\npair; and when he got them, he was compelled to wear them down at\nthe heel.  He told me once, himself, that he was wrecked in an\nAmerican brig on the Goodwin Sands, and was sent up to London,\nto the charge of the American consul, without clothing to his\nback or shoes to his feet, and was obliged to go about London\nstreets in his stocking feet three or four days, in the month\nof January, until the consul could have a pair of shoes made\nfor him.  His strength was in proportion to his size, and his\nignorance to his strength–\"strong as an ox, and ignorant as\nstrong.”  He neither knew how to read nor write.  He had been\nto sea from a boy, and had seen all kinds of service, and been\nin every kind of vessel: merchantmen, men-of-war, privateers,\nand slavers; and from what I could gather from his accounts of\nhimself, and from what he once told me, in confidence, after we\nhad become better acquainted, he had even been in worse business\nthan slave-trading.  He was once tried for his life in Charleston,\nSouth Carolina, and though acquitted, yet he was so frightened that\nhe never would show himself in the United States again; and I could\nnot persuade him that he could never be tried a second time for the\nsame offence.  He said he had got safe off from the breakers, and was\ntoo good a sailor to risk his timbers again.",
        "Though I knew what his life had been, yet I never had the slightest\nfear of him.  We always got along very well together, and, though\nso much stronger and larger than I, he showed a respect for\nmy education, and for what he had heard of my situation before\ncoming to sea.  “I’ll be good friends with you,” he used to say,\n\"for by-and-by you’ll come out here captain, and then you’ll haze me\nwell!”  By holding well together, we kept the officer in good order,\nfor he was evidently afraid of Nicholas, and never ordered us,\nexcept when employed upon the hides.  My other companions,\nthe Sandwich Islanders, deserve particular notice.",
        "A considerable trade has been carried on for several years between\nCalifornia and the Sandwich Islands, and most of the vessels are\nmanned with Islanders; who, as they, for the most part, sign no\narticles, leave whenever they choose, and let themselves out to\ncure hides at San Diego, and to supply the places of the men of the\nAmerican vessels while on the coast.  In this way, quite a colony\nof them had become settled at San Diego, as their headquarters.\nSome of these had recently gone off in the Ayacucho and Loriotte,\nand the Pilgrim had taken Mr. Mannini and three others, so that\nthere were not more than twenty left.   Of these, four were on pay\nat the Ayacucho’s house, four more working with us, and the rest\nwere living at the oven in a quiet way; for their money was nearly\ngone, and they must make it last until some other vessel came down\nto employ them.",
        "During the four months that I lived here, I got well acquainted\nwith all of them, and took the greatest pains to become familiar\nwith their language, habits, and characters.  Their language,\nI could only learn, orally, for they had not any books among them,\nthough many of them had been taught to read and write by the\nmissionaries at home.  They spoke a little English, and by a sort\nof compromise, a mixed language was used on the beach, which could be\nunderstood by all.  The long name of Sandwich Islanders is dropped,\nand they are called by the whites, all over the Pacific ocean,\n\"Kanákas,” from a word in their own language which they apply to\nthemselves, and to all South Sea Islanders, in distinction from\nwhites, whom they call “Haole.”  This name, “Kanaka,” they answer to,\nboth collectively and individually.  Their proper names, in their\nown language, being difficult to pronounce and remember, they are\ncalled by any names which the captains or crews may choose to\ngive them.  Some are called after the vessel they are in; others\nby common names, as Jack, Tom, Bill; and some have fancy names,\nas Ban-yan, Fore-top, Rope-yarn, Pelican, etc., etc.  Of the four\nwho worked at our house one was named “Mr. Bingham,” after the\nmissionary at Oahu; another, Hope, after a vessel that he had been\nin; a third, Tom Davis, the name of his first captain; and the fourth,\nPelican, from his fancied resemblance to that bird.  Then there was\nLagoda-Jack, California-Bill, etc., etc.  But by whatever names\nthey might be called, they were the most interesting, intelligent,\nand kind-hearted people that I ever fell in with.  I felt a positive\nattachment for almost all of them; and many of them I have, to this\ntime, a feeling for, which would lead me to go a great way for the\nmere pleasure of seeing them, and which will always make me feel a\nstrong interest in the mere name of a Sandwich Islander.",
        "Tom Davis knew how to read, write, and cipher in common arithmetic;\nhad been to the United States, and spoke English quite well.\nHis education was as good as that of three-quarters of the Yankees\nin California, and his manners and principles a good deal better,\nand he was so quick of apprehension that he might have been taught\nnavigation, and the elements of many of the sciences, with the most\nperfect ease.  Old “Mr. Bingham” spoke very little English–almost\nnone, and neither knew how to read nor write; but he was the\nbest-hearted old fellow in the world.  He must have been over fifty\nyears of age, and had two of his front teeth knocked out, which was\ndone by his parents as a sign of grief at the death of Kamehameha,\nthe great king of the Sandwich Islands.  We used to tell him that he\nate Captain Cook, and lost his teeth in that way.  That was the only\nthing that ever made him angry.  He would always be quite excited\nat that; and say–\"Aole!” (no.)  “Me no eat Captain Cook!  Me\npikinini–small–so high–no more!  My father see Captain Cook!\nMe–no!”  None of them liked to have anything said about Captain\nCook, for the sailors all believe that he was eaten, and that,\nthey cannot endure to be taunted with.–\"New Zealand Kanaka eat\nwhite man;–Sandwich Island Kanaka–no.  Sandwich Island Kanaka\nua like pu na haole–all ’e same a’ you!”",
        "Mr. Bingham was a sort of patriarch among them, and was always\ntreated with great respect, though he had not the education and energy\nwhich gave Mr. Mannini his power over them.  I have spent hours in\ntalking with this old fellow about Kamehameha, the Charlemagne\nof the Sandwich Islands; his son and successor Riho Riho, who died\nin England, and was brought to Oahu in the frigate Blonde, Captain\nLord Byron, and whose funeral he remembered perfectly; and also\nabout the customs of his country in his boyhood, and the changes\nwhich had been made by the missionaries.  He never would allow that\nhuman beings had been eaten there; and, indeed, it always seemed\nlike an insult to tell so affectionate, intelligent, and civilized\na class of men, that such barbarities had been practised in their\nown country within the recollection of many of them.  Certainly,\nthe history of no people on the globe can show anything like so\nrapid an advance.  I would have trusted my life and my fortune in\nthe hands of any one of these people; and certainly had I wished\nfor a favor or act of sacrifice, I would have gone to them all,\nin turn, before I should have applied to one of my own countrymen\non the coast, and should have expected to have seen it done,\nbefore my own countrymen had got half through counting the cost.\nTheir costumes, and manner of treating one another, show a simple,\nprimitive generosity, which is truly delightful; and which is often\na reproach to our own people.  Whatever one has, they all have.\nMoney, food, clothes, they share with one another; even to the\nlast piece of tobacco to put in their pipes.  I once heard old\nMr. Bingham say, with the highest indignation, to a Yankee trader\nwho was trying to persuade him to keep his money to himself–\"No!\nWe no all ’e same a’ you!–Suppose one got money, all got money.\nYou;–suppose one got money–lock him up in chest.–No good!\"–\n\"Kanaka all ’e same a’ one!”  This principle they carry so far,\nthat none of them will eat anything in the sight of others without\noffering it all round.  I have seen one of them break a biscuit,\nwhich had been given him, into five parts, at a time when I knew\nhe was on a very short allowance, as there was but little to eat\non the beach.",
        "My favorite among all of them, and one who was liked by both officers\nand men, and by whomever he had anything to do with, was Hope.\nHe was an intelligent, kind-hearted little fellow, and I never\nsaw him angry, though I knew him for more than a year, and have\nseen him imposed upon by white people, and abused by insolent\nofficers of vessels.  He was always civil, and always ready,\nand never forgot a benefit.  I once took care of him when he was ill,\ngetting medicines from the ship’s chests, when no captain or officer\nwould do anything for him, and he never forgot it.  Every Kanaka has\none particular friend, whom he considers himself bound to do\neverything for, and with whom he has a sort of contract,–an\nalliance offensive and defensive,–and for whom he will often make\nthe greatest sacrifices.  This friend they call aikane; and for such\ndid Hope adopt me.  I do not believe I could have wanted anything\nwhich he had, that he would not have given me.  In return for this,\nI was always his friend among the Americans, and used to teach\nhim letters and numbers; for he left home before he had learned\nhow to read.  He was very curious about Boston (as they call the\nUnited States); asking many questions about the houses, the people,\netc., and always wished to have the pictures in books explained to\nhim.  They were all astonishingly quick in catching at explanations,\nand many things which I had thought it utterly impossible to make\nthem understand, they often seized in an instant, and asked\nquestions which showed that they knew enough to make them wish to\ngo farther.  The pictures of steamboats and railroad cars, in the\ncolumns of some newspapers which I had, gave me great difficulty\nto explain.  The grading of the road, the rails, the construction of\nthe carriages, they could easily understand, but the motion produced\nby steam was a little too refined for them.  I attempted to show it\nto them once by an experiment upon the cook’s coppers, but failed;\nprobably as much from my own ignorance as from their want of\napprehension; and, I have no doubt, left them with about as clear\nan idea of the principle as I had myself.  This difficulty, of course,\nexisted in the same force with the steamboats and all I could do was\nto give them some account of the results, in the shape of speed; for,\nfailing in the reason, I had to fall back upon the fact.  In my account\nof the speed I was supported by Tom, who had been to Nantucket,\nand seen a little steamboat which ran over to New Bedford.",
        "A map of the world, which I once showed them, kept their attention\nfor hours; those who knew how to read pointing out the places\nand referring to me for the distances.  I remember being much\namused with a question which Hope asked me.  Pointing to the large\nirregular place which is always left blank round the poles, to\ndenote that it is undiscovered, he looked up and asked.–\"Pau?\"\n(Done? ended?)",
        "The system of naming the streets and numbering the houses, they\neasily understood, and the utility of it.  They had a great desire to\nsee America, but were afraid of doubling Cape Horn, for they suffer\nmuch in cold weather, and had heard dreadful accounts of the Cape,\nfrom those of their number who had been round it.",
        "They smoke a great deal, though not much at a time; using pipes\nwith large bowls, and very short stems, or no stems at all.  These,\nthey light, and putting them to their mouths, take a long draught,\ngetting their mouths as full as they can hold, and their cheeks\ndistended, and then let it slowly out through their mouths and nostrils.\nThe pipe is then passed to others, who draw, in the same manner,\none pipe-full serving for half a dozen.  They never take short,\ncontinuous draughts, like Europeans, but one of these “Oahu puffs,\"\nas the sailors call them, serves for an hour or two, until some one\nelse lights his pipe, and it is passed round in the same manner.\nEach Kanaka on the beach had a pipe, flint, steel, tinder, a hand\nof tobacco, and a jack-knife, which he always carried about with him.",
        "That which strikes a stranger most peculiarly is their style of\nsinging.  They run on, in a low, guttural, monotonous sort of chant,\ntheir lips and tongues seeming hardly to move, and the sounds modulated\nsolely in the throat.  There is very little tune to it, and the\nwords, so far as I could learn, are extempore.  They sing about\npersons and things which are around them, and adopt this method\nwhen they do not wish to be understood by any but themselves;\nand it is very effectual, for with the most careful attention I never\ncould detect a word that I knew.  I have often heard Mr. Mannini,\nwho was the most noted improvisatore among them, sing for an hour\ntogether, when at work in the midst of Americans and Englishmen;\nand, by the occasional shouts and laughter of the Kanakas,\nwho were at a distance, it was evident that he was singing about\nthe different men that he was at work with.  They have great powers\nof ridicule, and are excellent mimics; many of them discovering and\nimitating the peculiarities of our own people, before we had seen\nthem ourselves.",
        "These were the people with whom I was to spend a few months;\nand who, with the exception of the officer, Nicholas the Frenchman,\nand the boy, made the whole population of the beach.  I ought,\nperhaps, to except the dogs, for they were an important part of our\nsettlement.  Some of the first vessels brought dogs out with them,\nwho, for convenience, were left ashore, and there multiplied,\nuntil they came to be a great people.  While I was on the beach,\nthe average number was about forty, and probably an equal, or\ngreater number are drowned, or killed in some other way, every year.\nThey are very useful in guarding the beach, the Indians being afraid\nto come down at night; for it was impossible for any one to get within\nhalf a mile of the hide-houses without a general alarm.  The father\nof the colony, old Sachem, so called from the ship in which he was\nbrought out, died while I was there, full of years, and was honorably\nburied.  Hogs, and a few chickens, were the rest of the animal tribe,\nand formed, like the dogs, a common company, though they were all\nknown and marked, and usually fed at the houses to which they\nbelonged.",
        "I had been but a few hours on the beach, and the Pilgrim was\nhardly out of sight, when the cry of “Sail ho!” was raised, and a\nsmall hermaphrodite brig rounded the point, bore up into the harbor,\nand came to anchor.  It was the Mexican brig Fazio, which we\nhad left at San Pedro, and which had come down to land her tallow,\ntry it all over, and make new bags, and then take it in, and leave the\ncoast.  They moored ship, erected their try-works on shore, put up\na small tent, in which they all lived, and commenced operations.\nThey made an addition to our society, and we spent many evenings in\ntheir tent, where, amid the Babel of English, Spanish, French, Indian,\nand Kanaka, we found some words that we could understand in common.",
        "The morning after my landing, I began the duties of hide-curing.\nIn order to understand these, it will be necessary to give the whole\nhistory of a hide, from the time it is taken from a bullock until it\nis put on board the vessel to be carried to Boston.  When the hide\nis taken from the bullock, holes are cut round it, near the edge,\nby which it is staked out to dry.  In this manner it dries without\nshrinking.  After they are thus dried in the sun, they are received by\nthe vessels, and brought down to the depot at San Diego.  The vessels\nland them, and leave them in large piles near the houses.",
        "Then begins the hide-curer’s duty.  The first thing is to put them\nin soak.  This is done by carrying them down at low tide, and making\nthem fast, in small piles, by ropes, and letting the tide come up\nand cover them.  Every day we put in soak twenty-five for each\nman, which, with us, made an hundred and fifty.  There they\nlie forty-eight hours, when they are taken out, and rolled up,\nin wheelbarrows, and thrown into the vats.  These vats contain brine,\nmade very strong; being sea-water, with great quantities of salt thrown\nin.  This pickles the hides, and in this they lie forty-eight hours;\nthe use of the sea-water, into which they are first put, being merely\nto soften and clean them.  From these vats, they are taken, and lie on\na platform twenty-four hours, and then are spread upon the ground,\nand carefully stretched and staked out, so that they may dry smooth.\nAfter they were staked, and while yet wet and soft, we used to go\nupon them with our knives, and carefully cut off all the bad parts:–\nthe pieces of meat and fat, which would corrupt and infect the whole\nif stowed away in a vessel for many months, the large flippers,\nthe ears, and all other parts which would prevent close stowage.\nThis was the most difficult part of our duty: as it required much\nskill to take everything necessary off and not to cut or injure the hide.\nIt was also a long process, as six of us had to clean an hundred and\nfifty, most of which required a great deal to be done to them, as the\nSpaniards are very careless in skinning their cattle.  Then, too,\nas we cleaned them while they were staked out, we were obliged to\nkneel down upon them, which always gives beginners the back-ache.\nThe first day, I was so slow and awkward that I cleaned only eight;\nat the end of a few days I doubled my number; and in a fortnight or\nthree weeks, could keep up with the others, and clean my proportion\n–twenty-five.",
        "This cleaning must be got through with before noon; for by that\ntime they get too dry.  After the sun has been upon them a few\nhours, they are carefully gone over with scrapers, to get off all the\ngrease which the sun brings out.  This being done, the stakes are\npulled up, and the hides carefully doubled, with the hair side out,\nand left to dry.  About the middle of the afternoon they are turned\nupon the other side, and at sundown piled up and covered over.\nThe next day they are spread out and opened again, and at night,\nif fully dry, are thrown upon a long, horizontal pole, five at\na time, and beat with flails.  This takes all the dust from them.\nThen, being salted, scraped, cleaned, dried, and beaten, they are\nstowed away in the house.  Here ends their history, except that\nthey are taken out again when the vessel is ready to go home, beaten,\nstowed away on board, carried to Boston, tanned, made into shoes and\nother articles for which leather is used; and many of them, very probably,\nin the end, brought back again to California in the shape of shoes,\nand worn out in pursuit of other bullocks, or in the curing of\nother hides.",
        "By putting an hundred and fifty in soak every day, we had the\nsame number at each stage of curing, on each day; so that we had,\nevery day, the same work to do upon the same number: an hundred\nand fifty to put in soak; an hundred and fifty to wash out and put\nin the vat; the same number to haul from the vat and put on the\nplatform to drain; the same number to spread and stake out and\nclean; and the same number to beat and stow away in the home.\nI ought to except Sunday; for, by a prescription which no captain\nor agent has yet ventured to break in upon, Sunday has been a day\nof leisure on the beach for years.  On Saturday night, the hides,\nin every stage of progress, are carefully covered up, and not\nuncovered until Monday morning.  On Sundays we had absolutely\nno work to do, unless it was to kill a bullock, which was sent\ndown for our use about once a week, and sometimes came on Sunday.\nAnother good arrangement was, that we had just so much work to do,\nand when that was through, the time was our own.  Knowing this,\nwe worked hard, and needed no driving.  We “turned out” every\nmorning at the first signs of daylight, and allowing a short time,\nabout eight o’clock, for breakfast, generally got through our labor\nbetween one and two o’clock, when we dined, and had the rest of the\ntime to ourselves; until just before sundown, when we beat the dry\nhides and put them in the house, and covered over all the others.\nBy this means we had about three hours to ourselves every afternoon;\nand at sundown we had our supper, and our work was done for the day.\nThere was no watch to stand, and no topsails to reef.  The evenings\nwe generally spent at one another’s houses, and I often went up and\nspent an hour or so at the oven; which was called the “Kanaka Hotel,\"\nand the “Oahu Coffee-house.”  Immediately after dinner we usually\ntook a short siésta to make up for our early rising, and spent the\nrest of the afternoon according to our own fancies.  I generally\nread, wrote, and made or mended clothes; for necessity, the mother\nof invention, had taught me these two latter arts.  The Kanakas went\nup to the oven, and spent the time in sleeping, talking, and smoking;\nand my messmate, Nicholas, who neither knew how to read or write,\npassed away the time by a long siésta, two or three smokes with\nhis pipe, and a paséo to the other houses.  This leisure time is\nnever interfered with, for the captains know that the men earn it\nby working hard and fast, and that if they interfered with it,\nthe men could easily make their twenty-five hides apiece last\nthrough the day.  We were pretty independent, too, for the master\nof the house–\"capitan de la casa\"– had nothing to say to us,\nexcept when we were at work on the hides, and although we could\nnot go up to the town without his permission, this was seldom or\nnever refused.",
        "The great weight of the wet hides, which we were obliged to roll\nabout in wheelbarrows; the continual stooping upon those which\nwere pegged out to be cleaned; and the smell of the vats, into which\nwe were often obliged to get, knee-deep, to press down the hides;\nall made the work disagreeable and fatiguing;–but we soon got\nhardened to it, and the comparative independence of our life\nreconciled us to it; for there was nobody to haze us and find fault;\nand when we got through, we had only to wash and change our clothes,\nand our time was our own.  There was, however, one exception to the\ntime’s being our own; which was, that on two afternoons of every\nweek we were obliged to go off and get wood, for the cook to use\nin the galley.  Wood is very scarce in the vicinity of San Diego;\nthere being no trees of any size, for miles.  In the town,\nthe inhabitants burn the small wood which grows in thickets,\nand for which they send out Indians, in large numbers, every few days.\nFortunately, the climate is so fine that they had no need of a fire in\ntheir houses, and only use it for cooking.  With us the getting of\nwood was a great trouble; for all that in the vicinity of the houses\nhad been cut down, and we were obliged to go off a mile or two,\nand to carry it some distance on our backs, as we could not get the\nhand-cart up the hills and over the uneven places.  Two afternoons\nin the week, generally Monday and Thursday, as soon as we had got\nthrough dinner, we started off for the bush, each of us furnished\nwith a hatchet and a long piece of rope, and dragging the hand-cart\nbehind us, and followed by the whole colony of dogs, who were\nalways ready for the bush, and were half mad whenever they saw\nour preparations.  We went with the hand-cart as far as we could\nconveniently drag it, and leaving it in an open, conspicuous place,\nseparated ourselves; each taking his own course, and looking about\nfor some good place to begin upon.  Frequently, we had to go nearly\na mile from the hand-cart before we could find any fit place.\nHaving lighted upon a good thicket, the next thing was to clear\naway the under-brush, and have fair play at the trees.  These trees\nare seldom more than five or six feet high, and the highest that I\never saw in these expeditions could not have been more than twelve;\nso that, with lopping off the branches and clearing away the underwood,\nwe had a good deal of cutting to do for a very little wood.  Having cut\nenough for a “back-load,” the next thing was to make it well fast\nwith the rope, and heaving the bundle upon our backs, and taking\nthe hatchet in hand, to walk off, up hill and down dale, to the\nhand-cart.  Two good back-loads apiece filled the hand-cart;\nand that was each one’s proportion.  When each had brought down\nhis second load, we filled the hand-cart, and took our way again\nslowly back, and unloading, covering the hides for the night,\nand getting our supper, finished the day’s work.",
        "These wooding excursions had always a mixture of something\nrather pleasant in them.  Roaming about in the woods with hatchet\nin hand, like a backwoodsman, followed by a troop of dogs; starting\nup of birds, snakes, hares and foxes, and examining the various kinds\nof trees, flowers, and birds’ nests, was at least, a change from\nthe monotonous drag and pull on shipboard.  Frequently, too,\nwe had some amusement and adventure.  The coati, of which I have\nbefore spoken,–a sort of mixture of the fox and wolf breeds,–fierce\nlittle animals, with bushy tails and large heads, and a quick, sharp\nbark, abound here, as in all other parts of California.  These,\nthe dogs were very watchful for, and whenever they saw them,\nstarted off in full run after them.  We had many fine chases;\nyet, although our dogs ran finely, the rascals generally escaped.\nThey are a match for the dog,–-one to one,–but as the dogs\ngenerally went in squads, there was seldom a fair fight.  A smaller\ndog, belonging to us, once attacked a coati, single, and got a good\ndeal worsted, and might perhaps have been killed had we not come to\nhis assistance.  We had, however, one dog which gave them a good\ndeal of trouble, and many hard runs.  He was a fine, tall fellow,\nand united strength and agility better than any dog that I have\never seen.  He was born at the Islands, his father being an English\nmastiff, and his mother a greyhound.  He had the high head, long legs,\nnarrow body, and springing gait of the latter, and the heavy jaw,\nthick jowls, and strong fore-quarters of the mastiff.  When he was\nbrought to San Diego, an English sailor said that he looked,\nabout the face, precisely like the Duke of Wellington, whom he had\nonce seen at the Tower; and, indeed, there was something about him\nwhich resembled the portraits of the Duke.  From this time he was\nchristened “Welly,” and became the favorite and bully of the beach.\nHe always led the dogs by several yards in the chase, and had killed\ntwo coati at different times in single combats.  We often had fine\nsport with these fellows.  A quick, sharp bark from a coati, and in\nan instant every dog was at the height of his speed.  A few moments\nmade up for an unfair start, and gave each dog his relative place.\nWelly, at the head, seemed almost to skim over the bushes; and after\nhim came Fanny, Feliciana, Childers, and the other fleet ones,–\nthe spaniels and terriers; and then behind, followed the heavy\ncorps–bulldogs, etc., for we had every breed.  Pursuit by us was\nin vain, and in about half an hour a few of them would come panting\nand straggling back.",
        "Beside the coati, the dogs sometimes made prizes of rabbits and\nhares, which are very plentiful here, and great numbers of which\nwe often shot for our dinners.  There was another animal that I\nwas not so much disposed to find amusement from, and that was the\nrattlesnake.  These are very abundant here, especially during the\nspring of the year.  The latter part of the time that I was on shore,\nI did not meet with so many, but for the first two months we seldom\nwent into “the bush” without one of our number starting some of them.\nThe first that I ever saw, I remember perfectly well.  I had left my\ncompanions, and was beginning to clear away a fine clump of trees,\nwhen just in the midst of the thicket, not more than eight yards from\nme, one of these fellows set up his hiss.  It is a sharp, continuous\nsound, and resembles very much the letting off of the steam from\nthe small pipe of a steamboat, except that it is on a smaller scale.\nI knew, by the sound of an axe, that one of my companions was near,\nand called out to him, to let him know what I had fallen upon.\nHe took it very lightly, and as he seemed inclined to laugh at me for\nbeing afraid, I determined to keep my place.  I knew that so long\nas I could hear the rattle, I was safe, for these snakes never make\na noise when they are in motion.  Accordingly, I kept at my work,\nand the noise which I made with cutting and breaking the trees kept\nhim in alarm; so that I had the rattle to show me his whereabouts.\nOnce or twice the noise stopped for a short time, which gave me a\nlittle uneasiness, and retreating a few steps, I threw something\ninto the bush, at which he would set his rattle agoing; and finding\nthat he had not moved from his first place, I was easy again.\nIn this way I continued at my work until I had cut a full load,\nnever suffering him to be quiet for a moment.  Having cut my load,\nI strapped it together, and got everything ready for starting. \nI felt that I could now call the others without the imputation of\nbeing afraid; and went in search of them.  In a few minutes we\nwere all collected, and began an attack upon the bush.  The big\nFrenchman, who was the one that I had called to at first, I found\nas little inclined to approach the snake as I had been.  The dogs,\ntoo, seemed afraid of the rattle, and kept up a barking at a safe\ndistance; but the Kanakas showed no fear, and getting long sticks,\nwent into the bush, and keeping a bright look-out, stood within a\nfew feet of him.  One or two blows struck near him, and a few stones\nthrown, started him, and we lost his track, and had the pleasant\nconsciousness that he might be directly under our feet.  By throwing\nstones and chips in different directions, we made him spring his\nrattle again, and began another attack.  This time we drove him\ninto the clear ground, and saw him gliding off, with head and tail\nerect, when a stone, well aimed, knocked him over the bank, down a\ndeclivity of fifteen or twenty feet, and stretched him at his length.\nHaving made sure of him, by a few more stones, we went down, and one\nof the Kanakas cut off his rattle.  These rattles vary in number it\nis said, according to the age of the snake; though the Indians think\nthey indicate the number of creatures they have killed.  We always\npreserved them as trophies, and at the end of the summer had quite\na number.  None of our people were ever bitten by them, but one of\nour dogs died of a bite, and another was supposed to have been bitten,\nbut recovered.  We had no remedy for the bite, though it was said that\nthe Indians of the country had, and the Kanakas professed to have an\nherb which would cure it, but it was fortunately never brought to the test.",
        "Hares and rabbits, as I said before, were abundant, and, during the\nwinter months, the waters are covered with wild ducks and geese.\nCrows, too, were very numerous, and frequently alighted in great\nnumbers upon our hides, picking at the pieces of dried meat and fat.\nBears and wolves are numerous in the upper parts, and in the interior,\n(and, indeed, a man was killed by a bear within a few miles of\nSan Pedro, while we were there,) but there were none in our\nimmediate neighborhood.  The only other animals were horses.\nOver a dozen of these were owned by different people on the beach,\nand were allowed to run loose among the hills, with a long lasso\nattached to them, and pick up feed wherever they could find it.\nWe were sure of seeing them once a day, for there was no water\namong the hills, and they were obliged to come down to the well\nwhich had been dug upon the beach.  These horses were bought at,\nfrom two, to six and eight dollars apiece, and were held very much\nas common property.  We generally kept one fast to one of the houses\nevery day, so that we could mount him and catch any of the others.\nSome of them were really fine animals, and gave us many good runs\nup to the Presidio and over the country.",
        "After we had been a few weeks on shore, and had begun to feel\nbroken into the regularity of our life, its monotony was\ninterrupted by the arrival of two vessels from the windward.\nWe were sitting at dinner in our little room, when we heard the cry\nof “Sail ho!”  This, we had learned, did not always signify a vessel,\nbut was raised whenever a woman was seen coming down from the town;\nor a squaw, or an ox-cart, or anything unusual, hove in sight upon\nthe road; so we took no notice of it.  But it soon became so loud\nand general from all parts of the beach, that we were led to go\nto the door; and there, sure enough, were two sails coming round\nthe point, and leaning over from the strong north-west wind,\nwhich blows down the coast every afternoon.  The headmost was a\nship, and the other, a brig.  Everybody was alive on the beach,\nand all manner of conjectures were abroad.  Some said it was the\nPilgrim, with the Boston ship, which we were expecting; but we soon\nsaw that the brig was not the Pilgrim, and the ship with her stump\ntop-gallant masts and rusty sides, could not be a dandy Boston\nIndiaman.  As they drew nearer, we soon discovered the high poop\nand top-gallant forecastle, and other marks of the Italian ship Rosa,\nand the brig proved to be the Catalina, which we saw at Santa Barbara,\njust arrived from Valparaiso.  They came to anchor, moored ship,\nand commenced discharging hides and tallow.  The Rosa had purchased\nthe house occupied by the Lagoda, and the Catalina took the other\nspare one between ours and the Ayacucho’s, so that, now, each one\nwas occupied, and the beach, for several days, was all alive.\nThe Catalina had several Kanakas on board, who were immediately\nbesieged by the others, and carried up to the oven, where they had\na long pow-wow, and a smoke.  Two Frenchmen, who belonged to the\nRosa’s crew, came in, every evening, to see Nicholas; and from them\nwe learned that the Pilgrim was at San Pedro, and was the only other\nvessel now on the coast.  Several of the Italians slept on shore at\ntheir hide-house; and there, and at the tent in which the Fazio’s\ncrew lived, we had some very good singing almost every evening.\nThe Italians sang a variety of songs–barcarollas, provincial airs,\netc.; in several of which I recognized parts of our favorite operas\nand sentimental songs.  They often joined in a song, taking all the\ndifferent parts; which produced a fine effect, as many of them had good\nvoices, and all seemed to sing with spirit and feeling.  One young\nman, in particular, had a falsetto as clear as a clarionet.",
        "The greater part of the crews of the vessels came ashore every\nevening, and we passed the time in going about from one house to\nanother, and listening to all manner of languages.  The Spanish was\nthe common ground upon which we all met; for every one knew more or\nless of that.  We had now, out of forty or fifty, representatives\nfrom almost every nation under the sun: two Englishmen, three Yankees,\ntwo Scotchmen, two Welshmen, one Irishman, three Frenchmen (two of\nwhom were Normans, and the third from Gascony,) one Dutchman,\none Austrian, two or three Spaniards, (from old Spain,) half a\ndozen Spanish-Americans and half-breeds, two native Indians from\nChili and the Island of Chiloe, one Negro, one Mulatto, about twenty\nItalians, from all parts of Italy, as many more Sandwich Islanders,\none Otaheitan, and one Kanaka from the Marquesas Islands.",
        "The night before the vessels were ready to sail, all the\nEuropeans united and had an entertainment at the Rosa’s hide-house,\nand we had songs of every nation and tongue.  A German gave us\n\"Och! mein lieber Augustin!” the three Frenchmen roared through the\nMarseilles Hymn; the English and Scotchmen gave us “Rule Britannia,\"\nand “Wha’ll be King but Charlie?” the Italians and Spaniards screamed\nthrough some national affairs, for which I was none the wiser;\nand we three Yankees made an attempt at the “Star-spangled Banner.\"\nAfter these national tributes had been paid, the Austrian gave us\na very pretty little love-song, and the Frenchmen sang a spirited\nthing called “Sentinelle! O prenez garde a vous!” and then\nfollowed the melange which might have been expected.  When I\nleft them, the aguardiente and annisou was pretty well in their\nheads, and they were all singing and talking at once, and their\npeculiar national oaths were getting as plenty as pronouns.",
        "The next day, the two vessels got under weigh for the windward,\nand left us in quiet possession of the beach.  Our numbers were\nsomewhat enlarged by the opening of the new houses, and the society\nof the beach a little changed.  In charge of the Catalina’s house,\nwas an old Scotchman, who, like most of his countrymen, had a pretty\ngood education, and, like many of them, was rather pragmatical,\nand had a ludicrously solemn conceit.  He employed his time in\ntaking care of his pigs, chickens, turkeys, dogs, etc., and in\nsmoking his long pipe.  Everything was as neat as a pin in the\nhouse, and he was as regular in his hours as a chronometer, but as\nhe kept very much by himself, was not a great addition to our\nsociety.  He hardly spent a cent all the time he was on the beach,\nand the others said he was no shipmate.  He had been a petty officer\non board the British frigate Dublin, Capt. Lord James Townshend,\nand had great ideas of his own importance.  The man in charge\nof the Rosa’s house was an Austrian by birth, but spoke, read,\nand wrote four languages with ease and correctness.  German was his\nnative tongue, but being born near the borders of Italy, and having\nsailed out of Genoa, the Italian was almost as familiar to him as\nhis own language.  He was six years on board of an English man-of-war,\nwhere he learned to speak our language with ease, and also to read\nand write it.  He had been several years in Spanish vessels,\nand had acquired that language so well, that he could read any\nbooks in it.  He was between forty and fifty years of age, and was\na singular mixture of the man-of-war’s-man and Puritan.  He talked\na great deal about propriety and steadiness, and gave good advice\nto the youngsters and Kanakas, but seldom went up to the town,\nwithout coming down “three sheets in the wind.”  One holyday, he\nand old Robert (the Scotchman from the Catalina) went up to the\ntown, and got so cozy, talking over old stories and giving one\nanother good advice, that they came down double-backed, on a horse,\nand both rolled off into the sand as soon as the horse stopped.\nThis put an end to their pretensions, and they never heard the last\nof it from the rest of the men.  On the night of the entertainment\nat the Rosa’s house, I saw old Schmidt, (that was the Austrian’s name)\nstanding up by a hogshead, holding on by both hands, and calling out\nto himself–\"Hold on, Schmidt! hold on, my good fellow, or you’ll\nbe on your back!”  Still, he was an intelligent, good-natured old\nfellow, and had a chest-full of books, which he willingly lent\nme to read.  In the same house with him was a Frenchman and an\nEnglishman; the latter a regular-built “man-of-war Jack;” a thorough\nseaman; a hearty, generous fellow; and, at the same time, a drunken,\ndissolute dog.  He made it a point to get drunk once a fortnight,\n(when he always managed to sleep on the road, and have his money\nstolen from him,) and to battle the Frenchman once a week.\nThese, with a Chilian, and a half a dozen Kanakas, formed the\naddition to our company.",
        "In about six weeks from the time when the Pilgrim sailed, we had\ngot all the hides which she left us cured and stowed away;\nand having cleared up the ground, and emptied the vats, and set\neverything in order, had nothing more to do until she should come\ndown again, but to supply ourselves with wood.  Instead of going\ntwice a week for this purpose, we determined to give one whole\nweek to getting wood, and then we should have enough to last us\nhalf through the summer.  Accordingly, we started off every morning,\nafter an early breakfast, with our hatchets in hand, and cut wood\nuntil the sun was over the point,–which was our only mark of time,\nas there was not a watch on the beach–and then came back to dinner,\nand after dinner, started off again with our hand-cart and ropes,\nand carted and “backed” it down, until sunset.  This, we kept up for\na week, until we had collected several cords,–enough to last us for\nsix or eight weeks–when we “knocked off\" altogether, much to my joy;\nfor, though I liked straying in the woods, and cutting, very well,\nyet the backing the wood for so great a distance, over an uneven\ncountry, was, without exception, the hardest work I had ever done.\nI usually had to kneel down and contrive to heave the load, which\nwas well strapped together, upon my back, and then rise up and\nstart off with it up the hills and down the vales, sometimes through\nthickets,–the rough points sticking into the skin, and tearing the\nclothes, so that, at the end of the week, I had hardly a whole shirt\nto my back.",
        "We were now through all our work, and had nothing more to do until\nthe Pilgrim should come down again.  We had nearly got through\nour provisions too, as well as our work; for our officer had\nbeen very wasteful of them, and the tea, flour, sugar, and molasses,\nwere all gone.  We suspected him of sending them up to the town;\nand he always treated the squaws with molasses, when they came\ndown to the beach.  Finding wheat-coffee and dry bread rather\npoor living, we dubbed together, and I went up to the town on\nhorseback with a great salt-bag behind the saddle, and a few reáls\nin my pocket, and brought back the bag full of onions, pears, beans,\nwater-melons, and other fruits; for the young woman who tended\nthe garden, finding that I belonged to the American ship, and that\nwe were short of provisions, put in a double portion.  With these\nwe lived like fighting-cocks for a week or two, and had, besides,\nwhat the sailors call “a blow-out on sleep;” not turning out in the\nmorning until breakfast was ready.  I employed several days in\noverhauling my chest, and mending up all my old clothes, until I\nhad got everything in order–patch upon patch, like a sand-barge’s\nmainsail.  Then I took hold of Bowditch’s Navigator, which I had\nalways with me.  I had been through the greater part of it, and now\nwent carefully through it, from beginning to end working out most\nof the examples.  That done, and there being no signs of the Pilgrim,\nI made a descent upon old Schmidt, and borrowed and read all the\nbooks there were upon the beach.  Such a dearth was there of these\nlatter articles, that anything, even a little child’s story-book,\nor the half of a shipping calendar, appeared like a treasure.\nI actually read a jest-book through, from beginning to end, in one\nday, as I should a novel, and enjoyed it very much.  At last,\nwhen I thought that there were no more to be got, I found, at the\nbottom of old Schmidt’s chest, “Mandeville, a Romance, by Godwin,\nin five volumes.”  This I had never read, but Godwin’s name was enough,\nand after the wretched trash I had devoured, anything bearing the name\nof a distinguished intellectual man, was a prize indeed.  I bore it off,\nand for two days I was up early and late, reading with all my might,\nand actually drinking in delight.  It is no extravagance to say that\nit was like a spring in a desert land.",
        "From the sublime to the ridiculous–so with me, from Mandeville\nto hide-curing, was but a step; for",
        "Wednesday, July 18th, brought us the brig Pilgrim from the windward.\nAs she came in, we found that she was a good deal altered in her\nappearance.  Her short top-gallant masts were up; her bowlines all\nunrove (except to the courses); the quarter boom-irons off her lower\nyards; her jack-cross-trees sent down; several blocks got rid of;\nrunning-rigging rove in new places; and numberless other changes\nof the same character.  Then, too, there was a new voice giving orders,\nand a new face on the quarter-deck,–a short, dark-complexioned man,\nin a green jacket and a high leather cap.  These changes, of course,\nset the whole beach on the qui-vive, and we were all waiting for the\nboat to come ashore, that we might have things explained.  At length,\nafter the sails were furled and the anchor carried out, the boat\npulled ashore, and the news soon flew that the expected ship had\narrived at Santa Barbara, and that Captain T––- had taken command\nof her, and her captain, Faucon, had taken the Pilgrim, and was the\ngreen-jacketed man on the quarter-deck.  The boat put directly off\nagain, without giving us time to ask any more questions, and we were\nobliged to wait till night, when we took a little skiff, that lay on\nthe beach, and paddled off.  When I stepped aboard, the second mate\ncalled me aft, and gave me a large bundle, directed to me, and marked\n\"Ship Alert.”  This was what I had longed for, yet I refrained from\nopening it until I went ashore.  Diving down into the forecastle,\nI found the same old crew, and was really glad to see them again.\nNumerous inquiries passed as to the new ship, the latest news from\nBoston, etc., etc.  S––- had received letters from home, and nothing\nremarkable had happened.  The Alert was agreed on all hands to be a\nfine ship, and a large one: “Larger than the Rosa\"–\"Big enough to\ncarry off all the hides in California\"–\"Rail as high as a man’s\nhead\"–\"A crack ship\"–\"A regular dandy,” etc., etc.  Captain\nT––- took command of her, and she went directly up to Monterey;\nfrom thence she was to go to San Francisco, and probably would not\nbe in San Diego under two or three months.  Some of the Pilgrim’s\ncrew found old ship-mates aboard of her, and spent an hour or two\nin her forecastle, the evening before she sailed.  They said her\ndecks were as white as snow–holystoned every morning, like a\nman-of-war’s; everything on board “shipshape and Bristol fashion;\"\na fine crew, three mates, a sailmaker and carpenter, and all complete.\n\"They’ve got a man for mate of that ship, and not a bloody sheep\nabout decks!\"–\"A mate that knows his duty, and makes everybody\ndo theirs, and won’t be imposed upon either by captain or crew.\"\nAfter collecting all the information we could get on this point,\nwe asked something about their new captain.  He had hardly been\non board long enough for them to know much about him, but he had\ntaken hold strong, as soon as he took command;–sending down the\ntop-gallant masts, and unreeving half the rigging, the very first\nday.",
        "Having got all the news we could, we pulled ashore; and as soon as\nwe reached the house, I, as might be supposed, proceeded directly\nto opening my bundle, and found a reasonable supply of duck,\nflannel shirts, shoes, etc., and, what was still more valuable,\na packet of eleven letters.  These I sat up nearly all the night\nto read, and put them carefully away, to be read and re-read again\nand again at my leisure.  Then came a half a dozen newspapers,\nthe last of which gave notice of Thanksgiving, and of the clearance\nof “ship Alert, Edward H. Faucon, master, for Callao and California,\nby Bryant, Sturgis & Co.”  No one has ever been on distant voyages,\nand after a long absence received a newspaper from home, who cannot\nunderstand the delight that they give one.  I read every part of them\n–the houses to let; things lost or stolen; auction sales, and all.\nNothing carries you so entirely to a place, and makes you feel so\nperfectly at home, as a newspaper.  The very name of “Boston Daily\nAdvertiser” “sounded hospitably upon the ear.”",
        "The Pilgrim discharged her hides, which set us at work again,\nand in a few days we were in the old routine of dry hides–wet\nhides–cleaning–beating, etc.  Captain Faucon came quietly up to\nme, as I was at work, with my knife, cutting the meat from a dirty\nhide, asked me how I liked California, and repeated–\"Tityre, tu\npatulae recubans sub tegmine fagi.”  Very apropos, thought I, and,\nat the same time, serves to show that you understand Latin.\nHowever, a kind word from a captain is a thing not to be slighted;\nso I answered him civilly, and made the most of it.",
        "Saturday, July 11th.  The Pilgrim set sail for the windward, and left\nus to go on in our old way.  Having laid in such a supply of wood,\nand the days being now long, and invariably pleasant, we had a\ngood deal of time to ourselves.  All the duck I received from home,\nI soon made up into trowsers and frocks, and displayed, every Sunday,\na complete suit of my own make, from head to foot, having formed\nthe remnants of the duck into a cap.  Reading, mending, sleeping,\nwith occasional excursions into the bush, with the dogs, in search\nof coati, hares, and rabbits, or to encounter a rattlesnake, and now\nand then a visit to the Presidio, filled up our spare time after\nhide-curing was over for the day.  Another amusement, which we\nsometimes indulged in, was “burning the water” for craw-fish.\nFor this purpose, we procured a pair of grains, with a long staff\nlike a harpoon, and making torches with tarred rope twisted round a\nlong pine stick, took the only boat on the beach, a small skiff,\nand with a torch-bearer in the bow, a steersman in the stern, and one\nman on each side with the grains, went off, on dark nights, to burn\nthe water.  This is fine sport.  Keeping within a few rods of the\nshore, where the water is not more than three or four feet deep,\nwith a clear sandy bottom, the torches light everything up so that one\ncould almost have seen a pin among the grains of sand.  The craw-fish\nare an easy prey, and we used soon to get a load of them.  The other\nfish were more difficult to catch, yet we frequently speared a number\nof them, of various kinds and sizes.  The Pilgrim brought us down\na supply of fish-hooks, which we had never had before, on the beach,\nand for several days we went down to the Point, and caught a\nquantity of cod and mackerel.  On one of these expeditions, we saw\na battle between two Sandwich Islanders and a shark.  “Johnny\"\nhad been playing about our boat for some time, driving away the\nfish, and showing his teeth at our bait, when we missed him, and in\na few moments heard a great shouting between two Kanakas who were\nfishing on the rock opposite to us: “E hana hana make i ka ia nui!\"\n\"E pii mai Aikane!” etc., etc.; and saw them pulling away on a stout\nline, and “Johnny Shark” floundering at the other end.  The line\nsoon broke; but the Kanakas would not let him off so easily,\nand sprang directly into the water after him.  Now came the tug of\nwar.  Before we could get into deep water, one of them seized him\nby the tail, and ran up with him upon the beach; but Johnny\ntwisted round, turning his head under his body, and, showing his\nteeth in the vicinity of the Kanaka’s hand, made him let go and\nspring out of the way.  The shark now turned tail and made the\nbest of his way, by flapping and floundering, toward deep water;\nbut here again, before he was fairly off, the other Kanaka seized\nhim by the tail, and made a spring towards the beach, his companion\nat the same time paying away upon him with stones and a large stick.\nAs soon, however, as the shark could turn, he was obliged to let go\nhis hold; but the instant he made toward deep water, they were both\nbehind him, watching their chance to seize him.  In this way the\nbattle went on for some time, the shark, in a rage, splashing and\ntwisting about, and the Kanakas, in high excitement, yelling at the\ntop of their voices; but the shark at last got off, carrying away a\nhook and liner and not a few severe bruises.",
        "We kept up a constant connection with the Presidio, and by the close\nof the summer I had added much to my vocabulary, beside having made\nthe acquaintance of nearly everybody in the place, and acquired some\nknowledge of the character and habits of the people, as well as of\nthe institutions under which they live.",
        "California was first discovered in 1536, by Cortes, and was subsequently\nvisited by numerous other adventurers as well as commissioned voyagers\nof the Spanish crown.  It was found to be inhabited by numerous tribes\nof Indians, and to be in many parts extremely fertile; to which, of course,\nwas added rumors of gold mines, pearl fishery, etc.  No sooner was the\nimportance of the country known, than the Jesuits obtained leave to\nestablish themselves in it, to Christianize and enlighten the Indians.\nThey established missions in various parts of the country toward the\nclose of the seventeenth century, and collected the natives about them,\nbaptizing them into the church, and teaching them the arts of civilized\nlife.  To protect the Jesuits in their missions, and at the same time\nto support the power of the crown over the civilized Indians, two\nforts were erected and garrisoned, one at San Diego, and the other\nat Monterey.  These were called Presidios, and divided the command of\nthe whole country between them.  Presidios have since been established\nat Santa Barbara and San Francisco; thus dividing the country into\nfour large districts, each with its presidio, and governed by the\ncommandant.  The soldiers, for the most part, married civilized\nIndians; and thus, in the vicinity of each presidio, sprung up,\ngradually, small towns.  In the course of time, vessels began to\ncome into the ports to trade with the missions, and received hides\nin return; and thus began the great trade of California.  Nearly all\nthe cattle in the country belonged to the missions, and they employed\ntheir Indians, who became, in fact, their slaves, in tending their\nvast herds.  In the year 1793, when Vancouver visited San Diego,\nthe mission had obtained great wealth and power, and are accused of\nhaving depreciated the country with the sovereign, that they might\nbe allowed to retain their possessions.  On the expulsion of the\nJesuits from the Spanish dominions, the missions passed into the\nhands of the Franciscans, though without any essential change in\ntheir management.  Ever since the independence of Mexico, the missions\nhave been going down; until, at last, a law was passed, stripping them\nof all their possessions, and confining the priests to their spiritual\nduties; and at the same time declaring all the Indians free and independent\nRancheros.  The change in the condition of the Indians was, as may be\nsupposed, only nominal: they are virtually slaves, as much as they\never were.  But in the missions, the change was complete.  The priests\nhave now no power, except in their religious character, and the great\npossessions of the missions are given over to be preyed upon by the\nharpies of the civil power, who are sent there in the capacity of\nadministradores, to settle up the concerns; and who usually end,\nin a few years, by making themselves fortunes, and leaving their\nstewardships worse than they found them.  The dynasty of the priests\nwas much more acceptable to the people of the country, and indeed,\nto every one concerned with the country, by trade or otherwise,\nthan that of the administradores.  The priests were attached\nperpetually to one mission, and felt the necessity of keeping up\nits credit.  Accordingly, their debts were regularly paid, and the\npeople were, in the main, well treated, and attached to those who\nhad spent their whole lives among them. But the administradores are\nstrangers sent from Mexico, having no interest in the country;\nnot identified in any way with their charge, and, for the most\npart, men of desperate fortunes–broken down politicians and\nsoldiers–whose only object is to retrieve their condition in\nas short a time as possible.  The change had been made but a few\nyears before our arrival upon the coast, yet, in that short time,\nthe trade was much diminished, credit impaired, and the venerable\nmissions going rapidly to decay.  The external arrangements remain\nthe same.  There are four presidios, having under their protection\nthe various missions, and pueblos, which are towns formed by the\ncivil power, and containing no mission or presidio.  The most\nnortherly presidio is San Francisco; the next Monterey; the next\nSanta Barbara; including the mission of the same, St. Louis Obispo,\nand St. Buenaventura, which is the finest mission in the whole\ncountry, having very fertile soil and rich vineyards.  The last,\nand most southerly, is San Diego, including the mission of the same,\nSan Juan Campestrano, the Pueblo de los Angelos, the largest town in\nCalifornia, with the neighboring mission of San Gabriel.  The priests\nin spiritual matters are subject to the Archbishop of Mexico, and in\ntemporal matters to the governor-general, who is the great civil and\nmilitary head of the country.",
        "The government of the country is an arbitrary democracy; having no\ncommon law, and no judiciary.  Their only laws are made and unmade at\nthe caprice of the legislature, and are as variable as the legislature\nitself.  They pass through the form of sending representatives to the\ncongress at Mexico, but as it takes several months to go and return,\nand there is very little communication between the capital and this\ndistant province, a member usually stays there, as permanent member,\nknowing very well that there will be revolutions at home before he\ncan write and receive an answer; if another member should be sent,\nhe has only to challenge him, and decide the contested election in\nthat way.",
        "Revolutions are matters of constant occurrence in California.\nThey are got up by men who are at the foot of the ladder and in\ndesperate circumstances, just as a new political party is started\nby such men in our own country.  The only object, of course, is the\nloaves and fishes; and instead of caucusing, paragraphing, libelling,\nfeasting, promising, and lying, as with us, they take muskets and\nbayonets, and seizing upon the presidio and custom-house, divide the\nspoils, and declare a new dynasty.  As for justice, they know no law\nbut will and fear.  A Yankee, who had been naturalized, and become a\nCatholic, and had married in the country, was sitting in his house at\nthe Pueblo de los Angelos, with his wife and children, when a Spaniard,\nwith whom he had had a difficulty, entered the house, and stabbed\nhim to the heart before them all.  The murderer was seized by some\nYankees who had settled there, and kept in confinement until a\nstatement of the whole affair could be sent to the governor-general.\nHe refused to do anything about it, and the countrymen of the\nmurdered man, seeing no prospect of justice being administered,\nmade known that if nothing was done, they should try the man\nthemselves.  It chanced that, at this time, there was a company\nof forty trappers and hunters from Kentucky, with their rifles,\nwho had made their head-quarters at the Pueblo; and these,\ntogether with the Americans and Englishmen in the place, who were\nbetween twenty and thirty in number, took possession of the town,\nand waiting a reasonable time, proceeded to try the man according to\nthe forms in their own country.  A judge and jury were appointed,\nand he was tried, convicted, sentenced to be shot, and carried out\nbefore the town, with his eyes blindfolded.  The names of all\nthe men were then put into a hat and each one pledging himself\nto perform his duty, twelve names were drawn out, and the men\ntook their stations with their rifles, and, firing at the word,\nlaid him dead.  He was decently buried, and the place was restored\nquietly to the proper authorities.  A general, with titles enough\nfor an hidalgo, was at San Gabriel, and issued a proclamation\nas long as the fore-top-bowline, threatening destruction to\nthe rebels, but never stirred from his fort; for forty Kentucky\nhunters, with their rifles, were a match for a whole regiment of\nhungry, drawling, lazy half-breeds.  This affair happened while\nwe were at San Pedro, (the port of the Pueblo,) and we had all\nthe particulars directly from those who were on the spot.  A few\nmonths afterwards, another man, whom we had often seen in San Diego,\nmurdered a man and his wife on the high road between the Pueblo and\nSan Louis Rey, and the foreigners not feeling themselves called upon\nto act in this case, the parties being all natives, nothing was done\nabout it; and I frequently afterwards saw the murderer in San Diego,\nwhere he was living with his wife and family.",
        "When a crime has been committed by Indians, justice, or rather\nvengeance, is not so tardy.  One Sunday afternoon, while I was\nat San Diego, an Indian was sitting on his horse, when another,\nwith whom he had had some difficulty, came up to him, drew a long knife,\nand plunged it directly into the horse’s heart.  The Indian sprang\nfrom his falling horse, drew out the knife, and plunged it into\nthe other Indian’s breast, over his shoulder, and laid him dead.\nThe poor fellow was seized at once, clapped into the calabozo,\nand kept there until an answer could be received from Monterey.\nA few weeks afterwards, I saw the poor wretch, sitting on the\nbare ground, in front of the calabozo, with his feet chained to\na stake, and handcuffs about his wrists.  I knew there was very\nlittle hope for him.  Although the deed was done in hot blood,\nthe horse on which he was sitting being his own, and a great\nfavorite, yet he was an Indian, and that was enough.  In about a\nweek after I saw him, I heard that he had been shot.  These few\ninstances will serve to give one a notion of the distribution of\njustice in California.",
        "In their domestic relations, these people are no better than in their\npublic.  The men are thriftless, proud, and extravagant, and very\nmuch given to gaming; and the women have but little education,\nand a good deal of beauty, and their morality, of course, is none of\nthe best; yet the instances of infidelity are much less frequent than\none would at first suppose.  In fact, one vice is set over against\nanother; and thus, something like a balance is obtained.  The women\nhave but little virtue, but then the jealousy of their husbands is\nextreme, and their revenge deadly and almost certain.  A few inches\nof cold steel has been the punishment of many an unwary man, who has\nbeen guilty, perhaps, of nothing more than indiscretion of manner.\nThe difficulties of the attempt are numerous, and the consequences\nof discovery fatal.  With the unmarried women, too, great watchfulness\nis used.  The main object of the parents is to marry their daughters\nwell, and to this, the slightest slip would be fatal.  The sharp eyes\nof a dueña, and the cold steel of a father or brother, are a protection\nwhich the characters of most of them–men and women–render by no means\nuseless; for the very men who would lay down their lives to avenge the\ndishonor of their own family, would risk the same lives to complete\nthe dishonor of another.",
        "Of the poor Indians, very little care is taken.  The priests,\nindeed, at the missions, are said to keep them very strictly,\nand some rules are usually made by the alcaldes to punish their\nmisconduct; but it all amounts to but little.  Indeed, to show the\nentire want of any sense of morality or domestic duty among them,\nI have frequently known an Indian to bring his wife, to whom he\nwas lawfully married in the church, down to the beach, and carry\nher back again, dividing with her the money which she had got\nfrom the sailors.  If any of the girls were discovered by the\nalcalde to be open evil-livers, they were whipped, and kept at\nwork sweeping the square of the presidio, and carrying mud and\nbricks for the buildings; yet a few reáls would generally buy\nthem off.  Intemperance, too, is a common vice among the Indians.\nThe Spaniards, on the contrary, are very abstemious, and I do not\nremember ever having seen a Spaniard intoxicated.",
        "Such are the people who inhabit a country embracing four or five\nhundred miles of sea-coast, with several good harbors; with fine\nforests in the north; the waters filled with fish, and the plains\ncovered with thousands of herds of cattle; blessed with a climate,\nthan which there can be no better in the world; free from all\nmanner of diseases, whether epidemic or endemic; and with a soil\nin which corn yields from seventy to eighty fold.  In the hands\nof an enterprising people, what a country this might be! we are\nready to say.  Yet how long would a people remain so, in such a\ncountry?  The Americans (as those from the United States are\ncalled) and Englishmen, who are fast filling up the principal\ntowns, and getting the trade into their hands, are indeed more\nindustrious and effective than the Spaniards; yet their children\nare brought up Spaniards, in every respect, and if the “California\nfever” (laziness) spares the first generation, it always attacks\nthe second.",
        "Saturday, July 18th.  This day, sailed the Mexican hermaphrodite brig,\nFazio, for San Blas and Mazatlan.  This was the brig which was driven\nashore at San Pedro in a south-easter, and had been lying at San Diego\nto repair and take in her cargo.  The owner of her had had a good deal\nof difficulty with the government about the duties, etc., and her\nsailing had been delayed for several weeks; but everything having been\narranged, she got under weigh with a light breeze, and was floating\nout of the harbor, when two horsemen came dashing down to the beach,\nat full speed, and tried to find a boat to put off after her; but there\nbeing none on the beach, they offered a handful of silver to any Kanaka\nwho would swim off and take a letter on board.  One of the Kanakas,\na fine, active, well-made young fellow, instantly threw off everything\nbut his duck trowsers, and putting the letter into his hat, swam off,\nafter the vessel.  Fortunately, the wind was very light and the\nvessel was going slowly, so that, although she was nearly a mile\noff when he started, he gained on her rapidly.  He went through the\nwater leaving a wake like a small steamboat.  I certainly never saw\nsuch swimming before.  They saw him coming from the deck, but did\nnot heave-to, suspecting the nature of his errand; yet, the wind\ncontinuing light, he swam alongside and got on board, and delivered\nhis letter.  The captain read the letter, told the Kanaka there was no\nanswer, and giving him a glass of brandy, left him to jump overboard\nand find the best of his way to the shore.  The Kanaka swam in for\nthe nearest point of land, and, in about an hour, made his appearance\nat the hide-house.  He did not seem at all fatigued, had made three\nor four dollars, got a glass of brandy, and was in fine spirits.\nThe brig kept on her course, and the government officers, who had\ncome down to forbid her sailing, went back, each with something\nlike a flea in his ear, having depended upon extorting a little\nmore money from the owner.",
        "It was now nearly three months since the Alert arrived at Santa \nBarbara, and we began to expect her daily.  About a half a mile\nbehind the hide-house, was a high hill; and every afternoon,\nas soon as we had done our work, some one of us walked up to see\nif there were any sail in sight, coming down before the regular trades,\nwhich blow every afternoon.  Each day, after the latter part of July,\nwe went up the hill, and came back disappointed.  I was anxious for\nher arrival, for I had been told by letter that the owners in Boston,\nat the request of my friends, had written to Captain T––- to take\nme on board the Alert, in case she returned to the United States\nbefore the Pilgrim; and I, of course, wished to know whether the\norder had been received, and what was the destination of the ship.\nOne year more or less might be of small consequence to others,\nbut it was everything to me.  It was now just a year since we sailed\nfrom Boston, and at the shortest, no vessel could expect to get away\nunder eight or nine months, which would make our absence two years in\nall.  This would be pretty long, but would not be fatal.  It would\nnot necessarily be decisive of my future life.  But one year more\nwould settle the matter.  I should be a sailor for life; and although\nI had made up my mind to it before I had my letters from home, and was,\nas I thought, quite satisfied; yet, as soon as an opportunity was\nheld out to me of returning, and the prospect of another kind of life\nwas opened to me, my anxiety to return, and, at least, to have the\nchance of deciding upon my course for myself, was beyond measure.\nBeside that, I wished to be “equal to either fortune,” and to qualify\nmyself for an officer’s berth, and a hide-house was no place to\nlearn seamanship in.  I had become experienced in hide-curing,\nand everything went on smoothly, and I had many opportunities of\nbecoming acquainted with the people, and much leisure for reading and\nstudying navigation; yet practical seamanship could only be got on\nboard ship; therefore, I determined to ask to be taken on board the\nship when she arrived.  By the first of August, we finished curing\nall our hides, stored them away, cleaned out our vats, (in which\nlatter work we spent two days, up to our knees in mud and the\nsediments of six months’ hide-curing, in a stench which would drive\na donkey from his breakfast,) and got in readiness for the arrival\nof the ship, and had another leisure interval of three or four weeks;\nwhich I spent, as usual, in reading, writing, studying, making and\nmending my clothes, and getting my wardrobe in complete readiness,\nin case I should go on board the ship; and in fishing, ranging the\nwoods with the dogs, and in occasional visits to the presidio and\nmission.  A good deal of my time was spent in taking care of a\nlittle puppy, which I had selected from thirty-six, that were born\nwithin three days of one another, at our house.  He was a fine,\npromising pup, with four white paws, and all the rest of his body\nof a dark brown.  I built a little kennel for him, and kept him\nfastened there, away from the other dogs, feeding and disciplining\nhim myself.  In a few weeks, I got him in complete subjection,\nand he grew finely, was very much attached to me, and bid fair\nto be one of the leading dogs on the beach.  I called him Bravo,\nand the only thing I regretted at the thought of leaving the beach,\nwas parting with him.",
        "Day after day, we went up the hill, but no ship was to be seen,\nand we began to form all sorts of conjectures as to her whereabouts;\nand the theme of every evening’s conversation at the different houses,\nand in our afternoon’s paséo upon the beach, was the ship–where\nshe could be–had she been to San Francisco?–how many hides she\nwould bring, etc., etc.",
        "Tuesday, August 25th.  This morning, the officer in charge of\nour house went off beyond the point a fishing, in a small canoe,\nwith two Kanakas; and we were sitting quietly in our room at the\nhide-house, when, just before noon, we heard a complete yell of\n\"Sail ho!” breaking out from all parts of the beach, at once,–from\nthe Kanakas’ oven to the Rosa’s house.  In an instant, every one\nwas out of his house; and there was a fine, tall ship, with royals\nand skysails set, bending over before the strong afternoon breeze,\nand coming rapidly round the point.  Her yards were braced sharp\nup; every sail was set, and drew well; the Yankee ensign was flying\nfrom her mizen-peak; and having the tide in her favor, she came up\nlike a race-horse.  It was nearly six months since a new vessel had\nentered San Diego, and of course, every one was on the qui-vive.\nShe certainly made a fine appearance.  Her light sails were taken\nin, as she passed the low, sandy tongue of land, and clewing up her\nhead sails, she rounded handsomely to, under her mizen topsail,\nand let go the anchor at about a cable’s length from the shore.\nIn a few minutes, the topsail yards were manned, and all three\nof the topsails furled at once.  From the fore top-gallant yard,\nthe men slid down the stay to furl the jib, and from the mizen\ntop-gallant yard, by the stay, into the maintop, and thence to\nthe yard; and the men on the topsail yards came down the lifts\nto the yard-arms of the courses.  The sails were furled with\ngreat care, the bunts triced up by jiggers, and the jibs stowed\nin cloth.  The royal yards were then struck, tackles got upon the\nyard-arms and the stay, the long-boat hoisted out, a large anchor\ncarried astern, and the ship moored.  Then the captain’s gig was\nlowered away from the quarter, and a boat’s crew of fine lads,\nbetween the ages of fourteen and eighteen, pulled the captain\nashore.  The gig was a light whale-boat, handsomely painted,\nand fitted up with cushions, etc., in the stern sheets.\nWe immediately attacked the boat’s crew, and got very thick\nwith them in a few minutes.  We had much to ask about Boston,\ntheir passage out, etc., and they were very curious to know about\nthe life we were leading upon the beach.  One of them offered to\nexchange with me; which was just what I wanted; and we had only\nto get the permission of the captain.",
        "After dinner, the crew began discharging their hides, and, as we\nhad nothing to do at the hide-houses, we were ordered aboard to\nhelp them.  I had now my first opportunity of seeing the ship which\nI hoped was to be my home for the next year.  She looked as well\non board as she did from without.  Her decks were wide and roomy,\n(there being no poop, or house on deck, which disfigures the after\npart of most of our vessels,) flush, fore and aft, and as white as\nsnow, which the crew told us was from constant use of holystones.\nThere was no foolish gilding and gingerbread work, to take the eye\nof landsmen and passengers, but everything was “ship-shape and\nBristol fashion.”  There was no rust, no dirt, no rigging hanging\nslack, no fag ends of ropes and “Irish pendants” aloft, and the\nyards were squared “to a t” by lifts and braces.",
        "The mate was a fine, hearty, noisy fellow, with a voice like a lion,\nand always wide awake.  He was “a man, every inch of him,” as the\nsailors said; and though “a bit of a horse,” and “a hard customer,\"\nyet he was generally liked by the crew.  There was also a second and\nthird mate, a carpenter, sailmaker, steward, cook, etc., and twelve,\nincluding boys, before the mast.  She had, on board, seven thousand\nhides, which she had collected at the windward, and also horns\nand tallow.  All these we began discharging, from both gangways\nat once, into the two boats, the second mate having charge of\nthe launch, and the third mate of the pinnace.  For several days,\nwe were employed in this way, until all the hides were taken out,\nwhen the crew began taking in ballast, and we returned to our old\nwork, hide-curing.",
        "Saturday, Aug. 29th.  Arrived, brig Catalina, from the windward. ",
        "Sunday, 30th.  This was the first Sunday that the crew had been\nin San Diego, and of course they were all for going up to see\nthe town.  The Indians came down early, with horses to let for\nthe day, and all the crew, who could obtain liberty, went off\nto the Presidio and mission, and did not return until night.\nI had seen enough of San Diego, and went on board and spent\nthe day with some of the crew, whom I found quietly at work in\nthe forecastle, mending and washing their clothes, and reading\nand writing.  They told me that the ship stopped at Callao in\nthe passage out, and there lay three weeks.  She had a passage\nof little over eighty days from Boston to Callao, which is one of\nthe shortest on record.  There, they left the Brandywine frigate,\nand other smaller American ships of war, and the English frigate\nBlonde, and a French seventy-four.  From Callao they came directly\nto California, and had visited every port on the coast, including\nSan Francisco.  The forecastle in which they lived was large,\ntolerably well lighted by bulls-eyes, and, being kept perfectly clean,\nhad quite a comfortable appearance; at least, it was far better than\nthe little, black, dirty hole in which I had lived so many months on\nboard the Pilgrim.  By the regulations of the ship, the forecastle\nwas cleaned out every morning, and the crew, being very neat, kept\nit clean by some regulations of their own, such as having a large\nspitbox always under the steps and between the bits, and obliging\nevery man to hang up his wet clothes, etc.  In addition to this,\nit was holystoned every Saturday morning.  In the after part of\nthe ship was a handsome cabin, a dining-room, and a trade-room,\nfitted out with shelves and furnished with all sorts of goods.\nBetween these and the forecastle was the “between-decks,” as high\nas the gun deck of a frigate; being six feet and a half, under the\nbeams.  These between-decks were holystoned regularly, and kept in\nthe most perfect order; the carpenter’s bench and tools being in\none part, the sailmaker’s in another, and boatswain’s locker,\nwith the spare rigging, in a third.  A part of the crew slept\nhere, in hammocks swung fore and aft from the beams, and triced up\nevery morning.  The sides of the between-decks were clapboarded,\nthe knees and stanchions of iron, and the latter made to unship.\nThe crew said she was as tight as a drum, and a fine sea boat,\nher only fault being, that of most fast ships,–that she was wet,\nforward.  When she was going, as she sometimes would, eight or\nnine knots on a wind, there would not be a dry spot forward of\nthe gangway.  The men told great stories of her sailing, and had\ngreat confidence in her as a “lucky ship.”  She was seven years\nold, and had always been in the Canton trade, and never had met\nwith an accident of any consequence, and had never made a passage\nthat was not shorter than the average.  The third mate, a young\nman of about eighteen years of age, nephew of one of the owners,\nhad been in the ship from a small boy, and “believed in the ship;\"\nand the chief mate thought more of her than he would of a wife and\nfamily.",
        "The ship lay about a week longer in port, when, having discharged\nher cargo and taken in ballast, she prepared to get under weigh.\nI now made my application to the captain to go on board.  He told\nme that I could go home in the ship when she sailed (which I knew\nbefore); and, finding that I wished to be on board while she was on\nthe coast, said he had no objection, if I could find one of my own\nage to exchange with me, for the time.  This, I easily accomplished,\nfor they were glad to change the scene by a few months on shore,\nand, moreover, escape the winter and the south-easters; and I went\non board the next day, with my chest and hammock, and found myself\nonce more afloat.",
        "Tuesday, Sept. 8th.  This was my first day’s duty on board the\nship; and though a sailor’s life is a sailor’s life wherever it\nmay be, yet I found everything very different here from the customs\nof the brig Pilgrim.  After all hands were called, at day-break,\nthree minutes and a half were allowed for every man to dress and\ncome on deck, and if any were longer than that, they were sure\nto be overhauled by the mate, who was always on deck, and making\nhimself heard all over the ship.  The head-pump was then rigged,\nand the decks washed down by the second and third mates; the chief\nmate walking the quarter-deck and keeping a general supervision,\nbut not deigning to touch a bucket or a brush.  Inside and out,\nfore and aft, upper deck and between decks, steerage and forecastle,\nrail, bulwarks, and water-ways, were washed, scrubbed and scraped\nwith brooms and canvas, and the decks were wet and sanded all\nover, and then holystoned.  The holystone is a large, soft stone,\nsmooth on the bottom, with long ropes attached to each end, by which\nthe crew keep it sliding fore and aft, over the wet, sanded decks.\nSmaller hand-stones, which the sailors call “prayer-books,” are used\nto scrub in among the crevices and narrow places, where the large\nholystone will not go.  An hour or two, we were kept at this work,\nwhen the head-pump was manned, and all the sand washed off the\ndecks and sides.  Then came swabs and squilgees; and after the\ndecks were dry, each one went to his particular morning job.\nThere were five boats belonging to the ship,–launch, pinnace,\njolly-boat, larboard quarter-boat, and gig,–each of which had a\ncoxswain, who had charge of it, and was answerable for the order\nand cleanness of it.  The rest of the cleaning was divided among\nthe crew; one having the brass and composition work about the capstan;\nanother the bell, which was of brass, and kept as bright as a\ngilt button; a third, the harness-cask; another, the man-rope\nstanchions; others, the steps of the forecastle and hatchways,\nwhich were hauled up and holystoned.  Each of these jobs must\nbe finished before breakfast; and, in the meantime, the rest\nof the crew filled the scuttle-butt, and the cook scraped his\nkids (wooden tubs out of which the sailors eat) and polished the\nhoops, and placed them before the galley, to await inspection.\nWhen the decks were dry, the lord paramount made his appearance\non the quarter-deck, and took a few turns, when eight bells\nwere struck, and all hands went to breakfast.  Half an hour\nwas allowed for breakfast, when all hands were called again;\nthe kids, pots, bread-bags, etc., stowed away; and, this morning,\npreparations were made for getting under weigh.  We paid out on the\nchain by which we swung; hove in on the other; catted the anchor;\nand hove short on the first.  This work was done in shorter time\nthan was usual on board the brig; for though everything was more\nthan twice as large and heavy, the cat-block being as much as a\nman could lift, and the chain as large as three of the Pilgrim’s,\nyet there was a plenty of room to move about in, more discipline\nand system, more men, and more good will.  Every one seemed ambitious\nto do his best: officers and men knew their duty, and all went well.\nAs soon as she was hove short, the mate, on the forecastle, gave the\norder to loose the sails, and, in an instant, every one sprung into\nthe rigging, up the shrouds, and out on the yards, scrambling by one\nanother,–the first up the best fellow,–cast off the yard-arm gaskets\nand bunt gaskets, and one man remained on each yard, holding the bunt\njigger with a turn round the tye, all ready to let go, while the rest\nlaid down to man the sheets and halyards. The mate then hailed the\nyards–\"All ready forward?\"–\"All ready the cross-jack yards?” etc.,\netc., and “Aye, aye, sir!” being returned from each, the word was\ngiven to let go; and in the twinkling of an eye, the ship, which\nhad shown nothing but her bare yards, was covered with her loose\ncanvas, from the royal-mast-heads to the decks.  Every one then\nlaid down, except one man in each top, to overhaul the rigging,\nand the topsails were hoisted and sheeted home; all three yards\ngoing to the mast-head at once, the larboard watch hoisting the\nfore, the starboard watch the main, and five light hands, (of whom\nI was one,) picked from the two watches, the mizen.  The yards were\nthen trimmed, the anchor weighed, the cat-block hooked on, the fall\nstretched out, manned by “all hands and the cook,” and the anchor\nbrought to the head with “cheerily men!” in full chorus.  The ship\nbeing now under weigh, the light sails were set, one after another,\nand she was under full sail, before she had passed the sandy point.\nThe fore royal, which fell to my lot, (being in the mate’s watch,)\nwas more than twice as large as that of the Pilgrim, and, though I\ncould handle the brig’s easily, I found my hands full, with this,\nespecially as there were no jacks to the ship; everything being for\nneatness, and nothing left for Jack to hold on by, but his eyelids.",
        "As soon as we were beyond the point, and all sail out, the order\nwas given, “Go below the watch!” and the crew said that, ever since\nthey had been on the coast, they had had “watch and watch,” while\ngoing from port to port; and, in fact, everything showed that,\nthough strict discipline was kept, and the utmost was required\nof every man, in the way of his duty, yet, on the whole, there\nwas very good usage on board.  Each one knew that he must be a\nman, and show himself smart when at his duty, yet every one was\nsatisfied with the usage; and a contented crew, agreeing with\none another, and finding no fault, was a contrast indeed with\nthe small, hard-used, dissatisfied, grumbling, desponding crew\nof the Pilgrim.",
        "It being the turn of our watch to go below, the men went to work,\nmending their clothes, and doing other little things for themselves;\nand I, having got my wardrobe in complete order at San Diego,\nhad nothing to do but to read.  I accordingly overhauled the\nchests of the crew, but found nothing that suited me exactly,\nuntil one of the men said he had a book which “told all about a\ngreat highway-man,” at the bottom of his chest, and producing it,\nI found, to my surprise and joy, that it was nothing else than\nBulwer’s Paul Clifford.  This, I seized immediately, and going\nto my hammock, lay there, swinging and reading, until the watch\nwas out.  The between-decks were clear, the hatchways open,\nand a cool breeze blowing through them, the ship under easy way,\nand everything comfortable.  I had just got well into the story,\nwhen eight bells were struck, and we were all ordered to dinner.\nAfter dinner came our watch on deck for four hours, and, at four\no’clock, I went below again, turned into my hammock, and read\nuntil the dog watch.  As no lights were allowed after eight o’clock,\nthere was no reading in the night watch.  Having light winds and\ncalms, we were three days on the passage, and each watch below,\nduring the daytime, I spent in the same manner, until I had\nfinished my book.  I shall never forget the enjoyment I derived\nfrom it.  To come across anything with the slightest claims to\nliterary merit, was so unusual, that this was a perfect feast to\nme.  The brilliancy of the book, the succession of capital hits,\nlively and characteristic sketches, kept me in a constant state of\npleasing sensations.  It was far too good for a sailor.  I could\nnot expect such fine times to last long.",
        "While on deck, the regular work of the ship went on.  The sailmaker\nand carpenter worked between decks, and the crew had their work to do\nupon the rigging, drawing yarns, making spun-yarn, etc., as usual in\nmerchantmen.  The night watches were much more pleasant than on board\nthe Pilgrim.  There, there were so few in a watch, that, one being at\nthe wheel, and another on the look-out, there was no one left to talk\nwith; but here, we had seven in a watch, so that we had long yarns,\nin abundance.  After two or three night watches, I became quite well\nacquainted with all the larboard watch.  The sailmaker was the head\nman of the watch, and was generally considered the most experienced\nseaman on board.  He was a thoroughbred old man-of-war’s-man, had\nbeen to sea twenty-two years, in all kinds of vessels–men-of-war,\nprivateers, slavers, and merchantmen;–everything except whalers,\nwhich a thorough sailor despises, and will always steer clear of,\nif he can.  He had, of course, been in all parts of the world,\nand was remarkable for drawing a long bow.  His yarns frequently\nstretched through a watch, and kept all hands awake.  They were\nalways amusing from their improbability, and, indeed, he never\nexpected to be believed, but spun them merely for amusement;\nand as he had some humor and a good supply of man-of-war slang\nand sailor’s salt phrases, he always made fun.  Next to him in\nage and experience, and, of course, in standing in the watch,\nwas an Englishman, named Harris, of whom I shall have more to\nsay hereafter.  Then, came two or three Americans, who had been\nthe common run of European and South American voyages, and one who\nhad been in a “spouter,” and, of course, had all the whaling stories\nto himself.  Last of all, was a broad-backed, thick-headed boy from\nCape Cod, who had been in mackerel schooners, and was making his\nfirst voyage in a square-rigged vessel.  He was born in Hingham,\nand of course was called “Bucketmaker.”  The other watch was composed of\nabout the same number.  A tall, fine-looking Frenchman, with coal-black\nwhiskers and curly hair, a first-rate seaman, and named John, (one name\nis enough for a sailor,) was the head man of the watch.  Then came two\nAmericans (one of whom had been a dissipated young man of property\nand family, and was reduced to duck trowsers and monthly wages,)\na German, an English lad, named Ben, who belonged on the mizen\ntopsail yard with me, and was a good sailor for his years, and two\nBoston boys just from the public schools.  The carpenter sometimes\nmustered in the starboard watch, and was an old sea-dog, a Swede\nby birth, and accounted the best helmsman in the ship.  This was\nour ship’s company, beside cook and steward, who were blacks,\nthree mates, and the captain.",
        "The second day out, the wind drew ahead, and we had to beat up\nthe coast; so that, in tacking ship, I could see the regulations\nof the vessel.  Instead of going wherever was most convenient,\nand running from place to place, wherever work was to be done,\neach man had his station.  A regular tacking and wearing bill\nwas made out.  The chief mate commanded on the forecastle, and had\ncharge of the head sails and the forward part of the ship.  Two of\nthe best men in the ship–the sailmaker from our watch, and John,\nthe Frenchman, from the other, worked the forecastle.  The third\nmate commanded in the waist, and, with the carpenter and one man,\nworked the main tack and bowlines; the cook, ex-officio, the fore\nsheet, and the steward the main.  The second mate had charge of\nthe after yards, and let go the lee fore and main braces.  I was\nstationed at the weather cross-jack braces; three other light\nhands at the lee; one boy at the spanker-sheet and guy; a man\nand a boy at the main topsail, top-gallant, and royal braces;\nand all the rest of the crew–men and boys–tallied on to the\nmain brace.  Every one here knew his station, must be there when\nall hands were called to put the ship about, and was answerable\nfor every rope committed to him.  Each man’s rope must be let\ngo and hauled in at the order, properly made fast, and neatly\ncoiled away when the ship was about.  As soon as all hands are at\ntheir stations, the captain, who stands on the weather side of the\nquarter-deck, makes a sign to the man at the wheel to put it down,\nand calls out “Helm’s a lee’!”  “Helm’s a lee’!” answers the mate on\nthe forecastle, and the head sheets are let go.  “Raise tacks and\nsheets!” says the captain; “tacks and sheets!” is passed forward,\nand the fore tack and main sheet are let go.  The next thing is to\nhaul taught for a swing.  The weather cross-jack braces and the lee\nmain braces are each belayed together upon two pins, and ready to\nbe let go; and the opposite braces hauled taught.  “Main topsail\nhaul!” shouts the captain; the braces are let go; and if he has\ntaken his time well, the yards swing round like a top; but if he\nis too late, or too soon, it is like drawing teeth.  The after\nyards are then braced up and belayed, the main sheet hauled aft,\nthe spanker eased over to leeward, and the men from the braces\nstand by the head yards.  “Let go and haul!” says the captain;\nthe second mate lets go the weather fore braces, and the men haul\nin to leeward.  The mate, on the forecastle, looks out for the\nhead yards.  “Well, the fore topsail yard!”  “Top-gallant yard’s\nwell!”  “Royal yard too much! Haul into windward! So! well that!\"\n\"Well all!”  Then the starboard watch board the main tack, and the\nlarboard watch lay forward and board the fore tack and haul down\nthe jib sheet, clapping a tackle upon it, if it blows very fresh.\nThe after yards are then trimmed, the captain generally looking\nout for them himself.  “Well the cross-jack yard!”  “Small pull the\nmain top-gallant yard!”  “Well that!”  “Well the mizen top-gallant\nyard!”  “Cross-jack yards all well!”  “Well all aft!”  “Haul taught\nto windward!”  Everything being now trimmed and in order, each man\ncoils up the rigging at his own station, and the order is given–\"Go\nbelow the watch!”",
        "During the last twenty-four hours of the passage, we beat off and\non the land, making a tack about once in four hours, so that I\nhad a sufficient opportunity to observe the working of the ship;\nand certainly, it took no more men to brace about this ship’s\nlower yards, which were more than fifty feet square, than it did\nthose of the Pilgrim, which were not much more than half the size;\nso much depends upon the manner in which the braces run, and the\nstate of the blocks; and Captain Wilson, of the Ayacucho, who was\nafterwards a passenger with us, upon a trip to windward, said he\nhad no doubt that our ship worked two men lighter than his brig.",
        "Friday, Sept. 11th.  This morning, at four o’clock, went below,\nSan Pedro point being about two leagues ahead, and the ship going\non under studding-sails.  In about an hour we were waked up by the\nhauling of the chain about decks, and in a few minutes “All hands\nahoy!” was called; and we were all at work, hauling in and making\nup the studding-sails, overhauling the chain forward, and getting\nthe anchors ready.  “The Pilgrim is there at anchor,” said some\none, as we were running about decks; and taking a moment’s look\nover the rail, I saw my old friend, deeply laden, lying at anchor\ninside of the kelp.  In coming to anchor, as well as in tacking,\neach one had his station and duty.  The light sails were clewed\nup and furled, the courses hauled up and the jibs down; then came\nthe topsails in the buntlines, and the anchor let go.  As soon as\nshe was well at anchor, all hands lay aloft to furl the topsails;\nand this, I soon found, was a great matter on board this ship;\nfor every sailor knows that a vessel is judged of, a good deal,\nby the furl of her sails.  The third mate, a sailmaker, and the\nlarboard watch went upon the fore topsail yard; the second mate,\ncarpenter, and the starboard watch upon the main; and myself\nand the English lad, and the two Boston boys, and the young\nCape-Cod man, furled the mizen topsail.  This sail belonged\nto us altogether, to reef and to furl, and not a man was allowed\nto come upon our yard.  The mate took us under his special care,\nfrequently making us furl the sail over, three or four times,\nuntil we got the bunt up to a perfect cone, and the whole sail\nwithout a wrinkle.  As soon as each sail was hauled up and the\nbunt made, the jigger was bent on to the slack of the buntlines,\nand the bunt triced up, on deck.  The mate then took his place\nbetween the knightheads to “twig” the fore, on the windlass to\ntwig the main, and at the foot of the mainmast, for the mizen;\nand if anything was wrong,–too much bunt on one side, clews too\ntaught or too slack, or any sail abaft the yard,–the whole must be\ndropped again.  When all was right, the bunts were triced well up,\nthe yard-arm gaskets passed, so as not to leave a wrinkle forward\nof the yard–short gaskets with turns close together.",
        "From the moment of letting go the anchor, when the captain ceases\nhis care of things, the chief mate is the great man.  With a voice\nlike a young lion, he was hallooing and bawling, in all directions,\nmaking everything fly, and, at the same time, doing everything well.\nHe was quite a contrast to the worthy, quiet, unobtrusive mate of the\nPilgrim; not so estimable a man, perhaps, but a far better mate\nof a vessel; and the entire change in Captain T––-’s conduct,\nsince he took command of the ship, was owing, no doubt, in a\ngreat measure, to this fact.  If the chief officer wants force,\ndiscipline slackens, everything gets out of joint, the captain\ninterferes continually; that makes a difficulty between them,\nwhich encourages the crew, and the whole ends in a three-sided\nquarrel.  But Mr. Brown (the mate of the Alert) wanted no help\nfrom anybody; took everything into his own hands; and was more\nlikely to encroach upon the authority of the master, than to\nneed any spurring.  Captain T––- gave his directions to the\nmate in private, and, except in coming to anchor, getting under\nweigh, tacking, reefing topsails, and other “all-hands-work,\"\nseldom appeared in person.  This is the proper state of things,\nand while this lasts, and there is a good understanding aft,\neverything will go on well.",
        "Having furled all the sails, the royal yards were next to be sent\ndown.  The English lad and myself sent down the main, which was\nlarger than the Pilgrim’s main top-gallant yard; two more light\nhands, the fore; and one boy, the mizen.  This order, we always\nkept while on the coast; sending them up and down every time we\ncame in and went out of port.  They were all tripped and lowered\ntogether, the main on the starboard side, and the fore and mizen,\nto port.  No sooner was she all snug, than tackles were got up\non the yards and stays, and the long-boat and pinnace hove out.\nThe swinging booms were then guyed out, and the boats made fast\nby geswarps, and everything in harbor style.  After breakfast,\nthe hatches were taken off, and all got ready to receive hides\nfrom the Pilgrim.  All day, boats were passing and repassing,\nuntil we had taken her hides from her, and left her in ballast\ntrim.  These hides made but little show in our hold, though they\nhad loaded the Pilgrim down to the water’s edge.  This changing\nof the hides settled the question of the destination of the two\nvessels, which had been one of some speculation to us.  We were\nto remain in the leeward ports, while the Pilgrim was to sail,\nthe next morning, for San Francisco.  After we had knocked off\nwork, and cleared up decks for the night, my friend S––- came\non board, and spent an hour with me in our berth between decks.\nThe Pilgrim’s crew envied me my place on board the ship, and seemed\nto think that I had got a little to windward of them; especially in\nthe matter of going home first.  S––- was determined to go home on\nthe Alert, by begging or buying; if Captain T––- would not let\nhim come on other terms, he would purchase an exchange with some\none of the crew.  The prospect of another year after the Alert\nshould sail, was rather “too much of the monkey.”  About seven\no’clock, the mate came down into the steerage, in fine trim for fun,\nroused the boys out of the berth, turned up the carpenter with his\nfiddle, sent the steward with lights to put in the between-decks,\nand set all hands to dancing.  The between-decks were high enough\nto allow of jumping; and being clear, and white, from holystoning,\nmade a fine dancing-hall.  Some of the Pilgrim’s crew were in the\nforecastle, and we all turned-to and had a regular sailor’s shuffle,\ntill eight bells.  The Cape-Cod boy could dance the true fisherman’s\njig, barefooted, knocking with his heels, and slapping the decks\nwith his bare feet, in time with the music.  This was a favorite\namusement of the mate’s, who always stood at the steerage door,\nlooking on, and if the boys would not dance, he hazed them round\nwith a rope’s end, much to the amusement of the men.",
        "The next morning, according to the orders of the agent, the Pilgrim\nset sail for the windward, to be gone three or four months.  She got\nunder weigh with very little fuss, and came so near us as to throw\na letter on board, Captain Faucon standing at the tiller himself,\nand steering her as he would a mackerel smack.  When Captain T––-\nwas in command of the Pilgrim, there was as much preparation\nand ceremony as there would be in getting a seventy-four under\nweigh.  Captain Faucon was a sailor, every inch of him; he knew\nwhat a ship was, and was as much at home in one, as a cobbler in\nhis stall.  I wanted no better proof of this than the opinion of\nthe ship’s crew, for they had been six months under his command,\nand knew what he was; and if sailors allow their captain to be a\ngood seaman, you may be sure he is one, for that is a thing they\nare not always ready to say.",
        "After the Pilgrim left us, we lay three weeks at San Pedro, from the\n11th of September until the 2nd of October, engaged in the usual port\nduties of landing cargo, taking off hides, etc., etc.  These duties\nwere much easier, and went on much more agreeably, than on board\nthe Pilgrim.  “The more, the merrier,” is the sailor’s maxim; and a\nboat’s crew of a dozen could take off all the hides brought down in\na day, without much trouble, by division of labor; and on shore,\nas well as on board, a good will, and no discontent or grumbling,\nmake everything go well.  The officer, too, who usually went with\nus, the third mate, was a fine young fellow, and made no unnecessary\ntrouble; so that we generally had quite a sociable time, and were\nglad to be relieved from the restraint of the ship.  While here,\nI often thought of the miserable, gloomy weeks we had spent in\nthis dull place, in the brig; discontent and hard usage on board,\nand four hands to do all the work on shore.  Give me a big ship.\nThere is more room, more hands, better outfit, better regulation,\nmore life, and more company.  Another thing was better arranged\nhere: we had a regular gig’s crew.  A light whale-boat, handsomely\npainted, and fitted out with stern seats, yoke, tiller-ropes, etc.,\nhung on the starboard quarter, and was used as the gig.  The youngest\nlad in the ship, a Boston boy about thirteen years old, was coxswain\nof this boat, and had the entire charge of her, to keep her clean,\nand have her in readiness to go and come at any hour.  Four light\nhands, of about the same size and age, of whom I was one, formed the\ncrew.  Each had his oar and seat numbered, and we were obliged to be\nin our places, have our oars scraped white, our tholepins in, and the\nfenders over the side.  The bow-man had charge of the boat-hook and\npainter, and the coxswain of the rudder, yoke, and stern-sheets.\nOur duty was to carry the captain and agent about, and passengers\noff and on; which last was no trifling duty, as the people on shore\nhave no boats, and every purchaser, from the boy who buys his pair\nof shoes, to the trader who buys his casks and bales, were to be\ntaken off and on, in our boat.  Some days, when people were coming\nand going fast, we were in the boat, pulling off and on, all day long,\nwith hardly time for our meals; making, as we lay nearly three\nmiles from shore, from forty to fifty miles’ rowing in a day.\nStill, we thought it the best berth in the ship; for when the\ngig was employed, we had nothing to do with the cargo, except\nsmall bundles which the passengers carried with them, and no\nhides to carry, besides the opportunity of seeing everybody,\nmaking acquaintances, hearing the news, etc.  Unless the captain\nor agent were in the boat, we had no officer with us, and often had\nfine times with the passengers, who were always willing to talk and\njoke with us.  Frequently, too, we were obliged to wait several hours\non shore; when we would haul the boat up on the beach, and leaving\none to watch her, go up to the nearest house, or spend the time in\nstrolling about the beach, picking up shells, or playing hopscotch,\nand other games, on the hard sand.  The rest of the crew never left\nthe ship, except for bringing heavy goods and taking off hides;\nand though we were always in the water, the surf hardly leaving us\na dry thread from morning till night, yet we were young, and the\nclimate was good, and we thought it much better than the quiet,\nhum-drum drag and pull on board ship.  We made the acquaintance\nof nearly half of California; for, besides carrying everybody in\nour boat,–men, women, and children,–all the messages, letters,\nand light packages went by us, and being known by our dress,\nwe found a ready reception everywhere.",
        "At San Pedro, we had none of this amusement, for, there being but\none house in the place, we, of course, had but little company.\nAll the variety that I had, was riding, once a week, to the\nnearest rancho, to order a bullock down for the ship.",
        "The brig Catalina came in from San Diego, and being bound up to\nwindward, we both got under weigh at the same time, for a trial\nof speed up to Santa Barbara, a distance of about eighty miles.\nWe hove up and got under sail about eleven o’clock at night, with\na light land-breeze, which died away toward morning, leaving us\nbecalmed only a few miles from our anchoring-place.  The Catalina,\nbeing a small vessel, of less than half our size, put out sweeps\nand got a boat ahead, and pulled out to sea, during the night,\nso that she had the sea-breeze earlier and stronger than we did,\nand we had the mortification of seeing her standing up the coast,\nwith a fine breeze, the sea all ruffled about her, while we\nwere becalmed, in-shore.  When the sea-breeze died away, she was\nnearly out of sight; and, toward the latter part of the afternoon,\nthe regular north-west wind set in fresh, we braced sharp upon it,\ntook a pull at every sheet, tack, and halyard, and stood after her,\nin fine style, our ship being very good upon a taughtened bowline.\nWe had nearly five hours of fine sailing, beating up to windward,\nby long stretches in and off shore, and evidently gaining upon the\nCatalina at every tack.  When this breeze left us, we were so near\nas to count the painted ports on her side.  Fortunately, the wind\ndied away when we were on our inward tack, and she on her outward,\nso we were in-shore, and caught the land-breeze first, which came\noff upon our quarter, about the middle of the first watch.  All hands\nwere turned-up, and we set all sail, to the skysails and the\nroyal studding-sails; and with these, we glided quietly through\nthe water, leaving the Catalina, which could not spread so much\ncanvas as we, gradually astern, and, by daylight, were off\nSt. Buenaventura, and our antagonist nearly out of sight.\nThe sea-breeze, however, favored her again, while we were becalmed\nunder the headland, and laboring slowly along, she was abreast of\nus by noon.  Thus we continued, ahead, astern, and abreast of one\nanother, alternately; now, far out at sea, and again, close in under\nthe shore.  On the third morning, we came into the great bay of\nSanta Barbara, two hours behind the brig, and thus lost the bet;\nthough, if the race had been to the point, we should have beaten\nher by five or six hours.  This, however, settled the relative\nsailing of the vessels, for it was admitted that although she,\nbeing small and light, could gain upon us in very light winds,\nyet whenever there was breeze enough to set us agoing, we walked\naway from her like hauling in a line; and in beating to windward,\nwhich is the best trial of a vessel, we had much the advantage of\nher.",
        "Sunday, Oct. 4th.  This was the day of our arrival; and somehow\nor other, our captain always managed not only to sail, but to come\ninto port, on a Sunday.  The main reason for sailing on the Sabbath\nis not, as many people suppose, because Sunday is thought a lucky\nday, but because it is a leisure day.  During the six days, the crew\nare employed upon the cargo and other ship’s works, and the Sabbath,\nbeing their only day of rest, whatever additional work can be thrown\ninto Sunday, is so much gain to the owners.  This is the reason of\nour coasters, packets, etc, sailing on the Sabbath.  They get six\ngood days’ work out of the crew, and then throw all the labor of\nsailing into the Sabbath.  Thus it was with us, nearly all the\ntime we were on the coast, and many of our Sabbaths were lost\nentirely to us.  The Catholics on shore have no trading and make\nno journeys on Sunday, but the American has no national religion,\nand likes to show his independence of priestcraft by doing as he\nchooses on the Lord’s day.",
        "Santa Barbara looked very much as it did when I left it five months\nbefore: the long sand beach, with the heavy rollers, breaking upon\nit in a continual roar, and the little town, imbedded on the plain,\ngirt by its amphitheatre of mountains.  Day after day, the sun shone\nclear and bright upon the wide bay and the red roofs of the houses;\neverything being as still as death, the people really hardly seeming\nto earn their sun-light.  Daylight actually seemed thrown away upon\nthem.  We had a few visitors, and collected about a hundred hides,\nand every night, at sundown, the gig was sent ashore, to wait for\nthe captain, who spent his evenings in the town.  We always took\nour monkey-jackets with us, and flint and steel, and made a fire\non the beach with the driftwood and the bushes we pulled from the\nneighboring thickets, and lay down by it, on the sand.  Sometimes we\nwould stray up to the town, if the captain was likely to stay late,\nand pass the time at some of the houses, in which we were almost\nalways well received by the inhabitants.  Sometimes earlier and\nsometimes later, the captain came down; when, after a good drenching\nin the surf, we went aboard, changed our clothes, and turned in for\nthe night–yet not for all the night, for there was the anchor watch\nto stand.",
        "This leads me to speak of my watchmate for nine months–and,\ntaking him all in all, the most remarkable man I have ever\nseen–Tom Harris.  An hour, every night, while lying in port,\nHarris and myself had the deck to ourselves, and walking fore\nand aft, night after night, for months, I learned his whole\ncharacter and history, and more about foreign nations, the habits\nof different people, and especially the secrets of sailors’ lives\nand hardships, and also of practical seamanship, (in which he was\nabundantly capable of instructing me,) than I could ever have\nlearned elsewhere.  But the most remarkable thing about him, was\nthe power of his mind.  His memory was perfect; seeming to form a\nregular chain, reaching from his earliest childhood up to the time\nI knew him, without one link wanting.  His power of calculation,\ntoo, was remarkable.  I called myself pretty quick at figures, and\nhad been through a course of mathematical studies; but, working by\nmy head, I was unable to keep within sight of this man, who had\nnever been beyond his arithmetic: so rapid was his calculation.\nHe carried in his head not only a log-book of the whole voyage,\nin which everything was complete and accurate, and from which no\none ever thought of appealing, but also an accurate registry of\nall the cargo; knowing, precisely, where each thing was, and how\nmany hides we took in at every port.",
        "One night, he made a rough calculation of the number of hides that\ncould be stowed in the lower hold, between the fore and main masts,\ntaking the depth of hold and breadth of beam, (for he always knew\nthe dimension of every part of the ship, before he had been a month\non board,) and the average area and thickness of a hide; he came\nsurprisingly near the number, as it afterwards turned out.  The mate\nfrequently came to him to know the capacity of different parts of\nthe vessel, so he could tell the sailmaker very nearly the amount\nof canvas he would want for each sail in the ship; for he knew the\nhoist of every mast, and spread of every sail, on the head and foot,\nin feet and inches.  When we were at sea, he kept a running account,\nin his head, of the ship’s way–the number of knots and the courses;\nand if the courses did not vary much during the twenty-four hours,\nby taking the whole progress, and allowing so many eighths southing\nor northing, to so many easting or westing; he would make up his\nreckoning just before the captain took the sun at noon, and often\ncame wonderfully near the mark.  Calculation of all kinds was his\ndelight.  He had, in his chest, several volumes giving accounts\nof inventions in mechanics, which he read with great pleasure,\nand made himself master of.  I doubt if he ever forgot anything\nthat he read.  The only thing in the way of poetry that he ever\nread was Falconer’s Shipwreck, which he was delighted with,\nand whole pages of which he could repeat.  He knew the name\nof every sailor that had ever been his shipmate, and also,\nof every vessel, captain, and officer, and the principal dates\nof each voyage; and a sailor whom he afterwards fell in with,\nwho had been in a ship with Harris nearly twelve years before,\nwas very much surprised at having Harris tell him things about\nhimself which he had entirely forgotten.  His facts, whether dates\nor events, no one thought of disputing; and his opinions, few of\nthe sailors dared to oppose; for, right or wrong, he always had\nthe best of the argument with them.  His reasoning powers were\nremarkable.  I have had harder work maintaining an argument with\nhim in a watch, even when I knew myself to be right, and he was\nonly doubting, than I ever had before; not from his obstinacy,\nbut from his acuteness.  Give him only a little knowledge of his\nsubject, and, certainly among all the young men of my acquaintance\nand standing at college, there was not one whom I had not rather meet,\nthan this man.  I never answered a question from him, or advanced\nan opinion to him, without thinking more than once.  With an iron\nmemory, he seemed to have your whole past conversation at command,\nand if you said a thing now which ill agreed with something said\nmonths before, he was sure to have you on the hip.  In fact,\nI always felt, when with him, that I was with no common man.\nI had a positive respect for his powers of mind, and felt often\nthat if half the pains had been spent upon his education which\nare thrown away, yearly, in our colleges, he would have been\na man of great weight in society.  Like most self-taught men,\nhe over-estimated the value of an education; and this, I often\ntold him, though I profited by it myself; for he always treated\nme with respect, and often unnecessarily gave way to me, from an\nover-estimate of my knowledge.  For the intellectual capacities\nof all the rest of the crew, captain and all, he had the most\nsovereign contempt.  He was a far better sailor, and probably\na better navigator, than the captain, and had more brains than\nall the after part of the ship put together.  The sailors said,\n\"Tom’s got a head as long as the bowsprit,” and if any one got\ninto an argument with him, they would call out–\"Ah, Jack! you’d\nbetter drop that, as you would a hot potato, for Tom will turn\nyou inside out before you know it.”",
        "I recollect his posing me once on the subject of the Corn Laws.\nI was called to stand my watch, and, coming on deck, found him\nthere before me; and we began, as usual, to walk fore and aft,\nin the waist.  He talked about the Corn Laws; asked me my opinion\nabout them, which I gave him; and my reasons; my small stock of\nwhich I set forth to the best advantage, supposing his knowledge\non the subject must be less than mine, if, indeed, he had\nany at all.  When I had got through, he took the liberty of\ndiffering from me, and, to my surprise, brought arguments and\nfacts connected with the subject which were new to me, to which\nI was entirely unable to reply.  I confessed that I knew almost\nnothing of the subject, and expressed my surprise at the extent\nof his information.  He said that, a number of years before,\nwhile at a boarding-house in Liverpool, he had fallen in with\na pamphlet on the subject, and, as it contained calculations,\nhad read it very carefully, and had ever since wished to find\nsome one who could add to his stock of knowledge on the question.\nAlthough it was many years since he had seen the book, and it was\na subject with which he had no previous acquaintance, yet he had\nthe chain of reasoning, founded upon principles of political\neconomy, perfect in his memory; and his facts, so far as I\ncould judge, were correct; at least, he stated them with great\nprecision.  The principles of the steam engine, too, he was very\nfamiliar with, having been several months on board of a steamboat,\nand made himself master of its secrets.  He knew every lunar star\nin both hemispheres, and was a perfect master of his quadrant and\nsextant.  Such was the man, who, at forty, was still a dog before\nthe mast, at twelve dollars a month.  The reason of this was to\nbe found in his whole past life, as I had it, at different times,\nfrom himself.",
        "He was an Englishman, by birth, a native of Ilfracomb, in Devonshire.\nHis father was skipper of a small coaster, from Bristol, and dying,\nleft him, when quite young, to the care of his mother, by whose\nexertions he received a common-school education, passing his\nwinters at school and his summers in the coasting trade, until his\nseventeenth year, when he left home to go upon foreign voyages.\nOf his mother, he often spoke with the greatest respect, and said\nthat she was a strong-minded woman, and had the best system of\neducation he had ever known; a system which had made respectable\nmen of his three brothers, and failed only in him, from his own\nindomitable obstinacy.  One thing he often mentioned, in which he\nsaid his mother differed from all other mothers that he had ever\nseen disciplining their children; that was, that when he was out\nof humor and refused to eat, instead of putting his plate away,\nas most mothers would, and saying that his hunger would bring\nhim to it, in time, she would stand over him and oblige him to\neat it–every mouthful of it.  It was no fault of hers that he\nwas what I saw him; and so great was his sense of gratitude for\nher efforts, though unsuccessful, that he determined, at the\nclose of the voyage, to embark for home with all the wages he\nshould get, to spend with and for his mother, if perchance he\nshould find her alive.",
        "After leaving home, he had spent nearly twenty years, sailing upon\nall sorts of voyages, generally out of the ports of New York and\nBoston.  Twenty years of vice!  Every sin that a sailor knows, he\nhad gone to the bottom of.  Several times he had been hauled up in\nthe hospitals, and as often, the great strength of his constitution\nhad brought him out again in health.  Several times, too, from his\nknown capacity, he had been promoted to the office of chief mate,\nand as often, his conduct when in port, especially his drunkenness,\nwhich neither fear nor ambition could induce him to abandon, put him\nback into the forecastle.  One night, when giving me an account of his\nlife, and lamenting the years of manhood he had thrown away, he said\nthat there, in the forecastle, at the foot of the steps–a chest\nof old clothes–was the result of twenty-two years of hard labor\nand exposure–worked like a horse, and treated like a dog.  As he\ngrew older, he began to feel the necessity of some provision for\nhis later years, and came gradually to the conviction that rum had\nbeen his worst enemy.  One night, in Havana, a young shipmate of\nhis was brought aboard drunk, with a dangerous gash in his head,\nand his money and new clothes stripped from him.  Harris had seen\nand been in hundreds of such scenes as these, but in his then state\nof mind, it fixed his determination, and he resolved never to taste\nanother drop of strong drink, of any kind.  He signed no pledge, and\nmade no vow, but relied on his own strength of purpose.  The first\nthing with him was a reason, and then a resolution, and the thing\nwas done.  The date of his resolution he knew, of course, to the\nvery hour.  It was three years before I knew him, and during all\nthat time, nothing stronger than cider or coffee had passed his\nlips.  The sailors never thought of enticing Tom to take a glass,\nany more than they would of talking to the ship’s compass.  He was\nnow a temperate man for life, and capable of filling any berth in\na ship, and many a high station there is on shore which is held by\na meaner man.",
        "He understood the management of a ship upon scientific principles,\nand could give the reason for hauling every rope; and a long\nexperience, added to careful observation at the time, and a\nperfect memory, gave him a knowledge of the expedients and resorts\nin times of hazard, which was remarkable, and for which I became\nmuch indebted to him, as he took the greatest pleasure in opening\nhis stores of information to me, in return for what I was able to\ndo for him.  Stories of tyranny and hardship which had driven men\nto piracy;–of the incredible ignorance of masters and mates,\nand of horrid brutality to the sick, dead, and dying; as well\nas of the secret knavery and impositions practised upon seamen\nby connivance of the owners, landlords, and officers; all these\nhe had, and I could not but believe them; for men who had known him\nfor fifteen years had never taken him even in an exaggeration, and,\nas I have said, his statements were never disputed.  I remember,\namong other things, his speaking of a captain whom I had known\nby report, who never handed a thing to a sailor, but put it on\ndeck and kicked it to him; and of another, who was of the best\nconnections in Boston, who absolutely murdered a lad from Boston\nthat went out with him before the mast to Sumatra, by keeping him\nhard at work while ill of the coast fever, and obliging him to\nsleep in the close steerage.  (The same captain has since died\nof the same fever on the same coast.)",
        "In fact, taking together all that I learned from him of seamanship,\nof the history of sailors’ lives, of practical wisdom, and of human\nnature under new circumstances,–a great history from which many are\nshut out,–I would not part with the hours I spent in the watch with\nthat man for any given hours of my life passed in study and social\nintercourse.",
        "Sunday, Oct. 11th.  Set sail this morning for the leeward; passed\nwithin sight of San Pedro, and, to our great joy, did not come\nto anchor, but kept directly on to San Diego, where we arrived\nand moored ship on.",
        "Thursday, Oct. 15th.  Found here the Italian ship La Rosa, from\nthe windward, which reported the brig Pilgrim at San Francisco,\nall well.  Everything was as quiet here as usual.  We discharged\nour hides, horns, and tallow, and were ready to sail again on the\nfollowing Sunday.  I went ashore to my old quarters, and found the\ngang at the hide-house going on in the even tenor of their way,\nand spent an hour or two, after dark, at the oven, taking a whiff\nwith my old Kanaka friends, who really seemed glad to see me again,\nand saluted me as the Aikane of the Kanakas.  I was grieved to find\nthat my poor dog Bravo was dead.  He had sickened and died suddenly,\nthe very day after I sailed in the Alert.",
        "Sunday was again, as usual, our sailing day, and we got under weigh\nwith a stiff breeze, which reminded us that it was the latter part\nof the autumn, and time to expect south-easters once more.  We beat\nup against a strong head wind, under reefed top-sails, as far as San\nJuan, where we came to anchor nearly three miles from the shore,\nwith slip-ropes on our cables, in the old south-easter style\nof last winter.  On the passage up, we had an old sea captain\non board, who had married and settled in California, and had\nnot been on salt water for more than fifteen years.  He was\nastonished at the changes and improvements that had been made\nin ships, and still more at the manner in which we carried sail;\nfor he was really a little frightened; and said that while we had\ntop-gallant sails on, he should have been under reefed topsails.\nThe working of the ship, and her progress to windward, seemed to\ndelight him, for he said she went to windward as though she were\nkedging.",
        "Tuesday, Oct. 20th.  Having got everything ready, we set the\nagent ashore, who went up to the mission to hasten down the\nhides for the next morning.  This night we had the strictest\norders to look out for south-easters; and the long, low clouds\nseemed rather threatening.  But the night passed over without\nany trouble, and early the next morning, we hove out the long-boat\nand pinnace, lowered away the quarter-boats, and went ashore to\nbring off our hides.  Here we were again, in this romantic spot;\na perpendicular hill, twice the height of the ship’s mast-head,\nwith a single circuitous path to the top, and long sand beach at\nits base, with the swell of the whole Pacific breaking high upon\nit, and our hides ranged in piles on the overhanging summit.\nThe captain sent me, who was the only one of the crew that had\never been there before, to the top, to count the hides and pitch\nthem down.  There I stood again, as six months before, throwing\noff the hides, and watching them, pitching and scaling, to the\nbottom, while the men, dwarfed by the distance, were walking to\nand fro on the beach, carrying the hides, as they picked them up,\nto the distant boats, upon the tops of their heads.  Two or three\nboat-loads were sent off, until, at last, all were thrown down,\nand the boats nearly loaded again; when we were delayed by a dozen\nor twenty hides which had lodged in the recesses of the hill, and\nwhich we could not reach by any missiles, as the general line of\nthe side was exactly perpendicular, and these places were caved\nin, and could not be seen or reached from the top.  As hides are\nworth in Boston twelve and a half cents a pound, and the captain’s\ncommission was two per cent, he determined not to give them up;\nand sent on board for a pair of top-gallant studding-sail halyards,\nand requested some one of the crew to go to the top, and come down\nby the halyards.  The older sailors said the boys, who were light\nand active, ought to go, while the boys thought that strength and\nexperience were necessary.  Seeing the dilemma, and feeling myself\nto be near the medium of these requisites, I offered my services,\nand went up, with one man to tend the rope, and prepared for the\ndescent.",
        "We found a stake fastened strongly into the ground, and apparently\ncapable of holding my weight, to which we made one end of the\nhalyards well fast, and taking the coil, threw it over the brink.\nThe end, we saw, just reached to a landing-place, from which the\ndescent to the beach was easy.  Having nothing on but shirt,\ntrowsers, and hat, the common sea-rig of warm weather, I had\nno stripping to do, and began my descent, by taking hold of the\nrope in each hand, and slipping down, sometimes with hands and\nfeet round the rope, and sometimes breasting off with one hand\nand foot against the precipice, and holding on to the rope with\nthe other.  In this way I descended until I came to a place which\nshelved in, and in which the hides were lodged.  Keeping hold of\nthe rope with one hand, I scrambled in, and by the other hand\nand feet succeeded in dislodging all the hides, and continued on\nmy way.  Just below this place, the precipice projected again,\nand going over the projection, I could see nothing below me but\nthe sea and the rocks upon which it broke, and a few gulls flying\nin mid-air.  I got down in safety, pretty well covered with dirt;\nand for my pains was told, “What a d–d fool you were to risk your\nlife for a half a dozen hides!”",
        "While we were carrying the hides to the boat, I perceived, what I\nhad been too busy to observe before, that heavy black clouds were\nrolling up from seaward, a strong swell heaving in, and every sign\nof a south-easter.  The captain hurried everything.  The hides were\npitched into the boats; and, with some difficulty, and by wading\nnearly up to our armpits, we got the boats through the surf, and began\npulling aboard.  Our gig’s crew towed the pinnace astern of the gig,\nand the launch was towed by six men in the jolly-boat.  The ship was\nlying three miles off, pitching at her anchor, and the farther we\npulled, the heavier grew the swell.  Our boat stood nearly up and\ndown several times; the pinnace parted her towline, and we expected\nevery moment to see the launch swamped.  We at length got alongside,\nour boats half full of water; and now came the greatest difficulty\nof all,–unloading the boats, in a heavy sea, which pitched them\nabout so that it was almost impossible to stand in them; raising\nthem sometimes even with the rail, and again dropping them below\nthe bends.  With great difficulty, we got all the hides aboard and\nstowed under hatches, the yard and stay tackles hooked on, and the\nlaunch and pinnace hoisted, checked, and griped.  The quarter-boats\nwere then hoisted up, and we began heaving in on the chain.\nGetting the anchor was no easy work in such a sea, but as we\nwere not coming back to this port, the captain determined not\nto slip.  The ship’s head pitched into the sea, and the water\nrushed through the hawse-holes, and the chain surged so as almost\nto unship the barrel of the windlass.  “Hove short, sir!” said\nthe mate.  “Aye, aye!  Weather-bit your chain and loose the\ntopsails!  Make sail on her, men–with a will!”  A few moments\nserved to loose the topsails, which were furled with reefs,\nto sheet them home, and hoist them up.  “Bear a hand!” was the\norder of the day; and every one saw the necessity of it, for the\ngale was already upon us.  The ship broke out her own anchor,\nwhich we catted and fished, after a fashion, and stood off from\nthe lee-shore against a heavy head sea, under reefed topsails,\nfore-topmast staysail and spanker.  The fore course was given\nto her, which helped her a little; but as she hardly held her\nown against the sea which was settling her leeward–\"Board the\nmain tack!” shouted the captain; when the tack was carried forward\nand taken to the windlass, and all hands called to the handspikes.\nThe great sail bellied out horizontally as though it would lift up\nthe main stay; the blocks rattled and flew about; but the force of\nmachinery was too much for her.  “Heave ho!  Heave and pawl!  Yo,\nheave, hearty, ho!” and, in time with the song, by the force of\ntwenty strong arms, the windlass came slowly round, pawl after pawl,\nand the weather clew of the sail was brought down to the waterways.\nThe starboard watch hauled aft the sheet, and the ship tore through\nthe water like a mad horse, quivering and shaking at every joint,\nand dashing from its head the foam, which flew off at every blow,\nyards and yards to leeward.  A half hour of such sailing served our\nturn, when the clews of the sail were hauled up, the sail furled,\nand the ship, eased of her press, went more quietly on her way.\nSoon after, the foresail was reefed, and we mizen-top men were\nsent up to take another reef in the mizen topsail.  This was the\nfirst time I had taken a weather earing, and I felt not a little\nproud to sit, astride of the weather yard-arm, pass the earing,\nand sing out “Haul out to leeward!”  From this time until we got\nto Boston, the mate never suffered any one but our own gang to\ngo upon the mizen topsail yard, either for reefing or furling,\nand the young English lad and myself generally took the earings\nbetween us.",
        "Having cleared the point and got well out to sea, we squared away\nthe yards, made more sail, and stood on, nearly before the wind,\nfor San Pedro.  It blew strong, with some rain, nearly all night,\nbut fell calm toward morning, and the gale having gone over,\nwe came-to,–",
        "Thursday, Oct. 22d, at San Pedro, in the old south-easter berth,\na league from shore, with a slip-rope on the cable, reefs in the\ntopsails, and rope-yarns for gaskets.  Here we lay ten days,\nwith the usual boating, hide-carrying, rolling of cargo up the\nsteep hill, walking barefooted over stones, and getting drenched\nin salt water.",
        "The third day after our arrival, the Rosa came in from San Juan,\nwhere she went the day after the south-easter.  Her crew said it was\nas smooth as a mill-pond, after the gale, and she took off nearly\na thousand hides, which had been brought down for us, and which\nwe lost in consequence of the south-easter.  This mortified us;\nnot only that an Italian ship should have got to windward of us in\nthe trade, but because every thousand hides went toward completing\nthe forty thousand which we were to collect before we could say\ngood-by to California.",
        "While lying here, we shipped one new hand, an Englishman, of about\ntwo or three and twenty, who was quite an acquisition, as he proved\nto be a good sailor, could sing tolerably, and, what was of more\nimportance to me, had a good education, and a somewhat remarkable\nhistory.  He called himself George P. Marsh; professed to have been\nat sea from a small boy, and to have served his time in the smuggling\ntrade between Germany and the coasts of France and England.  Thus he\naccounted for his knowledge of the French language, which he spoke\nand read as well as he did English; but his cutter education would\nnot account for his English, which was far too good to have been\nlearned in a smuggler; for he wrote an uncommonly handsome hand,\nspoke with great correctness, and frequently, when in private talk\nwith me, quoted from books, and showed a knowledge of the customs\nof society, and particularly of the formalities of the various\nEnglish courts of law, and of Parliament, which surprised me.\nStill, he would give no other account of himself than that he\nwas educated in a smuggler.  A man whom we afterwards fell in with,\nwho had been a shipmate of George’s a few years before, said that\nhe heard at the boarding-house from which they shipped, that George\nhad been at college, (probably a naval one, as he knew no Latin\nor Greek,) where he learned French and mathematics.  He was by\nno means the man by nature that Harris was.  Harris had made\neverything of his mind and character in spite of obstacles;\nwhile this man had evidently been born in a different rank,\nand educated early in life accordingly, but had been a vagabond,\nand done nothing for himself since.  What had been given to him\nby others, was all that made him to differ from those about him;\nwhile Harris had made himself what he was.  Neither had George\nthe character, strength of mind, acuteness, or memory of Harris;\nyet there was about him the remains of a pretty good education,\nwhich enabled him to talk perhaps beyond his brains, and a high\nspirit and sense of honor, which years of a dog’s life had not\nbroken.  After he had been a little while on board, we learned\nfrom him his remarkable history, for the last two years, which we\nafterwards heard confirmed in such a manner, as put the truth of\nit beyond a doubt.",
        "He sailed from New York in the year 1833, if I mistake not, before\nthe mast, in the brig Lascar, for Canton.  She was sold in the East\nIndies, and he shipped at Manilla, in a small schooner, bound on\na trading voyage among the Ladrone and Pelew Islands.  On one of\nthe latter islands, their schooner was wrecked on a reef, and they\nwere attacked by the natives, and, after a desperate resistance,\nin which all their number except the captain, George, and a boy,\nwere killed or drowned, they surrendered, and were carried bound,\nin a canoe, to a neighboring island.  In about a month after this,\nan opportunity occurred by which one of their number might get\naway.  I have forgotten the circumstances, but only one could go,\nand they yielded to the captain, upon his promising to send them\naid if he escaped.  He was successful in his attempt; got on board\nan American vessel, went back to Manilla, and thence to America,\nwithout making any effort for their rescue, or indeed, as George\nafterwards discovered, without even mentioning their case to any\none in Manilla.  The boy that was with George died, and he being\nalone, and there being no chance for his escape, the natives\nsoon treated him with kindness, and even with attention.  They\npainted him, tattooed his body, (for he would never consent to\nbe marked in the face or hands,) gave him two or three wives;\nand, in fact, made quite a pet of him.  In this way, he lived\nfor thirteen months, in a fine climate, with a plenty to eat,\nhalf naked, and nothing to do.  He soon, however, became tired,\nand went round the island, on different pretences, to look out\nfor a sail.  One day, he was out fishing in a small canoe with\nanother man, when he saw a large sail to the windward, about a\nleague and a half off, passing abreast of the island and standing\nwestward.  With some difficulty, he persuaded the islander to go\noff with him to the ship, promising to return with a good supply\nof rum and tobacco.  These articles, which the islanders had got\na taste of from American traders, were too strong a temptation\nfor the fellow, and he consented.  They paddled off in the track of\nthe ship, and lay-to until she came down to them.  George stepped\non board the ship, nearly naked, painted from head to foot, and in\nno way distinguishable from his companion until he began to speak.\nUpon this, the people on board were not a little astonished; and,\nhaving learned his story, the captain had him washed and clothed,\nand sending away the poor astonished native with a knife or two\nand some tobacco and calico, took George with him on the voyage.\nThis was the ship Cabot, of New York, Captain Low.  She was bound\nto Manilla, from across the Pacific, and George did seaman’s duty\nin her until her arrival in Manilla, when he left her, and shipped\nin a brig bound to the Sandwich Islands.  From Oahu, he came,\nin the British brig Clementine, to Monterey, as second officer,\nwhere, having some difficulty with the captain, he left her,\nand coming down the coast, joined us at San Pedro.  Nearly six\nmonths after this, among some papers we received by an arrival\nfrom Boston, we found a letter from Captain Low, of the Cabot,\npublished immediately upon his arrival at New York, and giving all\nthe particulars just as we had them from George.  The letter was\npublished for the information of the friends of George, and Captain\nLow added, that he left him at Manilia to go to Oahu, and he had\nheard nothing of him since.",
        "George had an interesting journal of his adventures in the Pelew\nIslands, which he had written out at length, in a handsome hand,\nand in correct English.",
        "Sunday, November 1st.  Sailed this day, (Sunday again,) for\nSanta Barbara, where we arrived on the 5th.  Coming round St.\nBuenaventura, and nearing the anchorage, we saw two vessels in port,\na large full-rigged, and a small hermaphrodite brig.  The former,\nthe crew said must be the Pilgrim; but I had been too long in the\nPilgrim to be mistaken in her, and I was right in differing from\nthem; for, upon nearer approach, her long, low shear, sharp bows,\nand raking masts, told quite another story.  “Man-of-war brig,\"\nsaid some of them; “Baltimore clipper,” said others; the Ayacucho,\nthought I; and soon the broad folds of the beautiful banner of\nSt. George,–white field with blood-red border and cross,–were\ndisplayed from her peak.  A few minutes put it beyond a doubt,\nand we were lying by the side of the Ayacucho, which had sailed\nfrom San Diego about nine months before, while we were lying there\nin the Pilgrim.  She had since been to Valparaiso, Callao, and the\nSandwich Islands, and had just come upon the coast.  Her boat came\non board, bringing Captain Wilson; and in half an hour the news was\nall over the ship that there was a war between the United States\nand France.  Exaggerated accounts reached the forecastle.\nBattles had been fought, a large French fleet was in the Pacific,\netc., etc.; and one of the boat’s crew of the Ayacucho said that\nwhen they left Callao, a large French frigate and the American\nfrigate Brandywine, which were lying there, were going outside to\nhave a battle, and that the English frigate Blonde was to be umpire,\nand see fair play.  Here was important news for us.  Alone, on an\nunprotected coast, without an American man-of-war within some\nthousands of miles, and the prospect of a voyage home through the\nwhole length of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans!  A French prison\nseemed a much more probable place of destination than the good port\nof Boston.  However, we were too salt to believe every yarn that\ncomes into the forecastle, and waited to hear the truth of the\nmatter from higher authority.  By means of a supercargo’s clerk,\nI got the account of the matter, which was, that the governments\nhad had difficulty about the payment of a debt; that war had been\nthreatened and prepared for, but not actually declared, although it\nwas pretty generally anticipated.  This was not quite so bad, yet\nwas no small cause of anxiety.  But we cared very little about the\nmatter ourselves.  “Happy go lucky” with Jack!  We did not believe\nthat a French prison would be much worse than “hide-droghing” on\nthe coast of California; and no one who has not been on a long,\ndull voyage, shut up in one ship, can conceive of the effect of\nmonotony upon one’s thoughts and wishes.  The prospect of a change\nis like a green spot in a desert, and the remotest probability\nof great events and exciting scenes gives a feeling of delight,\nand sets life in motion, so as to give a pleasure, which any one\nnot in the same state would be entirely unable to account for.\nIn fact, a more jovial night we had not passed in the forecastle\nfor months.  Every one seemed in unaccountably high spirits.\nAn undefined anticipation of radical changes, of new scenes,\nand great doings, seemed to have possessed every one, and the\ncommon drudgery of the vessel appeared contemptible.  Here was a\nnew vein opened; a grand theme of conversation, and a topic for all\nsorts of discussions.  National feeling was wrought up.  Jokes were\ncracked upon the only Frenchman in the ship, and comparisons made\nbetween “old horse” and “soup meagre,” etc., etc.",
        "We remained in uncertainty as to this war for more than two months,\nwhen an arrival from the Sandwich Islands brought us the news of an\namicable arrangement of the difficulties. ",
        "The other vessel which we found in port was the hermaphrodite brig\nAvon, from the Sandwich Islands.  She was fitted up in handsome style;\nfired a gun and ran her ensign up and down at sunrise and sunset; had a\nband of four or five pieces of music on board, and appeared rather like\na pleasure yacht than a trader; yet, in connection with the Loriotte,\nClementine, Bolivar, Convoy, and other small vessels, belonging to\nsundry Americans at Oahu, she carried on a great trade–legal and\nillegal–in otter skins, silks, teas, specie, etc.",
        "The second day after our arrival, a full-rigged brig came round\nthe point from the northward, sailed leisurely through the bay,\nand stood off again for the south-east, in the direction of the\nlarge island of Catalina.  The next day the Avon got under weigh,\nand stood in the same direction, bound for San Pedro.  This might\ndo for marines and Californians, but we knew the ropes too well.\nThe brig was never again seen on the coast, and the Avon arrived\nat San Pedro in about a week, with a full cargo of Canton and\nAmerican goods.",
        "This was one of the means of escaping the heavy duties the Mexicans\nlay upon all imports.  A vessel comes on the coast, enters a\nmoderate cargo at Monterey, which is the only custom-house,\nand commences trading.  In a month or more, having sold a large\npart of her cargo, she stretches over to Catalina, or other of the\nlarge uninhabited islands which lie off the coast, in a trip from\nport to port, and supplies herself with choice goods from a vessel\nfrom Oahu, which has been lying off and on the islands, waiting for\nher.  Two days after the sailing of the Avon, the Loriotte came\nin from the leeward, and without doubt had also a snatch at the\nbrig’s cargo.",
        "Tuesday, Nov. 10th.  Going ashore, as usual, in the gig, just\nbefore sundown, to bring off the captain, we found, upon taking\nin the captain and pulling off again, that our ship, which lay\nthe farthest out, had run up her ensign.  This meant “Sail ho!\"\nof course, but as we were within the point we could see nothing.\n\"Give way, boys!  Give way!  Lay out on your oars, and long stroke!\"\nsaid the captain; and stretching to the whole length of our arms,\nbending back again, so that our backs touched the thwarts, we sent\nher through the water like a rocket.  A few minutes of such pulling\nopened the islands, one after another, in range of the point, and gave\nus a view of the Canal, where was a ship, under top-gallant sails,\nstanding in, with a light breeze, for the anchorage.  Putting the\nboat’s head in the direction of the ship, the captain told us to lay\nout again; and we needed no spurring, for the prospect of boarding a\nnew ship, perhaps from home, hearing the news and having something\nto tell of when we got back, was excitement enough for us, and we\ngave way with a will.  Captain Nye, of the Loriotte, who had\nbeen an old whaleman, was in the stern-sheets, and fell mightily\ninto the spirit of it.  “Bend your backs and break your oars!\"\nsaid he.  “Lay me on, Captain Bunker!”  “There she flukes!” and\nother exclamations, peculiar to whalemen.  In the meantime, it\nfell flat calm, and being within a couple of miles of the ship,\nwe expected to board her in a few moments, when a sudden breeze\nsprung up, dead ahead for the ship, and she braced up and stood\noff toward the islands, sharp on the larboard tack, making good\nway through the water.  This, of course, brought us up, and we\nhad only to “ease larboard oars; pull round starboard!” and go\naboard the Alert, with something very like a flea in the ear.\nThere was a light land-breeze all night, and the ship did not come\nto anchor until the next morning.  As soon as her anchor was down,\nwe went aboard, and found her to be the whaleship, Wilmington and\nLiverpool Packet, of New Bedford, last from the “off-shore ground,\"\nwith nineteen hundred barrels of oil.  A “spouter” we knew her to\nbe as soon as we saw her, by her cranes and boats, and by her stump\ntop-gallant masts, and a certain slovenly look to the sails, rigging,\nspars and hull; and when we got on board, we found everything to\ncorrespond,–spouter fashion.  She had a false deck, which was\nrough and oily, and cut up in every direction by the chimes of\noil casks; her rigging was slack and turning white; no paint on\nthe spars or blocks; clumsy seizings and straps without covers,\nand homeward-bound splices in every direction.  Her crew, too,\nwere not in much better order.  Her captain was a slab-sided,\nshamble-legged Quaker, in a suit of brown, with a broad-brimmed\nhat, and sneaking about decks, like a sheep, with his head down;\nand the men looked more like fishermen and farmers than they did\nlike sailors.",
        "Though it was by no means cold weather, (we having on only our red\nshirts and duck trowsers,) they all had on woollen trowsers–not blue\nand shipshape–but of all colors–brown, drab, grey, aye, and green,\nwith suspenders over their shoulders, and pockets to put their hands\nin.  This, added to guernsey frocks, striped comforters about the\nneck, thick cowhide boots, woollen caps, and a strong, oily smell,\nand a decidedly green look, will complete the description.  Eight or\nten were on the fore-topsail yard, and as many more in the main,\nfurling the topsails, while eight or ten were hanging about the\nforecastle, doing nothing.  This was a strange sight for a vessel\ncoming to anchor; so we went up to them, to see what was the matter.\nOne of them, a stout, hearty-looking fellow, held out his leg and\nsaid he had the scurvy; another had cut his hand; and others had\ngot nearly well, but said that there were plenty aloft to furl the\nsails, so they were sogering on the forecastle.  There was only one\n\"splicer” on board, a fine-looking old tar, who was in the bunt of\nthe fore-topsail.  He was probably the only sailor in the ship,\nbefore the mast.  The mates, of course, and the boat-steerers,\nand also two or three of the crew, had been to sea before, but\nonly whaling voyages; and the greater part of the crew were raw\nhands, just from the bush, as green as cabbages, and had not yet\ngot the hay-seed out of their heads.  The mizen topsail hung in\nthe bunt-lines until everything was furled forward.  Thus a crew\nof thirty men were half an hour in doing what would have been\ndone in the Alert with eighteen hands to go aloft, in fifteen\nor twenty minutes.",
        "We found they had been at sea six or eight months, and had no news\nto tell us; so we left them, and promised to get liberty to come\non board in the evening, for some curiosities, etc.  Accordingly,\nas soon as we were knocked off in the evening and had got supper,\nwe obtained leave, took a boat, and went aboard and spent an hour\nor two.  They gave us pieces of whalebone, and the teeth and other\nparts of curious sea animals, and we exchanged books with them–a\npractice very common among ships in foreign ports, by which you\nget rid of the books you have read and re-read, and a supply of\nnew ones in their stead, and Jack is not very nice as to their\ncomparative value.",
        "Thursday, Nov. 12th.  This day was quite cool in the early part,\nand there were black clouds about; but as it was often so in the\nmorning, nothing was apprehended, and all the captains went\nashore together, to spend the day.  Towards noon, the clouds\nhung heavily over the mountains, coming half way down the\nhills that encircle the town of Santa Barbara, and a heavy\nswell rolled in from the south-east.  The mate immediately\nordered the gig’s crew away, and at the same time, we saw boats\npulling ashore from the other vessels.  Here was a grand chance\nfor a rowing match, and every one did his best.  We passed the\nboats of the Ayacucho and Loriotte, but could gain nothing upon,\nand indeed, hardly hold our own with, the long, six-oared boat of\nthe whale-ship.  They reached the breakers before us; but here\nwe had the advantage of them, for, not being used to the surf,\nthey were obliged to wait to see us beach our boat, just as,\nin the same place, nearly a year before, we, in the Pilgrim,\nwere glad to be taught by a boat’s crew of Kanakas.",
        "We had hardly got the boats beached, and their heads out, before our\nold friend, Bill Jackson, the handsome English sailor, who steered\nthe Loriotte’s boat, called out that the brig was adrift; and, sure\nenough, she was dragging her anchors, and drifting down into the\nbight of the bay.  Without waiting for the captain, (for there\nwas no one on board but the mate and steward,) he sprung into\nthe boat, called the Kanakas together, and tried to put off.\nBut the Kanakas, though capital water-dogs, were frightened by\ntheir vessel’s being adrift, and by the emergency of the case,\nand seemed to lose their faculties.  Twice, their boat filled,\nand came broadside upon the beach.  Jackson swore at them for\na parcel of savages, and promised to flog every one of them.\nThis made the matter no better; when we came forward, told the\nKanakas to take their seats in the boat, and, going two on each\nside, walked out with her till it was up to our shoulders, and gave\nthem a shove, when, giving way with their oars, they got her safely\ninto the long, regular swell.  In the mean time, boats had put off\nfrom our ships and the whaler, and coming all on board the brig\ntogether, they let go the other anchor, paid out chain, braced the\nyards to the wind, and brought the vessel up.",
        "In a few minutes, the captains came hurrying down, on the run;\nand there was no time to be lost, for the gale promised to be a\nsevere one, and the surf was breaking upon the beach, three deep,\nhigher and higher every instant.  The Ayacucho’s boat, pulled by four\nKanakas, put off first, and as they had no rudder or steering oar,\nwould probably never have got off, had we not waded out with them,\nas far as the surf would permit.  The next that made the attempt was\nthe whale-boat, for we, being the most experienced “beach-combers,\"\nneeded no help, and staid till the last.  Whalemen make the best\nboats’ crews in the world for a long pull, but this landing was\nnew to them, and notwithstanding the examples they had had, they\nslued round and were hove up–boat, oars, and men–altogether,\nhigh and dry upon the sand.  The second time, they filled, and had\nto turn their boat over, and set her off again.  We could be of no\nhelp to them, for they were so many as to be in one another’s way,\nwithout the addition of our numbers.  The third time, they got off,\nthough not without shipping a sea which drenched them all, and half\nfilled their boat, keeping them baling, until they reached their\nship.  We now got ready to go off, putting the boat’s head out;\nEnglish Ben and I, who were the largest, standing on each side of\nthe bows, to keep her “head on” to the sea, two more shipping and\nmanning the two after oars, and the captain taking the steering\noar.  Two or three Spaniards, who stood upon the beach looking\nat us, wrapped their cloaks about them, shook their heads, and\nmuttered “Caramba!”  They had no taste for such doings; in fact,\nthe hydrophobia is a national malady, and shows itself in their\npersons as well as their actions.",
        "Watching for a “smooth chance,” we determined to show the other\nboats the way it should be done; and, as soon as ours floated,\nran out with her, keeping her head on, with all our strength, and\nthe help of the captain’s oar, and the two after oarsmen giving\nway regularly and strongly, until our feet were off the ground,\nwe tumbled into the bows, keeping perfectly still, from fear of\nhindering the others.  For some time it was doubtful how it would\ngo.  The boat stood nearly up and down in the water, and the sea,\nrolling from under her, let her fall upon the water with a force\nwhich seemed almost to stave her bottom in.  By quietly sliding\ntwo oars forward, along the thwarts, without impeding the rowers,\nwe shipped two bow oars, and thus, by the help of four oars and\nthe captain’s strong arm, we got safely off, though we shipped\nseveral seas, which left us half full of water.  We pulled\nalongside of the Loriotte, put her skipper on board, and found\nher making preparations for slipping, and then pulled aboard our\nown ship.  Here Mr. Brown, always “on hand,” had got everything\nready, so that we had only to hook on the gig and hoist it up,\nwhen the order was given to loose the sails.  While we were on\nthe yards, we saw the Loriotte under weigh, and before our yards\nwere mast-headed, the Ayacucho had spread her wings, and, with yards\nbraced sharp up, was standing athwart our hawse.  There is no prettier\nsight in the world than a full-rigged, clipper-built brig, sailing sharp\non the wind.  In a moment, our slip-rope was gone, the head-yards filled\naway, and we were off.  Next came the whaler; and in a half an hour from\nthe time when four vessels were lying quietly at anchor, without a\nrag out, or a sign of motion, the bay was deserted, and four white\nclouds were standing off to sea.  Being sure of clearing the point,\nwe stood off with our yards a little braced in, while the Ayacucho\nwent off with a taught bowline, which brought her to windward of us.\nDuring all this day, and the greater part of the night, we had the\nusual south-easter entertainment, a gale of wind, variegated and\nfinally topped off with a drenching rain of three or four hours.\nAt daybreak, the clouds thinned off and rolled away, and the sun\ncame up clear.  The wind, instead of coming out from the northward,\nas is usual, blew steadily and freshly from the anchoring-ground.\nThis was bad for us, for, being “flying light,” with little more\nthan ballast trim, we were in no condition for showing off on a\ntaught bowline, and had depended upon a fair wind, with which,\nby the help of our light sails and studding-sails, we meant to\nhave been the first at the anchoring-ground; but the Ayacucho\nwas a good league to windward of us, and was standing in, in fine\nstyle.  The whaler, however, was as far to leeward of us, and the\nLoriotte was nearly out of sight, among the islands, up the Canal.\nBy hauling every brace and bowline, and clapping watch-tackles upon\nall the sheets and halyards, we managed to hold our own, and drop\nthe leeward vessels a little in every tack.  When we reached the\nanchoring-ground, the Ayacucho had got her anchor, furled her\nsails, squared her yards, and was lying as quietly as if nothing\nhad happened for the last twenty-four hours.",
        "We had our usual good luck in getting our anchor without letting go\nanother, and were all snug, with our boats at the boom-ends, in half\nan hour.  In about two hours more, the whaler came in, and made a\nclumsy piece of work in getting her anchor, being obliged to let\ngo her best bower, and finally, to get out a kedge and a hawser.\nThey were heave-ho-ing, stopping and unstopping, pawling, catting,\nand fishing, for three hours; and the sails hung from the yards all\nthe afternoon, and were not furled until sundown.  The Loriotte came\nin just after dark, and let go her anchor, making no attempt to pick\nup the other until the next day.",
        "This affair led to a great dispute as to the sailing of our ship\nand the Ayacucho.  Bets were made between the captains, and the\ncrews took it up in their own way; but as she was bound to leeward\nand we to windward, and merchant captains cannot deviate, a trial\nnever took place; and perhaps it was well for us that it did not,\nfor the Ayacucho had been eight years in the Pacific, in every part\nof it–Valparaiso, Sandwich Islands, Canton, California, and all,\nand was called the fastest merchantman that traded in the Pacific,\nunless it was the brig John Gilpin, and perhaps the ship Ann McKim\nof Baltimore.",
        "Saturday, Nov. 14th.  This day we got under weigh, with the agent\nand several Spaniards of note, as passengers, bound up to Monterey.\nWe went ashore in the gig to bring them off with their baggage,\nand found them waiting on the beach, and a little afraid about\ngoing off, as the surf was running very high.  This was nuts to\nus; for we liked to have a Spaniard wet with salt water; and then\nthe agent was very much disliked by the crew, one and all; and we\nhoped, as there was no officer in the boat, to have a chance to\nduck them; for we knew that they were such “marines” that they\nwould not know whether it was our fault or not.  Accordingly,\nwe kept the boat so far from shore as to oblige them to wet their\nfeet in getting into her; and then waited for a good high comber,\nand letting the head slue a little round, sent the whole force of\nthe sea into the stern-sheets, drenching them from head to feet.\nThe Spaniards sprang out of the boat, swore, and shook themselves\nand protested against trying it again; and it was with the greatest\ndifficulty that the agent could prevail upon them to make another\nattempt.  The next time we took care, and went off easily enough,\nand pulled aboard.  The crew came to the side to hoist in their\nbaggage, and we gave them the wink, and they heartily enjoyed the\nhalf-drowned looks of the company.",
        "Everything being now ready, and the passengers aboard, we ran up\nthe ensign and broad pennant, (for there was no man-of-war, and\nwe were the largest vessel on the coast,) and the other vessels\nran up their ensigns.  Having hove short, cast off the gaskets,\nand made the bunt of each sail fast by the jigger, with a man on\neach yard; at the word, the whole canvas of the ship was loosed,\nand with the greatest rapidity possible, everything was sheeted\nhome and hoisted up, the anchor tripped and catheaded, and the\nship under headway.  We were determined to show the “spouter” how\nthings could be done in a smart ship, with a good crew, though not\nmore than half their number.  The royal yards were all crossed at\nonce, and royals and skysails set, and, as we had the wind free,\nthe booms were run out, and every one was aloft, active as cats,\nlaying out on the yards and booms, reeving the studding-sail gear;\nand sail after sail the captain piled upon her, until she was covered\nwith canvas, her sails looking like a great white cloud resting\nupon a black speck.  Before we doubled the point, we were going\nat a dashing rate, and leaving the shipping far astern.  We had\na fine breeze to take us through the Canal, as they call this bay\nof forty miles long by ten wide.  The breeze died away at night,\nand we were becalmed all day on Sunday, about half way between\nSanta Barbara and Point Conception.  Sunday night we had a light,\nfair wind, which set us up again; and having a fine sea-breeze on\nthe first part of Monday, we had the prospect of passing, without\nany trouble, Point Conception,–the Cape Horn of California,\nwhere it begins to blow the first of January, and blows all the\nyear round.  Toward the latter part of the afternoon, however,\nthe regular northwest wind, as usual, set in, which brought in our\nstudding-sails, and gave us the chance of beating round the Point,\nwhich we were now just abreast of, and which stretched off into the\nPacific, high, rocky and barren, forming the central point of the\ncoast for hundreds of miles north and south.  A cap-full of wind\nwill be a bag-full here, and before night our royals were furled,\nand the ship was laboring hard under her top-gallant sails.  At eight\nbells our watch went below, leaving her with as much sail as she\ncould stagger under, the water flying over the forecastle at every\nplunge.  It was evidently blowing harder, but then there was not a\ncloud in the sky, and the sun had gone down bright.",
        "We had been below but a short time, before we had the usual\npremonitions of a coming gale: seas washing over the whole\nforward part of the vessel, and her bows beating against them\nwith a force and sound like the driving of piles.  The watch,\ntoo, seemed very busy trampling about decks, and singing out at\nthe ropes.  A sailor can always tell, by the sound, what sail is\ncoming in, and, in a short time, we heard the top-gallant sails\ncome in, one after another, and then the flying jib.  This seemed\nto ease her a good deal, and we were fast going off to the land\nof Nod, when–bang, bang, bang–on the scuttle, and “All hands,\nreef topsails, ahoy!” started us out of our berths; and, it not\nbeing very cold weather, we had nothing extra to put on, and were\nsoon on deck.  I shall never forget the fineness of the sight.\nIt was a clear, and rather a chilly night; the stars were twinkling\nwith an intense brightness, and as far as the eye could reach,\nthere was not a cloud to be seen.  The horizon met the sea in a\ndefined line.  A painter could not have painted so clear a sky.\nThere was not a speck upon it.  Yet it was blowing great guns from\nthe north-west.  When you can see a cloud to windward, you feel that\nthere is a place for the wind to come from; but here it seemed to\ncome from nowhere.  No person could have told, from the heavens,\nby their eyesight alone, that it was not a still summer’s night.\nOne reef after another, we took in the topsails, and before\nwe could get them hoisted up, we heard a sound like a short,\nquick rattling of thunder, and the jib was blown to atoms out of\nthe bolt-rope.  We got the topsails set, and the fragments of the\njib stowed away, and the fore-topmast staysail set in its place,\nwhen the great mainsail gaped open, and the sail ripped from head\nto foot.  “Lay up on that main-yard and furl the sail, before it\nblows to tatters!” shouted the captain; and in a moment, we were\nup, gathering the remains of it upon the yard.  We got it wrapped,\nround the yard, and passed gaskets over it as snugly as possible,\nand were just on deck again, when, with another loud rent,\nwhich was heard throughout the ship, the fore-topsail, which had\nbeen double-reefed, split in two, athwartships, just below the\nreefband, from earing to earing.  Here again it was down yard,\nhaul out reef-tackles, and lay out upon the yard for reefing.\nBy hauling the reef-tackles chock-a-block, we took the strain\nfrom the other earings, and passing the close-reef earing,\nand knotting the points carefully, we succeeded in setting\nthe sail, close-reefed.",
        "We had but just got the rigging coiled up, and were waiting to\nhear “go below the watch!” when the main royal worked loose from\nthe gaskets, and blew directly out to leeward, flapping, and shaking\nthe mast like a wand.  Here was a job for somebody.  The royal must\ncome in or be cut adrift, or the mast would be snapped short off.\nAll the light hands in the starboard watch were sent up, one after\nanother, but they could do nothing with it.  At length, John,\nthe tall Frenchman, the head of the starboard watch, (and a better\nsailor never stepped upon a deck,) sprang aloft, and, by the help\nof his long arms and legs, succeeded, after a hard struggle,–the\nsail blowing over the yard-arm to leeward, and the skysail blowing\ndirectly over his head–in smothering it, and frapping it with long\npieces of sinnet.  He came very near being blown or shaken from\nthe yard, several times, but he was a true sailor, every finger\na fish-hook.  Having made the sail snug, he prepared to send the\nyard down, which was a long and difficult job; for, frequently,\nhe was obliged to stop and hold on with all his might, for several\nminutes, the ship pitching so as to make it impossible to do\nanything else at that height.  The yard at length came down\nsafe, and after it, the fore and mizen royal-yards were sent\ndown.  All hands were then sent aloft, and for an hour or two\nwe were hard at work, making the booms well fast; unreeving the\nstudding-sail and royal and skysail gear; getting rolling-ropes\non the yards; setting up the weather breast-backstays; and making\nother preparations for a storm.  It was a fine night for a gale;\njust cool and bracing enough for quick work, without being cold,\nand as bright as day.  It was sport to have a gale in such weather\nas this.  Yet it blew like a hurricane.  The wind seemed to come\nwith a spite, an edge to it, which threatened to scrape us off\nthe yards.  The mere force of the wind was greater than I had\never seen it before; but darkness, cold, and wet are the worst\nparts of a storm to a sailor.",
        "Having got on deck again, we looked round to see what time of\nnight it was, and whose watch.  In a few minutes the man at the\nwheel struck four bells, and we found that the other watch was out,\nand our own half out.  Accordingly, the starboard watch went below,\nand left the ship to us for a couple of hours, yet with orders to\nstand by for a call.",
        "Hardly had they got below, before away went the fore-topmast staysail,\nblown to ribbons.  This was a small sail, which we could manage in\nthe watch, so that we were not obliged to call up the other watch.\nWe laid out upon the bowsprit, where we were under water half the\ntime, and took in the fragments of the sail, and as she must have\nsome head sail on her, prepared to bend another staysail.  We got\nthe new one out, into the nettings; seized on the tack, sheets,\nand halyards, and the hanks; manned the halyards, cut adrift the\nfrapping lines, and hoisted away; but before it was half way up\nthe stay, it was blown all to pieces.  When we belayed the halyards,\nthere was nothing left but the bolt-rope.  Now large eyes began to\nshow themselves in the foresail, and knowing that it must soon go,\nthe mate ordered us upon the yard to furl it.  Being unwilling to\ncall up the watch who had been on deck all night, he roused out the\ncarpenter, sailmaker, cook, steward, and other idlers, and,\nwith their help, we manned the foreyard, and after nearly half an\nhour’s struggle, mastered the sail, and got it well furled round\nthe yard.  The force of the wind had never been greater than at\nthis moment.  In going up the rigging, it seemed absolutely to pin\nus down to the shrouds; and on the yard, there was no such thing\nas turning a face to windward.  Yet here was no driving sleet,\nand darkness, and wet, and cold, as off Cape Horn; and instead of\na stiff oil-cloth suit, south-wester caps, and thick boots, we had\non hats, round jackets, duck trowsers, light shoes, and everything\nlight and easy.  All these things make a great difference to a\nsailor.  When we got on deck, the man at the wheel struck eight\nbells, (four o’clock in the morning,) and “All starbowlines,\nahoy!” brought the other watch up.  But there was no going below\nfor us.  The gale was now at its height, “blowing like scissors\nand thumb-screws;” the captain was on deck; the ship, which was\nlight, rolling and pitching as though she would shake the long\nsticks out of her; and the sail gaping open and splitting, in\nevery direction.  The mizen topsail, which was a comparatively\nnew sail, and close-reefed, split, from head to foot, in the\nbunt; the fore-topsail went, in one rent, from clew to earing,\nand was blowing to tatters; one of the chain bobstays parted;\nthe spritsail-yard sprung in the slings; the martingale had slued\naway off to leeward; and, owing to the long dry weather, the lee\nrigging hung in large bights, at every lurch.  One of the main\ntop-gallant shrouds had parted; and, to crown all, the galley had\ngot adrift, and gone over to leeward, and the anchor on the lee\nbow had worked loose, and was thumping the side.  Here was work\nenough for all hands for half a day.  Our gang laid out on the\nmizen topsail yard, and after more than half an hour’s hard work,\nfurled the sail, though it bellied out over our heads, and again,\nby a slant of the wind, blew in under the yard, with a fearful\njerk, and almost threw us off from the foot-ropes.",
        "Double gaskets were passed round the yards, rolling tackles and\nother gear bowsed taught, and everything made as secure as could\nbe.  Coming down, we found the rest of the crew just coming down\nthe fore rigging, having furled the tattered topsail, or, rather,\nswathed it round the yard, which looked like a broken limb, bandaged.\nThere was no sail now on the ship but the spanker and the close-reefed\nmain topsail, which still held good.  But this was too much after\nsail; and order was given to furl the spanker.  The brails were\nhauled up, and all the light hands in the starboard watch sent\nout on the gaff to pass the gaskets; but they could do nothing\nwith it.  The second mate swore at them for a parcel of “sogers,\"\nand sent up a couple of the best men; but they could do no better,\nand the gaff was lowered down.  All hands were now employed in\nsetting up the lee rigging, fishing the spritsail-yard, lashing\nthe galley, and getting tackles upon the martingale, to bowse it\nto windward.  Being in the larboard watch, my duty was forward,\nto assist in setting up the martingale.  Three of us were out on\nthe martingale guys and back-ropes for more than half an hour,\ncarrying out, hooking and unhooking the tackles, several times\nburied in the seas, until the mate ordered us in, from fear of\nour being washed off.  The anchors were then to be taken up on\nthe rail, which kept all hands on the forecastle for an hour,\nthough every now and then the seas broke over it, washing the\nrigging off to leeward, filling the lee scuppers breast high,\nand washing chock aft to the taffrail.",
        "Having got everything secure again, we were promising ourselves\nsome breakfast, for it was now nearly nine o’clock in the forenoon,\nwhen the main topsail showed evident signs of giving way.  Some sail\nmust be kept on the ship, and the captain ordered the fore and main\nspencer gaffs to be lowered down, and the two spencers (which were\nstorm sails, bran new, small, and made of the strongest canvas)\nto be got up and bent; leaving the main topsail to blow away,\nwith a blessing on it, if it would only last until we could set\nthe spencers.  These we bent on very carefully, with strong robands\nand seizings, and making tackles fast to the clews, bowsed them down\nto the water-ways.  By this time the main topsail was among the\nthings that have been, and we went aloft to stow away the remnant\nof the last sail of all those which were on the ship twenty-four\nhours before.  The spencers were now the only whole sails on the\nship, and, being strong and small, and near the deck, presenting\nbut little surface to the wind above the rail, promised to hold\nout well.  Hove-to under these, and eased by having no sail above\nthe tops, the ship rose and fell, and drifted off to leeward like\na line-of-battle ship.",
        "It was now eleven o’clock, and the watch was sent below to\nget breakfast, and at eight bells (noon), as everything was\nsnug, although the gale had not in the least abated, the watch\nwas set, and the other watch and idlers sent below.  For three\ndays and three nights, the gale continued with unabated fury,\nand with singular regularity.  There was no lulls, and very\nlittle variation in its fierceness.  Our ship, being light,\nrolled so as almost to send the fore yard-arm under water,\nand drifted off bodily, to leeward.  All this time there was\nnot a cloud to be seen in the sky, day or night;–no, not so\nlarge as a man’s hand.  Every morning the sun rose cloudless\nfrom the sea, and set again at night, in the sea, in a flood of\nlight.  The stars, too, came out of the blue, one after another,\nnight after night, unobscured, and twinkled as clear as on a still\nfrosty night at home, until the day came upon them.  All this time,\nthe sea was rolling in immense surges, white with foam, as far as\nthe eye could reach, on every side, for we were now leagues and\nleagues from shore.",
        "The between-decks being empty, several of us slept there in hammocks,\nwhich are the best things in the world to sleep in during a storm;\nit not being true of them, as it is of another kind of bed, “when the\nwind blows, the cradle will rock;” for it is the ship that rocks,\nwhile they always hang vertically from the beams.  During these\nseventy-two hours we had nothing to do, but to turn in and out,\nfour hours on deck, and four below, eat, sleep, and keep watch.\nThe watches were only varied by taking the helm in turn, and now\nand then, by one of the sails, which were furled, blowing out of\nthe gaskets, and getting adrift, which sent us up on the yards;\nand by getting tackles on different parts of the rigging, which were\nslack.  Once, the wheel-rope parted, which might have been fatal\nto us, had not the chief mate sprung instantly with a relieving\ntackle to windward, and kept the tiller up, till a new one could\nbe rove.  On the morning of the twentieth, at daybreak, the gale\nhad evidently done its worst, and had somewhat abated; so much so,\nthat all hands were called to bend new sails, although it was still\nblowing as hard as two common gales.  One at a time, and with great\ndifficulty and labor, the old sails were unbent and sent down\nby the bunt-lines, and three new topsails, made for the homeward\npassage round Cape Horn, and which had never been bent, were got\nup from the sailroom, and under the care of the sailmaker, were\nfitted for bending, and sent up by the halyards into the tops, and,\nwith stops and frapping lines, were bent to the yards, close-reefed,\nsheeted home, and hoisted.  These were done one at a time, and with\nthe greatest care and difficulty.  Two spare courses were then\ngot up and bent in the same manner and furled, and a storm-jib,\nwith the bonnet off, bent and furled to the boom.  It was twelve\no’clock before we got through; and five hours of more exhausting\nlabor I never experienced; and no one of that ship’s crew, I will\nventure to say, will ever desire again to unbend and bend five large\nsails, in the teeth of a tremendous north-wester.  Towards night,\na few clouds appeared in the horizon, and as the gale moderated,\nthe usual appearance of driving clouds relieved the face of the sky.\nThe fifth day after the commencement of the storm, we shook a reef\nout of each topsail, and set the reefed foresail, jib and spanker;\nbut it was not until after eight days of reefed topsails that we\nhad a whole sail on the ship; and then it was quite soon enough,\nfor the captain was anxious to make up for leeway, the gale having\nblown us half the distance to the Sandwich Islands.",
        "Inch by inch, as fast as the gale would permit, we made sail on the\nship, for the wind still continued a-head, and we had many days’\nsailing to get back to the longitude we were in when the storm\ntook us.  For eight days more we beat to windward under a stiff\ntop-gallant breeze, when the wind shifted and became variable.\nA light south-easter, to which we could carry a reefed topmast\nstudding-sail, did wonders for our dead reckoning.",
        "Friday, December 4th, after a passage of twenty days, we arrived\nat the mouth of the bay of San Francisco.",
        "Our place of destination had been Monterey, but as we were to the\nnorthward of it when the wind hauled a-head, we made a fair wind\nfor San Francisco.  This large bay, which lies in latitude 37° 58’,\nwas discovered by Sir Francis Drake, and by him represented to\nbe (as indeed it is) a magnificent bay, containing several good\nharbors, great depth of water, and surrounded by a fertile and\nfinely wooded country.  About thirty miles from the mouth of the\nbay, and on the south-east side, is a high point, upon which the\npresidio is built.  Behind this, is the harbor in which trading\nvessels anchor, and near it, the mission of San Francisco, and a\nnewly begun settlement, mostly of Yankee Californians, called Yerba\nBuena, which promises well.  Here, at anchor, and the only vessel,\nwas a brig under Russian colors, from Asitka, in Russian America,\nwhich had come down to winter, and to take in a supply of tallow\nand grain, great quantities of which latter article are raised\nin the missions at the head of the bay.  The second day after\nour arrival, we went on board the brig, it being Sunday, as a\nmatter of curiosity; and there was enough there to gratify it.\nThough no larger than the Pilgrim, she had five or six officers,\nand a crew of between twenty and thirty; and such a stupid and\ngreasy-looking set, I certainly never saw before.  Although it\nwas quite comfortable weather, and we had nothing on but straw\nhats, shirts, and duck trowsers, and were barefooted, they had,\nevery man of them, double-soled boots, coming up to the knees,\nand well greased; thick woolen trowsers, frocks, waistcoats,\npea-jackets, woolen caps, and everything in true Nova Zembla\nrig; and in the warmest days they made no change.  The clothing\nof one of these men would weigh nearly as much as that of half\nour crew.  They had brutish faces, looked like the antipodes of\nsailors, and apparently dealt in nothing but grease.  They lived\nupon grease; eat it, drank it, slept in the midst of it, and their\nclothes were covered with it.  To a Russian, grease is the greatest\nluxury.  They looked with greedy eyes upon the tallow-bags as they\nwere taken into the vessel, and, no doubt, would have eaten one up\nwhole, had not the officer kept watch over it.  The grease seemed\nactually coming through their pores, and out in their hair, and on\ntheir faces.  It seems as if it were this saturation which makes\nthem stand cold and rain so well.  If they were to go into a warm\nclimate, they would all die of the scurvy.",
        "The vessel was no better than the crew.  Everything was in the oldest\nand most inconvenient fashion possible; running trusses on the yards,\nand large hawser cables, coiled all over the decks, and served and\nparcelled in all directions.  The topmasts, top-gallant masts and\nstudding-sail booms were nearly black for want of scraping, and\nthe decks would have turned the stomach of a man-of-war’s-man.\nThe galley was down in the forecastle; and there the crew lived,\nin the midst of the steam and grease of the cooking, in a place\nas hot as an oven, and as dirty as a pigsty.  Five minutes in\nthe forecastle was enough for us, and we were glad to get into the\nopen air.  We made some trade with them, buying Indian curiosities,\nof which they had a great number; such as bead-work, feathers of\nbirds, fur moccasins, etc.  I purchased a large robe, made of the\nskins of some animals, dried and sewed nicely together, and covered\nall over on the outside with thick downy feathers, taken from the\nbreasts of various birds, and arranged with their different colors,\nso as to make a brilliant show.",
        "A few days after our arrival, the rainy season set in, and,\nfor three weeks, it rained almost every hour, without cessation.\nThis was bad for our trade, for the collecting of hides is managed\ndifferently in this port from what it is in any other on the coast.\nThe mission of San Francisco near the anchorage, has no trade at\nall, but those of San José, Santa Clara, and others, situated on\nlarge creeks or rivers which run into the bay, and distant between\nfifteen and forty miles from the anchorage, do a greater business\nin hides than any in California.  Large boats, manned by Indians,\nand capable of carrying nearly a thousand hides apiece, are attached\nto the missions, and sent down to the vessels with hides, to bring\naway goods in return.  Some of the crews of the vessels are obliged\nto go and come in the boats, to look out for the hides and goods.\nThese are favorite expeditions with the sailors, in fine weather;\nbut now to be gone three or four days, in open boats, in constant\nrain, without any shelter, and with cold food, was hard service.\nTwo of our men went up to Santa Clara in one of these boats,\nand were gone three days, during all which time they had a\nconstant rain, and did not sleep a wink, but passed three long\nnights, walking fore and aft the boat, in the open air.  When they\ngot on board, they were completely exhausted, and took a watch\nbelow of twelve hours.  All the hides, too, that came down in the\nboats, were soaked with water, and unfit to put below, so that we\nwere obliged to trice them up to dry, in the intervals of sunshine\nor wind, upon all parts of the vessel.  We got up tricing-lines\nfrom the jib-boom-end to each arm of the fore yard, and thence to\nthe main and cross-jack yard-arms.  Between the tops, too, and the\nmast-heads, from the fore to the main swifters, and thence to the\nmizen rigging, and in all directions athwartships, tricing-lines\nwere run, and strung with hides.  The head stays and guys, and the\nspritsail-yard, were lined, and, having still more, we got out the\nswinging booms, and strung them and the forward and after guys,\nwith hides.  The rail, fore and aft, the windlass, capstan, the\nsides of the ship, and every vacant place on deck, were covered\nwith wet hides, on the least sign of an interval for drying.\nOur ship was nothing but a mass of hides, from the cat-harpins\nto the water’s edge, and from the jib-boom-end to the taffrail.",
        "One cold, rainy evening, about eight o’clock, I received orders to\nget ready to start for San José at four the next morning, in one of\nthese Indian boats, with four days’ provisions.  I got my oil-cloth\nclothes, south-wester, and thick boots all ready, and turned into\nmy hammock early, determined to get some sleep in advance, as the\nboat was to be alongside before daybreak.  I slept on till all hands\nwere called in the morning; for, fortunately for me, the Indians,\nintentionally, or from mistaking their orders, had gone off alone\nin the night, and were far out of sight.  Thus I escaped three or\nfour days of very uncomfortable service.",
        "Four of our men, a few days afterwards, went up in one of the\nquarter-boats to Santa Clara, to carry the agent, and remained\nout all night in a drenching rain, in the small boat, where there\nwas not room for them to turn round; the agent having gone up to\nthe mission and left the men to their fate, making no provision\nfor their accommodation, and not even sending them anything\nto eat.  After this, they had to pull thirty miles, and when\nthey got on board, were so stiff that they could not come up\nthe gangway ladder.  This filled up the measure of the agent’s\nunpopularity, and never after this could he get anything done by\nany of the crew; and many a delay and vexation, and many a good\nducking in the surf, did he get to pay up old scores, or “square\nthe yards with the bloody quill-driver.”",
        "Having collected nearly all the hides that were to be procured,\nwe began our preparations for taking in a supply of wood and water,\nfor both of which, San Francisco is the best place on the coast.\nA small island, situated about two leagues from the anchorage,\ncalled by us “Wood Island,” and by the Spaniards “Isle de los\nAngelos,” was covered with trees to the water’s edge; and to\nthis, two of our crew, who were Kennebec men, and could handle\nan axe like a plaything, were sent every morning to cut wood,\nwith two boys to pile it up for them.  In about a week, they had\ncut enough to last us a year, and the third mate, with myself\nand three others, were sent over in a large, schooner-rigged,\nopen launch, which we had hired of the mission, to take in the\nwood, and bring it to the ship.  We left the ship about noon, but,\nowing to a strong head wind, and a tide, which here runs four or\nfive knots, did not get into the harbor, formed by two points of\nthe island, where the boats lie, until sundown.  No sooner had we\ncome-to, than a strong south-easter, which had been threatening\nus all day, set in, with heavy rain and a chilly atmosphere.\nWe were in rather a bad situation: an open boat, a heavy rain,\nand a long night; for in winter, in this latitude, it was dark\nnearly fifteen hours.  Taking a small skiff which we had brought\nwith us, we went ashore, but found no shelter, for everything was\nopen to the rain, and collecting a little wood, which we found by\nlifting up the leaves and brush, and a few muscles, we put aboard\nagain, and made the best preparations in our power for passing\nthe night.  We unbent the mainsail, and formed an awning with it\nover the after part of the boat, made a bed of wet logs of wood,\nand, with our jackets on, lay down, about six o’clock, to sleep.\nFinding the rain running down upon us, and our jackets getting wet\nthrough, and the rough, knotty-logs, rather indifferent couches,\nwe turned out; and taking an iron pan which we brought with us,\nwe wiped it out dry, put some stones around it, cut the wet bark\nfrom some sticks, and striking a light, made a small fire in the\npan.  Keeping some sticks near, to dry, and covering the whole\nover with a roof of boards, we kept up a small fire, by which\nwe cooked our muscles, and eat them, rather for an occupation\nthan from hunger.  Still, it was not ten o’clock, and the night\nwas long before us, when one of the party produced an old pack\nof Spanish cards from his monkey-jacket pocket, which we hailed\nas a great windfall; and keeping a dim, flickering light by our\nfagots, we played game after game, till one or two o’clock, when,\nbecoming really tired, we went to our logs again, one sitting up\nat a time, in turn, to keep watch over the fire.  Toward morning,\nthe rain ceased, and the air became sensibly colder, so that we found\nsleep impossible, and sat up, watching for daybreak.  No sooner\nwas it light than we went ashore, and began our preparations for\nloading our vessel.  We were not mistaken in the coldness of the\nweather, for a white frost was on the ground, a thing we had never\nseen before in California, and one or two little puddles of fresh\nwater were skimmed over with a thin coat of ice.  In this state\nof the weather and before sunrise, in the grey of the morning,\nwe had to wade off, nearly up to our hips in water, to load\nthe skiff with the wood by armsfull.  The third mate remained\non board the launch, two more men staid in the skiff, to load\nand manage it, and all the water-work, as usual, fell upon the\ntwo youngest of us; and there we were, with frost on the ground,\nwading forward and back, from the beach to the boat, with armsfull\nof wood, barefooted, and our trowsers rolled up.  When the skiff\nwent off with her load, we could only keep our feet from freezing\nby racing up and down the beach on the hard sand, as fast as we\ncould go.  We were all day at this work, and towards sundown,\nhaving loaded the vessel as deep as she would bear, we hove up\nour anchor, and made sail, beating out the bay.  No sooner had\nwe got into the large bay, than we found a strong tide setting\nus out to seaward, a thick fog which prevented our seeing the\nship, and a breeze too light to set us against the tide; for we\nwere as deep as a sand-barge.  By the utmost exertions, we saved\nourselves from being carried out to sea, and were glad to reach the\nleewardmost point of the island, where we came-to, and prepared\nto pass another night, more uncomfortable than the first, for we\nwere loaded up to the gunwale, and had only a choice among logs\nand sticks for a resting-place.  The next morning, we made sail at\nslack water, with a fair wind, and got on board by eleven o’clock,\nwhen all hands were turned-to, to unload and stow away the wood,\nwhich took till night.",
        "Having now taken in all our wood, the next morning a water-party\nwas ordered off with all the casks.  From this we escaped, having\nhad a pretty good siege with the wooding.  The water-party were\ngone three days, during which time they narrowly escaped being\ncarried out to sea, and passed one day on an island, where one\nof them shot a deer, great numbers of which overrun the islands\nand hills of San Francisco Bay.",
        "While not off, on these wood and water parties, or up the rivers\nto the missions, we had very easy times on board the ship.  We were\nmoored, stem and stern, within a cable’s length of the shore, safe\nfrom south-easters, and with very little boating to do; and as it\nrained nearly all the time, awnings were put over the hatchways,\nand all hands sent down between decks, where we were at work,\nday after day, picking oakum, until we got enough to caulk the ship\nall over, and to last the whole voyage.  Then we made a whole suit\nof gaskets for the voyage home, a pair of wheel-ropes from strips\nof green hide, great quantities of spun-yarn, and everything else\nthat could be made between decks.  It being now mid-winter and\nin high latitude, the nights were very long, so that we were not\nturned-to until seven in the morning, and were obliged to knock\noff at five in the evening, when we got supper; which gave us\nnearly three hours before eight bells, at which time the watch\nwas set.",
        "As we had now been about a year on the coast, it was time to think\nof the voyage home; and knowing that the last two or three months\nof our stay would be very busy ones, and that we should never have\nso good an opportunity to work for ourselves as the present, we all\nemployed our evenings in making clothes for the passage home, and more\nespecially for Cape Horn.  As soon as supper was over and the kids\ncleared away, and each one had taken his smoke, we seated ourselves\non our chests round the lamp, which swung from a beam, and each one\nwent to work in his own way, some making hats, others trowsers,\nothers jackets, etc., etc.; and no one was idle.  The boys who\ncould not sew well enough to make their own clothes, laid up grass\ninto sinnet for the men, who sewed for them in return.  Several of\nus clubbed together and bought a large piece of twilled cotton,\nwhich we made into trowsers and jackets, and giving them several\ncoats of linseed oil, laid them by for Cape Horn.  I also sewed\nand covered a tarpaulin hat, thick and strong enough to sit down\nupon, and made myself a complete suit of flannel under-clothing,\nfor bad weather.  Those who had no south-wester caps, made them,\nand several of the crew made themselves tarpaulin jackets and\ntrowsers, lined on the inside with flannel.  Industry was the order\nof the day, and every one did something for himself; for we knew\nthat as the season advanced, and we went further south, we should\nhave no evenings to work in.",
        "Friday, December 25th.  This day was Christmas; and as it rained\nall day long, and there were no hides to take in, and nothing\nespecial to do, the captain gave us a holiday, (the first we had\nhad since leaving Boston,) and plum duff for dinner.  The Russian\nbrig, following the Old Style, had celebrated their Christmas\neleven days before; when they had a grand blow-out and (as our\nmen said) drank, in the forecastle, a barrel of gin, ate up a\nbag of tallow, and made a soup of the skin.",
        "Sunday, December 27th.  We had now finished all our business at\nthis port, and it being Sunday, we unmoored ship and got under\nweigh, firing a salute to the Russian brig, and another to the\nPresidio, which were both answered.  The commandant of the Presidio,\nDon Gaudaloupe Villego, a young man, and the most popular, among the\nAmericans and English, of any man in California, was on board when\nwe got under weigh.  He spoke English very well, and was suspected\nof being favorably inclined to foreigners.",
        "We sailed down this magnificent bay with a light wind, the tide,\nwhich was running out, carrying us at the rate of four or five\nknots.  It was a fine day; the first of entire sunshine we had\nhad for more than a month.  We passed directly under the high\ncliff on which the Presidio is built, and stood into the middle\nof the bay, from whence we could see small bays, making up into\nthe interior, on every side; large and beautifully-wooded islands;\nand the mouths of several small rivers.  If California ever becomes\na prosperous country, this bay will be the centre of its prosperity.\nThe abundance of wood and water, the extreme fertility of its shores,\nthe excellence of its climate, which is as near to being perfect as\nany in the world, and its facilities for navigation, affording the\nbest anchoring-grounds in the whole western coast of America,\nall fit it for a place of great importance; and, indeed, it has\nattracted much attention, for the settlement of “Yerba Buena,\"\nwhere we lay at anchor, made chiefly by Americans and English,\nand which bids fair to become the most important trading place on\nthe coast, at this time began to supply traders, Russian ships,\nand whalers, with their stores of wheat and frijoles.",
        "The tide leaving us, we came to anchor near the mouth of the bay,\nunder a high and beautifully sloping hill, upon which herds of\nhundreds and hundreds of red deer, and the stag, with his high\nbranching antlers, were bounding about, looking at us for a moment,\nand then starting off, affrighted at the noises which we made for\nthe purpose of seeing the variety of their beautiful attitudes\nand motions.",
        "At midnight, the tide having turned, we hove up our anchor and\nstood out of the bay, with a fine starry heaven above us,–the\nfirst we had seen for weeks and weeks.  Before the light northerly\nwinds, which blow here with the regularity of trades, we worked\nslowly along, and made Point Año Nuevo, the northerly point of\nthe Bay of Monterey, on Monday afternoon.  We spoke, going in,\nthe brig Diana, of the Sandwich Islands, from the North-west Coast,\nlast from Asitka.  She was off the point at the same time with us,\nbut did not get in to the anchoring-ground until an hour or two\nafter us.  It was ten o’clock on Tuesday morning when we came\nto anchor.  The town looked just as it did when I saw it last,\nwhich was eleven months before, in the brig Pilgrim.  The pretty\nlawn on which it stands, as green as sun and rain could make it;\nthe pine wood on the south; the small river on the north side;\nthe houses, with their white plastered sides and red-tiled roofs,\ndotted about on the green; the low, white presidio, with its soiled,\ntri-colored flag flying, and the discordant din of drums and trumpets\nfor the noon parade; all brought up the scene we had witnessed here\nwith so much pleasure nearly a year before, when coming from a\nlong voyage, and our unprepossessing reception at Santa Barbara.\nIt seemed almost like coming to a home.",
        "The only other vessel in port was the Russian government bark,\nfrom Asitka, mounting eight guns, (four of which we found to be\nQuakers,) and having on board the ex-governor, who was going in\nher to Mazatlan, and thence overland to Vera Cruz.  He offered\nto take letters, and deliver them to the American consul at\nVera Cruz, whence they could be easily forwarded to the United\nStates.  We accordingly made up a packet of letters, almost every\none writing, and dating them “January 1st, 1836.”  The governor\nwas true to his promise, and they all reached Boston before the\nmiddle of March; the shortest communication ever yet made across\nthe country.",
        "The brig Pilgrim had been lying in Monterey through the latter part\nof November, according to orders, waiting for us.  Day after day,\nCaptain Faucon went up to the hill to look out for us, and at last,\ngave us up, thinking we must have gone down in the gale which we\nexperienced off Point Conception, and which had blown with great\nfury over the whole coast, driving ashore several vessels in the\nsnuggest ports.  An English brig, which had put into San Francisco,\nlost both her anchors; the Rosa was driven upon a mud bank in\nSan Diego; and the Pilgrim, with great difficulty, rode out the\ngale in Monterey, with three anchors a-head.  She sailed early\nin December for San Diego and intermedios.",
        "As we were to be here over Sunday, and Monterey was the best place\nto go ashore on the whole coast, and we had had no liberty-day for\nnearly three months, every one was for going ashore.  On Sunday morning,\nas soon as the decks were washed, and we had got breakfast, those who\nhad obtained liberty began to clean themselves, as it is called,\nto go ashore.  A bucket of fresh water apiece, a cake of soap,\na large coarse towel, and we went to work scrubbing one another,\non the forecastle.  Having gone through this, the next thing was\nto get into the head,–one on each side–with a bucket apiece,\nand duck one another, by drawing up water and heaving over each\nother, while we were stripped to a pair of trowsers.  Then came\nthe rigging-up.  The usual outfit of pumps, white stockings,\nloose white duck trowsers, blue jackets, clean checked shirts,\nblack kerchiefs, hats well varnished, with a fathom of black\nribbon over the left eye, a silk handkerchief flying from the\noutside jacket pocket, and four or five dollars tied up in the\nback of the neckerchief, and we were “all right.”  One of the\nquarter-boats pulled us ashore, and we steamed up to the town.\nI tried to find the church, in order to see the worship, but was told\nthat there was no service, except a mass early in the morning; so we\nwent about the town, visiting the Americans and English, and the\nnatives whom we had known when we were here before.  Toward noon\nwe procured horses, and rode out to the Carmel mission, which is\nabout a league from the town, where we got something in the way\nof a dinner–beef, eggs, frijoles, tortillas, and some middling\nwine–from the mayordomo, who, of course, refused to make any\ncharge, as it was the Lord’s gift, yet received our present,\nas a gratuity, with a low bow, a touch of the hat, and “Dios\nse lo pague!”",
        "After this repast, we had a fine run, scouring the whole country\non our fleet horses, and came into town soon after sundown.\nHere we found our companions who had refused to go to ride\nwith us, thinking that a sailor has no more business with a horse\nthan a fish has with a balloon.  They were moored, stem and stern,\nin a grog-shop, making a great noise, with a crowd of Indians and\nhungry half-breeds about them, and with a fair prospect of being\nstripped and dirked, or left to pass the night in the calabozo.\nWith a great deal of trouble, we managed to get them down to the\nboats, though not without many angry looks and interferences from\nthe Spaniards, who had marked them out for their prey.  The Diana’s\ncrew,–a set of worthless outcasts, who had been picked up at the\nislands from the refuse of whale-ships,–were all as drunk as beasts,\nand had a set-to, on the beach, with their captain, who was in no\nbetter state than themselves.  They swore they would not go aboard,\nand went back to the town, were stripped and beaten, and lodged in\nthe calabozo, until the next day, when the captain bought them out.\nOur forecastle, as usual after a liberty-day, was a scene of tumult\nall night long, from the drunken ones.  They had just got to sleep\ntoward morning, when they were turned up with the rest, and kept at\nwork all day in the water, carrying hides, their heads aching so that\nthey could hardly stand.  This is sailor’s pleasure.",
        "Nothing worthy of remark happened while we were here, except a little\nboxing-match on board our own ship, which gave us something to talk\nabout.  A broad-backed, big-headed Cape Cod boy, about sixteen\nyears old, had been playing the bully, for the whole voyage,\nover a slender, delicate-looking boy, from one of the Boston\nschools, and over whom he had much the advantage, in strength,\nage, and experience in the ship’s duty, for this was the first\ntime the Boston boy had been on salt water.  The latter, however,\nhad “picked up his crumbs,” was learning his duty, and getting\nstrength and confidence daily; and began to assert his rights\nagainst his oppressor.  Still, the other was his master, and,\nby his superior strength, always tackled with him and threw him\ndown.  One afternoon, before we were turned-to, these boys got\ninto a violent squabble in the between-decks, when George (the\nBoston boy) said he would fight Nat, if he could have fair play.\nThe chief mate heard the noise, dove down the hatchway, hauled them\nboth up on deck, and told them to shake hands and have no more\ntrouble for the voyage, or else they should fight till one gave\nin for beaten.  Finding neither willing to make an offer for\nreconciliation, he called all hands up, (for the captain was\nashore, and he could do as he chose aboard,) ranged the crew\nin the waist, marked a line on the deck, brought the two boys\nup to it, making them “toe the mark;” then made the bight of a\nrope fast to a belaying pin, and stretched it across the deck,\nbringing it just above their waists.  “No striking below the\nrope!”  And there they stood, one on each side of it, face to\nface, and went at it like two game-cocks.  The Cape Cod boy, Nat,\nput in his double-fisters, starting the blood, and bringing the\nblack and blue spots all over the face and arms of the other,\nwhom we expected to see give in every moment: but the more he\nwas hurt, the better he fought.  Time after time he was knocked\nnearly down, but up he came again and faced the mark, as bold as\na lion, again to take the heavy blows, which sounded so as to\nmake one’s heart turn with pity for him.  At length he came up\nto the mark for the last time, his shirt torn from his body, his\nface covered with blood and bruises, and his eyes flashing fire,\nand swore he would stand there until one or the other was killed,\nand set-to like a young fury.  “Hurrah in the bow!” said the men,\ncheering him on.  “Well crowed!”  “Never say die, while there’s\na shot in the locker!”  Nat tried to close with him, knowing his\nadvantage, but the mate stopped that, saying there should be fair\nplay, and no fingering.  Nat then came up to the mark, but looked\nwhite about the mouth, and his blows were not given with half the\nspirit of his first.  He was evidently cowed.  He had always been\nhis master, and had nothing to gain, and everything to lose;\nwhile the other fought for honor and freedom, under a sense of\nwrong.  It would not do.  It was soon over.  Nat gave in; not so\nmuch beaten, as cowed and mortified; and never afterwards tried\nto act the bully on board.  We took George forward, washed him\nin the deck-tub, complimented his pluck, and from this time he\nbecame somebody on board, having fought himself into notice.\nMr. Brown’s plan had a good effect, for there was no more quarrelling\namong the boys for the rest of the voyage.",
        "Wednesday, January 6th.  Set sail from Monterey, with a number of\nSpaniards as passengers, and shaped our course for Santa Barbara.\nThe Diana went out of the bay in company with us, but parted from\nus off Point Pinos, being bound to the Sandwich Islands.  We had a\nsmacking breeze for several hours, and went along at a great rate,\nuntil night, when it died away, as usual, and the land-breeze set in,\nwhich brought us upon a taught bowline.  Among our passengers was a\nyoung man who was the best representation of a decayed gentleman\nI had ever seen.  He reminded me much of some of the characters\nin Gil Blas.  He was of the aristocracy of the country, his family\nbeing of pure Spanish blood, and once of great importance in Mexico.\nHis father had been governor of the province, and having amassed a\nlarge property, settled at San Diego, where he built a large house\nwith a court-yard in front, kept a great retinue of Indians, and set\nup for the grandee of that part of the country.  His son was sent\nto Mexico, where he received the best education, and went into the\nfirst society of the capital.  Misfortune, extravagance, and the\nwant of funds, or any manner of getting interest on money,\nsoon eat the estate up, and Don Juan Bandini returned from\nMexico accomplished, poor, and proud, and without any office\nor occupation, to lead the life of most young men of the better\nfamilies–dissolute and extravagant when the means are at hand;\nambitious at heart, and impotent in act; often pinched for bread;\nkeeping up an appearance of style, when their poverty is known to\neach half-naked Indian boy in the street, and they stand in dread of\nevery small trader and shopkeeper in the place.  He had a slight and\nelegant figure, moved gracefully, danced and waltzed beautifully,\nspoke the best of Castilian, with a pleasant and refined voice\nand accent, and had, throughout, the bearing of a man of high\nbirth and figure.  Yet here he was, with his passage given him,\n(as I afterwards learned,) for he had not the means of paying\nfor it, and living upon the charity of our agent.  He was polite\nto every one, spoke to the sailors, and gave four reáls–I dare\nsay the last he had in his pocket–to the steward, who waited\nupon him.  I could not but feel a pity for him, especially when I\nsaw him by the side of his fellow-passenger and townsman, a fat,\ncoarse, vulgar, pretending fellow of a Yankee trader, who had\nmade money in San Diego, and was eating out the very vitals of\nthe Bandinis, fattening upon their extravagance, grinding them in\ntheir poverty; having mortgages on their lands, forestalling their\ncattle, and already making an inroad upon their jewels, which were\ntheir last hope.",
        "Don Juan had with him a retainer, who was as much like many of\nthe characters in Gil Blas as his master.  He called himself a\nprivate secretary, though there was no writing for him to do,\nand he lived in the steerage with the carpenter and sailmaker.\nHe was certainly a character; could read and write extremely well;\nspoke good Spanish; had been all over Spanish America, and lived in\nevery possible situation, and served in every conceivable capacity,\nthough generally in that of confidential servant to some man\nof figure.  I cultivated this man’s acquaintance, and during\nthe five weeks that he was with us,–for he remained on board\nuntil we arrived at San Diego,–I gained a greater knowledge\nof the state of political parties in Mexico, and the habits\nand affairs of the different classes of society, than I could\nhave learned from almost any one else.  He took great pains in\ncorrecting my Spanish, and supplying me with colloquial phrases,\nand common terms and exclamations in speaking.  He lent me a file\nof late newspapers from the city of Mexico, which were full of\ntriumphal receptions of Santa Ana, who had just returned from\nTampico after a victory, and with the preparations for his expedition\nagainst the Texans.  “Viva Santa Ana!” was the by-word everywhere,\nand it had even reached California, though there were still many\nhere, among whom was Don Juan Bandini, who were opposed to his\ngovernment, and intriguing to bring in Bustamente.  Santa Ana,\nthey said, was for breaking down the missions; or, as they termed\nit–\"Santa Ana no quiere religion.”  Yet I had no doubt that the\noffice of administrador of San Diego would reconcile Don Juan to\nany dynasty, and any state of the church.  In these papers, too,\nI found scraps of American and English news; but which were so\nunconnected, and I was so ignorant of everything preceding them\nfor eighteen months past, that they only awakened a curiosity which\nthey could not satisfy.  One article spoke of Taney as Justicia\nMayor de los Estados Unidos, (what had become of Marshall? was he\ndead, or banished?) and another made known, by news received from\nVera Cruz, that “El Vizconde Melbourne” had returned to the office\nof “primer ministro,” in place of Sir Roberto Peel.  (Sir Robert\nPeel had been minister, then? and where were Earl Grey and the Duke\nof Wellington?)  Here were the outlines of a grand parliamentary\noverturn, the filling up of which I could imagine at my leisure.",
        "The second morning after leaving Monterey, we were off Point Conception.\nIt was a bright, sunny day, and the wind, though strong, was fair;\nand everything was in striking contrast with our experience in the\nsame place two months before, when we were drifting off from a\nnorthwester under a fore and main spencer.  “Sail ho!” cried a\nman who was rigging out a top-gallant studding-sail boom.–\"Where\naway?\"–\"Weather beam, sir!” and in a few minutes a full-rigged\nbrig was seen standing out from under Point Conception.  The\nstudding-sail halyards were let go, and the yards boom-ended,\nthe after yards braced aback, and we waited her coming down.\nShe rounded to, backed her main topsail, and showed her decks\nfull of men, four guns on a side, hammock nettings, and everything\nman-of-war fashion, except that there was no boatswain’s whistle,\nand no uniforms on the quarter-deck.  A short, square-built man,\nin a rough grey jacket, with a speaking-trumpet in hand, stood in\nthe weather hammock nettings.  “Ship ahoy!\"–\"Hallo!\"– “What ship\nis that, pray?\"–\"Alert.\"–\"Where are you from, pray?” etc., etc.\nShe proved to be the brig Convoy, from the Sandwich Islands,\nengaged in otter hunting, among the islands which lie along\nthe coast.  Her armament was from her being an illegal trader.\nThe otter are very numerous among these islands, and being of\ngreat value, the government require a heavy sum for a license to\nhunt them, and lay a high duty upon every one shot or carried out\nof the country.  This vessel had no license, and paid no duty,\nbesides being engaged in smuggling goods on board other vessels\ntrading on the coast, and belonging to the same owners in Oahu.\nOur captain told him to look out for the Mexicans, but he said\nthey had not an armed vessel of his size in the whole Pacific.\nThis was without doubt the same vessel that showed herself off\nSanta Barbara a few months before.  These vessels frequently\nremain on the coast for years, without making port, except at\nthe islands for wood and water, and an occasional visit to Oahu\nfor a new outfit.",
        "Sunday, January 10th.  Arrived at Santa Barbara, and on the\nfollowing Wednesday, slipped our cable and went to sea, on account\nof a south-easter.  Returned to our anchorage the next day.  We were\nthe only vessel in the port.  The Pilgrim had passed through the\nCanal and hove-to off the town, nearly six weeks before, on her\npassage down from Monterey, and was now at the leeward.  She heard\nhere of our safe arrival at San Francisco.",
        "Great preparations were making on shore for the marriage of our\nagent, who was to marry Donna Anneta De G––- De N––- y C––-,\nyoungest daughter of Don Antonio N––-, the grandee of the place,\nand the head of the first family in California.  Our steward was\nashore three days, making pastry and cake, and some of the best\nof our stores were sent off with him.  On the day appointed for\nthe wedding, we took the captain ashore in the gig, and had orders\nto come for him at night, with leave to go up to the house and see\nthe fandango.  Returning on board, we found preparations making for\na salute.  Our guns were loaded and run out, men appointed to each,\ncartridges served out, matches lighted, and all the flags ready to\nbe run up.  I took my place at the starboard after gun, and we all\nwaited for the signal from on shore.  At ten o’clock the bride went up\nwith her sister to the confessional, dressed in deep black.  Nearly an\nhour intervened, when the great doors of the mission church opened,\nthe bells rang out a loud, discordant peal, the private signal for\nus was run up by the captain ashore, the bride, dressed in complete\nwhite, came out of the church with the bridegroom, followed by\na long procession.  Just as she stepped from the church door,\na small white cloud issued from the bows of our ship, which was\nfull in sight, the loud report echoed among the surrounding hills\nand over the bay, and instantly the ship was dressed in flags\nand pennants from stem to stern.  Twenty-three guns followed in\nregular succession, with an interval of fifteen seconds between\neach when the cloud cleared away, and the ship lay dressed in her\ncolors, all day.  At sun-down, another salute of the same number\nof guns was fired, and all the flags run down.  This we thought\nwas pretty well–a gun every fifteen seconds–for a merchantman\nwith only four guns and a dozen or twenty men.",
        "After supper, the gig’s crew were called, and we rowed ashore,\ndressed in our uniform, beached the boat, and went up to the\nfandango.  The bride’s father’s house was the principal one in the\nplace, with a large court in front, upon which a tent was built,\ncapable of containing several hundred people.  As we drew near,\nwe heard the accustomed sound of violins and guitars, and saw\na great motion of the people within.  Going in, we found nearly\nall the people of the town–men, women, and children–collected\nand crowded together, leaving barely room for the dancers; for on\nthese occasions no invitations are given, but every one is expected\nto come, though there is always a private entertainment within the\nhouse for particular friends.  The old women sat down in rows,\nclapping their hands to the music, and applauding the young ones.\nThe music was lively, and among the tunes, we recognized several\nof our popular airs, which we, without doubt, have taken from\nthe Spanish.  In the dancing, I was much disappointed.  The women\nstood upright, with their hands down by their sides, their eyes\nfixed upon the ground before them, and slided about without any\nperceptible means of motion; for their feet were invisible, the hem\nof their dresses forming a perfect circle about them, reaching to the\nground.  They looked as grave as though they were going through some\nreligious ceremony, their faces as little excited as their limbs;\nand on the whole, instead of the spirited, fascinating Spanish\ndances which I had expected, I found the Californian fandango,\non the part of the women at least, a lifeless affair.  The men\ndid better.  They danced with grace and spirit, moving in circles\nround their nearly stationary partners, and showing their figures\nto great advantage.",
        "A great deal was said about our friend Don Juan Bandini, and when he\ndid appear, which was toward the close of the evening, he certainly\ngave us the most graceful dancing that I had ever seen.  He was\ndressed in white pantaloons neatly made, a short jacket of dark\nsilk, gaily figured, white stockings and thin morocco slippers\nupon his very small feet.  His slight and graceful figure was\nwell calculated for dancing, and he moved about with the grace\nand daintiness of a young fawn.  An occasional touch of the\ntoe to the ground, seemed all that was necessary to give him a\nlong interval of motion in the air.  At the same time he was not\nfantastic or flourishing, but appeared to be rather repressing a\nstrong tendency to motion.  He was loudly applauded, and danced\nfrequently toward the close of the evening.  After the supper,\nthe waltzing began, which was confined to a very few of the “gente\nde razón,” and was considered a high accomplishment, and a mark of\naristocracy.  Here, too, Don Juan figured greatly, waltzing with the\nsister of the bride, (Donna Angustia, a handsome woman and a general\nfavorite,) in a variety of beautiful, but, to me, offensive figures,\nwhich lasted as much as half an hour, no one else taking the floor.\nThey were repeatedly and loudly applauded, the old men and women\njumping out of their seats in admiration, and the young people\nwaving their hats and handkerchiefs.  Indeed among people of the\ncharacter of these Mexicans, the waltz seemed to me to have found\nits right place.  The great amusement of the evening,–which\nI suppose was owing to its being carnival–was the breaking of\neggs filled with cologne, or other essences, upon the heads of\nthe company.  One end of the egg is broken and the inside taken\nout, then it is partly filled with cologne, and the whole sealed\nup.  The women bring a great number of these secretly about them,\nand the amusement is to break one upon the head of a gentleman\nwhen his back is turned.  He is bound in gallantry to find out\nthe lady and return the compliment, though it must not be done\nif the person sees you. A tall, stately Don, with immense grey\nwhiskers, and a look of great importance, was standing before me,\nwhen I felt a light hand on my shoulder, and turning round, saw Donna\nAngustia, (whom we all knew, as she had been up to Monterey, and down\nagain, in the Alert,) with her finger upon her lip, motioning me\ngently aside.  I stepped back a little, when she went up behind\nthe Don, and with one hand knocked off his huge sombrero, and at\nthe same instant, with the other, broke the egg upon his head,\nand springing behind me, was out of sight in a moment.  The Don\nturned slowly round, the cologne, running down his face, and over\nhis clothes, and a loud laugh breaking out from every quarter.\nHe looked round in vain, for some time, until the direction of\nso many laughing eyes showed him the fair offender.  She was his\nniece, and a great favorite with him, so old Don Domingo had to\njoin in the laugh.  A great many such tricks were played, and many\na war of sharp manoeuvering was carried on between couples of the\nyounger people, and at every successful exploit a general laugh\nwas raised.",
        "Another singular custom I was for some time at a loss about. \nA pretty young girl was dancing, named, after what would appear to\nus the sacrilegious custom of the country–Espiritu Santo, when a\nyoung man went behind her and placed his hat directly upon her\nhead, letting it fall down over her eyes, and sprang back among\nthe crowd.  She danced for some time with the hat on, when she\nthrew it off, which called forth a general shout; and the young\nman was obliged to go out upon the floor and pick it up.  Some of\nthe ladies, upon whose heads hats had been placed, threw them off\nat once, and a few kept them on throughout the dance, and took\nthem off at the end, and held them out in their hands, when the\nowner stepped out, bowed, and took it from them.  I soon began\nto suspect the meaning of the thing, and was afterward told that\nit was a compliment, and an offer to become the lady’s gallant\nfor the rest of the evening, and to wait upon her home.  If the\nhat was thrown off, the offer was refused, and the gentleman was\nobliged to pick up his hat amid a general laugh.  Much amusement\nwas caused sometimes by gentlemen putting hats on the ladies’ heads,\nwithout permitting them to see whom it was done by.  This obliged\nthem to throw them off, or keep them on at a venture, and when they\ncame to discover the owner, the laugh was often turned upon them. \nThe captain sent for us about ten o’clock, and we went aboard in\nhigh spirits, having enjoyed the new scene much, and were of great\nimportance among the crew, from having so much to tell, and from the\nprospect of going every night until it was over; for these fandangos\ngenerally last three days.  The next day, two of us were sent up to\nthe town, and took care to come back by way of Capitan Noriego’s\nand take a look into the booth.  The musicians were still there,\nupon their platform, scraping and twanging away, and a few people,\napparently of the lower classes, were dancing.  The dancing is kept\nup, at intervals, throughout the day, but the crowd, the spirit,\nand the élite, come in at night.  The next night, which was the last,\nwe went ashore in the same manner, until we got almost tired of the\nmonotonous twang of the instruments, the drawling sounds which the\nwomen kept up, as an accompaniment, and the slapping of the hands\nin time with the music, in place of castanets.  We found ourselves\nas great objects of attention as any persons or anything at the\nplace.  Our sailor dresses–and we took great pains to have them\nneat and shipshape–were much admired, and we were invited, from\nevery quarter, to give them an American sailor’s dance; but after\nthe ridiculous figure some of our countrymen cut, in dancing after\nthe Spaniards, we thought it best to leave it to their imaginations.\nOur agent, with a tight, black, swallow-tailed coat, just imported\nfrom Boston, a high stiff cravat, looking as if he had been pinned\nand skewered, with only his feet and hands left free, took the\nfloor just after Bandini; and we thought they had had enough of\nYankee grace.",
        "The last night they kept it up in great style, and were getting\ninto a high-go, when the captain called us off to go aboard,\nfor, it being south-easter season, he was afraid to remain on\nshore long; and it was well he did not, for that very night,\nwe slipped our cables, as a crowner to our fun ashore, and stood\noff before a south-easter, which lasted twelve hours, and returned\nto our anchorage the next day. ",
        "Monday, Feb. 1st.  After having been in port twenty-one days,\nwe sailed for San Pedro, where we arrived on the following day,\nhaving gone “all fluking,” with the weather clew of the mainsail\nhauled up, the yards braced in a little, and the lower studding-sails\njust drawing; the wind hardly shifting a point during the passage. \nHere we found the Ayacucho and the Pilgrim, which last we had not\nseen since the 11th of September,–nearly five months; and I really\nfelt something like an affection for the old brig which had been my\nfirst home, and in which I had spent nearly a year, and got the\nfirst rough and tumble of a sea life.  She, too, was associated,\nin my mind with Boston, the wharf from which we sailed, anchorage\nin the stream, leave-taking, and all such matters, which were now\nto me like small links connecting me with another world, which I\nhad once been in, and which, please God, I might yet see again. \nI went on board the first night, after supper; found the old\ncook in the galley, playing upon the fife which I had given him,\nas a parting present; had a hearty shake of the hand from him;\nand dove down into the forecastle, where were my old ship-mates,\nthe same as ever, glad to see me; for they had nearly given us up\nas lost, especially when they did not find us in Santa Barbara. \nThey had been at San Diego last, had been lying at San Pedro\nnearly a month, and had received three thousand hides from the\npueblo.  These were taken from her the next day, which filled\nus up, and we both got under weigh on the 4th, she bound up to\nSan Francisco again, and we to San Diego, where we arrived on\nthe 6th. ",
        "We were always glad to see San Diego; it being the depot, and a\nsnug little place, and seeming quite like home, especially to\nme, who had spent a summer there.  There was no vessel in port,\nthe Rosa having sailed for Valparaiso and Cadiz, and the Catalina\nfor Callao, nearly a month before.  We discharged our hides, and in\nfour days were ready to sail again for the windward; and, to our\ngreat joy–for the last time!  Over thirty thousand hides had\nbeen already collected, cured, and stowed away in the house,\nwhich, together with what we should collect, and the Pilgrim\nwould bring down from San Francisco, would make out her cargo. \nThe thought that we were actually going up for the last time,\nand that the next time we went round San Diego point it would\nbe “homeward bound,” brought things so near a close, that we\nfelt as though we were just there, though it must still be the\ngreater part of a year before we could see Boston. ",
        "I spent one evening, as had been my custom, at the oven with the\nSandwich Islanders; but it was far from being the usual noisy,\nlaughing time.  It has been said, that the greatest curse to each\nof the South Sea islands, was the first man who discovered it;\nand every one who knows anything of the history of our commerce\nin those parts, knows how much truth there is in this; and that\nthe white men, with their vices, have brought in diseases before\nunknown to the islanders, and which are now sweeping off the native\npopulation of the Sandwich Islands, at the rate of one fortieth of\nthe entire population annually.  They seem to be a doomed people. \nThe curse of a people calling themselves Christian, seems to follow\nthem everywhere; and even here, in this obscure place, lay two\nyoung islanders, whom I had left strong, active young men, in the\nvigor of health, wasting away under a disease, which they would\nnever have known but for their intercourse with Christianized Mexico\nand people from Christian America.  One of them was not so ill; and\nwas moving about, smoking his pipe, and talking, and trying to keep\nup his spirits; but the other, who was my friend, and Aikane–Hope,\nwas the most dreadful object I had ever seen in my life: his eyes\nsunken and dead, his cheeks fallen in against his teeth, his hands\nlooking like claws; a dreadful cough, which seemed to rack his whole\nshattered system, a hollow whispering voice, and an entire inability\nto move himself.  There he lay, upon a mat, on the ground, which was\nthe only floor of the oven, with no medicine, no comforts, and no\none to care for, or help him, but a few Kanakas, who were willing\nenough, but could do nothing.  The sight of him made me sick,\nand faint.  Poor fellow!  During the four months that I lived\nupon the beach, we were continually together, both in work, and\nin our excursions in the woods, and upon the water.  I really\nfelt a strong affection for him, and preferred him to any of my\nown countrymen there; and I believe there was nothing which he\nwould not have done for me.  When I came into the oven he looked\nat me, held out his hand, and said, in a low voice, but with a\ndelightful smile, “Aloha, Aikane!  Aloha nui!”  I comforted him\nas well as I could, and promised to ask the captain to help him\nfrom the medicine-chest, and told him I had no doubt the captain\nwould do what he could for him, as he had worked in our employ for\nseveral years, both on shore and aboard our vessels on the coast.\nI went aboard and turned into my hammock, but I could not sleep.",
        "Thinking, from my education, that I must have some knowledge of\nmedicine, the Kanakas had insisted upon my examining him carefully;\nand it was not a sight to be forgotten.  One of our crew, an old\nman-of-war’s man, of twenty years’ standing, who had seen sin\nand suffering in every shape, and whom I afterwards took to\nsee Hope, said it was dreadfully worse than anything he had\never seen, or even dreamed of.  He was horror-struck, as his\ncountenance showed; yet he had been among the worst cases in\nour naval hospitals.  I could not get the thought of the poor\nfellow out of my head all night; his horrible suffering, and his\napparently inevitable, horrible end. ",
        "The next day I told the captain of Hope’s state, and asked him\nif he would be so kind as to go and see him. ",
        "“What? a d––d Kanaka?” ",
        "“Yes, sir,” said I; “but he has worked four years for our vessels,\nand has been in the employ of our owners, both on shore and aboard.” ",
        "“Oh! he be d––d!” said the captain, and walked off. ",
        "This same man died afterwards of a fever on the deadly coast of\nSumatra; and God grant he had better care taken of him in his\nsufferings, than he ever gave to any one else!  Finding nothing\nwas to be got from the captain, I consulted an old shipmate, who\nhad much experience in these matters, and got from him a recipe,\nwhich he always kept by him.  With this I went to the mate, and told\nhim the case.  Mr. Brown had been entrusted with the general care of\nthe medicine-chest, and although a driving fellow, and a taught hand\nin a watch, he had good feelings, and was always inclined to be kind\nto the sick.  He said that Hope was not strictly one of the crew,\nbut as he was in our employ when taken sick, he should have the\nmedicines; and he got them and gave them to me, with leave to go\nashore at night.  Nothing could exceed the delight of the Kanakas,\nwhen I came bringing the medicines.  All their terms of affection\nand gratitude were spent upon me, and in a sense wasted, (for I\ncould not understand half of them,) yet they made all known by\ntheir manner.  Poor Hope was so much revived at the bare thought\nof anything’s being done for him, that he was already stronger\nand better.  I knew he must die as he was, and he could but die\nunder the medicines, and any chance was worth running.  An oven,\nexposed to every wind and change of weather, is no place to take\ncalomel; but nothing else would do, and strong remedies must be\nused, or he was gone.  The applications, internal and external,\nwere powerful, and I gave him strict directions to keep warm\nand sheltered, telling him it was his only chance for life.\nTwice, after this, I visited him, having only time to run up,\nwhile waiting in the boat.  He promised to take his medicines\nregularly until we returned, and insisted upon it that he was\ndoing better.",
        "We got under weigh on the 10th, bound up to San Pedro, and had\nthree days of calm and head winds, making but little progress.\nOn the fourth, we took a stiff south-easter, which obliged us\nto reef our topsails.  While on the yard, we saw a sail on the\nweather bow, and in about half an hour, passed the Ayacucho,\nunder double-reefed topsails, beating down to San Diego.\nArrived at San Pedro on the fourth day, and came-to in the old\nplace, a league from shore, with no other vessel in port, and the\nprospect of three weeks, or more, of dull life, rolling goods up\na slippery hill, carrying hides on our heads over sharp stones,\nand, perhaps, slipping for a south-easter.",
        "There was but one man in the only house here, and him I shall\nalways remember as a good specimen of a California ranger.\nHe had been a tailor in Philadelphia, and getting intemperate\nand in debt, he joined a trapping party and went to the Columbia\nriver, and thence down to Monterey, where he spent everything,\nleft his party, and came to the Pueblo de los Angelos, to work\nat his trade.  Here he went dead to leeward among the pulperias,\ngambling rooms, etc., and came down to San Pedro, to be moral by\nbeing out of temptation.  He had been in the house several weeks,\nworking hard at his trade, upon orders which he had brought with him,\nand talked much of his resolution, and opened his heart to us about\nhis past life.  After we had been here some time, he started off\none morning, in fine spirits, well dressed, to carry the clothes\nwhich he had been making to the pueblo, and saying he would bring\nback his money and some fresh orders the next day.  The next day\ncame, and a week passed, and nearly a fortnight, when, one day,\ngoing ashore, we saw a tall man, who looked like our friend the\ntailor, getting out of the back of an Indian’s cart, which had\njust come down from the pueblo. He stood for the house, but we bore\nup after him; when finding that we were overhauling him, he hove-to\nand spoke us.  Such a sight I never saw before.  Barefooted, with an\nold pair of trowsers tied round his waist by a piece of green hide,\na soiled cotton shirt, and a torn Indian hat; “cleaned out,” to the\nlast reál, and completely “used up.”  He confessed the whole matter;\nacknowledged that he was on his back; and now he had a prospect of a\nfit of the horrors for a week, and of being worse than useless for\nmonths.  This is a specimen of the life of half of the Americans\nand English who are adrift over the whole of California.  One of\nthe same stamp was Russell, who was master of the hide-house\nat San Diego, while I was there, and afterwards turned away\nfor his misconduct.  He spent his own money and nearly all\nthe stores among the half-bloods upon the beach, and being\nturned away, went up to the Presidio, where he lived the life\nof a desperate “loafer,” until some rascally deed sent him off\n\"between two days,” with men on horseback, dogs, and Indians in\nfull cry after him, among the hills.  One night, he burst into our\nroom at the hide-house, breathless, pale as a ghost, covered with\nmud, and torn by thorns and briers, nearly naked, and begged for\na crust of bread, saying he had neither eaten nor slept for three\ndays.  Here was the great Mr. Russell, who a month before was “Don\nTomàs,” “Capitán de la playa,” “Maéstro de la casa,” etc., etc.,\nbegging food and shelter of Kanakas and sailors.  He staid with\nus till he gave himself up, and was dragged off to the calabozo.",
        "Another, and a more amusing specimen, was one whom we saw at San\nFrancisco.  He had been a lad on board the ship California, in one\nof her first voyages, and ran away and commenced Ranchéro, gambling,\nstealing horses, etc. He worked along up to San Francisco, and was\nliving on a rancho near there, while we were in port.  One morning,\nwhen we went ashore in the boat, we found him at the landing-place,\ndressed in California style,–a wide hat, faded velveteen trowsers,\nand a blanket cloak thrown over his shoulders–and wishing to go off\nin the boat, saying he was going to paseár with our captain a little.\nWe had many doubts of the reception he would meet with; but he\nseemed to think himself company for any one.  We took him aboard,\nlanded him at the gangway, and went about our work, keeping an eye\nupon the quarter-deck, where the captain was walking.  The lad\nwent up to him with the most complete assurance, and raising his\nhat, wished him a good afternoon.  Captain T––- turned round,\nlooked at him from head to foot, and saying coolly, “Hallo! who\nthe h–- are you?” kept on his walk.  This was a rebuff not to\nbe mistaken, and the joke passed about among the crew by winks\nand signs, at different parts of the ship.  Finding himself\ndisappointed at headquarters, he edged along forward to the mate,\nwho was overseeing some work on the forecastle, and tried to begin\na yarn; but it would not do. The mate had seen the reception he\nhad met with aft, and would have no cast-off company.  The second\nmate was aloft, and the third mate and myself were painting the\nquarter-boat, which hung by the davits, so he betook himself to\nus; but we looked at one another, and the officer was too busy\nto say a word.  From us, he went to one and another of the crew,\nbut the joke had got before him, and he found everybody busy and\nsilent.  Looking over the rail a few moments afterward, we saw him\nat the galley-door talking to the cook.  This was a great comedown,\nfrom the highest seat in the synagogue to a seat in the galley with\nthe black cook.  At night, too, when supper was called, he stood in\nthe waist for some time, hoping to be asked down with the officers,\nbut they went below, one after another, and left him.  His next\nchance was with the carpenter and sail-maker, and he lounged round\nthe after hatchway until the last had gone down.  We had now had\nfun enough out of him, and taking pity on him, offered him a pot\nof tea, and a cut at the kid, with the rest, in the forecastle.\nHe was hungry, and it was growing dark, and he began to see that\nthere was no use in playing the caballero any longer, and came\ndown into the forecastle, put into the “grub” in sailor’s style,\nthrew off all his airs, and enjoyed the joke as much as any one;\nfor a man must take a joke among sailors.  He gave us the whole\naccount of his adventures in the country,–roguery and all–and\nwas very entertaining.  He was a smart, unprincipled fellow, was at\nthe bottom of most of the rascally doings of the country, and gave\nus a great deal of interesting information in the ways of the world\nwe were in.",
        "Saturday, Feb. 13th.  Were called up at midnight to slip for\na violent north-easter, for this rascally hole of San Pedro is\nunsafe in every wind but a south-wester, which is seldom known\nto blow more than once in a half century.  We went off with a\nflowing sheet, and hove-to under the lee of Catalina island,\nwhere we lay three days, and then returned to our anchorage. ",
        "Tuesday, Feb. 23d.  This afternoon, a signal was made from the\nshore, and we went off in the gig, and found the agent’s clerk,\nwho had been up to the pueblo, waiting at the landing-place, with a\npackage under his arm, covered with brown papers and tied carefully\nwith twine.  No sooner had we shoved off than he told us there was\ngood news from Santa Barbara.  “What’s that?” said one of the crew;\n\"has the bloody agent slipped off the hooks?  Has the old bundle of\nbones got him at last?\"–\"No; better than that.  The California\nhas arrived.”  Letters, papers, news, and, perhaps,–friends, on\nboard!  Our hearts were all up in our mouths, and we pulled away\nlike good fellows; for the precious packet could not be opened\nexcept by the captain.  As we pulled under the stern, the clerk\nheld up the package, and called out to the mate, who was leaning\nover the taffrail, that the California had arrived. ",
        "“Hurrah!” said the mate, so as to be heard fore and aft;\n\"California come, and news from Boston!” ",
        "Instantly there was a confusion on board which no one could account\nfor who has not been in the same situation.  All discipline seemed\nfor a moment relaxed. ",
        "“What’s that, Mr. Brown?” said the cook, putting his head out of\nthe galley–\"California come?” ",
        "“Aye, aye! you angel of darkness, and there’s a letter for you\nfrom Bullknop ’treet, number two-two-five–green door and brass\nknocker!” ",
        "The packet was sent down into the cabin, and every one waited\nto hear of the result.  As nothing came up, the officers began\nto feel that they were acting rather a child’s part, and turned\nthe crew to again and the same strict discipline was restored,\nwhich prohibits speech between man and man, while at work on\ndeck; so that, when the steward came forward with letters for\nthe crew, each man took his letters, carried them below to his\nchest, and came up again immediately; and not a letter was read\nuntil we had cleared up decks for the night. ",
        "An overstrained sense of manliness is the characteristic of\nseafaring men, or, rather, of life on board ship.  This often\ngives an appearance of want of feeling, and even of cruelty.\nFrom this, if a man comes within an ace of breaking his neck\nand escapes, it is made a joke of; and no notice must be taken\nof a bruise or cut; and any expression of pity, or any show of\nattention, would look sisterly, and unbecoming a man who has to\nface the rough and tumble of such a life.  From this, too, the sick\nare neglected at sea, and whatever sailors may be ashore, a sick\nman finds little sympathy or attention, forward or aft. A man, too,\ncan have nothing peculiar or sacred on board ship; for all the nicer\nfeelings they take pride in disregarding, both in themselves and\nothers.  A thin-skinned man could not live an hour on ship-board.\nOne would be torn raw unless he had the hide of an ox. A moment of\nnatural feeling for home and friends, and then the frigid routine\nof sea-life returned.  Jokes were made upon those who showed any\ninterest in the expected news, and everything near and dear was\nmade common stock for rude jokes and unfeeling coarseness, to which\nno exception could be taken by any one.",
        "Supper, too, must be eaten before the letters were read; and when,\nat last, they were brought out, they all got round any one who had\na letter, and expected to have it read aloud, and have it all in\ncommon.  If any one went by himself to read, it was–\"Fair play,\nthere; and no skulking!”  I took mine and went into the sailmaker’s\nberth, where I could read it without interruption.  It was dated\nAugust, just a year from the time I had sailed from home; and every\none was well, and no great change had taken place.  Thus, for one\nyear, my mind was set at ease, yet it was already six months from\nthe date of the letter, and what another year would bring to pass,\nwho could tell?  Every one away from home thinks that some great\nthing must have happened, while to those at home there seems to\nbe a continued monotony and lack of incident. ",
        "As much as my feelings were taken up by my own intelligence\nfrom home, I could not but be amused by a scene in the steerage. \nThe carpenter had been married just before leaving Boston, and\nduring the voyage had talked much about his wife, and had to bear\nand forbear, as every man, known to be married, must, aboard ship;\nyet the certainty of hearing from his wife by the first ship, seemed\nto keep up his spirits.  The California came, the packet was brought\non board; no one was in higher spirits than he; but when the letters\ncame forward, there was none for him.  The captain looked again,\nbut there was no mistake.  Poor “Chips,” could eat no supper. \nHe was completely down in the mouth.  “Sails” (the sailmaker)\ntried to comfort him, and told him he was a bloody fool to give\nup his grub for any woman’s daughter, and reminded him that he\nhad told him a dozen times that he’d never see or hear from his\nwife again. ",
        "“Ah!” said “Chips,” “you don’t know what it is to have a wife, and\"–",
        "“Don’t I?” said Sails; and then came, for the hundredth time, the story\nof his coming ashore at New York, from the Constellation frigate,\nafter a cruise of four years round the Horn,–being paid off with\nover five hundred dollars,–marrying, and taking a couple of rooms\nin a four-story house,–furnishing the rooms, (with a particular\naccount of the furniture, including a dozen flag-bottomed chairs,\nwhich he always dilated upon, whenever the subject of furniture was\nalluded to,)–going off to sea again, leaving his wife half-pay,\nlike a fool,–coming home and finding her “off, like Bob’s horse,\nwith nobody to pay the reckoning;” furniture gone,–flag-bottomed\nchairs and all;–and with it, his “long togs,” the half-pay,\nhis beaver hat, white linen shirts, and everything else.  His wife\nhe never saw, or heard of, from that day to this, and never wished\nto.  Then followed a sweeping assertion, not much to the credit of\nthe sex, if true, though he has Pope to back him.  “Come, Chips,\ncheer up like a man, and take some hot grub!  Don’t be made a fool\nof by anything in petticoats!  As for your wife, you’ll never see\nher again; she was ’up keeleg and off’ before you were outside of\nCape Cod.  You hove your money away like a fool; but every man\nmust learn once, just as I did; so you’d better square the yards\nwith her, and make the best of it.” ",
        "This was the best consolation “Sails” had to offer, but it did not\nseem to be just the thing the carpenter wanted; for, during several\ndays, he was very much dejected, and bore with difficulty the jokes\nof the sailors, and with still more difficulty their attempts at\nadvice and consolation, of most of which the sailmaker’s was a\ngood specimen. ",
        "Thursday, Feb. 25th.  Set sail for Santa Barbara, where we arrived\non Sunday, the 28th.  We just missed of seeing the California, for she\nhad sailed three days before, bound to Monterey, to enter her cargo and\nprocure her license, and thence to San Francisco, etc. Captain Arthur\nleft files of Boston papers for Captain T––-, which, after they had\nbeen read and talked over in the cabin, I procured from my friend\nthe third mate.  One file was of all the Boston Transcripts for\nthe month of August, 1835, and the rest were about a dozen Daily\nAdvertisers and Couriers, of different dates.  After all, there is\nnothing in a strange land like a newspaper from home.  Even a letter,\nin many respects, is nothing, in comparison with it.  It carries you\nback to the spot, better than anything else.  It is almost equal to\nclairvoyance.  The names of the streets, with the things advertised,\nare almost as good as seeing the signs; and while reading “Boy lost!” \none can almost hear the bell and well-known voice of “Old Wilson,\"\ncrying the boy as “strayed, stolen, or mislaid!”  Then there was\nthe Commencement at Cambridge, and the full account of the\nexercises at the graduating of my own class.  A list of all\nthose familiar names, (beginning as usual with Abbot, and ending\nwith W., ) which, as I read them over, one by one, brought up their\nfaces and characters as I had known them in the various scenes of\ncollege life.  Then I imagined them upon the stage, speaking their\norations, dissertations, colloquies, etc., with the gestures and\ntones of each, and tried to fancy the manner in which each would\nhandle his subject, *****, handsome, showy, and superficial; *****,\nwith his strong head, clear brain, cool self-possession; *****,\nmodest, sensitive, and underrated; *****, the mouth-piece of the\ndebating clubs, noisy, vaporous, and democratic; and so following. \nThen I could see them receiving their A. Bs. from the dignified,\nfeudal-looking President, with his “auctoritate mihi commissâ,\"\nand walking off the stage with their diplomas in their hands;\nwhile upon the very same day, their classmate was walking up\nand down California beach with a hide upon his head. ",
        "Every watch below, for a week, I pored over these papers, until I was\nsure there could be nothing in them that had escaped my attention,\nand was ashamed to keep them any longer. ",
        "Saturday, March 5th.  This was an important day in our almanac,\nfor it was on this day that we were first assured that our voyage\nwas really drawing to a close.  The captain gave orders to have\nthe ship ready for getting under weigh; and observed that there\nwas a good breeze to take us down to San Pedro.  Then we were not\ngoing up to windward.  Thus much was certain, and was soon known,\nfore and aft; and when we went in the gig to take him off, he shook\nhands with the people on the beach, and said that he never expected\nto see Santa Barbara again.  This settled the matter, and sent a\nthrill of pleasure through the heart of every one in the boat. \nWe pulled off with a will, saying to ourselves (I can speak for\nmyself at least)–\"Good-by, Santa Barbara!–This is the last pull\nhere–No more duckings in your breakers, and slipping from your\ncursed south-easters!”  The news was soon known aboard, and put\nlife into everything when we were getting under weigh.  Each one\nwas taking his last look at the mission, the town, the breakers\non the beach, and swearing that no money would make him ship to\nsee them again; and when all hands tallied on to the cat-fall,\nthe chorus of “Time for us to go!” was raised for the first time,\nand joined in, with full swing, by everybody.  One would have thought\nwe were on our voyage home, so near did it seem to us, though there\nwere yet three months for us on the coast. ",
        "We left here the young Englishman, George Marsh, of whom I have\nbefore spoken, who was wrecked upon the Pelew Islands.  He left us\nto take the berth of second mate on board the Ayacucho, which was\nlying in port.  He was well qualified for this, and his education\nwould enable him to rise to any situation on board ship.  I felt\nreally sorry to part from him.  There was something about him which\nexcited my curiosity; for I could not, for a moment, doubt that he\nwas well born, and, in early life, well bred.  There was the latent\ngentleman about him, and the sense of honor, and no little of the\npride, of a young man of good family.  The situation was offered\nhim only a few hours before we sailed; and though he must give up\nreturning to America, yet I have no doubt that the change from a\ndog’s berth to an officer’s, was too agreeable to his feelings to\nbe declined.  We pulled him on board the Ayacucho, and when he left\nthe boat he gave each of its crew a piece of money, except myself,\nand shook hands with me, nodding his head, as much as to say,–\"We\nunderstand one another,” and sprang on board.  Had I known, an hour\nsooner, that he was to leave us, I would have made an effort to get\nfrom him the true history of his early life.  He knew that I had\nno faith in the story which he told the crew, and perhaps, in the\nmoment of parting from me, probably forever, he would have given me\nthe true account.  Whether I shall ever meet him again, or whether\nhis manuscript narrative of his adventures in the Pelew Islands,\nwhich would be creditable to him and interesting to the world,\nwill ever see the light, I cannot tell.  His is one of those cases\nwhich are more numerous than those suppose, who have never lived\nanywhere but in their own homes, and never walked but in one line\nfrom their cradles to their graves.  We must come down from our\nheights, and leave our straight paths, for the byways and low\nplaces of life, if we would learn truths by strong contrasts;\nand in hovels, in forecastles, and among our own outcasts in\nforeign lands, see what has been wrought upon our fellow-creatures\nby accident, hardship, or vice.",
        "Two days brought us to San Pedro, and two days more (to our\nno small joy) gave us our last view of that place, which was\nuniversally called the hell of California, and seemed designed,\nin every way, for the wear and tear of sailors.  Not even the last\nview could bring out one feeling of regret.  No thanks, thought I,\nas we left the sandy shores in the distance, for the hours I have\nwalked over your stones, barefooted, with hides on my head;–for\nthe burdens I have carried up your steep, muddy hill;  for the\nduckings in your surf; and for the long days and longer nights\npassed on your desolate hill, watching piles of hides, hearing\nthe sharp bark of your eternal coati, and the dismal hooting of\nyour owls. ",
        "As I bade good-by to each successive place, I felt as though one\nlink after another were struck from the chain of my servitude.\nHaving kept close in shore, for the land-breeze, we passed the\nmission of San Juan Campestráno the same night, and saw distinctly,\nby the bright moonlight, the hill which I had gone down by a pair of\nhalyards in search of a few paltry hides.  “Forsan et haec olim,\"\nthought I, and took my last look of that place too.  And on the\nnext morning we were under the high point of San Diego.  The flood\ntide took us swiftly in, and we came-to, opposite our hide-house,\nand prepared to get everything in trim for a long stay.  This was\nour last port.  Here we were to discharge everything from the ship,\nclean her out, smoke her, take in our hides, wood, water, etc.,\nand set sail for Boston.  While all this was doing, we were to\nlie still in one place, and the port was a safe one, and there\nwas no fear of south-easters.  Accordingly, having picked out\na good berth, in the stream, with a good smooth beach opposite,\nfor a landing-place and within two cables’ length of our hide-house,\nwe moored ship, unbent all the sails, sent down the top-gallant\nyards and all the studding-sail booms, and housed the top-gallant\nmasts.  The boats were then hove out, and all the sails, spare spars,\nthe stores, the rigging not rove, and, in fact, everything which\nwas not in daily use, sent ashore, and stowed away in the house.\nThen went all our hides and horns, and we left hardly anything\nin the ship but her ballast, and this we made preparation to\nheave out, the next day.  At night, after we had knocked off,\nand were sitting round in the forecastle, smoking and talking\nand taking sailor’s pleasure, we congratulated ourselves upon\nbeing in that situation in which we had wished ourselves every\ntime we had come into San Diego.  “If we were only here for the\nlast time,” we had often said, “with our top-gallant masts housed\nand our sails unbent!\"–and now we had our wish.  Six weeks, or\ntwo months, of the hardest work we had yet seen, was before us,\nand then–\"Good-by to California!”",
        "We turned-in early, knowing that we might expect an early call;\nand sure enough, before the stars had quite faded, “All hands ahoy!\"\nand we were turned-to, heaving out ballast.  A regulation of the port\nforbids any ballast to be thrown overboard; accordingly, our long-boat\nwas lined inside with rough boards and brought alongside the gangway,\nbut where one tub-full went into the boat, twenty went overboard.\nThis is done by every vessel, for the ballast can make but little\ndifference in the channel, and it saves more than a week of labor,\nwhich would be spent in loading the boats, rowing them to the point,\nand unloading them.  When any people from the Presidio were on\nboard, the boat was hauled up and ballast thrown in; but when the\ncoast was clear, she was dropped astern again, and the ballast\nfell overboard. This is one of those petty frauds which every\nvessel practises in ports of inferior foreign nations, and which\nare lost sight of, among the countless deeds of greater weight\nwhich are hardly less common.  Fortunately a sailor, not being a\nfree agent in work aboard ship, is not accountable; yet the fact\nof being constantly employed, without thought, in such things,\nbegets an indifference to the rights of others.",
        "Friday, and a part of Saturday, we were engaged in this work,\nuntil we had thrown out all but what we wanted under our cargo\non the passage home; when, as the next day was Sunday, and a\ngood day for smoking ship, we cleared everything out of the\ncabin and forecastle, made a slow fire of charcoal, birch bark,\nbrimstone, and other matters, on the ballast in the bottom of\nthe hold, calked up the hatches and every open seam, and pasted\nover the cracks of the windows, and the slides of the scuttles,\nand companionway.  Wherever smoke was seen coming out, we calked\nand pasted, and, so far as we could, made the ship smoke tight. \nThe captain and officers slept under the awning which was spread\nover the quarter-deck; and we stowed ourselves away under an old\nstudding-sail, which we drew over one side of the forecastle. \nThe next day, from fear that something might happen, orders were\ngiven for no one to leave the ship, and, as the decks were lumbered\nup with everything, we could not wash them down, so we had nothing\nto do, all day long. Unfortunately, our books were where we could not\nget at them, and we were turning about for something to do, when one\nman recollected a book he had left in the galley.  He went after\nit, and it proved to be Woodstock.  This was a great windfall,\nand as all could not read it at once, I, being the scholar of\nthe company, was appointed reader.  I got a knot of six or eight\nabout me, and no one could have had a more attentive audience. \nSome laughed at the “scholars,” and went over the other side\nof the forecastle, to work, and spin their yarns; but I carried\nthe day, and had the cream of the crew for my hearers.  Many of\nthe reflections, and the political parts, I omitted, but all the\nnarrative they were delighted with; especially the descriptions\nof the Puritans, and the sermons and harangues of the Round-head\nsoldiers.  The gallantry of Charles, Dr. Radcliffe’s plots,\nthe knavery of “trusty Tompkins,\"–in fact, every part seemed to\nchain their attention.  Many things which, while I was reading,\nI had a misgiving about, thinking them above their capacity, I was\nsurprised to find them enter into completely. ",
        "I read nearly all day, until sundown; when, as soon as supper was\nover, as I had nearly finished, they got a light from the galley;\nand by skipping what was less interesting, I carried them through\nto the marriage of Everard, and the restoration of Charles the\nSecond, before eight o’clock. ",
        "The next morning, we took the battens from the hatches, and opened\nthe ship.  A few stifled rats were found; and what bugs, cockroaches,\nfleas, and other vermin, there might have been on board, must have\nunrove their life-lines before the hatches were opened.  The ship\nbeing now ready, we covered the bottom of the hold over, fore and\naft, with dried brush for dunnage, and having levelled everything\naway, we were ready to take in our cargo.  All the hides that had\nbeen collected since the California left the coast, (a little more\nthan two years,) amounting to about forty thousand, were cured,\ndried, and stowed away in the house, waiting for our good ship\nto take them to Boston. ",
        "Now began the operation of taking in our cargo, which kept us hard\nat work, from the grey of the morning till star-light, for six weeks,\nwith the exception of Sundays, and of just time to swallow our meals.\nTo carry the work on quicker, a division of labor was made.  Two men\nthrew the hides down from the piles in the house, two more picked\nthem up and put them on a long horizontal pole, raised a few feet\nfrom the ground, where they were beaten, by two more, with flails,\nsomewhat like those used in threshing wheat.  When beaten, they were\ntaken from this pole by two more, and placed upon a platform\nof boards; and ten or a dozen men, with their trowsers rolled\nup, were constantly going, back and forth, from the platform to\nthe boat, which was kept off where she would just float, with the\nhides upon their heads.  The throwing the hides upon the pole was\nthe most difficult work, and required a sleight of hand which was\nonly to be got by long practice.  As I was known for a hide-curer,\nthis post was assigned to me, and I continued at it for six or\neight days, tossing, in that time, from eight to ten thousand hides,\nuntil my wrists became so lame that I gave in; and was transferred\nto the gang that was employed in filling the boats, where I remained\nfor the rest of the time.  As we were obliged to carry the hides\non our heads from fear of their getting wet, we each had a piece\nof sheepskin sewed into the inside of our hats, with the wool next\nto our heads, and thus were able to bear the weight, day after day,\nwhich would otherwise have soon worn off our hair, and borne hard upon\nour skulls.  Upon the whole, ours was the best berth; for though the\nwater was nipping cold, early in the morning and late at night,\nand being so continually wet was rather an exposure, yet we got\nrid of the constant dust and dirt from the beating of the hides,\nand being all of us young and hearty, did not mind the exposure.\nThe older men of the crew, whom it would have been dangerous to\nhave kept in the water, remained on board with the mate, to stow\nthe hides away, as fast as they were brought off by the boats.",
        "We continued at work in this manner until the lower hold was filled\nto within four feet of the beams, when all hands were called aboard\nto commence steeving.  As this is a peculiar operation, it will\nrequire a minute description. ",
        "Before stowing the hides, as I have said, the ballast is levelled\noff, just above the keelson, and then loose dunnage placed upon it,\non which the hides rest.  The greatest care is used in stowing, to make\nthe ship hold as many hides as possible.  It is no mean art, and a man\nskilled in it is an important character in California.  Many a dispute\nhave I heard raging high between professed “beach-combers,” as to\nwhether the hides should be stowed “shingling,” or “back-to-back,\nand flipper-to-flipper;” upon which point there was an entire and\nbitter division of sentiment among the savans.  We adopted each\nmethod at different periods of the stowing, and parties ran high\nin the forecastle, some siding with “old Bill” in favor of the\nformer, and others scouting him, and relying upon “English Bob\"\nof the Ayacucho, who had been eight years in California, and was\nwilling to risk his life and limb for the latter method.  At length\na compromise was effected, and a middle course, of shifting the ends\nand backs at every lay, was adopted, which worked well, and which,\nthough they held it inferior to their own, each party granted was\nbetter than that of the other. ",
        "Having filled the ship up, in this way, to within four feet of\nher beams, the process of steeving commenced, by which an hundred\nhides are got into a place where one could not be forced by hand,\nand which presses the hides to the utmost, sometimes starting the\nbeams of the ship, resembling in its effects the jack-screws which\nare used in stowing cotton.  Each morning we went ashore, and beat\nand brought off as many hides as we could steeve in the course of\nthe day, and, after breakfast, went down into the hold, where we\nremained at work until night.  The whole length of the hold, from\nstem to stern, was floored off level, and we began with raising\na pile in the after part, hard against the bulkhead of the run,\nand filling it up to the beams, crowding in as many as we could\nby hand and pushing in with oars; when a large “book” was made\nof from twenty-five to fifty hides, doubled at the backs, and put\ninto one another, like the leaves of a book.  An opening was then\nmade between two hides in the pile, and the back of the outside\nhide of the book inserted.  Two long, heavy spars, called steeves,\nmade of the strongest wood, and sharpened off like a wedge at\none end, were placed with their wedge ends into the inside of\nthe hide which was the centre of the book, and to the other end\nof each, straps were fitted, into which large tackles were hooked,\ncomposed each of two huge purchase blocks, one hooked to the strap\non the end of the steeve, and the other into a dog, fastened into\none of the beams, as far aft as it could be got.  When this was\narranged, and the ways greased upon which the book was to slide,\nthe falls of the tackles were stretched forward, and all hands\ntallied on, and bowsed away until the book was well entered;\nwhen these tackles were nippered, straps and toggles clapped\nupon the falls, and two more luff tackles hooked on, with dogs,\nin the same manner; and thus, by luff upon luff, the power was\nmultiplied, until into a pile in which one hide more could not\nbe crowded by hand, an hundred or an hundred and fifty were often\ndriven in by this complication of purchases.  When the last luff\nwas hooked on, all hands were called to the rope–cook, steward,\nand all–and ranging ourselves at the falls, one behind the other,\nsitting down on the hides, with our heads just even with the beams,\nwe set taught upon the tackles, and striking up a song, and all\nlying back at the chorus, we bowsed the tackles home, and drove\nthe large books chock in out of sight.",
        "The sailor’s songs for capstans and falls are of a peculiar kind,\nhaving a chorus at the end of each line.  The burden is usually\nsung, by one alone, and, at the chorus, all hands join in,–and\nthe louder the noise, the better.  With us, the chorus seemed\nalmost to raise the decks of the ship, and might be heard at\na great distance, ashore.  A song is as necessary to sailors\nas the drum and fife to a soldier.  They can’t pull in time,\nor pull with a will, without it.  Many a time, when a thing\ngoes heavy, with one fellow yo-ho-ing, a lively song, like “Heave,\nto the girls!”  “Nancy oh!”  “Jack Cross-tree,” etc., has put life\nand strength into every arm. We often found a great difference in\nthe effect of the different songs in driving in the hides.  Two or\nthree songs would be tried, one after the other; with no effect;–not\nan inch could be got upon the tackles–when a new song, struck up,\nseemed to hit the humor of the moment, and drove the tackles “two\nblocks” at once. “Heave round hearty!”  “Captain gone ashore!” and\nthe like, might do for common pulls, but in an emergency, when we\nwanted a heavy, “raise-the-dead” pull, which should start the beams\nof the ship, there was nothing like “Time for us to go!”  “Round\nthe corner,” or “Hurrah! hurrah! my hearty bullies!”",
        "This was the most lively part of our work.  A little boating and\nbeach work in the morning; then twenty or thirty men down in a\nclose hold, where we were obliged to sit down and slide about,\npassing hides, and rowsing about the great steeves, tackles,\nand dogs, singing out at the falls, and seeing the ship filling up\nevery day.  The work was as hard as it could well be.  There was\nnot a moment’s cessation from Monday morning till Saturday night,\nwhen we were generally beaten out, and glad to have a full night’s\nrest, a wash and shift of clothes, and a quiet Sunday.  During all\nthis time,–which would have startled Dr. Graham–we lived upon\nalmost nothing but fresh beef; fried beefsteaks, three times a\nday,–morning, noon, and night.  At morning and night we had a\nquart of tea to each man; and an allowance of about a pound of\nhard bread a day; but our chief article of food was the beef.\nA mess, consisting of six men, had a large wooden kid piled up\nwith beefsteaks, cut thick, and fried in fat, with the grease\npoured over them.  Round this we sat, attacking it with our\njack-knives and teeth, and with the appetite of young lions,\nand sent back an empty kid to the galley.  This was done three\ntimes a day.  How many pounds each man ate in a day, I will not\nattempt to compute.  A whole bullock (we ate liver and all) lasted\nus but four days.  Such devouring of flesh, I will venture to say,\nwas seldom known before.  What one man ate in a day, over a hearty\nman’s allowance, would make a Russian’s heart leap into his mouth.\nIndeed, during all the time we were upon the coast, our principal\nfood was fresh beef, and every man had perfect health; but this\nwas a time of especial devouring; and what we should have done\nwithout meat, I cannot tell.  Once or twice, when our bullocks\nfailed and we were obliged to make a meal upon dry bread and\nwater, it seemed like feeding upon shavings.  Light and dry,\nfeeling unsatisfied, and, at the same time, full, we were glad\nto see four quarters of a bullock, just killed, swinging from\nthe fore-top.  Whatever theories may be started by sedentary\nmen, certainly no men could have gone through more hard work and\nexposure for sixteen months in more perfect health, and without\nailings and failings, than our ship’s crew, let them have lived\nupon Hygeia’s own baking and dressing.",
        "Friday, April 15th.  Arrived, brig Pilgrim, from the windward.\nIt was a sad sight for her crew to see us getting ready to go off\nthe coast, while they, who had been longer on the coast than the\nAlert, were condemned to another year’s hard service.  I spent an\nevening on board, and found them making the best of the matter,\nand determined to rough it out as they might; but my friend S––-\nwas determined to go home in the ship, if money or interest could\nbring it to pass.  After considerable negotiating and working,\nhe succeeded in persuading my English friend, Tom Harris,–my\ncompanion in the anchor watch–for thirty dollars, some clothes,\nand an intimation from Captain Faucon that he should want a second\nmate before the voyage was up, to take his place in the brig as\nsoon as she was ready to go up to windward. ",
        "The first opportunity I could get to speak to Captain Faucon,\nI asked him to step up to the oven and look at Hope, whom he\nknew well, having had him on board his vessel.  He went to\nsee him, but said that he had so little medicine, and expected\nto be so long on the coast, that he could do nothing for him,\nbut that Captain Arthur would take care of him when he came down\nin the California, which would be in a week or more.  I had been\nto see Hope the first night after we got into San Diego this last\ntime, and had frequently since spent the early part of a night in\nthe oven.  I hardly expected, when I left him to go to windward,\nto find him alive upon my return.  He was certainly as low as he\ncould well be when I left him, and what would be the effect of the\nmedicines that I gave him, I hardly then dared to conjecture. \nYet I knew that he must die without them.  I was not a little\nrejoiced, therefore, and relieved, upon our return, to see him\ndecidedly better.  The medicines were strong, and took hold and\ngave a check to the disorder which was destroying him; and, more\nthan that, they had begun the work of exterminating it.  I shall\nnever forget the gratitude that he expressed.  All the Kanakas\nattributed his escape solely to my knowledge, and would not be\npersuaded that I had not all the secrets of the physical system\nopen to me and under my control.  My medicines, however, were gone,\nand no more could be got from the ship, so that his life was left\nto hang upon the arrival of the California.",
        "Sunday, April 24th.  We had now been nearly seven weeks in San Diego,\nand had taken in the greater part of our cargo, and were looking out,\nevery day, for the arrival of the California, which had our agent\non board; when, this afternoon, some Kanakas, who had been over\nthe hill for rabbits and to fight rattlesnakes, came running down\nthe path, singing out, “Kail ho!” with all their might.  Mr. H.,\nour third mate, was ashore, and asking them particularly about\nthe size of the sail, etc., and learning that it was “Moku–Nui\nMoku,” hailed our ship, and said that the California was on the\nother side of the point.  Instantly, all hands were turned up,\nthe bow guns run out and loaded, the ensign and broad pennant set,\nthe yards squared by lifts and braces, and everything got ready to\nmake a good appearance.  The instant she showed her nose round\nthe point, we began our salute.  She came in under top-gallant\nsails, clewed up and furled her sails in good order, and came-to,\nwithin good swinging distance of us.  It being Sunday, and nothing\nto do, all hands were on the forecastle, criticising the new-comer. \nShe was a good, substantial ship, not quite so long as the Alert,\nand wall-sided and kettle-bottomed, after the latest fashion of\nsouth-shore cotton and sugar wagons; strong, too, and tight, and a\ngood average sailor, but with no pretensions to beauty, and nothing\nin the style of a “crack ship.”  Upon the whole, we were perfectly\nsatisfied that the Alert might hold up her head with a ship twice\nas smart as she. ",
        "At night, some of us got a boat and went on board, and found\na large, roomy forecastle, (for she was squarer forward than\nthe Alert,) and a crew of a dozen or fifteen men and boys,\nsitting around on their chests, smoking and talking, and ready\nto give a welcome to any of our ship’s company.  It was just\nseven months since they left Boston, which seemed but yesterday\nto us.  Accordingly, we had much to ask, for though we had seen\nthe newspapers that she brought, yet these were the very men who\nhad been in Boston and seen everything with their own eyes.  One of\nthe green-hands was a Boston boy, from one of the public schools,\nand, of course, knew many things which we wished to ask about, and\non inquiring the names of our two Boston boys, found that they had\nbeen schoolmates of his.  Our men had hundreds of questions to ask\nabout Ann street, the boarding-houses, the ships in port, the rate\nof wages, and other matters. ",
        "Among her crew were two English man-of-war’s-men, so that, of course,\nwe soon had music.  They sang in the true sailor’s style, and the\nrest of the crew, which was a remarkably musical one, joined in the\nchoruses.  They had many of the latest sailor songs, which had not\nyet got about among our merchantmen, and which they were very choice\nof.  They began soon after we came on board, and kept it up until\nafter two bells, when the second mate came forward and called “the\nAlerts away!”  Battle-songs, drinking-songs, boat-songs, love-songs,\nand everything else, they seemed to have a complete assortment of,\nand I was glad to find that “All in the Downs,” “Poor Tom Bowline,\"\n\"The Bay of Biscay,” “List, ye Landsmen!” and all those classical\nsongs of the sea, still held their places.  In addition to these,\nthey had picked up at the theatres and other places a few songs of\na little more genteel cast, which they were very proud of; and I\nshall never forget hearing an old salt, who had broken his voice\nby hard drinking on shore, and bellowing from the mast-head in a\nhundred northwesters, with all manner of ungovernable trills and\nquavers in the high notes, breaking into a rough falsetto–and in\nthe low ones, growling along like the dying away of the boatswain’s\n\"all hands ahoy!” down the hatch-way, singing, “Oh, no, we never\nmention him.” ",
        "“Perhaps, like me, he struggles with\nEach feeling of regret;\nBut if he’s loved as I have loved,\nHe never can forget!” ",
        "The last line, being the conclusion, he roared out at the top of\nhis voice, breaking each word up into half a dozen syllables. \nThis was very popular, and Jack was called upon every night to\ngive them his “sentimental song.”  No one called for it more\nloudly than I, for the complete absurdity of the execution,\nand the sailors’ perfect satisfaction in it, were ludicrous\nbeyond measure. ",
        "The next day, the California commenced unloading her cargo; and\nher boats’ crews, in coming and going, sang their boat-songs,\nkeeping time with their oars.  This they did all day long for\nseveral days, until their hides were all discharged, when a gang\nof them were sent on board the Alert, to help us steeve our hides. \nThis was a windfall for us, for they had a set of new songs for the\ncapstan and fall, and ours had got nearly worn out by six weeks’\nconstant use.  I have no doubt that this timely reinforcement of\nsongs hastened our work several days. ",
        "Our cargo was now nearly all taken in; and my old friend, the Pilgrim,\nhaving completed her discharge, unmoored, to set sail the next morning\non another long trip to windward.  I was just thinking of her hard\nlot, and congratulating myself upon my escape from her, when I\nreceived a summons into the cabin.  I went aft, and there found,\nseated round the cabin table, my own captain, Captain Faucon of\nthe Pilgrim, and Mr. R––-, the agent.  Captain T––- turned\nto me and asked abruptly–",
        "“D––-, do you want to go home in the ship?” ",
        "“Certainly, sir,” said I; “I expect to go home in the ship.” ",
        "“Then,” said he, “you must get some one to go in your place on\nboard the Pilgrim.” ",
        "I was so completely “taken aback” by this sudden intimation, that for\na moment I could make no reply.  I knew that it would be hopeless to\nattempt to prevail upon any of the ship’s crew to take twelve months\nmore upon the California in the brig.  I knew, too, that Captain\nT––- had received orders to bring me home in the Alert, and he\nhad told me, when I was at the hide-house, that I was to go home\nin her; and even if this had not been so, it was cruel to give me\nno notice of the step they were going to take, until a few hours\nbefore the brig would sail.  As soon as I had got my wits about me,\nI put on a bold front, and told him plainly that I had a letter in\nmy chest informing me that he had been written to, by the owners\nin Boston, to bring me home in the ship, and moreover, that he\nhad told me that I was to go in the ship. ",
        "To have this told him, and to be opposed in such a manner, was more\nthan my lord paramount had been used to. ",
        "He turned fiercely upon me, and tried to look me down, and face me\nout of my statement; but finding that that wouldn’t do, and that I\nwas entering upon my defence in such a way as would show to the other\ntwo that he was in the wrong,–he changed his ground, and pointed\nto the shipping papers of the Pilgrim, from which my name had never\nbeen erased, and said that there was my name,–that I belonged to\nher,–that he had an absolute discretionary power,–and, in short,\nthat I must be on board the Pilgrim by the next morning with my chest\nand hammock, or have some one ready to go in my place, and that he\nwould not hear another word from me.  No court or star chamber could\nproceed more summarily with a poor devil, than this trio was about\nto do with me; condemning me to a punishment worse than a Botany\nBay exile, and to a fate which would alter the whole current of\nmy future life; for two years more in California would have made\nme a sailor for the rest of my days.  I felt all this, and saw\nthe necessity of being determined.  I repeated what I had said,\nand insisted upon my right to return in the ship. ",
        "I “raised my arm, and tauld my crack,\nBefore them a’.” ",
        "But it would have all availed me nothing, had I been “some poor\nbody,” before this absolute, domineering tribunal.  But they saw\nthat I would not go, unless “vi et armis,” and they knew that I\nhad friends and interest enough at home to make them suffer for\nany injustice they might do me.  It was probably this that turned\nthe matter; for the captain changed his tone entirely, and asked\nme if, in case any one went in my place, I would give him the same\nsum that S––- gave Harris to exchange with him.  I told him that\nif any one was sent on board the brig, I should pity him, and be\nwilling to help him to that, or almost any amount; but would not\nspeak of it as an exchange. ",
        "“Very well,” said he.  “Go forward about your business, and send\nEnglish Ben here to me!” ",
        "I went forward with a light heart, but feeling as angry, and as\nmuch contempt as I could well contain between my teeth.  English Ben\nwas sent aft, and in a few moments came forward, looking as though\nhe had received his sentence to be hung.  The captain had told him\nto get his things ready to go on board the brig the next morning;\nand that I would give him thirty dollars and a suit of clothes. \nThe hands had “knocked off” for dinner, and were standing about the\nforecastle, when Ben came forward and told his story.  I could see\nplainly that it made a great excitement, and that, unless I explained\nthe matter to them, the feeling would be turned against me.  Ben was a\npoor English boy, a stranger in Boston, and without friends or money;\nand being an active, willing lad, and a good sailor for his years,\nwas a general favorite.  “Oh, yes!” said the crew, “the captain\nhas let you off, because you are a gentleman’s son, and have got\nfriends, and know the owners; and taken Ben, because he is poor,\nand has got nobody to say a word for him!”  I knew that this was too\ntrue to be answered, but I excused myself from any blame, and told\nthem that I had a right to go home, at all events.  This pacified\nthem a little, but Jack had got a notion that a poor lad was to be\nimposed upon, and did not distinguish very clearly; and though I\nknew that I was in no fault, and, in fact, had barely escaped the\ngrossest injustice, yet I felt that my berth was getting to be a\ndisagreeable one.  The notion that I was not “one of them,” which,\nby a participation in all their labor and hardships, and having no\nfavor shown me, had been laid asleep, was beginning to revive.\nBut far stronger than any feeling for myself, was the pity I felt\nfor the poor lad.  He had depended upon going home in the ship;\nand from Boston, was going immediately to Liverpool, to see his\nfriends.  Beside this, having begun the voyage with very few clothes,\nhe had taken up the greater part of his wages in the slop-chest,\nand it was every day a losing concern to him; and, like all the\nrest of the crew, he had a hearty hatred of California, and the\nprospect of eighteen months or two years more of hide-droghing\nseemed completely to break down his spirit.  I had determined\nnot to go myself, happen what would, and I knew that the captain\nwould not dare to attempt to force me. I knew, too, that the two\ncaptains had agreed together to get some one, and that unless I\ncould prevail upon somebody to go voluntarily, there would be no\nhelp for Ben.  From this consideration, though I had said that I\nwould have nothing to do with an exchange, I did my best to get\nsome one to go voluntarily.  I offered to give an order upon the\nowners in Boston for six months’ wages, and also all the clothes,\nbooks, and other matters, which I should not want upon the voyage\nhome.  When this offer was published in the ship, and the case of\npoor Ben was set forth in strong colors, several, who would not\nhave dreamed of going themselves, were busy in talking it up to\nothers, who, they thought, might be tempted to accept it; and,\nat length, one fellow, a harum-scarum lad, whom we called Harry\nBluff, and who did not care what country or ship he was in, if he\nhad clothes enough and money enough–partly from pity for Ben,\nand partly from the thought he should have “cruising money” for\nthe rest of his stay,–came forward, and offered to go and “sling\nhis hammock in the bloody hooker.”  Lest his purpose should cool,\nI signed an order for the sum upon the owners in Boston, gave him\nall the clothes I could spare, and sent him aft to the captain,\nto let him know what had been done.  The skipper accepted the\nexchange, and was, doubtless, glad to have it pass off so easily.\nAt the same time he cashed the order, which was endorsed to him,(1)",
        "–––––––-\n1. When the crew were paid off in Boston, the owners answered\nthe order, but generously refused to deduct the amount from the\npay-roll, saying that the exchange was made under compulsion. \nThey also allowed S––- his exchange money. \n–––––––-",
        "and the next morning, the lad went aboard the brig, apparently in\ngood spirits, having shaken hands with each of us and wished us a\npleasant passage home, jingling the money in his pockets, and calling\nout, “Never say die, while there’s a shot in the locker.”  The same\nboat carried off Harris, my old watchmate, who had previously made\nan exchange with my friend S––-.",
        "I was sorry to part with Harris.  Nearly two hundred hours (as we\nhad calculated it) had we walked the ship’s deck together, at anchor\nwatch, when all hands were below, and talked over and over every\nsubject which came within the ken of either of us.  He gave me a\nstrong gripe with his hand; and I told him, if he came to Boston\nagain, not to fail to find me out, and let me see an old watchmate. \nThe same boat brought on board S––-, my friend, who had begun\nthe voyage with me from Boston, and, like me, was going back to\nhis family and to the society which we had been born and brought\nup in.  We congratulated one another upon finding what we had\nlong talked over and wished for, thus brought about; and none on\nboard the ship were more glad than ourselves to see the old brig\nstanding round the point, under full sail.  As she passed abreast\nof us, we all collected in the waist, and gave her three loud,\nhearty cheers, waving our hats in the air.  Her crew sprang\ninto the rigging and chains, answered us with three as loud,\nto which we, after the nautical custom, gave one in return. \nI took my last look of their familiar faces as they got over the\nrail, and saw the old black cook put his head out of the galley,\nand wave his cap over his head.  The crew flew aloft to loose the\ntop-gallant sails and royals; the two captains waved their hands\nto one another; and, in ten minutes, we saw the last inch of her\nwhite canvas, as she rounded the point. ",
        "Relieved as I was to see her well off, (and I felt like one who had\njust sprung from an iron trap which was closing upon him) I had yet a\nfeeling of regret at taking the last look at the old craft in which I\nhad spent a year, and the first year, of my sailor’s life–which had\nbeen my first home in the new world into which I had entered–and\nwith which I had associated so many things,–my first leaving home,\nmy first crossing the equator, Cape Horn, Juan Fernandez, death at\nsea, and other things, serious and common.  Yet, with all this,\nand the feeling I had for my old shipmates, condemned to another\nterm of California life, the thought that we were done with it,\nand that one week more would see us on our way to Boston, was a\ncure for everything.",
        "Friday, May 6th, completed the taking of our cargo, and was a\nmemorable day in our calendar.  The time when we were to take\nin our last hide, we had looked forward to, for sixteen months,\nas the first bright spot.  When the last hide was stowed away,\nand the hatches calked down, the tarpaulins battened on to them,\nthe long-boat hoisted in and secured, and the decks swept down for\nthe night,–the chief mate sprang upon the top of the long-boat,\ncalled all hands into the waist, and giving us a signal by swinging\nhis cap over his head,–we gave three long, loud cheers, which came\nfrom the bottom of our hearts, and made the hills and valleys\nring again.  In a moment, we heard three, in answer, from the\nCalifornia’s crew, who had seen us taking in our long-boat,\nand–\"the cry they heard–its meaning knew.”",
        "The last week, we had been occupied in taking in a supply of\nwood and water for the passage home, and bringing on board the\nspare spars, sails, etc.  I was sent off with a party of Indians\nto fill the water-casks, at a spring, about three miles from the\nshipping, and near the town, and was absent three days, living at the\ntown, and spending the daytime in filling the casks and transporting\nthem on ox-carts to the landing-place, whence they were taken on\nboard by the crew with boats.  This being all done with, we gave\none day to bending our sails; and at night, every sail, from the\ncourses to the skysails, was bent, and every studding-sail ready\nfor setting.",
        "Before our sailing, an unsuccessful attempt was made by one of\nthe crew of the California to effect an exchange with one of our\nnumber.  It was a lad, between fifteen and sixteen years of age,\nwho went by the name of the “reefer,” having been a midshipman in\nan East India Company’s ship.  His singular character and story\nhad excited our interest ever since the ship came into the port.\nHe was a delicate, slender little fellow, with a beautiful pearly\ncomplexion, regular features, forehead as white as marble, black\nhaired, curling beautifully, rounded, tapering, delicate fingers,\nsmall feet, soft voice, gentle manners, and, in fact, every sign\nof having been well born and bred.  At the same time there was\nsomething in his expression which showed a slight deficiency of\nintellect.  How great the deficiency was, or what it resulted from;\nwhether he was born so; whether it was the result of disease or\naccident; or whether, as some said, it was brought on by his\ndistress of mind, during the voyage, I cannot say.  From his own\naccount of himself, and from many circumstances which were known\nin connection with his story, he must have been the son of a man\nof wealth.  His mother was an Italian woman.  He was probably a\nnatural son, for in scarcely any other way could the incidents\nof his early life be accounted for.  He said that his parents did\nnot live together, and he seemed to have been ill treated by his\nfather.  Though he had been delicately brought up, and indulged\nin every way, (and he had then with him trinkets which had been\ngiven him at home,) yet his education had been sadly neglected;\nand when only twelve years old, he was sent as midshipman in the\nCompany’s service.  His own story was, that he afterwards ran\naway from home, upon a difficulty which he had with his father,\nand went to Liverpool, whence he sailed in the ship Rialto,\nCaptain Holmes, for Boston.  Captain Holmes endeavored to get\nhim a passage back, but there being no vessel to sail for some\ntime, the boy left him, and went to board at a common sailor’s\nboarding-house, in Ann street, where he supported himself for a\nfew weeks by selling some of his valuables.  At length, according\nto his own account, being desirous of returning home, he went to\na shipping-office, where the shipping articles of the California\nwere open.  Upon asking where the ship was going, he was told by\nthe shipping-master that she was bound to California.  Not knowing\nwhere that was, he told him that he wanted to go to Europe, and\nasked if California was in Europe.  The shipping-master answered\nhim in a way which the boy did not understand, and advised him to\nship.  The boy signed the articles, received his advance, laid out\na little of it in clothes, and spent the rest, and was ready to\ngo on board, when, upon the morning of sailing, he heard that the\nship was bound upon the North-west Coast, on a two or three years’\nvoyage, and was not going to Europe.  Frightened at this prospect,\nhe slipped away when the crew was going aboard, wandered up into\nanother part of the town, and spent all the forenoon in straying\nabout the common, and the neighboring streets.",
        "Having no money, and all his clothes and other things being in\nthe chest, on board, and being a stranger, he became tired and\nhungry, and ventured down toward the shipping, to see if the vessel\nhad sailed.  He was just turning the corner of a street, when the\nshipping-master, who had been in search of him, popped upon him,\nseized him, and carried him on board.  He cried and struggled,\nand said he did not wish to go in the ship, but the topsails\nwere at the mast-head, the fasts just ready to be cast off, and\neverything in the hurry and confusion of departure, so that he was\nhardly noticed; and the few who did inquire about the matter were\ntold that it was merely a boy who had spent his advance and tried\nto run away.  Had the owners of the vessel known anything of the\nmatter, they would have interfered at once; but they either knew\nnothing of it, or heard, like the rest, that it was only an unruly\nboy who was sick of his bargain.  As soon as the boy found himself\nactually at sea, and upon a voyage of two or three years in length,\nhis spirits failed him; he refused to work, and became so miserable,\nthat Captain Arthur took him into the cabin, where he assisted\nthe steward, and occasionally pulled and hauled about decks.\nHe was in this capacity when we saw him; and though it was\nmuch better for him than the life in the forecastle, and the\nhard work, watching, and exposure, which his delicate frame could\nnot have borne, yet, to be joined with a black fellow in waiting\nupon a man whom he probably looked upon as but little, in point\nof education and manners, above one of his father’s servants, was\nalmost too much for his spirit to bear.  Had he entered upon his\nsituation of his own free will, he could have endured it; but to\nhave been deceived, and, in addition to that, forced into it,\nwas intolerable.  He made every effort to go home in our ship,\nbut his captain refused to part with him except in the way of\nexchange, and that he could not effect.  If this account of the\nwhole matter, which we had from the boy, and which was confirmed\nby all the crew, be correct, I cannot understand why Captain Arthur\nshould have refused to let him go, especially being a captain who\nhad the name, not only with that crew, but with all whom he had\never commanded, of an unusually kind-hearted man.",
        "The truth is, the unlimited power which merchant captains have, upon\nlong voyages on strange coasts, takes away a sense of responsibility,\nand too often, even in men otherwise well-disposed, substitutes\na disregard for the rights and feelings of others.  The lad was\nsent on shore to join the gang at the hide-house; from whence,\nI was afterwards rejoiced to hear, he effected his escape, and\nwent down to Callao in a small Spanish schooner; and from Callao,\nhe probably returned to England.",
        "Soon after the arrival of the California, I spoke to Captain Arthur\nabout Hope; and as he had known him on the voyage before, and was\nvery fond of him, he immediately went to see him, gave him proper\nmedicines, and, under such care, he began rapidly to recover.  The\nSaturday night before our sailing, I spent an hour in the oven,\nand took leave of my Kanaka friends; and, really, this was the\nonly thing connected with leaving California which was in any\nway unpleasant.  I felt an interest and affection for many of\nthese simple, true-hearted men, such as I never felt before\nbut for a near relation.  Hope shook me by the hand, said he\nshould soon be well again, and ready to work for me when I came\nupon the coast, next voyage, as officer of the ship; and told me\nnot to forget, when I became captain, how to be kind to the sick.\nOld “Mr. Bingham” and “King Mannini” went down to the boat with me,\nshook me heartily by the hand, wished us a good voyage, and went back\nto the oven, chanting one of their deep monotonous songs, the burden\nof which I gathered to be about us and our voyage.",
        "Sunday, May 8th.  This promised to be our last day in California. ",
        "Our forty thousand hides, thirty thousand horns, besides several\nbarrels of otter and beaver skins, were all stowed below, and the\nhatches calked down.  All our spare spars were taken on board and\nlashed; our water-casks secured; and our live stock, consisting\nof four bullocks, a dozen sheep, a dozen or more pigs, and three\nor four dozen of poultry, were all stowed away in their different\nquarters: the bullocks in the long-boat, the sheep in a pen on the\nfore-hatch, and the pigs in a sty under the bows of the long-boat,\nand the poultry in their proper coop; and the jolly-boat was full\nof hay for the sheep and bullocks.  Our unusually large cargo,\ntogether with the stores for a five months’ voyage, brought the\nship channels down into the water.  In addition to this, she had\nbeen steeved so thoroughly, and was so bound by the compression of\nher cargo, forced into her by so powerful machinery, that she was\nlike a man in a straight-jacket, and would be but a dull sailer,\nuntil she had worked herself loose.",
        "The California had finished discharging her cargo, and was to get\nunder weigh at the same time with us.  Having washed down decks and\ngot our breakfast, the two vessels lay side by side, in complete\nreadiness for sea, our ensigns hanging from the peaks, and our\ntall spars reflected from the glassy surface of the river, which,\nsince sunrise, had been unbroken by a ripple.  At length, a few\nwhiffs came across the water, and, by eleven o’clock, the regular\nnorth-west wind set steadily in.  There was no need of calling\nall hands, for we had all been hanging about the forecastle the\nwhole forenoon, and were ready for a start upon the first sign\nof a breeze.",
        "All eyes were aft upon the captain, who was walking the deck,\nwith, every now and then, a look to windward.  He made a sign\nto the mate, who came forward, took his station, deliberately\nbetween the knight-heads, cast a glance aloft, and called out,\n\"All hands, lay aloft and loose the sails!”  We were half in the\nrigging before the order came, and never since we left Boston\nwere the gaskets off the yards, and the rigging overhauled, in a\nshorter time.  “All ready forward, sir!\"–\"All ready the main!\"–\n\"Cross-jack yards all ready, sir!\"–\"Lay down, all hands but one\non each yard!”  The yard-arm and bunt gaskets were cast off; and\neach sail hung by the jigger, with one man standing by the tie to\nlet it go.  At the same moment that we sprang aloft, a dozen hands\nsprang into the rigging of the California, and in an instant were\nall over her yards; and her sails, too, were ready to be dropped at\nthe word.  In the mean time our bow gun had been loaded and run out,\nand its discharge was to be the signal for dropping sails.  A cloud\nof smoke came out of our bows; the echoes of the gun rattled our\nfarewell among the hills of California; and the two ships were\ncovered, from head to foot, with their white canvas.  For a few\nminutes, all was uproar and apparent confusion: men flying about\nlike monkeys in the rigging; ropes and blocks flying; orders given\nand answered, and the confused noises of men singing out at the\nropes.  The top-sails came to the mast-heads with “Cheerily,\nmen!” and, in a few minutes, every sail was set; for the wind\nwas light.  The head sails were backed, the windlass came round\n\"slip-slap” to the cry of the sailors;–\"Hove short, sir,” said\nthe mate;–\"Up with him!\"–\"Aye, aye, sir.\"–A few hearty and long\nheaves, and the anchor showed its head.  “Hook cat!\"–The fall was\nstretched along the decks; all hands laid hold;–\"Hurrah, for the\nlast time,” said the mate; and the anchor came to the cat-head to\nthe tune of “Time for us to go,” with a loud chorus.  Everything\nwas done quick, as though it were for the last time.  The head\nyards were filled away, and our ship began to move through the\nwater on her homeward-bound course.",
        "The California had got under weigh at the same moment; and we\nsailed down the narrow bay abreast and were just off the mouth,\nand finding ourselves gradually shooting ahead of her, were on\nthe point of giving her three parting cheers, when, suddenly, we\nfound ourselves stopped short, and the California ranging fast\nahead of us.  A bar stretches across the mouth of the harbor,\nwith water enough to float common vessels, but, being low in\nthe water, and having kept well to leeward, as we were bound\nto the southward, we had stuck fast, while the California,\nbeing light, had floated over.",
        "We kept all sail on, in the hope of forcing over, but failing in\nthis, we hove aback, and lay waiting for the tide, which was on\nthe flood, to take us back into the channel.  This was somewhat\nof a damper to us, and the captain looked not a little mortified\nand vexed.  “This is the same place where the Rosa got ashore,\"\nobserved the redheaded second mate, most mal-a-propos.  A malediction\non the Rosa, and him too, was all the answer he got, and he slunk\noff to leeward.  In a few minutes, the force of the wind and the\nrising of the tide backed us into the stream, and we were on our\nway to our old anchoring-place, the tide setting swiftly up, and\nthe ship barely manageable, in the light breeze.  We came-to, in\nour old berth, opposite the hide-house, whose inmates were not a\nlittle surprised to see us return.  We felt as though we were tied\nto California; and some of the crew swore that they never should\nget clear of the bloody coast.",
        "In about half an hour, which was near high water, the order was\ngiven to man the windlass, and again the anchor was catted; but not\na word was said about the last time.  The California had come back\non finding that we had returned, and was hove-to, waiting for us,\noff the point.  This time we passed the bar safely, and were soon\nup with the California, who filled away, and kept us company.",
        "She seemed desirous of a trial of speed, and our captain accepted\nthe challenge, although we were loaded down to the bolts of\nour chain plates, as deep as a sand-barge, and bound so taught\nwith our cargo that we were no more fit for a race than a man\nin fetters;–while our antagonist was in her best trim.  Being\nclear of the point, the breeze became stiff, and the royal masts\nbent under our sails, but we would not take them in until we saw\nthree boys spring aloft into the rigging of the California; when\nthey were all furled at once, but with orders to stay aloft at the\ntop-gallant mastheads, and loose them again at the word.  It was\nmy duty to furl the fore royal; and while standing by to loose\nit again, I had a fine view of the scene.  From where I stood,\nthe two vessels seemed nothing but spars and sails, while their\nnarrow decks, far below, slanting over by the force of the wind\naloft, appeared hardly capable of supporting the great fabrics\nraised upon them.  The California was to windward of us, and had\nevery advantage; yet, while the breeze was stiff, we held our\nown.  As soon as it began to slacken, she ranged a little ahead,\nand the order was given to loose the royals.  In an instant the\ngaskets were off and the bunt dropped.  “Sheet home the fore royal!\n–Weather sheet’s home!\"–\"Hoist away, sir!” is bawled from aloft.\n\"Overhaul your clew-lines!” shouts the mate.  “Aye, aye, sir, all\nclear!\"–\"Taught leech! belay!  Well the lee brace; haul taught to\nwindward\"–and the royals are set.  These brought us up again; but\nthe wind continuing light, the California set hers, and it was soon\nevident that she was walking away from us.  Our captain then hailed,\nand said that he should keep off to his course; adding–\"She isn’t\nthe Alert now.  If I had her in your trim, she would have been out\nof sight by this time.”  This was good-naturedly answered from the\nCalifornia, and she braced sharp up, and stood close upon the wind\nup the coast; while we squared away our yards, and stood before the\nwind to the south-south-west.  The California’s crew manned her\nweather rigging, waved their hats in the air, and gave up three\nhearty cheers, which we answered as heartily, and the customary\nsingle cheer came back to us from over the water.  She stood on\nher way, doomed to eighteen months’ or two years’ hard service upon\nthat hated coast, while we were making our way to our home, to which\nevery hour and every mile was bringing us nearer.",
        "As soon as we parted company with the California, all hands were\nsent aloft to set the studding-sails.  Booms were rigged out,\ntacks and halyards rove, sail after sail packed upon her, until\nevery available inch of canvas was spread, that we might not lose a\nbreath of the fair wind.  We could now see how much she was cramped\nand deadened by her cargo; for with a good breeze on her quarter,\nand every stitch of canvas spread, we could not get more than six\nknots out of her.  She had no more life in her than if she were\nwater-logged.  The log was hove several times; but she was doing\nher best.  We had hardly patience with her, but the older sailors\nsaid–\"Stand by! you’ll see her work herself loose in a week\nor two, and then she’ll walk up to Cape Horn like a race-horse.”",
        "When all sail had been set, and the decks cleared up, the California\nwas a speck in the horizon, and the coast lay like a low cloud along\nthe north-east.  At sunset they were both out of sight, and we were\nonce more upon the ocean where sky and water meet.",
        "At eight o’clock all hands were called aft, and the watches set for\nthe voyage.  Some changes were made; but I was glad to find myself\nstill in the larboard watch.  Our crew was somewhat diminished;\nfor a man and a boy had gone in the Pilgrim; another was second\nmate of the Ayacucho; and a third, the oldest man of the crew,\nhad broken down under the hard work and constant exposure on the\ncoast, and, having had a stroke of the palsy, was left behind at\nthe hide-house under the charge of Captain Arthur.  The poor fellow\nwished very much to come home in the ship; and he ought to have\nbeen brought home in her.  But a live dog is better than a dead\nlion, and a sick sailor belongs to nobody’s mess; so he was sent\nashore with the rest of the lumber, which was only in the way.\nBy these diminutions, we were short-handed for a voyage round\nCape Horn in the dead of winter.  Besides S––-  and myself,\nthere were only five in the forecastle; who, together with four\nboys in the steerage, the sailmaker, carpenter, etc., composed the\nwhole crew.  In addition to this, we were only three or four days\nout, when the sailmaker, who was the oldest and best seaman on\nboard, was taken with the palsy, and was useless for the rest of the\nvoyage.  The constant wading in the water, in all weathers, to take\noff hides, together with the other labors, is too much for old men,\nand for any who have not good constitutions.  Beside these two men\nof ours, the second officer of the California and the carpenter of\nthe Pilgrim broke down under the work, and the latter died at Santa\nBarbara.  The young man, too, who came out with us from Boston in\nthe Pilgrim, had to be taken from his berth before the mast and\nmade clerk, on account of a fit of rheumatism which attacked him\nsoon after he came upon the coast.  By the loss of the sailmaker,\nour watch was reduced to five, of whom two were boys, who never\nsteered but in fine weather, so that the other two and myself had\nto stand at the wheel four hours apiece out of every twenty-four;\nand the other watch had only four helmsmen.  “Never mind–we’re\nhomeward bound!” was the answer to everything; and we should not\nhave minded this, were it not for the thought that we should be\noff Cape Horn in the very dead of winter.  It was now the first\npart of May; and two months would bring us off the cape in July,\nwhich is the worst month in the year there; when the sun rises at\nnine and sets at three, giving eighteen hours night, and there is\nsnow and rain, gales and high seas, in abundance.",
        "The prospect of meeting this in a ship half manned, and loaded\nso deep that every heavy sea must wash her fore and aft, was by\nno means pleasant.  The Alert, in her passage out, doubled the\nCape in the month of February, which is midsummer; and we came\nround in the Pilgrim in the latter part of October, which we\nthought was bad enough.  There was only one of our crew who\nhad been off there in the winter, and that was in a whaleship,\nmuch lighter and higher than our ship; yet he said they had man-\nkilling weather for twenty days without intermission, and their\ndecks were swept twice, and they were all glad enough to see the\nlast of it.  The Brandywine frigate, also, in her passage round,\nhad sixty days off the Cape, and lost several boats by the heavy\nsea.  All this was for our comfort; yet pass it we must; and all\nhands agreed to make the best of it.",
        "During our watches below we overhauled our clothes, and made and\nmended everything for bad weather.  Each of us had made for himself\na suit of oil-cloth or tarpaulin, and these we got out, and gave\nthorough coatings of oil or tar, and hung upon the stays to dry.",
        "Our stout boots, too, we covered over with a thick mixture\nof melted grease and tar, and hung out to dry.  Thus we took\nadvantage of the warm sun and fine weather of the Pacific to\nprepare for its other face.  In the forenoon watches below,\nour forecastle looked like the workshop of what a sailor is,–a\nJack at all trades.  Thick stockings and drawers were darned and\npatched; mittens dragged from the bottom of the chest and mended;\ncomforters made for the neck and ears; old flannel shirts cut up\nto line monkey jackets; south-westers lined with flannel, and a\npot of paint smuggled forward to give them a coat on the outside;\nand everything turned to hand; so that, although two years had\nleft us but a scanty wardrobe, yet the economy and invention\nwhich necessity teaches a sailor, soon put each of us in pretty\ngood trim for bad weather, even before we had seen the last of the\nfine.  Even the cobbler’s art was not out of place.  Several old\nshoes were very decently repaired, and with waxed ends, an awl,\nand the top of an old boot, I made me quite a respectable sheath\nfor my knife.",
        "There was one difficulty, however, which nothing that we could do\nwould remedy; and that was the leaking of the forecastle, which made\nit very uncomfortable in bad weather, and rendered half of the\nberths tenantless.  The tightest ships, in a long voyage, from the\nconstant strain which is upon the bowsprit, will leak, more or less,\nround the heel of the bowsprit, and the bitts, which come down into\nthe forecastle; but, in addition to this, we had an unaccountable\nleak on the starboard bow, near the cat-head, which drove us\nfrom the forward berths on that side, and, indeed, when she was\non the starboard tack, from all the forward berths.  One of the\nafter berths, too, leaked in very bad weather; so that in a ship\nwhich was in other respects as tight as a bottle, and brought her\ncargo to Boston perfectly dry, we had, after every effort made to\nprevent it, in the way of caulking and leading, a forecastle with\nonly three dry berths for seven of us.  However, as there is never\nbut one watch below at a time, by ’turning in and out,’ we did\npretty well.  And there being, in our watch, but three of us who\nlived forward, we generally had a dry berth apiece in bad weather.(1)",
        "–––––––-\n1. On removing the cat-head, after the ship arrived at Boston, it was\nfound that there were two holes under it which had been bored for the\npurpose of driving tree-nails, and which, accidentally, had not been\nplugged up when the cat-head was placed over them.  This was sufficient\nto account for the leak, and for our not having been able to discover\nand stop it. \n–––––––-",
        "All this, however, was but anticipation.  We were still in fine\nweather in the North Pacific, running down the north-east trades,\nwhich we took on the second day after leaving San Diego. ",
        "Sunday, May 15th, one week out, we were in latitude 14° 56’ N.,\nlong.  116° 14’ W., having gone, by reckoning, over thirteen hundred\nmiles in seven days.  In fact, ever since leaving San Diego, we had\nhad a fair wind, and as much as we wanted of it.  For seven days,\nour lower and topmast studding-sails were set all the time, and our\nroyals and top-gallant studding-sails, whenever she could stagger\nunder them.  Indeed, the captain had shown, from the moment we got\nto sea, that he was to have no boy’s play, but that the ship had\ngot to carry all she could, and that he was going to make up, by\n\"cracking on” to her, what she wanted in lightness.  In this way,\nwe frequently made three degrees of latitude, besides something\nin longitude, in the course of twenty-four hours.–Our days were\nspent in the usual ship’s work.  The rigging which had become slack\nfrom being long in port was to be set up; breast backstays got up;\nstudding-sail booms rigged upon the main yard; and the royal studding-\nsails got ready for the light trades; ring-tail set; and new rigging\nfitted and sails got ready for Cape Horn.  For, with a ship’s gear,\nas well as a sailor’s wardrobe, fine weather must be improved to\nget ready for the bad to come.  Our forenoon watch below, as I\nhave said, was given to our own work, and our night watches were\nspent in the usual manner:–a trick at the wheel, a look-out on\nthe forecastle, a nap on a coil of rigging under the lee of the\nrail; a yarn round the windlass-end; or, as was generally my way,\na solitary walk fore and aft, in the weather waist, between the\nwindlass-end and the main tack.  Every wave that she threw aside\nbrought us nearer home, and every day’s observation at noon showed\na progress which, if it continued, would in less than five months,\ntake us into Boston Bay.  This is the pleasure of life at sea,\n–fine weather, day after day, without interruption,–fair wind,\nand a plenty of it,–and homeward bound.  Every one was in good\nhumor; things went right; and all was done with a will.  At the\ndog watch, all hands came on deck, and stood round the weather\nside of the forecastle, or sat upon the windlass, and sung sea\nsongs, and those ballads of pirates and highwaymen, which sailors\ndelight in.  Home, too, and what we should do when we got there,\nand when and how we should arrive, was no infrequent topic.\nEvery night, after the kids and pots were put away, and we had\nlighted our pipes and cigars at the galley, and gathered about\nthe windlass, the first question was,–",
        "“Well, Tom, what was the latitude to-day?”",
        "“Why fourteen, north, and she has been going seven knots ever since.”",
        "“Well, this will bring us up to the line in five days.”",
        "“Yes, but these trades won’t last twenty-four hours longer,\"\nsays an old salt, pointing with the sharp of his hand to leeward,\n–\"I know that by the look of the clouds.”",
        "Then came all manner of calculations and conjectures as to the\ncontinuance of the wind, the weather under the line, the south-east\ntrades, etc., and rough guesses as to the time the ship would be up\nwith the Horn; and some, more venturous, gave her so many days\nto Boston light, and offered to bet that she would not exceed it. ",
        "“You’d better wait till you get round Cape Horn,” says an old\ncroaker. ",
        "“Yes,” says another, “you may see Boston, but you’ve got to\n’smell hell’ before that good day.”",
        "Rumors also of what had been said in the cabin, as usual, found\ntheir way forward.  The steward had heard the captain say something\nabout the straits of Magellan, and the man at the wheel fancied\nhe had heard him tell the “passenger” that, if he found the wind\nahead and the weather very bad off the Cape, he should stick her\noff for New Holland, and come home round the Cape of Good Hope.",
        "This passenger–the first and only one we had had, except to go\nfrom port to port, on the coast, was no one else than a gentleman\nwhom I had known in my better days; and the last person I should\nhave expected to have seen on the coast of California–Professor\nN––-, of Cambridge.  I had left him quietly seated in the chair\nof Botany and Ornithology, in Harvard University; and the next I\nsaw of him, was strolling about San Diego beach, in a sailor’s\npea-jacket, with a wide straw hat, and barefooted, with his\ntrowsers roiled up to his knees, picking up stones and shells.\nHe had travelled overland to the North-west Coast, and come down\nin a small vessel to Monterey.  There he learned that there was a\nship at the leeward, about to sail for Boston; and, taking passage\nin the Pilgrim, which was then at Monterey, he came slowly down,\nvisiting the intermediate ports, and examining the trees, plants,\nearths, birds, etc., and joined us at San Diego shortly before\nwe sailed.  The second mate of the Pilgrim told me that they had\nan old gentleman on board who knew me, and came from the college\nthat I had been in.",
        "He could not recollect his name, but said he was a “sort of an\noldish man,” with white hair, and spent all his time in the bush,\nand along the beach, picking up flowers and shells, and such truck,\nand had a dozen boxes and barrels, full of them.  I thought over\neverybody who would be likely to be there, but could fix upon no\none; when, the next day, just as we were about to shove off from\nthe beach, he came down to the boat, in the rig I have described,\nwith his shoes in his hand, and his pockets full of specimens.\nI knew him at once, though I should not have been more surprised\nto have seen the Old South steeple shoot up from the hide-house.\nHe probably had no less difficulty in recognizing me.  As we left\nhome about the same time, we had nothing to tell one another;\nand, owing to our different situations on board, I saw but little\nof him on the passage home.  Sometimes, when I was at the wheel\nof a calm night, and the steering required no attention, and the\nofficer of the watch was forward, he would come aft and hold a\nshort yarn with me; but this was against the rules of the ship,\nas is, in fact, all intercourse between passengers and the crew.\nI was often amused to see the sailors puzzled to know what to make\nof him, and to hear their conjectures about him and his business.\nThey were as much puzzled as our old sailmaker was with the captain’s\ninstruments in the cabin.",
        "He said there were three:–the chro-nometer, the chre-nometer,\nand the the-nometer.  (Chronometer, barometer, and thermometer.)\nThe Pilgrim’s crew christened Mr. N. “Old Curious,” from his zeal\nfor curiosities, and some of them said that he was crazy, and that\nhis friends let him go about and amuse himself in this way.  Why\nelse a rich man (sailors call every man rich who does not work\nwith his hands, and wears a long coat and cravat) should leave a\nChristian country, and come to such a place as California, to pick\nup shells and stones, they could not understand.  One of them,\nhowever, an old salt, who had seen something more of the world\nashore, set all to rights, as he thought,–\"Oh, ’vast there!–You\ndon’t know anything about them craft.  I’ve seen them colleges,\nand know the ropes.  They keep all such things for cur’osities,\nand study ’em, and have men a’ purpose to go and get ’em.  This\nold chap knows what he’s about.  He a’n’t the child you take him\nfor.  He’ll carry all these things to the college, and if they\nare better than any that they have had before, he’ll be head of\nthe college.  Then, by-and-by, somebody else will go after some\nmore, and if they beat him, he’ll have to go again, or else give\nup his berth.  That’s the way they do it.  This old covey knows\nthe ropes.  He has worked a traverse over ’em, and come ’way out\nhere, where nobody’s ever been afore, and where they’ll never\nthink of coming.”  This explanation satisfied Jack; and as it\nraised Mr. N.’s credit for capacity, and was near enough to\nthe truth for common purposes, I did not disturb it.",
        "With the exception of Mr. N., we had no one on board but the\nregular ship’s company, and the live stock.  Upon this, we\nhad made a considerable inroad.  We killed one of the bullocks\nevery four days, so that they did not last us up to the line.\nWe, or, rather, they, then began upon the sheep and the poultry,\nfor these never come into Jack’s mess.(1)  The pigs were left",
        "–––––––-\n1. The customs as to the allowance of “grub” are very nearly the\nsame in all American merchantmen.  Whenever a pig is killed, the\nsailors have one mess from it.  The rest goes to the cabin.  The\nsmaller live stock, poultry, etc., they never taste.",
        "And, indeed, they do not complain of this, for it would take a great\ndeal to supply them with a good meal, and without the accompaniments,\n(which could hardly be furnished to them,) it would not be much better\nthan salt beef.  But even as to the salt beef, they are scarcely dealt\nfairly with; for whenever a barrel is opened, before any of the beef\nis put into the harness-cask, the steward comes up, and picks it\nall over, and takes out the best pieces, (those that have any fat\nin them) for the cabin.",
        "This was done in both the vessels I was in, and the men said that it\nwas usual in other vessels.  Indeed, it is made no secret, but some\nof the crew are usually called to help in assorting and putting away\nthe pieces.  By this arrangement the hard, dry pieces, which the\nsailors call “old horse,” come to their share.",
        "There is a singular piece of rhyme, traditional among sailors,\nwhich they say over such pieces of beef.  I do not know that\nit ever appeared in print before.  When seated round the kid,\nif a particularly bad piece is found, one of them takes it up,\nand addressing it, repeats these lines: “Old horse! old horse!\nwhat brought you here?”",
        "–\"From Sacarap to Portland pier\nI’ve carted stone this many a year:\nTill, killed by blows and sore abuse,\nThey salted me down for sailors’ use. ",
        "The sailors they do me despise:\nThey turn me over and damn my eyes;\nCut off my meat, and pick my bones,\nAnd pitch the rest to Davy Jones.”",
        "There is a story current among seamen, that a beef-dealer was\nconvicted, at Boston, of having sold old horse for ship’s stores,\ninstead of beef, and had been sentenced to be confined in jail,\nuntil he should eat the whole of it; and that he is now lying\nin Boston jail.  I have heard this story often, on board other\nvessels beside those of our own nation.  It is very generally\nbelieved, and is always highly commended, as a fair instance\nof retaliatory justice.\n–––––––-",
        "for the latter part of the voyage, for they are sailors, and can\nstand all weathers.  We had an old sow on board, the mother of a\nnumerous progeny, who had been twice round the Cape of Good Hope,\nand once round Cape Horn.  The last time going round, was very\nnearly her death.  We heard her squealing and moaning one dark\nnight, after it had been snowing and hailing for several hours,\nand getting into the sty, we found her nearly frozen to death.\nWe got some straw, an old sail, and other things, and wrapped her\nup in a corner of the sty, where she staid until we got into fine\nweather again.",
        "Wednesday, May 18th.  Lat. 9° 54’ N., long. 113° 17’ W.  The north-\neast trades had now left us, and we had the usual variable winds,\nwhich prevail near the line, together with some rain.  So long as\nwe were in these latitudes, we had but little rest in our watch on\ndeck at night, for, as the winds were light and variable, and we\ncould not lose a breath, we were all the watch bracing the yards,\nand taking in and making sail, and “humbugging” with our flying\nkites.  A little puff of wind on the larboard quarter, and then\n–\"larboard fore braces!” and studding-booms were rigged out,\nstudding-sails set alow and aloft, the yards trimmed, and jibs and\nspanker in; when it would come as calm as a duck-pond, and the man\nat the wheel stand with the palm of his hand up, feeling for the\nwind.  “Keep her off a little!”  “All aback forward, sir!” cries\na man from the forecastle.  Down go the braces again; in come\nthe studding-sails, all in a mess, which half an hour won’t set\nright; yards braced sharp up; and she’s on the starboard tack,\nclose hauled.",
        "The studding-sails must now be cleared away, and set up in the\ntops, and on the booms.  By the time this is done, and you are\nlooking out for a soft plank for a nap,–\"Lay aft here, and square\nin the head yards!” and the studding-sails are all set again on\nthe starboard side.  So it goes until it is eight bells,–call\nthe watch,–heave the log,–relieve the wheel, and go below\nthe larboard watch.",
        "Sunday, May 22d.  Lat. 5° 14’ N., long. 166° 45’ W.  We were now\na fortnight out, and within five degrees of the line, to which two\ndays of good breeze would take us; but we had, for the most part,\nwhat sailors call “an Irishman’s hurricane,–right up and down.”",
        "This day it rained nearly all day, and being Sunday, and nothing\nto do, we stopped up the scuppers and filled the decks with rain\nwater, and bringing all our clothes on deck, had a grand wash,\nfore and aft.  When this was through, we stripped to our drawers,\nand taking pieces of soap and strips of canvas for towels,\nwe turned-to and soaped, washed, and scrubbed one another down,\nto get off, as we said, the California dust; for the common wash\nin salt water, which is all Jack can get, being on an allowance of\nfresh, had little efficacy, and was more for taste than utility.\nThe captain was below all the afternoon, and we had something\nnearer to a Saturnalia than anything we had yet seen; for the\nmate came into the scuppers, with a couple of boys to scrub him,\nand got into a battle with them in heaving water.  By unplugging\nthe holes, we let the soap-suds off the decks, and in a short time\nhad a new supply of rain water, in which we had a grand rinsing.\nIt was surprising to see how much soap and fresh water did for\nthe complexions of many of us; how much of what we supposed to\nbe tan and sea-blacking, we got rid of.  The next day, the sun\nrising clear, the ship was covered, fore and aft, with clothes\nof all sorts, hanging out to dry.",
        "As we approached the line, the wind became more easterly, and\nthe weather clearer, and in twenty days from San Diego,–",
        "Saturday, May 28th, at about three P. M., with a fine breeze from\nthe east-south-east, we crossed the equator.  In twenty-four hours\nafter crossing the line, which was very unusual, we took the regular\nsouth-east trades.  These winds come a little from the eastward of\nsouth-east, and, with us, they blew directly from the east-south-\neast, which was fortunate for us, for our course was south-by-west,\nand we could thus go one point free.  The yards were braced so that\nevery sail drew, from the spanker to the flying-jib; and the upper\nyards being squared in a little, the fore and main top-gallant\nstudding-sails were set, and just drew handsomely.  For twelve\ndays this breeze blew steadily, not varying a point, and just so\nfresh that we could carry our royals; and, during the whole time,\nwe hardly started a brace.  Such progress did we make, that at the\nend of seven days from the time we took the breeze, on",
        "Sunday, June 5th, we were in lat. 19° 29’ S., and long. 118° 01’ W.,\nhaving made twelve hundred miles in seven days, very nearly\nupon a taught bowline.  Our good ship was getting to be herself\nagain, had increased her rate of sailing more than one-third since\nleaving San Diego.  The crew ceased complaining of her, and the\nofficers hove the log every two hours with evident satisfaction.\nThis was glorious sailing.  A steady breeze; the light trade-wind\nclouds over our heads; the incomparable temperature of the Pacific,\n–neither hot nor cold; a clear sun every day, and clear moon and\nstars each night; and new constellations rising in the south, and\nthe familiar ones sinking in the north, as we went on our course,\n–\"stemming nightly toward the pole.”  Already we had sunk the north\nstar and the Great Bear in the northern horizon, and all hands\nlooked out sharp to the southward for the Magellan Clouds, which,\neach succeeding night, we expected to make.  “The next time we see\nthe north star,” said one, “we shall be standing to the northward,\nthe other side of the Horn.” This was true enough, and no doubt it\nwould be a welcome sight; for sailors say that in coming home from\nround Cape Horn, and the Cape of Good Hope, the north star is the\nfirst land you make.",
        "These trades were the same that, in the passage out in the Pilgrim,\nlasted nearly all the way from Juan Fernandez to the line; blowing\nsteadily on our starboard quarter for three weeks, without our\nstarting a brace, or even brailing down the skysails.  Though we\nhad now the same wind, and were in the same latitude with the\nPilgrim on her passage out, yet we were nearly twelve hundred miles\nto the westward of her course; for the captain, depending upon the\nstrong south-west winds which prevail in high southern latitudes\nduring the winter months, took the full advantage of the trades,\nand stood well to the westward, so far that we passed within about\ntwo hundred miles of Ducie’s Island.",
        "It was this weather and sailing that brought to my mind a little\nincident that occurred on board the Pilgrim, while we were in the\nsame latitude.  We were going along at a great rate, dead before\nthe wind, with studding-sails out on both sides, alow and aloft,\non a dark night, just after midnight, and everything was as still\nas the grave, except the washing of the water by the vessel’s side;\nfor, being before the wind, with a smooth sea, the little brig,\ncovered with canvas, was doing great business, with very little\nnoise.  The other watch was below, and all our watch, except myself\nand the man at the wheel, were asleep under the lee of the boat.\nThe second mate, who came out before the mast, and was always very\nthick with me, had been holding a yarn with me, and just gone aft\nto his place on the quarter-deck, and I had resumed my usual\nwalk to and from the windlass-end, when, suddenly, we heard a\nloud scream coming from ahead, apparently directly from under\nthe bows.  The darkness, and complete stillness of the night,\nand the solitude of the ocean, gave to the sound a dreadful and\nalmost supernatural effect.  I stood perfectly still, and my heart\nbeat quick.",
        "The sound woke up the rest of the watch, who stood looking at one\nanother.  “What, in the name of God, is that?” said the second mate,\ncoming slowly forward.  The first thought I had was, that it might\nbe a boat, with the crew of some wrecked vessel, or perhaps the\nboat of some whaleship, out over night, and we had run them down\nin the darkness.  Another scream, but less loud than the first.\nThis started us, and we ran forward, and looked over the bows,\nand over the sides, to leeward, but nothing was to be seen or\nheard.  What was to be done.  Call the captain, and heave the\nship aback?  Just at this moment, in crossing the forecastle,\none of the men saw a light below, and looking down the scuttle,\nsaw the watch all out of their berths, and afoul of one poor\nfellow, dragging him out of his berth, and shaking him, to wake\nhim out of a nightmare.",
        "They had been waked out of their sleep, and as much alarmed at the\nscream as we were, and were hesitating whether to come on deck,\nwhen the second sound, coming directly from one of the berths,\nrevealed the cause of the alarm.  The fellow got a good shaking\nfor the trouble he had given.  We made a joke of the matter and\nwe could well laugh, for our minds were not a little relieved\nby its ridiculous termination.",
        "We were now close upon the southern tropical line, and, with\nso fine a breeze, were daily leaving the sun behind us, and drawing\nnearer to Cape Horn, for which it behoved us to make every\npreparation.  Our rigging was all examined and overhauled, and\nmended, or replaced with new, where it was necessary: new and\nstrong bobstays fitted in the place of the chain ones, which were\nworn out; the spritsail yard and martingale guys and back-ropes\nset well taught; bran new fore and main braces rove; top-gallant\nsheets, and wheel-ropes, made of green hide, laid up in the form of\nrope, were stretched and fitted; and new top-sail clewlines, etc.,\nrove; new fore-topmast back-stays fitted; and other preparations\nmade, in good season, that the ropes might have time to stretch\nand become limber before we got into cold weather. ",
        "Sunday, June 12th.  Lat. 26° 04’ S., 116° 31’ W.  We had now lost\nthe regular trades, and had the winds variable, principally from\nthe westward, and kept on, in a southerly course, sailing very\nnearly upon a meridian, and at the end of the week,",
        "Sunday, June 19th, were in lat. 34° 15’ S., and long. 116° 38’ W.",
        "There now began to be a decided change in the appearance of things.\nThe days became shorter and shorter; the sun running lower in its\ncourse each day, and giving less and less heat; and the nights so\ncold as to prevent our sleeping on deck; the Magellan Clouds in\nsight, of a clear night; the skies looking cold and angry; and,\nat times, a long, heavy, ugly sea, setting in from the southwards\ntold us what we were coming to.  Still, however, we had a fine,\nstrong breeze, and kept on our way, under as much sail as our\nship would bear.  Toward the middle of the week, the wind hauled\nto the southward, which brought us upon a taught bowline, made the\nship meet, nearly head on, the heavy swell which rolled from that\ndirection; and there was something not at all encouraging in the\nmanner in which she met it.  Being so deep and heavy, she wanted\nthe buoyancy which should have carried her over the seas, and she\ndropped heavily into them, the water washing over the decks; and\nevery now and then, when an unusually large sea met her fairly\nupon the bows, she struck it with a sound as dead and heavy as\nthat with which a sledge-hammer falls upon the pile, and took\nthe whole of it in upon the forecastle, and rising, carried it\naft in the scuppers, washing the rigging off the pins, and carrying\nalong with it everything which was loose on deck.  She had been\nacting in this way all of our forenoon watch below; as we could\ntell by the washing of the water over our heads, and the heavy\nbreaking of the seas against her bows, (with a sound as though\nshe were striking against a rock,) only the thickness of the\nplank from our heads, as we lay in our berths, which are directly\nagainst the bows.  At eight bells, the watch was called, and we\ncame on deck, one hand going aft to take the wheel, and another\ngoing to the galley to get the grub for dinner.  I stood on the\nforecastle, looking at the seas, which were rolling high, as far\nas the eye could reach, their tops white with foam, and the body\nof them of a deep indigo blue, reflecting the bright rays of the\nsun.  Our ship rose slowly over a few of the largest of them,\nuntil one immense fellow came rolling on, threatening to cover\nher, and which I was sailor enough to know, by “the feeling of\nher” under my feet, she would not rise over.  I sprang upon the\nknight-heads, and seizing hold of the fore-stay with my hands,\ndrew myself upon it.  My feet were just off the stanchion, when\nshe struck fairly into the middle of the sea, and it washed her\nfore and aft, burying her in the water.  As soon as she rose out\nof it, I looked aft, and everything forward of the main-mast,\nexcept the long-boat, which was griped and double-lashed down\nto the ring-bolts, was swept off clear.  The galley, the pig-sty,\nthe hen-coop, and a large sheep-pen which had been built upon the\nforehatch, were all gone, in the twinkling of an eye–leaving the\ndeck as clean as a chin new-reaped–and not a stick left, to show\nwhere they had stood.  In the scuppers lay the galley, bottom up,\nand a few boards floating about, the wreck of the sheep-pen,–and\nhalf a dozen miserable sheep floating among them, wet through,\nand not a little frightened at the sudden change that had come\nupon them.  As soon as the sea had washed by, all hands sprung\nout of the forecastle to see what had become of the ship and in\na few moments the cook and old Bill crawled out from under the\ngalley, where they had been lying in the water, nearly smothered,\nwith the galley over them.  Fortunately, it rested against the\nbulwarks, or it would have broken some of their bones.  When the\nwater ran off, we picked the sheep up, and put them in the long-\nboat, got the galley back in its place, and set things a little\nto rights; but, had not our ship had uncommonly high bulwarks and\nrail, everything must have been washed overboard, not excepting\nOld Bill and the cook.",
        "Bill had been standing at the galley-door, with the kid of beef in his\nhand for the forecastle mess, when, away he went, kid, beef, and all.\nHe held on to the kid till the last, like a good fellow, but the beef\nwas gone, and when the water had run off, we saw it lying high and dry,\nlike a rock at low tide–nothing could hurt that.  We took the loss\nof our beef very easily, consoling ourselves with the recollection\nthat the cabin had more to lose than we; and chuckled not a little\nat seeing the remains of the chicken-pie and pan-cakes floating in\nthe scuppers.  “This will never do!” was what some said, and every\none felt.  Here we were, not yet within a thousand miles of the\nlatitude of Cape Horn, and our decks swept by a sea not one half\nso high as we must expect to find there.  Some blamed the captain\nfor loading his ship so deep, when he knew what he must expect;\nwhile others said that the wind was always southwest, off the Cape,\nin the winter; and that, running before it, we should not mind the\nseas so much.  When we got down into the forecastle, Old Bill, who\nwas somewhat of a croaker,–having met with a great many accidents\nat sea–said that if that was the way she was going to act, we might\nas well make our wills, and balance the books at once, and put on\na clean shirt.  “’Vast there, you bloody old owl!  You’re always\nhanging out blue lights!  You’re frightened by the ducking you got\nin the scuppers, and can’t take a joke!  What’s the use in being\nalways on the look-out for Davy Jones?”  “Stand by!” says another,\n\"and we’ll get an afternoon watch below, by this scrape;” but in\nthis they were disappointed, for at two bells, all hands were\ncalled and set to work, getting lashings upon everything on deck;\nand the captain talked of sending down the long top-gallant masts;\nbut, as the sea went down toward night, and the wind hauled abeam,\nwe left them standing, and set the studding-sails. ",
        "The next day, all hands were turned-to upon unbending the old\nsails, and getting up the new ones; for a ship, unlike people\non shore, puts on her best suit in bad weather.  The old sails\nwere sent down, and three new topsails, and new fore and main\ncourses, jib, and fore-topmast staysail, which were made on\nthe coast, and never had been used, were bent, with a complete\nset of new earings, robands and reef-points; and reef-tackles\nwere rove to the courses, and spilling-lines to the top-sails.\nThese, with new braces and clew-lines, fore and aft, gave us a\ngood suit of running rigging.",
        "The wind continued westerly, and the weather and sea less rough\nsince the day on which we shipped the heavy sea, and we were\nmaking great progress under studding-sails, with our light sails\nall set, keeping a little to the eastward of south; for the captain,\ndepending upon westerly winds off the Cape, had kept so far to the\nwestward, that though we were within about five hundred miles of\nthe latitude of Cape Horn, we were nearly seventeen hundred miles\nto the westward of it.  Through the rest of the week, we continued\non with a fair wind, gradually, as we got more to the southward,\nkeeping a more easterly course, and bringing the wind on our\nlarboard quarter, until–",
        "Sunday, June 26th, when, having a fine, clear day, the captain\ngot a lunar observation, as well as his meridian altitude, which\nmade us in lat. 47° 50’ S., long. 113° 49’ W.; Cape Horn bearing,\naccording to my calculation, E. S. E. 1/2 E., and distant eighteen\nhundred miles.",
        "Monday, June 27th.  During the first part of this day, the wind\ncontinued fair, and, as we were going before it, it did not feel\nvery cold, so that we kept at work on deck, in our common clothes\nand round jackets.  Our watch had an afternoon watch below, for the\nfirst time since leaving San Diego, and having inquired of the third\nmate what the latitude was at noon, and made our usual guesses as\nto the time she would need, to be up with the Horn, we turned-\nin, for a nap.  We were sleeping away “at the rates of knots,\"\nwhen three knocks on the scuttle, and “All hands ahoy!” started\nus from our berths.  What could be the matter?  It did not appear\nto be blowing hard, and looking up through the scuttle, we could\nsee that it was a clear day, overhead; yet the watch were taking\nin sail.",
        "We thought there must be a sail in sight, and that we were about\nto heave-to and speak her; and were just congratulating ourselves\nupon it–for we had seen neither sail nor land since we had\nleft port–when we heard the mate’s voice on deck, (he turned-in\n\"all standing,” and was always on deck the moment he was called,)\nsinging out to the men who were taking in the studding-sails, and\nasking where his watch were.  We did not wait for a second call,\nbut tumbled up the ladder; and there, on the starboard bow, was a\nbank of mist, covering sea and sky, and driving directly for us.\nI had seen the same before, in my passage round in the Pilgrim,\nand knew what it meant, and that there was no time to be lost.\nWe had nothing on but thin clothes, yet there was not a moment\nto spare, and at it we went.",
        "The boys of the other watch were in the tops, taking in the top-\ngallant studding-sails, and the lower and topmast studding-sails\nwere coming down by the run.  It was nothing but “haul down and\nclew up,” until we got all the studding-sails in, and the royals,\nflying-jib, and mizen top-gallant sail furled, and the ship kept\noff a little, to take the squall.  The fore and main top-gallant\nsails were still on her, for the “old man” did not mean to be\nfrightened in broad daylight, and was determined to carry sail\ntill the last minute.",
        "We all stood waiting for its coming, when the first blast showed\nus that it was not be trifled with.  Rain, sleet, snow, and wind,\nenough to take our breath from us, and make the toughest turn his\nback to windward!  The ship lay nearly over on her beam-ends; the\nspars and rigging snapped and cracked; and her top-gallant masts\nbent like whip-sticks.  “Clew up the fore and main top-gallant\nsails!” shouted the captain, and all hands sprang to the clewlines.\nThe decks were standing nearly at an angle of forty-five degrees,\nand the ship going like a mad steed through the water, the whole\nforward part of her in a smother of foam.  The halyards were let\ngo and the yard clewed down, and the sheets started, and in a few\nminutes the sails smothered and kept in by clewlines and buntlines.\n–\"Furl ’em, sir?” asked the mate.–\"Let go the topsail halyards,\nfore and aft!” shouted the captain, in answer, at the top of his voice. \nDown came the topsail yards, the reef-tackles were manned and\nhauled out, and we climbed up to windward, and sprang into the\nweather rigging.  The violence of the wind, and the hail and sleet,\ndriving nearly horizontally across the ocean, seemed actually\nto pin us down to the rigging.  It was hard work making head\nagainst them.  One after another, we got out upon the yards.\nAnd here we had work to do; for our new sails, which had hardly\nbeen bent long enough to get the starch out of them, were as stiff\nas boards, and the new earings and reef-points, stiffened with the\nsleet, knotted like pieces of iron wire.  Having only our round\njackets and straw hats on, we were soon wet through, and it was\nevery moment growing colder.  Our hands were soon stiffened and\nnumbed, which, added to the stiffness of everything else, kept us\na good while on the yard.  After we had got the sail hauled upon\nthe yard, we had to wait a long time for the weather earing to\nbe passed; but there was no fault to be found, for French John\nwas at the earing, and a better sailor never laid out on a yard;\nso we leaned over the yard, and beat our hands upon the sail to\nkeep them from freezing.  At length the word came–\"Haul out\nto leeward,\"–and we seized the reef-points and hauled the band\ntaught for the lee earing.  “Taught band–Knot away,” and we got\nthe first reef fast, and were just going to lay down, when–\"Two\nreefs–two reefs!” shouted the mate, and we had a second reef to\ntake, in the same way.  When this was fast, we laid down on deck,\nmanned the halyards to leeward, nearly up to our knees in water,\nset the topsail, and then laid aloft on the main topsail yard,\nand reefed that sail in the same manner; for, as I have before\nstated, we were a good deal reduced in numbers, and, to make\nit worse, the carpenter, only two days before, cut his leg with\nan axe, so that he could not go aloft.  This weakened us so that\nwe could not well manage more than one topsail at a time, in such\nweather as this, and, of course, our labor was doubled.  From the\nmain topsail yard, we went upon the main yard, and took a reef in\nthe mainsail.  No sooner had we got on deck, than–\"Lay aloft there,\nmizen-top-men, and close-reef the mizen topsail!”  This called me;\nand being nearest to the rigging, I got first aloft, and out to\nthe weather earing.  English Ben was on the yard just after me,\nand took the lee earing, and the rest of our gang were soon on\nthe yard, and began to fist the sail, when the mate considerately\nsent up the cook and steward, to help us.  I could now account\nfor the long time it took to pass the other earings, for, to do\nmy best, with a strong hand to help me at the dog’s ear, I could\nnot get it passed until I heard them beginning to complain in the\nbunt.  One reef after another we took in, until the sail was close-\nreefed, when we went down and hoisted away at the halyards.  In the\nmean time, the jib had been furled and the staysail set, and the\nship, under her reduced sail, had got more upright and was under\nmanagement; but the two top-gallant sails were still hanging in\nthe buntlines, and slatting and jerking as though they would take\nthe masts out of her.  We gave a look aloft, and knew that our work\nwas not done yet; and, sure enough, no sooner did the mate see that\nwe were on deck, than–\"Lay aloft there, four of you, and furl the\ntop-gallant sails!” This called me again, and two of us went aloft,\nup the fore rigging, and two more up the main, upon the top-gallant\nyards.",
        "The shrouds were now iced over, the sleet having formed a crust\nor cake round all the standing rigging, and on the weather side\nof the masts and yards.  When we got upon the yard, my hands were\nso numb that I could not have cast off the knot of the gasket to\nhave saved my life.  We both lay over the yard for a few seconds,\nbeating our hands upon the sail, until we started the blood into\nour fingers’ ends, and at the next moment our hands were in a\nburning heat.  My companion on the yard was a lad, who came out\nin the ship a weak, puny boy, from one of the Boston schools,–\n\"no larger than a spritsail sheet knot,” nor “heavier than a\npaper of lamp-black,” and “not strong enough to haul a shad\noff a gridiron,” but who was now “as long as a spare topmast,\nstrong enough to knock down an ox, and hearty enough to eat him.\"\nWe fisted the sail together, and after six or eight minutes of hard\nhauling and pulling and beating down the sail, which was as stiff\nas sheet iron, we managed to get it furled; and snugly furled it\nmust be, for we knew the mate well enough to be certain that if\nit got adrift again, we should be called up from our watch below,\nat any hour of the night, to furl it.",
        "I had been on the look-out for a moment to jump below and clap on\na thick jacket and south-wester; but when we got on deck we found\nthat eight bells had been struck, and the other watch gone below,\nso that there were two hours of dog watch for us, and a plenty of\nwork to do.  It had now set in for a steady gale from the south-west;\nbut we were not yet far enough to the southward to make a fair wind\nof it, for we must give Terra del Fuego a wide berth.  The decks\nwere covered with snow, and there was a constant driving of sleet.\nIn fact, Cape Horn had set in with good earnest.  In the midst of\nall this, and before it became dark, we had all the studding-sails\nto make up and stow away, and then to lay aloft and rig in all the\nbooms, fore and aft, and coil away the tacks, sheets, and halyards.\nThis was pretty tough work for four or five hands, in the face of\na gale which almost took us off the yards, and with ropes so stiff\nwith ice that it was almost impossible to bend them.  I was nearly\nhalf an hour out on the end of the fore yard, trying to coil away\nand stop down the topmast studding-sail tack and lower halyards.\nIt was after dark when we got through, and we were not a little\npleased to hear four bells struck, which sent us below for two\nhours, and gave us each a pot of hot tea with our cold beef and\nbread, and, what was better yet, a suit of thick, dry clothing,\nfitted for the weather, in place of our thin clothes, which were\nwet through and now frozen stiff.",
        "This sudden turn, for which we were so little prepared, was as\nunacceptable to me as to any of the rest; for I had been troubled\nfor several days with a slight tooth-ache, and this cold weather,\nand wetting and freezing, were not the best things in the world\nfor it.",
        "I soon found that it was getting strong hold, and running over all\nparts of my face; and before the watch was out I went aft to the\nmate, who had charge of the medicine-chest, to get something for it. ",
        "But the chest showed like the end of a long voyage, for there was\nnothing that would answer but a few drops of laudanum, which must\nbe saved for any emergency; so I had only to bear the pain as well\nas I could.",
        "When we went on deck at eight bells, it had stopped snowing, and\nthere were a few stars out, but the clouds were still black, and it\nwas blowing a steady gale.  Just before midnight, I went aloft and\nsent down the mizen royal yard, and had the good luck to do it to\nthe satisfaction of the mate, who said it was done “out of hand\nand ship-shape.”  The next four hours below were but little relief\nto me, for I lay awake in my berth, the whole time, from the pain\nin my face, and heard every bell strike, and, at four o’clock,\nturned out with the watch, feeling little spirit for the hard\nduties of the day.",
        "Bad weather and hard work at sea can be borne up against very\nwell, if one only has spirit and health; but there is nothing\nbrings a man down, at such a time, like bodily pain and want\nof sleep.",
        "There was, however, too much to do to allow time to think;\nfor the gale of yesterday, and the heavy seas we met with a\nfew days before, while we had yet ten degrees more southing to\nmake, had convinced the captain that we had something before us\nwhich was not to be trifled with, and orders were given to send\ndown the long top-gallant masts.  The top-gallant and royal yards\nwere accordingly struck, the flying jib-boom rigged in, and the\ntop-gallant masts sent down on deck, and all lashed together by\nthe side of the long-boat.",
        "The rigging was then sent down and coiled away below, and everything\nwas made snug aloft.  There was not a sailor in the ship who was not\nrejoiced to see these sticks come down; for, so long as the yards\nwere aloft, on the least sign of a lull, the top-gallant sails were\nloosed, and then we had to furl them again in a snow-squall, and shin\nup and down single ropes caked with ice, and send royal yards down in\nthe teeth of a gale coming right from the south pole.  It was an\ninteresting sight, too, to see our noble ship, dismantled of all\nher top-hamper of long tapering masts and yards, and boom pointed\nwith spear-head, which ornamented her in port; and all that canvas,\nwhich a few days before had covered her like a cloud, from the\ntruck to the water’s edge, spreading far out beyond her hull on\neither side, now gone; and she, stripped, like a wrestler for\nthe fight.  It corresponded, too, with the desolate character\nof her situation;–alone, as she was, battling with storms,\nwind, and ice, at this extremity of the globe, and in almost\nconstant night.",
        "Friday, July 1st.  We were now nearly up to the latitude of Cape\nHorn, and having over forty degrees of easting to make, we squared\naway the yards before a strong westerly gale, shook a reef out of the\nfore-topsail, and stood on our way, east-by-south, with the prospect\nof being up with the Cape in a week or ten days.  As for myself,\nI had had no sleep for forty-eight hours; and the want of rest,\ntogether with constant wet and cold, had increased the swelling,\nso that my face was nearly as large as two, and I found it impossible\nto get my mouth open wide enough to eat.  In this state, the steward\napplied to the captain for some rice to boil for me, but he only\ngot a–\"No! d–- you! Tell him to eat salt junk and hard bread,\nlike the rest of them.”  For this, of course, I was much obliged\nto him, and in truth it was just what I expected.  However, I did\nnot starve, for the mate, who was a man as well as a sailor, and\nhad always been a good friend to me, smuggled a pan of rice into\nthe galley, and told the cook to boil it for me, and not let the\n\"old man” see it.  Had it been fine weather, or in port, I should\nhave gone below and lain by until my face got well; but in such\nweather as this, and short-handed as we were, it was not for me\nto desert my post; so I kept on deck, and stood my watch and did\nmy duty as well as I could.",
        "Saturday, July 2nd.  This day the sun rose fair, but it ran too\nlow in the heavens to give any heat, or thaw out our sails and\nrigging; yet the sight of it was pleasant; and we had a steady\n\"reef topsail breeze” from the westward.  The atmosphere, which had\npreviously been clear and cold, for the last few hours grew damp,\nand had a disagreeable, wet chilliness in it; and the man who came\nfrom the wheel said he heard the captain tell “the passenger” that\nthe thermometer had fallen several degrees since morning, which he\ncould not account for in any other way than by supposing that there\nmust be ice near us; though such a thing had never been heard of\nin this latitude, at this season of the year.  At twelve o’clock\nwe went below, and had just got through dinner, when the cook put\nhis head down the scuttle and told us to come on deck and see the\nfinest sight that we had ever seen.  “Where away, cook?” asked\nthe first man who was up.  “On the larboard bow.”  And there lay,\nfloating in the ocean, several miles off, an immense, irregular mass,\nits top and points covered with snow, and its center of a deep indigo\ncolor.",
        "This was an iceberg, and of the largest size, as one of our men said\nwho had been in the Northern ocean.  As far as the eye could reach,\nthe sea in every direction was of a deep blue color, the waves\nrunning high and fresh, and sparkling in the light, and in the\nmidst lay this immense mountain-island, its cavities and valleys\nthrown into deep shade, and its points and pinnacles glittering\nin the sun.",
        "All hands were soon on deck, looking at it, and admiring in various\nways its beauty and grandeur.  But no description can give any idea\nof the strangeness, splendor, and, really, the sublimity, of the sight. ",
        "Its great size;–for it must have been from two to three miles\nin circumference, and several hundred feet in height;–its\nslow motion, as its base rose and sank in the water, and its\nhigh points nodded against the clouds; the dashing of the waves\nupon it, which, breaking high with foam, lined its base with\na white crust; and the thundering sound of the cracking of\nthe mass, and the breaking and tumbling down of huge pieces;\ntogether with its nearness and approach, which added a slight\nelement of fear,–all combined to give to it the character of\ntrue sublimity.  The main body of the mass was, as I have said,\nof an indigo color, its base crusted with frozen foam; and as it\ngrew thin and transparent toward the edges and top, its color\nshaded off from a deep blue to the whiteness of snow.",
        "It seemed to be drifting slowly toward the north, so that we kept\naway and avoided it.  It was in sight all the afternoon; and when we\ngot to leeward of it, the wind died away, so that we lay-to quite\nnear it for a greater part of the night.  Unfortunately, there was\nno moon, but it was a clear night, and we could plainly mark the\nlong, regular heaving of the stupendous mass, as its edges moved\nslowly against the stars.  Several times in our watch loud cracks\nwere heard, which sounded as though they must have run through the\nwhole length of the iceberg, and several pieces fell down with a\nthundering crash, plunging heavily into the sea.  Toward morning,\na strong breeze sprang up, and we filled away, and left it astern,\nand at daylight it was out of sight.  The next day, which was",
        "Sunday, July 3d, the breeze continued strong, the air exceedingly\nchilly, and the thermometer low.  In the course of the day we saw\nseveral icebergs, of different sizes, but none so near as the\none which we saw the day before.  Some of them, as well as we\ncould judge, at the distance at which we were, must have been\nas large as that, if not larger.  At noon we were in latitude\n55° 12’ south, and supposed longitude 89° 5’ west.  Toward night\nthe wind hauled to the southward, and headed us off our course\na little, and blew a tremendous gale; but this we did not mind,\nas there was no rain nor snow, and we were already under close\nsail.",
        "Monday, July 4th.  This was “independence day” in Boston.\nWhat firing of guns, and ringing of bells, and rejoicings of\nall sorts, in every part of our country!  The ladies (who have\nnot gone down to Nahant, for a breath of cool air, and sight of\nthe ocean) walking the streets with parasols over their heads,\nand the dandies in their white pantaloons and silk stockings!\nWhat quantities of ice-cream have been eaten, and what quantities\nof ice brought into the city from a distance, and sold out by the\nlump and the pound!  The smallest of the islands which we saw\ntoday would have made the fortune of poor Jack, if he had had it\nin Boston; and I dare say he would have had no objection to being\nthere with it.  This, to be sure, was no place to keep the fourth\nof July.  To keep ourselves warm, and the ship out of the ice,\nwas as much as we could do.  Yet no one forgot the day; and many\nwere the wishes, and conjectures, and comparisons, both serious and\nludicrous, which were made among all hands.  The sun shone bright\nas long as it was up, only that a scud of black clouds was ever\nand anon driving across it.  At noon we were in lat. 54° 27’ S.,\nand long. 85° 5’ W., having made a good deal of easting, but having\nlost in our latitude by the heading of the wind.  Between daylight\nand dark–that is, between nine o’clock and three–we saw thirty-\nfour ice islands, of various sizes; some no bigger than the hull\nof our vessel, and others apparently nearly as large as the one\nthat we first saw; though, as we went on, the islands became\nsmaller and more numerous; and, at sundown of this day, a man at\nthe mast-head saw large fields of floating ice called “field-ice\"\nat the south-east.  This kind of ice is much more dangerous than\nthe large islands, for those can be seen at a distance, and kept\naway from; but the field-ice, floating in great quantities, and\ncovering the ocean for miles and miles, in pieces of every size-\n-large, flat, and broken cakes, with here and there an island\nrising twenty and thirty feet, and as large as the ship’s hull;–\nthis, it is very difficult to sheer clear of.  A constant look-out\nwas necessary; for any of these pieces, coming with the heave\nof the sea, were large enough to have knocked a hole in the ship,\nand that would have been the end of us; for no boat (even if we\ncould have got one out) could have lived in such a sea; and no man\ncould have lived in a boat in such weather.  To make our condition\nstill worse, the wind came out due east, just after sundown, and it\nblew a gale dead ahead, with hail and sleet, and a thick fog, so that\nwe could not see half the length of the ship.  Our chief reliance,\nthe prevailing westerly gales, was thus cut off; and here we were,\nnearly seven hundred miles to the westward of the Cape, with a gale\ndead from the eastward, and the weather so thick that we could not\nsee the ice with which we were surrounded, until it was directly\nunder our bows.",
        "At four, P. M. (it was then quite dark) all hands were called, and sent\naloft in a violent squall of hail and rain, to take in sail.  We had\nnow all got on our “Cape Horn rig\"–thick boots, south-westers coming\ndown over our neck and ears, thick trowsers and jackets, and some with\noil-cloth suits over all.  Mittens, too, we wore on deck, but it would\nnot do to go aloft with them on, for it was impossible to work with\nthem, and, being wet and stiff, they might let a man slip overboard,\nfor all the hold he could get upon a rope; so, we were obliged to\nwork with bare hands, which, as well as our faces, were often cut\nwith the hail-stones, which fell thick and large.  Our ship was\nnow all cased with ice,–hull, spars, and standing rigging;–and\nthe running rigging so stiff that we could hardly bend it so as\nto belay it, or, still worse, take a knot with it; and the sails\nnearly as stiff as sheet iron.  One at a time, (for it was a long\npiece of work and required many hands,) we furled the courses,\nmizen topsail, and fore-topmast staysail, and close-reefed the\nfore and main topsails, and hove the ship to under the fore,\nwith the main hauled up by the clewlines and buntlines, and ready\nto be sheeted home, if we found it necessary to make sail to get\nto windward of an ice island.  A regular look-out was then set,\nand kept by each watch in turn, until the morning.  It was a tedious\nand anxious night.  It blew hard the whole time, and there was an\nalmost constant driving of either rain, hail, or snow.  In addition\nto this, it was “as thick as muck,” and the ice was all about us.\nThe captain was on deck nearly the whole night, and kept the\ncook in the galley, with a roaring fire, to make coffee for him,\nwhich he took every few hours, and once or twice gave a little to\nhis officers; but not a drop of anything was there for the crew.\nThe captain, who sleeps all the daytime, and comes and goes at\nnight as he chooses, can have his brandy and water in the cabin,\nand his hot coffee at the galley; while Jack, who has to stand\nthrough everything, and work in wet and cold, can have nothing\nto wet his lips or warm his stomach.",
        "This was a “temperance ship,” and, like too many such ships, the\ntemperance was all in the forecastle.  The sailor, who only takes\nhis one glass as it is dealt out to him, is in danger of being drunk;\nwhile the captain, who has all under his hand, and can drink as much\nas he chooses, and upon whose self-possession and cool judgment the\nlives of all depend, may be trusted with any amount, to drink at\nhis will.  Sailors will never be convinced that rum is a dangerous\nthing, by taking it away from them, and giving it to the officers;\nnor that, that temperance is their friend, which takes from them\nwhat they have always had, and gives them nothing in the place of\nit.  By seeing it allowed to their officers, they will not be\nconvinced that it is taken from them for their good; and by\nreceiving nothing in its place, they will not believe that\nit is done in kindness.  On the contrary, many of them look\nupon the change as a new instrument of tyranny.  Not that\nthey prefer rum. I never knew a sailor, in my life, who would\nnot prefer a pot of hot coffee or chocolate, in a cold night,\nto all the rum afloat. They all say that rum only warms them for\na time; yet, if they can get nothing better, they will miss what\nthey have lost. The momentary warmth and glow from drinking it;\nthe break and change which is made in a long, dreary watch by\nthe mere calling all hands aft and serving of it out; and the\nsimply having some event to look forward to, and to talk about;\ngive it an importance and a use which no one can appreciate who\nhas not stood his watch before the mast. On my passage round Cape\nHorn before, the vessel that I was in was not under temperance\narticles, and grog was served out every middle and morning watch,\nand after every reefing of topsails; and though I had never drank\nrum before, and never intend to again, I took my allowance then\nat the capstan, as the rest did, merely for the momentary warmth\nit gave the system, and the change in our feelings and aspect of\nour duties on the watch.  At the same time, as I have stated,\nthere was not a man on board who would not have pitched the rum\nto the dogs, (I have heard them say so, a dozen times) for a\npot of coffee or chocolate; or even for our common beverage–\n\"water bewitched, and tea begrudged,” as it was.(1)",
        "–––––––-\n1.  The proportions of the ingredients of the tea that was made for\nus (and ours, as I have before stated, was a favorable specimen of\nAmerican merchantmen) were, a pint of tea, and a pint and a half\nof molasses, to about three gallons of water.",
        "These are all boiled down together in the “coppers,” and before\nserving it out, the mess is stirred up with a stick, so as to give\neach man his fair share of sweetening and tea-leaves.  The tea\nfor the cabin is, of course, made in the usual way, in a tea-pot,\nand drank with sugar.\n–––––––-",
        "The temperance reform is the best thing that ever was undertaken\nfor the sailor; but when the grog is taken from him, he ought to\nhave something in its place.  As it is now, in most vessels, it is a\nmere saving to the owners; and this accounts for the sudden increase\nof temperance ships, which surprised even the best friends of the\ncause.  If every merchant, when he struck grog from the list of\nthe expenses of his ship, had been obliged to substitute as much\ncoffee, or chocolate, as would give each man a pot-full when he\ncame off the topsail yard, on a stormy night;–I fear Jack might\nhave gone to ruin on the old road.(2)  But this is not doubling",
        "–––––––-\n(2) I do not wish these remarks, so far as they relate to the\nsaving of expense in the outfit, to be applied to the owners\nof our ship, for she was supplied with an abundance of stores,\nof the best kind that are given to seamen;, though the dispensing\nof them is necessarily left to the captain, Indeed, so high was\nthe reputation of “the employ” among men and officers, for the\ncharacter and outfit of their vessels, and for their liberality\nin conducting their voyages, that when it was known that they had\na ship fitting out for a long voyage, and that hands were to be\nshipped at a certain time,–a half hour before the time, as one of\nthe crew told me, numbers of sailors were steering down the wharf,\nhopping over the barrels, like flocks of sheep.\n–––––––-",
        "Cape Horn.  Eight hours of the night, our watch was on deck, and\nduring the whole of that time we kept a bright look-out: one man\non each bow, another in the bunt of the fore yard, the third mate\non the scuttle, one on each quarter, and a man always standing by\nthe wheel.  The chief mate was everywhere, and commanded the ship\nwhen the captain was below.",
        "When a large piece of ice was seen in our way, or drifting near us,\nthe word was passed along, and the ship’s head turned one way and\nanother; and sometimes the yards squared or braced up.  There was\nlittle else to do than to look out; and we had the sharpest eyes in\nthe ship on the forecastle.  The only variety was the monotonous\nvoice of the look-out forward–\"Another island!\"–\"Ice ahead!\"–\n\"Ice on the lee bow!\"–\"Hard up the helm!\"–\"Keep her off a\nlittle!\"–\"Stead-y!”",
        "In the meantime, the wet and cold had brought my face into such\na state that I could neither eat nor sleep; and though I stood it\nout all night, yet, when it became light, I was in such a state,\nthat all hands told me I must go below, and lie-by for a day or\ntwo, or I should be laid up for a long time, and perhaps have the\nlock-jaw.",
        "When the watch was changed I went into the steerage, and took off\nmy hat and comforter, and showed my face to the mate, who told me\nto go below at once, and stay in my berth until the swelling went\ndown, and gave the cook orders to make a poultice for me, and said\nhe would speak to the captain.",
        "I went below and turned-in, covering myself over with blankets\nand jackets, and lay in my berth nearly twenty-four hours, half\nasleep and half awake, stupid, from the dull pain.  I heard the\nwatch called, and the men going up and down, and sometimes a\nnoise on deck, and a cry of “ice,” but I gave little attention\nto anything.  At the end of twenty-four hours the pain went down,\nand I had a long sleep, which brought me back to my proper state;\nyet my face was so swollen and tender, that I was obliged to keep\nto my berth for two or three days longer.  During the two days I\nhad been below, the weather was much the same that it had been,\nhead winds, and snow and rain; or, if the wind came fair, too foggy,\nand the ice too thick, to run.  At the end of the third day the ice\nwas very thick; a complete fog-bank covered the ship.  It blew a\ntremendous gale from the eastward, with sleet and snow, and there\nwas every promise of a dangerous and fatiguing night.  At dark,\nthe captain called all hands aft, and told them that not a man was\nto leave the deck that night; that the ship was in the greatest\ndanger; any cake of ice might knock a hole in her, or she might\nrun on an island and go to pieces.  No one could tell whether she\nwould be a ship the next morning.  The look-outs were then set,\nand every man was put in his station.  When I heard what was the\nstate of things, I began to put on my clothes to stand it out\nwith the rest of them, when the mate came below, and looking at\nmy face, ordered me back to my berth, saying that if we went down,\nwe should all go down together, but if I went on deck I might lay\nmyself up for life.  This was the first word I had heard from aft;\nfor the captain had done nothing, nor inquired how I was, since I\nwent below.",
        "In obedience to the mate’s orders, I went back to my berth; but a\nmore miserable night I never wish to spend.  I never felt the curse\nof sickness so keenly in my life.  If I could only have been on deck\nwith the rest, where something was to be done, and seen, and heard;\nwhere there were fellow-beings for companions in duty and danger–but\nto be cooped up alone in a black hole, in equal danger, but without the\npower to do, was the hardest trial.  Several times, in the course of\nthe night, I got up, determined to go on deck; but the silence which\nshowed that there was nothing doing, and the knowledge that I might\nmake myself seriously ill, for nothing, kept me back.  It was not\neasy to sleep, lying, as I did, with my head directly against the\nbows, which might be dashed in by an island of ice, brought down\nby the very next sea that struck her.  This was the only time I\nhad been ill since I left Boston, and it was the worst time it\ncould have happened.  I felt almost willing to bear the plagues\nof Egypt for the rest of the voyage, if I could but be well and\nstrong for that one night.  Yet it was a dreadful night for those\non deck.",
        "A watch of eighteen hours, with wet, and cold, and constant anxiety,\nnearly wore them out; and when they came below at nine o’clock for\nbreakfast, they almost dropped asleep on their chests, and some\nof them were so stiff that they could with difficulty sit down.\nNot a drop of anything had been given them during the whole time,\n(though the captain, as on the night that I was on deck, had his\ncoffee every four hours,) except that the mate stole a potful of\ncoffee for two men to drink behind the galley, while he kept a\nlook-out for the captain.  Every man had his station, and was not\nallowed to leave it; and nothing happened to break the monotony\nof the night, except once setting the main topsails to run clear\nof a large island to leeward, which they were drifting fast upon.\nSome of the boys got so sleepy and stupefied, that they actually\nfell asleep at their posts; and the young third mate, whose station\nwas the exposed one of standing on the fore scuttle, was so stiff,\nwhen he was relieved, that he could not bend his knees to get down.\nBy a constant look-out, and a quick shifting of the helm, as the\nislands and pieces came in sight, the ship went clear of everything\nbut a few small pieces, though daylight showed the ocean covered for\nmiles.  At daybreak it fell a dead calm, and with the sun, the fog\ncleared a little, and a breeze sprung up from the westward, which soon\ngrew into a gale.  We had now a fair wind, daylight, and comparatively\nclear weather; yet, to the surprise of every one, the ship continued\nhove-to.  Why does not he run?  What is the captain about? was asked\nby every one; and from questions, it soon grew into complaints and\nmurmurings.  When the daylight was so short, it was too bad to\nlose it, and a fair wind, too, which every one had been praying\nfor.  As hour followed hour, and the captain showed no sign of\nmaking sail, the crew became impatient, and there was a good deal\nof talking and consultation together, on the forecastle.  They had\nbeen beaten out with the exposure and hardship, and impatient to\nget out of it, and this unaccountable delay was more than they\ncould bear in quietness, in their excited and restless state.\nSome said that the captain was frightened,–completely cowed,\nby the dangers and difficulties that surrounded us, and was afraid\nto make sail; while others said that in his anxiety and suspense\nhe had made a free use of brandy and opium, and was unfit for\nhis duty.  The carpenter, who was an intelligent man, and a\nthorough seaman, and had great influence with the crew,\ncame down into the forecastle, and tried to induce the crew to\ngo aft and ask the captain why he did not run, or request him,\nin the name of all hands, to make sail.  This appeared to be a\nvery reasonable request, and the crew agreed that if he did not\nmake sail before noon, they would go aft.  Noon came, and no sail\nwas made.  A consultation was held again, and it was proposed to\ntake the ship from the captain and give the command of her to the\nmate, who had been heard to say that, if he could have his way,\nthe ship would have been half the distance to the Cape before\nnight,–ice or no ice.  And so irritated and impatient had the\ncrew become, that even this proposition, which was open mutiny,\npunishable with state prison, was entertained, and the carpenter\nwent to his berth, leaving it tacitly understood that something\nserious would be done, if things remained as they were many hours\nlonger.  When the carpenter left, we talked it all over, and I gave\nmy advice strongly against it.  Another of the men, too, who had\nknown something of the kind attempted in another ship by a crew\nwho were dissatisfied with their captain, and which was followed\nwith serious consequences, was opposed to it.  S––-, who soon\ncame down, joined us, and we determined to have nothing to do\nwith it.  By these means, they were soon induced to give it up,\nfor the present, though they said they would not lie where they\nwere much longer without knowing the reason.",
        "The affair remained in this state until four o’clock, when an\norder came forward for all hands to come aft upon the quarter-\ndeck.  In about ten minutes they came forward again, and the\nwhole affair had been blown.  The carpenter, very prematurely,\nand without any authority from the crew, had sounded the mate\nas to whether he would take command of the ship, and intimated\nan intention to displace the captain; and the mate, as in duty\nbound, had told the whole to the captain, who immediately sent\nfor all hands aft.  Instead of violent measures, or, at least,\nan outbreak of quarter-deck bravado, threats, and abuse, which\nthey had every reason to expect, a sense of common danger and\ncommon suffering seemed to have tamed his spirit, and begotten\nsomething like a humane fellow-feeling; for he received the crew\nin a manner quiet, and even almost kind.  He told them what he\nhad heard, and said that he did not believe that they would try\nto do any such thing as was intimated; that they had always been\ngood men,–obedient, and knew their duty, and he had no fault to\nfind with them; and asked them what they had to complain of–said\nthat no one could say that he was slow to carry sail, (which was\ntrue enough;) and that, as soon as he thought it was safe and\nproper, he should make sail.  He added a few words about their\nduty in their present situation, and sent them forward, saying\nthat he should take no further notice of the matter; but, at the\nsame time, told the carpenter to recollect whose power he was in,\nand that if he heard another word from him he would have cause to\nremember him to the day of his death.",
        "This language of the captain had a very good effect upon the crew,\nand they returned quietly to their duty. ",
        "For two days more the wind blew from the southward and eastward;\nor in the short intervals when it was fair, the ice was too thick\nto run; yet the weather was not so dreadfully bad, and the crew had\nwatch and watch.  I still remained in my berth, fast recovering,\nyet still not well enough to go safely on deck.  And I should\nhave been perfectly useless; for, from having eaten nothing for\nnearly a week, except a little rice, which I forced into my mouth\nthe last day or two, I was as weak as an infant.  To be sick in a\nforecastle is miserable indeed.  It is the worst part of a dog’s\nlife; especially in bad weather.  The forecastle, shut up tight\nto keep out the water and cold air;–the watch either on deck,\nor asleep in their berths;–no one to speak to;–the pale light of\nthe single lamp, swinging to and fro from the beam, so dim that\none can scarcely see, much less read by it;–the water dropping\nfrom the beams and carlines, and running down the sides; and the\nforecastle so wet, and dark, and cheerless, and so lumbered up\nwith chests and wet clothes, that sitting up is worse than lying\nin the berth!  These are some of the evils.  Fortunately, I needed\nno help from any one, and no medicine; and if I had needed help,\nI don’t know where I should have found it.  Sailors are willing\nenough; but it is true, as is often said–No one ships for nurse\non board a vessel.  Our merchant ships are always under-manned,\nand if one man is lost by sickness, they cannot spare another\nto take care of him.  A sailor is always presumed to be well,\nand if he’s sick, he’s a poor dog.  One has to stand his wheel,\nand another his lookout, and the sooner he gets on deck again,\nthe better.",
        "Accordingly, as soon as I could possibly go back to my duty,\nI put on my thick clothes and boots and south-wester, and made\nmy appearance on deck.  Though I had been but a few days below,\nyet everything looked strangely enough.  The ship was cased in\nice,–decks, sides, masts, yards, and rigging.  Two close-reefed\ntop-sails were all the sail she had on, and every sail and rope\nwas frozen so stiff in its place, that it seemed as though it\nwould be impossible to start anything.  Reduced, too, to her top-\nmasts, she had altogether a most forlorn and crippled appearance.\nThe sun had come up brightly; the snow was swept off the decks,\nand ashes thrown upon them, so that we could walk, for they had\nbeen as slippery as glass.",
        "It was, of course, too cold to carry on any ship’s work, and we had\nonly to walk the deck and keep ourselves warm.  The wind was still\nahead, and the whole ocean, to the eastward, covered with islands\nand field-ice.  At four bells the order was given to square away\nthe yards; and the man who came from the helm said that the captain\nhad kept her off to N. N. E.  What could this mean?  Some said that\nhe was going to put into Valparaiso, and winter, and others that\nhe was going to run out of the ice and cross the Pacific, and go\nhome round the Cape of Good Hope.  Soon, however, it leaked out,\nand we found that we were running for the straits of Magellan.\nThe news soon spread through the ship, and all tongues were at\nwork, talking about it.  No one on board had been through the\nstraits, but I had in my chest an account of the passage of the\nship A. J. Donelson, of New York, through those straits, a few\nyears before.",
        "The account was given by the captain, and the representation was\nas favorable as possible.  It was soon read by every one on board,\nand various opinions pronounced.  The determination of our captain\nhad at least this good effect; it gave every one something to\nthink and talk about, made a break in our life, and diverted our\nminds from the monotonous dreariness of the prospect before us.\nHaving made a fair wind of it, we were going off at a good rate,\nand leaving the thickest of the ice behind us.  This, at least,\nwas something.",
        "Having been long enough below to get my hands well warmed and\nsoftened, the first handling of the ropes was rather tough; but a\nfew days hardened them, and as soon as I got my mouth open wide\nenough to take in a piece of salt beef and hard bread, I was all\nright again.",
        "Sunday, July 10th.  Lat. 54° 10’, long. 79° 07’.  This was our\nposition at noon.  The sun was out bright; the ice was all left\nbehind, and things had quite a cheering appearance.  We brought\nour wet pea-jackets and trowsers on deck, and hung them up in\nthe rigging, that the breeze and the few hours of sun might dry\nthem a little; and, by the permission of the cook, the galley\nwas nearly filled with stockings and mittens, hung round to be\ndried.  Boots, too, were brought up; and having got a little tar\nand slush from below, we gave them a thick coat.  After dinner,\nall hands were turned-to, to get the anchors over the bows,\nbend on the chains, etc. The fish-tackle was got up, fish-davit\nrigged out, and after two or three hours of hard and cold work,\nboth the anchors were ready for instant use, a couple of kedges\ngot up, a hawser coiled away upon the fore-hatch, and the deep-sea-\nlead-line overhauled and got ready.  Our spirits returned with having\nsomething to do; and when the tackle was manned to bowse the anchor\nhome, notwithstanding the desolation of the scene, we struck up\n\"Cheerily ho!” in full chorus.  This pleased the mate, who rubbed\nhis hands and cried out–\"That’s right, my boys; never say die!\nThat sounds like the old crew!” and the captain came up, on hearing\nthe song, and said to the passenger, within hearing of the man at\nthe wheel,–\"That sounds like a lively crew.  They’ll have their\nsong so long as there’re enough left for a chorus!”",
        "This preparation of the cable and anchors was for the passage\nof the straits; for, being very crooked, and with a variety of\ncurrents, it is necessary to come frequently to anchor.  This was\nnot, by any means, a pleasant prospect, for, of all the work that\na sailor is called upon to do in cold weather, there is none so\nbad as working the ground-tackle.  The heavy chain cables to be\nhauled and pulled about the decks with bare hands; wet hawsers,\nslip-ropes, and buoy-ropes to be hauled aboard, dripping in water,\nwhich is running up your sleeves, and freezing; clearing hawse\nunder the bows; getting under weigh and coming-to, at all hours\nof the night and day, and a constant look-out for rocks and sands\nand turns of tides;–these are some of the disagreeables of such\na navigation to a common sailor.  Fair or foul, he wants to have\nnothing to do with the ground-tackle between port and port.  One of\nour hands, too, had unluckily fallen upon a half of an old newspaper\nwhich contained an account of the passage, through the straits, of a\nBoston brig, called, I think, the Peruvian, in which she lost every\ncable and anchor she had, got aground twice, and arrived at\nValparaiso in distress.  This was set off against the account of\nthe A. J. Donelson, and led us to look forward with less confidence\nto the passage, especially as no one on board had ever been through,\nand the captain had no very perfect charts.  However, we were spared\nany further experience on the point; for the next day, when we must\nhave been near the Cape of Pillars, which is the south-west point\nof the mouth of the straits, a gale set in from the eastward, with a\nheavy fog, so that we could not see half of the ship’s length ahead.\nThis, of course, put an end to the project, for the present; for a\nthick fog and a gale blowing dead ahead are not the most favorable\ncircumstances for the passage of difficult and dangerous straits.\nThis weather, too, seemed likely to last for some time, and we\ncould not think of beating about the mouth of the straits for a\nweek or two, waiting for a favorable opportunity; so we braced up\non the larboard tack, put the ship’s head due south, and struck\nher off for Cape Horn again.",
        "In our first attempt to double the Cape, when we came up to the\nlatitude of it, we were nearly seventeen hundred miles to the\nwestward, but, in running for the straits of Magellan, we stood so\nfar to the eastward, that we made our second attempt at a distance\nof not more than four or five hundred miles; and we had great hopes,\nby this means, to run clear of the ice; thinking that the easterly\ngales, which had prevailed for a long time, would have driven it\nto the westward.  With the wind about two points free, the yards\nbraced in a little, and two close-reefed topsails and a reefed\nforesail on the ship, we made great way toward the southward and,\nalmost every watch, when we came on deck, the air seemed to grow\ncolder, and the sea to run higher.  Still, we saw no ice, and had\ngreat hopes of going clear of it altogether, when, one afternoon,\nabout three o’clock, while we were taking a siesta during our\nwatch below, “All hands!” was called in a loud and fearful voice.\n\"Tumble up here, men!–tumble up!–don’t stop for your clothes–\nbefore we’re upon it!”  We sprang out of our berths and hurried\nupon deck.",
        "The loud, sharp voice of the captain was heard giving orders,\nas though for life or death, and we ran aft to the braces,\nnot waiting to look ahead, for not a moment was to be lost.\nThe helm was hard up, the after yards shaking, and the ship\nin the act of wearing.",
        "Slowly, with stiff ropes and iced rigging, we swung the yards round,\neverything coming hard, and with a creaking and rending sound, like\npulling up a plank which had been frozen into the ice.  The ship\nwore round fairly, the yards were steadied, and we stood off on the\nother tack, leaving behind us, directly under our larboard quarter,\na large ice island, peering out of the mist, and reaching high above\nour tops, while astern; and on either side of the island, large tracts\nof field-ice were dimly seen, heaving and rolling in the sea.  We were\nnow safe, and standing to the northward; but, in a few minutes more,\nhad it not been for the sharp look-out of the watch, we should have\nbeen fairly upon the ice, and left our ship’s old bones adrift in\nthe Southern ocean.  After standing to the northward a few hours,\nwe wore ship, and the wind having hauled, we stood to the southward\nand eastward.  All night long, a bright lookout was kept from every\npart of the deck; and whenever ice was seen on the one bow or the\nother, the helm was shifted and the yards braced, and by quick\nworking of the ship she was kept clear.  The accustomed cry of\n\"Ice ahead!\"–\"Ice on the lee bow!\"–\"Another island!” in the\nsame tones, and with the same orders following them, seemed to\nbring us directly back to our old position of the week before.",
        "During our watch on deck, which was from twelve to four, the wind\ncame out ahead, with a pelting storm of hail and sleet, and we\nlay hove-to, under a close-reefed main topsail, the whole watch.\nDuring the next watch it fell calm, with a drenching rain, until\ndaybreak, when the wind came out to the westward, and the weather\ncleared up, and showed us the whole ocean, in the course which we\nshould have steered, had it not been for the head wind and calm,\ncompletely blocked up with ice.  Here then our progress was stopped,\nand we wore ship, and once more stood to the northward and eastward;\nnot for the straits of Magellan, but to make another attempt to\ndouble the Cape, still farther to the eastward; for the captain\nwas determined to get round if perseverance could do it; and the\nthird time, he said, never failed.",
        "With a fair wind we soon ran clear of the field-ice, and by noon\nhad only the stray islands floating far and near upon the ocean. ",
        "The sun was out bright, the sea of a deep blue, fringed with the\nwhite foam of the waves which ran high before a strong south-wester;\nour solitary ship tore on through the water, as though glad to be\nout of her confinement; and the ice islands lay scattered upon the\nocean here and there, of various sizes and shapes, reflecting the\nbright rays of the sun, and drifting slowly northward before the\ngale.  It was a contrast to much that we had lately seen, and a\nspectacle not only of beauty, but of life; for it required but\nlittle fancy to imagine these islands to be animate masses which\nhad broken loose from the “thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice,\"\nand were working their way, by wind and current, some alone,\nand some in fleets, to milder climes.  No pencil has ever yet\ngiven anything like the true effect of an iceberg.  In a picture,\nthey are huge, uncouth masses, stuck in the sea, while their chief\nbeauty and grandeur,–their slow, stately motion; the whirling\nof the snow about their summits, and the fearful groaning and\ncracking of their parts,–the picture cannot give.  This is the\nlarge iceberg; while the small and distant islands, floating on\nthe smooth sea, in the light of a clear day, look like little\nfloating fairy isles of sapphire.",
        "From a north-east course we gradually hauled to the eastward, and\nafter sailing about two hundred miles, which brought us as near to\nthe western coast of Terra del Fuego as was safe, and having lost\nsight of the ice altogether,–for the third time we put the ship’s\nhead to the southward, to try the passage of the Cape. The weather\ncontinued clear and cold, with a strong gale from the westward,\nand we were fast getting up with the latitude of the Cape, with a\nprospect of soon being round.  One fine afternoon, a man who had\ngone into the fore-top to shift the rolling tackles, sung out, at\nthe top of his voice, and with evident glee,–\"Sail ho!”  Neither\nland nor sail had we seen since leaving San Diego; and any one who\nhas traversed the length of a whole ocean alone, can imagine what\nan excitement such an announcement produced on board.  “Sail ho!\"\nshouted the cook, jumping out of his galley; “Sail ho!” shouted\na man, throwing back the slide of the scuttle, to the watch below,\nwho were soon out of their berths and on deck; and “Sail ho!\"\nshouted the captain down the companion-way to the passenger in\nthe cabin.  Besides the pleasure of seeing a ship and human beings\nin so desolate a place, it was important for us to speak a vessel,\nto learn whether there was ice to the eastward, and to ascertain the\nlongitude; for we had no chronometer, and had been drifting about\nso long that we had nearly lost our reckoning, and opportunities\nfor lunar observations are not frequent or sure in such a place as\nCape Horn.  For these various reasons, the excitement in our little\ncommunity was running high, and conjectures were made, and everything\nthought of for which the captain would hail, when the man aloft sung\nout–\"Another sail, large on the weather bow!”",
        "This was a little odd, but so much the better, and did not shake\nour faith in their being sails.  At length the man in the top\nhailed, and said he believed it was land, after all.  “Land in\nyour eye!” said the mate, who was looking through a telescope;\n\"they are ice islands, if I can see a hole through a ladder;” and a\nfew moments showed the mate to be right and all our expectations\nfled; and instead of what we most wished to see, we had what we\nmost dreaded, and what we hoped we had seen the last of.  We soon,\nhowever, left these astern, having passed within about two miles\nof them; and at sundown the horizon was clear in all directions.",
        "Having a fine wind, we were soon up with and passed the latitude\nof the Cape, and having stood far enough to the southward to give\nit a wide berth, we began to stand to the eastward, with a good\nprospect of being round and steering to the northward on the\nother side, in a very few days.",
        "But ill luck seemed to have lighted upon us.  Not four hours had\nwe been standing on in this course, before it fell dead calm;\nand in half an hour it clouded up; a few straggling blasts,\nwith spits of snow and sleet, came from the eastward; and in\nan hour more, we lay hove-to under a close-reefed main topsail,\ndrifting bodily off to leeward before the fiercest storm that we\nhad yet felt, blowing dead ahead, from the eastward.  It seemed\nas though the genius of the place had been roused at finding that\nwe had nearly slipped through his fingers, and had come down upon\nus with tenfold fury.  The sailors said that every blast, as it\nshook the shrouds, and whistled through the rigging, said to the\nold ship, “No, you don’t!\"–\"No, you don’t!”",
        "For eight days we lay drifting about in this manner.  Sometimes,–\ngenerally towards noon,–it fell calm; once or twice a round copper\nball showed itself for a few moments in the place where the sun ought\nto have been; and a puff or two came from the westward, giving some\nhope that a fair wind had come at last.  During the first two days,\nwe made sail for these puffs, shaking the reefs out of the topsails\nand boarding the tacks of the courses; but finding that it only made\nwork for us when the gale set in again, it was soon given up, and we\nlay-to under our close-reefs.",
        "We had less snow and hail than when we were farther to the westward,\nbut we had an abundance of what is worse to a sailor in cold\nweather–drenching rain.  Snow is blinding, and very bad when\ncoming upon a coast, but, for genuine discomfort, give me rain\nwith freezing weather.  A snow-storm is exciting, and it does not\nwet through the clothes (which is important to a sailor); but a\nconstant rain there is no escaping from.  It wets to the skin,\nand makes all protection vain.  We had long ago run through all\nour dry clothes, and as sailors have no other way of drying them\nthan by the sun, we had nothing to do but to put on those which\nwere the least wet.",
        "At the end of each watch, when we came below, we took off our clothes\nand wrung them out; two taking hold of a pair of trowsers,–one\nat each end,–and jackets in the same way.  Stockings, mittens,\nand all, were wrung out also and then hung up to drain and chafe\ndry against the bulk-heads.  Then, feeling of all our clothes,\nwe picked out those which were the least wet, and put them on,\nso as to be ready for a call, and turned-in, covered ourselves\nup with blankets, and slept until three knocks on the scuttle\nand the dismal sound of “All starbowlines ahoy!  Eight bells,\nthere below!  Do you hear the news?” drawled out from on deck,\nand the sulky answer of “Aye, aye!” from below, sent us up again.",
        "On deck, all was as dark as a pocket, and either a dead calm,\nwith the rain pouring steadily down, or, more generally, a violent\ngale dead ahead, with rain pelting horizontally, and occasional\nvariations of hail and sleet;–decks afloat with water swashing\nfrom side to side, and constantly wet feet; for boots could not\nbe wrung out like drawers, and no composition could stand the\nconstant soaking.  In fact, wet and cold feet are inevitable\nin such weather, and are not the least of those little items\nwhich go to make up the grand total of the discomforts of a winter\npassage round the Cape.  Few words were spoken between the watches\nas they shifted, the wheel was relieved, the mate took his place\non the quarter-deck, the look-outs in the bows; and each man had\nhis narrow space to walk fore and aft in, or, rather, to swing\nhimself forward and back in, from one belaying pin to another,–\nfor the decks were too slippery with ice and water to allow of\nmuch walking.  To make a walk, which is absolutely necessary to\npass away the time, one of us hit upon the expedient of sanding\nthe deck; and afterwards, whenever the rain was not so violent\nas to wash it off, the weatherside of the quarter-deck and a part\nof the waist and forecastle were sprinkled with the sand which we\nhad on board for holystoning; and thus we made a good promenade,\nwhere we walked fore and aft, two and two, hour after hour, in our\nlong, dull, and comfortless watches.  The bells seemed to be an\nhour or two apart, instead of half an hour, and an age to elapse\nbefore the welcome sound of eight bells.  The sole object was to\nmake the time pass on.  Any change was sought for, which would\nbreak the monotony of the time; and even the two hours’ trick at\nthe wheel, which came round to each of us, in turn, once in every\nother watch, was looked upon as a relief.  Even the never-failing\nresource of long yarns, which eke out many a watch, seemed to have\nfailed us now; for we had been so long together that we had heard\neach other’s stories told over and over again, till we had them\nby heart; each one knew the whole history of each of the others,\nand we were fairly and literally talked out.  Singing and joking,\nwe were in no humor for, and, in fact, any sound of mirth or laughter\nwould have struck strangely upon our ears, and would not have been\ntolerated, any more than whistling, or a wind instrument.  The last\nresort, that of speculating upon the future, seemed now to fail us,\nfor our discouraging situation, and the danger we were really in,\n(as we expected every day to find ourselves drifted back among the\nice) “clapped a stopper” upon all that.  From saying–\"when we get\nhome\"–we began insensibly to alter it to–\"if we get home\"–and at\nlast the subject was dropped by a tacit consent.",
        "In this state of things, a new light was struck out, and a new\nfield opened, by a change in the watch.  One of our watch was\nlaid up for two or three days by a bad hand, (for in cold weather\nthe least cut or bruise ripens into a sore,) and his place was\nsupplied by the carpenter.  This was a windfall, and there was\nquite a contest, who should have the carpenter to walk with him.\nAs “Chips” was a man of some little education, and he and I had\nhad a good deal of intercourse with each other, he fell in with\nme in my walk.  He was a Fin, but spoke English very well, and\ngave me long accounts of his country;–the customs, the trade,\nthe towns, what little he knew of the government, (I found he was\nno friend of Russia), his voyages, his first arrival in America,\nhis marriage and courtship;–he had married a countrywoman of his,\na dress-maker, whom he met with in Boston.  I had very little to\ntell him of my quiet, sedentary life at home; and, in spite of\nour best efforts, which had protracted these yarns through five\nor six watches, we fairly talked one another out, and I turned\nhim over to another man in the watch, and put myself upon my\nown resources.",
        "I commenced a deliberate system of time-killing, which united\nsome profit with a cheering up of the heavy hours.  As soon\nas I came on deck, and took my place and regular walk, I began\nwith repeating over to myself a string of matters which I had\nin my memory, in regular order.  First, the multiplication table\nand the tables of weights and measures; then the states of the\nunion, with their capitals; the counties of England, with their\nshire towns; the kings of England in their order; and a large\npart of the peerage, which I committed from an almanac that we\nhad on board; and then the Kanaka numerals.  This carried me\nthrough my facts, and, being repeated deliberately, with long\nintervals, often eked out the two first bells.  Then came the\nten commandments; the thirty-ninth chapter of Job, and a few\nother passages from Scripture.  The next in the order, that I\nnever varied from, came Cowper’s Castaway, which was a great\nfavorite with me; the solemn measure and gloomy character of\nwhich, as well as the incident that it was founded upon, made it\nwell suited to a lonely watch at sea.  Then his lines to Mary,\nhis address to the jackdaw, and a short extract from Table Talk;\n(I abounded in Cowper, for I happened to have a volume of his\npoems in my chest;) “Ille et nefasto” from Horace, and Goethe’s\nErl King.  After I had got through these, I allowed myself a more\ngeneral range among everything that I could remember, both in prose\nand verse.  In this way, with an occasional break by relieving the\nwheel, heaving the log, and going to the scuttle-butt for a drink\nof water, the longest watch was passed away; and I was so regular\nin my silent recitations, that if there was no interruption by\nship’s duty, I could tell very nearly the number of bells by my\nprogress.",
        "Our watches below were no more varied than the watch on deck. ",
        "All washing, sewing, and reading was given up; and we did nothing\nbut eat, sleep, and stand our watch, leading what might be called a\nCape Horn life.  The forecastle was too uncomfortable to sit up in;\nand whenever we were below, we were in our berths.  To prevent the\nrain, and the sea-water which broke over the bows, from washing down,\nwe were obliged to keep the scuttle closed, so that the forecastle\nwas nearly air-tight.  In this little, wet, leaky hole, we were all\nquartered, in an atmosphere so bad that our lamp, which swung in\nthe middle from the beams, sometimes actually burned blue, with a\nlarge circle of foul air about it.  Still I was never in better\nhealth than after three weeks of this life.  I gained a great\ndeal of flesh, and we all ate like horses.  At every watch, when we\ncame below, before turning-in, the bread barge and beef kid were\noverhauled.  Each man drank his quart of hot tea night and morning;\nand glad enough we were to get it, for no nectar and ambrosia were\nsweeter to the lazy immortals, than was a pot of hot tea, a hard\nbiscuit, and a slice of cold salt beef, to us after a watch on\ndeck.  To be sure, we were mere animals and had this life lasted\na year instead of a month we should have been little better than\nthe ropes in the ship.  Not a razor, nor a brush, nor a drop\nof water, except the rain and the spray, had come near us all\nthe time; for we were on an allowance of fresh water; and who\nwould strip and wash himself in salt water on deck, in the snow\nand ice, with the thermometer at zero?",
        "After about eight days of constant easterly gales, the wind\nhauled occasionally a little to the southward, and blew hard,\nwhich, as we were well to the southward, allowed us to brace\nin a little and stand on, under all the sail we could carry.\nThese turns lasted but a short while, and sooner or later it set\nagain from the old quarter; yet each time we made something,\nand were gradually edging along to the eastward.  One night,\nafter one of these shifts of the wind, and when all hands had been\nup a great part of the time, our watch was left on deck, with the\nmainsail hanging in the buntlines, ready to be set if necessary.\nIt came on to blow worse and worse, with hail and snow beating\nlike so many furies upon the ship, it being as dark and thick as\nnight could make it.  The mainsail was blowing and slatting with\na noise like thunder, when the captain came on deck, and ordered\nit to be furled.  The mate was about to call all hands, when the\ncaptain stopped him, and said that the men would be beaten out if\nthey were called up so often; that as our watch must stay on deck,\nit might as well be doing that as anything else.",
        "Accordingly, we went upon the yard; and never shall I forget\nthat piece of work.  Our watch had been so reduced by sickness,\nand by some having been left in California, that, with one man\nat the wheel, we had only the third mate and three beside myself,\nto go aloft; so that at most, we could only attempt to furl one\nyard-arm at a time.  We manned the weather yard-arm, and set to\nwork to make a furl of it.  Our lower masts being short, and our\nyards very square, the sail had a head of nearly fifty feet,\nand a short leach, made still shorter by the deep reef which\nwas in it, which brought the clew away out on the quarters of\nthe yard, and made a bunt nearly as square as the mizen royal-\nyard.  Beside this difficulty, the yard over which we lay was\ncased with ice, the gaskets and rope of the foot and leach of\nthe sail as stiff and hard as a piece of suction-hose, and the\nsail itself about as pliable as though it had been made of sheets\nof sheathing copper.  It blew a perfect hurricane, with alternate\nblasts of snow, hail, and rain.  We had to fist the sail with\nbare hands.  No one could trust himself to mittens, for if he\nslipped, he was a gone man.  All the boats were hoisted in on\ndeck, and there was nothing to be lowered for him.  We had need\nof every finger God had given us.  Several times we got the sail\nupon the yard, but it blew away again before we could secure it.\nIt required men to lie over the yard to pass each turn of the\ngaskets, and when they were passed, it was almost impossible to\nknot them so that they would hold.  Frequently we were obliged to\nleave off altogether and take to beating our hands upon the sail,\nto keep them from freezing.",
        "After some time,–which seemed forever,–we got the weather side\nstowed after a fashion, and went over to leeward for another trial. ",
        "This was still worse, for the body of the sail had been blown over\nto leeward, and as the yard was a-cock-bill by the lying over of\nthe vessel, we had to light it all up to windward.  When the yard-\narms were furled, the bunt was all adrift again, which made more\nwork for us.  We got all secure at last, but we had been nearly\nan hour and a half upon the yard, and it seemed an age.  It just\nstruck five bells when we went up, and eight were struck soon after\nwe came down.  This may seem slow work, but considering the state\nof everything, and that we had only five men to a sail with just\nhalf as many square yards of canvas in it as the mainsail of the\nIndependence, sixty-gun ship, which musters seven hundred men at\nher quarters, it is not wonderful that we were no quicker about it.\nWe were glad enough to get on deck, and still more, to go below.\nThe oldest sailor in the watch said, as he went down,–\"I shall\nnever forget that main yard;–it beats all my going a fishing.\nFun is fun, but furling one yard-arm of a course, at a time,\noff Cape Horn, is no better than man-killing.”",
        "During the greater part of the next two days, the wind was pretty\nsteady from the southward.  We had evidently made great progress,\nand had good hope of being soon up with the Cape, if we were not\nthere already.  We could put but little confidence in our reckoning,\nas there had been no opportunities for an observation, and we had\ndrifted too much to allow of our dead reckoning being anywhere\nnear the mark.  If it would clear off enough to give a chance for\nan observation, or if we could make land, we should know where we\nwere; and upon these, and the chances of falling in with a sail\nfrom the eastward, we depended almost entirely.",
        "Friday, July 22d.  This day we had a steady gale from the southward,\nand stood on under close sail, with the yards eased a little by the\nweather braces, the clouds lifting a little, and showing signs of\nbreaking away.  In the afternoon, I was below with Mr. H––-,\nthe third mate, and two others, filling the bread locker in the\nsteerage from the casks, when a bright gleam of sunshine broke\nout and shone down the companion-way and through the skylight,\nlighting up everything below, and sending a warm glow through the\nheart of every one.  It was a sight we had not seen for weeks,–an\nomen, a god-send.  Even the roughest and hardest face acknowledged\nits influence.  Just at that moment we heard a loud shout from all\nparts of the deck, and the mate called out down the companion-way to\nthe captain, who was sitting in the cabin.  What he said, we could\nnot distinguish, but the captain kicked over his chair, and was on\ndeck at one jump.  We could not tell what it was; and, anxious as\nwe were to know, the discipline of the ship would not allow of our\nleaving our places.  Yet, as we were not called, we knew there was\nno danger.  We hurried to get through with our job, when, seeing the\nsteward’s black face peering out of the pantry, Mr. H––- hailed\nhim, to know what was the matter.  “Lan’ o, to be sure, sir!  No\nyou hear ’em sing out, ’Lan’ o?’  De cap’em say ’im Cape Horn!”",
        "This gave us a new start, and we were soon through our work,\nand on deck; and there lay the land, fair upon the larboard\nbeam, and slowly edging away upon the quarter.  All hands were\nbusy looking at it–the captain and mates from the quarter-deck,\nthe cook from his galley, and the sailors from the forecastle;\nand even Mr. N., the passenger, who had kept in his shell for\nnearly a month, and hardly been seen by anybody, and who we had\nalmost forgotten was on board, came out like a butterfly, and was\nhopping round as bright as a bird.",
        "The land was the island of Staten Land, and, just to the eastward\nof Cape Horn; and a more desolate-looking spot I never wish to set\neyes upon;–bare, broken, and girt with rocks and ice, with here\nand there, between the rocks and broken hillocks, a little stunted\nvegetation of shrubs.  It was a place well suited to stand at the\njunction of the two oceans, beyond the reach of human cultivation,\nand encounter the blasts and snows of a perpetual winter.  Yet,\ndismal as it was, it was a pleasant sight to us; not only as being\nthe first land we had seen, but because it told us that we had\npassed the Cape,–were in the Atlantic,–and that, with twenty-\nfour hours of this breeze, might bid defiance to the Southern\nOcean.  It told us, too, our latitude and longitude better than\nany observation; and the captain now knew where we were, as well\nas if we were off the end of Long wharf.",
        "In the general joy, Mr. N. said he should like to go ashore upon\nthe island and examine a spot which probably no human being had\never set foot upon; but the captain intimated that he would see the\nisland–specimens and all,–in–another place, before he would get\nout a boat or delay the ship one moment for him. ",
        "We left the land gradually astern; and at sundown had the\nAtlantic Ocean clear before us.",
        "It is usual, in voyages round the Cape from the Pacific, to keep\nto the eastward of the Falkland Islands; but as it had now set in\na strong, steady, and clear south-wester, with every prospect of\nits lasting, and we had had enough of high latitudes, the captain\ndetermined to stand immediately to the northward, running inside\nthe Falkland Islands.  Accordingly, when the wheel was relieved at\neight o’clock, the order was given to keep her due north, and all\nhands were turned up to square away the yards and make sail.\nIn a moment, the news ran through the ship that the captain was\nkeeping her off, with her nose straight for Boston, and Cape Horn\nover her taffrail.  It was a moment of enthusiasm.  Every one was\non the alert, and even the two sick men turned out to lend a hand\nat the halyards.  The wind was now due south-west, and blowing\na gale to which a vessel close hauled could have shown no more\nthan a single close-reefed sail; but as we were going before it,\nwe could carry on.",
        "Accordingly, hands were sent aloft, and a reef shaken out of the\ntop-sails, and the reefed foresail set.  When we came to masthead\nthe topsail yards, with all hands at the halyards, we struck up\n\"Cheerily, men,” with a chorus which might have been heard half-way\nto Staten Land.  Under her increased sail, the ship drove on through\nthe water.  Yet she could bear it well; and the captain sang out from\nthe quarter-deck–\"Another reef out of that fore-topsail, and give\nit to her!”  Two hands sprang aloft; the frozen reef-points and\nearings were cast adrift, the halyards manned, and the sail gave\nout her increased canvas to the gale.  All hands were kept on\ndeck to watch the effect of the change.  It was as much as she\ncould well carry, and with a heavy sea astern, it took two men\nat the wheel to steer her.  She flung the foam from her bows;\nthe spray breaking aft as far as the gangway.  She was going at\na prodigious rate.",
        "Still, everything held.  Preventer braces were reeved and hauled\ntaught; tackles got upon the backstays; and each thing done to\nkeep all snug and strong.  The captain walked the deck at a rapid\nstride, looked aloft at the sails, and then to windward; the mate\nstood in the gangway, rubbing his hands, and talking aloud to the\nship–\"Hurrah, old bucket! the Boston girls have got hold of the\ntow-rope!” and the like; and we were on the forecastle, looking\nto see how the spars stood it, and guessing the rate at which\nshe was going,–when the captain called out–\"Mr. Brown, get up\nthe topmast studding-sail!  What she can’t carry she may drag!\"\nThe mate looked a moment; but he would let no one be before him\nin daring.",
        "He sprang forward–\"Hurrah, men! rig out the topmast studding-sail\nboom!  Lay aloft, and I’ll send the rigging up to you!\"–We sprang\naloft into the top; lowered a girt-line down, by which we hauled\nup the rigging; rove the tacks and halyards; ran out the boom and\nlashed it fast, and sent down the lower halyards, as a preventer.\nIt was a clear starlight night, cold and blowing; but everybody\nworked with a will.  Some, indeed, looked as though they thought\nthe “old man” was mad, but no one said a word.  We had had a new\ntopmast studding-sail made with a reef in it,–a thing hardly\never heard of, and which the sailors had ridiculed a good deal,\nsaying that when it was time to reef a studding-sail, it was time\nto take it in.  But we found a use for it now; for, there being\na reef in the topsail, the studding-sail could not be set without\none in it also.  To be sure, a studding-sail with reefed topsails\nwas rather a new thing; yet there was some reason in it, for if\nwe carried that away, we should lose only a sail and a boom;\nbut a whole topsail might have carried away the mast and all.",
        "While we were aloft, the sail had been got out, bent to the yard,\nreefed, and ready for hoisting.  Waiting for a good opportunity,\nthe halyards were manned and the yard hoisted fairly up to the\nblock; but when the mate came to shake the catspaw out of the\ndownhaul, and we began to boom-end the sail, it shook the ship\nto her centre.  The boom buckled up and bent like a whip-stick,\nand we looked every moment to see something go; but, being of\nthe short, tough upland spruce, it bent like whalebone, and nothing\ncould break it.  The carpenter said it was the best stick he had\never seen.  The strength of all hands soon brought the tack to\nthe boom-end, and the sheet was trimmed down, and the preventer\nand the weather brace hauled taught to take off the strain.\nEvery rope-yarn seemed stretched to the utmost, and every thread\nof canvas; and with this sail added to her, the ship sprang through\nthe water like a thing possessed.  The sail being nearly all forward,\nit lifted her out of the water, and she seemed actually to jump from\nsea to sea.  From the time her keel was laid, she had never been so\ndriven; and had it been life or death with every one of us, she could\nnot have borne another stitch of canvas.",
        "Finding that she would bear the sail, the hands were sent below,\nand our watch remained on deck.  Two men at the wheel had as much\nas they could do to keep her within three points of her course,\nfor she steered as wild as a young colt.  The mate walked the deck,\nlooking at the sails, and then over the side to see the foam fly\nby her, slapping his hands upon his thighs and talking to the\nship–\"Hurrah, you jade, you’ve got the scent!–you know where\nyou’re going!”  And when she leaped over the seas, and almost\nout of the water, and trembled to her very keel, the spars\nand masts snapping and creaking,–\"There she goes!–There she\ngoes,–handsomely!–as long as she cracks she holds!\"–while we\nstood with the rigging laid down fair for letting go, and ready\nto take in sail and clear away, if anything went.  At four bells\nwe hove the log, and she was going eleven knots fairly; and had it\nnot been for the sea from aft which sent the ship home, and threw\nher continually off her course, the log would have shown her to\nhave been going much faster.  I went to the wheel with a young\nfellow from the Kennebec, who was a good helmsman; and for two\nhours we had our hands full.  A few minutes showed us that our\nmonkey-jackets must come off; and, cold as it was, we stood in\nour shirt-sleeves, in a perspiration; and were glad enough to have\nit eight bells, and the wheel relieved.  We turned-in and slept\nas well as we could, though the sea made a constant roar under\nher bows, and washed over the forecastle like a small cataract.",
        "At four o’clock, we were called again.  The same sail was still on\nthe vessel, and the gale, if there was any change, had increased\na little.  No attempt was made to take the studding-sail in;\nand, indeed, it was too late now.  If we had started anything\ntoward taking it in, either tack or halyards, it would have blown\nto pieces, and carried something away with it.  The only way now was\nto let everything stand, and if the gale went down, well and good;\nif not, something must go–the weakest stick or rope first–and\nthen we could get it in.  For more than an hour she was driven on\nat such a rate that she seemed actually to crowd the sea into a\nheap before her; and the water poured over the spritsail yard as\nit would over a dam.  Toward daybreak the gale abated a little,\nand she was just beginning to go more easily along, relieved of\nthe pressure, when Mr. Brown, determined to give her no respite,\nand depending upon the wind’s subsiding as the sun rose, told us\nto get along the lower studding-sail.  This was an immense sail,\nand held wind enough to last a Dutchman a week,–hove-to.  It was\nsoon ready, the boom topped up, preventer guys rove, and the idlers\ncalled up to man the halyards; yet such was still the force of the\ngale, that we were nearly an hour setting the sail; carried away the\nouthaul in doing it, and came very near snapping off the swinging\nboom.  No sooner was it set than the ship tore on again like one\nthat was mad, and began to steer as wild as a hawk.  The men at\nthe wheel were puffing and blowing at their work, and the helm was\ngoing hard up and hard down, constantly.  Add to this, the gale\ndid not lessen as the day came on, but the sun rose in clouds.\nA sudden lurch threw the man from the weather wheel across the deck\nand against the side.  The mate sprang to the wheel, and the man,\nregaining his feet, seized the spokes, and they hove the wheel up\njust in time to save her from broaching to; though nearly half\nthe studding-sail went under water; and as she came to, the boom\nstood up at an angle of forty five degrees.  She had evidently\nmore on her than she could bear; yet it was in vain to try to\ntake it in–the clewline was not strong enough; and they were\nthinking of cutting away, when another wide yaw and a come-to,\nsnapped the guys, and the swinging boom came in, with a crash,\nagainst the lower rigging.  The outhaul block gave way, and the\ntopmast studding-sail boom bent in a manner which I never before\nsupposed a stick could bend.  I had my eye on it when the guys\nparted, and it made one spring and buckled up so as to form nearly\na half circle, and sprang out again to its shape.",
        "The clewline gave way at the first pull; the cleat to which the\nhalyards were belayed was wrenched off, and the sail blew round\nthe spritsail yards and head guys, which gave us a bad job to\nget it in.",
        "A half hour served to clear all away, and she was suffered to drive\non with her topmast studding-sail set, it being as much as she could\nstagger under. ",
        "During all this day and the next night, we went on under the same\nsail, the gale blowing with undiminished force; two men at the wheel\nall the time; watch and watch, and nothing to do but to steer and\nlook out for the ship, and be blown along;–until the noon of the\nnext day–",
        "Sunday, July 24th, when we were in latitude 50° 27’ S., longitude\n62° 13’ W., having made four degrees of latitude in the last\ntwenty-four hours.  Being now to northward of the Falkland Islands,\nthe ship was kept off, north-east, for the equator; and with her\nhead for the equator, and Cape Horn over her taffrail, she went\ngloriously on; every heave of the sea leaving the Cape astern,\nand every hour bringing us nearer to home, and to warm weather.\nMany a time, when blocked up in the ice, with everything dismal\nand discouraging about us, had we said,–if we were only fairly\nround, and standing north on the other side, we should ask for\nno more:–and now we had it all, with a clear sea, and as much\nwind as a sailor could pray for.  If the best part of the voyage\nis the last part, surely we had all now that we could wish.\nEvery one was in the highest spirits, and the ship seemed as\nglad as any of us at getting out of her confinement.  At each\nchange of the watch, those coming on deck asked those going\nbelow–\"How does she go along?” and got for answer, the rate,\nand the customary addition–\"Aye! and the Boston girls have had hold\nof the tow-rope all the watch, and can’t haul half the slack in!\"\nEach day the sun rose higher in the horizon, and the nights grew\nshorter; and at coming on deck each morning, there was a sensible\nchange in the temperature.  The ice, too, began to melt from off\nthe rigging and spars, and, except a little which remained in the\ntops and round the hounds of the lower masts, was soon gone.  As we\nleft the gale behind us, the reefs were shaken out of the topsails,\nand sail made as fast as she could bear it; and every time all hands\nwere sent to the halyards, a song was called for, and we hoisted\naway with a will.",
        "Sail after sail was added, as we drew into fine weather; and in\none week after leaving Cape Horn, the long topgallant masts were\ngot up, topgallant and royal yards crossed, and the ship restored\nto her fair proportions.",
        "The Southern Cross we saw no more after the first night; the\nMagellan Clouds settled lower and lower in the horizon; and so\ngreat was our change of latitude each succeeding night, that we\nsank some constellation in the south, and raised another in the\nnorthern horizon.",
        "Sunday, July 31st.  At noon we were in lat. 36° 41’ S., long.\n38° 08’ W.; having traversed the distance of two thousand miles,\nallowing for changes of course, in nine days.  A thousand miles\nin four days and a half!–This is equal to steam.",
        "Soon after eight o’clock, the appearance of the ship gave evidence\nthat this was the first Sunday we had yet had in fine weather.\nAs the sun came up clear, with the promise of a fair, warm day,\nand, as usual on Sunday, there was no work going on, all hands\nturned-to upon clearing out the forecastle.  The wet and soiled\nclothes which had accumulated there during the past month, were\nbrought up on deck; the chests moved; brooms, buckets of water,\nswabs, scrubbing-brushes, and scrapers carried down, and applied,\nuntil the forecastle floor was as white as chalk, and everything\nneat and in order.  The bedding from the berths was then spread on\ndeck, and dried, and aired; the deck-tub filled with water; and a\ngrand washing begun of all the clothes which were brought up.\nShirts, frocks, drawers, trowsers, jackets, stockings, of every\nshape and color, wet and dirty–many of them mouldy from having\nbeen lying a long time wet in a foul corner–these were all washed\nand scrubbed out, and finally towed overboard for half an hour;\nand then made fast in the rigging to dry.  Wet boots and shoes\nwere spread out to dry in sunny places on deck; and the whole\nship looked like a back yard on a washing day.  After we had\ndone with our clothes, we began upon our own persons.  A little\nfresh water, which we had saved from our allowance, was put in\nbuckets, and with soap and towels, we had what sailors call\na fresh-water wash.  The same bucket, to be sure, had to go\nthrough several hands, and was spoken for by one after another,\nbut as we rinsed off in salt water, pure from the ocean, and the\nfresh was used only to start the accumulated grime and blackness\nof five weeks, it was held of little consequence.",
        "We soaped down and scrubbed one another with towels and pieces\nof canvas, stripping to it; and then, getting into the head,\nthrew buckets of water upon each other.  After this, came shaving,\nand combing, and brushing; and when, having spent the first part of\nthe day in this way, we sat down on the forecastle, in the afternoon,\nwith clean duck trowsers, and shirts on, washed, shaved, and combed,\nand looking a dozen shades lighter for it, reading, sewing, and\ntalking at our ease, with a clear sky and warm sun over our heads,\na steady breeze over the larboard quarter, studding-sails out alow\nand aloft, and all the flying kites aboard;–we felt that we had\ngot back into the pleasantest part of a sailor’s life.  At sundown\nthe clothes were all taken down from the rigging–clean and dry–and\nstowed neatly away in our chests; and our southwesters, thick boots,\nguernsey frocks, and other accompaniments of bad weather, put out\nof the way, we hoped, for the rest of the voyage, as we expected\nto come upon the coast early in the autumn.",
        "Notwithstanding all that has been said about the beauty of a\nship under full sail, there are very few who have ever seen\na ship, literally, under all her sail.  A ship coming in or\ngoing out of port, with her ordinary sails, and perhaps two of\nthree studding-sails, is commonly said to be under full sail;\nbut a ship never has all her sail upon her, except when she has\na light, steady breeze, very nearly, but not quite, dead aft,\nand so regular that it can be trusted, and is likely to last\nfor some time.  Then, with all her sails, light and heavy, and\nstudding-sails, on each side, alow and aloft, she is the most\nglorious moving object in the world.  Such a sight, very few,\neven some who have been at sea a great deal, have ever beheld;\nfor from the deck of your own vessel you cannot see her, as you\nwould a separate object.",
        "One night, while we were in these tropics, I went out to the end\nof the flying-jib-boom, upon some duty, and, having finished it,\nturned round, and lay over the boom for a long time, admiring the\nbeauty of the sight before me.  Being so far out from the deck,\nI could look at the ship, as at a separate vessel;–and there rose\nup from the water, supported only by the small black hull, a pyramid\nof canvas, spreading out far beyond the hull, and towering up almost,\nas it seemed in the indistinct night air, to the clouds.  The sea\nwas as still as an inland lake; the light trade-wind was gently and\nsteadily breathing from astern; the dark blue sky was studded with\nthe tropical stars; there was no sound but the rippling of the water\nunder the stem; and the sails were spread out, wide and high;–the\ntwo lower studding-sails stretching, on each side, far beyond the deck;\nthe topmast studding-sails, like wings to the topsails; the top-gallant\nstudding-sails spreading fearlessly out above them; still higher,\nthe two royal studding-sails, looking like two kites flying from\nthe same string; and, highest of all, the little skysail, the apex\nof the pyramid, seeming actually to touch the stars, and to be\nout of reach of human hand.  So quiet, too, was the sea, and so\nsteady the breeze, that if these sails had been sculptured marble,\nthey could not have been more motionless.  Not a ripple upon the\nsurface of the canvas; not even a quivering of the extreme edges\nof the sail–so perfectly were they distended by the breeze.\nI was so lost in the sight, that I forgot the presence of the\nman who came out with me, until he said, (for he, too, rough old\nman-of-war’s-man as he was, had been gazing at the show,) half to\nhimself, still looking at the marble sails–\"How quietly they do\ntheir work!”",
        "The fine weather brought work with it; as the ship was to be put in\norder for coming into port.  This may give a landsman some notion\nof what is done on board ship.–All the first part of a passage is\nspent in getting a ship ready for sea, and the last part in getting\nher ready for port.  She is, as sailors say, like a lady’s watch,\nalways out of repair.  The new, strong sails, which we had up off\nCape Horn, were to be sent down, and the old set, which were still\nserviceable in fine weather, to be bent in their place; all the\nrigging to be set up, fore and aft; the masts stayed; the standing\nrigging to be tarred down; lower and topmast rigging rattled down,\nfore and aft; the ship scraped, inside and out, and painted;\ndecks varnished; new and neat knots, seizings and coverings\nto be fitted; and every part put in order, to look well to the\nowner’s eye, on coming into Boston.  This, of course, was a long\nmatter; and all hands were kept on deck at work for the whole of\neach day, during the rest of the voyage.  Sailors call this hard\nusage; but the ship must be in crack order, and “we’re homeward\nbound” was the answer to everything.",
        "We went on for several days, employed in this way, nothing remarkable\noccurring; and, at the latter part of the week, fell in with the\nsouth-east trades, blowing about east-south-east, which brought\nthem nearly two points abaft our beam.  These blew strong and\nsteady, so that we hardly started a rope, until we were beyond\ntheir latitude.  The first day of “all hands,” one of those little\nincidents occurred, which are nothing in themselves, but are great\nmatters in the eyes of a ship’s company, as they serve to break the\nmonotony of a voyage, and afford conversation to the crew for days\nafterwards.  These small matters, too, are often interesting, as they\nshow the customs and state of feeling on shipboard.",
        "In merchant vessels, the captain gives his orders as to the ship’s\nwork, to the mate, in a general way, and leaves the execution of\nthem, with the particular ordering, to him.  This has become so fixed\na custom, that it is like a law, and is never infringed upon by a wise\nmaster, unless his mate is no seaman; in which case, the captain must\noften oversee things for himself.  This, however, could not be said\nof our chief mate; and he was very jealous of any encroachment upon\nthe borders of his authority.",
        "On Monday morning, the captain told him to stay the fore-topmast\nplumb.  He accordingly came forward, turned all hands to, with\ntackles on the stays and back-stays, coming up with the seizings,\nhauling here, belaying there, and full of business, standing between\nthe knightheads to sight the mast,–when the captain came forward,\nand also began to give orders.  This made confusion, and the mate,\nfinding that he was all aback, left his place and went aft, saying to\nthe captain–",
        "“If you come forward, sir, I’ll go aft.  One is enough on the forecastle.” ",
        "This produced a reply, and another fierce answer; and the words flew,\nfists were doubled up, and things looked threateningly. ",
        "“I’m master of this ship.” ",
        "“Yes, sir, and I’m mate of her, and know my place!  My place is\nforward, and yours is aft!” ",
        "“My place is where I choose!  I command the whole ship; and you\nare mate only so long as I choose!” ",
        "“Say the word, Capt. T., and I’m done!  I can do a man’s work\naboard!  I didn’t come through the cabin windows!  If I’m not\nmate, I can be man,” etc., etc.",
        "This was all fun for us, who stood by, winking at each other, and\nenjoying the contest between the higher powers.  The captain took\nthe mate aft; and they had a long talk, which ended in the mate’s\nreturning to his duty.  The captain had broken through a custom,\nwhich is a part of the common-law of a ship, and without reason;\nfor he knew that his mate was a sailor, and needed no help from him;\nand the mate was excusable for being angry.  Yet he was wrong, and\nthe captain right.  Whatever the captain does is right, ipso facto,\nand any opposition to it is wrong, on board ship; and every officer\nand man knows this when he signs the ship’s articles.",
        "It is a part of the contract.  Yet there has grown up in merchant\nvessels a series of customs, which have become a well understood\nsystem, and have almost the force of prescriptive law.  To be sure,\nall power is in the captain, and the officers hold their authority\nonly during his will; and the men are liable to be called upon for\nany service; yet, by breaking in upon these usages, many difficulties\nhave occurred on board ship, and even come into courts of justice,\nwhich are perfectly unintelligible to any one not acquainted with the\nuniversal nature and force of these customs.  Many a provocation has\nbeen offered, and a system of petty oppression pursued towards men,\nthe force and meaning of which would appear as nothing to strangers,\nand doubtless do appear so to many “’long-shore” juries and judges.",
        "The next little diversion, was a battle on the forecastle one\nafternoon, between the mate and the steward.  They had been on\nbad terms the whole voyage; and had threatened a rupture several\ntimes.  This afternoon, the mate asked him for a tumbler of water,\nand he refused to get it for him, saying that he waited upon\nnobody but the captain: and here he had the custom on his side.\nBut in answering, he left off “the handle to the mate’s name.\"\nThis enraged the mate, who called him a “black soger;” and at it\nthey went, clenching, striking, and rolling over and over; while\nwe stood by, looking on, and enjoying the fun.  The darky tried\nto butt him, but the mate got him down, and held him, the steward\nsinging out, “Let me go, Mr. Brown, or there’ll be blood spilt!\"\nIn the midst of this, the captain came on deck, separated them,\ntook the steward aft, and gave him half a dozen with a rope’s end.",
        "The steward tried to justify himself; but he had been heard to talk\nof spilling blood, and that was enough to earn him his flogging;\nand the captain did not choose to inquire any further.",
        "The same day, I met with one of those narrow escapes, which are\nso often happening in a sailor’s life.  I had been aloft nearly\nall the afternoon, at work, standing for as much as an hour on\nthe fore top-gallant yard, which was hoisted up, and hung only by\nthe tie; when, having got through my work, I balled up my yarns,\ntook my serving-board in my hand, laid hold deliberately of the\ntop-gallant rigging, took one foot from the yard, and was just\nlifting the other, when the tie parted, and down the yard fell.\nI was safe, by my hold upon the rigging, but it made my heart beat\nquick.  Had the tie parted one instant sooner, or had I stood an\ninstant longer on the yard, I should inevitably have been thrown\nviolently from the height of ninety or a hundred feet, overboard;\nor, what is worse, upon the deck.  However, “a miss is as good\nas a mile;” a saying which sailors very often have occasion to\nuse.  An escape is always a joke on board ship.  A man would be\nridiculed who should make a serious matter of it.  A sailor knows\ntoo well that his life hangs upon a thread, to wish to be always\nreminded of it; so, if a man has an escape, he keeps it to himself,\nor makes a joke of it.  I have often known a man’s life to be saved\nby an instant of time, or by the merest chance,–the swinging of\na rope,–and no notice taken of it.  One of our boys, when off\nCape Horn, reefing topsails of a dark night, and when there were\nno boats to be lowered away, and where, if a man fell overboard he\nmust be left behind,–lost his hold of the reef-point, slipped from\nthe foot-rope, and would have been in the water in a moment, when\nthe man who was next to him on the yard caught him by the collar\nof his jacket, and hauled him up upon the yard, with–\"Hold on,\nanother time, you young monkey, and be d––d to you!\"–and that\nwas all that was heard about it.",
        "Sunday, August 7th.  Lat. 25° 59’ S., long. 27° 0’ W.  Spoke the\nEnglish bark Mary-Catherine, from Bahia, bound to Calcutta.\nThis was the first sail we had fallen in with, and the first\ntime we had seen a human form or heard the human voice, except of\nour own number, for nearly a hundred days.  The very yo-ho-ing of\nthe sailors at the ropes sounded sociably upon the ear.  She was\nan old, damaged-looking craft, with a high poop and top-gallant\nforecastle, and sawed off square, stem and stern, like a true\nEnglish “tea-wagon,” and with a run like a sugar-box.  She had\nstudding-sails out alow and aloft, with a light but steady breeze,\nand her captain said he could not get more than four knots out of\nher and thought he should have a long passage.  We were going six\non an easy bowline.",
        "The next day, about three P. M., passed a large corvette-built\nship, close upon the wind, with royals and skysails set fore\nand aft, under English colors.  She was standing south-by-east,\nprobably bound round Cape Horn.  She had men in her tops, and black\nmast-heads; heavily sparred, with sails cut to a t, and other marks\nof a man-of-war.  She sailed well, and presented a fine appearance;\nthe proud, aristocratic-looking banner of St. George, the cross in\na blood-red field, waving from the mizen.  We probably were as fine\na sight, with our studding-sails spread far out beyond the ship\non either side, and rising in a pyramid to royal studding-sails\nand sky-sails, burying the hull in canvas, and looking like what\nthe whale-men on the Banks, under their stump top-gallant masts,\ncall “a Cape Horn-er under a cloud of sail.”",
        "Friday, August 12th.  At daylight made the island of Trinidad,\nsituated in lat. 20° 28’ S., long. 29° 08’ W. At twelve M.,\nit bore N. W. 1/2 N., distant twenty-seven miles.  It was a\nbeautiful day, the sea hardly ruffled by the light trades,\nand the island looking like a small blue mound rising from\na field of glass.",
        "Such a fair and peaceful-looking spot is said to have been, for a\nlong time, the resort of a band of pirates, who ravaged the tropical\nseas.",
        "Thursday, August 18th.  At three P. M., made the island of Fernando\nNaronha, lying in lat. 3° 55’ S., long. 32° 35’ W.; and between\ntwelve o’clock Friday night and one o’clock Saturday morning,\ncrossed the equator, for the fourth time since leaving Boston,\nin long. 35° W.; having been twenty-seven days from Staten\nLand–a distance, by the courses we had made, of more than\nfour thousand miles.",
        "We were now to the northward of the line, and every day added to\nour latitude.  The Magellan Clouds, the last sign of South latitude,\nwere sunk in the horizon, and the north star, the Great Bear,\nand the familiar signs of northern latitudes, were rising in\nthe heavens.",
        "Next to seeing land, there is no sight which makes one realize\nmore that he is drawing near home, than to see the same heavens,\nunder which he was born, shining at night over his head.  The\nweather was extremely hot, with the usual tropical alternations\nof a scorching sun and squalls of rain; yet not a word was said\nin complaint of the heat, for we all remembered that only three or\nfour weeks before we would have given nearly our all to have been\nwhere we now were.  We had plenty of water, too, which we caught by\nspreading an awning, with shot thrown in to make hollows.  These\nrain squalls came up in the manner usual between the tropics.–A\nclear sky; burning, vertical sun; work going lazily on, and men\nabout decks with nothing but duck trowsers, checked shirts, and\nstraw hats; the ship moving as lazily through the water; the man\nat the helm resting against the wheel, with his hat drawn over\nhis eyes; the captain below, taking an afternoon nap; the passenger\nleaning over the taffrail, watching a dolphin following slowly in\nour wake; the sailmaker mending an old topsail on the lee side of\nthe quarter-deck; the carpenter working at his bench, in the waist;\nthe boys making sinnet; the spun-yarn winch whizzing round and round,\nand the men walking slowly fore and aft with their yarns.–A\ncloud rises to windward, looking a little black; the sky-sails are\nbrailed down; the captain puts his head out of the companion-way,\nlooks at the cloud, comes up, and begins to walk the deck.–The\ncloud spreads and comes on;–the tub of yarns, the sail, and other\nmatters, are thrown below, and the sky-light and booby-hatch put\non, and the slide drawn over the forecastle.–\"Stand by the royal\nhalyards;\"–the man at the wheel keeps a good weather helm, so as\nnot to be taken aback.  The squall strikes her.  If it is light,\nthe royal yards are clewed down, and the ship keeps on her way;\nbut if the squall takes strong hold, the royals are clewed up,\nfore and aft; light hands lay aloft and furl them; top-gallant\nyards clewed down, flying-jib hauled down, and the ship kept off\nbefore it,–the man at the helm laying out his strength to heave\nthe wheel up to windward.  At the same time a drenching rain,\nwhich soaks one through in an instant.  Yet no one puts on a\njacket or cap; for if it is only warm, a sailor does not mind\na ducking; and the sun will soon be out again.  As soon as the\nforce of the squall has passed, though to a common eye the ship\nwould seem to be in the midst of it,–\"Keep her up to her course,\nagain!\"–\"Keep her up, sir,” (answer);–\"Hoist away the top-gallant\nyards!\"–\"Run up the flying jib!\"–\"Lay aloft, you boys, and loose\nthe royals!\"–and all sail is on her again before she is fairly\nout of the squall; and she is going on in her course.  The sun\ncomes out once more, hotter than ever, dries up the decks and\nthe sailors’ clothes; the hatches are taken off; the sail got up\nand spread on the quarter-deck; spun-yarn winch set a whirling\nagain; rigging coiled up; captain goes below; and every sign of\nan interruption is removed.",
        "These scenes, with occasional dead calms, lasting for hours, and\nsometimes for days, are fair specimens of the Atlantic tropics.\nThe nights were fine; and as we had all hands all day, the watch\nwere allowed to sleep on deck at night, except the man at the\nwheel, and one look-out on the forecastle.  This was not so much\nexpressly allowed, as winked at.  We could do it if we did not\nask leave.  If the look-out was caught napping, the whole watch\nwas kept awake.",
        "We made the most of this permission, and stowed ourselves away\nupon the rigging, under the weather rail, on the spars, under the\nwindlass, and in all the snug corners; and frequently slept out\nthe watch, unless we had a wheel or a look-out.  And we were glad\nenough to get this rest; for under the “all hands” system, out of\nevery other thirty-six hours, we had only four below; and even\nan hour’s sleep was a gain not to be neglected.  One would have\nthought so, to have seen our watch, some nights, sleeping through\na heavy rain.  And often have we come on deck, and finding a\ndead calm and a light, steady rain, and determined not to lose\nour sleep, have laid a coil of rigging down so as to keep us out\nof the water which was washing about decks, and stowed ourselves\naway upon it, covering a jacket over us, and slept as soundly as\na Dutchman between two feather beds.",
        "For a week or ten days after crossing the line, we had the usual\nvariety of calms, squalls, head winds, and fair winds;–at one\ntime braced sharp upon the wind, with a taught bowline, and in\nan hour after, slipping quietly along, with a light breeze over\nthe taffrail, and studding-sails out on both sides;–until we fell\nin with the north-east trade-winds; which we did on the afternoon of",
        "Sunday, August 28th, in lat. 12° N. The trade-wind clouds had been\nin sight for a day or two previously, and we expected to take them\nevery hour.  The light southerly breeze, which had been blowing\nlanguidly during the first part of the day, died away toward noon,\nand in its place came puffs from the north-east, which caused us\nto take our studding-sails in and brace up; and in a couple of\nhours more, we were bowling gloriously along, dashing the spray\nfar ahead and to leeward, with the cool, steady north-east trades,\nfreshening up the sea, and giving us as much as we could carry\nour royals to.  These winds blew strong and steady, keeping us\ngenerally upon a bowline, as our course was about north-north-west;\nand sometimes, as they veered a little to the eastward, giving us\na chance at a main top-gallant studding-sail; and sending us well\nto the northward, until–",
        "Sunday, Sept. 4th, when they left us, in lat. 22° N., long. 51° W.,\ndirectly under the tropic of Cancer. ",
        "For several days we lay “humbugging about” in the Horse latitudes,\nwith all sorts of winds and weather, and occasionally, as we were in\nthe latitude of the West Indies–a thunder storm.  It was hurricane\nmonth, too, and we were just in the track of the tremendous hurricane\nof 1830, which swept the North Atlantic, destroying almost everything\nbefore it.  The first night after the tradewinds left us, while we\nwere in the latitude of the island of Cuba, we had a specimen of\na true tropical thunder storm.  A light breeze had been blowing\ndirectly from aft during the first part of the night which gradually\ndied away, and before midnight it was dead calm, and a heavy black\ncloud had shrouded the whole sky.  When our watch came on deck at\ntwelve o’clock, it was as black as Erebus; the studding-sails were\nall taken in, and the royals furled; not a breath was stirring;\nthe sails hung heavy and motionless from the yards; and the\nperfect stillness, and the darkness, which was almost palpable,\nwere truly appalling.  Not a word was spoken, but every one stood\nas though waiting for something to happen.  In a few minutes the\nmate came forward; and in a low tone, which was almost a whisper,\ntold us to haul down the jib.  The fore and mizen top-gallant sails\nwere taken in, in the same silent manner; and we lay motionless upon\nthe water, with an uneasy expectation, which, from the long suspense,\nbecame actually painful.  We could hear the captain walking the deck,\nbut it was too dark to see anything more than one’s hand before the\nface.  Soon the mate came forward again, and gave an order, in a\nlow tone, to clew up the main top-gallant sail; and so infectious\nwas the awe and silence, that the clewlines and buntlines were\nhauled up without any of the customary singing out at the ropes.\nAn English lad and myself went up to furl it; and we had just got\nthe bunt up, when the mate called out to us, something, we did\nnot hear what,–but supposing it to be an order to bear-a-hand,\nwe hurried, and made all fast, and came down, feeling our way among\nthe rigging.  When we got down we found all hands looking aloft,\nand there, directly over where we had been standing, upon the main\ntop-gallant-mast-head, was a ball of light, which the sailors name\na corposant (corpus sancti), and which the mate had called out to\nus to look at.  They were all watching it carefully, for sailors\nhave a notion that if the corposant rises in the rigging, it is\na sign of fair weather, but if it comes lower down, there will\nbe a storm.  Unfortunately, as an omen, it came down, and showed\nitself on the top-gallant yard-arm.  We were off the yard in good\nseason, for it is held a fatal sign to have the pale light of the\ncorposant thrown upon one’s face.  As it was, the English lad did\nnot feel comfortably at having had it so near him, and directly\nover his head.  In a few minutes it disappeared, and showed itself\nagain on the fore top-gallant yard; and after playing about for\nsome time, disappeared again; when the man on the forecastle\npointed to it upon the flying-jib-boom-end.  But our attention\nwas drawn from watching this, by the falling of some drops of\nrain and by a perceptible increase of the darkness, which seemed\nsuddenly to add a new shade of blackness to the night.  In a few\nminutes, low, grumbling thunder was heard, and some random flashes\nof lightning came from the south-west.  Every sail was taken in\nbut the topsails, still, no squall appeared to be coming.  A few\npuffs lifted the topsails, but they fell again to the mast, and all\nwas as still as ever.  A moment more, and a terrific flash and peal\nbroke simultaneously upon us, and a cloud appeared to open directly\nover our heads and let down the water in one body, like a falling\nocean.  We stood motionless, and almost stupefied; yet nothing had\nbeen struck.  Peal after peal rattled over our heads, with a sound\nwhich seemed actually to stop the breath in the body, and the\n\"speedy gleams” kept the whole ocean in a glare of light.\nThe violent fall of rain lasted but a few minutes, and was\nsucceeded by occasional drops and showers; but the lightning\ncontinued incessant for several hours, breaking the midnight\ndarkness with irregular and blinding flashes.  During all which\ntime there was not a breath stirring, and we lay motionless, like a\nmark to be shot at, probably the only object on the surface of the\nocean for miles and miles.  We stood hour after hour, until our\nwatch was out, and we were relieved, at four o’clock.  During all\nthis time, hardly a word was spoken; no bells were struck, and the\nwheel was silently relieved.  The rain fell at intervals in heavy\nshowers, and we stood drenched through and blinded by the flashes,\nwhich broke the Egyptian darkness with a brightness which seemed\nalmost malignant; while the thunder rolled in peals, the concussion\nof which appeared to shake the very ocean.  A ship is not often\ninjured by lightning, for the electricity is separated by the\ngreat number of points she presents, and the quantity of iron\nwhich she has scattered in various parts.  The electric fluid\nran over our anchors, top-sail sheets and ties; yet no harm was\ndone to us.  We went below at four o’clock, leaving things in the\nsame state.  It is not easy to sleep, when the very next flash may\ntear the ship in two, or set her on fire; or where the deathlike\ncalm may be broken by the blast of a hurricane, taking the masts\nout of the ship.  But a man is no sailor if he cannot sleep when\nhe turns-in, and turn out when he’s called.  And when, at seven\nbells, the customary “All the larboard watch, ahoy?” brought us\non deck, it was a fine, clear, sunny morning, the ship going\nleisurely along, with a good breeze and all sail set.",
        "From the latitude of the West Indies, until we got inside the Bermudas,\nwhere we took the westerly and south-westerly winds, which blow\nsteadily off the coast of the United States early in the autumn,\nwe had every variety of weather, and two or three moderate gales,\nor, as sailors call them, double-reef-topsail breezes, which came\non in the usual manner, and of which one is a specimen of all.–A\nfine afternoon; all hands at work, some in the rigging, and others\non deck; a stiff breeze, and ship close upon the wind, and skysails\nbrailed down.–Latter part of the afternoon, breeze increases, ship\nlies over to it, and clouds look windy.  Spray begins to fly over\nthe forecastle, and wets the yarns the boys are knotting;–ball\nthem up and put them below.–Mate knocks off work and clears up\ndecks earlier than usual, and orders a man who has been employed\naloft to send the royal halyards over to windward, as he comes\ndown.  Breast backstays hauled taught, and tackle got upon the\nmartingale back-rope.–One of the boys furls the mizen royal.–Cook\nthinks there is going to be “nasty work,” and has supper ready\nearly.–Mate gives orders to get supper by the watch, instead of\nall hands, as usual.–While eating supper, hear the watch on deck\ntaking in the royals.–Coming on deck, find it is blowing harder,\nand an ugly head sea is running.–Instead of having all hands on the\nforecastle in the dog watch, smoking, singing, and telling yarns,\none watch goes below and turns-in, saying that it’s going to be an\nugly night, and two hours’ sleep is not to be lost.",
        "Clouds look black and wild; wind rising, and ship working hard\nagainst a heavy sea, which breaks over the forecastle, and washes\naft through the scuppers.  Still, no more sail is taken in, for the\ncaptain is a driver, and, like all drivers, very partial to his\ntop-gallant sails.  A top-gallant sail, too, makes the difference\nbetween a breeze and a gale.  When a top-gallant sail is on a ship,\nit is only a breeze, though I have seen ours set over a reefed\ntopsail, when half the bowsprit was under water, and it was up\nto a man’s knees in the scuppers.  At eight bells, nothing is said\nabout reefing the topsails, and the watch go below, with orders to\n\"stand by for a call.”  We turn-in, growling at the “old man” for\nnot reefing the topsails when the watch was changed, but putting\nit off so as to call all hands, and break up a whole watch below.\nTurn-in “all standing,” and keep ourselves awake, saying there is\nno use in going asleep to be waked up again.–Wind whistles on\ndeck, and ship works hard, groaning and creaking, and pitching\ninto a heavy head sea, which strikes against the bows, with a\nnoise like knocking upon a rock.–The dim lamp in the forecastle\nswings to and fro, and things “fetch away” and go over to\nleeward.–\"Doesn’t that booby of a second mate ever mean to\ntake in his top-gallant sails?–He’ll have the sticks out of\nher soon,” says old Bill, who was always growling, and, like\nmost old sailors, did not like to see a ship abused.–By-and-by\nan order is given–\"Aye, aye, sir!” from the forecastle;–rigging\nis heaved down on deck;–the noise of a sail is heard fluttering\naloft, and the short, quick cry which sailors make when hauling\nupon clewlines.–\"Here comes his fore-top-gallant sail in!\"–We\nare wide awake, and know all that’s going on as well as if we were\non deck.–A well-known voice is heard from the mast-head singing out\nthe officer of the watch to haul taught the weather brace.–\"Hallo!\nThere’s S––- aloft to furl the sail!\"–Next thing, rigging is\nheaved down directly over our heads, and a long-drawn cry and a\nrattling of hanks announce that the flying-jib has come in.–The\nsecond mate holds on to the main top-gallant sail until a heavy\nsea is shipped, and washes over the forecastle as though the\nwhole ocean had come aboard; when a noise further aft shows\nthat that sail, too, is taking in.  After this, the ship is\nmore easy for a time; two bells are struck, and we try to get a\nlittle sleep.  By-and-by, bang, bang, bang, on the scuttle–\"All\nha-a-ands, a ho-o-y!\"–We spring out of our berths, clap on a\nmonkey-jacket and southwester, and tumble up the ladder.–Mate\nup before us, and on the forecastle, singing out like a roaring\nbull; the captain singing out on the quarter-deck, and the second\nmate yelling, like a hyena, in the waist.  The ship is lying over\nhalf upon her beam-ends; lee scuppers under water, and forecastle\nall in a smother of foam.–Rigging all let go, and washing about\ndecks; topsail yards down upon the caps, and sails flapping and\nbeating against the masts; and starboard watch hauling out the\nreef-tackles of the main topsail.  Our watch haul out the fore,\nand lay aloft and put two reefs into it, and reef the foresail,\nand race with the starboard watch, to see which will mast-head its\ntopsail first.  All hands tally-on to the main tack, and while some\nare furling the jib, and hoisting the staysail, we mizen-topmen\ndouble-reef the mizen topsail and hoist it up.  All being made fast\n–\"Go below, the watch!” and we turn-in to sleep out the rest of the\ntime, which is perhaps an hour and a half.  During all the middle,\nand for the first part of the morning watch, it blows as hard as\never, but toward daybreak it moderates considerably, and we shake\na reef out of each topsail, and set the top-gallant sails over\nthem and when the watch come up, at seven bells, for breakfast,\nshake the other reefs out, turn all hands to upon the halyards,\nget the watch-tackle upon the top-gallant sheets and halyards,\nset the flying-jib, and crack on to her again.",
        "Our captain had been married only a few weeks before he left Boston;\nand, after an absence of over two years, it may be supposed he was\nnot slow in carrying sail.  The mate, too, was not to be beaten by\nanybody; and the second mate, though he was afraid to press sail,\nwas afraid as death of the captain, and being between two fears,\nsometimes carried on longer than any of them.  We snapped off three\nflying-jib booms in twenty-four hours, as fast as they could be\nfitted and rigged out; sprung the spritsail yard; and made nothing\nof studding-sail booms.  Beside the natural desire to get home,\nwe had another reason for urging the ship on.  The scurvy had begun\nto show itself on board.  One man had it so badly as to be disabled\nand off duty, and the English lad, Ben, was in a dreadful state,\nand was daily growing worse.  His legs swelled and pained him so\nthat he could not walk; his flesh lost its elasticity, so that if\nit was pressed in, it would not return to its shape; and his gums\nswelled until he could not open his mouth.  His breath, too, became\nvery offensive; he lost all strength and spirit; could eat nothing;\ngrew worse every day; and, in fact, unless something was done for\nhim, would be a dead man in a week, at the rate at which he was\nsinking.  The medicines were all, or nearly all, gone; and if we had\nhad a chest-full, they would have been of no use; for nothing but\nfresh provisions and terra firma has any effect upon the scurvy.\nThis disease is not so common now as formerly; and is attributed\ngenerally to salt provisions, want of cleanliness, the free\nuse of grease and fat (which is the reason of its prevalence\namong whalemen,) and, last of all, to laziness.  It never could\nhave been from the latter cause on board our ship; nor from the\nsecond, for we were a very cleanly crew, kept our forecastle in\nneat order, and were more particular about washing and changing\nclothes than many better-dressed people on shore.  It was probably\nfrom having none but salt provisions, and possibly from our having\nrun very rapidly into hot weather, after having been so long in\nthe extremest cold.",
        "Depending upon the westerly winds, which prevail off the coast in\nthe autumn, the captain stood well to the westward, to run inside\nof the Bermudas, and in the hope of falling in with some vessel\nbound to the West Indies or the Southern States.  The scurvy had\nspread no farther among the crew, but there was danger that it\nmight; and these cases were bad ones.",
        "Sunday, Sept. 11th.  Lat. 30° 04’ N., long. 63° 23’ W.; the Bermudas\nbearing north-north-west, distant one hundred and fifty miles.\nThe next morning, about ten o’clock, “Sail ho!” was cried on deck;\nand all hands turned up to see the stranger.  As she drew nearer,\nshe proved to be an ordinary-looking hermaphrodite brig, standing\nsouth-south-east; and probably bound out, from the Northern States,\nto the West Indies; and was just the thing we wished to see.\nShe hove-to for us, seeing that we wished to speak her; and we\nran down to her; boom-ended our studding-sails; backed our main\ntopsail, and hailed her–\"Brig, ahoy!\"–\"Hallo!\"–\"Where are you\nfrom, pray?\"–\"From New York, bound to Curaçoa.\"–\"Have you any\nfresh provisions to spare?\"–\"Aye, aye! plenty of them!”  We\nlowered away the quarter-boat, instantly; and the captain and\nfour hands sprang in, and were soon dancing over the water,\nand alongside the brig.  In about half an hour, they returned\nwith half a boat-load of potatoes and onions, and each vessel\nfilled away, and kept on her course.  She proved to be the brig\nSolon, of Plymouth, from the Connecticut river, and last from New\nYork, bound to the Spanish Main, with a cargo of fresh provisions,\nmules, tin bake-pans, and other notions.  The onions were genuine\nand fresh; and the mate of the brig told the men in the boat, as he\npassed the bunches over the side, that the girls had strung them\non purpose for us the day he sailed.  We had supposed, on board,\nthat a new president had been chosen, the last winter, and, just\nas we filled away, the captain hailed and asked who was president\nof the United States.  They answered, Andrew Jackson; but thinking\nthat the old General could not have been elected for a third time,\nwe hailed again, and they answered–Jack Downing; and left us to\ncorrect the mistake at our leisure.",
        "It was just dinner-time when we filled away; and the steward,\ntaking a few bunches of onions for the cabin, gave the rest to us,\nwith a bottle of vinegar.  We carried them forward, stowed them\naway in the forecastle, refusing to have them cooked, and ate\nthem raw, with our beef and bread.  And a glorious treat they\nwere.  The freshness and crispness of the raw onion, with the\nearthy taste, give it a great relish to one who has been a long\ntime on salt provisions.",
        "We were perfectly ravenous after them.  It was like a scent\nof blood to a hound.  We ate them at every meal, by the dozen;\nand filled our pockets with them, to eat in our watch on deck;\nand the bunches, rising in the form of a cone, from the largest\nat the bottom, to the smallest, no larger than a strawberry,\nat the top, soon disappeared.",
        "The chief use, however, of the fresh provisions, was for the men\nwith the scurvy.  One of them was able to eat, and he soon brought\nhimself to, by gnawing upon raw potatoes; but the other, by this time,\nwas hardly able to open his mouth; and the cook took the potatoes raw,\npounded them in a mortar, and gave him the juice to drink.  This\nhe swallowed, by the tea-spoonful at a time, and rinsed it about\nhis gums and throat.  The strong earthy taste and smell of this\nextract of the raw potato at first produced a shuddering through\nhis whole frame, and after drinking it, an acute pain, which ran\nthrough all parts of his body; but knowing, by this, that it was\ntaking strong hold, he persevered, drinking a spoonful every hour\nor so, and holding it a long time in his mouth; until, by the\neffect of this drink, and of his own restored hope, (for he had\nnearly given up, in despair) he became so well as to be able to\nmove about, and open his mouth enough to eat the raw potatoes and\nonions pounded into a soft pulp.  This course soon restored his\nappetite and strength; and in ten days after we spoke the Solon,\nso rapid was his recovery, that, from lying helpless and almost\nhopeless in his berth, he was at the mast-head, furling a royal.",
        "With a fine south-west wind, we passed inside of the Bermudas;\nand notwithstanding the old couplet, which was quoted again and\nagain by those who thought we should have one more touch of a\nstorm before our voyage was up,–",
        "“If the Bermudas let you pass,\nYou must beware of Hatteras–”",
        "we were to the northward of Hatteras, with good weather, and beginning\nto count, not the days, but the hours, to the time when we should be\nat anchor in Boston harbor.",
        "Our ship was in fine order, all hands having been hard at work\nupon her from daylight to dark, every day but Sunday, from the\ntime we got into warm weather on this side the Cape. ",
        "It is a common notion with landsmen that a ship is in her finest\ncondition when she leaves port to enter upon her voyage; and that\nshe comes home, after a long absence,",
        "“With over-weathered ribs and ragged sails;\nLean, rent and beggared by the strumpet wind.” ",
        "But so far from that, unless a ship meets with some accident, or\ncomes upon the coast in the dead of winter, when work cannot be\ndone upon the rigging, she is in her finest order at the end of\nthe voyage.  When she sails from port, her rigging is generally\nslack; the masts need staying; the decks and sides are black and\ndirty from taking in cargo; riggers’ seizings and overhand knots\nin place of nice seamanlike work; and everything, to a sailor’s\neye, adrift.",
        "But on the passage home, the fine weather between the tropics is\nspent in putting the ship into the neatest order.  No merchant vessel\nlooks better than an Indiaman, or a Cape Horn-er, after a long voyage;\nand many captains and mates will stake their reputation for seamanship\nupon the appearance of their ship when she hauls into the dock.\nAll our standing rigging, fore and aft, was set up and tarred;\nthe masts stayed; the lower and top-mast rigging rattled down,\n(or up, as the fashion now is;) and so careful were our officers\nto keep the rattlins taught and straight, that we were obliged\nto go aloft upon the ropes and shearpoles with which the rigging\nwas swifted in; and these were used as jury rattlins until we got\nclose upon the coast.  After this, the ship was scraped, inside and\nout, decks, masts, booms and all; a stage being rigged outside,\nupon which we scraped her down to the water-line; pounding the\nrust off the chains, bolts and fastenings.  Then, taking two days\nof calm under the line, we painted her on the outside, giving her\nopen ports in her streak, and finishing off the nice work upon the\nstern, where sat Neptune in his car, holding his trident, drawn\nby sea-horses; and re-touched the gilding and coloring of the\ncornucopia which ornamented her billet-head.  The inside was then\npainted, from the skysail truck to the waterways–the yards black;\nmast-heads and tops, white; monkey-rail, black, white, and yellow;\nbulwarks, green; plank-shear, white; waterways, lead color, etc.,\netc. The anchors and ring-bolts, and other iron work, were blackened\nwith coal-tar; and the steward kept at work, polishing the brass\nof the wheel, bell, capstan, etc.  The cabin, too, was scraped,\nvarnished, and painted; and the forecastle scraped and scrubbed;\nthere being no need of paint and varnish for Jack’s quarters.\nThe decks were then scraped and varnished, and everything useless\nthrown overboard; among which the empty tar barrels were set on\nfire and thrown overboard, on a dark night, and left blazing\nastern, lighting up the ocean for miles.  Add to all this labor,\nthe neat work upon the rigging;–the knots, flemish-eyes, splices,\nseizings, coverings, pointings, and graftings, which show a ship in\ncrack order.  The last preparation, and which looked still more\nlike coming into port, was getting the anchors over the bows,\nbending the cables, rowsing the hawsers up from between decks,\nand overhauling the deep-sea-lead-line.",
        "Thursday, September 15th.  This morning the temperature and\npeculiar appearance of the water, the quantities of gulf-weed\nfloating about, and a bank of clouds lying directly before\nus, showed that we were on the border of the Gulf Stream.\nThis remarkable current, running north-east, nearly across\nthe ocean, is almost constantly shrouded in clouds, and is the\nregion of storms and heavy seas.  Vessels often run from a clear\nsky and light wind, with all sail, at once into a heavy sea and\ncloudy sky, with double-reefed topsails.  A sailor told me that\non a passage from Gibraltar to Boston, his vessel neared the\nGulf Stream with a light breeze, clear sky, and studding-sails\nout, alow and aloft; while, before it, was a long line of heavy,\nblack clouds, lying like a bank upon the water, and a vessel coming\nout of it, under double-reefed topsails, and with royal yards sent\ndown.  As they drew near, they began to take in sail after sail,\nuntil they were reduced to the same condition; and, after twelve\nor fourteen hours of rolling and pitching in a heavy sea, before a\nsmart gale, they ran out of the bank on the other side, and were in\nfine weather again, and under their royals and skysails.  As we drew\ninto it, the sky became cloudy, the sea high, and everything had the\nappearance of the going off, or the coming on, of a storm.  It was\nblowing no more than a stiff breeze; yet the wind, being north-east,\nwhich is directly against the course of the current, made an ugly,\nchopping sea, which heaved and pitched the vessel about, so that\nwe were obliged to send down the royal yards, and to take in our\nlight sails.  At noon, the thermometer, which had been repeatedly\nlowered into the water, showed the temperature to be seventy;\nwhich was considerably above that of the air,–as is always\nthe case in the centre of the Stream.  A lad who had been at\nwork at the royal mast-head, came down upon the deck, and took\na turn round the long-boat; and looking very pale, said he was\nso sick that he could stay aloft no longer, but was ashamed to\nacknowledge it to the officer.  He went up again, but soon gave\nout and came down, and leaned over the rail, “as sick as a lady\npassenger.”",
        "He had been to sea several years, and had, he said, never been\nsick before.  He was made so by the irregular, pitching motion\nof the vessel, increased by the height to which he had been above\nthe hull, which is like the fulcrum of the lever.  An old sailor,\nwho was at work on the top-gallant yard, said he felt disagreeably\nall the time, and was glad, when his job was done, to get down\ninto the top, or upon the deck.  Another hand was sent to the\nroyal mast-head, who staid nearly an hour, but gave up.  The work\nmust be done, and the mate sent me.  I did very well for some time,\nbut began at length to feel very unpleasantly, though I had never\nbeen sick since the first two days from Boston, and had been in all\nsorts of weather and situations.  Still, I kept my place, and did\nnot come down, until I had got through my work, which was more\nthan two hours.  The ship certainly never acted so badly before.\nShe was pitched and jerked about in all manner of ways; the sails\nseeming to have no steadying power over her.  The tapering points\nof the masts made various curves and angles against the sky overhead,\nand sometimes, in one sweep of an instant, described an arc of more\nthan forty-five degrees, bringing up with a sudden jerk which made\nit necessary to hold on with both hands, and then sweeping off,\nin another long, irregular curve.  I was not positively sick,\nand came down with a look of indifference, yet was not unwilling\nto get upon the comparative terra firma of the deck.  A few hours\nmore carried us through, and when we saw the sun go down, upon our\nlarboard beam, in the direction of the continent of North America,\nwe had left the bank of dark, stormy clouds astern, in the twilight.",
        "Friday, Sept. 16th.  Lat. 38° N., long. 69° 00’ W.  A fine south-west\nwind; every hour carrying us nearer in toward land.  All hands on deck\nat the dog watch, and nothing talked about, but our getting in; where\nwe should make the land; whether we should arrive before Sunday;\ngoing to church; how Boston would look; friends; wages paid;–and\nthe like.  Every one was in the best of spirits; and, the voyage\nbeing nearly at an end, the strictness of discipline was relaxed;\nfor it was not necessary to order in a cross tone, what every one\nwas ready to do with a will.",
        "The little differences and quarrels which a long voyage breeds\non board a ship, were forgotten, and every one was friendly;\nand two men, who had been on the eve of a battle half the voyage,\nwere laying out a plan together for a cruise on shore.  When the\nmate came forward, he talked to the men, and said we should be\non George’s Bank before to-morrow noon; and joked with the boys,\npromising to go and see them, and to take them down to Marblehead\nin a coach.",
        "Saturday, 17th.  The wind was light all day, which kept us back\nsomewhat; but a fine breeze springing up at nightfall, we were\nrunning fast in toward the land.  At six o’clock we expected to\nhave the ship hove-to for soundings, as a thick fog, coming up\nshowed we were near them; but no order was given, and we kept\non our way.  Eight o’clock came, and the watch went below,\nand, for the whole of the first hour, the ship was tearing on,\nwith studding-sails out, alow and aloft, and the night as dark\nas a pocket.  At two bells the captain came on deck, and said a\nword to the mate, when the studding sails were hauled into the\ntops, or boom-ended, the after yards backed, the deep-sea-lead\ncarried forward, and everything got ready for sounding.  A man\non the spritsail yard with the lead, another on the cathead with\na handful of the line coiled up, another in the fore chains,\nanother in the waist, and another in the main chains, each with\na quantity of the line coiled away in his hand.  “All ready there,\nforward?\"–\"Aye, aye, sir!\"–\"He-e-e-ave!\"–\"Watch! ho! watch!\"\nsings out the man on the spritsail yard, and the heavy lead drops\ninto the water.  “Watch! ho! watch!” bawls the man on the cat-head,\nas the last fake of the coil drops from his hand, and “Watch! ho!\nwatch!” is shouted by each one as the line falls from his hold;\nuntil it comes to the mate, who tends the lead, and has the line\nin coils on the quarter-deck.  Eighty fathoms, and no bottom!  A\ndepth as great as the height of St. Peter’s!  The line is snatched\nin a block upon the swifter, and three or four men haul it in and\ncoil it away.  The after yards are braced full, the studding-sails\nhauled out again, and in a few minutes more the ship had her\nwhole way upon her.  At four bells, backed again, hove the lead,\nand–soundings! at sixty fathoms!  Hurrah for Yankee land!  Hand\nover hand, we hauled the lead in, and the captain, taking it to\nthe light, found black mud on the bottom.",
        "Studding-sails taken in; after yards filled, and ship kept on under\neasy sail all night; the wind dying away. ",
        "The soundings on the American coast are so regular that a navigator\nknows as well where he has made land, by the soundings, as he\nwould by seeing the land.  Black mud is the soundings of Block\nIsland.  As you go toward Nantucket, it changes to a dark sand;\nthen, sand and white shells; and on George’s Banks, white sand;\nand so on.  Being off Block Island, our course was due east, to\nNantucket Shoals, and the South Channel; but the wind died away\nand left us becalmed in a thick fog, in which we lay the whole\nof Sunday.  At noon of",
        "Sunday, 18th, Block Island bore, by calculation, N. W. 1/4 W.\nfifteen miles; but the fog was so thick all day that we could see\nnothing. ",
        "Having got through the ship’s duty, and washed and shaved, we went\nbelow, and had a fine time overhauling our chests, laying aside the\nclothes we meant to go ashore in and throwing overboard all that were\nworn out and good for nothing.  Away went the woollen caps in which\nwe had carried hides upon our heads, for sixteen months, on the\ncoast of California; the duck frocks, for tarring down rigging;\nand the worn-out and darned mittens and patched woollen trowsers\nwhich had stood the tug of Cape Horn.",
        "We hove them overboard with a good will; for there is nothing\nlike being quit of the very last appendages and remnants of\nour evil fortune.  We got our chests all ready for going ashore,\nate the last “duff” we expected to have on board the ship Alert;\nand talked as confidently about matters on shore as though our\nanchor were on the bottom.",
        "“Who’ll go to church with me a week from to-day?” ",
        "“I will,” says Jack; who said aye to everything. ",
        "“Go away, salt water!” says Tom.  “As soon as I get both legs\nashore, I’m going to shoe my heels, and button my ears behind me,\nand start off into the bush, a straight course, and not stop till\nI’m out of the sight of salt water!”",
        "“Oh! belay that!  Spin that yarn where nobody knows your filling!\nIf you get once moored, stem and stern, in old B––-’s grog-shop,\nwith a coal fire ahead and the bar under your lee, you won’t see\ndaylight for three weeks!”",
        "“No!” says Tom, “I’m going to knock off grog, and go and board\nat the Home, and see if they won’t ship me for a deacon!” ",
        "“And I,” says Bill, “am going to buy a quadrant and ship for\nnavigator of a Hingham packet!” ",
        "These and the like jokes served to pass the time while we were\nlying waiting for a breeze to clear up the fog and send us on our\nway. ",
        "Toward night a moderate breeze sprang up; the fog however continuing\nas thick as before; and we kept on to the eastward.  About the middle\nof the first watch, a man on the forecastle sang out, in a tone which\nshowed that there was not a moment to be lost,–\"Hard up the helm!\"\nand a great ship loomed up out of the fog, coming directly down\nupon us.  She luffed at the same moment, and we just passed one\nanother; our spanker boom grazing over her quarter.  The officer\nof the deck had only time to hail, and she answered, as she went\ninto the fog again, something about Bristol–probably, a whaleman\nfrom Bristol, Rhode Island, bound out.  The fog continued through the\nnight, with a very light breeze, before which we ran to the eastward,\nliterally feeling our way along.  The lead was heaved every two hours,\nand the gradual change from black mud to sand, showed that we were\napproaching Nantucket South Shoals.  On Monday morning, the increased\ndepth and deep blue color of the water, and the mixture of shells and\nwhite sand which we brought up, upon sounding, showed that we were\nin the channel, and nearing George’s; accordingly, the ship’s head\nwas put directly to the northward, and we stood on, with perfect\nconfidence in the soundings, though we had not taken an observation\nfor two days, nor seen land; and the difference of an eighth of\na mile out of the way might put us ashore.  Throughout the day a\nprovokingly light wind prevailed, and at eight o’clock, a small\nfishing schooner, which we passed, told us we were nearly abreast\nof Chatham lights.",
        "Just before midnight, a light land-breeze sprang up, which carried\nus well along; and at four o’clock, thinking ourselves to the\nnorthward of Race Point, we hauled upon the wind and stood\ninto the bay, west-north-west, for Boston light, and commenced\nfiring guns for a pilot.  Our watch went below at four o’clock,\nbut could not sleep, for the watch on deck were banging away at\nthe guns every few minutes.  And, indeed, we cared very little\nabout it, for we were in Boston Bay; and if fortune favored us,\nwe could all “sleep in” the next night, with nobody to call the\nwatch every four hours.",
        "We turned out, of our own will, at daybreak, to get a sight of land. ",
        "In the grey of the morning, one or two small fishing smacks peered\nout of the mist; and when the broad day broke upon us, there lay the\nlow sand-hills of Cape Cod, over our larboard quarter, and before us,\nthe wide waters of Massachusetts Bay, with here and there a sail\ngliding over its smooth surface.  As we drew in toward the mouth\nof the harbor, as toward a focus, the vessels began to multiply\nuntil the bay seemed actually alive with sails gliding about in\nevery direction; some on the wind, and others before it, as they\nwere bound to or from the emporium of trade and centre of the bay.\nIt was a stirring sight for us, who had been months on the ocean\nwithout seeing anything but two solitary sails; and over two years\nwithout seeing more than the three or four traders on an almost\ndesolate coast.  There were the little coasters, bound to and\nfrom the various towns along the south shore, down in the bight\nof the bay, and to the eastward; here and there a square-rigged\nvessel standing out to seaward; and, far in the distance,\nbeyond Cape Ann, was the smoke of a steamer, stretching along in\na narrow, black cloud upon the water.  Every sight was full of\nbeauty and interest.  We were coming back to our homes; and the\nsigns of civilization, and prosperity, and happiness, from which\nwe had been so long banished, were multiplying about us.  The high\nland of Cape Ann and the rocks and shore of Cohasset were full in\nsight, the lighthouses, standing like sentries in white before\nthe harbors, and even the smoke from the chimney on the plains\nof Hingham was seen rising slowly in the morning air.  One of\nour boys was the son of a bucket-maker; and his face lighted\nup as he saw the tops of the well-known hills which surround his\nnative place.  About ten o’clock a little boat came bobbing over\nthe water, and put a pilot on board, and sheered off in pursuit\nof other vessels bound in.",
        "Being now within the scope of the telegraph stations, our signals\nwere run up at the fore, and in half an hour afterwards, the owner\non ’change, or in his counting-room, knew that his ship was below;\nand the landlords, runners, and sharks in Ann street learned that\nthere was a rich prize for them down in the bay: a ship from round\nthe Horn, with a crew to be paid off with two years’ wages.",
        "The wind continuing very light, all hands were sent aloft to\nstrip off the chafing gear; and battens, parcellings, roundings,\nhoops, mats, and leathers, came flying from aloft, and left the\nrigging neat and clean, stripped of all its sea bandaging.  The\nlast touch was put to the vessel by painting the skysail poles;\nand I was sent up to the fore, with a bucket of white paint and\na brush, and touched her off, from the truck to the eyes of the\nroyal rigging.  At noon, we lay becalmed off the lower light-house;\nand it being about slack water, we made little progress.  A firing\nwas heard in the direction of Hingham, and the pilot said there\nwas a review there.",
        "The Hingham boy got wind of this, and said if the ship had been\ntwelve hours sooner, he should have been down among the soldiers,\nand in the booths, and having a grand time.  As it was, we had\nlittle prospect of getting in before night.  About two o’clock a\nbreeze sprang up ahead, from the westward, and we began beating\nup against it.  A full-rigged brig was beating in at the same\ntime, and we passed one another, in our tacks, sometimes one\nand sometimes the other, working to windward, as the wind and\ntide favored or opposed.  It was my trick at the wheel from two\ntill four; and I stood my last helm, making between nine hundred\nand a thousand hours which I had spent at the helms of our two\nvessels.  The tide beginning to set against us, we made slow work;\nand the afternoon was nearly spent, before we got abreast of the\ninner light.  In the meantime, several vessels were coming down,\noutward bound; among which, a fine, large ship, with yards squared,\nfair wind and fair tide, passed us like a race-horse, the men\nrunning out upon her yards to rig out the studding-sail booms.\nToward sundown the wind came off in flaws, sometimes blowing\nvery stiff, so that the pilot took in the royals, and then it\ndied away; when, in order to get us in before the tide became\ntoo strong, the royals were set again.  As this kept us running\nup and down the rigging all the time, one hand was sent aloft at\neach mast-head, to stand-by to loose and furl the sails, at the\nmoment of the order.  I took my place at the fore, and loosed\nand furled the royal five times between Rainsford Island and the\nCastle.  At one tack we ran so near to Rainsford Island, that,\nlooking down from the royal yard, the island, with its hospital\nbuildings, nice gravelled walks, and green plats, seemed to lie\ndirectly under our yard-arms.  So close is the channel to some of\nthese islands, that we ran the end of our flying-jib-boom over\none of the out-works of the fortifications on George’s Island;\nand had an opportunity of seeing the advantages of that point as\na fortified place; for, in working up the channel, we presented\na fair stem and stern, for raking, from the batteries, three or\nfour times.  One gun might have knocked us to pieces.",
        "We had all set our hearts upon getting up to town before night\nand going ashore, but the tide beginning to run strong against us,\nand the wind, what there was of it, being ahead, we made but little\nby weather-bowing the tide, and the pilot gave orders to cock-bill\nthe anchor and overhaul the chain.  Making two long stretches,\nwhich brought us into the roads, under the lee of the castle,\nhe clewed up the topsails, and let go the anchor; and for the\nfirst time since leaving San Diego,–one hundred and thirty-five\ndays–our anchor was upon bottom.  In half an hour more, we were\nlying snugly, with all sails furled, safe in Boston harbor;\nour long voyage ended; the well-known scene about us; the dome\nof the State House fading in the western sky; the lights of the\ncity starting into sight, as the darkness came on; and at nine\no’clock the clangor of the bells, ringing their accustomed peals;\namong which the Boston boys tried to distinguish the well-known\ntone of the Old South.",
        "We had just done furling the sails, when a beautiful little\npleasure-boat luffed up into the wind, under our quarter, and the\njunior partner of the firm to which our ship belonged, jumped on\nboard.  I saw him from the mizen topsail yard, and knew him well. ",
        "He shook the captain by the hand, and went down into the cabin,\nand in a few moments came up and inquired of the mate for me. ",
        "The last time I had seen him, I was in the uniform of an undergraduate\nof Harvard College, and now, to his astonishment, there came down\nfrom aloft a “rough alley” looking fellow, with duck trowsers and\nred shirt, long hair, and face burnt as black as an Indian’s.\nHe shook me by the hand, congratulated me upon my return and my\nappearance of health and strength, and said my friends were all\nwell.  I thanked him for telling me what I should not have dared\nto ask; and if–",
        "“the first bringer of unwelcome news\nHath but a losing office; and his tongue\nSounds ever after like a sullen bell–”",
        "certainly I shall ever remember this man and his words with\npleasure. ",
        "The captain went up to town in the boat with Mr. H––-, and left\nus to pass another night on board ship, and to come up with the\nmorning’s tide under command of the pilot. ",
        "So much did we feel ourselves to be already at home, in anticipation,\nthat our plain supper of hard bread and salt beef was barely touched;\nand many on board, to whom this was the first voyage, could scarcely\nsleep.  As for myself, by one of those anomalous changes of feeling\nof which we are all the subjects, I found that I was in a state\nof indifference, for which I could by no means account.  A year\nbefore, while carrying hides on the coast, the assurance that in a\ntwelvemonth we should see Boston, made me half wild; but now that I\nwas actually there, and in sight of home, the emotions which I had\nso long anticipated feeling, I did not find, and in their place\nwas a state of very nearly entire apathy.  Something of the same\nexperience was related to me by a sailor whose first voyage was\none of five years upon the North-west Coast.  He had left home,\na lad, and after several years of very hard and trying experience,\nfound himself homeward bound; and such was the excitement of his\nfeelings that, during the whole passage, he could talk and think\nof nothing else but his arrival, and how and when he should jump\nfrom the vessel and take his way directly home.  Yet when the vessel\nwas made fast to the wharf and the crew dismissed, he seemed suddenly\nto lose all feeling about the matter.  He told me that he went below\nand changed his dress; took some water from the scuttle-butt and\nwashed himself leisurely; overhauled his chest, and put his clothes\nall in order; took his pipe from its place, filled it, and sitting\ndown upon his chest, smoked it slowly for the last time.  Here he\nlooked round upon the forecastle in which he had spent so many\nyears, and being alone and his shipmates scattered, he began to\nfeel actually unhappy.  Home became almost a dream; and it was not\nuntil his brother (who had heard of the ship’s arrival) came down\ninto the forecastle and told him of things at home, and who were\nwaiting there to see him, that he could realize where he was, and\nfeel interest enough to put him in motion toward that place for\nwhich he had longed, and of which he had dreamed, for years.\nThere is probably so much of excitement in prolonged expectation,\nthat the quiet realizing of it produces a momentary stagnation of\nfeeling as well as of effort.  It was a good deal so with me.  The\nactivity of preparation, the rapid progress of the ship, the first\nmaking land, the coming up the harbor, and old scenes breaking upon\nthe view, produced a mental as well as bodily activity, from which\nthe change to a perfect stillness, when both expectation and the\nnecessity of labor failed, left a calmness, almost of indifference,\nfrom which I must be roused by some new excitement.  And the next\nmorning, when all hands were called, and we were busily at work,\nclearing the decks, and getting everything in readiness for going up\nto the wharves,–loading the guns for a salute, loosing the sails,\nand manning the windlass–mind and body seemed to wake together.",
        "About ten o’clock, a sea-breeze sprang up, and the pilot gave orders\nto get the ship under weigh.  All hands manned the windlass, and the\nlong-drawn “Yo, heave, ho!” which we had last heard dying away\namong the desolate hills of San Diego, soon brought the anchor to\nthe bows; and, with a fair wind and tide, a bright sunny morning,\nroyals and sky-sails set, ensign, streamer, signals, and pennant,\nflying, and with our guns firing, we came swiftly and handsomely\nup to the city.  Off the end of the wharf, we rounded-to and let\ngo our anchor; and no sooner was it on the bottom, than the decks\nwere filled with people: custom-house officers; Topliff’s agent,\nto inquire for news; others, inquiring for friends on board, or\nleft upon the coast; dealers in grease, besieging the galley to\nmake a bargain with the cook for his slush; “loafers” in general;\nand last and chief, boarding-house runners, to secure their men.",
        "Nothing can exceed the obliging disposition of these runners,\nand the interest they take in a sailor returned from a long voyage\nwith a plenty of money.  Two or three of them, at different times,\ntook me by the hand; remembered me perfectly; were quite sure I\nhad boarded with them before I sailed; were delighted to see me\nback; gave me their cards; had a hand-cart waiting on the wharf,\non purpose to take my things up: would lend me a hand to get my\nchest ashore; bring a bottle of grog on board if we did not haul\nin immediately,–and the like.  In fact, we could hardly get clear\nof them, to go aloft and furl the sails.  Sail after sail, for the\nhundredth time, in fair weather and in foul, we furled now for\nthe last time together, and came down and took the warp ashore,\nmanned the capstan, and with a chorus which waked up half the\nNorth End, and rang among the buildings in the dock, we hauled\nher in to the wharf.  Here, too, the landlords and runners were\nactive and ready, taking a bar to the capstan, lending a hand at\nthe ropes, laughing and talking and telling the news.  The city\nbells were just ringing one when the last turn was made fast,\nand the crew dismissed; and in five minutes more, not a soul\nwas left on board the good ship Alert, but the old ship-keeper,\nwho had come down from the counting-house to take charge of her.",
        "I trust that they who have followed me to the end of my narrative,\nwill not refuse to carry their attention a little farther, to the\nconcluding remarks which I here present to them.",
        "This chapter is written after the lapse of a considerable time since\nthe end of my voyage, and after a return to my former pursuits;\nand in it I design to offer those views of what may be done for\nseamen, and of what is already doing, which I have deduced from\nmy experiences, and from the attention which I have since gladly\ngiven to the subject.",
        "The romantic interest which many take in the sea, and in those\nwho live upon it, may be of use in exciting their attention to\nthis subject, though I cannot but feel sure that all who have\nfollowed me in my narrative must be convinced that the sailor has\nno romance in his every-day life to sustain him, but that it is\nvery much the same plain, matter-of-fact drudgery and hardship,\nwhich would be experienced on shore.  If I have not produced\nthis conviction, I have failed in persuading others of what my\nown experience has most fully impressed upon myself.",
        "There is a witchery in the sea, its songs and stories, and in the\nmere sight of a ship, and the sailor’s dress, especially to a young\nmind, which has done more to man navies, and fill merchantmen, than\nall the press-gangs of Europe.  I have known a young man with such\na passion for the sea, that the very creaking of a block stirred up\nhis imagination so that he could hardly keep his feet on dry ground;\nand many are the boys, in every seaport, who are drawn away, as by an\nalmost irresistible attraction, from their work and schools, and hang\nabout the decks and yards of vessels, with a fondness which, it is\nplain, will have its way.  No sooner, however, has the young sailor\nbegun his new life in earnest, than all this fine drapery falls off,\nand he learns that it is but work and hardship, after all.  This is\nthe true light in which a sailor’s life is to be viewed; and if\nin our books, and anniversary speeches, we would leave out much\nthat is said about “blue water,” “blue jackets,” “open hearts,\"\n\"seeing God’s hand on the deep,” and so forth, and take this up\nlike any other practical subject, I am quite sure we should do full\nas much for those we wish to benefit.  The question is, what can\nbe done for sailors, as they are,–men to be fed, and clothed,\nand lodged, for whom laws must be made and executed, and who are\nto be instructed in useful knowledge, and, above all, to be brought\nunder religious influence and restraint?  It is upon these topics\nthat I wish to make a few observations.",
        "In the first place, I have no fancies about equality on board ship,\nIt is a thing out of the question, and certainly, in the present\nstate of mankind, not to be desired.  I never knew a sailor who\nfound fault with the orders and ranks of the service; and if I\nexpected to pass the rest of my life before the mast, I would not\nwish to have the power of the captain diminished an iota.  It is\nabsolutely necessary that there should be one head and one voice,\nto control everything, and be responsible for everything.  There are\nemergencies which require the instant exercise of extreme power.\nThese emergencies do not allow of consultation; and they who would\nbe the captain’s constituted advisers might be the very men over\nwhom he would be called upon to exert his authority.  It has been\nfound necessary to vest in every government, even the most democratic,\nsome extraordinary, and, at first sight, alarming powers; trusting in\npublic opinion, and subsequent accountability to modify the exercise\nof them.  These are provided to meet exigencies, which all hope\nmay never occur, but which yet by possibility may occur, and if\nthey should, and there were no power to meet them instantly,\nthere would be an end put to the government at once.  So it is with\nthe authority of the shipmaster.  It will not answer to say that he\nshall never do this and that thing, because it does not seem always\nnecessary and advisable that it should be done.  He has great cares\nand responsibilities; is answerable for everything; and is subject\nto emergencies which perhaps no other man exercising authority\namong civilized people is subject to.  Let him, then, have powers\ncommensurate with his utmost possible need; only let him be held\nstrictly responsible for the exercise of them.  Any other course\nwould be injustice, as well as bad policy. ",
        "In the treatment of those under his authority, the captain\nis amenable to the common law, like any other person.  He is\nliable at common law for murder, assault and battery, and other\noffences; and in addition to this, there is a special statute of\nthe United States which makes a captain or other officer liable\nto imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, and to\na fine not exceeding a thousand dollars, for inflicting any\ncruel punishment upon, withholding food from, or in any other\nway maltreating a seaman.  This is the state of the law on the\nsubject; while the relation in which the parties stand, and the\npeculiar necessities, excuses, and provocations arising from\nthat relation, are merely circumstances to be considered in each\ncase.  As to the restraints upon the master’s exercise of power,\nthe laws themselves seem, on the whole, to be sufficient.  I do\nnot see that we are in need, at present, of more legislation on\nthe subject.  The difficulty lies rather in the administration\nof the laws; and this is certainly a matter that deserves great\nconsideration, and one of no little embarrassment.",
        "In the first place, the courts have said that public policy requires\nthe power of the master and officers should be sustained.  Many lives\nand a great amount of property are constantly in their hands, for which\nthey are strictly responsible.  To preserve these, and to deal justly\nby the captain, and not lay upon him a really fearful responsibility,\nand then tie up his hands, it is essential that discipline should\nbe supported.  In the second place, there is always great allowance\nto be made for false swearing and exaggeration by seamen, and for\ncombinations among them against their officers; and it is to be\nremembered that the latter have often no one to testify on their\nside.  These are weighty and true statements, and should not be lost\nsight of by the friends of seamen.  On the other hand, sailors make\nmany complaints, some of which are well founded.",
        "On the subject of testimony, seamen labor under a difficulty full as\ngreat as that of the captain.  It is a well-known fact, that they are\nusually much better treated when there are passengers on board. ",
        "The presence of passengers is a restraint upon the captain,\nnot only from his regard to their feelings and to the estimation\nin which they may hold him, but because he knows they will be\ninfluential witnesses against him if he is brought to trial.\nThough officers may sometimes be inclined to show themselves off\nbefore passengers, by freaks of office and authority, yet cruelty\nthey would hardly dare to be guilty of.  It is on long and distant\nvoyages, where there is no restraint upon the captain, and none\nbut the crew to testify against him, that sailors need most the\nprotection of the law.  On such voyages as these, there are many\ncases of outrageous cruelty on record, enough to make one heartsick,\nand almost disgusted with the sight of man; and many, many more,\nwhich have never come to light, and never will be known, until the\nsea shall give up its dead.  Many of these have led to mutiny and\npiracy,–stripe for stripe, and blood for blood.  If on voyages of\nthis description the testimony of seamen is not to be received in\nfavor of one another, or too great a deduction is made on account\nof their being seamen, their case is without remedy; and the captain,\nknowing this, will be strengthened in that disposition to tyrannize\nwhich the possession of absolute power, without the restraints of\nfriends and public opinion, is too apt to engender.",
        "It is to be considered, also, that the sailor comes into court\nunder very different circumstances from the master.  He is thrown\namong landlords, and sharks of all descriptions; is often led to\ndrink freely; and comes upon the stand unaided, and under a certain\ncloud of suspicion as to his character and veracity.  The captain,\non the other hand, is backed by the owners and insurers, and has\nan air of greater respectability; though, after all, he may have\nbut a little better education than the sailor, and sometimes,\n(especially among those engaged in certain voyages that I could\nmention) a very hackneyed conscience.",
        "These are the considerations most commonly brought up on the\nsubject of seamen’s evidence; and I think it cannot but be obvious\nto every one that here, positive legislation would be of no manner\nof use.  There can be no rule of law regulating the weight to be\ngiven to seamen’s evidence.  It must rest in the mind of the judge\nand jury; and no enactment or positive rule of court could vary the\nresult a hair, in any one case.  The effect of a sailor’s testimony\nin deciding a case must depend altogether upon the reputation of\nthe class to which he belongs, and upon the impression he himself\nproduces in court by his deportment, and by those infallible marks\nof character which always tell upon a jury.",
        "In fine, after all the well-meant and specious projects that have\nbeen brought forward, we seem driven back to the belief, that the\nbest means of securing a fair administration of the laws made for\nthe protection of seamen, and certainly the only means which can\ncreate any important change for the better, is the gradual one of\nraising the intellectual and religious character of the sailor,\nso that as an individual and as one of a class, he may, in the\nfirst instance, command the respect of his officers, and if any\ndifficulty should happen, may upon the stand carry that weight\nwhich an intelligent and respectable man of the lower class almost\nalways does with a jury.  I know there are many men who, when a\nfew cases of great hardship occur, and it is evident that there\nis an evil somewhere, think that some arrangement must be made,\nsome law passed, or some society got up, to set all right at once.\nOn this subject there can be no call for any such movement; on the\ncontrary, I fully believe that any public and strong action would\ndo harm, and that we must be satisfied to labor in the less easy\nand less exciting task of gradual improvement, and abide the issue\nof things working slowly together for good.",
        "Equally injudicious would be any interference with the economy\nof the ship.  The lodging, food, hours of sleep, etc., are all\nmatters which, though capable of many changes for the better,\nmust yet be left to regulate themselves.  And I am confident that\nthere will be, and that there is now a gradual improvement in all\nsuch particulars.  The forecastles of most of our ships are small,\nblack, and wet holes, which few landsmen would believe held a crew\nof ten or twelve men on a voyage of months or years; and often,\nindeed in most cases, the provisions are not good enough to make\na meal anything more than a necessary part of a day’s duty;(1)",
        "–––––––-\n1. I am not sure that I have stated, in the course of my narrative,\nthe manner in which sailors eat, on board ship.  There are neither\ntables, knives, forks, nor plates, in a forecastle; but the kid\n(a wooden tub, with iron hoops) is placed on the floor and the\ncrew sit round it, and each man cuts for himself with the common\njack-knife or sheath-knife, that he carries about him.  They drink\ntheir tea out of tin pots, holding little less than a quart each.",
        "These particulars are not looked upon as hardships, and, indeed,\nmay be considered matters of choice.  Sailors, in our merchantmen,\nfurnish their own eating utensils, as they do many of the instruments\nwhich they use in the ship’s work, such as knives, palms and needles,\nmarline-spikes, rubbers, etc. And considering their mode of life\nin other respects, the little time they would have for laying and\nclearing away a table with its apparatus, and the room it would take\nup in a forecastle, as well as the simple character of their meals,\nconsisting generally of only one piece of meat,–it is certainly\na convenient method, and, as the kid and pans are usually kept\nperfectly clean, a neat and simple one.  I had supposed these\nthings to be generally known, until I heard, a few months ago,\na lawyer of repute, who has had a good deal to do with marine\ncases, ask a sailor upon the stand whether the crew had “got up\nfrom table” when a certain thing happened.\n–––––––-",
        "and on the score of sleep, I fully believe that the lives of\nmerchant seamen are shortened by the want of it.  I do not refer\nto those occasions when it is necessarily broken in upon; but,\nfor months, during fine weather, in many merchantmen, all hands\nare kept, throughout the day, and, then, there are eight hours on\ndeck for one watch each night.  Thus it is usually the case that\nat the end of a voyage, where there has been the finest weather,\nand no disaster, the crew have a wearied and worn-out appearance.\nThey never sleep longer than four hours at a time, and are seldom\ncalled without being really in need of more rest.  There is no one\nthing that a sailor thinks more of as a luxury of life on shore,\nthan a whole night’s sleep.  Still, all these things must be left\nto be gradually modified by circumstances.",
        "Whenever hard cases occur, they should be made known, and masters\nand owners should be held answerable, and will, no doubt, in time,\nbe influenced in their arrangements and discipline by the increased\nconsideration in which sailors are held by the public.",
        "It is perfectly proper that the men should live in a different\npart of the vessel from the officers; and if the forecastle is made\nlarge and comfortable, there is no reason why the crew should not\nlive there as well as in any other part.  In fact, sailors prefer\nthe forecastle.  It is their accustomed place, and in it they are\nout of the sight and hearing of their officers.",
        "As to their food and sleep, there are laws, with heavy penalties,\nrequiring a certain amount of stores to be on board, and safely\nstowed; and, for depriving the crew unnecessarily of food or\nsleep, the captain is liable at common law, as well as under\nthe statute before referred to.  Farther than this, it would\nnot be safe to go.",
        "The captain must be the judge when it is necessary to keep his\ncrew from their sleep; and sometimes a retrenching, not of the\nnecessaries, but of some of the little niceties of their meals,\nas, for instance, duff on Sunday, may be a mode of punishment,\nthough I think generally an injudicious one.",
        "I could not do justice to this subject without noticing one part\nof the discipline of a ship, which has been very much discussed\nof late, and has brought out strong expressions of indignation from\nmany,–I mean the infliction of corporal punishment.  Those who have\nfollowed me in my narrative will remember that I was witness to an\nact of great cruelty inflicted upon my own shipmates; and indeed\nI can sincerely say that the simple mention of the word flogging,\nbrings up in me feelings which I can hardly control.  Yet, when the\nproposition is made to abolish it entirely and at once; to prohibit\nthe captain from ever, under any circumstances, inflicting corporal\npunishment; I am obliged to pause, and, I must say, to doubt\nexceedingly the expediency of making any positive enactment which\nshall have that effect.  If the design of those who are writing\non this subject is merely to draw public attention to it, and to\ndiscourage the practice of flogging, and bring it into disrepute,\nit is well; and, indeed, whatever may be the end they have in view,\nthe mere agitation of the question will have that effect, and,\nso far, must do good.  Yet I should not wish to take the command\nof a ship to-morrow, running my chance of a crew, as most masters\nmust, and know, and have my crew know, that I could not, under any\ncircumstances, inflict even moderate chastisement.  I should trust\nthat I might never have to resort to it; and, indeed, I scarcely\nknow what risk I would not run, and to what inconvenience I would\nnot subject myself, rather than do so.  Yet not to have the power of\nholding it up in terrorem, and indeed of protecting myself, and all\nunder my charge, by it, if some extreme case should arise, would be\na situation I should not wish to be placed in myself, or to take\nthe responsibility of placing another in.",
        "Indeed, the difficulties into which masters and officers are\nliable to be thrown, are not sufficiently considered by many\nwhose sympathies are easily excited by stories, frequent enough,\nand true enough of outrageous abuse of this power.  It is to\nbe remembered that more than three-fourths of the seamen in our\nmerchant vessels are foreigners.  They are from all parts of the\nworld.  A great many from the north of Europe, beside Frenchmen,\nSpaniards, Portuguese, Italians, men from all parts of the\nMediterranean, together with Lascars, Negroes, and, perhaps worst\nof all, the off-casts of British men-of-war, and men from our own\ncountry who have gone to sea because they could not be permitted\nto live on land.",
        "As things now are, many masters are obliged to sail without knowing\nanything of their crews, until they get out at sea.  There may be\npirates or mutineers among them; and one bad man will often infect\nall the rest; and it is almost certain that some of them will be\nignorant foreigners, hardly understanding a word of our language,\naccustomed all their lives to no influence but force, and perhaps\nnearly as familiar with the use of the knife as with that of the\nmarline-spike.  No prudent master, however peaceably inclined,\nwould go to sea without his pistols and handcuffs.  Even with\nsuch a crew as I have supposed, kindness and moderation would be\nthe best policy, and the duty of every conscientious man; and the\nadministering of corporal punishment might be dangerous, and of\ndoubtful use.  But the question is not, what a captain ought\ngenerally to do, but whether it shall be put out of the power of\nevery captain, under any circumstances, to make use of, even\nmoderate, chastisement.  As the law now stands, a parent may\ncorrect moderately his child, and the master his apprentice;\nand the case of the shipmaster has been placed upon the same\nprinciple.  The statutes, and the common law as expounded in the\ndecisions of courts, and in the books of commentators, are express\nand unanimous to this point, that the captain may inflict moderate\ncorporal chastisement, for a reasonable cause.  If the punishment\nis excessive, or the cause not sufficient to justify it, he is\nanswerable; and the jury are to determine, by their verdict in\neach case, whether, under all the circumstances, the punishment\nwas moderate, and for a justifiable cause.",
        "This seems to me to be as good a position as the whole subject\ncan be left in.  I mean to say, that no positive enactment, going\nbeyond this, is needed, or would be a benefit either to masters\nor men, in the present state of things.  This again would seem to\nbe a case which should be left to the gradual working of its own\ncure.  As seamen improve, punishment will become less necessary;\nand as the character of officers is raised, they will be less\nready to inflict it; and, still more, the infliction of it upon\nintelligent and respectable men, will be an enormity which will\nnot be tolerated by public opinion, and by juries, who are the\npulse of the body politic.  No one can have a greater abhorrence\nof the infliction of such punishment than I have, and a stronger\nconviction that severity is bad policy with a crew; yet I would\nask every reasonable man whether he had not better trust to the\npractice becoming unnecessary and disreputable; to the measure\nof moderate chastisement and a justifiable cause being better\nunderstood, and thus, the act becoming dangerous, and in course\nof time to be regarded as an unheard-of barbarity–than to take\nthe responsibility of prohibiting it, at once, in all cases,\nand in what ever degree, by positive enactment?",
        "There is, however, one point connected with the administration of\njustice to seamen, to which I wish seriously to call the attention\nof those interested in their behalf, and, if possible, also of\nsome of those concerned in that administration.  This is, the\npractice which prevails of making strong appeals to the jury in\nmitigation of damages, or to the judge, after a verdict has been\nrendered against a captain or officer, for a lenient sentence,\non the grounds of their previous good character, and of their\nbeing poor, and having friends and families depending upon them\nfor support.  These appeals have been allowed a weight which is\nalmost incredible, and which, I think, works a greater hardship\nupon seamen than any one other thing in the laws, or the execution\nof them.  Notwithstanding every advantage the captain has over the\nseaman in point of evidence, friends, money, and able counsel,\nit becomes apparent that he must fail in his defence.  An appeal\nis then made to the jury, if it is a civil action, or to the judge\nfor a mitigated sentence, if it is a criminal prosecution, on the two\ngrounds I have mentioned.  The same form is usually gone through in\nevery case.  In the first place, as to the previous good character of\nthe party.  Witnesses are brought from the town in which he resides,\nto testify to his good character, and to his unexceptionable conduct\nwhen on shore.  They say that he is a good father, or husband, or son,\nor neighbor, and that they never saw in him any signs of a cruel\nor tyrannical disposition.  I have even known evidence admitted\nto show the character he bore when a boy at school.  The owners\nof the vessel, and other merchants, and perhaps the president of\nthe insurance company, are then introduced; and they testify to\nhis correct deportment, express their confidence in his honesty,\nand say that they have never seen anything in his conduct to\njustify a suspicion of his being capable of cruelty or tyranny.\nThis evidence is then put together, and great stress is laid upon\nthe extreme respectability of those who give it.  They are the\ncompanions and neighbors of the captain, it is said,–men who know\nhim in his business and domestic relations, and who knew him in\nhis early youth.  They are also men of the highest standing in the\ncommunity, and who, as the captain’s employers, must be supposed\nto know his character.  This testimony is then contrasted with\nthat of some half dozen obscure sailors, who, the counsel will\nnot forget to add, are exasperated against the captain because\nhe has found it necessary to punish them moderately, and who\nhave combined against him, and if they have not fabricated a\nstory entirely, have at least so exaggerated it, that little\nconfidence can be placed in it.",
        "The next thing to be done is to show to the court and jury that the\ncaptain is a poor man, and has a wife and family, or other friends,\ndepending upon him for support; that if he is fined, it will only be\ntaking bread from the mouths of the innocent and helpless, and laying\na burden upon them which their whole lives will not be able to work\noff; and that if he is imprisoned, the confinement, to be sure,\nhe will have to bear, but the distress consequent upon the cutting\nhim off from his labor and means of earning his wages, will fall\nupon a poor wife and helpless children, or upon an infirm parent.\nThese two topics, well put, and urged home earnestly, seldom fail\nof their effect.",
        "In deprecation of this mode of proceeding, and in behalf of men\nwho I believe are every day wronged by it, I would urge a few\nconsiderations which seem to me to be conclusive. ",
        "First, as to the evidence of the good character the captain sustains\non shore.  It is to be remembered that masters of vessels have usually\nbeen brought up in a forecastle; and upon all men, and especially upon\nthose taken from lower situations, the conferring of absolute power is\ntoo apt to work a great change.  There are many captains whom I know\nto be cruel and tyrannical men at sea, who yet, among their friends,\nand in their families, have never lost the reputation they bore in\nchildhood.  In fact, the sea-captain is seldom at home, and when\nhe is, his stay is short, and during the continuance of it he is\nsurrounded by friends who treat him with kindness and consideration,\nand he has everything to please, and at the same time to restrain\nhim.  He would be a brute indeed, if, after an absence of months\nor years, during his short stay, so short that the novelty and\nexcitement of it has hardly time to wear off, and the attentions\nhe receives as a visitor and stranger hardly time to slacken,–if,\nunder such circumstances, a townsman or neighbor would be justified\nin testifying against his correct and peaceable deportment.  With\nthe owners of the vessel, also, to which he is attached, and among\nmerchants and insurers generally, he is a very different man from what\nhe may be at sea, when his own master, and the master of everybody\nand everything about him.  He knows that upon such men, and their\ngood opinion of him, he depends for his bread.  So far from their\ntestimony being of any value in determining what his conduct would\nbe at sea, one would expect that the master who would abuse and\nimpose upon a man under his power, would be the most compliant\nand deferential to his employers at home.",
        "As to the appeal made in the captain’s behalf on the ground of\nhis being poor and having persons depending upon his labor for\nsupport, the main and fatal objection to it is, that it will\ncover every case of the kind, and exempt nearly the whole body\nof masters and officers from the punishment the law has provided\nfor them.  There are very few, if any masters or other officers of\nmerchantmen in our country, who are not poor men, and having either\nparents, wives, children, or other relatives, depending mainly or\nwholly upon their exertions for support in life.  Few others follow\nthe sea for subsistence.  Now if this appeal is to have weight with\ncourts in diminishing the penalty the law would otherwise inflict,\nis not the whole class under a privilege which will, in a degree,\nprotect it in wrong-doing?  It is not a thing that happens now and\nthen.  It is the invariable appeal, the last resort, of counsel,\nwhen everything else has failed.  I have known cases of the most\nflagrant nature, where after every effort has been made for the\ncaptain, and yet a verdict rendered against him, and all other\nhope failed, this appeal has been urged, and with such success\nthat the punishment has been reduced to something little more\nthan nominal, the court not seeming to consider that it might be\nmade in almost every such case that could come before them.  It is\na little singular, too, that it seems to be confined to cases\nof shipmasters and officers.  No one ever heard of a sentence,\nfor an offence committed on shore, being reduced by the court\non the ground of the prisoner’s poverty, and the relation in\nwhich he may stand to third persons.  On the contrary, it had\nbeen thought that the certainty that disgrace and suffering will\nbe brought upon others as well as himself, is one of the chief\nrestraints upon the criminally disposed.  Besides, this course\nworks a peculiar hardship in the case of the sailor.  For if\npoverty is the point in question, the sailor is the poorer of the\ntwo; and if there is a man on earth who depends upon whole limbs\nand an unbroken spirit for support, it is the sailor.  He, too,\nhas friends to whom his hard earnings may be a relief, and whose\nhearts will bleed at any cruelty or indignity practised upon him.\nYet I never knew this side of the case to be once adverted to in\nthese arguments addressed to the leniency of the court, which are\nnow so much in vogue; and certainly they are never allowed a moment’s\nconsideration when a sailor is on trial for revolt, or for an injury\ndone to an officer.  Notwithstanding the many difficulties which\nlie in a seaman’s way in a court of justice, presuming that they\nwill be modified in time, there would be little to complain of,\nwere it not for these two appeals.",
        "It is no cause of complaint that the testimony of seamen against\ntheir officers is viewed with suspicion, and that great allowance is\nmade for combinations and exaggeration.  On the contrary, it is the\njudge’s duty to charge the jury on these points strongly.  But there\nis reason for objection, when, after a strict cross-examination of\nwitnesses, after the arguments of counsel, and the judge’s charge,\na verdict is found against the master, that the court should allow\nthe practice of hearing appeals to its lenity, supported solely by\nevidence of the captain’s good conduct when on shore, (especially\nwhere the case is one in which no evidence but that of sailors could\nhave been brought against the accused), and then, on this ground,\nand on the invariable claims of the wife and family, be induced\nto cut down essentially the penalty imposed by a statute made\nexpressly for masters and officers of merchantmen, and for no\none else.",
        "There are many particulars connected with the manning of vessels,\nthe provisions given to crews, and the treatment of them while at\nsea, upon which there might be a good deal said; but as I have,\nfor the most part, remarked upon them as they came up in the course\nof my narrative, I will offer nothing further now, except on the\nsingle point of the manner of shipping men.  This, it is well\nknown, is usually left entirely to the shipping-masters, and is\na cause of a great deal of difficulty, which might be remedied\nby the captain, or owner, if he has any knowledge of seamen,\nattending to it personally.  One of the members of the firm to\nwhich our ship belonged, Mr. S––-, had been himself a master of\na vessel, and generally selected the crew from a number sent down\nto him from the shipping-office.  In this way he almost always\nhad healthy, serviceable, and respectable men; for any one who\nhas seen much of sailors can tell pretty well at first sight,\nby a man’s dress, countenance, and deportment, what he would\nbe on board ship.  This same gentleman was also in the habit of\nseeing the crew together, and speaking to them previously to their\nsailing.  On the day before our ship sailed, while the crew were\ngetting their chests and clothes on board, he went down into the\nforecastle and spoke to them about the voyage, the clothing they\nwould need, the provision he had made for them, and saw that they\nhad a lamp and a few other conveniences.  If owners or masters\nwould more generally take the same pains, they would often save\ntheir crews a good deal of inconvenience, beside creating a sense\nof satisfaction and gratitude, which makes a voyage begin under\ngood auspices, and goes far toward keeping up a better state of\nfeeling throughout its continuance.",
        "It only remains for me now to speak of the associated public efforts\nwhich have been making of late years for the good of seamen: a far\nmore agreeable task than that of finding fault, even where fault\nthere is.  The exertions of the general association, called the\nAmerican Seamen’s Friend Society, and of the other smaller\nsocieties throughout the Union, have been a true blessing\nto the seaman; and bid fair, in course of time, to change the\nwhole nature of the circumstances in which he is placed, and give\nhim a new name, as well as a new character.  These associations\nhave taken hold in the right way, and aimed both at making the\nsailor’s life more comfortable and creditable, and at giving him\nspiritual instruction.  Connected with these efforts, the spread of\ntemperance among seamen, by means of societies, called, in their own\nnautical language, Windward-Anchor Societies, and the distribution\nof books; the establishment of Sailors’ Homes, where they can be\ncomfortably and cheaply boarded, live quietly and decently, and be\nin the way of religious services, reading and conversation; also the\ninstitution of Savings Banks for Seamen; the distribution of tracts\nand Bibles;–are all means which are silently doing a great work for\nthis class of men.  These societies make the religious instruction\nof seamen their prominent object.  If this is gained, there is no\nfear but that all other things necessary will be added unto them.\nA sailor never becomes interested in religion, without immediately\nlearning to read, if he did not know how before; and regular habits,\nforehandedness (if I may use the word) in worldly affairs, and hours\nreclaimed from indolence and vice, which follow in the wake of the\nconverted man, make it sure that he will instruct himself in the\nknowledge necessary and suitable to his calling.  The religious\nchange is the great object.  If this is secured, there is no fear\nbut that knowledge of things of the world will come in fast enough.\nWith the sailor, as with all other men in fact, the cultivation of the\nintellect, and the spread of what is commonly called useful knowledge,\nwhile religious instruction is neglected, is little else than changing\nan ignorant sinner into an intelligent and powerful one.  That sailor\nupon whom, of all others, the preaching of the Cross is least likely\nto have effect, is the one whose understanding has been cultivated,\nwhile his heart has been left to its own devices.  I fully believe that\nthose efforts which have their end in the intellectual cultivation of\nthe sailor; in giving him scientific knowledge; putting it in his\npower to read everything, without securing, first of all, a right\nheart which shall guide him in judgment; in giving him political\ninformation, and interesting him in newspapers;–an end in the\nfurtherance of which he is exhibited at ladies’ fairs and public\nmeetings, and complimented for his gallantry and generosity,–are\nall doing a harm which the labors of many faithful men cannot undo.",
        "The establishment of Bethels in most of our own seaports, and in\nmany foreign ports frequented by our vessels, where the gospel is\nregularly preached and the opening of “Sailors’ Homes,” which I have\nbefore mentioned, where there are usually religious services and other\ngood influences, are doing a vast deal in this cause.  But it is to be\nremembered that the sailor’s home is on the deep.  Nearly all his life\nmust be spent on board ship; and to secure a religious influence there,\nshould be the great object.  The distribution of Bibles and tracts\ninto cabins and forecastles, will do much toward this.  There is\nnothing which will gain a sailor’s attention sooner, and interest\nhim more deeply, than a tract, especially one which contains a\nstory.  It is difficult to engage their attention in mere essays\nand arguments, but the simplest and shortest story, in which home\nis spoken of, kind friends, a praying mother or sister, a sudden\ndeath, and the like, often touches the heart of the roughest and\nmost abandoned.  The Bible is to the sailor a sacred book.  It may\nlie in the bottom of his chest, voyage after voyage; but he never\ntreats it with positive disrespect.  I never knew but one sailor\nwho doubted its being the inspired word of God; and he was one\nwho had received an uncommonly good education, except that he had\nbeen brought up without any early religious influence.  The most\nabandoned man of our crew, one Sunday morning, asked one of the\nboys to lend him his Bible.  The boy said he would, but was afraid\nhe would make sport of it.  “No!” said the man, “I don’t make sport\nof God Almighty.”  This is a feeling general among sailors, and is\na good foundation for religious influence.",
        "A still greater gain is made whenever, by means of a captain who\nis interested in the eternal welfare of those under his command,\nthere can be secured the performance of regular religious exercises,\nand the exertion, on the side of religion, of that mighty influence which\na captain possesses for good, or for evil.  There are occurrences at sea\nwhich he may turn to great account,–a sudden death, the apprehension\nof danger, or the escape from it, and the like; and all the calls\nfor gratitude and faith.  Besides, this state of thing alters the\nwhole current of feeling between the crew and their commander.\nHis authority assumes more of the parental character; and kinder\nfeelings exist.  Godwin, though an infidel, in one of his novels,\ndescribing the relation in which a tutor stood to his pupil, says\nthat the conviction the tutor was under, that he and his ward were\nboth alike awaiting a state of eternal happiness or misery, and that\nthey must appear together before the same judgment-seat, operated so\nupon his naturally morose disposition, as to produce a feeling of\nkindness and tenderness toward his ward, which nothing else could\nhave caused.  Such must be the effect upon the relation of master\nand common seaman.",
        "There are now many vessels sailing under such auspices, in which\ngreat good is done.  Yet I never happened to fall in with one of\nthem.  I did not hear a prayer made, a chapter read in public,\nnor see anything approaching to a religious service, for two\nyears and a quarter.  There were, in the course of the voyage,\nmany incidents which made, for the time, serious impressions upon\nour minds, and which might have been turned to our good; but there\nbeing no one to use the opportunity, and no services, the regular\nreturn of which might have kept something of the feeling alive\nin us, the advantage of them was lost, to some, perhaps, forever.",
        "The good which a single religious captain may do can hardly be\ncalculated.  In the first place, as I have said, a kinder state\nof feeling exists on board the ship.  There is no profanity allowed;\nand the men are not called by any opprobrious names, which is a great\nthing with sailors.  The Sabbath is observed.  This gives the men a\nday of rest, even if they pass it in no other way.  Such a captain,\ntoo, will not allow a sailor on board his ship to remain unable to\nread his Bible and the books given to him; and will usually instruct\nthose who need it, in writing, arithmetic, and navigation; since he\nhas a good deal of time on his hands, which he can easily employ in\nsuch a manner.  He will also have regular religious services; and,\nin fact, by the power of his example, and, where it can judiciously\nbe done, by the exercise of his authority, will give a character\nto the ship and all on board.  In foreign ports, a ship is known\nby her captain; for, there being no general rules in the merchant\nservice, each master may adopt a plan of his own.  It is to be\nremembered, too, that there are, in most ships, boys of a tender\nage, whose characters for life are forming, as well as old men,\nwhose lives must be drawing toward a close.  The greater part of\nsailors die at sea; and when they find their end approaching,\nif it does not, as is often the case, come without warning,\nthey cannot, as on shore, send for a clergyman, or some religious\nfriend, to speak to them of that hope in a Saviour, which they\nhave neglected, if not despised, through life; but if the little\nhull does not contain such an one within its compass, they must\nbe left without human aid in their great extremity.  When such\ncommanders and such ships, as I have just described, shall become\nmore numerous, the hope of the friends of seamen will be greatly\nstrengthened; and it is encouraging to remember that the efforts\namong common sailors will soon raise up such a class; for those of\nthem who are brought under these influences will inevitably be the\nones to succeed to the places of trust and authority.  If there is\non earth an instance where a little leaven may leaven the whole\nlump, it is that of the religious shipmaster.",
        "It is to the progress of this work among seamen that we must look\nwith the greatest confidence for the remedying of those numerous\nminor evils and abuses that we so often hear of.  It will raise\nthe character of sailors, both as individuals and as a class.\nIt will give weight to their testimony in courts of justice,\nsecure better usage to them on board ship, and add comforts to\ntheir lives on shore and at sea.  There are some laws that can\nbe passed to remove temptation from their way and to help them\nin their progress; and some changes in the jurisdiction of the\nlower courts, to prevent delays, may, and probably will, be made.\nBut, generally speaking, more especially in things which concern\nthe discipline of ships, we had better labor in this great work,\nand view with caution the proposal of new laws and arbitrary\nregulations, remembering that most of those concerned in the\nmaking of them must necessarily be little qualified to judge\nof their operation.",
        "Without any formal dedication of my narrative to that body of men,\nof whose common life it is intended to be a picture, I have yet\nborne them constantly in mind during its preparation.  I cannot\nbut trust that those of them, into whose hands it may chance to\nfall, will find in it that which shall render any professions of\nsympathy and good wishes on my part unnecessary.  And I will take\nthe liberty, on parting with my reader, who has gone down with us\nto the ocean, and “laid his hand upon its mane,” to commend to his\nkind wishes, and to the benefit of his efforts, that class of men\nwith whom, for a time, my lot was cast.  I wish the rather to do\nthis, since I feel that whatever attention this book may gain,\nand whatever favor it may find, I shall owe almost entirely to\nthat interest in the sea, and those who follow it, which is so\neasily excited in us all.",
        "It was in the winter of 1835-6 that the ship Alert, in the prosecution\nof her voyage for hides on the remote and almost unknown coast\nof California, floated into the vast solitude of the Bay of San\nFrancisco.  All around was the stillness of nature.  One vessel,\na Russian, lay at anchor there, but during our whole stay not a\nsail came or went.  Our trade was with remote Missions, which sent\nhides to us in launches manned by their Indians.  Our anchorage was\nbetween a small island, called Yerba Buena, and a gravel beach\nin a little bight or cove of the same name, formed by two small\nprojecting points.  Beyond, to the westward of the landing-place,\nwere dreary sand-hills, with little grass to be seen, and few trees,\nand beyond them higher hills, steep and barren, their sides gullied\nby the rains.  Some five or six miles beyond the landing-place,\nto the right, was a ruinous Presidio, and some three or four miles\nto the left was the Mission of Dolores, as ruinous as the Presidio,\nalmost deserted, with but few Indians attached to it, and but little\nproperty in cattle.  Over a region far beyond our sight there were\nno other human habitations, except that an enterprising Yankee,\nyears in advance of his time, had put up, on the rising ground\nabove the landing, a shanty of rough boards, where he carried on\na very small retail trade between the hide ships and the Indians.\nVast banks of fog, invading us from the North Pacific, drove in\nthrough the entrance, and covered the whole bay; and when they\ndisappeared, we saw a few well-wooded islands, the sand-hills on\nthe west, the grassy and wooded slopes on the east, and the vast\nstretch of the bay to the southward, where we were told lay the\nMissions of Santa Clara and San José, and still longer stretches to\nthe northward and northeastward, where we understood smaller bays\nspread out, and large rivers poured in their tributes of waters.\nThere were no settlements on these bays or rivers, and the few\nranchos and Missions were remote and widely separated.  Not only\nthe neighborhood of our anchorage, but the entire region of the\ngreat bay, was a solitude.  On the whole coast of California there\nwas not a lighthouse, a beacon, or a buoy, and the charts were\nmade up from old and disconnected surveys by British, Russian,\nand Mexican voyagers.  Birds of prey and passage swooped and\ndived about us, wild beasts ranged through the oak groves, and as\nwe slowly floated out of the harbor with the tide, herds of deer\ncame to the water’s edge, on the northerly side of the entrance,\nto gaze at the strange spectacle.",
        "On the evening of Saturday, the 13th of August, 1859, the superb\nsteamship Golden Gate, gay with crowds of passengers, and lighting\nthe sea for miles around with the glare of her signal lights of red,\ngreen, and white, and brilliant with lighted saloons and staterooms,\nbound up from the Isthmus of Panama, neared the entrance to San\nFrancisco, the great centre of a world-wide commerce.  Miles out at\nsea, on the desolate rocks of the Farallones, gleamed the powerful\nrays of one of the most costly and effective light-houses in the\nworld.  As we drew in through the Golden Gate, another light-house\nmet our eyes, and in the clear moonlight of the unbroken California\nsummer we saw, on the right, a large fortification protecting the\nnarrow entrance, and just before us the little island of Alcatraz\nconfronted us,–one entire fortress.  We bore round the point toward\nthe old anchoring-ground of the hide ships, and there, covering the\nsand-hills and the valleys, stretching from the water’s edge to the\nbase of the great hills, and from the old Presidio to the Mission,\nflickering all over with the lamps of its streets and houses, lay a\ncity of one hundred thousand inhabitants.  Clocks tolled the hour\nof midnight from its steeples, but the city was alive from the salute\nof our guns, spreading the news that the fortnightly steamer had come,\nbringing mails and passengers from the Atlantic world.  Clipper ships\nof the largest size lay at anchor in the stream, or were girt to\nthe wharves; and capacious high-pressure steamers, as large and\nshowy as those of the Hudson or Mississippi, bodies of dazzling\nlight, awaited the delivery of our mails to take their courses up\nthe Bay, stopping at Benicia and the United States Naval Station,\nand then up the great tributaries–the Sacramento, San Joaquin,\nand Feather Rivers–to the far inland cities of Sacramento,\nStockton, and Marysville.",
        "The dock into which we drew, and the streets about it, were densely\ncrowded with express wagons and hand-carts to take luggage, coaches and\ncabs for passengers, and with men,–some looking out for friends among\nour hundreds of passengers,–agents of the press, and a greater\nmultitude eager for newspapers and verbal intelligence from the\ngreat Atlantic and European world.  Through this crowd I made\nmy way, along the well-built and well-lighted streets, as alive\nas by day, where boys in high-keyed voices were already crying\nthe latest New York papers; and between one and two o’clock in\nthe morning found myself comfortably abed in a commodious room,\nin the Oriental Hotel, which stood, as well as I could learn,\non the filled-up cove, and not far from the spot where we used\nto beach our boats from the Alert.",
        "Sunday, August 14th.  When I awoke in the morning, and looked from\nmy windows over the city of San Francisco, with its storehouses,\ntowers, and steeples; its court-houses, theatres, and hospitals; its\ndaily journals; its well-filled learned professions; its fortresses\nand light-houses; its wharves and harbor, with their thousand-ton\nclipper ships, more in number than London or Liverpool sheltered\nthat day, itself one of the capitals of the American Republic,\nand the sole emporium of a new world, the awakened Pacific; when I\nlooked across the bay to the eastward, and beheld a beautiful town\non the fertile, wooded shores of the Contra Costa, and steamers,\nlarge and small, the ferryboats to the Contra Costa, and capacious\nfreighters and passenger-carriers to all parts of the great bay and\nits tributaries, with lines of their smoke in the horizon,–when\nI saw all these things, and reflected on what I once was and saw\nhere, and what now surrounded me, I could scarcely keep my hold on\nreality at all, or the genuineness of anything, and seemed to myself\nlike one who had moved in “worlds not realized.”",
        "I could not complain that I had not a choice of places of worship.\nThe Roman Catholics have an archbishop, a cathedral, and five\nor six smaller churches, French, German, Spanish, and English;\nand the Episcopalians, a bishop, a cathedral, and three other\nchurches; the Methodists and Presbyterians have three or four\neach, and there are Congregationalists, Baptists, a Unitarian,\nand other societies.  On my way to church, I met two classmates\nof mine at Harvard standing in a door-way, one a lawyer and the\nother a teacher, and made appointments for a future meeting.  A\nlittle farther on I came upon another Harvard man, a fine scholar\nand wit, and full of cleverness and good-humor, who invited me to\ngo to breakfast with him at the French house–he was a bachelor,\nand a late riser on Sundays.  I asked him to show me the way to\nBishop Kip’s church.  He hesitated, looked a little confused,\nand admitted that he was not as well up in certain classes of\nknowledge as in others, but, by a desperate guess, pointed out\na wooden building at the foot of the street, which any one\nmight have seen could not be right, and which turned out to be\nan African Baptist meeting-house. But my friend had many capital\npoints of character, and I owed much of the pleasure of my visit\nto his attentions.",
        "The congregation at the Bishop’s church was precisely like one\nyou would meet in New York, Philadelphia, or Boston.  To be sure,\nthe identity of the service makes one feel at once at home, but the\npeople were alike, nearly all of the English race, though from all\nparts of the Union.  The latest French bonnets were at the head\nof the chief pews, and business men at the foot.  The music was\nwithout character, but there was an instructive sermon, and the\nchurch was full.",
        "I found that there were no services at any of the Protestant\nchurches in the afternoon.  They have two services on Sunday;\nat 11 A. M., and after dark.  The afternoon is spent at home,\nor in friendly visiting, or teaching of Sunday Schools, or other\nhumane and social duties.",
        "This is as much the practice with what at home are called the\nstrictest denominations as with any others.  Indeed, I found\nindividuals, as well as public bodies, affected in a marked\ndegree by a change of oceans and by California life.  One Sunday\nafternoon I was surprised at receiving the card of a man whom I\nhad last known, some fifteen years ago, as a strict and formal\ndeacon of a Congregational Society in New England.  He was a deacon\nstill, in San Francisco, a leader in all pious works, devoted to\nhis denomination and to total abstinence,–the same internally,\nbut externally–what a change!  Gone was the downcast eye, the\nbated breath, the solemn, non-natural voice, the watchful gait,\nstepping as if he felt responsible for the balance of the moral\nuniverse!  He walked with a stride, an uplifted open countenance,\nhis face covered with beard, whiskers, and mustache, his voice\nstrong and natural;–and, in short, he had put off the New\nEngland deacon and become a human being.  In a visit of an hour\nI learned much from him about the religious societies, the moral\nreforms, the “Dashaways,\"–total abstinence societies, which had\ntaken strong hold on the young and wilder parts of society,–and\nthen of the Vigilance Committee, of which he was a member, and of\nmore secular points of interest.",
        "In one of the parlors of the hotel, I saw a man of about sixty years\nof age, with his feet bandaged and resting in a chair, whom somebody\naddressed by the name of Lies.(1)  Lies! thought I, that must be the",

        "man who came across the country from Kentucky to Monterey while\nwe lay there in the Pilgrim in 1835, and made a passage in the\nAlert, when he used to shoot with his rifle bottles hung from the\ntop-gallant studding-sail-boom-ends.  He married the beautiful Doña\nRosalía Vallejo, sister of Don Guadalupe.  There were the old high\nfeatures and sandy hair.  I put my chair beside him, and began\nconversation, as any one may do in California.  Yes, he was the\nMr. Lies; and when I gave my name he professed at once to remember\nme, and spoke of my book.  I found that almost–I might perhaps say\nquite–every American in California had read it; for when California\n\"broke out,” as the phrase is, in 1848, and so large a portion of the\nAnglo-Saxon race flocked to it, there was no book upon California\nbut mine.  Many who were on the coast at the time the book refers\nto, and afterwards read it, and remembered the Pilgrim and Alert,\nthought they also remembered me.  But perhaps more did remember\nme than I was inclined at first to believe, for the novelty of a\ncollegian coming out before the mast had drawn more attention to\nme than I was aware of at the time.",
        "Late in the afternoon, as there were vespers at the Roman Catholic\nchurches, I went to that of Notre Dame des Victoires.  The congregation\nwas French, and a sermon in French was preached by an Abbé; the music\nwas excellent, all things airy and tasteful, and making one feel as if\nin one of the chapels in Paris.  The Cathedral of St. Mary, which I\nafterwards visited, where the Irish attend, was a contrast indeed,\nand more like one of our stifling Irish Catholic churches in Boston\nor New York, with intelligence in so small a proportion to the number\nof faces.  During the three Sundays I was in San Francisco, I visited\nthree of the Episcopal churches, and the Congregational, a Chinese\nMission Chapel, and on the Sabbath (Saturday) a Jewish synagogue.\nThe Jews are a wealthy and powerful class here.  The Chinese, too,\nare numerous, and do a great part of the manual labor and small\nshop-keeping, and have some wealthy mercantile houses.",
        "It is noticeable that European Continental fashions prevail generally\nin this city,–French cooking, lunch at noon, and dinner at the end\nof the day, with café noir after meals, and to a great extent the\nEuropean Sunday,–to all which emigrants from the United States and\nGreat Britain seem to adapt themselves.  Some dinners which were given\nto me at French restaurants were, it seemed to me,–a poor judge of\nsuch matters, to be sure,–as sumptuous and as good, in dishes and\nwines, as I have found in Paris.  But I had a relish-maker which my\nfriends at table did not suspect–the remembrance of the forecastle\ndinners I ate here twenty-four years before.",
        "August 17th.  The customs of California are free; and any person who\nknows about my book speaks to me.  The newspapers have announced the\narrival of the veteran pioneer of all.  I hardly walk out without\nmeeting or making acquaintances.  I have already been invited to\ndeliver the anniversary oration before the Pioneer Society, to\ncelebrate the settlement of San Francisco.  Any man is qualified\nfor election into the society who came to California before 1853.\nWhat moderns they are!  I tell them of the time when Richardson’s\nshanty of 1835–not his adobe house of 1836–was the only human\nhabitation between the Mission and the Presidio, and when the vast\nbay, with all its tributaries and recesses, was a solitude,–and\nyet I am but little past forty years of age.  They point out the\nplace where Richardson’s adobe house stood, and tell me that the\nfirst court and first town council were convened in it, the first\nProtestant worship performed in it, and in it the first capital\ntrial by the Vigilance Committee held.  I am taken down to\nthe wharves, by antiquaries of a ten or twelve years’ range,\nto identify the two points, now known as Clark’s and Rincon,\nwhich formed the little cove of Yerba Buena, where we used to\nbeach our boats,–now filled up and built upon.  The island we\ncalled “Wood Island,” where we spent the cold days and nights\nof December, in our launch, getting wood for our year’s supply,\nis clean shorn of trees; and the bare rocks of Alcatraz Island,\nan entire fortress.  I have looked at the city from the water\nand islands from the city, but I can see nothing that recalls the\ntimes gone by, except the venerable Mission, the ruinous Presidio,\nthe high hills in the rear of the town, and the great stretches of\nthe bay in all directions.",
        "To-day I took a California horse of the old style,–the run, the\nloping gait,–and visited the Presidio.  The walls stand as they\ndid, with some changes made to accommodate a small garrison of\nUnited States troops.  It has a noble situation, and I saw from\nit a clipper ship of the very largest class, coming through the\nGate, under her fore-and-aft sails.  Thence I rode to the Fort,\nnow nearly finished, on the southern shore of the Gate, and made an\ninspection of it.  It is very expensive and of the latest style.\nOne of the engineers here is Custis Lee, who has just left West\nPoint at the head of his class,–a son of Colonel Robert E. Lee,\nwho distinguished himself in the Mexican War.",
        "Another morning I ride to the Mission Dolores.  It has a strangely\nsolitary aspect, enhanced by its surroundings of the most uncongenial,\nrapidly growing modernisms; the hoar of ages surrounded by the\nbrightest, slightest, and rapidest of modern growths.  Its old\nbelfries still clanged with the discordant bells, and Mass was\nsaying within, for it is used as a place of worship for the\nextreme south part of the city.",
        "In one of my walks about the wharves, I found a pile of dry hides\nlying by the side of a vessel.  Here was something to feelingly\npersuade me what I had been, to recall a past scarce credible to\nmyself.  I stood lost in reflection.  What were these hides–what\nwere they not?–to us, to me, a boy, twenty-four years ago?\nThese were our constant labor, our chief object, our almost\nhabitual thought.  They brought us out here, they kept us here,\nand it was only by getting them that we could escape from the\ncoast and return to home and civilized life.  If it had not been\nthat I might be seen, I should have seized one, slung it over my\nhead, walked off with it, and thrown it by the old toss–I do not\nbelieve yet a lost art–to the ground.  How they called up to my\nmind the months of curing at San Diego, the year and more of beach\nand surf work, and the steering of the ship for home! I was in a\ndream of San Diego, San Pedro–with its hills so steep for taking\nup goods, and its stones so hard to our bare feet–and the cliffs\nof San Juan!  All this, too, is no more!  The entire hide-business\nis of the past, and to the present inhabitants of California a dim\ntradition.  The gold discoveries drew off all men from the gathering\nor cure of hides, the inflowing population made an end of the\ngreat droves of cattle; and now not a vessel pursues the–I was\nabout to say dear–the dreary once hated business of gathering\nhides upon the coast, and the beach of San Diego is abandoned and\nits hide-houses have disappeared.  Meeting a respectable-looking\ncitizen on the wharf, I inquired of him how the hide-trade was\ncarried on.  “O,” said he, “there is very little of it, and that\nis all here.  The few that are brought in are placed under\nsheds in winter, or left out on the wharf in summer, and are\nloaded from the wharves into the vessels alongside.  They form\nparts of cargoes of other materials.”  I really felt too much,\nat the instant, to express to him the cause of my interest in\nthe subject, and only added, “Then the old business of trading\nup and down the coast and curing hides for cargoes is all over?\"\n\"O yes, sir,” said he, “those old times of the Pilgrim and Alert\nand California, that we read about, are gone by.”",
        "Saturday, August 20th.  The steamer Senator makes regular trips up\nand down the coast, between San Francisco and San Diego, calling\nat intermediate ports.  This is my opportunity to revisit the\nold scenes.  She sails to-day, and I am off, steaming among the\ngreat clippers anchored in the harbor, and gliding rapidly round\nthe point, past Alcatraz Island, the light-house, and through the\nfortified Golden Gate, and bending to the southward,–all done in\ntwo or three hours, which, in the Alert, under canvas, with head\ntides, variable winds, and sweeping currents to deal with, took us\nfull two days.",
        "Among the passengers I noticed an elderly gentleman, thin, with\nsandy hair and face that seemed familiar.  He took off his glove\nand showed one shrivelled hand.  It must be he!  I went to him\nand said, “Captain Wilson, I believe.”  Yes, that was his name.\n\"I knew you, sir, when you commanded the Ayacucho on this coast,\nin old hide-droghing times, in 1835-6.”  He was quickened by this,\nand at once inquiries were made on each side, and we were in full talk\nabout the Pilgrim and Alert, Ayacucho and Loriotte, the California\nand Lagoda.  I found he had been very much flattered by the praise\nI had bestowed in my book on his seamanship, especially in bringing\nthe Pilgrim to her berth in San Diego harbor, after she had drifted\nsuccessively into the Lagoda and Loriotte, and was coming into him.\nI had made a pet of his brig, the Ayacucho, which pleased him almost\nas much as my remembrance of his bride and their wedding, which I\nsaw at Santa Barbara in 1836.  Doña Ramona was now the mother of\na large family, and Wilson assured me that if I would visit him\nat his rancho, near San Luis Obispo, I should find her still\na handsome woman, and very glad to see me.  How we walked the\ndeck together, hour after hour, talking over the old times,–the\nships, the captains, the crews, the traders on shore, the ladies,\nthe Missions, the south-easters! indeed, where could we stop?  He\nhad sold the Ayacucho in Chili for a vessel of war, and had given up\nthe sea, and had been for years a ranchero.  (I learned from others\nthat he had become one of the most wealthy and respectable farmers\nin the State, and that his rancho was well worth visiting.)  Thompson,\nhe said, hadn’t the sailor in him; and he never could laugh enough at\nhis fiasco in San Diego, and his reception by Bradshaw.  Faucon was a\nsailor and a navigator.  He did not know what had become of George\nMarsh (ante, pp. 199-202, 252), except that he left him in Callao;\nnor could he tell me anything of handsome Bill Jackson (ante,\np. 86), nor of Captain Nye of the Loriotte.  I told him all I\nthen knew of the ships, the masters, and the officers.  I found he\nhad kept some run of my history, and needed little information.\nOld Señor Noriego of Santa Barbara, he told me, was dead, and Don\nCarlos and Don Santiago, but I should find their children there,\nnow in middle life.  Doña Augustia, he said, I had made famous by\nmy praises of her beauty and dancing, and I should have from her a\nroyal reception.  She had been a widow, and remarried since, and had\na daughter as handsome as herself.  The descendants of Noriego had\ntaken the ancestral name of De la Guerra, as they were nobles of\nOld Spain by birth; and the boy Pablo, who used to make passages\nin the Alert, was now Don Pablo de la Guerra, a Senator in the\nState Legislature for Santa Barbara County.",
        "The points in the country, too, he noticed, as he passed them,\n–Santa Cruz, San Luis Obispo, Point Año Nuevo, the opening\nto Monterey, which to my disappointment we did not visit.\nNo; Monterey, the prettiest town on the coast, and its capital\nand seat of customs, had got no advantage from the great changes,\nwas out of the way of commerce and of the travel to the mines and\ngreat rivers, and was not worth stopping at.  Point Conception\nwe passed in the night, a cheery light gleaming over the waters\nfrom its tar light-house, standing on its outermost peak.  Point\nConception!  That word was enough to recall all our experiences\nand dreads of gales, swept decks, topmast carried away, and the\nhardships of a coast service in the winter.  But Captain Wilson\ntells me that the climate has altered; that the southeasters are\nno longer the bane of the coast they once were, and that vessels\nnow anchor inside the kelp at Santa Barbara and San Pedro all the\nyear round.  I should have thought this owing to his spending his\nwinters on a rancho instead of the deck of the Ayacucho, had not\nthe same thing been told me by others.",
        "Passing round Point Conception, and steering easterly, we opened\nthe islands that form, with the main-land, the canal of Santa\nBarbara.  There they are, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa; and there is the\nbeautiful point, Santa Buenaventura; and there lies Santa Barbara\non its plain, with its amphitheatre of high hills and distant\nmountains.  There is the old white Mission with its belfries,\nand there the town, with its one-story adobe houses, with here\nand there a two-story wooden house of later build; yet little is\nit altered,–the same repose in the golden sunlight and glorious\nclimate, sheltered by its hills; and then, more remindful than\nanything else, there roars and tumbles upon the beach the same\ngrand surf of the great Pacific as on the beautiful day when\nthe Pilgrim, after her five months’ voyage, dropped her weary\nanchors here; the same bright blue ocean, and the surf making\njust the same monotonous, melancholy roar, and the same dreamy\ntown, and gleaming white Mission, as when we beached our boats\nfor the first time, riding over the breakers with shouting Kanakas,\nthe three small hide-traders lying at anchor in the offing.  But now\nwe are the only vessel, and that an unromantic, sail-less, spar-less,\nengine-driven hulk!",
        "I landed in the surf, in the old style, but it was not high enough\nto excite us, the only change being that I was somehow unaccountably\na passenger, and did not have to jump overboard and steady the boat,\nand run her up by the gunwales.",
        "Santa Barbara has gained but little.  I should not know, from anything\nI saw, that she was now a seaport of the United States, a part of the\nenterprising Yankee nation, and not still a lifeless Mexican town.\nAt the same old house, where Señor Noriego lived, on the piazza in\nfront of the court-yard, where was the gay scene of the marriage\nof our agent, Mr. Robinson, to Doña Anita, where Don Juan Bandini\nand Doña Augustia danced, Don Pablo de la Guerra received me in a\ncourtly fashion.  I passed the day with the family, and in walking\nabout the place; and ate the old dinner with its accompaniments\nof frijoles, native olives and grapes, and native wines.  In due\ntime I paid my respects to Doña Augustia, and notwithstanding\nwhat Wilson told me, I could hardly believe that after twenty-\nfour years there would still be so much of the enchanting woman\nabout her.",
        "She thanked me for the kind and, as she called them, greatly exaggerated\ncompliments I had paid her; and her daughter told me that all travellers\nwho came to Santa Barbara called to see her mother, and that she herself\nnever expected to live long enough to be a belle.",
        "Mr. Alfred Robinson, our agent in 1835-6, was here, with a part of\nhis family.  I did not know how he would receive me, remembering\nwhat I had printed to the world about him at a time when I took\nlittle thought that the world was going to read it; but there was\nno sign of offence, only cordiality which gave him, as between us,\nrather the advantage in status.",
        "The people of this region are giving attention to sheep-raising,\nwine-making, and the raising of olives, just enough to keep the\ntown from going backwards. ",
        "But evening is drawing on, and our boat sails to-night.  So,\nrefusing a horse or carriage, I walk down, not unwilling to be a\nlittle early, that I may pace up and down the beach, looking off\nto the islands and the points, and watching the roaring, tumbling\nbillows.  How softening is the effect of time!  It touches us\nthrough the affections.  I almost feel as if I were lamenting the\npassing away of something loved and dear,–the boats, the Kanakas,\nthe hides, my old shipmates.  Death, change, distance, lend them\na character which makes them quite another thing from the vulgar,\nwearisome toil of uninteresting, forced manual labour.",
        "The breeze freshened as we stood out to sea, and the wild waves\nrolled over the red sun, on the broad horizon of the Pacific;\nbut it is summer, and in summer there can be no bad weather in\nCalifornia.  Every day is pleasant.  Nature forbids a drop of\nrain to fall by day or night, or a wind to excite itself beyond\na fresh summer breeze.",
        "The next morning we found ourselves at anchor in the Bay of\nSan Pedro.  Here was this hated, this thoroughly detested spot.\nAlthough we lay near, I could scarce recognize the hill up which\nwe rolled and dragged and pushed and carried our heavy loads,\nand down which we pitched the hides, to carry them barefooted\nover the rocks to the floating long-boat.  It was no longer\nthe landing-place.  One had been made at the head of the creek,\nand boats discharged and took off cargoes from a mole or wharf,\nin a quiet place, safe from southeasters.  A tug ran to take off\npassengers from the steamer to the wharf,–for the trade of Los\nAngeles is sufficient to support such a vessel.  I got the captain\nto land me privately, in a small boat, at the old place by the hill.\nI dismissed the boat, and, alone, found my way to the high ground.\nI say found my way, for neglect and weather had left but few\ntraces of the steep road the hide-vessels had built to the top.\nThe cliff off which we used to throw the hides, and where I spent\nnights watching them, was more easily found.  The population was\ndoubled, that is to say, there were two houses, instead of one,\non the hill.  I stood on the brow and looked out toward the offing,\nthe Santa Catalina Island, and, nearer, the melancholy Dead Man’s\nIsland, with its painful tradition, and recalled the gloomy days\nthat followed the flogging, and fancied the Pilgrim at anchor in\nthe offing.  But the tug is going toward our steamer, and I must\nawake and be off.  I walked along the shore to the new landing-place,\nwhere were two or three store-houses and other buildings, forming a\nsmall depot; and a stage-coach, I found, went daily between this place\nand the Pueblo.  I got a seat on the top of the coach, to which were\ntackled six little less than wild California horses.  Each horse had\na man at his head, and when the driver had got his reins in hand he\ngave the word, all the horses were let go at once, and away they\nwent on a spring, tearing over the ground, the driver only keeping\nthem from going the wrong way, for they had a wide, level pampa\nto run over the whole thirty miles to the Pueblo. This plain is\nalmost treeless, with no grass, at least none now in the drought\nof mid-summer, and is filled with squirrel-holes, and alive with\nsquirrels.  As we changed horses twice, we did not slacken our\nspeed until we turned into the streets of the Pueblo.",
        "The Pueblo de los Angeles I found a large and flourishing town of\nabout twenty thousand inhabitants, with brick sidewalks, and blocks\nof stone or brick houses.  The three principal traders when we\nwere here for hides in the Pilgrim and Alert are still among the\nchief traders of the place,–Stearns, Temple, and Warner, the two\nformer being reputed very rich.  I dined with Mr. Stearns, now a\nvery old man, and met there Don Juan Bandini, to whom I had given\na good deal of notice in my book.  From him, as indeed from every\none in this town, I met with the kindest attentions.  The wife of\nDon Juan, who was a beautiful young girl when we were on the coast,\nDoña Refugio, daughter of Don Santiago Argüello, the commandante\nof San Diego, was with him, and still handsome.  This is one of\nseveral instances I have noticed of the preserving quality of the\nCalifornia climate.  Here, too, was Henry Mellus, who came out with\nme before the mast in the Pilgrim, and left the brig to be agent’s\nclerk on shore.  He had experienced varying fortunes here, and was\nnow married to a Mexican lady, and had a family.  I dined with\nhim, and in the afternoon he drove me round to see the vineyards,\nthe chief objects in this region.  The vintage of last year was\nestimated at half a million of gallons.  Every year new square\nmiles of ground are laid down to vineyards, and the Pueblo promises\nto be the centre of one of the largest wine-producing regions in\nthe world.  Grapes are a drug here, and I found a great abundance\nof figs, olives, peaches, pears, and melons. The climate is well\nsuited to these fruits, but is too hot and dry for successful\nwheat crops.",
        "Towards evening, we started off in the stage coach, with again\nour relays of six mad horses, and reached the creek before dark,\nthough it was late at night before we got on board the steamer,\nwhich was slowly moving her wheels, under way for San Diego.",
        "As we skirted along the coast, Wilson and I recognized, or thought\nwe did, in the clear moonlight, the rude white Mission of San Juan\nCapistrano, and its cliff, from which I had swung down by a pair of\nhalyards to save a few hides,–a boy who could not be prudential,\nand who caught at every chance for adventure.",
        "As we made the high point off San Diego, Point Loma, we were\ngreeted by the cheering presence of a light-house.  As we swept\nround it in the early morning, there, before us, lay the little\nharbor of San Diego, its low spit of sand, where the water runs\nso deep; the opposite flats, where the Alert grounded in starting\nfor home; the low hills, without trees, and almost without brush;\nthe quiet little beach;–but the chief objects, the hide houses,\nmy eye looked for in vain.  They were gone, all, and left no mark\nbehind.",
        "I wished to be alone, so I let the other passengers go up to the\ntown, and was quietly pulled ashore in a boat, and left to myself. \nThe recollections and the emotions all were sad, and only sad.",
        "  Fugit, interea fugit irreparabile tempus.",
        "The past was real.  The present, all about me, was unreal,\nunnatural, repellant.  I saw the big ships lying in the stream,\nthe Alert, the California, the Rosa, with her Italians; then the\nhandsome Ayacucho, my favorite; the poor, dear old Pilgrim, the\nhome of hardship and hopelessness; the boats passing to and fro;\nthe cries of the sailors at the capstan or falls; the peopled\nbeach; the large hide-houses with their gangs of men; and the\nKanakas interspersed everywhere.  All, all were gone! not a\nvestige to mark where one hide-house stood.  The oven, too,\nwas gone.  I searched for its site, and found, where I thought\nit should be, a few broken bricks and bits of mortar.  I alone\nwas left of all, and how strangely was I here!  What changes to\nme!  Where were they all?  Why should I care for them,–poor\nKanakas and sailors, the refuse of civilization, the outlaws\nand beach-combers of the Pacific!  Time and death seemed to\ntransfigure them.  Doubtless nearly all were dead; but how had\nthey died, and where?  In hospitals, in fever-climes, in dens\nof vice, or falling from the mast, or dropping exhausted from\nthe wreck,–",
        "“When for a moment, like a drop of rain,\nHe sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,\nWithout a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.” ",
        "The light-hearted boys are now hardened middle-aged men, if the\nseas, rocks, fevers, and the deadlier enemies that beset a sailor’s\nlife on shore have spared them; and the then strong men have bowed\nthemselves, and the earth or sea has covered them.",
        "Even the animals are gone,–the colony of dogs, the broods of\npoultry, the useful horses; but the coyotes bark still in the\nwoods, for they belong not to man, and are not touched by his\nchanges.",
        "I walked slowly up the hill, finding my way among the few bushes,\nfor the path was long grown over, and sat down where we used to\nrest in carrying our burdens of wood, and to look out for vessels\nthat might, though so seldom, be coming down from the windward.",
        "To rally myself by calling to mind my own better fortune and nobler\nlot, and cherished surroundings at home, was impossible.  Borne down\nby depression, the day being yet at its noon, and the sun over the\nold point–it is four miles to the town, the Presidio,–I have walked\nit often, and can do it once more,–I passed the familiar objects,\nand it seemed to me that I remembered them better than those of any\nother place I had ever been in;–the opening to the little cave;\nthe low hills where we cut wood and killed rattlesnakes, and where\nour dogs chased the coyotes; and the black ground where so many\nof the ship’s crew and beach-combers used to bring up on their\nreturn at the end of a liberty day, and spend the night sub Jove.",
        "The little town of San Diego has undergone no change whatever that\nI can see.  It certainly has not grown.  It is still, like Santa\nBarbara, a Mexican town.  The four principal houses of the gente\nde razon–of the Bandinis, Estudillos, Argüellos, and Picos–are\nthe chief houses now; but all the gentlemen–and their families,\ntoo, I believe–are gone.  The big vulgar shop-keeper and trader,\nFitch, is long since dead; Tom Wrightington, who kept the rival\npulpería, fell from his horse when drunk, and was found nearly\neaten up by coyotes; and I can scarce find a person whom I remember.\nI went into a familiar one-story adobe house, with its piazza and\nearthen floor, inhabited by a respectable lower-class family by\nthe name of Muchado, and inquired if any of the family remained,\nwhen a bright-eyed middle-aged woman recognized me, for she had\nheard I was on board the steamer, and told me she had married a\nshipmate of mine, Jack Stewart, who went out as second mate the next\nvoyage, but left the ship and married and settled here.  She said he\nwished very much to see me.  In a few minutes he came in, and his\nsincere pleasure in meeting me was extremely grateful.  We talked\nover old times as long as I could afford to.  I was glad to hear\nthat he was sober and doing well.  Doña Tomasa Pico I found and\ntalked with.  She was the only person of the old upper class that\nremained on the spot, if I rightly recollect.  I found an American\nfamily here, with whom I dined,–Doyle and his wife, nice young\npeople, Doyle agent for the great line of coaches to run to the\nfrontier of the old States.",
        "I must complete my acts of pious remembrance, so I take a horse\nand make a run out to the old Mission, where Ben Stimson and I\nwent the first liberty day we had after we left Boston (ante,\np. 115).  All has gone to decay.  The buildings are unused and\nruinous, and the large gardens show now only wild cactuses, willows,\nand a few olive-trees.  A fast run brings me back in time to take\nleave of the few I knew and who knew me, and to reach the steamer\nbefore she sails.  A last look–yes, last for life–to the beach,\nthe hills, the low point, the distant town, as we round Point\nLoma and the first beams of the light-house strike out towards\nthe setting sun.",
        "Wednesday, August 24th.  At anchor at San Pedro by daylight.\nBut instead of being roused out of the forecastle to row the\nlong-boat ashore and bring off a load of hides before breakfast,\nwe were served with breakfast in the cabin, and again took our\ndrive with the wild horses to the Pueblo and spent the day;\nseeing nearly the same persons as before, and again getting back\nby dark.  We steamed again for Santa Barbara, where we only lay\nan hour, and passed through its canal and round Point Conception,\nstopping at San Luis Obispo to land my friend, as I may truly call\nhim after this long passage together, Captain Wilson, whose most\nearnest invitation to stop here and visit him at his rancho I was\nobliged to decline.",
        "Friday evening, 26th August, we entered the Golden Gate, passed the\nlight-houses and forts, and clipper ships at anchor, and came to our\ndock, with this great city, on its high hills and rising surfaces,\nbrilliant before us, and full of eager life.",
        "Making San Francisco my head-quarters, I paid visits to various\nparts of the State,–down the Bay to Santa Clara, with its live\noaks and sycamores, and its Jesuit College for boys; and San\nJosé, where is the best girls’ school in the State, kept by the\nSisters of Notre Dame,–a town now famous for a year’s session of\n\"The legislature of a thousand drinks,\"–and thence to the rich\nAlmaden quicksilver mines, returning on the Contra Costa side\nthrough the rich agricultural country, with its ranchos and the\nvast grants of the Castro and Soto families, where farming and\nfruit-raising are done on so large a scale.  Another excursion\nwas up the San Joaquin to Stockton, a town of some ten thousand\ninhabitants, a hundred miles from San Francisco, and crossing the\nTuolumne and Stanislaus and Merced, by the little Spanish town\nof Hornitos, and Snelling’s Tavern, at the ford of the Merced,\nwhere so many fatal fights are had.  Thence I went to Mariposa\nCounty, and Colonel Fremont’s mines, and made an interesting\nvisit to “the Colonel,” as he is called all over the country,\nand Mrs. Fremont, a heroine equal to either fortune, the salons\nof Paris and the drawing-rooms of New York and Washington, or the\nroughest life of the remote and wild mining regions of Mariposa,–with\ntheir fine family of spirited, clever children.  After a rest there,\nwe went on to Clark’s Camp and the Big Trees, where I measured one\ntree ninety-seven feet in circumference without its bark, and the\nbark is usually eighteen inches thick; and rode through another which\nlay on the ground, a shell, with all the insides out–rode through\nit mounted, and sitting at full height in the saddle; then to the\nwonderful Yo Semite Valley,–itself a stupendous miracle of nature,\nwith its Dome, its Capitan, its walls of three thousand feet of\nperpendicular height,–but a valley of streams, of waterfalls from\nthe torrent to the mere shimmer of a bridal veil, only enough to\nreflect a rainbow, with their plunges of twenty-five hundred feet,\nor their smaller falls of eight hundred, with nothing at the base\nbut thick mists, which form and trickle, and then run and at last\nplunge into the blue Merced that flows through the centre of the\nvalley.  Back by the Coulterville trail, the peaks of Sierra Nevada\nin sight, across the North Fork of the Merced, by Gentry’s Gulch,\nover hills and through cañons, to Fremont’s again, and thence to\nStockton and San Francisco–all this at the end of August, when\nthere has been no rain for four months, and the air is dear and\nvery hot, and the ground perfectly dry; windmills, to raise water for\nartificial irrigation of small patches, seen all over the landscape,\nwhile we travel through square miles of hot dust, where they tell\nus, and truly that in winter and early spring we should be up to\nour knees in flowers; a country, too, where surface gold-digging\nis so common and unnoticed that the large, six-horse stage-coach,\nin which I travelled from Stockton to Hornitos, turned off in the\nhigh road for a Chinaman, who, with his pan and washer, was working\nup a hole which an American had abandoned, but where the minute\nand patient industry of the Chinaman averaged a few dollars a day.",
        "These visits were so full of interest, with grandeurs and humors\nof all sorts, that I am strongly tempted to describe them.  But I\nremember that I am not to write a journal of a visit over the new\nCalifornia, but to sketch briefly the contrasts with the old spots\nof 1835-6, and I forbear.",
        "How strange and eventful has been the brief history of this\nmarvellous city, San Francisco!  In 1835 there was one board\nshanty.  In 1836, one adobe house on the same spot.  In 1847,\na population of four hundred and fifty persons, who organized a\ntown government.  Then came the auri sacra fames, the flocking\ntogether of many of the worst spirits of Christendom; a sudden\nbirth of a city of canvas and boards, entirely destroyed by fire\nfive times in eighteen months, with a loss of sixteen millions\nof dollars, and as often rebuilt, until it became a solid city\nof brick and stone, of nearly one hundred thousand inhabitants,\nwith all the accompaniments of wealth and culture, and now\n(in 1859) the most quiet and well-governed city of its size\nin the United States.  But it has been through its season of\nHeaven-defying crime, violence, and blood, from which it was\nrescued and handed back to soberness, morality, and good government,\nby that peculiar invention of Anglo-Saxon Republican America,\nthe solemn, awe-inspiring Vigilance Committee of the most grave\nand responsible citizens, the last resort of the thinking and the\ngood, taken to only when vice, fraud, and ruffianism have intrenched\nthemselves behind the forms of law, suffrage, and ballot, and there\nis no hope but in organized force, whose action must be instant and\nthorough, or its state will be worse than before.  A history of the\npassage of this city through those ordeals, and through its almost\nincredible financial extremes, should be written by a pen which\nnot only accuracy shall govern, but imagination shall inspire.",
        "I cannot pause for the civility of referring to the many kind\nattentions I received, and the society of educated men and women\nfrom all parts of the Union I met with; where New England,\nthe Carolinas, Virginia, and the new West sat side by side\nwith English, French, and German civilization.",
        "My stay in California was interrupted by an absence of nearly four\nmonths, when I sailed for the Sandwich Islands in the noble Boston\nclipper ship Mastiff, which was burned at sea to the water’s edge;\nwe escaping in boats, and carried by a friendly British bark into\nHonolulu, whence, after a deeply interesting visit of three months\nin that most fascinating group of islands, with its natural and its\nmoral wonders, I returned to San Francisco in an American whaler,\nand found myself again in my quarters on the morning of Sunday,\nDecember 11th, 1859.",
        "My first visit after my return was to Sacramento, a city of about\nforty thousand inhabitants, more than a hundred miles inland\nfrom San Francisco, on the Sacramento, where was the capital of\nthe State, and where were fleets of river steamers, and a large\ninland commerce.  Here I saw the inauguration of a Governor, Mr.\nLatham, a young man from Massachusetts, much my junior; and met a\nmember of the State Senate, a man who, as a carpenter, repaired\nmy father’s house at home some ten years before; and two more\nSenators from southern California, relics of another age,–Don\nAndres Pico, from San Diego; and Don Pablo de la Guerra, whom I\nhave mentioned as meeting at Santa Barbara.  I had a good deal of\nconversation with these gentlemen, who stood alone in an assembly\nof Americans, who had conquered their country, spared pillars of\nthe past.  Don Andres had fought us at San Pazqual and Sepulveda’s\nrancho, in 1846, and as he fought bravely, not a common thing among\nthe Mexicans, and, indeed, repulsed Kearney, is always treated with\nrespect.  He had the satisfaction, dear to the proud Spanish heart,\nof making a speech before a Senate of Americans, in favor of the\nretention in office of an officer of our army who was wounded at\nSan Pazqual and whom some wretched caucus was going to displace to\ncarry out a political job.  Don Andres’s magnanimity and indignation\ncarried the day.",
        "My last visit in this part of the country was to a new and\nrich farming region, the Napa Valley, the United States Navy\nYard at Mare Island, the river gold workings, and the Geysers,\nand old Mr. John Yount’s rancho.  On board the steamer, found Mr.\nEdward Stanley, formerly member of Congress from North Carolina,\nwho became my companion for the greater part of my trip.  I also\nmet–a revival on the spot of an acquaintance of twenty years\nago–Don Guadalupe Vallejo; I may say acquaintance, for although\nI was then before the mast, he knew my story, and, as he spoke\nEnglish well, used to hold many conversations with me, when in\nthe boat or on shore. He received me with true earnestness, and\nwould not hear of my passing his estate without visiting him.\nHe reminded me of a remark I made to him once, when pulling him\nashore in the boat, when he was commandante at the Presidio.\nI learned that the two Vallejos, Guadalupe and Salvador, owned,\nat an early time, nearly all Napa and Sonoma, having princely\nestates.  But they have not much left.  They were nearly ruined\nby their bargain with the State, that they would put up the public\nbuildings if the Capital should be placed at Vallejo, then a town\nof some promise. They spent $100,000, the Capital was moved there,\nand in two years removed to San José on another contract.  The town\nfell to pieces, and the houses, chiefly wooden, were taken down\nand removed. I accepted the old gentleman’s invitation so far as\nto stop at Vallejo to breakfast.",
        "The United States Navy Yard, at Mare Island, near Vallejo, is large\nand well placed, with deep fresh water.  The old Independence,\nand the sloop Decatur, and two steamers were there, and they\nwere experimenting on building a despatch boat, the Saginaw,\nof California timber.",
        "I have no excuse for attempting to describe my visit through the\nfertile and beautiful Napa Valley, nor even, what exceeded that\nin interest, my visit to old John Yount at his rancho, where I\nheard from his own lips some of his most interesting stories of\nhunting and trapping and Indian fighting, during an adventurous\nlife of forty years of such work, between our back settlements in\nMissouri and Arkansas, and the mountains of California, trapping in\nColorado and Gila,–and his celebrated dream, thrice repeated,\nwhich led him to organize a party to go out over the mountains,\nthat did actually rescue from death by starvation the wretched\nremnants of the Donner party.",
        "I must not pause for the dreary country of the Geysers, the screaming\nescapes of steam, the sulphur, the boiling caldrons of black and yellow\nand green, and the region of Gehenna, through which runs a quiet stream\nof pure water; nor for the park scenery, and captivating ranchos of\nthe Napa Valley, where farming is done on so grand a scale–where\nI have seen a man plough a furrow by little red flags on sticks,\nto keep his range by, until nearly out of sight, and where, the wits\ntell us, he returns the next day on the back furrow; a region where,\nat Christmas time, I have seen old strawberries still on the vines,\nby the side of vines in full blossom for the next crop, and grapes\nin the same stages, and open windows, and yet a grateful wood fire\non the hearth in early morning; nor for the titanic operations of\nhydraulic surface mining, where large mountain streams are diverted\nfrom their ancient beds, and made to do the work, beyond the reach\nof all other agents, of washing out valleys and carrying away hills,\nand changing the whole surface of the country, to expose the stores\nof gold hidden for centuries in the darkness of their earthly depths.",
        "January 10th, 1860.  I am again in San Francisco, and my revisit\nto California is closed.  I have touched too lightly and rapidly\nfor much impression upon the reader on my last visit into the\ninterior; but, as I have said, in a mere continuation to a narrative\nof a sea-faring life on the coast, I am only to carry the reader\nwith me on a visit to those scenes in which the public has long\nmanifested so gratifying an interest.  But it seemed to me that\nslight notices of these entirely new parts of the country would\nnot be out of place, for they serve to put in strong contrast with\nthe solitudes of 1835-6 the developed interior, with its mines,\nand agricultural wealth, and rapidly filling population, and its\nlarge cities, so far from the coast, with their education, religion,\narts, and trade.",
        "On the morning of the 11th January, 1860, I passed, for the eighth\ntime, through the Golden Gate, on my way across the delightful Pacific\nto the Oriental world, with its civilization three thousand years\nolder than that I was leaving behind.  As the shores of California\nfadcd in the distance, and the summits of the Coast Range sank\nunder the blue horizon, I bade farewell–yes, I do not doubt,\nforever–to those scenes which, however changed or unchanged,\nmust always possess an ineffable interest for me.",
        "It is time my fellow-travellers and I should part company.  But I\nhave been requested by a great many persons to give some account of\nthe subsequent history of the vessels and their crews, with which\nI had made them acquainted.  I attempt the following sketches in\ndeference to these suggestions, and not, I trust, with any undue\nestimate of the general interest my narrative may have created.",
        "Something less than a year after my return in the Alert, and when,\nmy eyes having recovered, I was again in college life, I found one\nmorning in the newspapers, among the arrivals of the day before,\n\"The brig Pilgrim, Faucon, from San Diego, California.”  In a\nfew hours I was down in Ann Street, and on my way to Hackstadt’s\nboarding-house, where I knew Tom Harris and others would lodge.\nEntering the front room, I heard my name called from amid a group\nof blue-jackets, and several sunburned, tar-colored men came forward\nto speak to me.  They were, at first, a little embarrassed by\nthe dress and style in which they had never seen me, and one of\nthem was calling me Mr. Dana; but I soon stopped that, and we\nwere shipmates once more. First, there was Tom Harris, in a\ncharacteristic occupation.  I had made him promise to come and\nsee me when we parted in San Diego; he had got a directory of\nBoston, found the street and number of my father’s house, and,\nby a study of the plan of the city, had laid out his course,\nand was committing it to memory.  He said he could go straight to\nthe house without asking a question.  And so he could, for I took\nthe book from him, and he gave his course, naming each street and\nturn to right or left, directly to the door.",
        "Tom had been second mate of the Pilgrim, and had laid up no mean\nsum of money.  True to his resolution, he was going to England to\nfind his mother, and he entered into the comparative advantages\nof taking his money home in gold or in bills,–a matter of some\nmoment, as this was in the disastrous financial year of 1837.\nHe seemed to have his ideas well arranged, but I took him to\na leading banker, whose advice he followed; and, declining my\ninvitation to go up and show himself to my friends, he was off\nfor New York that afternoon, to sail the next day for Liverpool.\nThe last I ever saw of Tom Harris was as he passed down Tremont\nStreet on the sidewalk, a man dragging a hand-cart in the street\nby his side, on which were his voyage-worn chest, his mattress,\nand a box of nautical instruments.",
        "Sam seemed to have got funny again, and he and John the Swede\nlearned that Captain Thompson had several months before sailed\nin command of a ship for the coast of Sumatra, and that their\nchance of proceedings against him at law was hopeless.  Sam was\nafterwards lost in a brig off the coast of Brazil, when all hands\nwent down.  Of John and the rest of the men I have never heard.\nThe Marblehead boy, Sam, turned out badly; and, although he had\ninfluential friends, never allowed them to improve his condition.\nThe old carpenter, the Fin, of whom the cook stood in such awe\n(ante p. 41), had fallen sick and died in Santa Barbara, and was\nburied ashore.  Jim Hall, from the Kennebec, who sailed with us\nbefore the mast, and was made second mate in Foster’s place,\ncame home chief mate of the Pilgrim.  I have often seen him\nsince.  His lot has been prosperous, as he well deserved it\nshould be.  He has commanded the largest ships, and when I\nlast saw him, was going to the Pacific coast of South America,\nto take charge of a line of mail steamers.  Poor, luckless Foster\nI have twice seen.  He came into my rooms in Boston, after I had\nbecome a barrister and my narrative had been published, and told\nme he was chief mate of a big ship; that he had heard I had said\nsome things unfavorable of him in my book; that he had just bought\nit, and was going to read it that night, and if I had said anything\nunfair of him, he would punish me if he found me in State Street.\nI surveyed him from head to foot, and said to him, “Foster, you were\nnot a formidable man when I last knew you, and I don’t believe you\nare now.”  Either he was of my opinion, or thought I had spoken of\nhim well enough, for the next (and last) time I met him he was civil\nand pleasant.",
        "I believe I omitted to state that Mr. Andrew B. Amerzene, the chief\nmate of the Pilgrim, an estimable, kind, and trustworthy man, had a\ndifficulty with Captain Faucon, who thought him slack, was turned\noff duty, and sent home with us in the Alert.  Captain Thompson,\ninstead of giving him the place of a mate off duty, put him into\nthe narrow between-decks, where a space, not over four feet high,\nhad been left out among the hides, and there compelled him to live\nthe whole wearisome voyage, through trades and tropics, and round\nCape Horn, with nothing to do,–not allowed to converse or walk\nwith the officers, and obliged to get his grub himself from the\ngalley, in the tin pot and kid of a common sailor.  I used to\ntalk with him as much as I had opportunity to, but his lot was\nwretched, and in every way wounding to his feelings.  After our\narrival, Captain Thompson was obliged to make him compensation\nfor this treatment.  It happens that I have never heard of him\nsince.",
        "Henry Mellus, who had been in a counting-house in Boston, and left\nthe forecastle, on the coast, to be agent’s clerk, and whom I met,\na married man, at Los Angeles in 1859, died at that place a few years\nago, not having been successful in commercial life.  Ben Stimson left\nthe sea for the fresh water and prairies, and settled in Detroit as\na merchant, and when I visited that city, in 1863, I was rejoiced to\nfind him a prosperous and respected man, and the same generous-hearted\nshipmate as ever.",
        "This ends the catalogue of the Pilgrim’s original crew, except\nher first master, Captain Thompson.  He was not employed by the\nsame firm again, and got up a voyage to the coast of Sumatra for\npepper.  A cousin and classmate of mine, Mr. Channing, went as\nsupercargo, not having consulted me as to the captain.  First,\nCaptain Thompson got into difficulties with another American vessel\non the coast, which charged him with having taken some advantage of\nher in getting pepper; and then with the natives, who accused him\nof having obtained too much pepper for his weights.  The natives\nseized him, one afternoon, as he landed in his boat, and demanded\nof him to sign an order on the supercargo for the Spanish dollars\nthat they said were due them, on pain of being imprisoned on shore.\nHe never failed in pluck, and now ordered his boat aboard, leaving\nhim ashore, the officer to tell the supercargo to obey no direction\nexcept under his hand.  For several successive days and nights,\nhis ship, the Alciope, lay in the burning sun, with rain-squalls\nand thunder-clouds coming over the high mountains, waiting for a\nword from him.  Toward evening of the fourth or fifth day he was\nseen on the beach, hailing for the boat.  The natives, finding they\ncould not force more money from him, were afraid to hold him longer,\nand had let him go.  He sprang into the boat, urged her off with the\nutmost eagerness, leaped on board the ship like a tiger, his eyes\nflashing and his face full of blood, ordered the anchor aweigh,\nand the topsails set, the four guns, two on a side, loaded with all\nsorts of devilish stuff, and wore her round, and, keeping as close\ninto the bamboo village as he could, gave them both broadsides,\nslam-bang into the midst of the houses and people, and stood out\nto sea!  As his excitement passed off, headache, languor, fever,\nset in,–the deadly coast-fever, contracted from the water and\nnight-dews on shore and his maddened temper.  He ordered the ship\nto Penang, and never saw the deck again.  He died on the passage,\nand was buried at sea.  Mr. Channing, who took care of him in his\nsickness and delirium, caught the fever from him, but, as we\ngratefully remember, did not die until the ship made port, and he was\nunder the kindly roof of a hospitable family in Penang.  The chief\nmate, also, took the fever, and the second mate and crew deserted;\nand although the chief mate recovered and took the ship to Europe\nand home, the voyage was a melancholy disaster.  In a tour I made\nround the world in 1859-1860, of which my revisit to California was\nthe beginning, I went to Penang.  In that fairy-like scene of sea\nand sky and shore, as beautiful as material earth can be, with its\nfruits and flowers of a perpetual summer,–somewhere in which still\nlurks the deadly fever,–I found the tomb of my kinsman, classmate,\nand friend.  Standing beside his grave, I tried not to think that\nhis life had been sacrificed to the faults and violence of another;\nI tried not to think too hardly of that other, who at least had\nsuffered in death.",
        "The dear old Pilgrim herself!  She was sold, at the end of this\nvoyage, to a merchant in New Hampshire, who employed her on short\nvoyages, and, after a few years, I read of her total loss at sea,\nby fire, off the coast of North Carolina.",
        "Captain Faucon, who took out the Alert, and brought home the\nPilgrim, spent many years in command of vessels in the Indian and\nChinese seas, and was in our volunteer navy during the late war,\ncommanding several large vessels in succession, on the blockade\nof the Carolinas, with the rank of lieutenant.  He has now given\nup the sea, but still keeps it under his eye, from the piazza of\nhis house on the most beautiful hill in the environs of Boston.\nI have the pleasure of meeting him often.  Once, in speaking of\nthe Alert’s crew, in a company of gentlemen, I heard him say that\nthat crew was exceptional: that he had passed all his life at sea,\nbut whether before the mast or abaft, whether officer or master,\nhe had never met such a crew, and never should expect to; and that\nthe two officers of the Alert, long ago shipmasters, agreed with\nhim that, for intelligence, knowledge of duty and willingness to\nperform it, pride in the ship, her appearance and sailing, and in\nabsolute reliableness, they never had seen their equal.  Especially he\nspoke of his favorite seaman, French John.  John, after a few more\nyears at sea, became a boatman, and kept his neat boat at the end of\nGranite Wharf, and was ready to take all, but delighted to take any\nof us of the old Alert’s crew, to sail down the harbor.  One day\nCaptain Faucon went to the end of the wharf to board a vessel in\nthe stream, and hailed for John.  There was no response, and his\nboat was not there.  He inquired of a boatman near, where John\nwas.  The time had come that comes to all!  There was no loyal\nvoice to respond to the familiar call, the hatches had closed\nover him, his boat was sold to another, and he had left not a\ntrace behind.  We could not find out even where he was buried.",
        "Mr. Richard Brown, of Marblehead, our chief mate in the Alert,\ncommanded many of our noblest ships in the European trade,\na general favorite.  A few years ago, while stepping on board\nhis ship from the wharf, he fell from the plank into the hold\nand was killed.  If he did not actually die at sea, at least\nhe died as a sailor,–he died on board ship.",
        "Our second mate, Evans, no one liked or cared for, and I know\nnothing of him, except that I once saw him in court, on trial\nfor some alleged petty tyranny towards his men,–still a subaltern\nofficer.",
        "The third mate, Mr. Hatch, a nephew of one of the owners, though only\na lad on board the ship, went out chief mate the next voyage, and rose\nsoon to command some of the finest clippers in the California and\nIndia trade, under the new order of things,–a man of character,\ngood judgment, and no little cultivation.",
        "Of the other men before the mast in the Alert, I know nothing of\npeculiar interest.  When visiting, with a party of ladies and\ngentlemen, one of our largest line-of-battle ships, we were\nescorted about the decks by a midshipman, who was explaining\nvarious matters on board, when one of the party came to me and\ntold me that there was an old sailor there with a whistle round\nhis neck, who looked at me and said of the officer, “he can’t show\nhim anything aboard a ship.”  I found him out, and, looking into\nhis sunburnt face, covered with hair, and his little eyes drawn\nup into the smallest passages for light,–like a man who had\npeered into hundreds of northeasters,–there was old “Sails\"\nof the Alert, clothed in all the honors of boatswain’s-mate.\nWe stood aside, out of the cun of the officers, and had a good\ntalk over old times.  I remember the contempt with which he turned\non his heel to conceal his face, when the midshipman (who was a\ngrown youth) could not tell the ladies the length of a fathom,\nand said it depended on circumstances.  Notwithstanding his advice\nand consolation to “Chips,” in the steerage of the Alert, and his\nstory of his runaway wife and the flag-bottomed chairs (ante, p.\n249), he confessed to me that he had tried marriage again, and had\na little tenement just outside the gate of the yard.",
        "Harry Bennett, the man who had the palsy, and was unfeelingly left\non shore when the Alert sailed, came home in the Pilgrim, and I had\nthe pleasure of helping to get him into the Massachusetts General\nHospital.  When he had been there about a week, I went to see him\nin his ward, and asked him how he got along.  “Oh! first-rate\nusage, sir; not a hand’s turn to do, and all your grub brought\nto you, sir.”  This is a sailor’s paradise,–not a hand’s turn\nto do, and all your grub brought to you.  But an earthly paradise\nmay pall.  Bennett got tired of in-doors and stillness, and was soon\nout again, and set up a stall, covered with canvas, at the end of one\nof the bridges, where he could see all the passers-by, and turn\na penny by cakes and ale.  The stall in time disappeared, and I\ncould learn nothing of his last end, if it has come.",
        "Of the lads who, beside myself, composed the gig’s crew, I know\nsomething of all but one.  Our bright-eyed, quick-witted little\ncockswain, from the Boston public schools, Harry May, or Harry Bluff,\nas he was called, with all his songs and gibes, went the road to ruin\nas fast as the usual means could carry him.  Nat, the “bucket-maker,\"\ngrave and sober, left the seas, and, I believe, is a hack-driver in\nhis native town, although I have not had the luck to see him since\nthe Alert hauled into her berth at the North End.",
        "One cold winter evening, a pull at the bell, and a woman in distress\nwished to see me.  Her poor son George,–George Somerby,–\"you\nremember him, sir; he was a boy in the Alert; he always talks\nof you,–he is dying in my poor house.”  I went with her, and in\na small room, with the most scanty furniture, upon a mattress on\nthe floor,–emaciated, ashy pale, with hollow voice and sunken\neyes,–lay the boy George, whom we took out a small, bright boy\nof fourteen from a Boston public school, who fought himself into\na position on board ship (ante, p. 231), and whom we brought home\na tall, athletic youth, that might have been the pride and support\nof his widowed mother.  There he lay, not over nineteen years of\nage, ruined by every vice a sailor’s life absorbs.  He took my\nhand in his wasted feeble fingers, and talked a little with his\nhollow, death-smitten voice.  I was to leave town the next day\nfor a fortnight’s absence, and whom had they to see to them?  The\nmother named her landlord,–she knew no one else able to do much\nfor them.  It was the name of a physician of wealth and high\nsocial position, well known in the city as the owner of many small\ntenements, and of whom hard things had been said as to his strictness\nin collecting what he thought his dues.  Be that as it may, my memory\nassociates him only with ready and active beneficence.  His name has\nsince been known the civilized world over, from his having been the\nvictim of one of the most painful tragedies in the records of the\ncriminal law.  I tried the experiment of calling upon him; and,\nhaving drawn him away from the cheerful fire, sofa, and curtains\nof a luxurious parlor, I told him the simple tale of woe, of one\nof his tenants, unknown to him even by name.  He did not hesitate;\nand I well remember how, in that biting, eager air, at a late hour,\nhe drew his cloak about his thin and bent form, and walked off\nwith me across the Common, and to the South End, nearly two miles\nof an exposed walk, to the scene of misery.  He gave his full\nshare, and more, of kindness and material aid; and, as George’s\nmother told me, on my return, had with medical aid and stores,\nand a clergyman, made the boy’s end as comfortable and hopeful\nas possible.",
        "The Alert made two more voyages to the coast of California,\nsuccessful, and without a mishap, as usual, and was sold by\nMessrs. Bryant and Sturgis, in 1843, to Mr. Thomas W. Williams,\na merchant of New London, Connecticut, who employed her in the\nwhale-trade in the Pacific.  She was as lucky and prosperous\nthere as in the merchant service.  When I was at the Sandwich\nIslands in 1860, a man was introduced to me as having commanded\nthe Alert on two cruises, and his friends told me that he was as\nproud of it as if he had commanded a frigate.",
        "I am permitted to publish the following letter from the owner of\nthe Alert, giving her later record and her historic end,–captured\nand burned by the rebel Alabama:–",
        "New London, March 17, 1868. ",
        "Richard H. Dana, Esq.:",
        "Dear Sir,–I am happy to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of\nthe 14th inst., and to answer your inquiries about the good ship\nAlert.  I bought her of Messrs. Bryant and Sturgis in the year\n1843, for my firm of Williams and Haven, for a whaler, in which\nbusiness she was successful until captured by the rebel steamer\nAlabama, September, 1862, making a period of more than nineteen\nyears, during which she took and delivered at New London upwards\nof twenty-five thousand barrels of whale and sperm oil.  She sailed\nlast from this port, August 30, 1862, for Hurd’s Island (the newly\ndiscovered land south of Kerguelen’s), commanded by Edwin Church,\nand was captured and burned on the 9th of September following,\nonly ten days out, near or close to the Azores, with thirty\nbarrels of sperm oil on board, and while her boats were off\nin pursuit of whales.",
        "The Alert was a favorite ship with all owners, officers, and men who\nhad anything to do with her; and I may add almost all who heard her\nname asked if that was the ship the man went in who wrote the book\ncalled “Two Years before the Mast\"; and thus we feel, with you,\nno doubt, a sort of sympathy at her loss, and that, too, in such\na manner, and by wicked acts of our own countrymen.",
        "My partner, Mr. Haven, sends me a note from the office this P. M.,\nsaying that he had just found the last log-book, and would send up\nthis evening a copy of the last entry on it; and if there should\nbe anything of importance I will enclose it to you, and if you\nhave any further inquiries to put, I will, with great pleasure,\nendeavor to answer them.",
        "Remaining very respectfully and truly yours,",
        "Thomas W. Williams.",
        "P. S.–Since writing the above I have received the extract from\nthe log-book, and enclose the same. ",
        "“September 9, 1862. ",
        "“Shortly after the ship came to the wind, with the main yard\naback, we went alongside and were hoisted up, when we found we\nwere prisoners of war, and our ship a prize to the Confederate\nsteamer Alabama.  We were then ordered to give up all nautical\ninstruments and letters appertaining to any of us.  Afterwards\nwe were offered the privilege, as they called it, of joining\nthe steamer or signing a parole of honor not to serve in the\narmy or navy of the United States.  Thank God no one accepted\nthe former of these offers.  We were all then ordered to get\nour things ready in haste, to go on shore,–the ship running\noff shore all the time.  We were allowed four boats to go on\nshore in, and when we had got what things we could take in them,\nwere ordered to get into the boats and pull for the shore,–the\nnearest land being about fourteen miles off,–which we reached\nin safety, and, shortly after, saw the ship in flames.",
        "“So end all our bright prospects, blasted by a gang of miscreants,\nwho certainly can have no regard for humanity so long as they continue\nto foster their so-called peculiar institution, which is now destroying\nour country.”",
        "I love to think that our noble ship, with her long record of\ngood service and uniform success, attractive and beloved in her\nlife, should have passed, at her death, into the lofty regions of\ninternational jurisprudence and debate, forming a part of the body\nof the “Alabama Claims\"; that, like a true ship, committed to her\nelement once for all at her launching, she perished at sea, and,\nwithout an extreme use of language, we may say, a victim in the\ncause of her country.",
