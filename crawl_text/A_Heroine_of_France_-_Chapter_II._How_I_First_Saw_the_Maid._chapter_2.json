        "I did not forget my desire to see this maiden of Domremy, nor did\nBertrand, I trow, forget the promise, albeit some days passed by\nere we put our plan into action.",
        "Bad news kept coming in to the little loyal township of\nVaucouleurs. There was no manner of doubt but that the English\nRegent, Bedford, was resolved to lose no more time, but seek to put\nbeneath his iron heel the whole of the realm of France. Gascony had\nbeen English so long that the people could remember nothing\ndifferent than the rule of the Roy Outremer–as of old they called\nhim. Now all France north of the Loire owned the same sway, and as\nall men know, the Duke of Burgundy was ally to the English, and\nhated the Dauphin with a deadly hatred, for the murder of his\nfather–for which no man can justly blame him. True, his love for\nthe English had cooled manifestly since that affair of Duke\nHumphrey of Gloucester and Jacquelaine of Brabant, in which as was\nnatural, he took the part of his brother; but although the Duke of\nBedford was highly indignant with Duke Humphrey, and gave him no\nmanner of support in his rash expedition, yet the Duke of Burgundy\nresented upon the English what had been done, and although it did\nnot drive him into the arms of the Dauphin, whom he hated worse, it\nloosened the bond between him and our foes, and we had hoped it\nmight bring about a better state of things for our party. Yet\nalas!–this seemed as far as ever from being so; and the Burgundian\nsoldiers still ravaged along our borders, and it seemed ofttimes as\nthough we little loyal community of the Duchy of Bar would be\nswallowed up altogether betwixt the two encroaching foes. So our\nhearts were often heavy and our faces grave with fear.",
        "I noted in the manner of the Governor, whose guest I had now\nbecome, a great gravity, which in old days had not been there; for\nRobert de Baudricourt, as I remembered him, had ever been a man of\nmerry mood, with a great laugh, a ready jest, and that sort of\nrough, bluff courage that makes light of trouble and peril.",
        "Now, however, we often saw him sunk in some deep reverie, his chin\nupon his hand, his eyes gazing full into the blaze of the leaping\nfire of logs, which always flamed upon the hearth in the great\nhall, where the most part of his time was spent. He would go\nhunting or hawking by day, or ride hither and thither through the\ntown, looking into matters there, or sit to listen to the affairs\nof the citizens or soldiers as they were brought before him; and at\nsuch times his manner would be much as it had ever been of\nyore–quick, almost rough, yet not unkindly–whilst the shrewd\njustice he always meted out won the respect of the people, and made\nhim a favourite in the town.",
        "But when the evening fell, and the day’s work was done, and after\nsupper we sat in the hall, with the dogs slumbering around us,\ntalking of any news which might have come in, either of raids by\nthe roving Burgundians, or the advance of the English towards\nOrleans, then these darker moods would fall upon him; and once when\nhe had sat for well-nigh an hour without moving, his brow drawn and\nfurrowed, and his eyes seemingly sunk deeper in his head, Bertrand\nleaned towards me and whispered in mine ear:",
        "“He is thinking of the Maid of Domremy!”",
        "De Baudricourt could not have heard the words, yet when he spoke a\nbrief while later, it almost seemed as though he might have done\nso.",
        "“Nephew,” he said, lifting his head abruptly and gazing across at\nus, “tell me again the words of that prophecy of Merlin’s, spoken\nlong, long ago, of which men whisper in these days, and of which\nyou did speak to me awhile back.”",
        "“Marry, good mine uncle, the prophecy runs thus,” answered\nBertrand, rising and crossing over towards the great fire before\nwhich his kinsman sat, “’That France should be destroyed by the\nwiles of a woman, and saved and redeemed by a maiden.’”",
        "The bushy brows met in a fierce scowl over the burning eyes; his\nwords came in a great burst of indignation and scorn.",
        "“Ay, truly–he spake truly–the wise man–the wizard! A woman to be\nthe ruin of the kingdom! Ay, verily, and has it not been so? Who\nbut that wicked Queen Isabeau is at the bottom of the disgraceful\nTreaty of Troyes, wherein France sold herself into the hands of the\nEnglish? Did she not repudiate her own son? Did not her hatred burn\nso fiercely against him that she was ready to tarnish her own good\nfame and declare him illegitimate, rather than that he should\nsucceed his father as King of France? Did she not give her daughter\nto the English King in wedlock, that their child might reign over\nthis fair realm? Truly has the kingdom been destroyed by the wiles\nof a woman! But I vow it will take more than the strength of any\nmaiden to save and redeem it from the woes beneath which it lies\ncrushed!”",
        "“In sooth it doth seem so,” answered Bertrand with grave and\nearnest countenance, “but yet with the good God nothing is\nimpossible. Hath He not said before this that He doth take of the\nmean and humble to confound the great of the earth? Did not the\nthree hundred with Gideon overcome the hosts of the Moabites? Did\nnot the cake of barley bread overturn the tent and the camp of the\nfoe?”",
        "“Ay, if the good God will arise to work miracles again, such things\nmight be; but how can we look for Him to do so? What manner of man\nis the Dauphin of France that he should look for divine\ndeliverance? ’God helps those who help themselves,’ so says the\nproverb; but what of those who lie sunk in lethargy or despair, and\nseek to drown thought or care in folly and riotous living–heedless\nof the ruin of the realm?”",
        "“There is another proverb, good mine uncle, that tells how man’s\nextremity is God’s opportunity,” quoth Bertrand thoughtfully; “if\nwe did judge of God’s mercy by man’s worthiness to receive the\nsame, we might well sink in despair. But His power and His goodness\nare not limited by our infirmities, and therein alone lies our\nhope.”",
        "De Baudricourt uttered a sound between a snort and a grunt. I knew\nnot what he thought of Bertrand’s answer; but that brief dialogue\naroused within me afresh the desire I had before expressed to see\nthe maid, Jeanne of Domremy; and as the sun upon the morrow shone\nout bright and clear, after a week of heavy rain storms, we agreed\nthat no better opportunity could we hope for to ride across to the\nlittle village, and try whether it were possible to obtain speech\nwith the young girl about whom such interest had been aroused in\nsome breasts.",
        "We spoke no word to De Baudricourt of our intention. Bertrand knew\nfrom his manner that he was thinking more and more earnestly of\nthat declaration on the part of the village maiden that her\nLord–the King of Heaven–had revealed to her that she must be sent\nto the Dauphin, to help him to drive out the English from his\ncountry, and to place the crown of France upon his head, and that\nhe, Robert de Baudricourt, was the instrument who would be used to\nspeed her on her way. Bertrand knew that this thought was weighing\nupon the mind of his kinsman, and the more so as the time for the\nfulfilment of the prophecy drew nearer.",
        "Autumn had come. Winter was hard at hand; and before Mid-Lent the\npromised succour to France was to arrive through the means of this\nmaiden–this Jeanne d’Arc.",
        "“He is waiting and watching,” spoke Bertrand, as we rode through\nthe forest, the thinning leaves of which allowed the sunlight to\nplay merrily upon our path. “He says in his heart that if this\nthing be of God, the Maid will come again when the time draws near;\nbut that if it is phantasy, or if she be deluded of the Devil,\nperchance his backwardness will put a check upon her ardour, and we\nshall hear no more of it. The Abbe Perigord, his Confessor, has\nbidden him beware lest it be a snare of the Evil One\"–and as he\nspoke these words Bertrand crossed himself, and I did the like, for\nthe forest is an ill place in which to talk of the Devil, as all\nmen know.",
        "“But for my part, when I think upon her words, and see again the\nlook of her young face, I cannot believe that she has been thus\ndeceived; albeit we are told that the Devil can make himself appear\nas an angel of light.”",
        "This was the puzzle, of course. But surely the Church had power to\ndiscern betwixt the wiles of the Evil One and the finger of God.\nThere were words and signs which any possessed of the Devil must\nneeds fly before. I could not think that the Church need fear\ndeception, even though a village maid might be deceived.",
        "The forest was very beautiful that day, albeit travelling was\nsomething slow, owing to the softness of the ground, and the\nswollen condition of the brooks, which often forced us to go round\nby the bridges instead of taking the fords; so that we halted a few\nmiles from Domremy to bait our horses and to appease our own\nhunger, for by that time our appetite was sharp set.",
        "It was there, as we sat at table, and talked with mine host, that\nwe heard somewhat more of this Maid, whom we had started forth in\nhopes to see.",
        "Bertrand was known for the kinsman of De Baudricourt and all the\ncountryside knew well the tale, how that Jeanne d’Arc had gone to\nhim in the springtide of the year, demanding an escort to the\nDauphin King of France, for whom she had a message from the King of\nHeaven, and whom she was to set upon his throne.",
        "“When she came home again, having accomplished nothing,” spoke the\ninnkeeper, leaning his hands upon the table and greatly enjoying\nthe sound of his own voice, “all the village made great mock of\nher! They called her the King’s Marshal, the Little Queen, Jeanne\nthe Prophetess, and I know not what beside. Her father was right\nwroth with her. Long ago he had a dream about her, which troubled\nhim somewhat, as he seemed to see his daughter in the midst of\nfighting men, leading them on to battle.”",
        "“Did he dream that? Surely that is something strange for the vision\nof a village prud’homme anent his little daughter.”",
        "“Ay truly, though at the time he thought little of it, but when all\nthis came to pass he recalled it again; and he smote Jeanne upon\nthe ear with his open hand, and bid her return to her needle and\nher household tasks, and think no more of matters too great for\nher. Moreover, he declared that if ever she were to disgrace\nherself by mingling with men-at-arms, he would call upon her\nbrothers to drown her, and if they disobeyed him, he would take and\ndo it with his own hands!”",
        "“A Spartan father, truly!” murmured Bertrand.",
        "“O ay–but he is a very honest man, is Jacques d’Arc; and he was\nvery wroth at all the talk about his daughter, and he vowed she\nshould wed an honest man, as she is now of age to do, and so forget\nher dreams and her visions, and take care of her house and her\nhusband and the children the good God should send them–like other\nwedded wives.”",
        "“Then has she indeed wedded?” asked Bertrand earnestly.",
        "“Ah, that is another story!” answered our host, wagging his head\nand spreading out his hands. “It would take too long were I to tell\nyou all, messires; but so much will I tell. They did find a man who\nhad long desired the pretty Jeanne for his wife, and he did\nforswear himself and vow that he had been betrothed to Jeanne with\nher own free will and consent, and that now he claimed her as his\nwife. Jeanne, whose courage is high, though she be so quiet and\nmodest in her daily life, did vehemently deny the charge, whereupon\nthe angry father and his friend, the claimant of her hand, did\nbring it into the court, and the Maid had to defend herself there\nfrom the accusation of broken faith. But by St. Michael and all his\nangels!–how she did confound them all! She asked no help from\nlawyers, though one did offer himself to her. She called no\nwitnesses herself; but she questioned the witnesses brought against\nher, and also the man who would fain have become her lord, and out\nof their own mouths did she convict them of lying and hypocrisy and\nconspiracy, so that she was triumphantly acquitted, and her judges\ncalled her a most wonderful child, and told her mother to be proud\nof such a daughter!”",
        "I saw a flush rise to Bertrand’s cheek, a flush as of pride and\njoy. And indeed, I myself rejoiced to hear the end of the tale; for\nit did seem as though this maiden had been persecuted with rancour\nand injustice, and that is a thing which no man can quietly endure\nto hear or see.",
        "“And how have they of Domremy behaved themselves to her since?” I\nasked; and Bertrand listened eagerly for the answer.",
        "“Oh, they have taken her to favour once more; her father has been\nkind again; her mother ever loved Jeanne much, for her gentleness\nand beauty and helpfulness at home. All the people love her, when\nnot stirred to mockery by such fine pretensions. If she will remain\nquietly at home like a wise and discreet maiden, no one will long\nremember against her her foolish words and dreams.”",
        "As we rode through the fields and woodlands towards Domremy, the\nlight began to take the golden hue which it does upon the autumn\nafternoon, and upon that day it shone with a wonderful radiance\nsuch as is not uncommon after rain. We were later than we had\nmeant, but there would be a moon to light us when the sun sank, and\nboth we and our horses knew the roads well; or we could even sleep,\nif we were so minded, at the auberge where we had dined. So we were\nin no haste or hurry. We picked our way leisurely towards the\nvillage, and Bertrand told me of the Fairy Well and the Fairy Tree\nin the forest hard by, so beloved of the children of Domremy, and\nof which so much has been heard of late, though at that time I knew\nnothing of any such things.",
        "But fairy lore has ever a charm for me, and I bid him show me these\nsame things. So we turned a little aside into the forest, and found\nourselves in a lovely glade, where the light shone so soft and\ngolden, and where the songs of the birds sounded so sweet and\nmelodious, that I felt as though we were stepping through an\nenchanted world, and well could I believe that the fairies danced\naround the well, sunk deep in its mossy dell, and fringed about\nwith ferns and flowers and the shade of drooping trees.",
        "But fairies there were none visible to our eyes, and we moved\nsoftly onwards towards the spreading tree hard by. But ere we\nreached it, we both drew rein as by a common impulse, for we had\nseen a sight which arrested and held us spellbound, ay, and more\nthan that, for the wonder and amaze of it fell also upon the horses\nwe bestrode. For scarcely had we drawn rein, before they both began\nto tremble and to sweat, and stood with their forefeet planted,\ntheir necks outstretched, their nostrils distended; uttering short,\ngasping, snorting sounds, as a horse will do when overcome by some\nterror. But for all this they were as rigid as if they had been\ncarved in stone.",
        "And now, what did we see? Let me try and tell, so far as my poor\nwords may avail. Beneath a spreading tree just a stone’s throw to\nthe right of where we stood, and with nothing between to hinder our\nview of her, a peasant maiden, dressed in the white coif, red\nskirt, and jacket and kerchief of her class, had been bending over\nsome fine embroidery which she held in her hands. We just caught a\nglimpse of her thus before the strange thing happened which caused\nus to stop short, as though some power from without restrained us.",
        "Hard by, as I know now, stood the village, shut out from view by\nthe trees, with its little church, and the homestead of Jacques\nd’Arc nestling almost within its shadow. At the moment of which I\nspeak the bell rang forth for the Angelus, with a full, sweet tone\nof silvery melody; and at the very same instant the work dropped\nfrom the girl’s hands, and she sank upon her knees. At the first\nmoment, although instinctively, we reined back our horses and\nuncovered our heads, I had no thought but that she was a devout\nmaiden following the office of the Church out here in the wood. But\nas she turned her upraised face a little towards us, I saw upon it\nsuch a look as I have never seen on human countenance before, nor\nhave ever seen (save upon hers) since. A light seemed to shine\neither from it or upon it–how can I tell which?–a light so pure\nand heavenly that no words can fully describe it, but which seemed\nlike the radiance of heaven itself. Her eyes were raised towards\nthe sky, her lips parted, and through the breathless hush of\nsilence which had fallen upon the wood, we heard the soft, sweet\ntones of her voice.",
        "“Speak, my Lord–Thy servant heareth!”",
        "It was then that our horses showed the signs of terror of which I\nhave before spoken. For myself, I saw nothing save the shining face\nof the Maid–I knew who it was–there was no need for Bertrand’s\nbreathless whisper–\"It is she–herself!\"–I knew it in my heart\nbefore.",
        "She knelt there amid the fallen leaves, her face raised, her lips\nparted, her eyes shining as surely never human eyes have shone\nbefore. A deep strange hush had fallen over all nature, broken only\nby the gentle music of the bell. The ruddy gold light of\napproaching sunset bathed all the wood in glory, and the rays fell\nupon the kneeling figure, forming a halo of glory round it. But she\ndid not heed, she did not see. She was as one in a trance,\ninsensible to outward vision. Once and again her lips moved, but we\nheard no word proceed from them, only the rapt look upon her face\nincreased in intensity, and once I thought (for I could not turn my\ngaze away) that I saw the gleam of tears in her eyes.",
        "The bell ceased as we stood thus motionless, and as the last note\nvibrated through the still air, a change came over the Maid. Her\nhead drooped, she hid her face in her hands, and thus she knelt as\none absorbed in an intensity of prayer. Even as this happened, the\npeculiar glory of the sunlight seemed to change. It shone still,\nbut without such wonderful glow, and our horses at the same time\nceased their trembling and their rigid stillness of pose. They\nshook their heads and jingled their bits, as though striving to\nthrow off some terrifying impression.",
        "“Let us withdraw from her sight,” whispered Bertrand touching my\narm, and very willingly I acceded to this suggestion, and we\nsilently pressed into the shadow of some great oaks, which stood\nhard by, the trunks of which hid us well from view. It seemed\nalmost like a species of sacrilege to stand there watching the Maid\nat her prayers, and yet I vow, that until the bell ceased we had no\nmore power to move than our horses. Why we were holden by this\nstrange spell I know not. I can only speak the truth. We saw\nnothing and we heard nothing of any miraculous kind, and yet we\nwere like men in a dream, bound hand and foot by invisible bonds, a\nwitness of something unseen to ourselves, which we saw was visible\nto another.",
        "Beneath the deep shadow of the oaks we looked back. The Maid had\nrisen to her feet by this, and was stooping to pick up her fallen\nwork. That done, she stood awhile in deep thought, her face turned\ntowards the little church, whence the bell had only just ceased to\nsound.",
        "I saw her clearly then–a maiden slim and tall, so slender that the\nrather clumsy peasant dress she wore could not give breadth or\nawkwardness to her lithe figure. The coif had slipped a little out\nof place, and some tresses of waving hair had escaped from beneath\nit, tresses that looked dark till the sun touched them, and then\nglowed like burnished gold. Her face was pale, with features in no\nway marked, but so sweet and serene was the expression of the face,\nso wonderful was the depth of the great dark eyes, that one was\nlost in admiration of her beauty, albeit unable to define wherein\nthat beauty lay.",
        "When we started forth, I had meant to try and seek speech with this\nJeanne–this Maid of Domremy–and to ask her of her mission, and\nwhether she were still believing that she would have power to carry\nit out; but this purpose now died within me.",
        "How could I dare question such a being as to her visions? Had I not\nseen how she was visited by sound or sight not sensible to those\naround her? Had I not in some sort been witness to a miracle? Was\nit for us to approach and ask of her what had been thus revealed?\nNo!–a thousand times no! If the good God had given her a message,\nshe would know when and where to deliver it. She had spoken before\nof her voices. Let them instruct her. Let not men seek to\ninterfere. And so we remained where we were, hidden in the deep\nshadows, whilst Jeanne, with bent head and lingering, graceful\nsteps, utterly unconscious of the eyes that watched her, went\nslowly out of sight along the glade leading towards the village and\nher home.",
        "Only when she had disappeared did we venture to move on in her\nwake, and so passed by the low-browed house, set in its well-tended\nlittle garden, where the d’Arc family lived. It lay close to the\nchurch, and bore a look of pleasant homelike comfort. We saw Jeanne\nbending tenderly over a chair, in which reclined the bent form of a\nlittle crippled sister. We even heard the soft, sweet voice of the\nMaid, as she answered some question asked her from within the open\ndoor. Then she lifted the bent form in her arms, and I did note how\nstrong that slim frame must be, for the burden seemed as nothing to\nher as she bore it within the house; and then she disappeared from\nview, and we rode onwards together.",
        "“There, my friend,” spoke Bertrand at last, “I have kept my\npromise, you have seen the Maid.”",
        "“Yes,” I answered gravely, “I have seen the Maid,” and after that\nwe spoke no word for many a mile.",
