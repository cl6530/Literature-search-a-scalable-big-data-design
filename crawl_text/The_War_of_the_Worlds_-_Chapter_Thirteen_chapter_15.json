        "After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terres-\ntrial weapons, the Martians retreated to their original position\nupon Horsell Common; and in their haste, and encumbered\nwith the de’bris of their smashed companion, they no doubt\noverlooked many such a stray and negligible victim as myself.\nHad they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith, there\nwas nothing at that time between them and London but\nbatteries of twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly\nhave reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their\napproach; as sudden, dreadful, and destructive their advent\nwould have been as the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon a\ncentury ago.",
        "But they were in no hurry.  Cylinder followed cylinder on\nits interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought\nthem reinforcement.  And meanwhile the military and naval\nauthorities, now fully alive to the tremendous power of their\nantagonists, worked with furious energy.  Every minute a\nfresh gun came into position until, before twilight, every\ncopse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly slopes about\nKingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle.\nAnd through the charred and desolated area--perhaps twenty\nsquare miles altogether--that encircled the Martian encamp-\nment on Horsell Common, through charred and ruined villages\namong the green trees, through the blackened and smoking\narcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys, crawled\nthe devoted scouts with the heliographs that were presently\nto warn the gunners of the Martian approach.  But the Mar-\ntians now understood our command of artillery and the\ndanger of human proximity, and not a man ventured within\na mile of either cylinder, save at the price of his life.",
        "It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of\nthe afternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything\nfrom the second and third cylinders--the second in Addle-\nstone Golf Links and the third at Pyrford--to their original\npit on Horsell Common.  Over that, above the blackened\nheather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide,\nstood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast\nfighting-machines and descended into the pit.  They were\nhard at work there far into the night, and the towering pillar\nof dense green smoke that rose therefrom could be seen from\nthe hills about Merrow, and even, it is said, from Banstead\nand Epsom Downs.",
        "And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing\nfor their next sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered\nfor the battle, I made my way with infinite pains and labour\nfrom the fire and smoke of burning Weybridge towards\nLondon.",
        "I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting\ndown-stream; and throwing off the most of my sodden\nclothes, I went after it, gained it, and so escaped out of that\ndestruction.  There were no oars in the boat, but I contrived\nto paddle, as well as my parboiled hands would allow, down\nthe river towards Halliford and Walton, going very tediously\nand continually looking behind me, as you may well under-\nstand.  I followed the river, because I considered that the\nwater gave me my best chance of escape should these giants\nreturn.",
        "The hot water from the Martian’s overthrow drifted down-\nstream with me, so that for the best part of a mile I could see\nlittle of either bank.  Once, however, I made out a string of\nblack figures hurrying across the meadows from the direction\nof Weybridge.  Halliford, it seemed, was deserted, and sev-\neral of the houses facing the river were on fire.  It was strange\nto see the place quite tranquil, quite desolate under the hot\nblue sky, with the smoke and little threads of flame going\nstraight up into the heat of the afternoon.  Never before had\nI seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an\nobstructive crowd.  A little farther on the dry reeds up the\nbank were smoking and glowing, and a line of fire inland was\nmarching steadily across a late field of hay.",
        "For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after\nthe violence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon\nthe water.  Then my fears got the better of me again, and I\nresumed my paddling.  The sun scorched my bare back.  At\nlast, as the bridge at Walton was coming into sight round the\nbend, my fever and faintness overcame my fears, and I landed\non the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick, amid the\nlong grass.  I suppose the time was then about four or five\no’clock.  I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile with-\nout meeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of\na hedge.  I seem to remember talking, wanderingly, to myself\nduring that last spurt.  I was also very thirsty, and bitterly\nregretful I had drunk no more water.  It is a curious thing\nthat I felt angry with my wife; I cannot account for it,\nbut my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me\nexcessively.",
        "I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that\nprobably I dozed.  I became aware of him as a seated figure\nin soot-smudged shirt sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-\nshaven face staring at a faint flickering that danced over the\nsky.  The sky was what is called a mackerel sky--rows and\nrows of faint down-plumes of cloud, just tinted with the\nmidsummer sunset.",
        "I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me\nquickly.",
        "“Have you any water?” I asked abruptly.",
        "He shook his head.",
        "“You have been asking for water for the last hour,” he said.",
        "For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other.  I\ndare say he found me a strange enough figure, naked, save\nfor my water-soaked trousers and socks, scalded, and my face\nand shoulders blackened by the smoke.  His face was a fair\nweakness, his chin retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost\nflaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were rather large,\npale blue, and blankly staring.  He spoke abruptly, looking\nvacantly away from me.",
        "“What does it mean?” he said.  “What do these things\nmean?”",
        "I stared at him and made no answer.",
        "He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a\ncomplaining tone.",
        "“Why are these things permitted?  What sins have we\ndone?  The morning service was over, I was walking through\nthe roads to clear my brain for the afternoon, and then--fire,\nearthquake, death!  As if it were Sodom and Gomorrah!  All\nour work undone, all the work---- What are these Mar-\ntians?”",
        "“What are we?” I answered, clearing my throat.",
        "He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again.  For\nhalf a minute, perhaps, he stared silently.",
        "“I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,” he\nsaid.  “And suddenly--fire, earthquake, death!”",
        "He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost\nto his knees.",
        "Presently he began waving his hand.",
        "“All the work--all the Sunday schools---- What have we\ndone--what has Weybridge done?  Everything gone--every-\nthing destroyed.  The church!  We rebuilt it only three years\nago.  Gone!  Swept out of existence!  Why?”",
        "Another pause, and he broke out again like one de-\nmented.",
        "“The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!\"\nhe shouted.",
        "His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direc-\ntion of Weybridge.",
        "By this time I was beginning to take his measure.  The\ntremendous tragedy in which he had been involved--it was\nevident he was a fugitive from Weybridge--had driven him\nto the very verge of his reason.",
        "“Are we far from Sunbury?” I said, in a matter-of-fact tone.",
        "“What are we to do?” he asked.  “Are these creatures every-\nwhere?  Has the earth been given over to them?”",
        "“Are we far from Sunbury?”",
        "“Only this morning I officiated at early celebration----”",
        "“Things have changed,” I said, quietly.  “You must keep\nyour head.  There is still hope.”",
        "“Hope!”",
        "“Yes.  Plentiful hope--for all this destruction!”",
        "I began to explain my view of our position.  He listened at\nfirst, but as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave\nplace to their former stare, and his regard wandered from\nme.",
        "“This must be the beginning of the end,” he said, inter-\nrupting me.  “The end!  The great and terrible day of the\nLord!  When men shall call upon the mountains and the rocks\nto fall upon them and hide them--hide them from the face\nof Him that sitteth upon the throne!”",
        "I began to understand the position.  I ceased my laboured\nreasoning, struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid\nmy hand on his shoulder.",
        "“Be a man!” said I.  “You are scared out of your wits!  What\ngood is religion if it collapses under calamity?  Think of what\nearthquakes and floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before\nto men!  Did you think God had exempted Weybridge?  He is\nnot an insurance agent.”",
        "For a time he sat in blank silence.",
        "“But how can we escape?” he asked, suddenly.  “They are\ninvulnerable, they are pitiless.”",
        "“Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,” I answered.\n“And the mightier they are the more sane and wary should\nwe be.  One of them was killed yonder not three hours ago.”",
        "“Killed!” he said, staring about him.  “How can God’s min-\nisters be killed?”",
        "“I saw it happen.” I proceeded to tell him.  “We have\nchanced to come in for the thick of it,” said I, “and that is\nall.”",
        "“What is that flicker in the sky?” he asked abruptly.",
        "I told him it was the heliograph signalling--that it was the\nsign of human help and effort in the sky.",
        "“We are in the midst of it,” I said, “quiet as it is.  That\nflicker in the sky tells of the gathering storm.  Yonder, I take\nit are the Martians, and Londonward, where those hills rise\nabout Richmond and Kingston and the trees give cover, earth-\nworks are being thrown up and guns are being placed.  Pres-\nently the Martians will be coming this way again.”",
        "And even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me\nby a gesture.",
        "“Listen!” he said.",
        "From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull\nresonance of distant guns and a remote weird crying.  Then\neverything was still.  A cockchafer came droning over the\nhedge and past us.  High in the west the crescent moon hung\nfaint and pale above the smoke of Weybridge and Shepper-\nton and the hot, still splendour of the sunset.",
        "“We had better follow this path,” I said, “northward.”",
