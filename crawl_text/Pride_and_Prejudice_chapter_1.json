        "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in\npossession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.",
        "However little known the feelings or views of such a man may\nbe on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well\nfixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered\nthe rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.",
        "“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you\nheard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”",
        "Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.",
        "“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and\nshe told me all about it.”",
        "Mr. Bennet made no answer.",
        "“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife\nimpatiently.",
        "“_You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”",
        "This was invitation enough.",
        "“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield\nis taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of\nEngland; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to\nsee the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed\nwith Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession\nbefore Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the\nhouse by the end of next week.”",
        "“What is his name?”",
        "“Bingley.”",
        "“Is he married or single?”",
        "“Oh!  Single, my dear, to be sure!  A single man of large\nfortune; four or five thousand a year.  What a fine thing for our\ngirls!”",
        "“How so?  How can it affect them?”",
        "“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so\ntiresome!  You must know that I am thinking of his marrying\none of them.”",
        "“Is that his design in settling here?”",
        "“Design!  Nonsense, how can you talk so!  But it is very likely\nthat he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\nmust visit him as soon as he comes.”",
        "“I see no occasion for that.  You and the girls may go, or you\nmay send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still\nbetter, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley\nmay like you the best of the party.”",
        "“My dear, you flatter me.  I certainly have had my share of\nbeauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\nWhen a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give\nover thinking of her own beauty.”",
        "“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”",
        "“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when\nhe comes into the neighbourhood.”",
        "“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”",
        "“But consider your daughters.  Only think what an establishment\nit would be for one of them.  Sir William and Lady Lucas are\ndetermined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you\nknow, they visit no newcomers.  Indeed you must go, for it will\nbe impossible for us to visit him if you do not.”",
        "“You are over-scrupulous, surely.  I dare say Mr. Bingley will\nbe very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\nassure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\nchooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for\nmy little Lizzy.”",
        "“I desire you will do no such thing.  Lizzy is not a bit better\nthan the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\nJane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia.  But you are always\ngiving her the preference.”",
        "“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;\n“they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy\nhas something more of quickness than her sisters.”",
        "“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a\nway?  You take delight in vexing me.  You have no compassion\nfor my poor nerves.”",
        "“You mistake me, my dear.  I have a high respect for your\nnerves.  They are my old friends.  I have heard you mention\nthem with consideration these last twenty years at least.”",
        "Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty\nyears had been insufficient to make his wife understand his\ncharacter.  Her mind was less difficult to develop.  She was a\nwoman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\ntemper.  When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\nThe business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\nsolace was visiting and news.",
