        "The chalk ridge in the north of Berkshire is rich in memories of Alfred.\nFirst in importance is Wantage, a peaceful town at the foot of the\nhills, and famous as the birthplace of the great king. There is a statue\nby Count Gleichen in the wide market-place representing Alfred with a\nbattle-axe and a charter in his hands. The church is a fine example of\nEarly English architecture, and interesting besides as the burying-place\nof many famous Fitz-warens, among them Ivo, whose daughter married\nRichard Whittington, Lord Mayor of London. Dr. Butler of The Analogywas born in the town, and the house is still to be seen.",
        "Leaving Wantage, one may go along the breezy downs to Uffington Castle,\na large fort, presumably of British origin. It was one of many similar\nforts along the Roman way called Ichenilde Street, that stretches\nstraight as an arrow along the whole ridge. Near the fort is the famous\nWhite Horse cut in the chalk, which, since its recent cleansing, gleams\nbrilliantly from the hillside. It was cut out to commemorate the\nmagnificent victory of Ethelred the Unready and Alfred over the Danes at\nAshdown in 871. Readers of Tom Brown’s School Days will recall the\nstory of the Berkshire revels in 1857, when the scouring of the Horse\ntook place. Judge Hughes was born here, under the shadow of the downs,\nand near by is the round hill where tradition says St. George slew the\ndragon.",
        "In Kenilworth Sir Walter Scott has immortalised Wayland Smith’s Cave,\na neolithic burial-place of some ancient chieftain which lies to the\nwest of Uffington Castle. It is a circle of stone slabs with flat stones\non the top. Wayland was the “Vulcan” of the men of the north, and\nAlfred, in one of his translations, altered the “Fabricius” of the Roman\naccount into the northern “Wayland,” the fairy smith who replaced lost\nshoes on horses. It was in this cave that Scott made Flibbertigibbet\nplay tricks on Tressilian.",
