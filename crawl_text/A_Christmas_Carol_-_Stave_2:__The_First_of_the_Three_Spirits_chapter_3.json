        "When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed,\nhe could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from\nthe opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to\npierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a\nneighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened\nfor the hour.",
        "To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from\nsix to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to\ntwelve; then stopped. Twelve. It was past two when he\nwent to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have\ngot into the works. Twelve.",
        "He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most\npreposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve:\nand stopped.",
        "`Why, it isn’t possible,’ said Scrooge, `that I can have\nslept through a whole day and far into another night. It\nisn’t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and\nthis is twelve at noon.’",
        "The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,\nand groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub\nthe frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he\ncould see anything; and could see very little then. All he\ncould make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely\ncold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,\nand making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been\nif night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the\nworld.  This was a great relief, because “Three days after sight\nof this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge on his\norder,” and so forth, would have become a mere United States\nsecurity if there were no days to count by.",
        "Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought\nit over and over, and could make nothing of it.  The more he\nthought, the more perplexed he was; and, the more he endeavoured\nnot to think, the more he thought.",
        "Marley’s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved\nwithin himself, after mature inquiry that it was all a dream, his\nmind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first\nposition, andpresented the same problem to be worked all through,\n“Was it a dream or not?”",
        "Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three-quarters\nmore, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost hadwarned\nhim of a visitation when the bell tolled one.  He resolved to lie\nawake until the hour\nwas passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep\nthan go to heaven, this was, perhaps, the wisest resolution in\nhis power.",
        "The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he\nmust have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. \nAt length it broke upon his listening ear.",
        "“Ding, dong!”",
        "“A quarter past,” said Scrooge, counting.",
        "“Ding, dong!”",
        "“Half past,” said Scrooge.",
        "“Ding, dong!”",
        "“A quarter to it,” said Scrooge.\n“Ding, dong!”",
        "“The hour itself,” said Scrooge triumphantly, “and nothing else!”",
        "He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a\ndeep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE.  Light flashed up in the room\nupon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.",
        "The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a\nhand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his\nback, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains\nof his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a\nhalf-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the\nunearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now \nto you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.",
        "It was a strange figure -- like a child: yet not so like a\nchild as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural\nmedium, which gave him the appearance of having receded\nfrom the view, and being diminished to a child’s proportions.\nIts hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was\nwhite as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\nit, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were\nvery long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold\nwere of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately\nformed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic\nof the purest white, and round its waist was bound\na lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held\na branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular\ncontradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed\nwith summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,\nthat from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear\njet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was\ndoubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a\ngreat extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.",
        "Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing\nsteadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt\nsparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,\nand what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so\nthe figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a\nthing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,\nnow a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a\nbody: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible\nin the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the\nvery wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and\nclear as ever.",
        "`Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to\nme.’ asked Scrooge.",
        "`I am.’",
        "The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if\ninstead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.",
        "`Who, and what are you.’ Scrooge demanded.",
        "`I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.’",
        "`Long Past.’ inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish\nstature.",
        "`No. Your past.’",
        "Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if\nanybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire\nto see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.",
        "`What.’ exclaimed the Ghost, `would you so soon put out,\nwith worldly hands, the light I give. Is it not enough\nthat you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and\nforce me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon\nmy brow.’ ",
        "Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend \nor any knowledge of having wilfully bonneted the Spirit at \nany period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what\nbusiness brought him there.",
        "`Your welfare.’ said the Ghost.",
        "Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not\nhelp thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been\nmore conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard\nhim thinking, for it said immediately:",
        "`Your reclamation, then. Take heed.’",
        "It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him\ngently by the arm.",
        "`Rise. and walk with me.’",
        "It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the\nweather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes;\nthat bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below\nfreezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers,\ndressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at\nthat time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman’s hand, \nwas not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit\nmade towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.",
        "`I am mortal,’ Scrooge remonstrated, `and liable to fall.’",
        "`Bear but a touch of my hand there,’ said the Spirit,\nlaying it upon his heart,’ and you shall be upheld in more\nthan this.’",
        "As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall,\nand stood upon an open country road, with fields on either\nhand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it\nwas to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished\nwith it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon\nthe ground.",
        "`Good Heaven!’ said Scrooge, clasping his hands together,\nas he looked about him. `I was bred in this place. I was\na boy here.’ ",
        "The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch,\nthough it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still\npresent to the old man’s sense of feeling. He was conscious\nof a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected\nwith a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares\nlong, long, forgotten.",
        "`Your lip is trembling,’ said the Ghost. `And what is\nthat upon your cheek.’ ",
        "Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice,\nthat it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him\nwhere he would.",
        "`You recollect the way.’ inquired the Spirit.",
        "`Remember it.’ cried Scrooge with fervour; `I could\nwalk it blindfold.’ ",
        "`Strange to have forgotten it for so many years.’ observed\nthe Ghost. `Let us go on.’ ",
        "They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every\ngate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared\nin the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.\nSome shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them\nwith boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in\ncountry gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys\nwere in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the\nbroad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air\nlaughed to hear it.",
        "`These are but shadows of the things that have been,’ said\nthe Ghost. `They have no consciousness of us.’ ",
        "The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge\nknew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond\nall bounds to see them. Why did his cold eye glisten, and\nhis heart leap up as they went past. Why was he filled\nwith gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\nChristmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for\ntheir several homes. What was merry Christmas to Scrooge.\nOut upon merry Christmas. What good had it ever done\nto him.",
        "`The school is not quite deserted,’ said the Ghost. `A\nsolitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.’ ",
        "Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.",
        "They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and\nsoon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little\nweathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell\nhanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken\nfortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\nwere damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their\ngates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;\nand the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.\nNor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for\nentering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open\ndoors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,\ncold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a\nchilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow\nwith too much getting up by candle-light, and not too\nmuch to eat. ",
        "They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a\ndoor at the back of the house. It opened before them, and\ndisclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by\nlines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely\nboy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down\nupon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he\nused to be.",
        "Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle\nfrom the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the\nhalf-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among\nthe leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle\nswinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in\nthe fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening\ninfluence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.",
        "The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his\nyounger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in\nforeign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at:\nstood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and\nleading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.",
        "`Why, it’s Ali Baba.’ Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. `It’s\ndear old honest Ali Baba. Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas\ntime, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone,\nhe did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy. And\nValentine,’ said Scrooge,’ and his wild brother, Orson; there\nthey go. And what’s his name, who was put down in his\ndrawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don’t you see him.\nAnd the Sultan’s Groom turned upside down by the Genii;\nthere he is upon his head. Serve him right. I’m glad of it.\nWhat business had he to be married to the Princess.’ ",
        "To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature\non such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between\nlaughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited\nface; would have been a surprise to his business friends in\nthe city, indeed.",
        "`There’s the Parrot.’ cried Scrooge. `Green body and\nyellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the\ntop of his head; there he is. Poor Robin Crusoe, he called\nhim, when he came home again after sailing round the\nisland. `Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\nCrusoe.’  The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn’t.\nIt was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running\nfor his life to the little creek. Halloa. Hoop. Hallo.’ ",
        "Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his\nusual character, he said, in pity for his former self, `Poor\nboy.’ and cried again.",
        "`I wish,’ Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his\npocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his\ncuff: `but it’s too late now.’ ",
        "`What is the matter.’ asked the Spirit.",
        "`Nothing,’ said Scrooge. `Nothing. There was a boy\nsinging a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should\nlike to have given him something: that’s all.’ ",
        "The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand:\nsaying as it did so, `Let us see another Christmas.’ ",
        "Scrooge’s former self grew larger at the words, and the \nroom became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk,\nthe windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the\nceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how\nall this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you\ndo. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything\nhad happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all\nthe other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.",
        "He was not reading now, but walking up and down\ndespairingly.",
        "Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful \nshaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.",
        "It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy,\ncame darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and\noften kissing him, addressed him as her `Dear, dear\nbrother.’",
        "`I have come to bring you home, dear brother.’ said the\nchild, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.\n`To bring you home, home, home.’ ",
        "`Home, little Fan.’ returned the boy.",
        "`Yes.’ said the child, brimful of glee. `Home, for good\nand all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder\nthan he used to be, that home’s like Heaven. He spoke so\ngently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that\nI was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come\nhome; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach\nto bring you. And you’re to be a man.’ said the child,\nopening her eyes,’ and are never to come back here; but\nfirst, we’re to be together all the Christmas long, and have\nthe merriest time in all the world.’ ",
        "`You are quite a woman, little Fan.’ exclaimed the boy.",
        "She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his\nhead; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on\ntiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her\nchildish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to\ngo, accompanied her.",
        "A terrible voice in the hall cried. `Bring down Master\nScrooge’s box, there.’ and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster\nhimself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious\ncondescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind\nby shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his\nsister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that\never was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial\nand terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.\nHere he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a\nblock of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments\nof those dainties to the young people: at the same time,\nsending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of something\nto the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\nbut if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had\nrather not. Master Scrooge’s trunk being by this time tied\non to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster\ngood-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove\ngaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the\nhoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens\nlike spray.",
        "`Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have\nwithered,’ said the Ghost. `But she had a large heart.’ ",
        "`So she had,’ cried Scrooge. `You’re right. I will not\ngainsay it, Spirit. God forbid.’ ",
        "`She died a woman,’ said the Ghost, `and had, as I think,\nchildren.’ ",
        "`One child,’ Scrooge returned.",
        "`True,’ said the Ghost. `Your nephew.’ ",
        "Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly,\n`Yes.’ ",
        "Although they had but that moment left the school behind\nthem, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city,\nwhere shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy\ncarts and coaches battle for the way, and all the strife and\ntumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by\nthe dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas\ntime again; but it was evening, and the streets were\nlighted up.",
        "The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked\nScrooge if he knew it.",
        "`Know it.’ said Scrooge. `I was apprenticed here.’ ",
        "They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh \nwig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two\ninches taller he must have knocked his head against the\nceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:",
        "`Why, it’s old Fezziwig. Bless his heart; it’s Fezziwig\nalive again.’ ",
        "Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the\nclock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his\nhands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over\nhimself, from his shows to his organ of benevolence; and\ncalled out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:",
        "`Yo ho, there. Ebenezer. Dick.’ ",
        "Scrooge’s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly\nin, accompanied by his fellow-prentice.",
        "`Dick Wilkins, to be sure.’ said Scrooge to the Ghost.\n`Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached\nto me, was Dick. Poor Dick. Dear, dear.’ ",
        "`Yo ho, my boys.’ said Fezziwig. `No more work to-night.\nChristmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer. Let’s\nhave the shutters up,’ cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap\nof his hands,’ before a man can say Jack Robinson.’ ",
        "You wouldn’t believe how those two fellows went at it.\nThey charged into the street with the shutters -- one, two,\nthree -- had them up in their places -- four, five, six -- barred\nthem and pinned then -- seven, eight, nine -- and came back\nbefore you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.",
        "`Hilli-ho!’ cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the\nhigh desk, with wonderful agility. `Clear away, my lads,\nand let’s have lots of room here. Hilli-ho, Dick. Chirrup,\nEbenezer.’ ",
        "Clear away. There was nothing they wouldn’t have cleared\naway, or couldn’t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking\non. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if\nit were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was\nswept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon\nthe fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and\nbright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter’s\nnight.",
        "In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the\nlofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty\nstomach-aches. In came Mrs Fezziwig, one vast substantial\nsmile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and\nlovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they\nbroke. In came all the young men and women employed in\nthe business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the\nbaker. In came the cook, with her brother’s particular friend,\nthe milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was\nsuspected of not having board enough from his master; trying\nto hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who\nwas proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.\nIn they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly,\nsome gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling;\nin they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went,\ntwenty couples at once; hands half round and back again\nthe other way; down the middle and up again; round\nand round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old\ntop couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top\ncouple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top\ncouples at last, and not a bottom one to help them. When\nthis result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his\nhands to stop the dance, cried out,’ Well done.’ and the\nfiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially\nprovided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his\nreappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no\ndancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, \nexhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man\nresolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.",
        "There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more\ndances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there\nwas a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece\nof Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.\nBut the great effect of the evening came after the Roast\nand Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind. The sort\nof man who knew his business better than you or I could\nhave told it him.) struck up Sir Roger de Coverley.’  Then\nold Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs Fezziwig. Top\ncouple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them;\nthree or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were\nnot to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no\nnotion of walking.",
        "But if they had been twice as many -- ah, four times --\nold Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would\nMrs Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner\nin every sense of the term. If that’s not high praise, tell me\nhigher, and I’ll use it. A positive light appeared to issue\nfrom Fezziwig’s calves. They shone in every part of the\ndance like moons. You couldn’t have predicted, at any given\ntime, what would have become of them next. And when old\nFezziwig and Mrs Fezziwig had gone all through the dance;\nadvance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and\ncurtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to\nyour place; Fezziwig cut -- cut so deftly, that he appeared\nto wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without\na stagger.",
        "When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.\nMr and Mrs Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side\nof the door, and shaking hands with every person individually\nas he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.\nWhen everybody had retired but the two prentices, they did\nthe same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away,\nand the lads were left to their beds; which were under a\ncounter in the back-shop.",
        "During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a\nman out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene,\nand with his former self. He corroborated everything,\nremembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent\nthe strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the\nbright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from\nthem, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious\nthat it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its\nhead burnt very clear.",
        "`A small matter,’ said the Ghost, `to make these silly\nfolks so full of gratitude.’",
        "`Small.’ echoed Scrooge.",
        "The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices,\nwho were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig:\nand when he had done so, said,",
        "`Why. Is it not. He has spent but a few pounds of\nyour mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so\nmuch that he deserves this praise.’ ",
        "`It isn’t that,’ said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and\nspeaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.\n`It isn’t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy\nor unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a\npleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and\nlooks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is\nimpossible\nto add and count them up: what then. The happiness\nhe gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.’ ",
        "He felt the Spirit’s glance, and stopped.",
        "`What is the matter.’ asked the Ghost.",
        "`Nothing in particular,’ said Scrooge. ",
        "`Something, I think.’ the Ghost insisted.",
        "`No,’ said Scrooge,’ No. I should like to be able to say\na word or two to my clerk just now. That’s all.’ ",
        "His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance\nto the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by\nside in the open air.",
        "`My time grows short,’ observed the Spirit. `Quick.’ ",
        "This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he\ncould see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again\nScrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime\nof life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later\nyears; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.\nThere was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which\nshowed the passion that had taken root, and where the\nshadow of the growing tree would fall.",
        "He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young\ngirl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears,\nwhich sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of\nChristmas Past.",
        "`It matters little,’ she said, softly. `To you, very little.\nAnother idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort\nyou in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have\nno just cause to grieve.’ ",
        "`What Idol has displaced you.’ he rejoined.",
        "`A golden one.’ ",
        "`This is the even-handed dealing of the world.’ he said.\n`There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and\nthere is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity\nas the pursuit of wealth.’ ",
        "`You fear the world too much,’ she answered, gently.\n`All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being\nbeyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your\nnobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion,\nGain, engrosses you. Have I not.’ ",
        "`What then.’ he retorted. `Even if I have grown so\nmuch wiser, what then. I am not changed towards you.’ ",
        "She shook her head.",
        "`Am I.’ ",
        "`Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were\nboth poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could\nimprove our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You\nare changed. When it was made, you were another man.’ ",
        "`I was a boy,’ he said impatiently.",
        "`Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you\nare,’ she returned. `I am. That which promised happiness\nwhen we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that\nwe are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of\nthis, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it,\nand can release you.’ ",
        "`Have I ever sought release.’ ",
        "`In words. No. Never.’ ",
        "`In what, then.’ ",
        "`In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another\natmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In\neverything that made my love of any worth or value in your\nsight. If this had never been between us,’ said the girl,\nlooking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him;’ tell me,\nwould you seek me out and try to win me now. Ah, no.’ ",
        "He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in\nspite of himself. But he said with a struggle,’ You think\nnot.’ ",
        "`I would gladly think otherwise if I could,’ she answered,\n`Heaven knows. When I have learned a Truth like this,\nI know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you\nwere free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe\nthat you would choose a dowerless girl -- you who, in your\nvery confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or,\nchoosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your\none guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your\nrepentance and regret would surely follow. I do; and I\nrelease you. With a full heart, for the love of him you\nonce were.’ ",
        "He was about to speak; but with her head turned from\nhim, she resumed.",
        "`You may -- the memory of what is past half makes me\nhope you will -- have pain in this. A very, very brief time,\nand you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an\nunprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you\nawoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen.’ ",
        "She left him, and they parted.",
        "`Spirit.’ said Scrooge,’ show me no more. Conduct\nme home. Why do you delight to torture me.’ ",
        "`One shadow more.’ exclaimed the Ghost.",
        "`No more.’ cried Scrooge. `No more, I don’t wish to\nsee it. Show me no more.’ ",
        "But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms,\nand forced him to observe what happened next.",
        "They were in another scene and place; a room, not very\nlarge or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter\nfire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge\nbelieved it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely\nmatron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this\nroom was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children\nthere, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\nand, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not\nforty children conducting themselves like one, but every\nchild was conducting itself like forty. The consequences\nwere uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;\non the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,\nand enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands\nmost ruthlessly. What would I not have given to one of\nthem. Though I never could have been so rude, no, no. I\nwouldn’t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that\nbraided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little\nshoe, I wouldn’t have plucked it off, God bless my soul. to\nsave my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they\ndid, bold young brood, I couldn’t have done it; I should\nhave expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment,\nand never come straight again. And yet I should\nhave dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have\nquestioned her, that she might have opened them; to have\nlooked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never\nraised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of\nwhich would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should\nhave liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence\nof a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its\nvalue.",
        "But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a\nrush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and\nplundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed\nand boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who\ncame home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys\nand presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and\nthe onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter.\nThe scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his\npockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight\nby his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back,\nand kick his legs in irrepressible affection. The shouts of\nwonder and delight with which the development of every\npackage was received. The terrible announcement that the\nbaby had been taken in the act of putting a doll’s frying-pan\ninto his mouth, and was more than suspected of having\nswallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter.\nThe immense relief of finding this a false alarm. The joy, \nand gratitude, and ecstasy. They are all indescribable alike.\nIt is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions\ngot out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the\ntop of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.",
        "And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever,\nwhen the master of the house, having his daughter leaning\nfondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his\nown fireside; and when he thought that such another\ncreature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might\nhave called him father, and been a spring-time in the\nhaggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.",
        "`Belle,’ said the husband, turning to his wife with a\nsmile,’ I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.’ ",
        "`Who was it.’ ",
        "`Guess.’ ",
        "`How can I. Tut, don’t I know.’ she added in the\nsame breath, laughing as he laughed. `Mr Scrooge.’ ",
        "`Mr Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as\nit was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could\nscarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point\nof death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in\nthe world, I do believe.’ ",
        "`Spirit.’ said Scrooge in a broken voice,’ remove me\nfrom this place.’ ",
        "`I told you these were shadows of the things that have\nbeen,’ said the Ghost. `That they are what they are, do\nnot blame me.’ ",
        "`Remove me.’ Scrooge exclaimed,’ I cannot bear it.’ ",
        "He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon\nhim with a face, in which in some strange way there were\nfragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.",
        "`Leave me. Take me back. Haunt me no longer.’ ",
        "In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which\nthe Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was\nundisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed\nthat its light was burning high and bright; and dimly\nconnecting that with its influence over him, he seized the\nextinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down\nupon its head.",
        "The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher\ncovered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down\nwith all his force, he could not hide the light, which streamed\nfrom under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.",
        "He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an\nirresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own\nbedroom.  He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand\nrelaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank\ninto a heavy sleep.",
