        "It would please me very much, at no distant day, to issue a small book\nfilled with choice recipes and directions for making home happy. I have\naccumulated an immense assortment of these things, all of general use and\nall excellent in their way, because they have been printed in papers all\nover the country–papers that would not be wrong. Some of these recipes I\nhave tried.",
        "I have tried the recipe for paste and directions for applying wall paper,\nas published recently in an agricultural paper to which I had become very\nmuch attached.",
        "This recipe had all the characteristics of an ingenuous and honest\ndocument. I cut it out of the paper and filed it away where I came very\nnear not finding it again. But I was unfortunate enough to find it after a\nlong search.",
        "The scheme was to prepare a flour paste that would hold forever, and at\nthe same time make the paper look smooth and neat to the casual observer.\nIt consisted of so many parts flour, so many parts hot water and so many\nparts common glue. First, the walls were to be sized, however. I took a\ncommon tape measure and sized the walls.",
        "Then I put a dishpan on the cook stove, poured in the flour, boiling water\nand glue. This rapidly produced a dark brown mess of dough, to which I was\nobliged to add more hot water. It looked extremely repulsive to me, but it\nlooked a good deal better than it smelled.",
        "I did not have much faith in it, but I thought I would try it. I put some\nof it on a long strip of wall paper and got up on a chair to apply it. In\nthe excitement of trying to stick it on the wall as nearly perpendicular\nas possible, I lost my balance while still holding the paper and fell in\nsuch a manner as to wrap four yards of bronze paper and common flour paste\naround my wife’s head, with the exception of about four feet of the paper\nwhich I applied to an oil painting of a Gordon Setter in a gilt frame.",
        "I decline to detail the dialogue which then took place between my wife and\nmyself. Whatever claim the public may have on me, it has no right to\ndemand this. It will continue to remain sacred. That is, not so very\nsacred of course, if I remember my exact language at the time, but\nsacredly secret from the prying eyes of the public.",
        "It is singular, but it is none the less the never dying truth, that the\nonly time that paste ever stuck anything at all, was when I applied it to\nmy wife and that picture. After that it did everything but adhere. It\ngourmed and it gummed everything, but that was all.",
        "The man who wrote the recipe may have been stuck on it, but nothing else\never was.",
        "Finally a friend came along who helped me pick the paper off the dog and\nsoothe my wife. He said that what this paste needed was more glue and a\nquart of molasses. I added these ingredients, and constructed a quart of\nchemical molasses which looked like crude ginger bread in a molten state.",
        "Then, with the aid of my friend, I proceeded to paper the room. The paper\nwould seem to adhere at times, and then it would refrain from adhering.\nThis was annoying, but we succeeded in applying the paper to the walls in\na way that showed we were perfectly sincere about it. We didn’t seek to\nmislead anybody or cover up anything. Any one could see where each roll of\npaper tried to be amicable with its neighbor–also where we had tried the\nlaying on of hands in applying the paper.",
        "We got all the paper on in good shape–also the bronze. But they were in\ndifferent places. The paper was on the walls, but the bronze was mostly on\nour clothes and on our hands. I was very tired when I got through, and I\nwent to bed early, hoping to get much needed rest. In the morning, when I\nfelt fresh and rested, I thought that the paper would look better to me.",
        "There is where I fooled myself. It did not look better to me. It looked\nworse.",
        "All night long I could occasionally hear something crack like a Fourth of\nJuly. I did not know at the time what it was, but in the morning I\ndiscovered.",
        "It seems that, during the night, that paper had wrinkled itself up like\nthe skin on the neck of a pioneer hen after death. It had pulled itself\ntogether with so much zeal that the room was six inches smaller each way\nand the carpet didn’t fit.",
        "There is only one way to insure success in the publication of recipes.\nThey must be tried by the editor himself before they are printed. If you\nhave a good recipe for paste, you must try it before you print it. If you\nhave a good remedy for botts, you must get a botty horse somewhere and try\nthe remedy before you submit it. If you think of publishing the antidote\nfor a certain poison, you should poison some one and try the antidote on\nhim, in order to test it, before you bamboozle the readers of your paper.",
        "This, of course, will add a good deal of extra work for the editor, but\neditors need more work. All they do now is to have fun with each other,\ndraw their princely salaries, and speak sarcastically of the young poet\nwho sings,",
        "  “You have came far o’er the sea,\n  And I’ve went away from thee.”",
