        "“Truly, I never have seen the market and street so deserted!\nHow as if it were swept looks the town, or had perished! Not fifty\nAre there, methinks, of all our inhabitants in it remaining,\nWhat will not curiosity do! here is every one running,\nHurrying to gaze on the sad procession of pitiful exiles.\nFully a league it must be to the causeway they have to pass over,\nYet all are hurrying down in the dusty heat of the noonday.\nI, in good sooth, would not stir from my place to witness the sorrows\nBorne by good, fugitive people, who now, with their rescued possessions,\nDriven, alas! from beyond the Rhine, their beautiful country,\nOver to us are coming, and through the prosperous corner\nRoam of this our luxuriant valley, and traverse its windings.\nWell hast thou done, good wife, our son in thus kindly dispatching,\nLaden with something to eat and to drink, and with store of old linen,\n’Mongst the poor folk to distribute; for giving belongs to the wealthy.\nHow the youth drives, to be sure! What control he has over the horses!\nMakes not our carriage a handsome appearance,—the new one? With comfort,\nFour could be seated within, with a place on the box for the coachman.\nThis time, he drove by himself. How lightly it rolled round the corner!\"\nThus, as he sat at his ease in the porch of his house on the market,\nUnto his wife was speaking mine host of the Golden Lion.",
        "Thereupon answered and said the prudent, intelligent housewife:\n\"Father, I am not inclined to be giving away my old linen:\nSince it serves many a purpose; and cannot be purchased for money,\nWhen we may want it. To-day, however, I gave, and with pleasure,\nMany a piece that was better, indeed, in shirts and in bed-clothes;\nFor I was told of the aged and children who had to go naked.\nBut wilt thou pardon me, father? thy wardrobe has also been plundered.\nAnd, in especial, the wrapper that has the East-Indian flowers,\nMade of the finest of chintz, and lined with delicate flannel,\nGave I away: it was thin and old, and quite out of the fashion.”",
        "Thereupon answered and said, with a smile, the excellent landlord:\n\"Faith! I am sorry to lose it, my good old calico wrapper,\nReal East-Indian stuff: I never shall get such another.\nWell, I had given up wearing it: nowadays, custom compels us\nAlways to go in surtout, and never appear but in jacket;\nAlways to have on our boots; forbidden are night-cap and slippers.”",
        "“See!” interrupted the wife; “even now some are yonder returning,\nWho have beheld the procession: it must, then, already be over.\nLook at the dust on their shoes! and see how their faces are glowing!\nEvery one carries his kerchief, and with it is wiping the sweat off.\nNot for a sight like that would I run so far and so suffer,\nThrough such a heat; in sooth, enough shall I have in the telling.”",
        "Thereupon answered and said, with emphasis, thus, the good father:\n\"Rarely does weather like this attend such a harvest as this is.\nWe shall be bringing our grain in dry, as the hay was before it.\nNot the least cloud to be seen, so perfectly clear is the heaven;\nAnd, with delicious coolness, the wind blows in from the eastward.\nThat is the weather to last! over-ripe are the cornfields already;\nWe shall begin on the morrow to gather our copious harvest.”",
        "Constantly, while he thus spoke, the crowds of men and of women\nGrew, who their homeward way were over the market-place wending;\nAnd, with the rest, there also returned, his daughters beside him,\nBack to his modernized house on the opposite side of the market,\nForemost merchant of all the town, their opulent neighbor,\nRapidly driving his open barouche,—it was builded in Landau.\nLively now grew the streets, for the city was handsomely peopled.\nMany a trade was therein carried on, and large manufactures.",
        "Under their doorway thus the affectionate couple were sitting,\nPleasing themselves with many remarks on the wandering people.\nFinally broke in, however, the worthy housewife, exclaiming:\n\"Yonder our pastor, see! is hitherward coming, and with him\nComes our neighbor the doctor, so they shall every thing tell us;\nAll they have witnessed abroad, and which ’tis a sorrow to look on.”",
        "Cordially then the two men drew nigh, and saluted the couple;\nSat themselves down on the benches of wood that were placed in the doorway,\nShaking the dust from their feet, and fanning themselves with their kerchiefs.\nThen was the doctor, as soon as exchanged were the mutual greetings,\nFirst to begin, and said, almost in a tone of vexation:\n\"Such is mankind, forsooth! and one man is just like another,\nLiking to gape and to stare when ill-luck has befallen his neighbor.\nEvery one hurries to look at the flames, as they soar in destruction;\nRuns to behold the poor culprit, to execution conducted:\nNow all are sallying forth to gaze on the need of these exiles,\nNor is there one who considers that he, by a similar fortune,\nMay, in the future, if not indeed next, be likewise o’ertaken.\nLevity not to be pardoned, I deem; yet it lies in man’s nature.”",
        "Thereupon answered and said the noble, intelligent pastor;\nOrnament he of the town, still young, in the prime of his manhood.\nHe was acquainted with life,—with the needs of his hearers acquainted;\nDeeply imbued he was with the Holy Scriptures’ importance,\nAs they reveal man’s destiny to us, and man’s disposition;\nThoroughly versed, besides, in best of secular writings.\n\"I should be loath,” he replied, “to censure an innocent instinct,\nWhich to mankind by good mother Nature has always been given.\nWhat understanding and reason may sometimes fail to accomplish,\nOft will such fortunate impulse, that bears us resistlessly with it.\nDid curiosity draw not man with its potent attraction,\nSay, would he ever have learned how harmoniously fitted together\nWorldly experiences are? For first what is novel he covets;\nThen with unwearying industry follows he after the useful;\nFinally longs for the good by which he is raised and ennobled.\nWhile he is young, such lightness of mind is a joyous companion,\nTraces of pain-giving evil effacing as soon as ’tis over.\nHe is indeed to be praised, who, out of this gladness of temper,\nHas in his ripening years a sound understanding developed;\nWho, in good fortune or ill, with zeal and activity labors:\nSuch an one bringeth to pass what is good, and repaireth the evil.”",
        "Then broke familiarly in the housewife impatient, exclaiming:\n\"Tell us of what ye have seen; for that I am longing to hear of!”",
        "“Hardly,” with emphasis then the village doctor made answer,\n\"Can I find spirits so soon after all the scenes I have witnessed.\nOh, the manifold miseries! who shall be able to tell them?\nE’en before crossing the meadows, and while we were yet at a distance,\nSaw we the dust; but still from hill to hill the procession\nPassed away out of our sight, and we could distinguish but little,\nBut when at last we were come to the street that crosses the valley,\nGreat was the crowd and confusion of persons on foot and of wagons.\nThere, alas! saw we enough of these poor unfortunates passing,\nAnd could from some of them learn how bitter the sorrowful flight was,\nYet how joyful the feeling of life thus hastily rescued.\nMournful it was to behold the most miscellaneous chattels,—\nAll those things which are housed in every well- furnished dwelling,\nAll by the house-keeper’s care set up in their suitable places,\nAlways ready for use; for useful is each and important.-\nNow these things to behold, piled up on all manner of wagons,\nOne on the top of another, as hurriedly they had been rescued.\nOver the chest of drawers were the sieve and wool coverlet lying;\nThrown in the kneading-trough lay the bed, and the sheets on the mirror.\nDanger, alas! as we learned ourselves in our great conflagration\nTwenty years since, will take from a man all power of reflection,\nSo that he grasps things worthless and leaves what is precious behind him.\nHere, too, with unconsidering care they were carrying with them\nPitiful trash, that only encumbered the horses and oxen;\nSuch as old barrels and boards, the pen for the goose, and the bird-cage.\nWomen and children, too, went toiling along with their bundles,",
        "Panting ’neath baskets and tubs, full of things of no manner of value:\nSo unwilling is man to relinquish his meanest possession.\nThus on the dusty road the crowded procession moved forward,\nAll confused and disordered. The one whose beasts were the weaker,\nWanted more slowly to drive, while faster would hurry another.\nPresently went up a scream from the closely squeezed women and children,\nAnd with the yelping of dogs was mingled the lowing of cattle,\nCries of distress from the aged and sick, who aloft on the wagon,\nHeavy and thus overpacked, upon beds were sitting and swaying.\nPressed at last from the rut and out to the edge of the highway,\nSlipped the creaking wheel; the cart lost its balance, and over\nFell in the ditch. In the swing the people were flung to a distance,\nFar off into the field, with horrible screams; by good fortune\nLater the boxes were thrown and fell more near to the wagon.\nVerily all who had witnessed the fall, expected to see them\nCrushed into pieces beneath the weight of trunks and of presses.\nSo lay the cart all broken to fragments, and helpless the people.\nKeeping their onward way, the others drove hastily by them,\nEach thinking only of self, and carried away by the current.\nThen we ran to the spot, and found the sick and the aged,—\nThose who at home and in bed could before their lingering ailments\nScarcely endure,—lying bruised on the ground, complaining and groaning,\nChoked by the billowing dust, and scorched by the heat of the noonday.”",
        "Thereupon answered and said the kind-hearted landlord, with feeling:\n\"Would that our Hermann might meet them and give them refreshment and clothing!\nLoath should I be to behold them: the looking on suffering pains me.\nTouched by the earliest tidings of their so cruel afflictions,\nHastily sent we a mite from out of our super-abundance,\nOnly that some might be strengthened, and we might ourselves be made easy.\nBut let us now no longer renew these sorrowful pictures\nKnowing how readily fear steals into the heart of us mortals,\nAnd anxiety, worse to me than the actual evil.\nCome with me into the room behind, our cool little parlor,\nWhere no sunbeam e’er shines, and no sultry breath ever enters\nThrough its thickness of wall. There mother will bring us a flagon\nOf our old eighty-three, with which we may banish our fancies.\nHere ’tis not cosey to drink: the flies so buzz round the glasses.\"\nThither adjourned they then, and all rejoiced in the coolness.",
        "Carefully brought forth the mother the clear and glorious vintage,\nCased in a well-polished flask, on a waiter of glittering pewter,\nSet round with large green glasses, the drinking cups meet for the Rhine Wine.\nSo sat the three together about the highly waxed table,\nGleaming and round and brown, that on mighty feet was supported,\nJoyously rang at once the glasses of landlord and pastor,\nBut his motionless held the third, and sat lost in reflection,\nUntil with words of good-humor the landlord challenged him, saying,—\n\"Come, sir neighbor, empty your glass, for God in his mercy\nThus far has kept us from evil, and so in the future will keep us.\nFor who acknowledges not, that since our dread conflagration,\nWhen he so hardly chastised us, he now is continually blessing,\nConstantly shielding, as man the apple of his eye watches over,\nHolding it precious and dear above all the rest of his members?\nShall he in time to come not defend us and furnish us succor?\nOnly when danger is nigh do we see how great is his power.\nShall he this blooming town which he once by industrious burghers\nBuilt up afresh from its ashes, and afterwards blessed with abundance,\nNow demolish again, and bring all the labor to nothing? “",
        "Cheerfully said in reply the excellent pastor, and kindly:\n\"Keep thyself firm in the faith, and firm abide in this temper;\nFor it makes steadfast and wise when fortune is fair, and when evil,\nFurnishes sweet consolation and animates hopes the sublimest.”",
        "Then made answer the landlord, with thoughts judicious and manly:\n\"Often the Rhine’s broad stream have I with astonishment greeted,\nAs I have neared it again, after travelling abroad upon business.\nAlways majestic it seemed, and my mind and spirit exalted.\nBut I could never imagine its beautiful banks would so shortly\nBe to a rampart transformed, to keep from our borders the Frenchman,\nAnd its wide-spreading bed be a moat all passage to hinder.\nSee! thus nature protects, the stout-hearted Germans protect us,\nAnd thus protects us the Lord, who then will he weakly despondent?\nWeary already the combatants, all indications are peaceful.\nWould it might be that when that festival, ardently longed for,\nShall in our church be observed, when the sacred Te Deum is rising,\nSwelled by the pealing of organ and bells, and the blaring of trumpets,—\nWould it might be that that day should behold my Hermann, sir pastor,\nStanding, his choice now made, with his bride before thee at the altar,\nMaking that festal day, that through every land shall be honored,\nMy anniversary, too, henceforth of domestic rejoicing!\nBut I observe with regret, that the youth so efficient and active\nEver in household affairs, when abroad is timid and backward.\nLittle enjoyment he finds in going about among others;\nNay, he will even avoid young ladies’ society wholly;\nShuns the enlivening dance which all young persons delight in.”",
        "Thus he spoke and listened; for now was heard in the distance\nClattering of horses’ hoofs drawing near, and the roll of the wagon,\nWhich, with furious haste, came thundering under the gateway.",
        "Ow when of comely mien the son came into the chamber,\nTurned with a searching look the eyes of the preacher upon him,\nAnd, with the gaze of the student, who easily fathoms expression,\nScrutinized well his face and form and his general bearing.\nThen with a smile he spoke, and said in words of affection:\n\"Truly a different being thou comest! I never have seen thee\nCheerful as now, nor ever beheld I thy glances so beaming.\nJoyous thou comest, and happy: ’tis plain that among the poor people\nThou hast been sharing thy gifts, and receiving their blessings upon thee.”",
        "Quietly then, and with serious words, the son made him answer:\n\"If I have acted as ye will commend, I know not; but I followed\nThat which my heart bade me do, as I shall exactly relate you.\nThou wert, mother, so long in rummaging ’mong thy old pieces,\nPicking and choosing, that not until late was thy bundle together;\nThen too the wine and the beer took care and time in the packing.\nWhen I came forth through the gateway at last, and out on the high-road,\nBackward the crowd of citizens streamed with women and children,\nComing to meet me; for far was already the band of the exiles.\nQuicker I kept on my way, and drove with speed to the village,\nWhere they were meaning to rest, as I heard, and tarry till morning.\nThitherward up the new street as I hasted, a stout-timbered wagon,\nDrawn by two oxen, I saw, of that region the largest and strongest;\nWhile, with vigorous steps, a maiden was walking beside them,\nAnd, a long staff in her hand, the two powerful creatures was guiding,\nUrging them now, now holding them back; with skill did she drive them.\nSoon as the maiden perceived me, she calmly drew near to the horses,\nAnd in these words she addressed me: ’ Not thus deplorable always\nHas our condition been, as to-day on this journey thou seest.\nI am not yet grown used to asking gifts of a stranger,\nWhich he will often unwillingly give, to be rid of the beggar.\nBut necessity drives me to speak; for here, on the straw, lies\nNewly delivered of child, a rich land-owner’s wife, whom I scarcely\nHave in her pregnancy, safe brought off with the oxen and wagon.\nNaked, now in her arms the new-born infant is lying,\nAnd but little the help our friends will be able to furnish,\nIf in the neighboring village, indeed, where to-day we would rest us,\nStill we shall find them; though much do I fear they already have passed it.\nShouldst thou have linen to spare of any description, provided\nThou of this neighborhood art, to the poor in charity give it.’",
        "“Thus she spoke, and the pale-faced mother raised herself feebly\nUp from the straw, and towards me looked. Then said I in answer:\n’Surely unto the good, a spirit from heaven oft speaketh,\nMaking them feel the distress that threatens a suffering brother.\nFor thou must know that my mother, already presaging thy sorrows,\nGave me a bundle to use it straightway for the need of the naked,’\nThen I untied the knots of the string, and the wrapper of father’s\nUnto her gave, and gave her as well the shirts and the linen.\nAnd she thanked me with joy, and cried: ’The happy believe not\nMiracles yet can be wrought: for only in need we acknowledge\nGod’s own hand and finger, that leads the good to show goodness,\nWhat unto us he has done through thee, may he do to thee also!\nAnd I beheld with what pleasure the sick woman handled the linens,\nBut with especial delight the dressing-gown’s delicate flannel.\n’Let us make haste,’ the maid to her said, ’and come to the village,\nWhere our people will halt for the night and already are resting.\nThere these clothes for the children I, one and all, straightway will portion.’\nThen she saluted again, her thanks most warmly expressing,\nStarted the oxen; the wagon went on; but there I still lingered,\nStill held the horses in check; for now my heart was divided\nWhether to drive with speed to the village, and there the provisions\nShare ’mong the rest of the people, or whether I here to the maiden\nAll should deliver at once, for her discreetly to portion.\nAnd in an instant my heart had decided, and quietly driving\nAfter the maiden, I soon overtook her, and said to her quickly:\n’Hearken, good maiden;—my mother packed up not linen-stuffs only\nInto the carriage, that I should have clothes to furnish the naked;\nWine and beer she added besides, and supply of provisions:\nPlenty of all these things I have in the box of the carriage.\nBut now I feel myself moved to deliver these offerings also\nInto thy hand; for so shall I best fulfil my commission.\nThou wilt divide them with judgment, while I must by chance be directed.’\nThereupon answered the maiden: ’I will with faithfulness portion\nThese thy gifts, that all shall bring comfort to those who are needy.’\nThus she spoke, and quickly the box of the carriage I opened,\nBrought forth thence the substantial hams, and brought out the breadstuffs,\nBottles of wine and beer, and one and all gave to the maiden.\nWillingly would I have given her more, but the carriage was empty.\nAll she packed at the sick woman’s feet, and went on her journey.\nI, with my horses and carriage, drove rapidly back to the city.”",
        "Instantly now, when Hermann had ceased, the talkative neighbor\nTook up the word, and cried: “Oh happy, in days like the present,\nDays of flight and confusion, who lives by himself in his dwelling,\nHaving no wife nor child to be clinging about him in terror!\nHappy I feel myself now, and would not for much be called father;\nWould not have wife and children to-day, for whom to be anxious.\nOft have I thought of this flight before; and have packed up together\nAll my best things already, the chains and old pieces of money\nThat were my sainted mother’s, of which not one has been sold yet.\nMuch would be left behind, it is true, not easily gotten.\nEven the roots and the herbs, that were with such industry gathered,\nI should be sorry to lose, though the worth of the goods is but trifling.\nIf my purveyor remained, I could go from my dwelling contented.\nWhen my cash I have brought away safe, and have rescued my person,\nAll is safe: none find it so easy to fly as the single.”",
        "“Neighbor,” unto his words young Hermann with emphasis answered:\n\"I can in no wise agree with thee here, and censure thy language.\nIs he indeed a man to be prized, who, in good and in evil,\nTakes no thought but for self, and gladness and sorrow with others\nKnows not how to divide, nor feels his heart so impel him?\nRather than ever to-day would I make up my mind to be married:\nMany a worthy maiden is needing a husband’s protection,\nAnd the man needs an inspiriting wife when ill is impending.’’",
        "Thereupon smiling the father replied: “Thus love I to hear thee!\nThat is a sensible word such as rarely I’ve known thee to utter.\"\nStraightway, however, the mother broke in with quickness, exclaiming:\n\"Son, to be sure, thou art right! we parents have set the example;\nSeeing that not in our season of joy did we choose one another;\nRather the saddest of hours it was that bound us together.\nMonday morning—I mind it well; for the day that preceded\nCame that terrible fire by which our city was ravaged-\nTwenty years will have gone. The day was a Sunday as this is;\nHot and dry was the season; the water was almost exhausted.\nAll the people were strolling abroad in their holiday dresses,\n’Mong the villages partly, and part in the mills and the taverns.\nAnd at the end of the city the flames began, and went coursing\nQuickly along the streets, creating a draught in their passage.\nBurned were the barns where the copious harvest already was garnered;\nBurned were the streets as far as the market; the house of my father,\nNeighbor to this, was destroyed, and this one also fell with it.\nLittle we managed to save. I sat, that sorrowful night through,\nOutside the town on the common, to guard the beds and the boxes.\nSleep overtook me at last, and when I again was awakened,\nFeeling the chill of the morning that always descends before sunrise,\nThere were the smoke and the glare, and the walls and chimneys in ruins.\nThen fell a weight on my heart; but more majestic than ever\nCame up the sun again, inspiring my bosom with courage.\nThen I rose hastily up, with a yearning the place to revisit\nWhereon our dwelling had stood, and to see if the hens had been rescued,\nWhich I especially loved, for I still was a child in my feelings.\nThus as I over the still-smoking timbers of house and of court-yard\nPicked my way, and beheld the dwelling so ruined and wasted,\nThou camest up to examine the place, from the other direction.\nUnder the ruins thy horse in his stall had been buried; the rubbish\nLay on the spot and the glimmering beams; of the horse we saw nothing.\nThoughtful and grieving we stood there thus, each facing the other,\nNow that the wall was fallen that once had divided our court-yards.\nThereupon thou by the hand didst take me, and speak to me, saying,—\n’Lisa, how earnest thou hither? Go back! thy soles must be burning;\nHot the rubbish is here: it scorches my boots, which are stronger.’\nAnd thou didst lift me up, and carry me out through thy court-yard.\nThere was the door of the house left standing yet with its archway,\nJust as ’tis standing now, the one thing only remaining.\nThen thou didst set me down and kiss me; to that I objected;\nBut thou didst answer and say with kindly significant language:\n’See! my house lies in ruins: remain here and help me rebuild it;\nSo shall my help in return be given to building thy father’s.’\nYet did I not comprehend thee until thou sentest thy mother\nUnto my father, and quick were the happy espousals accomplished.\nE’en to this day I remember with joy those half-consumed timbers,\nAnd I can see once more the sun coming up in such splendor;\nFor ’twas the day that gave me my husband; and, ere the first season\nPassed of that wild desolation, a son to my youth had been given.\nTherefore I praise thee, Hermann, that thou, with an honest assurance,\nShouldst, in these sorrowful days, be thinking thyself of a maiden,\nAnd amid ruins and war shouldst thus have the courage to woo her.”",
        "Straightway, then, and with warmth, the father replied to her, saying:\n\"Worthy of praise is the feeling, and truthful also the story,\nMother, that thou hast related; for so indeed everything happened.\nBetter, however, is better. It is not the business of all men\nThus their life and estate to begin from the very foundation:\nEvery one needs not to worry himself as we and the rest did.\nOh, how happy is he whose father and mother shall give him,\nFurnished and ready, a house which he can adorn with his increase.\nEvery beginning is hard; but most the beginning a household.\nMany are human wants, and every thing daily grows dearer,\nSo that a man must consider the means of increasing his earnings.\nThis I hope therefore of thee, my Hermann, that into our dwelling\nThou wilt be bringing ere long a bride who is handsomely dowered;\nFor it is meet that a gallant young man have an opulent maiden.\nGreat is the comfort of home whene’er, with the woman elected,\nEnter the useful presents, besides, in box and in basket.\nNot for this many a year in vain has the mother been busy\nMaking her daughter’s linens of strong and delicate texture;\nGod-parents have not in vain been giving their vessels of silver,\nAnd the father laid by in his desk the rare pieces of money;\nFor there a day will come when she, with her gifts and possessions,\nShall that youth rejoice who has chosen her out of all others.\nWell do I know how good in a house is a woman’s position,\nWho her own furniture round her knows, in kitchen and chamber;\nWho herself the bed and herself the table has covered.\nOnly a well-dowered bride should I like to receive to my dwelling.\nShe who is poor is sure, in the end, to be scorned by her husband;\nAnd will as servant be held, who as servant came in with her bundle.\nMen will remain unjust when the season of love is gone over.\nYes, my Hermann, thy father’s old age thou greatly canst gladden,\nIf thou a daughter-in-law will speedily bring to my dwelling,\nOut of the neighborhood here,—from the house over yonder, the green one.\nRich is the man, I can tel1 thee. His manufactures and traffic\nDaily are making him richer; for whence draws the merchant not profit?\nThree daughters only he has, to divide his fortune among them.\nTrue that the eldest already is taken; but there is the second\nStill to be had, as well as the third; and not long so, it may be.\nI would never have lingered till now, had I been in thy place;\nBut had fetched one of the maidens, as once I bore off thy dear mother.\"\nModestly then did the son to the urgent father answer;\n\"Truly ’twas my wish too, as well as thine own, to have chosen\nOne of our neighbor’s daughters, for we had been brought up together;\nPlayed, in the early days, about the market-place fountain;\nAnd, from the other boys’ rudeness, I often have been their defender.\nThat, though, is long since past: the girls, as they grew to be older,\nProperly stayed in the house, and shunned the more boisterous pastimes.\nWell brought up are they, surely! I used sometimes to go over,\nPartly to gratify thee, and because of our former acquaintance:\nBut no pleasure I ever could take in being among them;\nFor I was always obliged to endure their censures upon me.\nQuite too long was my coat, the cloth too coarse, and the color\nQuite too common; my hair was not cropped, as it should be, and frizzled.\nI was resolved, at last, that I, also, would dress myself finely,\nJust as those office-boys do who always are seen there on Sundays,\nWearing in summer their half-silken flaps, that dangled about them;\nBut I discovered, betimes, they made ever a laughing-stock of me.\nAnd I was vexed when I saw it,—it wounded my pride; but more deeply\nFelt I aggrieved that they the good-will should so far misinterpret\nThat in my heart I bore them,—especially Minna the youngest.\nIt was on Easter-day that last I went over to see them;\nWearing my best new coat, that is now hanging up in the closet,\nAnd having frizzled my hair, like that of the other young fellows.\nSoon as I entered, they tittered; but that not at me, as I fancied.\nMinna before the piano was seated; the father was present,\nHearing his daughters sing, and full of delight and good-humor.\nMuch I could not understand of all that was said in the singing;\nBut of Pamina I often heard, and oft of Tamino:\nAnd I, besides, could not stay there dumb; so, as soon as she ended,\nSomething about the words I asked, and about the two persons.\nThereupon all were silent and smiled; but the father made answer:\n’Thou knowest no one, my friend, I believe, but Adam and Eve?’\nNo one restrained himself longer, but loud laughed out then the maidens,\nLoud laughed out the boys, the old man held his sides for his laughing.\nI, in embarrassment, dropped my hat, and the giggling continued,\nOn and on and on, for all they kept playing and singing.\nBack to the house here I hurried, o’ercome with shame and vexation,\nHung up my coat in the closet, and pulled out the curls with my fingers,\nSwearing that never again my foot should cross over that threshold.\nAnd I was perfectly right; for vain are the maidens, and heartless.\nE’en to this day, as I hear, I am called by them ever ’Tamino.’”",
        "Thereupon answered the mother, and said: “Thou shouldest not, Hermann,\nBe so long vexed with the children: indeed, they are all of them children.\nMinna, believe me, is good, and was always disposed to thee kindly.\n’Twas not long since she was asking about thee. Let her be thy chosen!”",
        "Thoughtfully answered the son: “I know not. That mortification\nStamped itself in me so deeply, I never could bear to behold her\nSeated before the piano or listen again to her singing.”",
        "Forth broke the father then, and in words of anger made answer:\n\"Little of joy will my life have in thee! I said it would be so\nWhen I perceived that thy pleasure was solely in horses and farming:\nWork which a servant, indeed, performs for an opulent master,\nThat thou doest; the father meanwhile must his son be deprived of,\nWho should appear as his pride, in the sight of the rest of the townsmen.\nEarly with empty hopes thy mother was wont to deceive me,\nWhen in the school thy studies, thy reading and writing, would never\nAs with the others succeed, but thy seat would he always the lowest.\nThat comes about, forsooth, when a youth has no feeling of honor\nDwelling within his breast, nor the wish to raise himself higher.\nHad but my father so cared for me as thou hast been cared for;\nIf he had sent me to school, and provided me thus with instructors,\nI should be other, I trow, than host of the Golden Lion!”",
        "Then the son rose from his seat and noiselessly moved to the doorway,\nSlowly, and speaking no word. The father, however; in passion\nAfter him called, “Yes, go, thou obstinate fellow! I know thee!\nGo and look after the business henceforth, that I have not to chide thee;\nBut do thou nowise imagine that ever a peasant-born maiden\nThou for a daughter-in-law shalt bring into my dwelling, the hussy!\nLong have I lived in the world, and know how mankind should be dealt with;\nKnow how to entertain ladies and gentlemen so that contented\nThey shall depart from my house, and strangers agreeably can flatter.\nYet I’m resolved that some day I one will have for a daughter,\nWho shall requite me in kind and sweeten my manifold labors;\nWho the piano shall play to me, too; so that there shall with pleasure\nAll the handsomest people in town and the finest assemble,\nAs they on Sundays do now in the house of our neighbor.” Here Hermann\nSoftly pressed on the latch, and so went out from the chamber.",
        "Thus did the modest son slip away from the angry upbraiding;\nBut in the tone he had taken at first, the father continued:\n\"That comes not out of a man which he has not in him; and hardly\nShall the joy ever be mine of seeing my dearest wish granted:\nThat my son may not as his father be, but a better.\nWhat would become of the house, and what of the city if each one\nWere not with pleasure and always intent on maintaining, renewing,\nYea, and improving, too, as time and the foreigner teach us!\nMan is not meant, forsooth, to grow from the ground like a mushroom,\nQuickly to perish away on the spot of ground that begot him,\nLeaving no trace behind of himself and his animate action!\nAs by the house we straightway can tell the mind of the master,\nSo, when we walk through a city, we judge of the persons who rule it.\nFor where the towers and walls are falling to ruin; where offal\nLies in heaps in the gutters, and alleys with offal are littered;\nWhere from its place has started the stone, and no one resets it;\nWhere the timbers are rotting away, and the house is awaiting\nVainly its new supports,—that place we may know is ill governed.\nSince if not from above work order and cleanliness downward,\nEasily grows the citizen used to untidy postponement;\nJust as the beggar grows likewise used to his ragged apparel.\nTherefore I wished that our Hermann might early set out on some travels;\nThat he at least might behold the cities of Strasburg and Frankfort,\nFriendly Mannheim, too, that is cheerful and evenly builded.\nHe that has once beheld cities so cleanly and large, never after\nCeases his own native city, though small it may be, to embellish.\nDo not the strangers who come here commend the repairs in our gateway,\nNotice our whitewashed tower, and the church we have newly rebuilded?\nAre not all praising our pavement? the covered canals full of water,\nLaid with a wise distribution, which furnish us profit and safety,\nSo that no sooner does fire break out than ’tis promptly arrested?\nHas not all this come to pass since the time of our great conflagration?\nBuilder I six times was named by the council, and won the approval,\nWon moreover the heartfelt thanks of all the good burghers,\nActively carrying out what I planned, and also fulfilling\nWhat had by upright men been designed, and left uncompleted.\nFinally grew the same zeal in every one of the council;\nAll now labor together, and firmly decided already\nStands it to build the new causeway that shall with the highroad connect us.\nBut I am sorely afraid that will not be the way with our children.\nSome think only of pleasure and perishable apparel;\nOthers will cower at home, and behind the stove will sit brooding.\nOne of this kind, as I fear, we shall find to the last in our Hermann.”",
        "Straightway answered and said the good and intelligent mother:\n\"Why wilt thou always, father, be doing our son such injustice?\nThat least of all is the way to bring thy wish to fulfilment.\nWe have no power to fashion our children as suiteth our fancy;\nAs they are given by God, we so must have them and love them;\nTeach them as best we can, and let each of them follow his nature.\nOne will have talents of one sort, and different talents another.\nEvery one uses his own; in his own individual fashion,\nEach must be happy and good. I will not have my Hermann found fault with;\nFor he is worthy, I know, of the goods he shall one day inherit;\nWill be an excellent landlord, a pattern to burghers and builders;\nNeither in council, as I can foresee, will he be the most backward.\nBut thou keepest shut up in his breast all the poor fellow’s spirit,\nFinding such fault with him daily, and censuring as thou but now hast.\"\nAnd on the instant she quitted the room, and after him hurried,\nHoping she somewhere might find him, and might with her words of affection\nCheer him again, her excellent son, for well he deserved it.",
        "Thereupon when she was gone, the father thus smiling continued:\n\"What a strange folk, to be sure, are these women; and just like the children;\nBoth of them bent upon living according as suiteth their pleasure,\nWhile we others must never do aught but flatter and praise them.\nOnce for all time holds good the ancients’ trustworthy proverb:\n’Whoever goes not forward comes backward.’ So must it be always.”",
        "Thereupon answered and said, in a tone of reflection, the doctor:\n\"That, sir neighbor, I willingly grant; for myself I am always\nCasting about for improvement,—things new, so they be not too costly.\nBut what profits a man, who has not abundance of money,\nBeing thus active and stirring, and bettering inside and outside?\nOnly too much is the citizen cramped: the good, though he know it,\nHas he no means to acquire because too slender his purse is,\nWhile his needs are too great; and thus is he constantly hampered.\nMany the things I had done; but then the cost of such changes\nWho does not fear, especially now in this season of danger?\nLong since my house was smiling upon me in modish apparel!\nLong since great panes of glass were gleaming in all of the windows!\nBut who can do as the merchant does, who, with his resources,\nKnows the methods as well by which the best is arrived at?\nLook at that house over yonder,—the new one; behold with what splendor\n’Gainst the background of green stand out the white spirals of stucco!\nGreat are the panes in the windows; and how the glass sparkles and glitters,\nCasting quite into the shade the rest of the market-place houses!\nYet just after the fire were our two houses the finest,\nThis of the Golden Lion, and mine of the sign of the Angel.\nSo was my garden, too, throughout the whole neighborhood famous:\nEvery traveller stopped and gazed through the red palisadoes,\nCaught by the beggars there carved in stone and the dwarfs of bright colors.\nThen whosoever had coffee served in the beautiful grotto,—\nStanding there now all covered with dust and Partly in ruins,—\nUsed to be mightily pleased with the glimmering light of the mussels\nSpread out in beautiful order; and even the eye of the critic\nUsed by the sight of my corals and potter’s ore to be dazzled.\nSo in my parlor, too, they would always admire the painting,\nWhere in a garden are gaily dressed ladies and gentlemen walking,\nAnd with their taper fingers are plucking and holding the flowers.\nBut who would look at it now! In sooth, so great my vexation\nScarcely I venture abroad. All now must be other and tasteful,\nSo they call it; and white are the laths and benches of wood-work;\nEverything simple and smooth; no carving longer or gilding\nCan be endured, and the woods from abroad are of all the most costly.\nWell, I too should be glad could I get for myself something novel;\nGlad to keep up with the times, and be changing my furniture often;\nYet must we all be afraid of touching the veriest trifle.\nFor who among us has means for paying the work-people’s wages\nLately I had an idea of giving the Archangel Michael,\nMaking the sign of my shop, another fresh coating of gilding,\nAnd to the terrible dragon about his feet that is winding;\nBut I e’en let him stay browned as he is: I dreaded the charges.”",
        "Thus entertaining themselves, the men sat talking. The mother\nWent meanwhile to look for her son in front of the dwelling,\nFirst on the settle of stone, whereon ’twas his wont to he seated.\nWhen she perceived him not there, she went farther to look in the stable,\nIf he were caring perhaps for his noble horses, the stallions,\nWhich he as colts had bought, and whose care he intrusted to no one.\nAnd by the servant she there was told: He is gone to the garden.\nThen with a nimble step she traversed the long, double courtyards,\nLeaving the stables behind, and the well-builded barns, too, behind her;\nEntered the garden, that far as the walls of the city extended;\nWalked through its length, rejoiced as she went in every thing growing;\nSet upright the supports on which were resting the branches\nHeavily laden with apples, and burdening boughs of the pear-tree.\nNext some caterpillars removed from a stout, swelling cabbage;\nFor an industrious woman allows no step to be wasted.\nThus was she come at last to the end of the far-reaching garden,\nWhere stood the arbor embowered in woodbine; nor there did she find him,\nMore than she had hitherto in all her search through the garden.\nBut the wicket was standing ajar, which out of the arbor,\nOnce by particular favor, had been through the walls of the city\nCut by a grandsire of hers, the worshipful burgomaster.\nSo the now dried-up moat she next crossed over with comfort,\nWhere, by the side of the road, direct the well-fencd vineyard,\nRose with a steep ascent, its slope exposed to the sunshine.\nUp this also she went, and with pleasure as she was ascending\nMarked the wealth of the clusters, that scarce by their leafage were hidden.\nShady and covered the way through the lofty middlemost alley,\nWhich upon steps that were made of unhewn blocks you ascended.\nThere were the Muscatel, and there were the Chasselas hanging\nSide by side, of unusual size and colored with purple,\nAll set out with the purpose of decking the visitor’s table;\nWhile with single vine-stocks the rest of the hillside was covered,\nBearing inferior clusters, from which the delicate wine comes.\nThus up the slope she went, enjoying already the vintage,\nAnd that festive clay on which the whole country, rejoicing,\nPicks and tramples the grapes, and gathers the must into vessels:\nFireworks, when it is evening, from every direction and corner\nCrackle and blaze, and so the fairest of harvests is honored.\nBut more uneasy she went, her son after twice or thrice calling,\nAnd no answer receiving, except from the talkative echo,\nThat with many repeats rang back from the towers of the city.",
        "Strange it was for her to seek him; he never had gone to a distance\nThat he told her not first, to spare his affectionate mother\nEvery anxious thought, and fear that aught ill had befallen.\nStill did she constantly hope that, if further she went, she should find him;\nFor the two doors of the vineyard, the lower as well as the upper,\nBoth were alike standing open. So now she entered the cornfield,\nThat with its broad expanse the ridge of the hill covered over.\nStill was the ground that she walked on her own; and the crops she rejoiced in,—\nAll of them still were hers, and hers was the proud-waving grain, too,\nOver the whole broad field in golden strength that was stirring.\nKeeping the ridgeway, the footpath, between the fields she went onward,\nHaving the lofty pear-tree in view, which stood on the summit,\nAnd was the boundary-mark of the fields that belonged to her dwelling.\nWho might have planted it, none could know, but visible was it\nFar and wide through the country; the fruit of the pear-tree was famous.\n’Neath it the reapers were wont to enjoy their meal at the noon-day,\nAnd the shepherds were used to tend their flocks in its shadow.\nBenches of unhewn stones and of turf they found set about it.\nAnd she had not been mistaken, for there sat her Hermann, and rested,—\nSat with his head on his hand, and seemed to be viewing the landscape\nThat to the mountains lay: his back was turned to his mother.\nTowards him softly she crept, and lightly touched on the shoulder;\nQuick he turned himself round: there were tears in his eyes as he met her.",
        "“Mother, how hast thou surprised me!” he said in confusion; and quickly\nWiped the high-spirited youth his tears away. But the mother,\n\"What! do I find thee weeping, my son?” exclaimed in amazement.\n\"Nay, that is not like thyself: I never before have so seen thee!\nTell me, what burdens thy heart? what drives thee here, to be sitting\nUnder the pear-tree alone? These tears in thine eyes, what has brought them?”",
        "Then, collecting himself, the excellent youth made her answer:\n\"Truly no heart can that man have in his bosom of iron,\nWho is insensible now to the needs of this emigrant people;\nHe has no brains in his head, who not for his personal safety,\nNot for his fatherland’s weal, in days like the present is anxious.\nDeeply my heart had been touched by the sights and sounds of the morning;\nThen I went forth and beheld the broad and glorious landscape\nSpreading its fertile slopes in every direction about us,\nSaw the golden grain inclining itself to the reapers,\nAnd the promise of well-filled barns from the plentiful harvest.\nBut, alas, how near is the foe! The Rhine with its waters\nGuards us, indeed; but, ah, what now are rivers and mountains\n’Gainst that terrible people that onward bears like a tempest!\nFor they summon their youths from every quarter together,\nCall up their old men too, and press with violence forward.\nDeath cannot frighten the crowd: one multitude follows another.\nAnd shall a German dare to linger behind in his homestead?\nHopes he perhaps to escape the everywhere threatening evil?\nNay, dear mother, I tell thee, to-day has made me regretful\nThat I was lately exempt, when out of our townsmen were chosen\nThose who should serve in the army. An only son I am truly,\nAlso our business is great, and the charge of our household is weighty.\nYet were it better, I deem, in the front to offer resistance\nThere on the border, than here to await disaster and bondage.\nSo has my spirit declared, and deep in my innermost bosom\nCourage and longing have now been aroused to live for my country,\nYea, and to die, presenting to others a worthy example.\nIf but the strength of Germany’s youth were banded together\nThere on the frontier, resolved that it never would yield to the stranger,\nAh, he should not on our glorious soil be setting his foot-steps,\nNeither consuming before our eyes the fruit of our labor,\nRuling our men, and making his prey of our wives and our daughters.\nHark to me, mother: for I in the depths of my heart am determined\nQuickly to do, and at once, what appears to me right and in reason;\nFor he chooses not always the best who longest considers.\nHearken, I shall not again return to the house; but directly\nGo from this spot to the city, and there present to the soldiers\nThis right arm and this heart, to be spent in the fatherland’s service.\nThen let my father say if there be no feeling of honor\nDwelling within my breast, nor a wish to raise myself higher.\"\nThen with significant words spoke the good and intelligent mother,\nWhile from her eyes the quick-starting tears were silently falling:\n\"Son, what change has come o’er thee to-day, and over thy temper,\nThat thou speakest no more, as thou yesterday didst, and hast always,\nOpen and free, to thy mother, and tellest exactly thy wishes?\nAny one else, had he heard thee thus speak, would in sooth have commended,\nAnd this decision of thine would have highly approved as most noble,\nBeing misled by thy tone and by thy significant language.\nYet have I nothing but censure to speak; for better I know thee.\nThou concealest thy heart, and thy thoughts are not such as thou tellest.\nWell do I know that it is not the drum, not the trumpet that calls thee:\nNeither in uniform wouldst thou figure in sight of the maidens;\nSince, for all thou art honest and brave, it is thy vocation\nHere in quiet to care for the farm and provide for the household.\nTell me honestly, therefore, what goads thee to such a decision?”",
        "Earnestly answered the son: “Nay, thou art mistaken, dear mother:\nOne day is not like another. The youth matures into manhood:\nBetter in stillness oft ripening to deeds than when in the tumult\nWildering and wild of existence, that many a youth has corrupted.\nAnd, for as still as I am and was always, there yet in my bosom\nHas such a heart been shaped as abhors all wrong and injustice;\nAnd I have learned aright between worldly things to distinguish.\nArm and foot, besides, have been mightily strengthened by labor.\nAll this, I feel, is true: I dare with bo1dness maintain it.\nYet dost thou blame me with reason, O mother! for thou hast surprised me\nUsing a language half truthful and half that of dissimulation.\nFor, let me honestly own,—it is not the near danger that calls me\nForth from my father’s house; nor is it the lofty ambition\nHelpful to be to my country, and terrible unto the foeman.\nThey were but words that I spoke: they only were meant for concealing\nThose emotions from thee with which my heart is distracted;\nAnd so leave me, O mother! for, since the wishes are fruitless\nWhich in my bosom I cherish, my life must go fruitlessly overover.\nFor, as I know, he injures himself who is singly devoted,\nWhen for the common cause the whole are not working together.”",
        "“Hesitate not,” replied thereupon the intelligent mother,\n\"Every thing to relate me, the smallest as well as the greatest.\nMen will always be hasty, their thoughts to extremes ever running:\nEasily out of their course the hasty are turned by a hindrance.\nWhereas a woman is clever in thinking of means, and will venture\nE’en on a roundabout way, adroitly to compass her object.\nLet me know every thin, then; say wherefore so greatly excited\n’As I ne’er saw thee before, why thy blood is coursing so hotly,\nWherefore, against thy will, tears are filling thine eyes to o’erflowing.”",
        "Then he abandoned himself, the poor boy, to his sorrow, and weeping,\nWeeping aloud on his kind mother’s breast, he brokenly answered:\n\"Truly my father’s words to-day have wounded me sorely,—\nWords which I have not deserved; not to-day, nor at any time have I:\nFor it was early my greatest delight to honor my parents.\nNo one knew more, so I deemed, or was wiser than those who begot me,\nAnd had with strictness ruled throughout the dark season of childhood.\nMany the things, in truth, I with patience endured from my playmates,\nWhen the good-will that I bore them they often requited with malice.\nOften I suffered their flings and their blows to pass unresented;\nBut if they ventured to ridicule father, when he of a Sunday\nHome from Church would come, with his solemn and dignified bearing;\nIf they made fun of his cap-string, or laughed at the flowers of the wrapper\nHe with such stateliness wore, which was given away but this morning,—\nThreateningly doubled my fist in an instant; with furious passion\nFell I upon them, and struck out and hit, assailing them blindly,\nSeeing not where. They howled as the blood gushed out from their noses:\nScarcely they made their escape from my passionate kicking and beating.\nThen, as I older grew, I had much to endure from my father;\nViolent words he oft vented on me, instead of on others,\nWhen, at the board’s last session, the council had roused his displeasure,\nAnd I was made to atone for the quarrels and wiles of his colleagues.\nThou has pitied me often thyself; for much did I suffer,\nEver remembering with cordial respect the kindness of parents,\nSolely intent on increasing for us their goods and possessions,\nMuch denying themselves in order to save for their children.\nBut, alas! saving alone, for the sake of a tardy enjoyment,—\nThat is not happiness: pile upon pile, and acre on acre,\nMake us not happy, no matter how fair our estates may be rounded.\nFor the father grows old, and with him will grow old the children,\nLosing the joy of the day, and bearing the care of tomorrow.\nLook thou below, and see how before us in glory are lying,\nFair and abundant, the corn-fields; beneath them, the vineyard and garden;\nYonder the stables and barns; our beautiful line of possessions.\nBut when I look at the dwelling behind, where up in the gable\nWe can distinguish the window that marks my room in the attic;\nWhen I look back, and remember how many a night from that window\nI for the moon have watched; for the sun, how many a morning!\nWhen the healthful sleep of a few short hours sufficed me,—\nAh, so lonely they seem to me then, the chamber and courtyard,\nGarden and glorious field, away o’er the hill that is stretching;\nAll so desert before me lie: ’tis the wife that is wanting.”",
        "Thereupon spoke the good mother, and thus with intelligence answered:\n\"Son, not greater thy wish to bring thee a bride to thy chamber,\nThat thou mayst find thy nights a beautiful part of existence,\nAnd that the work of the day may gain independence and freedom,\nThan is thy father’s wish too, and thy mother’s. We always have counselled,—\nYea, we have even insisted,—that thou shouldst select thee a maiden.\nBut I was ever aware, and now my heart gives me assurance,\nThat till the hour appointed is come, and the maiden appointed\nShall with the hour appear, the choice will be left for the future,\nWhile more strong than all else will be fear of grasping the wrong one.\nIf I may say it, my son, I believe thou already hast chosen;\nFor thy heart has been touched, and been made more than wontedly tender.\nSpeak it out honestly, then; for my soul has told me beforehand:\nThat same maiden it is, the exile, whom thou hast elected.”",
        "“Thou has said, mother!” the son thereupon with eagerness answered.\n\"Yes, it is she; and if I to-day as my bride do not bring her\nHome to our dwelling, she from me will go, perhaps vanish for ever,\nLost in the war’s confusion and sad movings hither and thither.\nMother, for ever in vain would then our abundant possessions\nProsper before me, and seasons to come be in vain to me fruitful.\nYea, I should hold in aversion the wonted house and the garden:\nEven my mother’s love, alas! would not comfort my sorrow.\nEvery tie, so I feel in my heart, by love is unloosened\nSoon as she fastens her own; and not the maid is it only\nLeaves behind father and mother, to follow the man she has chosen.\nHe too, the youth, no longer knows aught of mother and father,\nWhen he the maiden, his only beloved, sees vanishing from him.\nSuffer me, then, to go hence wherever despair shall impel me:\nSince by my father himself the decisive words have been spoken;\nSince his house can no longer be mine if he shut out the maiden,\nHer whom alone as my bride I desire to bring to our dwelling.”",
        "Thereupon quickly made answer the good and intelligent mother:\n\"How like to rocks, forsooth, two men will stand facing each other!\nProud and not to be moved, will neither draw near to his fellow;\nNeither will stir his tongue to utter the first word of kindness.\nTherefore I tell thee, my son, a hope yet lives in my bosom,\nSo she be honest and good, thy father will let thee espouse her,\nEven though poor, and against a poor girl so decisive his sentence.\nMany a thing he is wont to speak out in his violent fashion\nWhich he yet never performs; and so what he denies will consent to.\nYet he requires a kindly word, and is right to require it: He is the father!\nBesides we know that his wrath after dinner,—\nWhen he most hastily speaks, and questions all others’ opinions,—\nSignifies naught; the full force of his violent will is excited\nThen by the wine, which lets him not heed the language of others;\nNone but himself does he see and feel. But now is come evening,\nTalk upon various subjects has passed between him and his neighbors.\nGentle, he is; I am sure now his little excitement is over,\nAnd he can feel how unjust his passion has made him to others.\nCome, let us venture at once: success is alone to the valiant!\nFurther we need the friends, still sitting together there with him,;\nAnd in especial the worthy pastor will give us assistance.”",
        "Thus she hastily spoke, and up from the stone then arising,\nDrew from his seat her son, who willingly followed. In silence\nBoth descended the hill, their important purpose revolving.",
        "Here the three men, however, still sat conversing together,\nWith mine host of the Lion, the village doctor, and pastor;\nAnd their talk was still on the same unvarying subject,\nTurning it this way and that, and viewing from every direction.\nBut with his sober judgment the excellent pastor made answer:\n\"Here will I not contradict you. I know that man should be always\nStriving for that which is better; indeed, as we see, he is reaching\nAlways after the higher, at least some novelty craving.\nBut be careful ye go not too far, for with this disposition\nNature has given us pleasure in holding to what is familiar;\nTaught us in that to delight to which we have long been accustomed.\nEvery condition is good that is founded on reason and nature.\nMany are man’s desires, yet little it is that he needeth;\nSeeing the days are short and mortal destiny bounded.\nNe’er would I censure the man whom a restless activity urges,\nBold and industrious, over all pathways of land and of ocean,\nEver untiring to roam; who takes delight in the riches,\nHeaping in generous abundance about himself and his children.\nYet not unprized by me is the quiet citizen also,\nMaking the noiseless round of his own inherited acres,\nTilling the ground as the ever-returning seasons command him.\nNot with every year is the soil transfigured about him;\nNot in haste does the tree stretch forth, as soon as ’tis planted,\nFull-grown arms towards heaven and decked with plenteous blossoms.\nNo: man has need of patience, and needful to him are also\nCalmness and clearness of mind, and a pure and right understanding.\nFew are the seeds he intrusts to earth’s all-nourishing bosom;\nFew are the creatures he knows how to raise and bring to perfection.\nCentred are all his thoughts alone on that which is useful.\nHappy to whom by nature a mind of such temper is given,\nFor he supports us all! And hail, to the man whose abode is\nWhere in a town the country pursuits with the city are blended.\nOn him lies not the pressure that painfully hampers the farmer,\nNor is he carried away by the greedy ambition of cities;\nWhere they of scanty possessions too often are given to aping,\nWives and daughters especially, those who are higher and richer.\nBlessed be therefore thy son in his life of quiet employment;\nBlessed the wife, of like mind with himself, whom he one day shall choose him.”",
        "Thus he spoke; and scarce had he ended when entered the mother,\nHolding her son by the hand, and so led him up to her husband.\n\"Father,” she said, “how oft when we two have been chatting together,\nHave we rejoiced in the thought of Hermann’s future espousal,\nWhen he should bring his bride to be the light of our dwelling!\nOver and over again the matter we pondered: this maiden\nFixing upon for him first, and then that, with the gossip of parents.\nBut that day is now come; and Heaven at last has the maiden\nBrought to him hither, and shown him; and now his heart has decided.\nSaid we not always then he should have his own choice in the matter?\nWas it not just now thy wish that he might with lively affection\nFeel himself drawn to some maiden? The hour is come that we hoped for.\nYes; he has felt and has chosen and come to a manly decision.\nThat same maiden it is that met him this morning, the stranger:\nSay he may have her, or else, as he swears, his life shall be single.”",
        "“Give her me, father,” so added the son: “my heart has elected\nClear and sure; she will be to you both the noblest of daughters.”",
        "But the father was silent. Then hastily rose the good pastor,\nTook up the word and said: “The moment alone is decisive;\nFixes the life of man, and his future destiny settles.\nAfter long taking of counsel, yet only the work of a moment\nEvery decision must be; and the wise alone seizes the right one.\nDangerous always it is comparing the one with the other\nWhen we are making our choice, and so confusing our feelings.\nHermann is pure. From childhood up I have known him, and never\nE’en as a boy was he wont to be reaching for this and the other:\nWhat he desired was best for him too, and he held to it firmly.\nBe not surprised and alarmed that now has appeared of a sudden,\nWhat thou hast wished for so long. It is true that the present appearance\nBears not the form of the wish, exactly as thou hadst conceived it:\nFor our wishes oft hide from ourselves the object we wish for;\nGifts come down from above in the shapes appointed by Heaven.\nTherefore misjudge not the maiden who now of thy dearly beloved,\nGood and intelligent son has been first to touch the affections:\nHappy to whom at once his first love’s hand shall be given,\nAnd in whose heart no tenderest wish must secretly languish.\nYes: his whole bearing assures me that now his fate is decided.\nGenuine love matures in a moment the youth into manhood;\nHe is not easily moved; and I fear that if this be refused him,\nSadly his years will go by, those years that should be the fairest,”",
        "Straightway then in a thoughtful tone the doctor made answer,\nOn whose tongue for a long time past the words had been trembling:\n\"Pray let us here as before pursue the safe middle course only.\nMake haste slowly: that was Augustus the emperor’s motto.\nWillingly I myself place at my well-beloved neighbor’s disposal,\nReady to do him what service I can with my poor understanding.\nYouth most especially stands in need of some one to guide it.\nLet me therefore go forth that I may examine the maiden,\nAnd may question the people among whom she lives and who know her.\nMe ’tis not easy to cheat: I know how words should be valued.”",
        "Straightway the son broke in, and with wing’ed words made he answer:\n\"Do so, neighbor, and go and make thine inquiries; but with thee\nI should be glad if our minister here were joined in the errand:\nTwo such excellent men would be irreproachable judges.\nO my father! believe me, she’s none of those wandering maidens,\nNot one of those who stroll through the land in search of adventure,\nAnd who seek to ensnare inexperienced youth in their meshes.\nNo: the hard fortunes of war, that universal destroyer,\nWhich is convulsing the earth and has hurled from its deep foundations\nMany a structure already, have sent the poor girl into exile.\nAre not now men of high birth, the most noble, in misery roaming?\nPrinces fly in disguise and kings are in banishment living.\nSo alas! also is she, the best among all of her sisters,\nDriven an exile from home; yet, her personal sorrows forgetting,\nShe is devoted to others; herself without help, she is helpful.\nGreat is the want and the suffering over the earth that are spreading:\nShall not some happiness, too, be begotten of all this affliction,\nAnd shall not I in the arms of my wife, my trusted companion,\nLook back with joy to the war, as do ye to the great conflagration?”",
        "Outspoke the father then in a tone of decision, and answered:\n\"Strangely thy tongue has been loosened, my son, which many a year past\nSeemed to have stuck in thy mouth, and only to move on compulsion!\nI must experience to-day, it would seem, what threatens all fathers,\nThat the son’s headstrong will the mother with readiness favors,\nShowing too easy indulgence; and every neighbor sides with them\nWhen there is aught to be carried against the father and husband.\nBut I will not oppose you, thus banded together: how could I?\nFor I already perceive here tears and defiance beforehand.\nGo ye therefore, inquire, in God’s name, bring me the daughter.\nBut if not so, then the boy is to think no more of the maiden.”",
        "Thus the father. The son cried out with joyful demeanor,\n\"Ere it is evening the noblest of daughters shall hither be brought you,\nSuch as no man with sound sense in his breast can fail to be pleased with.\nHappy, I venture to hope, will be also the excellent maiden.\nYes; she will ever be grateful for having had father and mother\nGiven once more in you, and such as a child most delights in.\nNow I will tarry no longer, but straightway harness the horses,\nDrive forth our friends at once on the footsteps of my beloved,\nLeaving them then to act for themselves, as their wisdom shall dictate,\nGuide myself wholly, I promise, according to what they determine,\nAnd, until I may call her my own, ne’er look on the maiden.\"\nThus he went forth: the others meanwhile remained in discussion,\nRapid and earnest, considering deeply their great undertaking.",
        "Hermann hasted straightway to the stable, where quietly standing\nFound he the spirited stallions, the clean oats quickly devouring,\nAnd the well-dried hay that was cut from the richest of meadows.\nOn them without delay the shining bits he adjusted,\nHastily drew the straps through the buckles of beautiful plating,\nFirmly fastened then the long broad reins, and the horses\nLed without to the court-yard, whither the willing assistant\nHad with ease, by the pole, already drawn forward the carriage.\nNext to the whipple-tree they with care by the neatly kept traces\nJoined the impetuous strength of the freely travelling horses.\nWhip in hand took Hermann his seat and drove under the doorway.\nSoon as the friends straightway their commodious places had taken,\nQuickly the carriage rolled off, and left the pavement behind it,\nLeft behind it the walls of the town and the fresh-whitened towers.\nThus drove Hermann on till he came to the well-known causeway.\nRapidly, loitering nowhere, but hastening up hill and down hill.\nBut as he now before him perceived the spire of the village,\nAnd no longer remote the garden-girt houses were lying,\nThen in himself he thought that here he would rein up the horses.",
        "Under the solemn shade of lofty linden-trees lying,\nWhich for centuries past upon this spot had been rooted,\nSpread in front of the village a broad and grass-covered common,\nFavorite place of resort for the peasants and neighboring townsfolk.\nHere, at the foot of the trees, sunk deep in the ground was a well-spring;\nWhen you descended the steps, stone benches you found at the bottom,\nStationed about the spring, whose pure, living waters were bubbling\nCeaselessly forth, hemmed in by low walls for convenience of drawing.\nHermann resolved that here he would halt, with his horses and carriage,\nUnder the shade of the trees. He did so, and said to the others;\n\"Here alight, my friends, and go your ways to discover\nWhether the maiden in truth be worthy the hand that I offer.\nThat, she is so, I believe; naught new or strange will ye tell me.\nHad I to act for myself, I should go with speed to the village,\nWhere a few words from the maiden’s own lips should determine my fortune.\nYe will with readiness single her out from all of the others,\nFor there can scarcely be one that to her may be likened in bearing.\nBut I will give you, besides, her modest attire for a token:\nMark, then, the stomacher’s scarlet, that sets off the arch of her bosom,\nPrettily laced, and the bodice of black fitting close to her figure;\nNeatly the edge of her kerchief is plaited into a ruffle,\nWhich with a simple grace her chin’s rounded outline encircles;\nFreely and lightly rises above it the head’s dainty oval;\nAnd her luxuriant hair over silver bodkins is braided;\nDown from under her bodice, the full, blue petticoat falling,\nWraps itself, when she is walking, about her neatly shaped ankles.\nYet one thing will I say, and would make it my earnest petition,—\nSpeak not yourselves with the maiden, nor let your intent be discovered;\nRather inquire of others, and hearken to what they may tell you.\nWhen ye have tidings enough to satisfy father and mother,\nThen return to me here, and we will consider what further.\nSo did I plan it all out in my mind while driving you hither.”",
        "Thus he spoke. The friends thereupon went their way to the village,\nWhere, in the houses and gardens and barns, the people were swarming;\nWagons on wagons stood crowded together along the broad highway.\nMen for the harnessed horses and lowing cattle were caring,\nWhile the women were busy in drying their clothes on the hedges,\nAnd in the running brook the children were merrily splashing.\nMaking their way through the pressure of wagons, of people and cattle,\nWent the commissioned spies, and to right and to left looked about them,\nIf they a figure might see that answered the maiden’s description;\nBut not one of them all appeared the beautiful damsel.\nDenser soon grew the press. A contest arose round the wagons\n’Mongst the threatening men, wherein blended the cries of the women.\nRapidly then to the spot, and with dignified step, came an elder,\nJoined the clamoring group, and straightway the uproar was silenced,\nAs he commanded peace, and rebuked with a fatherly sternness.\n\"Has, then, misfortune,” he cried, “not yet so bound us together,\nThat we have finally learned to bear and forbear one another,\nThough each one, it may be, do not measure his share of the labor?\nHe that is happy, forsooth, is contentious! Will sufferings never\nTeach you to cease from your brawls of old between brother and brother?\nGrudge not one to another a place on the soil of the stranger;\nRather divide what ye have, as yourselves, ye would hope to find mercy.”",
        "Thus spoke the man and all became silent: restored to good humor,\nPeaceably then the people arranged their cattle and wagons.\nBut when the clergyman now had heard what was said by the stranger,\nAnd had the steadfast mind of the foreign justice discovered,\nHe to the man drew near and with words of meaning addressed him:\n\"True it is, father, that when in prosperity people are living,\nFeeding themselves from the earth, which far and wide opens her bosom,\nAnd in the years and months renews the coveted blessings,—\nAll goes on of itself, and each himself deems the wisest,\nDeems the best, and so they continue abiding together,\nHe of greatest intelligence ranking no higher than others;\nAll that occurs, as if of itself, going quietly forward.\nBut let disaster unsettle the usual course of existence,\nTear down the buildings about us, lay waste the crops and the garden,\nBanish the husband and wife from their old, familiar-grown dwelling,\nDrive them to wander abroad through nights and days of privation,—\nThen, ah then! we look round us to see what man is the wisest,\nAnd no longer in vain his glorious words will be spoken.\nTell me, art thou not judge among this fugitive people,\nFather, who thus in an instant canst bid their passions be quiet?\nThou dost appear to-day as one of those earliest leaders,\nWho through deserts and wanderings guided the emigrant nations.\nYea, I could even believe I were speaking with Joshua or Moses.”",
        "Then with serious look the magistrate answered him, saying:\n\"Truly our times might well be compared with all others in strangeness,\nWhich are in history mentioned, profane or sacred tradition;\nFor who has yesterday lived and to-day in times like the present,\nHe has already lived years, events are so crowded together.\nIf I look back but a little, it seems that my head must be hoary\nUnder the burden of years, and yet my strength is still active.\nWell may we of this day compare ourselves unto that people\nWho, from the burning bush, beheld in the hour of their danger\nGod the Lord: we also in cloud and in fire have beheld him.”",
        "Seeing the priest was inclined to speak yet more with the stranger,\nAnd was desirous of learning his story and that of his people,\nPrivately into his ear his companion hastily whispered:\n\"Talk with the magistrate further, and lead him to speak of the maiden.\nI, however, will wander in search, and as soon as I find her,\nCome and report to thee here.” The minister nodded, assenting;\nAnd through the gardens, hedges, and barns, went the spy on his errand.",
        "Now when the foreign judge had been by the minister questioned\nAs to his people’s distress, and how long their exile had lasted,\nThus made answer the man: “Of no recent date are our sorrows;\nSince of the gathering bitter of years our people have drunken,—\nBitterness all the more dreadful because such fair hope had been blighted.\nWho will pretend to deny that his heart swelled high in his bosom,\nAnd that his freer breast with purer pulses was beating;\nWhen we beheld the new sun arise in his earliest splender,\nWhen of the rights of men we heard, which to all should be common,\nWere of a righteous equality told, and inspiriting freedom?\nEvery one hoped that then he should live his own life, and the fetters,\nBinding the various lands, appeared their hold to be loosing,—\nFetters that had in the hand of sloth been held and self-seeking.\nLooked not the eyes of all nations, throughout that calamitous season,\nTowards the world’s capital city, for so it had long been considered,\nAnd of that glorious title was now, more than ever, deserving?",
        "Were not the names of those men who first delivered the message,\nNames to compare with the highest that under the heavens are spoken?\nDid not, in every man, grow courage and spirit and language?\nAnd, as neighbors, we, first of all, were zealously kindled.\nThereupon followed the war, and armed bodies of Frenchmen\nPressed to us nearer; yet nothing but friendship they seemed to be bringing;\nAy, and they brought it too; for exalted the spirit within them:\nThey with rejoicing the festive trees of liberty planted,\nPromising every man what was his own, and to each his own ruling.\nHigh beat the heart of the youths, and even the aged were joyful;\nGaily the dance began about the newly raised standard.\nThus had they speedily won, these overmastering Frenchmen,\nFirst the spirits of men by the fire and dash of their bearing,\nThen the hearts of the women with irresistible graces.\nEven the pressure of hungry war seemed to weigh on us lightly,\nSo before our vision did hope hang over the future,\nLuring our eyes abroad into newly opening pathways.\nOh, how joyful the time when with her belov’ed the maiden\nWhirls in the dance, the longed-for day of their union awaiting!\nBut more glorious that day on which to our vision the highest\nHeart of man can conceive seemed near and attainable to us.\nLoosened was every tongue, and men—the aged, the stripling—\nSpoke aloud in words that were full of high feeling and wisdom.\nSoon, however, the sky was o’ercast. A corrupt generation\nFought for the right of dominion, unworthy the good to establish;\nSo that they slew one another, their new-made neighbors and brothers\nHeld in subjection, and then sent the self-seeking masses against us.\nChiefs committed excesses and wholesale plunder upon us,\nWhile those lower plundered and rioted down to the lowest:\nEvery one seemed but to care that something be left for the morrow.\nGreat past endurance the need, and daily grew the oppression:\nThey were the lords of the day; there was none to hear our complaining.\nThen fell trouble and rage upon even the quietest spirit.\nOne thought only had all, and swore for their wrongs to have vengeance,\nAnd for the bitter loss of their hope thus doubly deluded.\nPresently Fortune turned and declared on the side of the German,\nAnd with hurried marches the French retreated before us.\nAh! then as never before did we feel the sad fortunes of warfare:\nHe that is victor is great and good,—or at least he appears SO,—\nAnd he, as one of his own, will spare the man he has conquered,\nHim whose service he daily needs, and whose property uses.\nBut no law the fugitive knows, save of self-preservation,\nAnd, with a reckless greed, consumes all the possessions about him;\nThen are his passions also inflamed: the despair that is in him\nOut of his heart breaks forth, and takes shape in criminal action.\nNothing is further held sacred; but all is for plunder. His craving\nTurns in fury on woman, and pleasure is changed into horror.\nDeath he sees everywhere round him, and madly enjoys his last moments,",
        "Taking delight in blood, in the shrieking of anguish exulting.\nThereupon fiercely arose in our men the stern resolution\nWhat had been lost to avenge, and defend whate’er was remaining,\nEvery man sprang to his arms, by the flight of the foeman encouraged,\nAnd by his blanching cheeks, and his timorous, wavering glances.\nCeaselessly now rang out the clanging peal of the tocsin.\nThought of no danger to come restrained their furious anger.\nQuick into weapons of war the husbandman’s peaceful utensils\nAll were converted; dripped with blood the scythe and the ploughshare.\nQuarter was shown to none: the enemy fell without mercy.\nFury everywhere raged and the cowardly cunning of weakness.\nNe’er may I men so carried away by injurious passion\nSee again! the sight of the raging wild beast would be better.\nLet not man prattle of freedom, as if himself he could govern!\nSoon as the barriers are torn away, then all of the evil\nSeems let loose, that by law had been driven deep back into corners.”",
        "“Excellent man!” thereupon with emphasis answered the pastor:\n\"Though thou misjudgest mankind, yet can I not censure thee for it.\nEvil enough, I confess, thou hast had to endure from man’s passions,\nYet wouldst thou look behind over this calamitous season,\nThou wouldst acknowledge thyself how much good thou also hast witnessed.\nHow many excellent things that would in the heart have hidden,\nHad not danger aroused them, and did not necessity’s pressure\nBring forth the angel in man, and make him a god of deliv’rance.”",
        "Thereupon answered and said the reverend magistrate, smiling:\n\"There thou remindest me aptly of how we console the poor fellow,\nAfter his house has been burned, by recounting the gold and the silver\nMelted and scattered abroad in the rubbish, that still is remaining.\nLittle enough, it is true; but even that little is precious.\nThen will the poor wretch after it dig and rejoice if he find it.\nThus I likewise with happier thoughts will gratefully turn me\nTowards the few beautiful deeds of which I preserve the remembrance.\nYes, I will not deny, I have seen old quarrels forgotten,\nIll to avert from the state; I also have witnessed how friendship,\nLove of parent and child, can impossibilities venture;\nSeen how the stripling at once matured into man; how the aged\nGrew again young; and even the child into youth was developed,\nYea, and the weaker sex too, as we are accustomed to call it,\nShowed itself brave and strong and ready for every emergence.\nForemost among them all, one beautiful deed let me mention,\nBravely performed by the hand of a girl, an excellent maiden;\nWho, with those younger than she, had been left in charge of a farmhouse,\nSince there, also, the men had marched against the invader.\nSuddenly fell on the house a fugitive band of marauders,\nEager for booty, who crowded straightway to the room of the women.",
        "There they beheld the beautiful form of the fully grown maiden,\nLooked on the charming young girls, who rather might still be called children.\nSavage desire possessed them; at once with merciless passion\nThey that trembling band assailed and the high-hearted maiden.\nBut she had snatched in an instant the sword of one from its scabbard,\nFelled him with might to the ground, and stretched him bleeding before her.\nThen with vigorous strokes she bravely delivered the maidens,\nSmiting yet four of the robbers; who saved themselves only by flying.\nThen she bolted the gates, and, armed, awaited assistance.”",
        "Now when this praise the minister heard bestowed on the maiden,\nRose straightway for his friend a feeling of hope in his bosom,\nAnd he had opened his lips to inquire what further befell her,\nIf on this mournful flight she now with her people were present;\nWhen with a hasty step the village doctor approached them,\nTwitched the clergyman’s coat, and said in his ear in a whisper:\n\"I have discovered the maiden at last among several hundreds;\nBy the description I knew her, so come, let thine own eyes behold her!\nBring too the magistrate with thee, that so we may hear him yet further.\"\nBut as they turned to go, the justice was summoned to leave them,\nSent for by some of his people by whom his counsel was needed.",
        "Straightway the preacher, however, the lead of the doctor had followed\nUp to a gap in the fence where his finger he meaningly pointed.\n\"Seest thou the maiden?” he said: “she has made some clothes for the baby\nOut of the well-known chintz,—I distinguish it plainly; and further\nThere are the covers of blue that Hermann gave in his bundle.\nWell and quickly, forsooth, she has turned to advantage the presents.\nEvident tokens are these, and all else answers well the description.\nMark how the stomacher’s scarlet sets off the arch of her bosom,\nPrettily laced, and the bodice of black fits close to her figure;\nNeatly the edge of her kerchief is plaited into a ruffle,\nWhich, with a simple grace, her chin’s rounded outline encircles;\nFreely and lightly rises above it the bead’s dainty oval,\nAnd her luxuriant hair over silver bodkins is braided.\nNow she is sitting, yet still we behold her majestical stature,\nAnd the blue petticoat’s ample plaits, that down from her bosom\nHangs in abundant folds about her neatly shaped ankles,\nShe without question it is; come, therefore, and let us discover\nWhether she honest and virtuous be, a housewifely maiden.”",
        "Then, as the seated figure he studied, the pastor made answer:\n\"Truly, I find it no wonder that she so enchanted the stripling,\nSince, to a man’s experienced eye, she seems lacking in nothing.\nHappy to whom mother Nature a shape harmonious has given!",
        "Such will always commend him, and he can be nowhere a stranger.\nAll approach with delight, and all are delighted to linger,\nIf to the outward shape correspond but a courteous spirit.\nI can assure thee, in her the youth has found him a maiden,\nWho, in the days to come, his life shall gloriously brighten,\nStanding with womanly strength in every necessity by him.\nSurely the soul must be pure that inhabits a body so perfect,\nAnd of a happy old age such vigorous youth is the promise.”",
        "Thereupon answered and said the doctor in language of caution:\n\"Often appearances cheat; I like not to trust to externals.\nFor I have oft seen put to the test the truth of the proverb:\nTill thou a bushel of salt with a new acquaintance hast eaten,\nBe not too ready to trust him; for time alone renders thee certain\nHow ye shall fare with each other, and how well your friendship shall prosper.\nLet us then rather at first make inquiries among the good people\nBy whom the maiden is known, and who can inform us about her.”",
        "“Much I approve of thy caution,” the preacher replied as he followed.\n\"Not for ourselves is the suit, and ’tis delicate wooing for others.”",
        "Towards the good magistrate, then, the men directed their footsteps,\nWho was again ascending the street in discharge of his duties.",
        "Him the judicious pastor at once addressed and with caution.\n\"Look! we a maiden have here descried in the neighboring garden,\nUnder an apple-tree sitting, and making up garments for children",
        "Out of second-hand stuff that somebody doubtless has given;\nAnd we were pleased with her aspect: she seems like a girl to be trusted.\nTell us whatever thou knowest: we ask it with honest intentions.”",
        "Soon as the magistrate nearer had come, and looked into the garden,\n\"Her thou knowest already,” he said; “for when I was telling\nOf the heroic deed performed by the hand of that maiden,\nWhen she snatched the man’s sword, and delivered herself and her charges,\nThis was the one! she is vigorous born, as thou seest by her stature;\nYet she is good as strong, for her aged kinsman she tended\nUntil the day of his death, which was finally hastened by sorrow\nOver his city’s distress, and his own endangered possessions.\nAlso, with quiet submission, she bore the death of her lover,\nWho a high-spirited youth, in the earliest flush of excitement,\nKindled by lofty resolve to fight for a glorious freedom,\nHurried to Paris, where early a terrible death he encountered.\nFor as at home, so there, his foes were deceit and oppression.”",
        "Thus the magistrate spoke. The others saluted and thanked him,\nAnd from his purse a gold-piece the pastor drew forth:—for the silver\nHe had some hours before already in charity given,\nWhen he in mournful groups had seen the poor fugitives passing;—\nAnd to the magistrate handed it, saying: “Apportion the money\n’Mongst thy destitute people, and God vouchsafe it an increase.\"\nBut the stranger declined it, and, answering, said: “We have rescued\nMany a dollar among us, with clothing and other possessions,\nAnd shall return, as I hope, ere yet our stock is exhausted.”",
        "Then the pastor replied, and pressed the money upon him:\n\"None should be backward in giving in days like the present, and no one\nOught to refuse to accept those gifts which in kindness are offered.\nNone can tell how long he may hold what in peace he possesses,\nNone how much longer yet he shall roam through the land of the stranger,\nAnd of his farm be deprived, and deprived of the garden that feeds him.”",
        "“Ay, to be sure!” in his bustling way interrupted the doctor:\n\"If I had only some money about me, ye surely should have it,\nLittle and big; for certainly many among you must need it.\nYet I’ll not go without giving thee something to show what my will is,\nEven though sadly behind my good-will must lag the performance.\"\nThus, as he spoke, by its straps his embroidered pocket of leather,\nWhere his tobacco was kept, he drew forth,—enough was now in it\nSeveral pipes to fill,—and daintily opened, and portioned.\n\"Small is the gift,” he added. The justice, however, made answer:\n\"Good tobacco can ne’er to the traveller fail to be welcome.\"\nThen did the village doctor begin to praise his canaster.",
        "But the clergyman drew him away, and they quitted the justice.\n\"Let us make haste,” said the thoughtful man: “the youth’s waiting in torture;\nCome I let him hear, as soon as he may, the jubilant tidings.”",
        "So they hastened their steps, and came to where under the lindens\nHermann against the carriage was leaning. The horses were stamping\nWildly the turf; he held them in check, and, buried in musing,\nStood, into vacancy gazing before him; nor saw the two envoys,\nTill, as they came, they called out and made to him signals of triumph.\nE’en as far off as they then were, the doctor began to address him;\nBut they were presently nearer come and then the good pastor\nGrasped his hand and exclaimed, interrupting the word of his comrade:\n\"Hail to thee, O young man! thy true eye and heart have well chosen;\nJoy be to thee and the wife of thy youth; for of thee she is worthy.\nCome then and turn us the wagon, and drive straightway to the village,\nThere the good maid to woo, and soon bring her home to thy dwelling.”",
        "Still, however, the young man stood, without sign of rejoicing\nHearing his messenger’s words, though heavenly they were and consoling.\nDeeply he sighed as he said: “With hurrying wheels we came hither,\nAnd shall be forced, perchance, to go mortified homeward and slowly.\nFor disquiet has fallen upon me since here I’ve been waiting,\nDoubt and suspicion and all that can torture the heart of a lover.\nThink ye we have but to come, and that then the maiden will follow\nMerely because we are rich, while she is poor and an exile?",
        "Poverty, too, makes proud, when it comes unmerited! Active\nSeems she to be, and contented, and so of the world is she mistress.\nThink ye a maiden like her, with the manners and beauty that she has,\nCan into woman have grown, and no worthy man’s love have attracted?\nThink ye that love until now can have been shut out from her bosom?\nDrive not thither too rashly: we might to our mortification\nHave to turn softly homewards our horses’ heads. For my fear is\nThat to some youth already this heart has been given; already\nThis brave hand has been clasped, has pledged faith to some fortunate lover.\nThen with my offer, alas! I should stand in confusion before her.”",
        "Straightway the pastor had opened his lips to speak consolation,\nWhen his companion broke in, and said in his voluble fashion:\n\"Years ago, forsooth, unknown had been such a dilemma.\nAll such affairs were then conducted in regular fashion.\nSoon as a bride for their son had been by the parents selected,\nFirst some family friend they into their councils would summon,\nWhom they afterwards sent as a suitor to visit the parents\nOf the elected bride. Arrayed in his finest apparel,\nSoon after dinner on Sunday he sought the respectable burgher,\nWhen some friendly words were exchanged upon general subjects,\nHe knowing how to direct the discourse as suited his purpose.\nAfter much circumlocution he finally mentioned the daughter,\nPraising her highly; and praising the man and the house that had sent him.\nPersons of tact perceived his intent, and the politic envoy\nReadily saw how their minds were disposed, and explained himself further.\nThen were the offer declined, e’en the ’no’ brought not mortification;\nBut did it meet with success, the suitor was ever thereafter\nMade the chief guest in the house on every festive occasion.\nFor, through the rest of their lives, the couple ne’er failed to remember\nThat ’twas by his experienced hand the first knot had been gathered.\nAll that, however, is changed, and, with many another good custom,\nQuite fallen out of the fashion; for every man woos for himself now.\nTherefore let every man hear to his face pronounced the refusal,\nIf a refusal there be, and stand shamed in the sight of the maiden!”",
        "“Let that be as it may!” made answer the youth, who had scarcely\nUnto the words paid heed; but in silence had made his decision.\n\"I will go thither myself, will myself hear my destiny spoken\nOut of the lips of a maiden in whom I a confidence cherish\nGreater than heart of man has e’er before cherished in woman.\nSay what she will, ’twill be good and wise; of that I am certain.\nShould I behold her never again, yet this once will I see her;\nYet this once the clear gaze of those dark eyes will encounter,\nIf I must press her ne’er to my heart, yet that neck and that bosom\nWill I behold once more, that my arm so longs to encircle;\nOnce more that mouth will see, whose kiss and whose ’yes’ would for ever\nRender me happy, from which a ’no’ will for ever destroy me.\nBut ye must leave me alone. Do not wait for me here; but return ye\nBack to my father and mother again, and give them the knowledge\nThat their son has not been deceived, that the maiden is worthy.\nSo then leave me alone! I shall follow the footpath that crosses\nOver the hill by the pear-tree, and thence descends through our vineyard,\nTaking a shorter way home. And oh, may I bring to our dwelling,\nJoyful and quick my beloved! but perhaps I alone may come creeping\nOver that path to the house, and ne’er again tread it with gladness.”",
        "Thus he spoke, and gave up the reins to the hand of the pastor,\nWho understandingly grasped them, the foaming horses controlling,\nSpeedily mounted the carriage, and sat in the seat of the driver.",
        "But thou didst hesitate, provident neighbor, and say in remonstrance:\n\"Heart and soul and spirit, my friend, I willingly trust thee;\nBut as for life and limb, they are not in the safest of keeping,\nWhen the temporal reins are usurped by the hand of the clergy.”",
        "But thou didst laugh at his words, intelligent pastor, and answer:\n\"Sit thee down, and contentedly trust me both body and spirit;\nFor, in holding the reins, my hand grew long ago skilful,\nLong has my eye been trained in making the nicest of turnings;\nFor we were practised well in driving the carriage in Strasburg,\nWhen I the youthful baron accompanied thither; then daily\nRolled the carriage, guided by me, through the echoing gateway,\nOut over dusty roads till we reached the meadows and lindens,\nSteering through groups of the town’s-folk beguiling the day there with walking.”",
        "Thereupon, half-reassured, the neighbor ascended the wagon,\nSat like one who for a prudent leap is holding him ready,\nAnd the stallions sped rapidly homeward, desiring their stable.\nClouds of dust whirled up from under their powerful hoofbeats.\nLong the youth stood there yet, and saw the dust in its rising,\nSaw the dust as it settled again: he stood there unheeding.",
        "Like as the traveller, who, when the sun is approaching its setting,\nFixes his eyes on it once again ere quickly it vanish,\nThen on the sides of the rocks, and on all the darkening bushes,\nSees its hovering image; whatever direction he look in\nThat hastes before, and flickers and gleams in radiant colors,—\nSo before Hermann’s eyes moved the beautiful shape of the maiden\nSoftly, and seeming to follow the path that led into the cornfield.\nBut he aroused from his wildering dream and turned himself slowly\nTowards where the village lay and was wildered again; for again came\nMoving to meet him the lofty form of the glorious maiden.\nFixedly gazed he upon her; herself it was and no phantom.\nBearing in either hand a larger jar and a smaller,\nEach by the handle, with busy step she came on to the fountain.\nJoyfully then he hastened to meet her; the sight of her gave him\nCourage and strength; and thus the astonished girl he accosted:\n\"Do I then find thee, brave-hearted maiden, so soon again busy,\nRendering aid unto others, and happy in bringing them comfort?\nSay why thou comest alone to this well which lies at such a distance,\nWhen all the rest are content with the water they find in the village?\nThis has peculiar virtues, ’tis true; and the taste is delicious.\nThou to that mother wouldst bring it, I trow, whom thy faithfulness rescued.”",
        "Straightway with cordial greeting the kindly maiden made answer:\n\"Here has my walk to the spring already been amply rewarded,\nSince I have found the good friend who bestowed so abundantly on us;\nFor a pleasure not less than the gifts is the sight of the giver.\nCome, I pray thee, and see for thyself who has tasted thy bounty;\nCome, and the quiet thanks receive of all it has solaced.\nBut that thou straightway the reason mayst know for which I am hither\nCome to draw, where pure and unfailing the water is flowing,\nThis I must tell thee,—that all the water we have in the village\nHas by improvident people been troubled with horses and oxen\nWading direct through the source which brings the inhabitants water.\nAnd furthermore they have also made foul with their washings and rinsings\nAll the troughs of the village, and all the fountains have sullied;\nFor but one thought is in all, and that how to satisfy quickest\nSelf and the need of the moment, regardless of what may come after.”",
        "Thus she spoke, and the broad stone steps meanwhile had descended\nWith her companion beside her, and on the low wall of the fountain\nBoth sat them down. She bent herself over to draw, and he also\nTook in his hand the jar that remained, and bent himself over,\nAnd in the blue of the heavens, they, seeing their image reflected,\nFriendly greetings and nods exchanged in the quivering mirror.",
        "“Give me to drink,” the youth thereupon in his gladness petitioned,\nAnd she handed the pitcher. Familiarly sat they and rested,\nBoth leaning over their jars, till she presently asked her companion:\n\"Tell me, why I find thee here, and without thy horses and wagon,\nFar from the place where I met thee at first? how camest thou hither?”",
        "Thoughtful he bent his eyes on the ground, then quietly raised them\nUp to her face, and, meeting with frankness the gaze of the maiden,\nFelt himself solaced and stilled. But then impossible was it,\nThat he of love should speak; her eye told not of affection,\nOnly of clear understanding, requiring intelligent answer.\nAnd he composed himself quickly, and cordially said to the maiden:\nHearken to me, my child, and let me reply to thy question.\n’Twas for thy sake that hither I came; why seek to conceal it?\nKnow I live happy at home with both my affectionate parents,\nFaithfully giving my aid their house and estates in directing,\nBeing an only son, and because our affairs are extensive.\nMine is the charge of the farm; my father bears rule in the household;\nWhile the presiding spirit of all is the diligent mother.\nBut thine experience doubtless has taught thee how grievously servants,\nNow through deceit, and now through their carelessness, harass the mistress,\nForcing her ever to change and replace one fault with another.\nLong for that reason my mother has wished for a maid in the household,\nWho not with hand alone, but with heart, too, will lend her assistance,\nTaking the daughter’s place, whom, alas! she was early deprived of.\nHow when to-day by the wagon I saw thee, so ready and cheerful,\nWitnessed the strength of thine arms, and thy limbs of such healthful proportion,\nWhen thy intelligent speech I heard, I was smitten with wonder.\nHastening homeward, I there to my parents and neighbors the stranger\nPraised as she well deserved. But I now am come hither to tell thee\nWhat is their wish as mine.—Forgive me my stammering language.”",
        "“Hesitate not,” she, answering, said, “to tell me what follows.\nThou dost not give me offence; I have listened with gratitude to thee:\nSpeak it out honestly therefore; the sound of it will not alarm me.\nThou wouldst engage me as servant to wait on thy father and mother,\nAnd to look after the welt-ordered house of which ye are the owners;\nAnd thou thinkest in me to find them a capable servant,\nOne who is skilled in her work, and not of a rude disposition.\nShort thy proposal has been, and short shall be also my answer.\nYes, I will go with thee home, and the call of fate I will follow.\nHere my duty is done: I have brought the newly made mother\nBack to her kindred again, who are all in her safety rejoicing.\nMost of our people already are gathered; the others will follow.\nAll think a few days more will certainly see them returning\nUnto their homes; for such is the exile’s constant delusion.\nBut by no easy hope do I suffer myself to be cheated\nDuring these sorrowful days which promise yet more days of sorrow.\nAll the bands of the world have been loosed, and what shall unite them,\nSaving alone the need, the need supreme, that is on us?\nIf in a good man’s house I can earn my living by service,\nUnder the eye of an excellent mistress, I gladly will do it;\nSince of doubtful repute, must be always a wandering maiden.\nYes, I will go with thee, soon as I first shall have carried the pitchers\nBack to my friends, and prayed the good people to give me their blessing.\nCome thou must see them thyself, and from their hands must receive me.”",
        "Joyfully hearkened the youth to the willing maiden’s decision,\nDoubtful whether he ought not at once to make honest confession.\nYet it appeared to him best to leave her awhile in her error,\nNor for her love to sue, before leading her home to his dwelling.\nAh! and the golden ring he perceived on the hand of the maiden,\nWherefore he let her speak on, and gave diligent ear to her language.",
        "“Come,” she presently said, “Let us back to the village; for maidens\nAlways are sure to be blamed if they tarry too long at the fountain.\nYet how delightful it is to chat by the murmuring water!”",
        "Then from their seats they rose, and both of them turned to the fountain\nOne more look behind, and a tender longing possessed them.\nBoth of the water-jars then in silence she took by the handle,\nCarried them up the steps, while behind her followed her lover.\nOne of the pitchers he begged her to give him to lighten the burden.\n\"Nay, let it be!” she said: “I carry them better so balanced.\nNor shall the master, who is to command, be doing me service.\nLook not so gravely upon me, as thinking my fortune a hard one.\nEarly a woman should learn to serve, for that is her calling;\nSince through service alone she finally comes to the headship,\nComes to the due command that is hers of right in the household.\nEarly the sister must wait on her brother, and wait on her parents;\nLife must be always with her a perpetual coming and going,\nOr be a fetching and carrying, making and doing for others.\nHappy for her be she wonted to think no way is too grievous,\nAnd if the hours of the night be to her as the hours of the daytime;\nIf she find never a needle too fine, nor a labor too trifling;\nWholly forgetful of self, and caring to live but in others!\nFor she will surely, as mother, have need of every virtue,\nWhen, in the time of her illness, the cries of her infant arouse her\nCalling for food from her weakness, and cares are to suffering added.\nTwenty men bound into one were not able to bear such a burden;\nNor is it meant that they should, yet should they with gratitude view it.”",
        "Thus she spoke, and was come, meanwhile, with her silent companion,\nFar as the floor of the barn, at the furthermost end of the garden,\nWhere was the sick woman lying, whom, glad, she had left with her daughters,\nThose late rescued maidens: fair pictures of innocence were they.\nBoth of them entered the barn; and, e’en as they did so, the justice,\nLeading a child in each hand, came in from the other direction.\nThese had been lost, hitherto, from the sight of their sorrowing mother;\nBut in the midst of the crowd the old man now had descried them.\nJoyfully sprang they forward to meet their dear mother’s embraces,\nAnd to salute with delight their brother, their unknown companion.\nNext upon Dorothea they sprang with affectionate greeting,\nAsking for bread and fruit, but more than all else for some water.\nSo then she handed the water about; and not only the children\nDrank, but the sick woman too, and her daughters, and with them the justice.\nAll were refreshed, and highly commended the glorious water;\nAcid it was to the taste, and reviving, and wholesome to drink of.",
        "Then with a serious face the maiden replied to them, saying:\n\"Friends, for the last time now to your mouth have I lifted my pitcher;\nAnd for the last time by me have your lips been moistened with water.\nBut henceforth in the heat of the clay when the draught shall refresh you,\nWhen in the shade ye enjoy your rest beside a clear fountain,\nThink of me then sometimes and of all my affectionate service,\nPrompted more by my love than the duty I owed you as kindred.\nI shall acknowledge as long as I live the kindness ye’ve shown me.\n’Tis with regret that I leave you; but every one now is a burden,\nMore than a help to his neighbor, and all must be finally scattered\nFar through a foreign land, if return to our homes be denied us.\nSee, here stands the youth to whom we owe thanks for the presents.\nHe gave the cloak for the baby, and all these welcome provisions.\nNow he is come, and has asked me if I will make one in his dwelling,\nThat I may serve therein his wealthy and excellent parents.\nAnd I refuse not the offer; for maidens must always be serving;\nBurdensome were it for them to rest and be served in the household.\nTherefore I follow him gladly. A youth of intelligence seems he,\nAnd so will also the parents be, as becometh the wealthy.\nSo then farewell, dear friend; and mayst thou rejoice in thy nursling,\nLiving, and into thy face already so healthfully looking!\nWhen thou shalt press him against thy breast in these gay-colored wrappings,\nOh, then remember the kindly youth who bestowed them upon us,\nAnd who me also henceforth, thy sister, will shelter and nourish.\nThou, too, excellent man!” she said as she turned to the justice;\n\"Take my thanks that in many a need I have found thee a father.\"\nThen she knelt down on the floor by the side of the newly made mother,\nKissing the weeping woman, and taking her low-whispered blessing.\nThou, meanwhile, worshipful justice, wast speaking to Hermann and saying:\n\"Justly mayst thou, my friend, be counted among the good masters,\nCareful to manage their household affairs with capable servants.\nFor I have often observed how in sheep, as in horses and oxen,\nMen conclude never a bargain without making closest inspection,\nWhile with a servant who all things preserves, if honest and able,\nAnd who will every thing lose and destroy, if he set to work falsely,\nHim will a chance or an accident make us admit to our dwelling,\nAnd we are left, when too late, to repent an o’er hasty decision.\nThou understandest the matter it seems; because thou hast chosen,\nThee and thy parents to serve in the house, a maid who is honest.\nHold her with care; for as long as thy household is under her keeping,\nThou shalt not want for a sister, nor yet for a daughter thy parents.”",
        "Many were come, meanwhile, near relatives all of the mother,\nBringing her various gifts, and more suitable quarters announcing.\nAll of them, hearing the maiden’s decision, gave Hermann their blessing,\nCoupled with glances of meaning, while each made his special reflections.\nHastily one and another would say in the ear of his neighbor:\n\"If in the master a lover she find, right well were she cared for.\"\nHermann took her at last by the hand, and said as he did so:\n\"Let us be going; the day is declining, and distant the city.\"\nEager and voluble then the women embraced Dorothea;\nHermann drew her away; but other adieus must be spoken:\nLastly the children with cries fell upon her and terrible weeping,\nClung to her garments, and would not their dear second mother should leave them.\nBut in a tone of command the women said, one and another:\n\"Hush now, children, she’s going to the town, and will presently bring you\nPlenty of nice sweet cake that was by your brother bespoken\nWhen by the stork just now he was brought past the shop of the baker.\nSoon you will see her come back with sugar-plums splendidly gilded.\"\nThen did the little ones loose their hold, and Hermann, though hardly,\nTore her from further embraces away, and far-waving kerchiefs.",
        "Towards the setting sun the two thus went on their journey:\nClose he had wrapped himself round with clouds portending a tempest.\nOut from the veil, now here and now there, with fiery flashes,\nGleaming over the field shot forth the ominous lightning.\n\"May not these threatening heavens,” said Hermann, “be presently sending\nHailstones upon us and violent rains; for fair is the harvest.\"\nAnd in the waving luxuriant grain they delighted together:\nAlmost as high it reached as the lofty shapes that moved through it.",
        "Thereupon spoke the maiden, and said to her guide and companion:\n\"Friend, unto whom I soon am to owe so kindly a fortune,\nShelter and home, while many an exile’s exposed to the tempest,\nTell me concerning thy parents, I pray thee, and teach me to know them,\nThem whom with all my heart I desire to serve in the future.\nWho understands his master, more easily gives satisfaction,\nHaving regard to the things which to him seem chief in importance,\nAnd on the doing of which his firm-set mind is determined.\nTell me therefore, I pray, how to win thy father and mother.”",
        "And to her question made answer the good and intelligent Hermann:\n\"Ah, what wisdom thou showest, thou good, thou excellent maiden,\nAsking thus first of all concerning the tastes of my parents!\nKnow that in vain hitherto I have labored in serving my father,\nTaking upon me as were it my own, the charge of the household;\nEarly and late at work in the fields, and o’erseeing the vineyard.\nBut my mother I fully content, who can value my service;\nAnd thou wilt also appear in her eyes the worthiest of maidens,\nIf for the house thou carest, as were it thine own thou wast keeping.\nOtherwise is it with father, who cares for the outward appearance.\nDo not regard me, good maiden, as one who is cold and unfeeling,\nThat unto thee a stranger I straightway discover my father.\nNay, I assure thee that never before have words such as these are\nFreely dropped from my tongue, which is not accustomed to prattle;\nBut from out of my bosom thou lurest its every secret.\nSome of the graces of life my good father covets about him,\nOutward signs of affection he wishes, as well as of honor;\nAnd an inferior servant might possibly give satisfaction,\nWho could turn these to account, while he might be displeased with a better.”",
        "Thereupon said she with joy, the while her hastening footsteps\nOver the darkening pathway with easy motion she quickened:\n\"Truly I hope to them both I shall equally give satisfaction:\nFor in thy mother’s nature I find such an one as mine own is,\nAnd to the outward graces I’ve been from my childhood accustomed.\nGreatly was courtesy valued among our neighbors the Frenchmen,\nDuring their earlier days; it was common to noble and burgher,\nAs to the peasant, and every one made it the rule of his household.\nSo, on the side of us Germans, the children were likewise accustomed\nDaily to bring to their parents, with kissing of hands and with curtseys,\nMorning good-wishes, and all through the day to be prettily mannered.\nEvery thing thus that I learned, and to which I’ve been used from my childhood,\nAll that my heart shall suggest, shall be brought into play for thy father.\nBut who shall tell me of thee, and how thyself shouldst be treated,\nThou the only son of the house, and henceforth my master?”",
        "Thus she said, and e’en as she spoke they stood under the pear-tree.\nDown from the heavens the moon at her full was shedding her splendor.\nNight had come on, and wholly obscured was the last gleam of sunlight,\nSo that contrasting masses lay side by side with each other,\nClear and bright as the day, and black with the shadows of midnight;\nGratefully fell upon Hermann’s ear the kindly asked question\nUnder the shade of the glorious tree, the spot he so treasured,\nWhich but this morning had witnessed the tears he had shed for the exile.\nAnd while they sat themselves down to rest them here for a little,\nThus spoke the amorous youth, as he grasped the hand of the maiden:\n\"Suffer thy heart to make answer, and follow it freely in all things.\"\nYet naught further he ventured to say although so propitious\nSeemed the hour: he feared he should only haste on a refusal.\nAh, and he felt besides the ring on her finger, sad token!\nTherefore they sat there, silent and still, beside one another.",
        "First was the maiden to speak: “How sweet is this glorious moonlight!\"\nSaid she at length: “It is as the light of the day in its brightness.\nThere in the city I plainly can see the houses and courtyards,\nAnd in the gable—methinks I can number its panes-is a window.”",
        "“What thou seest,” the modest youth thereupon made her answer,—\n\"What thou seest is our dwelling, to which I am leading thee downward,\nAnd that window yonder belongs to my room in the attic,\nWhich will be thine perhaps, for various changes are making.\nAll these fields, too, are ours; they are ripe for the harvest to-morrow.\nHere in the shade we will rest, and partake of our noontide refreshment.\nBut it is time we began our descent through the vineyard and garden;\nFor dost thou mark how yon threatening storm-cloud comes nearer and nearer,\nCharged with lightning, and ready our fair full moon to extinguish?”",
        "So they arose from their seats, and over the cornfields descended,\nThrough the luxuriant grain, enjoying the brightness of evening,\nUntil they came to the vineyard, and so entered into its shadow.\nThen he guided her down o’er the numerous blocks that were lying,\nRough and unhewn on the pathway, and served as the steps of the alley.\nSlowly the maiden descended, and leaning her hands on his shoulder,\nWhile with uncertain beams, the moon through the leaves overlooked them,\nEre she was veiled by the cloud, and so left the couple in darkness.\nCarefully Hermann’s strength supported the maid that hung o’er him;\nBut, not knowing the path and the rough-hewn steps that led down it,\nMissed she her footing, her ankle turned, and she surely had fallen,\nHad not the dexterous youth his arm outstretched in an instant,\nAnd his beloved upheld. She gently sank on his shoulder;\nBreast was pressed against breast, and cheek against cheek. Thus he stood there\nFixed as a marble statue, the force of will keeping him steadfast,\nDrew her not to him more closely, but braced himself under her pressure.\nThus he the glorious burden felt, the warmth of her bosom,\nAnd the perfume of her breath, that over his lips was exhaling;\nBore with the heart of a man the majestic form of the woman.",
        "But she with playfulness said, concealing the pain that she suffered:\n\"That is a sign of misfortune, so timorous persons would tell us,\nWhen on approaching a house we stumble not far from the threshold;\nAnd for myself, I confess, I could wish for a happier omen.\nLet us here linger awhile that thy parents may not have to blame thee,\nSeeing a limping maid, and thou seem an incompetent landlord.”",
        "Muses, O ye who the course of true love so willingly favor,\nYe who thus far on his way the excellent youth have conducted,\nEven before the betrothal have pressed to his bosom the maiden;\nFurther your aid vouchsafe this charming pair in uniting,\nStraightway dispersing the clouds which over their happiness lower!\nYet first of all declare what is passing meanwhile at the Lion.",
        "Now for the third time again the mother impatient had entered\nWhere were assembled the men, whom anxious but now she had quitted;\nSpoke of the gathering storm, and the moonlight’s rapid obscuring;\nThen of her son’s late tarrying abroad and the dangers of nightfall;\nSharply upbraided her friends that without having speech of the maiden,\nAnd without urging his suit, they had parted from Hermann so early.",
        "“Make it not worse than it is,” the father replied with displeasure.\n\"For, as thou seest, we tarry ourselves and are waiting the issue.”",
        "Calmly, however, from where he was sitting the neighbor made answer:\n\"Never in hours of disquiet like this do I fail to be grateful\nUnto my late, blessed father, who every root of impatience\nTore from my heart when a child, and left no fibre remaining;\nSo that I learned on the instant to wait as do none of your sages.”",
        "“Tell us,” the pastor returned, “what legerdemain he made use of.\"\n\"That will I gladly relate, for all may draw from it a lesson;\"\nSo made the neighbor reply. “When a boy I once stood of a Sunday\nFull of impatience, and looking with eagerness out for the carriage\nWhich was to carry us forth to the spring that lies under the lindens.\nStill the coach came not. I ran, like a weasel, now hither, now thither,\nUp stairs and down, and forward and back, ’twixt the door and the window;\nEven my fingers itched to be moving; I scratched on the tables,\nWent about pounding and stamping, and hardly could keep me from weeping.\nAll was observed by the calm-tempered man; but at last when my folly\nCame to be carried too far, by the arm he quietly took me,\nLed me away to the window, and spoke in this serious language:\n’Seest thou yonder the carpenter’s shop that is closed for the Sunday?\nHe will re-open to-morrow, when plane and saw will be started,\nAnd will keep on through the hours of labor from morning till evening.\nBut consider you this,—a day will be presently coming\nWhen that man shall himself be astir and all of his workmens\nMaking a coffin for thee to be quickly and skilfully finished.\nThen that house of boards they will busily bring over hither,\nWhich must at last receive alike the impatient and patient,\nAnd which is destined soon with close-pressing roof to be covered.’\nStraightway I saw the whole thing in my mind as if it were doing;\nSaw the boards fitting together, and saw the black color preparing,\nSat me down patiently then, and in quiet awaited the carriage.\nNow when others I see, in seasons of anxious expectance,\nRunning distracted about, I cannot but think of the coffin.”",
        "Smiling, the pastor replied: “The affecting picture of death stands\nNot as a dread to the wise, and not as an end to the pious.\nThose it presses again into life, and teaches to use it;\nThese by affliction it strengthens in hope to future salvation.\nDeath becomes life unto both. Thy father was greatly mistaken\nWhen to a sensitive boy he death in death thus depicted.\nLet us the value of nobly ripe age, point out to the young man,\nAnd to the aged the youth, that in the eternal progression\nBoth may rejoice, and life may in life thus find its completion.’’",
        "But the door was now opened, and showed the majestical couple.\nFilled with amaze were the friends, and amazed the affectionate parents,\nSeeing the form of the maid so well matched with that of her lover.\nYea, the door seemed too low to allow the tall figures to enter,\nAs they together now appeared coming over the threshold.",
        "Hermann, with hurried words, presented her thus to his parents:\n\"Here is a maiden,” he said; “such a one as ye wish in the household.\nKindly receive her, dear father: she merits it well; and thou, mother,\nQuestion her straightway on all that belongs to a housekeeper’s duty,\nThat ye may see how well she deserves to ye both to be nearer.”",
        "Quickly he then drew aside the excellent clergyman, saying:\n\"Help me, O worthy sir, and speedily out of this trouble;\nLoosen, I pray thee, this knot, at whose untying I tremble.\nKnow that ’tis not as a lover that I have brought hither the maiden;\nBut she believes that as servant she comes to the house, and I tremble\nLest in displeasure she fly as soon as there’s mention of marriage.\nBut be it straightway decided; for she no longer in error\nThus shall be left, and I this suspense no longer can suffer.\nHasten and show us in this a proof of the wisdom we honor.”",
        "Towards the company then the clergyman instantly turned him;\nBut already, alas! had the soul of the maiden been troubled,\nHearing the father’s speech; for he, in his sociable fashion,\nHad in these playful words, with the kindest intention addressed her:\n\"Ay, this is well, my child! with delight I perceive that my Hermann\nHas the good taste of his father, who often showed his in his young days,\nLeading out always the fairest to dance, and bringing the fairest\nFinally home as his wife; our dear little mother here that was.\nFor by the bride that a man shall elect we can judge what himself is,\nTell what the spirit is in him, and whether he feel his own value.\nNor didst thou need for thyself, I’ll engage, much time for decision;\nFor, in good sooth, methinks, he’s no difficult person to follow.”",
        "Hermann had heard but in part; his limbs were inwardly trembling,\nAnd of a sudden a stillness had fallen on all of the circle.",
        "But by these words of derision, for such she could not but deem them,\nWounded, and stung to the depths of her soul, the excellent maiden,\nStood, while the fugitive blood o’er her cheeks and e’en to her bosom,\nPoured its flush. But she governed herself, and her courage collecting,\nAnswered the old man thus, her pain not wholly concealing:\n\"Truly for such a reception thy son had in no wise prepared me,\nWhen he the ways of his father described, the excellent burgher.\nThou art a man of culture, I know, before whom I am standing;\nDealest with every one wisely, according as suits his position;\nBut thou hast scanty compassion, it seems, on one such as I am,\nWho, a poor girl, am now crossing thy threshold with purpose to serve thee;\nElse, with such bitter derision, thou wouldst not have made me remember\nHow far removed my fortune from that of thyself and thy son is.\nTrue, I come poor to thy house, and bring with me naught but my bundle\nHere where is every abundance to gladden the prosperous inmates.\nYet I know well myself; I feel the relations between us,\nSay, is it noble, with so much of mockery straightway to greet me,\nThat I am sent from the house while my foot is scarce yet on the threshold?”",
        "Anxiously Hermann turned and signed to his ally the pastor\nThat he should rush to the rescue and straightway dispel the delusion.\nThen stepped the wise man hastily forward and looked on the maiden’s\nTearful eyes, her silent pain and repressed indignation,\nAnd in his heart was impelled not at once to clear up the confusion,\nRather to put to the test the girl’s disquieted spirit.\nTherefore he unto her said in language intended to try her:\n\"Surely, thou foreign-born maiden, thou didst not maturely consider,\nWhen thou too rashly decidedst to enter the service of strangers,\nAll that is meant by the placing thyself ’neath the rule of a master;\nFor by our hand to a bargain the fate of the year is determined,\nAnd but a single ’yea’ compels to much patient endurance.\nNot the worst part of the service the wearisome steps to be taken,\nNeither the bitter sweat of a labor that presses unceasing;\nSince the industrious freeman must toil as well as the servant.\nBut ’tis to bear with the master’s caprice when he censures unjustly,\nOr when, at variance with self, he orders now this, now the other;\nBear with the petulance, too, of the mistress, easily angered,\nAnd with the rude, overbearing ways of unmannerly children.\nAll this is hard to endure, and yet to go on with thy duties\nQuickly, without delay, nor thyself grow sullen and stubborn.\nYet thou appearest ill fitted for this, since already so deeply\nStung by the father’s jests: whereas there is nothing more common\nThan for a girl to be teased on account of a youth she may fancy.”",
        "Thus he spoke. The maiden had felt the full force of his language,\nAnd she restrained her no more; but with passionate outburst her feelings\nMade themselves way; a sob broke forth from her now heaving bosom,\nAnd, while the scalding tears poured down, she straightway made answer:\n\"Ah, that rational man who thinks to advise us in sorrow,\nKnows not how little of power his cold words have in relieving\nEver a heart from that woe which a sovereign fate has inflicted.\nYe are prosperous and glad; how then should a pleasantry wound you?\nYet but the lightest touch is a source of pain to the sick man.\nNay, concealment itself, if successful, had profited nothing.\nBetter show now what had later increased to a bitterer anguish,\nAnd to an inward consuming despair might perhaps have reduced me.\nLet me go back! for here in this house I can tarry no longer.\nI will away, and wander in search of my hapless companions,\nWhom I forsook in their need; for myself alone choosing the better.\nThis is my firm resolve, and I therefore may make a confession\nWhich might for years perhaps have else lain hid in my bosom.\nDeeply indeed was I hurt by the father’s words of derision;\nNot that I’m sensitive, proud beyond what is fitting a servant;\nBut that my heart in truth had felt itself stirred with affection\nTowards the youth who to-day had appeared to my eyes as a savior.\nWhen he first left me there on the road, he still remained present,\nHaunting my every thought; I fancied the fortunate maiden\nWhom as a bride, perhaps, his heart had already elected.\nWhen at the fountain I met him again, the sight of him wakened\nPleasure as great as if there had met me an angel from heaven;\nAnd with what gladness I followed, when asked to come as his servant.\nTrue, that I flattered myself in my heart,—I will not deny it,—\nWhile we were hitherward coming, I might peradventure deserve him,\nShould I become at last the important stay of the household.\nNow I, alas! for the first time see what risk I was running,\nWhen I would make my home so near to the secretly loved one;\nNow for the first time feel how far removed a poor maiden\nIs from an opulent youth, no matter how great her deserving.\nAll this I now confess, that my heart ye may not misinterpret,\nIn that ’twas hurt by a chance to which I owe my awaking.\nHiding my secret desires, this dread had been ever before me,\nThat at some early day he would bring him a bride to his dwelling;\nAnd ah, how could I then my inward anguish have suffered!\nHappily I have been warned, and happily now has my bosom\nBeen of its secret relieved, while yet there is cure for the evil.\nBut no more; I have spoken; and now shall nothing detain me\nLonger here in a house where I stay but in shame and confusion,\nFreely confessing my love and that foolish hope that I cherished.\nNot the night which abroad is covered with lowering storm clouds;\nNot the roll of the thunder—I hear its peal—shall deter me;\nNot the pelt of the rain which without is beating in fury;\nNeither the blustering tempest; for all these things have I suffered\nDuring our sorrowful flight, and while the near foe was pursuing.\nNow I again go forth, as I have so long been accustomed,\nCarried away by the whirl of the times, and from every thing parted.\nFare ye well! I tarry no longer; all now is over.”",
        "Thus she spoke and back to the door she hastily turned her,\nStill bearing under her arm, as she with her had brought it, her bundle.\nBut with both of her arms the mother seized hold of the maiden,\nClasping her round the waist, and exclaiming, amazed and bewildered:\n\"Tell me, what means all this? and these idle tears, say, what mean they?\nI will not let thee depart: thou art the betrothed of my Hermann.”",
        "But still the father stood, observing the scene with displeasure,\nLooked on the weeping girl, and said in a tone of vexation:\n\"This then must be the return that I get for all my indulgence,\nThat at the close of the day this most irksome of all things should happen!\nFor there is naught I can tolerate less than womanish weeping,\nViolent outcries, which only involve in disorder and passion,\nWhat with a little of sense had been more smoothly adjusted.\nSettle the thing for yourselves: I’m going to bed; I’ve no patience\nLonger to be a spectator of these your marvellous doings.\"\nQuickly he turned as he spoke, and hastened to go to the chamber\nWhere he was wonted to rest, and his marriage bed was kept standing,\nBut he was held by his son, who said in a tone of entreaty:\n\"Father, hasten not from us, and be thou not wroth with the maiden.\nI, only I, am to blame as the cause of all this confusion,\nWhich by his dissimulation our friend unexpectedly heightened.\nSpeak, O worthy sir; for to thee my cause I intrusted.\nHeap not up sorrow and anger, but rather let all this be ended;\nFor I could hold thee never again in such high estimation,\nIf thou shouldst show but delight in pain, not superior wisdom.”",
        "Thereupon answered and said the excellent clergyman, smiling:\n\"Tell me, what other device could have drawn this charming confession\nOut of the good maiden’s lips, and thus have revealed her affection?\nHas not thy trouble been straightway transformed into gladness and rapture?\nTherefore speak up for thyself; what need of the tongue of another?”",
        "Thereupon Hermann came forward, and spoke in these words of affection:\n\"Do not repent of thy tears, nor repent of these passing distresses;\nFor they complete my joy, and—may I not hope it-thine also?\nNot to engage tho stranger, the excellent maid, as a servant,\nUnto the fountain I came; but to sue for thy love I came thither.\nOnly, alas! my timorous look could thy heart’s inclination\nNowise perceive; I read in thine eyes of nothing but kindness,\nAs from the fountain’s tranquil mirror thou gavest me greeting.\nMight I but bring thee home, the half of my joy was accomplished.\nBut thou completest it unto me now; oh, blest be thou for it!\"\nThen with a deep emotion the maiden gazed on the stripling;\nNeither forbade she embrace and kiss, the summit of rapture,\nWhen to a loving pair they come as the longed-for assurance,\nPledge of a lifetime of bliss, that appears to them now never-ending.",
        "Unto the others, meanwhile, the pastor had made explanation.\nBut with feeling and grace the maid now advanced to the father,\nBent her before him, and kissing the hand he would fain have withholden,\nSaid: “Thou wilt surely be just and forgive one so startled as I was,\nFirst for my tears of distress, and now for the tears of my gladness.\nThat emotion forgive me, and oh! forgive me this also.\nFor I can scarce comprehend the happiness newly vouchsafed me.\nYes, let that first vexation of which I, bewildered, was guilty\nBe too the last. Whatever the maid of affectionate service\nFaithfully promised, shall be to thee now performed by the daughter.\"\nStraightway then, concealing his tears, the father embraced her,\nCordially, too, the mother came forward and kissed her with fervor,\nPressing her hands in her own: the weeping women were silent.",
        "Thereupon quickly he seized, the good and intelligent pastor,\nFirst the father’s hand, and the wedding-ring drew from his finger,—\nNot so easily either: the finger was plump and detained it,—\nNext took the mother’s ring also, and with them betrothed he the children,\nSaying: “These golden circlets once more their office performing\nFirmly a tie shall unite, which in all things shall equal the old one,\nDeeply is this young man imbued with love of the maiden,\nAnd, as the maiden confesses, her heart is gone out to him also.\nHere do I therefore betroth you and bless for the years that are coming,\nWith the consent of the parents, and having this friend as a witness.”",
        "Then the neighbor saluted at once, and expressed his good wishes;\nBut when the clergyman now the golden circlet was drawing\nOver the maiden’s hand, he observed with amazement the other,\nWhich had already by Hermann been anxiously marked at the fountain.\nAnd with a kindly raillery thus thereupon he addressed her:\n\"So, then thy second betrothal is this? let us hope the first bridegroom\nMay not appear at the altar, and so prohibit the marriage.”",
        "But she, answering, said: “Oh, let me to this recollection\nYet one moment devote; for so much is due the good giver,\nHim who bestowed it at parting, and never came back to his kindred.\nAll that should come he foresaw, when in haste the passion for freedom,\nWhen a desire in the newly changed order of things to be working,\nUrged him onward to Paris, where chains and death he encountered.\n’Fare thee well,’ were his words; ’I go, for all is in motion\nNow for a time on the earth, and every thing seems to be parting.\nE’en in the firmest states fundamental laws are dissolving;\nProperty falls away from the hand of the ancient possessor;\nFriend is parted from friend; and so parts lover from lover.\nHere I leave thee, and where I shall find thee again, or if ever,\nWho can tell? Perhaps these words are our last ones together.\nMan’s but a stranger here on the earth, we are told and with reason;\nAnd we are each of us now become more of strangers than ever.\nOurs no more is the soil, and our treasures are all of them changing:\nSilver and gold are melting away from their time-honored patterns.\nAll is in motion as though the already-shaped world into chaos\nMeant to resolve itself backward into night, and to shape itself over.\nMine thou wilt keep thine heart, and should we be ever united\nOver the ruins of earth, it will be as newly made creatures,\nBeings transformed and free, no longer dependent on fortune;\nFor can aught fetter the man who has lived through days such as these are!\nBut if it is not to be, that, these dangers happily over,\nEver again we be granted the bliss of mutual embraces,\nOh, then before thy thoughts so keep my hovering image\nThat with unshaken mind thou be ready for good or for evil!\nShould new ties allure thee again, and a new habitation,\nEnter with gratitude into the joys that fate shall prepare thee;\nLove those purely who love thee; be grateful to them who show kindness.\nBut thine uncertain foot should yet be planted but lightly,\nFor there is lurking the twofold pain of a new separation.\nBlessings attend thy life; but value existence no higher\nThan thine other possessions, and all possessions are cheating!’\nThus spoke the noble youth, and never again I beheld him.\nMeanwhile I lost my all, and a thousand times thought of his warning.\nHere, too, I think of his words, when love is sweetly preparing\nHappiness for me anew, and glorious hopes are reviving,\nOh forgive me, excellent friend, that e’en while I hold thee\nClose to my side I tremble! So unto the late-landed sailor\nSeem the most solid foundations of firmest earth to be rocking.’",
        "Thus she spoke, and placed the two rings on her finger together.\nBut her lover replied with a noble and manly emotion:\n\"So much the firmer then, amid these universal convulsions,\nBe, Dorothea, our union! We two will hold fast and continue,\nFirmly maintaining ourselves, and the right to our ample possessions.\nFor that man, who, when times are uncertain, is faltering in spirit,\nOnly increases the evil, and further and further transmits it;\nWhile he refashions the world, who keeps himself steadfastly minded.\nPoorly becomes it the German to give to these fearful excitements\nAught of continuance, or to be this way and that way inclining.\nThis is our own! let that be our word, and let us maintain it!\nFor to those resolute peoples respect will be ever accorded,\nWho for God and the laws, for parents, women and children,\nFought and died, as together they stood with their front to the foeman.\nThou art mine own; and now what is mine, is mine more than ever.\nNot with anxiety will I preserve it, and trembling enjoyment;\nRather with courage and strength. To-day should the enemy threaten,\nOr in the future, equip me thyself and hand me my weapons.\nLet me but know that under thy care are my house and dear parents,\nOh! I can then with assurance expose my breast to the foeman.\nAnd were but every man minded like me, there would be an upspring\nMight against might, and peace should revisit us all with its gladness.”",
