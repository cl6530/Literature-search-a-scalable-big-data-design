        "In the chapter on the germ idea we saw that the theme or subject\nof a playlet is a problem that must be solved with complete\nsatisfaction.  In this chapter we shall see how the problem–which\nis the first creeping form of a plot–is developed and expanded\nby the application of formal elements and made to grow into a plot.\nAt the same time we shall see how the dramatic element of\nplot–discussed in the preceding chapter–is given form and direction\nin logical expression.",
        "You will recall that our consideration of the germ idea led us\nfarther afield than a mere consideration of a theme or subject,\nor even of the problem–as we agreed to call the spark that makes\nthe playlet go.  In showing how a playlet writer gets an idea and\nhow his mind works in developing it, we took the problem of “The\nSystem” and developed it into a near-plot form.  It may have seemed\nto you at the time that the problem we assumed for the purpose of\nexposition was worked out very carefully into a plot, but if you\nwill turn back to it now, you will realize how incomplete the\nelaboration was–it was no more complete than any germ idea should\nbe before you even consider spending time to build it into a\nplaylet.",
        "Let us now determine definitely what a playlet plot is, consider\nits structural elements and then take one of the fine examples of\na playlet in the Appendix and see how its plot is constructed.",
        "The plot of a playlet is its story.  It is the general outline,\nthe plan, the skeleton which is covered by the flesh of the\ncharacters and clothed by their words.  If the theme or problem\nis the heart that beats with life, then the scenery amid which the\nanimated body moves is its habitation, and the dramatic spirit is\nthe soul that reveals meaning in the whole.",
        "To hazard a definition:",
        "A playlet plot is a sequence of events logically developed out\n  of a theme or problem, into a crisis or entanglement due to a\n  conflict of the characters’ wills, and then logically untangled\n  again, leaving the characters in a different relation to each\n  other–changed in themselves by the crisis.",
        "Note that a mere series of incidents does not make a plot–the\npresence of crisis is absolutely necessary to plot.  If the series\nof events does not develop a complication that changes the characters\nin themselves and in their relations to each other, there can be\nno plot.  If this is so, let us now take the sequence of events\nthat compose the story of “The Lollard” [1] and see what constitutes\nthem a plot.  I shall not restate its story, only repeat it in the\nexamination of its various points [2].",
        "[1] Edgar Allan Woolf’s fine satirical comedy to be found in the\nAppendix.",
        "[2] As a side light, you see how a playlet theme differs from a\nplaylet plot.  You will recall that in the chapter on “The Germ\nIdea,” the theme of The Lollard was thus stated in terms of a\nplaylet problem:  “A foolish young woman may leave her husband\nbecause she has ’found him out,’ yet return to him when she discovers\nthat another man is no better than he is.”  Compare this brief\nstatement with the full statement of the plot given hereafter.",
        "The coming of Angela Maxwell to Miss Carey’s door at 2 A.M.–unusual\nas is the hour–is just an event; the fact that Angela has left\nher husband, Harry, basic as it is, is but little more than an\nevent; the entrance of the lodger, Fred Saltus, is but another\nevent, and even Harry Maxwell’s coming in search of his wife is\nmerely an event–for if Harry had sat down and argued Angela out\nof her pique, even though Fred were present, there would have been\nno complication, save for the cornerstone motive of her having\nleft him.  If this sequence of events forms merely a mildly\ninteresting narrative, what, then, is the complication that weaves\nthem into a plot?",
        "The answer is, in Angela’s falling in love with Fred’s broad\nshoulders, wealth of hair and general good looks–this complication\ndevelops the crisis out of Harry’s wanting Angela.  If Harry hadn’t\ncared, there would have been no drama–the drama comes from Harry’s\nwanting Angela when Angela wants Fred; Angela wants something that\nruns counter to Harry’s will–there is the clash of wills out\nof which flashes the dramatic.",
        "But still there would be no plot–and consequently no playlet–if\nHarry had acknowledged himself beaten after his first futile\ninterview with Angela.  The entanglement is there–Harry has to\nuntangle it.  He has to win Angela again–and how he does it, on\nMiss Carey’s tip, you may know from reading the playlet.  But, if\nyou have read it, did you realize the dramatic force of the unmasking\nof Fred–accomplished without (explanatory) words, merely by making\nFred run out on the stage and dash back into his room again? There\nis a fine example of the revealing flash!  This incident–made big\nby the dramatic–is the ironical solvent that loosens the warp of\nAngela’s will and prepares her for complete surrender.  Harry’s\nentrance in full regimentals–what woman does not love a uniform?–\nis merely the full rounding out of the plot that ends with Harry’s\ncarrying his little wife home to happiness again.",
        "But, let us pursue this examination further, in the light of the\npreceding chapter.  There would have been no drama if the meaning\nof these incidents had not–because Angela is a “character” and\nHarry one, too–been inherent in them.  There would have been no\nplot, nothing of dramatic spirit, if Harry had not been made by\nthose events to realize his mistake and Angela had not been made\nto see that Harry was “no worse” than another man.  It is the\nchange in Harry and the change in Angela that changes their\nrelations to each other–therein lies the essence of the plot. [1]",
        "[1] Unfortunately, the bigger, broader meaning we all read into\nthis satire of life, cannot enter into our consideration of the\nstructure of plot.  It lies too deep in the texture of the\nplaywright’s mind and genius to admit of its being plucked out by\nthe roots for critical examination.  The bigger meaning is there–we\nall see it, and recognize that it stamps The Lollard as good drama.\nEach playwright must work out his own meanings of life for himself\nand weave them magically into his own playlets; this is something\nthat cannot be added to a man, that cannot be satisfactorily\nexplained when seen, and cannot be taken away from him.",
        "Now, having determined what a plot is, let us take up its structural\nparts and see how these clearly understood principles make the\nconstruction of a playlet plot in a measure a matter of clear\nthinking.",
        "We must swerve for a moment and cut across lots, that we may touch\nevery one of the big structural elements of plot and relate them\nwith logical closeness to the playlet, summing them all up in the\nend and tying them closely into–what I hope may be–a helpful\ndefinition, on the last page of this chapter.",
        "The first of the structural parts that we must consider before we\ntake up the broader dramatic unities, is the seemingly obvious one\nthat a plot has a beginning, a middle and an ending.",
        "There has been no clearer statement of this element inherent in\nall plots, than that made by Aristotle in his famous twenty-century\nold dissection of tragedy; he says:",
        "“Tragedy is an imitation of an action, that is complete and whole,\nand of a certain magnitude (not trivial). . . .  A whole is that\nwhich has a beginning, middle and end.  A beginning is that which\ndoes not itself follow anything by causal necessity, but after\nwhich something naturally is or comes to be.  An end, on the\ncontrary, is that which itself naturally follows some other thing,\neither by necessity or in the regular course of events, but has\nnothing to follow it.  A middle is that which naturally follows\nsomething as some other thing follows it.  A well-constructed plot,\ntherefore, must neither begin nor end at haphazard, but conform\nto the type here described.” [1]",
        "[1] Aristotle, Poetics VII.",
        "Let us state the first part of the doctrine in this way:",
        "Although life knows neither a beginning nor an end–not your life\nnor mine, but the stream of unseparate events that make up\nexistence–a work of art, like the playlet, must have both.  The\nbeginning of any event in real life may lie far back in history;\nits immediate beginnings, however, start out closely together and\ndistinctly in related causes and become more indistinctly related\nthe farther back they go.  Just where you should consider the event\nthat is the crisis of your playlet has its beginning, depends upon\nhow you want to tell it–in other words, it depends upon you.  No\none can think for you, but there are one or two observations upon\nthe nature of plot-beginnings that may be suggestive.",
        "In the first place, no matter how carefully the dramatic material\nhas been severed from connection with other events, it cannot be\nconsidered entirely independent.  By the very nature of things,\nit must have its roots in the past from which it springs, and these\nroots–the foundations upon which the playlet rises–must be\npresented to the audience at the very beginning.",
        "If you were introducing a friend of yours and his sister and brother\nto your family, who had never met them before, you would tell which\none was your particular friend, what his sister’s name was, and\nhis brother’s name, too, and their relationship to your friend.\nAnd, if the visit were unexpected, you would–naturally and\nunconsciously–determine how they happened to come and how long\nyou might have the pleasure of entertaining them; in fact, you\nwould fix every fact that would give your family a clear understanding\nof the event of their presence.  In other words, you would very\ninformally and delicately establish their status, by outlining\ntheir relations to you and to each other, so that your family might\nhave a clear understanding of the situation they were asked to\nface.",
        "This is precisely what must be done at the very beginning of a\nplaylet–the friends, who are the author’s characters, must be\nintroduced to his interested family, the audience, with every bit\nof information that is necessary to a clear understanding of the\nplaylet’s situation.  These are the roots from which the playlet\nsprings–the premise of its problem.  Precisely as “The Lollard\"\ndeclares in its opening speeches who Miss Carey is and who Angela\nMaxwell is, and that Angela is knocking at Miss Carey’s door at\ntwo o’clock in the morning because she has left Harry, her husband,\nafter a quarrel the roots of which lie in the past, so every playlet\nmust state in its very first speeches, the “whos” and “whys\"–the\npremises–out of which the playlet logically develops.",
        "The prologue of “The Villain Still Pursued Her” is an excellent\nillustration of this point.  When this very funny travesty was\nfirst produced, it did not have a prologue.  It began almost\nprecisely as the full-stage scene begins now, and the audience did\nnot know whether to take it seriously or not.  The instant he\nwatched the audience at the first performance, the author sensed\nthe problem he had to face.  He knew, then, that he would have to\ntell the next audience and every other that the playlet is a farce,\na roaring travesty, to get the full value of laughter that lies\nin the situations.  He pondered the matter and saw that if the\nannouncement in plain type on the billboards and in the program\nthat his playlet was a travesty was not enough, he would have to\ntell the audience by a plain statement from the stage before his\nplaylet began.  So he hit upon the prologue that stamps the act\nas a travesty in its very first lines, introduces the characters\nand exposes the roots out of which the action develops so clearly\nthat there cannot possibly be any mistake.  And his reward was the\nmaking over of an indifferent success into one of the most successful\ntravesties in vaudeville.",
        "This conveying to the audience of the knowledge necessary to enable\nthem to follow the plot is technically known as “exposition.”  It\nis one of the most important parts of the art of construction–indeed,\nit is a sure test of a playwright’s dexterity.  While there are\nvarious ways of offering preliminary information in the long\ndrama–that is, it may be presented all at once in the opening\nscene of the first act, or homeopathically throughout the first\nact, or some minor bits of necessary information may be postponed\neven until the opening of the second act–there is only one way\nof presenting the information necessary to the understanding of\nthe playlet:  It must all be compressed into the very first speeches\nof the opening scene.",
        "The clever playlet writer is advertised by the ease–the\nsimplicity–with which he condenses every bit of the exposition\ninto the opening speeches.  You are right in the middle of things\nbefore you realize it and it is all done so skillfully that its\nstraightforwardness leaves never a suspicion that the simplicity\nis not innate but manufactured; it seems artless, yet its artlessness\nis the height of art.  The beginning of a playlet, then, must\nconvey to the audience every bit of information about the characters\nand their relations to each other that is necessary for clear\nunderstanding.  Furthermore, it must tell it all compactly and\nswiftly in the very first speeches, and by the seeming artlessness\nof its opening events it must state the problem so simply that\nwhat follows is foreshadowed and seems not only natural but\ninevitable.",
        "For the purpose of perfect understanding, I would define the\n“middle” of a playlet as that part which carries the story on from\nthe indispensable introduction to and into the scene of final\nsuspense–the climax–in which the chief character’s will breaks\nor triumphs and the end is decided.  In “The Lollard” this would\nbe from the entrance of Fred Saltus and his talk with Angela, to\nMiss Carey’s exposure of Fred’s “lollardness,” which breaks down\nAngela’s determination by showing her that her husband is no worse\nthan Fred and makes it certain that Harry has only to return to\nhis delightful deceptions of dress to carry her off with him home.",
        "(a) The “Exciting Force.” The beginning of the action that we\nhave agreed to call the middle of a playlet, is technically termed\n“the exciting force.”  The substance of the whole matter is this:\nRemember what your story is and tell it with all the dramatic force\nwith which you are endowed.",
        "Perhaps the most common, and certainly the very best, place to\n“start the trouble\"–to put the exciting force which arouses the\ncharacters to conflict–is the very first possible instant after\nthe clear, forceful and foreshadowing introduction.  The introduction\nhas started the action of the story, the chief characters have\nshown what they are and the interest of the audience has been\nawakened.  Now you must clinch that interest by having something\nhappen that is novel, and promises in the division of personal\ninterests which grow out of it to hold a punch that will stir the\nsympathies legitimately and deeply.",
        "(b) The “Rising Movement.” This exciting force is the beginning\nof what pundits call “the rising movement\"–in simple words, the\naction which from now on increases in meaning vital to the characters\nand their destinies.  What happens, of course, depends upon the\nmaterial and the treatment, but there is one point that requires\na moment’s discussion here, although closely linked with the ability\nto seize upon the dramatic–if it is not, itself, the heart of the\ndramatic.  This important point is, that in every story set for\nthe stage, there are certain",
        "(c) Scenes that Must be Shown.  From the first dawn of drama\nuntil today, when the motion pictures are facing the very same\nnecessity, the problem that has vexed playwrights most is the\nselection of what scenes must be shown.  These all-important scenes\nare the incidents of the story or the interviews between characters\nthat cannot be recounted by other characters.  Call them dramatic\nscenes, essential scenes, what you will, if they are not shown\nactually happening, but are described by dialogue–the interest\nof the audience will lag and each person from the first seat in\nthe orchestra to the last bench in the gallery will be disappointed\nand dissatisfied.  For instance:",
        "If, instead of Fred Saltus’ appearing before the audience and\nhaving his humorously thoughtless but nevertheless momentous talk\nwith Angela in which Angela falls in love with him, the interview\nhad been told the audience by Miss Carey, there would have been\nno playlet.  Nearly as important is the prologue of “The Villian\nStill Pursued Her\"; Mr. Denvir found it absolutely necessary to\nshow those characters to the audience, so that they might see them\nwith their own eyes in their farcical relations to each other,\nbefore he secured the effect that made his playlet.  Turn to “The\nSystem” and try to find even one scene there shown that could be\nreplaced by narrative dialogue and you will see once more how\nimportant are the “scenes that must be shown.”",
        "One of the all-rules-in-one for writing drama that I have heard,\nthough I cannot now recall what playwright told me, deals with\nprecisely this point.  He expressed it this way:  “First tell your\naudience what you are going to do, then show it to them happening,\nand then tell ’em it has happened!”  You will not make a mistake,\nof course, if you show the audience those events in which the\ndramatic conflict enters.  The soul of a playlet is the clash of\nthe wills of the characters, from which fly the revealing flashes;\na playlet, therefore, loses interest for the audience when the\nscenes in which those wills clash and flash revealingly are not\nshown.",
        "It is out of such revealing scenes that the rising movement grows,\nas Freytag says, “with a progressive intensity of interest.”  But,\nnot only must the events progress and the climax be brought nearer,\nbut the scenes themselves must broaden with force and revealing\npower.  They must grow until there comes one big scene–\"big” in\nevery way–somewhere on the toes of the ending, a scene next to\nthe last or the last itself.",
        "(d) The Climax.  Here is where the decisive blow is struck in a\nmoment when the action becomes throbbing and revealing in every\nword and movement.  In “The Lollard” it is when Fred makes his\nrevealing dash through the room–this is the dramatic blow which\nbreaks Angela’s infatuation.  It is the crowning point of the\ncrowning scene in which the forces of the playlet culminate, and\nthe “heart wallop\"–as Tom Barry calls it [1]–is delivered and\nthe decision is won and made.",
        "[1] Vaudeville Appeal and the “Heart Wallop,” by Tom Barry, author\nof The Upstart and Brother Fans, an interesting article in The\nDramatic Mirror of December 16, 1914.  For this and other valuable\ninformation I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness and to express\nmy thanks to The Dramatic Mirror and its courteous Vaudeville\nEditor, Frederick James Smith.",
        "Whatever this decision may be and however it is won and made, the\nclimax must be first of all a real climax–it must be “big,” whether\nit be a comedy scream or the seldom-seen tragic tear.  Big in\nmovement and expression it must be, depending for effect not on\nwords but on the revealing flash; it must be the summit of the\naction; it must be the event toward which the entire movement has\nbeen rising; it must be the fulfillment of what was foreshadowed;\nit must be keen, quick, perfectly logical and flash the illuminating\nrevelation, as if one would say, “Here, this is what I’ve kept you\nwaiting for–my whole reason for being.”  Need I say that such a\nclimax will be worth while?",
        "And now, as the climax is the scene toward which every moment of\nthe playlet–from the first word of the introduction and the first\nscene-statement of the playlet’s problem–has been motivated, and\ntoward which it has risen and culminated, so also the climax holds\nwithin itself the elements from which develops the ending.",
        "For the purpose of clearness, let me define the ending of a playlet\nas a scene that lies between the climax or culminating scene–in\nwhich the audience has been made to feel the coming-to-an-end\neffect–and the very last word on which the curtain descends.  If\nyou have ever watched a sailor splicing a rope, you will know what\nI mean when I say that the worker, reaching for the loose ends to\nfinish the job off neatly, is like the playlet writer who reaches\nhere and there for the playlet’s loose ends and gathers them all\nup into a neat, workmanlike finish.  The ending of a playlet must\nnot leave unfulfilled any promises of the premise, but must fulfill\nthem all satisfyingly.",
        "The characteristics of a good playlet ending–besides the completeness\nwith which the problem has been “proved” and the satisfyingness\nwith which it all rounds out–are terseness, speed and “punch.\"\nIf the climax is a part of the playlet wherein words may not be\nsquandered, the ending is the place where words–you will know\nwhat I mean–may not be used at all.  Everything that must be\nexplained must be told by means which reach into the spectator’s\nmemory of what has gone before and make it the positive pole of\nthe battery from which flash the wireless messages from the scene\nof action.  As Emerson defined character as that which acts by\nmere presence without words, let me define the ending of a playlet\nas that which acts without words by the simple bringing together\nof the characters in their new relations.",
        "The climax has said to the audience, “Here, this is what I’ve kept\nyou waiting for–my whole reason for being,” therefore the ending\ncannot dally–it must run swiftly to the final word.  There is no\nexcuse for the ending to linger over anything at all–the shot has\nbeen fired and the audience waits only for the smoke to clear away,\nthat it may see how the bull’s-eye looks.  The swifter you can blow\nthe smoke away, show them that you’ve hit the bull’s-eye dead in the\ncentre, and bow yourself off amid their pleased applause, the better\nyour impression will be.",
        "Take these three examples:",
        "When Fred Saltus dashes revealingly across the stage and back into\nhis room again, “The Lollard’s” climax is reached; and as soon\nas Angela exclaims “What ’a lollard’ that is!” there’s a ring\nat the door bell and in comes Harry to win Angela completely with\nhis regimentals and to carry her off and bring the curtain down–\nin eight very short speeches.",
        "In “The System,” the climax arrives when the honest Inspector\norders Dugan arrested and led away.  Then he gives “The Eel” and\nGoldie their freedom and exits with a simple “Good Night\"–and the\ncurtain comes down–all in seven speeches.",
        "The climax of “Blackmail” seems to come when Fallon shoots Mohun\nand Kelly breaks into the room–to the curtain it is seven\nspeeches.  But the real climax is reached when Kelly shouts over\nthe telephone “Of course, in self-defense, you fool, of course,\nin self-defense.”  This is–the last speech.",
        "Convincing evidence, is this not, of the speed with which the\ncurtain must follow the climax?",
        "And so we have come, to this most important point–the “finish\"\nor “the curtain,” as vaudeville calls it.  The very last thing\nthat must be shown, and the final word that must be said before\nthe curtain comes down, are the last loose ends of the plot which\nmust be spliced into place–the final illuminating word to round\nout the whole playlet humanly and cleverly.  “The Lollard” goes\nback to Miss Carey’s sleep, which Angela’s knock on the door\ninterrupted:  “Now, thank Gawd, I’ll get a little sleep,” says Miss\nCarey as she puts out the light.  A human, an everyday word it is,\nspoken like a reminiscent thrill–and down comes the curtain amid\nlaughter and applause.  A fine way to end.",
        "But not the only way–let us examine “The System.”",
        "“Well, we’re broke again,” says Goldie tearfully.  “We can’t go\nWest now, so there’s no use packing.”  Now, note the use of business\nin the ending, and the surprise.  The Eel goes stealthily to the\nwindow L, looks out, and pulls the dictograph from the wall.  Then\nhe comes down stage to Goldie who is sitting on the trunk and has\nwatched him.  He taps her on the shoulder, taking Dugan’s red\nwallet out of his pocket.  “Go right ahead and pack,” says The\nEel, while Goldie looks astonished and begins to laugh.  The\naudience, too, look astonished and begin to laugh when they see\nthat red wallet.  It is a surprise–a surprise so cleverly constructed\nthat it hits the audience hard just above the laughter-and-applause-belt–\na surprise that made the act at least twenty-five per cent better\nthan it would have been without it.  And from it we may now draw\nthe “rules” for the use of that most helpful and most dangerous\nelement, surprise in the vaudeville finish:",
        "Note first, that it was entirely logical for The Eel to steal the\nwallet–he is a pickpocket.  Second, that the theft of the wallet\nis not of trivial importance to Goldie’s destiny and to his–they\nare “broke” and they must get away; the money solves all their\nproblems.  And third, note that while The Eel’s possession of the\nwallet is a surprise, the wallet itself is not a surprise–it\nhas first played a most important part in the tempting of Goldie\nand has been shown to the audience not once but many times; and\nits very color–red–makes it instantly recognizable; the spectators\nknow what it contains and what its contents mean to the destinies\nof both The Eel and Goldie–it is only that The Eel has it, that\nconstitutes the surprise.",
        "Now I must sound a warning against striving too hard after a\nsurprise finish.  The very nature of many playlets makes it\nimpossible to give them such a curtain.  If you have built up a\nstory which touches the heart and brings tears to the eyes, and\nthen turn it all into a joke, the chances are the audience will\nfeel that their sympathies have been outraged, and so the playlet\nwill fail.  For instance, one playlet was ruined because right on\ntop of the big, absorbing climax two of the characters who were\nthen off stage stuck their heads in at the door and shouted at the\nhero of the tense situation, “April Fool.”",
        "Therefore, the following may be considered as an important “rule\";\na playlet that touches the heart should never end with a trick or\na surprise. [1]",
        "[1] See Chapter XVIII, section III, par. 4.",
        "Now, let me sum up these four elements of surprise:",
        "A surprise finish must be fitting, logical, vitally important,\n  and revealingly dramatic; if you cannot give a playlet a\n  surprise-finish that shall be all of these four things at once,\n  be content with the simpler ending.",
        "The importance of a playlet’s ending is so well understood in\nvaudeville that the insistence upon a “great finish” to every\nplaylet has sometimes seemed to be over-insistence, for, important\nas it is, it is no more important than a “great opening” and “great\nscenes.”  The ending is, of course, the final thing that quickens\napplause, and, coming last and being freshest in the mind of the\naudience, it is more likely to carry just a fair act to success\nthan a fine act is likely to win with the handicap of a poor finish.\nBut, discounting this to be a bit under the current valuation of\n“great finishes,” we still may round out this discussion of the\nplaylet’s three important parts, with this temperate sentence:",
        "A well constructed playlet plot is one whose Beginning states\n  the premises of its problem clearly and simply, whose Middle\n  develops the problem logically and solves the entanglement in a\n  “big” scene, and whose Ending rounds out the whole satisfyingly–\n  with a surprise, if fitting.",
        "But, temperate and helpful as this statement of a well constructed\nplot may be, there is something lacking in it.  And that something\nlacking is the very highest test of plot–lightly touched on at\nvarious times, but which, although it enters into a playwright’s\ncalculations every step of the way, could not be logically considered\nin this treatise until the structure had been examined as a whole:\nI mean the formidable-sounding, but really very simple dramatic\nunities.",
        "Now, but only for a moment, we must return to the straight line\nof investigation from which we swerved in considering the structural\nparts of a playlet plot.",
        "At the beginning of this chapter we saw that a simple narrative\nof events is made a plot by the addition of a crisis or entanglement,\nand its resolution or untying.  Now, the point I wish to present\nwith all the emphasis at my command, is that complication does not\nmean complexity.",
        "In other words, no matter how many events you place one after\nanother–no matter how you pile incident upon incident–you will\nnot have a plot unless you so inter-relate them that the removal\nof anyone event will destroy the whole story.  Each event must\ndepend on the one preceding it, and in turn form a basis for the\none following, and each must depend upon all the others so vitally\nthat if you take one away the whole collapses. [1]",
        "[1] See Aristotle, Poetics, Chapter VIII, and also Poe’s criticism,\nThe American Drama.",
        "(a) Unity of Hero is not Unity of Action. One of the great errors\ninto which the novice is likely to fall, is to believe that because\nhe makes every event which happens happen to the hero, he is\nobserving the rule of unity.  Nothing could be farther from the\ntruth–nothing is so detrimental to successful plot construction.\n[2]",
        "[2] See Freytag’s Technique of the Drama, p. 36.",
        "Aristotle tried to correct this evil, which he saw in the plays\nof the great Athenian poets, by saying:  “The action is the first\nand most important thing, the characters only second;” and, “The\naction is not given unity by being made to concern only one person.”",
        "Remember, unity of action means unity of story.",
        "(b) Double-Action is Dangerous to Unity.  If you have a scene\nin which two minor characters come together for a reason vital to\nthe plot, you must be extremely careful not to tell anything more\nthan the facts that are vital.  In long plays the use of what is\ncalled “double-action “–that is, giving to characters necessary\nto the plot an interest and a destiny separate from that of the\nchief characters–is, of course, recognized and productive of fine\nresults.  But, even in the five-act play, the use of double-action\nis dangerous.  For instance:  Shakespere developed Falstaff so\nhumorously that today we sometimes carelessly think of “Henry IV\"\nas a delightful comedy, when in reality it was designed as a serious\ndrama–and is most serious, when Falstaff’s lines are cut from the\nreading version to the right proportions for to-day’s stage effect.\nIf Shakespere nodded, it is a nod even the legitimate dramatist\nof today should take to heart, and the playlet writer–peculiarly\nrestricted as to time–must engrave deeply in his memory.",
        "The only way to secure unity of action is to concentrate upon your\nproblem or theme; to realize that you are telling a story; to\nremember that each character, even your hero, is only a pawn to\nadvance the story; and to cut away rigorously all non-essential\nevents.  If you will bear in mind that a playlet is only as good\nas its plot, that a plot is a story and that you must give to\nyour story, as has been said, “A completeness–a kind of universal\ndovetailedness, a sort of general oneness,” you will have little\ndifficulty in observing the one playlet rule that should never be\nbroken–Unity of action.",
        "The second of the classical unities, unity of time, is peculiarly\nperplexing, if you study to “understand” and not merely to write.\nBriefly–for I must reiterate that our purpose is practice and not\ntheory–the dramatists of every age since Aristotle have quarreled\nover the never-to-be-settled problem of what space of time a play\nshould be permitted to represent.  Those who take the stand that\nno play should be allowed to show an action that would require\nmore than twenty-four hours for the occurrences in real life, base\ntheir premise on the imitative quality of the stage, rather than\nupon the selective quality of art.  While those who contend that\na play may disregard the classical unity of time, if only it\npreserves the unity of action, base their contention upon the fact\nthat an audience is interested not in time at all–but in story.\nIn other words, a play preserves the only unity worth preserving\nwhen it deals with the incidents that cause a crisis and ends by\nshowing its effect, no matter whether the action takes story-years\nto occur or happens all in a story-hour.",
        "If we were studying the long drama it might be worth our while to\nconsider the various angles of this ancient dispute, but, fortunately,\nwe have a practical and, therefore, better standard by which to\nstate this unity in its application to the playlet.  Let us approach\nthe matter in this way:",
        "Vaudeville is variety–it strives to compress into the space of\nabout two hours and a half a great number of different acts which\nrun the gamut of the entertainment forms, and therefore it cannot\nafford more than an average of twenty minutes to each.  This time\nlimit makes it difficult for a playlet to present effectively any\nstory that does not occur in consecutive minutes.  It has been\nfound that even the lowering of the curtain for one second to\ndenote the lapse of an hour or a year, has a tendency to distract\nthe minds of the audience from the story and to weaken the singleness\nof effect without which a playlet is nothing.",
        "On the other hand, this “rule” is not unbreakable:  a master\ncraftsman’s genius is above all laws.  In “The System” the first\nscene takes place in the evening; scene two, a little later the\nsame evening; and scene three later that same night.  The story\nis really continuous in time, but the story-time is not equal to\nthe playing-time even though this playlet consumes nearly twice\ntwenty minutes.  But, you will note, the scenery changes help to\nkeep the interest of the audience from flagging, and also stamp\nthe lapses of time effectively.",
        "A still greater violation of the “rule\"–if it were stated as\nabsolutely rigid–is to be found in Mr. Granville’s later act,\n“The Yellow Streak,” written in collaboration with James Madison.\nHere scene two takes place later in the evening of the first scene,\nand the third scene after a lapse of four months.  But these two\nexceptions, out of many that might be cited, merely prove that\ndramatic genius can mold even the rigid time of the vaudeville\nstage to its needs.",
        "Of course, there is the possibility of foreshortening time to meet\nthe exigencies of vaudeville when the scene is not changed.  For\ninstance:  a character telephones that he will be right over and\nsolve the whole situation on which the punch of the playlet depends,\nand he enters five actual minutes later–although in real life it\nwould take an hour to make the trip.  This is an extreme instance,\nas time foreshortening goes, because it is one where the audience\nmight grasp the disparity, and is given for its side-light of\nwarning as well as for its suggestive value.",
        "More simple foreshortenings of time are found in many playlets\nwhere the effect of an hour-or-more of events is compressed into\nthe average twenty minutes.  As an example of this perfectly safe\nuse of shortening, note the quickness with which Harry returns to\nMiss Carey’s apartment when he goes out to change into his\nregimentals.  And as still safer foreshortenings, note the quickness\nwith which Fred Saltus enters after Miss Carey goes to bed leaving\nAngela on the couch; and the quickness with which Angela falls in\nlove with him–in fact, the entire compression inherent in the\ndramatic events which cannot be dissociated from time compression.",
        "A safe attitude for a playlet writer to take, is that all of his\naction shall mimic time reality as closely as his dramatic moment\nand the time-allowance of presentation will permit.  This is\nconsidered in all dramatic art to be the ideal.",
        "A good way to obviate disparaging comparison is to avoid reference\nto time–either in the dialogue or by the movements of events.",
        "To sum up the whole matter, a vaudeville playlet may be considered\nas preserving unity of time when its action occurs in continuous\nminutes of about the length the episode would take to occur in\nreal life.",
        "The commercial element of vaudeville often makes it inadvisable\nfor a playlet to show more than one scene–very often an otherwise\nacceptable playlet is refused production because the cost of\nsupplying special scenes makes it a bad business venture. [1]",
        "[1] See Chapter III.",
        "Yet it is permissible for a writer to give his playlet more than\none place of happening–if he can make his story so compact and\ngripping that it does not lose in effect by the unavoidable few\nseconds’ wait necessary to the changing of the scenery.  But, even\nif his playlet is so big and dramatic that it admits of a change\nof scenes, he must conform it to the obvious vaudeville necessity\nof scenic alternation. [2] With this scenic “rule” the matter of\nunity of place in the playlet turns to the question of a playwright’s\nart, which rules cannot limit.",
        "[2] See Chapter I.",
        "This third and last unity of the playlet may, however, for all\nsave the master-craftsman, be safely stated as follows:",
        "Except in rare instances a playlet should deal with a story that\nrequires but one set of scenery, thus conserving the necessities\nof commercial vaudeville, aiding the smooth running of a performance,\nand preserving the dramatic unity of place.",
        "We may now condense the three dramatic unities into a statement\npeculiarly applicable to the playlet–which would seem as though\nspecially designed to fulfill them all:",
        "A playlet preserves the dramatic unities when it shows one action\n  in one time and in one place.",
        "And now it may be worth while once more to sum up what I have said\nabout the elements of plot–of which the skeleton of every playlet\nmust be made up:",
        "A mere sequence of events is not a plot; to become a plot there\nmust develop a crisis or entanglement due to a conflict of the\ncharacters’ wills; the entanglement must be of such importance\nthat when it is untangled the characters will be in a different\nrelation to each other–changed in themselves by the crisis.  A\nplot is divided into three parts:  a Beginning, a Middle and an\nEnding.  The Beginning must state the premises of the playlet’s\nproblem clearly and simply; the Middle must develop the problem\nlogically and solve the entanglement in a “big” scene, and the\nEnding must round out the whole satisfyingly–with a surprise, if\nfitting.  A plot, furthermore, must be so constructed that the\nremoval of anyone of its component parts will be detrimental to\nthe whole.  It is told best when its action occurs in continuous\ntime of about the length the episode would take to occur in real\nlife and does not require the changing of scenery.  Thus will a\nplaylet be made to give the singleness of effect that is the height\nof playlet art.",
